Harry cooks looks like Gordon Ramsey. He's chiseled like Adonis. Flies like a pro. Flirts like Lockhart. All the girls want him and the guys hate him.

But he doesn't hump everything with legs. Pre or post war. Doesn't even need to include a war.

Completed fics prefered. Any fic recommendations that match?


** Now Harry needs to be born after Lily and James are killed.

Then James can send his only son to Earth to save them from the living embodiment of evil.

** I don't know how to use the bot but "Harry Potter and the Daft Morons" should work for you.\\
The fic is a harem and scream wish fulfilment (with the good old family alliance and veela bond clichés) but yeah, Harry is pretty much mister perfect there.\\
Even remember a line where Harry say he doesn't cook, but chef.

**** Yeah this one sound really edgy. Thought depending of the context I can kinda understand it. I mean, dueling (as in professional dueling) as rules, unlike fighting. I'm pretty sure Dumbledore style in his duel against Voldemort would not be accepted in the professional circuit.

There was one cracky fic where a full cliche Indi! Harry confronted a manipulative Dumbledore where Dumbledore told him Dueling was useless in a battlefield because you are used to one opponent in front of you and to hold back while in a true battle you can be killed by behind and should not stop until your enemy is dead or completely controlled.
