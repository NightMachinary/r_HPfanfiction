** Kudos for deciding to write fanfiction! I would say the first idea has more potential for you to put your own spin on. There are many fics of Harry joining the Avengers, but less Star Wars crossovers. Also you seemed to have planned out the first one more and I think you should go with the one you've thought about and written out the most. The first idea seems much more original and there's a lot of different avenues you can go down in terms of plot line. If you need a beta to bounce ideas off of feel free to PM me or check out the list of available betas on ffn [[https://www.fanfiction.net/betareaders/][here]]

Hope this helps!

** Agree with above, you have worked out more of the story with the first idea. The second feels like you just threw an idea together quick with no thought.

I would suggest you take the time to make the star wars timeline clear so you can choose an accurate time for the prophecy to take place. The way you described it made me feel like thousands of years passed since they saw him and decided to fight like him and the prophecy would start. You will need to come up with backstory for Harry for what he does for all the time that passes if it is that long.
