that makes you cringe the most and go oh my god i did not write that?! The worst tropes you've used, worst ideas, etc I wanna hear all y'alls dirty secret fics

Mine was called "Beauty". It was about this Pureblood Squib who turned to the Muggle World for comfort and peace, and to fit in. She became a psychologist specializing in sociopaths. When the second war broke out again, she decided to go back to the wizarding world, after a while she offered her services to Dumbledore as a criminal profiler that could help identify what he was thinking, what his next move might be etc. Meanwhile while she was in the Muggle World she had been researching, experimenting and trying to find a cure for Sociopaths, and who better to experiment on than Voldemort? So as she learns of Voldie and his past and profiles him. She begins to understand him a bit more. And meets the people who knew him before he was the Dark Lord and some of his victims that survived. It all was her trying to cure voldemort of his sociopathy with confrontations, experiments, etc etc while working with the order.

I cringe cause of so many things. Mostly the 'Voldemort could turn good' thing which I HATE. If you are going to try that it would hav been a YOUNG Tom riddle imo. So seeing I used one of the tropes i despise the most made me cringe

  When the machinations of an eldar fareer drop an entire world full of Imperial Guard, Orks, and Eldar into the Mass Effect Universe, both worlds are forever changed. Switches between the perspectives of Commissar Ciaphias Cain and Commander Jane Shepard. Rated M for language, adult situations and violence.

** It's kind of a toss up for me. My first two stories are pretty bad, but I guess at least the second one attempted something new. First one was written at the tail end of the indy!Harry + Daphne Greengrass manic phase. I fell into the same trap as many had fallen in before me, and many have fallen in since. I knew stuff like friendly goblins and custom wands was cliche as hell, but I thought my idea was clever and original enough, and that I was a good enough author to pull it off. I wasn't.

The annoying part is that POS is still my most popular story by far. None of my others even have a third of the views.

** Oh god. When I was 12 I wrote a self-insert songfic for an Avril Lavigne song. My main character was Sirius's sister, looked just like me, grew up in America, and became a Death Eater in the end. I actually finished it! Sadly, I have long since lost the file, and I never published it on FFN.

** I've never published anything online, or for that matter finished anything in general. But by far one of the worst stories I wrote was heavily inspired by Harry Potter and Hitchiker's Guide. The main character had some outrageously silly name-think along the lines of Harry Emrys-Gryffindor-Black-Potter etc., etc. The protagonist was also a Mary Sue with all the trappings, no flaws and extraordinarily intelligent and brilliant.

The writing itself is terrible, almost completely unreadable. Worse than almost anything that I've read on FFN.

In my defense I was twelve, but I think even by a twelve year old's standards is was pretty bad.

** Thank God I removed it from FFN shortly after writing, but when I was about 10, there was a fanfic starring Draco Malfoy's twin sister who was obviously too important to have been in the books and was prophesied to save Harry.

I wish that was the worst of it, but I clearly remember spending several chapters on Draco and his sister's summer job since the result of OoTP left them broke -- hauling water for the ministry of magic.... I don't think I understood jobs, money or virtually anything else yet lol.

** I wrote a sequel called "And Gryffindor Rebels" (the second part to "And Gryffindor Roars"). And quite honestly, I can say that while writing, I had no ending destination of where it was going to go. I was making it up as I went along. Anyway, the stories take place in an AU where Hermione is Charlie Weasley's age and she started Hogwarts in 1984 with him. In the sequel, I threw in this point of how Dumbledore takes Charlie, Hermione, Adam, and Josh (the latter two are woefully underdeveloped OC's) the night Voldemort killed James and Lily. Why? I have no idea. I did it just to do it. My execution of it was really bad and I'm surprised no one pointed that out to me. To this day (the story was published in 2015), I haven't re-read it because I just can't.

**** Ironically, I was just thinking about a re-write about a week ago. But I'm not going to push forward with it. It's a testament to have your first story posted and then one that was recently published to see how far you've come as a writer. (Well, at least I would hope any would make gains in their writing if they kept at it for a time.) I'm not going to say you shouldn't re-write it but maybe it's better to leave it as it is.

** I think the one I look back at and really just shake my head at is "The Bloodmoon Rises". linkffn(11346410)

It really was one of my first longer writing projects, which is also why I keep it up there. Looking back at it gives me a good contrast to where I am now. There were some good things in it. I think I had some good character moments. I think I had some nice dialogue from time to time and I have gotten praise for the way in which I described the smell and taste of blood for vampires. The overall thing, though, suffers from the general lack of foresight, some ugly character tropes (evil, manipulative Dumbledore) and general writing mistakes.

Some part of me has a desire to rewrite it, but then again, I'd rather just write something else.

  Voldemort not only sent his Death Eaters to the Ministry, but vampires as well. Hermione and Harry fall to them and find themselves in new, undead lives. While Harry struggles to remain human, Hermione becomes what was believed dead long ago. She becomes a Countess, an heir to Dracula. Unfortunately, there are no books on that. /Abandoned

** Thankfully, all my trash writings of a younger me were deleted and on another long-dead profile. I adored Robst's work and tried my damnedest to imitate it, unfortunately. The end result was Hermione/Harry pairings only that jumped way too fast into romance and WAY too powerful characters, not to mention good old Evil Dumbledore. I also wrote Danny Phantom fics which were just... just the absolute worst. All that frothy, angsty goodness that can only come from a preteen!
