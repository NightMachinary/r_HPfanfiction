Stories were Harry is forced to acknowledge the fact the he is not normal and he is never going to be

I also wouldn't mind Stories were harry Suffers because he keeps trying to be normal, but I don't really like Angst so would prefer stories were he gets over the fact that he is never going to be normal Quickly with minimal people suffering because of harry's Idiocy.


** That's almost every grey, dark, and indy Harry fic.

Apart from canon compliant fics, it's actually difficult to find a Harry who's forgiving and wants to be normal.

*** Forgiving and normal are in no way related. Wanting those who wronged you punished is a perfectly normal behaviour and the basis of our law system.

*** But those types of stories always have a Harry that is so uptight and angst ridden. So I was hoping somethings different.

** [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Blue_Steel/Chapter_1/]]

One of my fav authors. Little in the way of conflict but Harry learns to not try to be normal after being convinced by Romilda Vane (who is a gypsy of course) and Astoria Green grass (a Mary Sue level of knowledge) but it's a fun little romp of a story
