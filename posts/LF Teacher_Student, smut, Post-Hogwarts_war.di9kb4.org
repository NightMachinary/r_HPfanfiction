Let me know Fics that has the MC functions as a Teacher or "consultant" and one or two students find him attractive and want to sleep with him. They dont want to have "better grades" and dont expect him to give these, they just want to have fun, because they really find him attractive.

I accept a female teacher aswell.


** I read one fic where Harry was professor at Hogwarts. He fell in love with a seventh/sixth year student( OC Character). He sometimes hires her to babysit Teddy. Her best friend also loves her. Anyone remember this story? If do, please link it. I think it has a sequel too. ( not sure)

** It's not post war but I suppose it will be during the war in future chapters. It's amazingly well written. The title is It could be us by Jisane. You can find it in AO3.

** It's against Rule 8 to direct link these. I'd recommend going on AO3 and searching under the fandom for "Teacher/Student" tags until you find what you're looking for.
