One of my biggest gripes with the HP series is the fact that despite Harry, Ron, and Hermione are the main three characters of the original series, we never explore Hermione as a character to even the extent we do with Harry and Ron. Even both Ginny, Neville, and Luna have more interesting backstories and character development to them than Hermione, despite her being a bigger character than them.

You may ask "why?", and to that I say this: From an objective literary perspective, Hermione was NEVER as important as either Harry or Ron, nor even as important as Ginny, Neville, and Luna. I know that sounds like a hot take and I probably worded my title pretty poorly, but I just feel Hermione's stated importance (one of the main trio) was too different from her actual importance or lack thereof (nameless parents, unknown childhood experience, etc).

My main justification is that we never get to explore Hermione's homelife with her muggle parents to even a third the extent of what we get with the Weasleys. I feel Hermione could have been a much better written character if we got to understand her motivations and past better than canon actually explored. What do her muggle parents think of her being the best student in her year? How do they feel about their daughter keeping so many secrets regarding the true danger she puts herself in? How do they feel about Harry and Ron as her best friends? We never know, because Rowling wrote herself into a corner.

We are told Hermione is equally important as Ron, yet if you look at the HP series objectively, the order of character importance would probably be closer to Harry > Ron => Ginny > Neville > Luna > Hermione. Even characters such as Snape, Lupin and Sirius feel more important to the series than Hermione due to this dissonance.

To me, Hermione is the Sakura Haruno of the HP Trio regarding her development. Naruto and Sasuke both had very detailed backstories and motivations for the future. We knew Naruto and Sasuke's families. We knew nothing about Sakura's, despite her being a main character... even when characters like Hinata, Shikamaru, and Gaara had much better development than Sakura in this regard.

Hermione is the same to me. We are told that Harry is the main character, and that both Ron and Hermione are equally the second most important character. Despite this, Hermione's character can be summed up as being "the smart girl" and "the token muggleborn". That is what I would call "bad writing" if Hermione's backstory is far, far less interesting than Ron, Neville, Luna, or a host of other characters in the series despite Hermione being one of the three main characters. If Hermione's entire worth can be summed so easily, it speaks volumes of how little was done with her as an actual character rather than as a cliche. Other characters like Harry, Ron, Ginny, Neville, and Luna feel more complete than her.

Among the major characters of the HP series (Harry, Ron, Hermione, Snape, Dumbledore, Voldemort) or even just to the main six (Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Neville, Luna), Hermione's backstory and character felt by far the least interesting because there was so little of it in canon compared to what we got with those other characters.

*TL;DR: Hermione's backstory is terrible considering she's meant to be one of the three main characters. She is the Sakura Haruno of the main HP Trio when she never should have been. Hermione's character would have been better if we got to explore Hermione's muggle life for a chapter, and how decent muggle parents interact with their muggleborn children, and see Hermione increasingly distancing herself from the muggle world as she gets older. Hermione's backstory is far outclassed by Ron and Ginny's backstory, and also by the likes of Neville and Luna.*


** I mean... not all character development is in backstory, though. If anything, Hermione could be seen as the Everyman for the most likely demographic of readers, as someone from a normal family who never knew about magic and then dove fully into learning everything about it that she could; her development, instead is in what she does /during/ the story. Hermione isn't about her background or some prophecy; she's about how a lonely girl made friends, learned to break the rules when she needed to, and eventually grew into the most serious (and ruthless) warrior at Harry's side.

I agree with this and it's /because/ of Hermione specifically that I decided this was true. I can only speak for myself, but I really do think Hermione is one of the best written characters in this series, and sure, I'm interested in her backstory, but only from a world-building perspective, because from a literary and character-arc perspective, she's got the most reasonable and consistent arc out of anyone and it's an absolute treasure to read her scenes. She runs off to the library so often it's practically a joke, except that it never is used as a cheap gag, because her running to the library is /always/ related to the plot. Her characterization interacts with the plot and the plot interacts with her so effortlessly, and I think that is just one of many signs that she is a very well-written character.

Everything she learns and every mistake she makes actually advances her character. She starts off believing everything she reads, but discoving Lockhart was a fraud made her realize the written word is only as good as the author. /Hogwarts, A History/ made her realize that books gloss over history and facts by not mentioning house-elves, which reinforces what she learned with Lockhart: that just because someone wrote it, doesn't mean it's true, something that helped Hermione handle Rita Skeeter's threats which gave Hermione room to discover her revenge streak, which prepared her for Umbridge when she came into the first day's class not only having read the entire assigned book, but also with a plan to peacefully undermine Umbridge's agenda, and this prepared her for Dumbledore's Army, which prepared her for the war. Another branch of this is the HBP, she is skeptical of the Half-Blood Prince not because his spells are bad, but because she's known for years that the written word can't be taken at face value and there's worth in understanding the author (fiction works aside), and she accepts the HBP's spells only after she knows the context of how the book was written. And it's this aspect of her character, her need to understand the context and the author, that Dumbledore recognizes in her and why he gives her the Tales of Beedle the Bard.

I think it's a bit short-sighted to overlook seven books of characterization to say that because we don't know much about her life before Hogwarts that she is an example of bad-writing. Backstory can be absolutely the best part of some characters (Dumbledore, Snape, Lupin, and many others are great examples of this), but in Hermione's case, what makes her interesting is how she develops in real time.

I do agree with OP's statement that Hermione's backstory is bad compared to the others, but I disagree with the implication that this is necessarily a problem or a sign of bad writing.

**** As a fic writer, I've got to say that a character like Hermione, with virtually no backstory but exquisite character development in the text like you've just described, is an absolute gift. There are so many possibilities to explore with regards to how she got to be the person we meet in PS, it's brilliant.

So yeah, Hermione having no fleshed-out backstory (but coupled with arguably the best character arc in the entire series) is definitely a feature, not a bug.

*** I'm not sure I agree with the everyman theory. Most everyman characters are the ones we experience the story through: Watson, Bella Swan, etc. They tend to be inexperienced in the world they're suddenly a part of and we as readers get to experience and learn things about the world as they do. In this case, Harry's our everyman, even though he's the chosen one, because he knows the least about the wizarding world. Although he's very famous and the focus of a prophecy, he still reacts to this the way the average person would. Hermione, on the other hand, knows more about the wizarding world than even Ron, a pureblood, does on many occasions because she reads.

Rowling has acknowledged that Hermione is most like herself on many occasions, and I think what we're seeing is a more or less a self-insert. Hermione doesn't have the most fleshed out backstory, because Rowling knows her too well. And this isn't a dig against Rowling in any way, even Bilbo Baggins is a self-insert with no backstory!

***** Oh, I definitely feel the same! Hermione is one of my favorite characters because I related to her the most, but as far as being an everyman, I don't find her to be. She always knows the information before everyone else, because she's taken the time to research it.

I mean, if I suddenly got my Hogwarts letter, you can be damn sure I'd read every scrap of information I could get my hands on before showing up at school, because that is what I'm like. I'd also be bitter if everyone always expected me to review their homework, because that's happened to me before. (I even have the hair!)

But we never get to see from her point of view that spark of revelation as she reads a new piece of information, or feel the triumph as she's reading something that proves a theory, and only know that's she's been studying from Harry's perspective. From that viewpoint, I'd say she's more of a mentor/font of knowledge character with a good bit of voice of reason thrown in.

This interpretation may just have to do with my personal take on the definition of everyman. I understand the everyman to be the bridge between the new and unknown world that the reader and the character have been thrust into, which in this case I think is Harry.

*** My problem is that if Hermione can be seen as the Everyman, why do we never get to explore that further? We are told Hermione is a muggle-born and see her nameless muggle parents for all of a page or two in the second book, but after that, nothing.

I feel Rowling missed an opportunity to really explore what the family life of a muggleborn would feel like for the child and the parents. The most we get is Hermione saying that they can at least understand what being a prefect means, suggesting that her parents don't really understand her. It would be interesting to have explored this further, such as what Hermione thought of her parents not understanding her, or how her parents felt about their daughter becoming so distant from them over time.

I'm not saying that very character needs to have some super-amazing backstory or anything, but Hermione was one of the main three characters of the series. Like Sakura Haruno in the Naruto series, there are basic expectations that main characters have better, fleshed-out backstories than side characters. If Hermione was just a side character (i.e. Ginny or Luna), then I wouldn't be making this topic. But I feel that Hermione's character should be more than just "girl who is smart" and "girl with muggle parents" since it feels shallow and weak compared to the side characters with far more interesting stories (e.g. Ginny, Luna, Neville, Sirius, Lupin, Snape, etc.)

If Hermione was meant to be the Everyman, I feel Ron and Luna in particular were both far more suited for being the Everyman to the most likely demographic of readers than Hermione. Ron was a boy from a poor family who didn't put in as much effort as he could since he felt overshadowed by the rest of his family, and had his family tarred as "blood traitors". Luna was a girl who experienced parental loss at a young age, experienced bullying from other Ravenclaws, and was considered illogical even by magical standards.

By contrast, Hermione is an upper-middle class girl who is the smartest in her class with two loving parents, was never bullied or discriminated against until she entered the wizarding world, and was based on Rowling when she was younger. By comparison, Hermione is far less relatable than Harry and Ron to the majority of readers, is even less relatable when compared to Ron and Luna, and somehow gets even less relatable in the movies when her only "flaw" of being an average-looking girl was non-existent.

The girl who tries to be the voice of reason when Harry or Ron tries to go off the rails, not rolls her eyes when they are immature - but still enjoys their escapades?

Perhaps you were just not the target demographic when you read this book.

** This doesn't seem like poor writing on JKR's part. Harry is, in general, oblivious. He doesn't seem to go out of his way to ask people for personal information (or perhaps trivial conversations like "How're your parents?" don't make it to the books)

People are mentioned in the story when they're relevant to the plot (eg Xenophilius Lovegood/ Frank and Alice Longbottom) or if Harry spends a lot of time with them (the Weasleys). The Grangers fall into neither of these categories.

I agree, though, that Hermione's relationship with her parents is an interesting new angle since it's bridging two worlds. Many fanfics touch on this subject, but overall not very satisfactorily.

And Muggles are never relevant to the plot.

Much as you punish someone who kicks a puppy, wizards who abuse Muggles are to be punished. And just as you love your dog, wizards may have great affection for Muggles. But a Muggle is never /useful/ or /important/. This is the position not only held by wizards but also endorsed by the narrative itself, in that the three main characters (including the one who is Muggleborn) all hold this attitude.

Hermione is just as important as Ron to the story. Her "backstory" isn't mentioned for the sole reason that there is nothing worth saying about Muggles.

Clearly the narrative and the world cares a lot about muggles.

** Not sure I buy this, honestly. We do get a few throwaway lines of the Grangers interacting with the magical world - I'm pretty sure there's a scene or two about them needing help with changing money at Gringotts and getting Arthur Weasley all worked up. That said, characters get explored in HP when they have something to add to the narrative. We don't learn much about what it's like for the richer purebloods, because it doesn't add much to Harry's story. The Weasleys and The Burrow get explored because that's how Harry experiences a loving family for the first time.

In terms of viewpoint, Harry provides the same attitude and biases that the Grangers would. Ron is the street-smart kid who knows everything wizards are expected to know about wizard culture, Hermione knows everything books would teach you, but not much about unspoken things, and Harry is a complete newcomer who's overawed by everything. The Grangers would have just been two new Harrys or Hermiones, depending on how much they read up on everything. So they aren't contributing anything in terms of narrative or viewpoint. Why bother exploring them? Sure, it would be interesting to see, but given how much of any manuscript ends up on the cutting room floor, I can totally see an editor saying "Why are we focusing so much on the dentists when you have an entire wizard world to flesh out?"

By importance, I mean in terms of what they are and what we learn about them rather than what they actually do in the series. What I really mean in terms of importance is their role and backstory, though in almost all examples of media, the main characters with the most appearances are often the most important characters in said work. Logically, you'd think that the most important character would be Harry, and then both Ron and Hermione would be tied for second, given that those three are the main character. Yet as readers, we learn much more about so many other characters than Hermione, and it doesn't make sense given her importance as a main character.

Obviously Harry is the most important of those six I mentioned, since he's the protagonist and the character whose perspective we view the series from. Following that would be Ron, given that we know more about him and his backstory than the aforementioned characters minus Harry. Ginny is arguably equal or slightly below Ron, given that she doesn't appear in the series as much as Ron and Hermione do. We learn quite a bit about Neville's life pre-Hogwarts like how he was dropped from a window and bounced, and that he lived with his grandmother, and Neville's importance only increased following GoF and even moreso during OotP. Finally, Luna's backstory makes her a bigger character than Hermione but that doesn't say much. The problem with Luna is that she debuts in OotP, meaning she's appears the least out of all six of these characters by far. However we learn enough about her life to actually flesh her character out a bit from being just a generic character.

On a related note, I enjoyed "The Other Minister" chapter of HBP because it touched upon a commonly-wondered topic at the time: How was the muggle world impacted by the wizarding world. We see how the Muggle Prime Minister is powerless to stop these things that seemingly happen unexplainably, only for Fudge to inform him of magic and the magical world. The prime minister's dialogue with Fudge and then Scrimgeour shows a muggle perspective of magic not from the perspective of someone who hates magic (i.e. Vernon Dursley) but from someone clueless about magic yet holding a grand position of power. He thought that magic, rather than something to fear, was something that could solve any problem. Though, as Scrimgeour told him, didn't take into account that the other side also has magic.

Given that Hermione is more intelligent and knowledgeable than Harry, it would have been interesting to see a very-early chapter from her perspective (i.e. similarly to chapters like "The Riddle House" and "The Other Minister"). The muggle world is understandably not presented that positively by Harry due to Harry's own childhood under the Dursleys coupled with the far superior experience of Hogwarts and the Burrow. I think that seeing muggles and the muggle world from the perspective of an actual muggleborn raised by two parents who love her would provide a different take on muggles and the muggle world than we would get from Harry.

Because the narrative describes people and things based on Harry's own perception of them, a Hermione-focused chapter would have likely give us insight into Hermione's view of things. It would show what she thinks of her parents and their ever-distancing relationship, or perhaps Harry and Ron are described differently in her perspective than they are from Harry's perspective, or what she thinks of muggles and her own childhood experiences in complete contrast to Harry's experiences with the Dursleys.

*TL;DR: We as readers get very little of Hermione's backstory or family in canon despite her being one of the three main characters. It stands out so much when comparing her to Harry and Ron, let alone characters like Neville and Ginny, or even someone like Fleur who appears in canon far less than Hermione.*

**** Okay, that works. Yep, my issue is that your definition of 'importance' is completely different from mine. I view what the character actually does in the series as more important than what their backstory is. Hell, I consider Hermione's lack of a dramatic backstory to be a strength of the series. Not everyone has to have a massive, impoverished family or a tragic origin. This is given weight to the idea of an 'everyman' protagonist in literature and fanfiction, especially in the realm of Self-Inserts.

This is also why I felt the comparison to Sakura was totally unfair - Hermione contributes a lot to the actual plot, and has lots of attention paid to her character development. Sakura... cuts her hair and learns medicine.

** A good writer or editor, like a good film director, needs to keep asking herself "what does this add to the story", and if it doesn't help tell the story - don't write it, or at least cut it out in a later draft.

Harry's muggle backstory? That adds a lot. Ron's magical back story? That adds a lot too. Partly it serves to explain the magical world to the reader, partly it serves to introduce a large number of characters. Hermione's muggle background, however, wouldn't add anything significant. It wouldn't help the reader understand the world, and none of her family or muggle acquaintances had any real role in the conflict so don't need introducing to the reader.

But I guess Hermione does have less emotional issues than Ron. She kind of just... gets shit done. We don't know a lot about her goals beyond “get good grades”. The only real drama in her life is her romance with Ron, and that's so poorly developed I still don't really see why she liked him. (Nothing against Ron, just their relationship).

***** Just about everything you said sounds like you're misinterpreting Mrs. Weasley's tone. Do you know why she was angry? Because her youngest sons (the oldest of which could not be more that thirteen) took an illegal, dangerous, flying car out to Surrey, which by estimation is FAR, on some half-cocked rescue attempt that nearly failed. They COULD have died! (Fallen out of the car, crashed into a building/plane, ect.) If you have children, you'll understand that this would TERRIFY any mother. It's tough love. She yells at them because she loves them, duh.

Where the hell does Molly Weasley ever say (or even imply) that Harry inconveniences her simple life??? That response is just pulling nothing out of your ass and you know it.

As for Percy, he was only a FIFTH YEAR at the time, and he was a MODEL STUDENT! Any mother would be damn proud to have a son like that and hope that her younger sons WOULD follow in his footsteps, especially if they got into the kind of trouble Fred and George got into. AND Percy actually learned that he was wrong and CAME BACK to his family in the end. It's almost like he can learn from his mistakes!

As for your next comment, I'm not entirely sure what to make of it. You seem to be trying to make a villain of Molly and Arthur. Like, they talked about it because they were getting worried because of the lack of correspondence. It's almost like they knew nothing of Harry's home life or anything that was going on because his POST WAS BEING INTERCEPTED. And this woman cares a damn lot more than many after only meeting the boy ONCE PRIOR!

Except Fred and George are much smarter and more successful than Percy later on. *And* they have their heart in the right place. They don't need to learn from their mistakes because even at 14 they know better than their grown-ass mother what is right.

Molly is just a terrible judge of character or maybe she herself doesn't really know what's right and instilled these terrible values in Percy with her terrible standards. It's probably not his fault alone that he thinks the most important thing in life is to stay in line and care about cauldron bottoms.

The good Weasleys: Bill, Charlie, Fred and George "Get me the fuck away from this woman and out of this house"

The shit Weasleys: Percy, Ron, Ginny, probably got a bit too much of the Mollywobbles love.

I just think it's funny how the height of what she aspires to when confronted with an abused/starved child is to butter him a bread.

No, what the boy needs is a buttered piece of bread.

Partly this is because of the fact that women often are given trauma as backstories (at least hers was story appropriate, here) or romance as what makes them interesting.

Let her have brown hair and brown eyes and be smart! She made her own way without being one of a huge family or super strange or lost her parents at a very young age or bitten by a monster. She's proof that you can be important and powerful without trauma or a super special backstory.

** Having a normal family and upbringing should not count as the lack of character development. Hermione is much more of a lead character/hero during the majority of pages except the climax portions. It is she who often raises the conflict or is labouring to resolve the said conflict that is the essential part of the story. And I don't buy this bs that she's a lesser character because she's too perfect or is never wrong or is the author insert. Firstly, she's the typical nerd who can't make friends and is always a little asocial. She never fits in with any one other than Harry and Ron. That too after an almost-tragedy. She's stubborn and wilful and cruel when she needs to be(her treatment of Rita and Marrieta). She's also fallible, she's wrong about Lockhart, she's wrong about the broom, she should have figured out a way to contact Sirius when Harry couldn't, she's wrong about Malfoy in HBP. She's wrong about the elves. For a fairly smart person, she's wrong about too many things. Despite all these flaws and shortcomings, she never quits. I love that about her the most. Unlike Harry and Ron, Hermione never entertains the idea of quitting or blaming other people for her losses. Imo, Hermione does not get a colourful past because her present, the here and now, is already too strong compared to other characters. If she was given more importance than she already had, the series would be needed to renamed as Hermione Granger and the Orphan Boy.

**** She's wrong about the elves mostly because she doesn't think to ask the elves what they want.

Hermione had an admirable goal there (she's absolutely right to call out house-elf slavery as exploitative bullshit) but didn't necessarily choose a good or effective way to achieve that goal, and outright ignored it when presented with evidence to suggest that her methods were offensive or hurtful to the elves she wanted to help. She was, in a way, prioritising her good *intentions* over the reality of a not particularly good *outcome*. Good intentions don't cancel out bad action or bad outcomes, and doing something to another person without their consent (as she does when she hides hats under rubbish to free elves when they pick them up) is pretty bad.

Part of that is probably just that she was fourteen. Fourteen year olds always think they're right, and for a girl like Hermione who was so used to being the smartest person in any room she entered this trait is probably even stronger. She might have mellowed and become less dogmatic later on.

But the bit we see in canon *is* something she got wrong.

Uh, the only elves that we see in anything resembling normal working conditions, yes. Winky was very well-treated and regarded until Barty Junior wound up in control and started abusing her to cover his own crimes.

Dobby was with the most abusive pureblood family we ever see, and his anomalous behavior makes it clear that most House Elves don't react that way.

He's being disruptive. It's not asking for pay - in that case, a simple 'Yes, I'm looking for a house elf and I'm willing to pay,' or 'No, sorry, can't afford that' would be fine, and wouldn't constitute high jinks by any definition. He's probably wearing garish outfits and talking about Harry with his usual enthusiasm, along with openly punishing himself out of reflex. We've seen how disruptive that can be when the Dursleys are having Vernon's client or boss or whatever over during Chamber of Secrets. Note that Ron thinks that Dobby asking for pay is unusual but clearly has no problem with it, nor does Dumbledore, meaning that in some corners of Magical Britain things are perfectly okay for a paid elf.

You'd have a point if the elves weren't openly offered pay without consequences, with proof that there were no strings attached. Unfortunately, they were. Dobby is paid by the same person who employs the other elves, and clearly comes out of it with everything he wanted. The fact that none of the other elves do the same when offered is their informed choice, having seen the proof of concept.

House elves are much more in line with the concept of vassals and retainers in older nobility. Their status and honor would be bound to the person they served, but it /would/ be considered an honor by both the retainer and society at large. Rather than receiving an explicit paycheck, their living expenses would be seen to out of their employer's pocket.

House elves, when well-treated clearly consider it an absolute honor to work for their families, and they love them. The Hogwarts elves enjoy their job and, when offered the ability to be paid for their service or given clothes in the wake of Dobby doing the same, they choose not to.

That's ridiculous. Vassals and retainers had - outside of their duties and obligations - vast amounts of personal autonomy. House Elves have none. The House Elf slavery depicted in the books is one of the most hardcore systems of slavery I can think of and yet there's people like you who want to sugarcoat it somehow. You would have been right along with the white slave owners in the 19th century who argued that this was the natural order and good for society.

Jesus, do you even remember what's been said two replies back? The house elves. At Hogwarts. Choose to remain in their current living situation. Despite having Dobby as an example of the alternative.

I do not follow. What sort of choice are you talking about?! They can not choose not to serve Hogwarts, they wouldn't find employment anywhere else. It's a disgrace to an elf.

What does refusing pay have anything to do with it? As Winky says, accepting pay and "acting out" can have serious consequences for an elf. Why would they risk that?

They aren't free, they can't make any meainingful choices. Making a choice with a gun to your head isn't a choice. You are arguing like a Mafia boss: "Would be a shame if something were to happen to your fine establishment. But it's your choice!!!"

When Winky says that about Dobby, she's referring to his weirdly garish clothing and aberrant behavior (he still reflexively punishes himself whenever he does something the Malfoys wouldn't like, and talks up Harry like he's the Messiah).

They are offered pay while continuing on as Hogwarts house elves, the same as Dobby. They refuse. They can *see* Dobby in the same arrangement, perfectly happy. They still refuse.

There are no consequences. No thugs breaking their legs, no 'serious consequences from the Ministry,' Dumbledore, or any other wizard.

I honestly think the part where you said you wouldn't respect their choice if it went against what you thought was best for them demonstrated pretty clearly that you're the one with the problem understanding choices.

#+begin_quote
  Having a normal family and upbringing should not count as the lack of character development
#+end_quote

I never said that a normal family and upbringing was a lack of character development. On the contrary, I think Hermione's lack of character development is entirely because we never explore Hermione's family and upbringing whatsoever. All we got of Hermione's family was one comic-relief scene in CoS and then they faded into non-existence for the rest of the series.

Harry's story had stakes because he was the main character. His parents were killed by Voldemort, and he was considered the chosen one by the prophecy. Harry was Voldemort's primary target above everyone else. Ron's story had stakes because Voldemort could have very easily had his family wiped out. One of the main themes of DH for him was how he felt his family was in danger while he was off with the Trio, given that Ginny was under the DE-led Hogwarts and the rest of his family were being monitored by the Ministry.

But for Hermione? We don't really know her parents other than knowing they exist. There is no true stakes for her since if her parents were murdered while she was at Hogwarts, there would be zero emotional impact since we, the reader, never knew her parents. Sure, as a muggleborn she is directly impacted by the actions of the Death Eaters, but literally everyone on Harry/Dumbledore's side was at risk of being targeted by Death Eaters. No matter what her blood status was, she was always going to be personally at risk by her close association with Harry, albeit not to the same extent as the Weasleys (given the context of the First Wizarding War coupled with the Malfoys' view of them).

My problem wth Hermione's backstory is that, as one of the three main characters, she is expected to have a backstory with similar depths as both Harry and Ron. In reality, her backstory is shallow and overshadowed by not just Harry and Ron's backstory, but also by those of Ginny, Neville, and Luna.

There is a reason that people began to enjoy Snape as a character around OotP and HBP, and it wasn't entirely due to Alan Rickman. It was because OotP and HBP (and to a far lesser extent, so did PoA) fleshed out his character beyond "horrible teacher who hates Harry". Snape's past being explored in OotP fleshed out his character and made him a bit more relatable to the reader than he was in say, CoS. *Imagine how bland and pathetic of a character Snape would have been if we never got to see his childhood in OotP and DH, or if we never knew that the Marauders bullied him or that he had an unrequited love for Lily. Imagine if we knew as much about Snape in DH as we did in the very first book. He would have just been a very dislikeable character with basically zero redeeming or relatable qualities.* Exploring his backstory not only made him a more relatable character, it objectively made him a better character compared to how he was in the first two books. If Hermione's backstory was explored more in regards to her parents, how she views the muggle world, and how she was treated by muggle kids before she got her Hogwarts letter, she certainly would have been a better and relatable character than she ever was.

*TL;DR: Having a normal family is not "lack of character development". Having a normal family that only appears in like two pages of the entire series for comic-relief is "lack of character development". We know as much about Hermione's family and her backstory in DH as we did during CoS.*

** To reiterate what others said in this thread, backstory isn't everything and you could make a fully fleshed out character through just viewing their interactions with the story.

She has a very clear arc of going from an isolated nerdy and sometimes judgmental kid to being an exceptionally driven person with strong relationships and increased empathy. This arc is so well done in fact that even though she changes throughout the books her core identity is still there which is a search for knowledge and an understanding of justice.

Her struggles, her growth, and her interactions really formed her into a believable person without the aid of a backstory so at least I wouldn't consoder that bad writing

** Interesting points. I don't fully agree but do feel that JKR dropped the ball by not showing any positive muggle familial or even, mentioned, external supporting characters or positive influences to her muggleborn characters. With the result that, in a series that strongly claims muggles are just as good as wizards and people shouldn't be prejudiced, the only muggle characters we see are 1 or more of: ignorant, baffled and confused by the magical world, actively vile and abusive. With the reveal of the odd but nice Mrs Figg as part of the wizarding community, literally the only positively-portrayed muggle characters are Hermione's parents, who aren't even named and who appear (iirc) for a single scene across seven books.

Neither Harry nor Ron would be able to relate to much of any of Hermione's “backstory”.

And Harry's own backstory was so socially repressed he wouldn't have even know the questions to ask, so we the readers, never get them looked into.

I get your frustration, and I agree that I would have liked to know more than the glossing over we got, but I can see why it would get edited out. I think others share that sentiment, which is why there is a-lot of in depth Hermione centric fiction.

Now, consider this problem through the eyes of J.K Rowling.\\
You have a character who is going to end up moving into a magical world. She will fall in love with Ron who's family mostly ignored the squib accountant as well as generally ignorant about Muggles. Hermione herself will mostly spend her summers with Weasleys. Because that's where the plot will occur.\\
So, you wouldn't focus on characters who wouldn't be significant to the plot.

Personally, I don't think Hermione had a very meaningful connection with her parents. As in, we never see her ponder that she was starting to spend less and less time with her family. Maybe all muggleborns have to desert their family if they're going to live as magicals.

I'm well aware that Hermione outclasses those three in terms of usefulness. She's the best student in her year and one of the main reasons Harry and Ron didn't get themselves killed by Death Eaters (especially in DH).

However as another user said, Hermione has no desires or dreams. We know Harry wants to stop Voldemort and belong in the wizarding world, since he doesn't really belong in the muggle world he grew up in. We know Ron is overshadowed by his entire family and feels like the least favourite child, and how much he wants to become his own person who isn't just "another Weasley". But what exactly does Hermione want? Since Hermione's only defining traits are being the only girl in the main trio, being the only muggleborn in the main trio, and being very smart. As one of the main character, she shouldn't be that bland. Minor side characters (e.g. Pansy Parkinson, Terry Boot, Dawlish, etc) are allowed to be bland and simple because nobody really expects them to be that important anyway.

Compared to Harry and Ron's fleshed out characters and desires, Hermione feels like a third-wheel with zero desires and zero motivations. A character purpose and role in a story should be more than just "being smart for plot convenience" (i.e. Hermione). The closest she gets to having desires and wants of her own is when she made S.P.E.W... which she not only forgot about after GoF, but the entire S.P.E.W arguably weakened her character by having her ignore the wishes of the House Elves to push her own agenda (effectively implying that she thinks the opinions of a human witch are more valuable and superior than the opinions of mere House Elves).

I think Hermione would have been more likeable if she actively tried to get involved in politics within the wizarding world early and more often. It would have been great setup for Hermione's goal to become a politician so she could use her influence within the Ministry to speak for the voiceless in the magical world. Sure, Rowling had her become Minister for Magic in Cursed Child (the questionable canon of that play, aside), but her joining the Ministry was basically because she (along with Harry and Ron) needed to help Kingsley reform the Ministry following the events of DH. The fact that she became Minister would have been a bonus for her, but not really the reason she worked for the Ministry originally. I think it would have been interesting if Hermione ended up as Minister for Magic at some point prior to the Epilogue of DH, rather than in Cursed Child.

*TL;DR: Hermione really needed desires and goals of her own, especially early on. Having her goal be to become Minister for Magic would have made her seem more fleshed out since it could have allowed the exploration of topics that a Harry-centric narrative would otherwise gloss over due to Harry's ignorance and apathy towards said topics.*

*** When I say Hermione was the best in their year, I'm mainly referring to the fact she got an Outstanding on all of her O.W.L subjects except for DADA. Its pretty hard to one-up getting nine Outstandings and one Exceeds Expectations.

Its more about how Hermione was portrayed compared to other students in Harry's year. Not once are we shown a single student who does comparable to Hermione in their year across the board. Sure, Harry is much better than Hermione at DADA and Neville is presumably better than her at Herbology but across the board, she's presented as being the best in their year.

Between making Polyjuice Potion in her second year, learning the Summoning Charm months several months before Harry, using the NEWT-level Protean Charm in her fifth year, and basically everything she did in DH, there just isn't anyone else in Harry's year that could be considered equal or better to Hermione all-around. Its not just that Hermione gets high marks, but that she is consistently shown to be ahead of her peers in all her subjects (unlike, say, Neville who is only good at Herbology, or to a lesser extent, Harry, who only notable skills are DADA and Quidditch).

However, I must stress that *Harry's year only having one noteworthy student is seemingly an outlier if the Marauders generation are anything to go by.* Yes, James and Sirius were the best in their year, but at least they had competition who did comparable to some extent. Lily, while not as good as James and Sirius, was regarded as being very talented, as was Lupin to a lesser extent. Not to mention Snape, who was even more skilled than Lily. *Hermione, as skilled as she was, was far inferior to James, Sirius, Snape, and Lily were at her age*

The problem with Hermione is that she never had the desire to innovate the same way other genius witches and wizards have done. She learns faster than her peers, but she just learns from the textbook, a flaw Snape called her out on at least twice. She always lacked the desire to experiment and innovate with magic. Even one of her best feats, the Protean Charm, is impressive because its NEWT-level magic done in fifth year. But the act of using the Protean Charm on the DA Coins is merely using the charm for the purpose it was intended for: magically linking objects together.

*TL;DR: Talent-wise, Hermione is a medium fish in small pond. James, Sirius, Snape, and Lily all vastly outclass Hermione in every way. Aside from Hermione, the students in Harry's year aren't really that good at magic across the board, and are only really shown to be good at one subject and then being average or below average in every other subject.*

** I completely agree that Hermione's backstory should have been filled in a bit more, even just a POV chapter of her and her parents, perhaps as she's saying her goodbyes and getting picked up by the Order?

I feel this lack of backstory filling exposition could tie into how Rowling kinda...glossed over things as she was writing and instead of thinking through how things made sense from what she's actually written, she went with her 'master plan' on the back of napkins in a shoebox from when she started writing the series in the 90's. Like, Harry and Hermione being insistent that they think of each other as siblings, and somehow unlike every other teenager are incapable of entertaining the idea of any of all their friends as an eligible partner for a second. That makes a lot more sense having heard about how in the early drafts it was the Grangers that found Harry and raised him, because they'd have basically grown up as brother and sister. But that plotline was thrown aside because it makes little sense to just raise whatever baby you find, the likelyhood of the people who find & raise the BWL being muggles but having a witch as a daughter is extremely low(but who knows, maybe Harry'd have infected Hermione with his unnaturalness like the Dursleys theorized all along!), and there'd be no Dursleyesque antagonism at home to inspire the protagonist to jump wholeheartedly into the magical world without looking back if Harry's homelife had been happy, and if it wasn't happy then there wouldn't be any examples at all of muggles raising wizarding children well, which kinda makes the Death Eaters right.

Besides, it's more fulfilling for Hermione to have her own independent journey into the wizarding world before becoming friends with Harry & Ron, as opposed to just being Harry's obnoxious older sister. But I do wish Rowling had done -something- to include the Grangers. Maybe have the trio regroup at their house after the Weasley wedding fiasco, drawn the DEs in with their flippant use of Voldemort's name, thus giving Hermione a much better excuse to force her parent's hand and send them to the opposite side of the globe.

These are not real flaws when they're shown to be justified.

As about her being narrow-minded, we all know she's not. Throughout the series, she showed that she's quite open-minded, sometimes even more than Ron and Harry. Just because she didn't take the Deathly Hallows seriously, it doesn't mean she's narrow minded.

She wasn't just stubborn with the Half-Blood Prince's book; she was stubborn throughout the entire series.

And a narrow-minded Hermione (which she is) didn't simply take the Deathly Hallows seriously, she doubted the existence of them. Also, her and Luna's disagreement/argument in Order of the Phoenix if heliopaths exist shouldn't be overlooked either.

Edit: And she wasn't always portrayed as right. A prime example being she thought the Half-Blood Prince's text was akin to that of Tom Riddle's diary. While some curses in the book were harmful, it turned out to be just a potion's textbook with Snape's adjustments. Also, the book actually helped Harry on several occasions (winning Felix Felicis and thus obtaining Slughorn's memory of horcruxes, and savings Ron's life when he was poisoned) instead of trying to kill Harry like Riddle's diary did.

Still ending up with Ron when she tended to belittle him throughout their school years? Or how about not getting detention or a prison sentence for not only causing permanent injury to another student but also causing a government official to be kidnapped by hostile forces?

*** You just made me doubt we read the same book. Hermione is the girl no one wanted to be friends with until fate brought her close to Harry and Ron, so they can perceive her best qualities? Hermione is bossy and knows what's best for everyone, teacher's pet and rigid rule follower, kinda self-righteous (even hypocritically sometimes), generally unwilling to admit she is wrong when she is wrong, rude to people she thinks are wrong and often insensitive to people's emotions (poor Lavender's bunny). I can provide examples, but I am sure people know what I am talking about. She pays for it by being rather unpopular and constantly having conflicts.

The thing is those qualities are kinda balanced by the fact that she is meant to be more intelligent than most people. The way you portray it, aside from giving her random trivia bits and good grades is to have her be able to see and deduct things others can't, i.e. be right. That's why she is rarely actually wrong, otherwise her character would be pretty unbearable, imo.

I wish they'd shown her parents as an example of good muggles, to counter Dursleys. But I see how they might have been out of the scope of the plot. Hermione is pretty fleshed out character as it is.

** Hermione's parents are in a rather toxic relationship Hermione doesn't like to talk about. They don't beat each other, but they should have divorced long ago. Hermione grew watching them quarrel and inflict mental harm to one another - that's why she grows to be a bit of a sociopath (ask Marietta!).

Anyway, McGonnagal had quite a bit of work (and maybe a few confundus charms) in convincing Hermione's parents to send her to Hogwarts (how many parents would trust their children to a stranger who will take them for months to a school they can't even see, it's outside muggle law and where they have no control?). Hermione, like Harry, saw Hogwarts as the opportunity to leave a troublesome home and, since she was given the letter almost a year before she could attend, put an initial effort in learning magic to impress her parents and make sure they'll send her. Make no mistake, Hermione loves her parents, but the three of them have a bit of a strained relationship, between their fights, magic and Hermione's puberty (and it's emotional baggage)

Since she was often at Diagon Alley before going to Hogwarts (she lives in London, right? She only needs to take the tube to the Leaky Cauldron), she quickly understood she would be seen as a second class citizen and, powered with a thirst for knowledge, worked hard to become an overachiever. Just like Harry, the Hat wanted to put her in Slytherin at first, but declined because it knew how hard it would be for her there. Unlike popular opinion, the Hat's second choice was Hufflepuff, but she ended up in Gryffindor anyway.

She was never able to bond with Lavander and the Parvatti twin because of her unspoken emotional issues, which only become worse until the troll incident.

Anyway, she built a house of cards of lies after book 2 to explain her parents why she was out of touch for so long (when she was petrified), but it held. By book four, she got into a relationship with Krum and even though they had regular sex, she was torn between her crush on Viktor and the nagging feeling in the back of her head remembering her about her nascent feelings for Ron. She hesitated to take on Krum's offer to go to Bulgaria because of that. Also, would she explain that to her parents?

Things turned a turn for the worse when she arrived to King's Cross. While they were waiting for her on the muggle side of the station, Hermione's parents overheard wizards talk about Cedric's death. Her house of cards fell during the trip back to (her parents) home, even her very edited version didn't hold up to scrutiny and their parents took the rational choice of pulling her out of Hogwarts and enrolling her in whatever options she had as a British teenager who had been absent from school since the age of twelve.

An emotional train-wreck, Hermione abandoned her home that very night, grabbing her stuff and taking the Knight Bus to the Burrow. By chance, she met Albus Dumbledore there, who was about to meet Molly and Arthur about relocating to Grimmauld Place. In hera nervous collapse, she spoke her hearth to Dumbledore. The old man, understanding how valuable Hermione was in the fight against Voldemort (as a prop for Harry, but valuable nonetheless), made a bit of a deal with her. She would of course be going back to Hogwarts, on a scholarship if needed, and he'd arrange to have her live either at the Burrow or at Grimmauld Place. In return, he asked her for her trust - that's the reason why Hermione didn't contact Harry over the summer, despite desperately wanting to do it. She kept all this from Harry in part because of shame and in part because Dumbledore told her he feared Harry would imitate her and leave Private Drive if he knew, and Dumbledore insisted it was important for Harry to spend some time there.

She tried to rekindle her relationship with her parents through the school year. By Christmas, she wasn't with them, she was with Krum but the relationship wasn't working out. Through the rest of books 5 and 6, she managed to get into a polite distance relationship with her parents, but never returned to live with them. She didn't put a memory charm on them (she had never done one before the fight at the cafe) but an Imperious curse to convince them they were the Wilkins and were happily married. If she died, the curse would lift by itself. If Voldemort was defeated, she'd lift it. Distance matters in Australia. They didn't go France, they went to Majorca - she said Australia just in case Harry or Ron were captured and interrogated. The "Wilkins" marriage failed, just like the Grangers did, because she only gave them general directions with the curse. She didn't tell Harry and Ron just in case they'd try to imitate her and because she knew how wrong her actions were (maiming Marietta is ok. But the books say the Imperious is Unforgivable!).

After book 7, she remotely lifted the curse and restarted contact with her parents, but the relationship between the three of them was permanently damaged. They love each other, but the pain and betrayals are just too much. They can't trust each other again.

**************** *Basilisk*

In European bestiaries and legends, a basilisk ( or , from the Greek βασιλίσκος basilískos, "little king"; Latin regulus) is a legendary reptile reputed to be a serpent king who can cause death with a single glance. According to the Naturalis Historia of Pliny the Elder, the basilisk of Cyrene is a small snake, "being not more than twelve fingers in length", that is so venomous, it leaves a wide trail of deadly venom in its wake, and its gaze is likewise lethal. Its weakness is the odor of the weasel, which, according to Pliny, was thrown into the basilisk's hole, recognizable because some of the surrounding shrubs and grass had been scorched by its presence. It is possible that the legend of the basilisk and its association with the weasel in Europe was inspired by accounts of certain species of Asiatic snakes (such as the king cobra) and their natural predator, the mongoose.
