I have read a lot of time travel fics where someone from the future (ex. Harry, Sirius, Hermione, etc... ) to the past and tries to fix things. I'm curious if there are any fics where someone from the past traveled to the future. All the memory they have was only up to the point when they left their time period. Preferably, any character from the the Marauders' Era or Grindelwald's Era before or after (I'm curious if their are any fics where young Dumbledore meets his older self, if there are any...)

An example that I can thinking of is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10627003/1/Tempting-Fate][Tempting Fate]] by GoldenFinches. It is not necessarily a time travel fic, but Regulus is brought back to life with only memories up to his death. linkffn(10627003)

I am also cool if there is a fic where young Harry meets older Harry too or any characters really meeting their older selves in the future.

Edit: I prefer non-bashing stories.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5725656/1/Fate-s-Favourite][Fate's Favourite]] comes to mind.

  You always get the stories where Harry goes back into Tom Riddle's time, then either stays or gets sent back. End of, unless he tries to make Voldemort good. But what if things went differently? What if, just once, someone followed a time traveller back?
