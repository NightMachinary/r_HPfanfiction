"My father told about you Weasleys," Draco snarls in an attempt to sound like his father. "Red hair, doesn't know the first thing about manners." Taking a good look at his fellow first year Draco raised an eyebrow, "You're robes are nicer than I thought they would be. Did your father finally manage to stop playing with muggles and do something useful?"

The redhead was shocked silent at the tirade Draco issued forth, and looking at Crabbe and Goyle as they attempted to be intimidating as their fathers taught them was truly a sight to behold. Taking a moment to gather himself the redhead stood up just a little straighter and spoke with an air of forced haughtiness. "I don't know any Weasleys. My name is Prince Henry Charles Albert David. Son of Prince Charles and Princess Diana of Wales, and Third in line to inherit the throne of England." Losing the tone of false haughtiness the prince grinned, "But please, call me Harry.

//////

I know I'm messing with the dates a little bit but a comment interaction where someone mentioned the fact that Prince Harry was a redhead just inspired this short little blurb.

And it was a really cool thought to be like "What if Prince Harry was a Muggleborn?"

Feel free to take this idea and run with it!

"Perhaps, but I've been reading about the greatest witches and wizards and plenty have been described as muggleborn. Whatever that might mean. Take for instance Agathe the Arrogant? In 1132, it's said that she invented vertiserum."

"Stupid dumb luck is all!"

Upon hearing the common a crowd gathers. "It's Prince Harry," a voice exclaims.

The Prince turns around and with an laugh asks, "and you are?"

"Hermione Granger. It's an honour. And don't mind Draco, he has a wild imagination of what a wizard should be."

"When my father hears about this...." Draco seethes.

"He'll what, Malfoy? Prince Harry is third in line to the throne? What can he do?" Harry drawls. "You know we're tiny insects compared to him? I'm sure your father could be put in Azkaban for life for even thinking about harming the Prince."
