Saw this in [[/r/books][r/books]] and really want to share this with you :)

On a magical railroad, cool wind in my hair

Warm smell of butterbeer, rising up through the air

Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light

My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim I had to stop for the night

::

There she stood at the gateway

I heard the classroom bell

And I was thinking to myself

'This could be heaven or this could be Hell

Then she boldly said "Lumos" and she showed me the way

There were voices down the corridor

I thought I heard them say

::

Welcome to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft

Such a wondrous place (such a wondrous place)

Living painting face

Sketchy AF rooms at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft

Any time of year (Any time of year), look at Hagrid's beard

::

Her mind is Imperio-twisted, she got the Crucio bends

She got a lot of magic wizard boys, that she calls friends

How they duel in the Chamber, where it is wet

Some duel and find big snakes, some duel and forget

::

So I called up the Captain

"Please bring me the snitch"

He said, "we haven't caught that golden ball since the last game of quiddich"

And still those voices are calling from far away

Wake you up in the middle of the night

Just to hear them say:

::

Welcome to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft

Such a wondrous place (such a wondrous place)

Living painting face

Centaurs in the woods at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft

Fuck you, Prof. Umbridge (fuck you Prof. Umbridge), you were such a bitch

::

NSA-style mapping

The drinks come from thin air

And she said, 'we are all just magical here, so who really cares

And in the Great dining hall

They gathered for the feast

They shoot it with their magic wands

But they just can't kill the beast

::

Last thing I remember, I was

Running for the door

I had to find the passage back to the place I was before

"Relax" said big Hagrid

"We--"

"TROLL! TROLL IN THE DUNGEON!"


** Ahahaha thank you!
