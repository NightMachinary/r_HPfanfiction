Why do so many fics specify that the males wear boxers? Are they that much more prevalent in the UK? (It's roughly 50-50 in the US.) There are so many other terms that are ambiguous as to the type of underthings: pants, smalls, shorts, drawers... (I'm assuming "knickers" is the same as "panties" in that it usually refers to female undergarments.) So why, in fics where it is specified, is it ALWAYS boxers?

Boxer shorts weren't even created until 1925, with jockey shorts appearing 10 years after that. With the separation of the two worlds, why would purblood wizards even know either exist? At most they'd be wearing braies. And, as we know, many older wizards "go commando" under their robes by tradition, for that "healthy breeze 'round their privates."

Granted, this question is fueled by my strong dislike of boxers (not that it's really my place to say, being female, but I'm glad my SO prefers briefs as I do).

-----

ETA: Just found some 2018 statistics that shows my 50-50 information is out of date. Boxers only approach half the market if you include boxer briefs, to which I have no aversion. The other half is a combination of trunks and briefs. Interesting that boxer briefs and trunks, both in the "in-between" category, are both more popular than either boxers or briefs, each of which have smaller than 25% market share. I'm not sure that is an indication of number of wearers of boxers versus briefs; boxers have a wider range of designs and patterns, so those who prefer boxers may purchase more per capita. But this is all really more scientific than I intended my question to be.

** Only about 25% of the UK male population wears briefs. That figure masks age distribution, however - briefs are overwhelmingly worn by old men and associated with that age range. Grab a random set of 100 20-year-old guys and I'm fairly confident none of them would be wearing briefs.

** I'm from the UK and I've never ever, not even once, been with a guy who wears Y-fronts or briefs. 100% of the guys I've either been getting it on with or have seen in their underwear (like mates getting changed) have worn boxers. Some guys have specific underwear for sports, but would wear boxers generally day to day. Briefs in the UK are associated with old men and pre pubescent boys, not teenagers or adult (working age) men.

**** It's like briefs, usually white, and the way the material is stitched it makes the front look like a Y as there is a sort of fold like in boxers or trunks to get the willy out to pee.

Synonymous with dirty old men.

(Actually I didn't so I had to google “y front dirty old men” and oddly enough Danny Glover popped out in the reaults.)

This has been eye-opening. Thank you.

** I don't know. It may have something to do with the classic, golden era cartoon image of someone getting hurt and bam, boxers are shown. It's a staple of kid's cartoon and comedy that the baddest of bad guys normally wear heart printed boxers. An easy assumption to make.

That said the only time I was ever bothered by this was when Krum was described as wearing them. I've done enough sport to know that most sports of the sort (in this case I'm comparing it to equestrian, stock cars and above all cyclism) are done without any pants (or underpants if you're american)...

Though that is a good question. Guess they don't quite get the padding.

*** Yeah, jockeys and the like don't wear underwear because the padded stuff is built into their silks. But that doesn't mean they don't wear boxers in their day to day life when they're wearing regular clothes, so why wouldn't Krum wear boxers under his school uniform or regular clothes even if he wears something similar to jockeys silks whilst training or competing?

Unless of course the fic had him specifically wearing them under his quidditch gear, then I see your point, no one of any gender would want to sit on a stick for hours with nothing to protect their "area"...

**** Pants in british english means underwear.

If you're cycling long distances or for a period much longer than 90 minutes then yes. I absolutely hope you're not wearing underwear under your padded shorts.

Unless it was a joke and if so I'm sorry. Bad at picking those up.

***** I cycle about an hour to work in the morning and an hour back (when not in lockdown, obviously), and I just wear pants and leggings... other than the foam in the saddle, no extra padding.

Seriously beginning to think I'm doing something very wrong!

****** As I said, this is for road racing and sport. Cycling to and from work at a moderate pace is completely different from road racing at high speeds. I see no problem with just wearing whatever if you're not intending to ride professionally.

Heck, when I know I'm not in a rush and go at 15-20km an hour through the city, I often wear jeans. It's more of a precaution for intensive road racing style riding. Sorry if I made you feel otherwise.

******* It's about 11 miles each way, but I'm not very fast, only recently started doing it, and can't wait to get back to it once lockdown is over!

Also makes me think how much I'd love to commute by broomstick - more direct, and less chance of falling into a canal!

Broomsticks as bikes also makes me think how people who aren't really great at team sports, so couldn't play Quidditch (or like me probably just wouldn't be good enough to make the team!) could instead do the equivalent of downhill racing - set routes through trees, slalom, etc!

** Why do wizards have any muggle inspired stuff?

Very Short: It was written by muggles

Short: It's very possible that wizards took to boxers via muggleborns. And boxers are the perfect ratio of "the freeing of the rod and tackle" and social acceptability.

Most people would consider boxer briefs as a subset of boxers if it came down to it, as far as I'm aware.
