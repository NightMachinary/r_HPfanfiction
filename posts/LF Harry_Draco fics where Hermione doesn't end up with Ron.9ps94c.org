I've been browsing AO3 for a bit and in most of the HPDM fics I've seen, especially the long ones, Hermione ends up with Ron. Which... I mean I know that it's canon and all but I just can't with that ship, you know?

I've shipped SSHG since I fourteen and GoF came out (eighteen years, my god I feel old) and by this time if I try to read her with anyone else my brain just wants to call her a filthy cheater and flounce off.

So all in all, I'd prefer HPDM stories where Hermione ends up with Snape or nobody, but with the focus definitely on the Potter/Malfoy relationship.

If Snape and Harry end up having a mentor-type or at least decent relationship, that would also be great.

Tl:DR: Looking for HPDM fics with no HGRW, lots of Snape, and SSHG optional as long as Hermione doesn't end up with someone else. The longer the better and I like slow burn.
