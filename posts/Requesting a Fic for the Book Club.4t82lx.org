I just finished "Ghost of You." I really want to discuss it and know there is a Book Club thread. Is this the appropriate way to recommend it for discussion. Otherwise, if anyone cares to discuss in this thread, if that's ok, I'd love to.


** The first few chapters always get me so goddamn teary. I'm actually re reading it now and although Ginny can get long winded and whiny every now and then it's such a powerful fic. blacktag189 does not take shortcuts with her healing.

Really loved it.

  "He spotted Ginny two tables away; she was sitting with her head on her mother's shoulder: There would be time to talk later, hours and days and maybe years in which to talk." -- DH pg. 745. He didn't think it would be that easy...did he? **Completed**
