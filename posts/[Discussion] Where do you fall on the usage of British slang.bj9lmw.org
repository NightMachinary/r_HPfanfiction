When you're writing, do you use "snog" instead of "kiss"? "arse" instead of "ass", or "loo" instead of "bathroom"?

Or if you're reading a fic, does it bother you if an author decides to forgo those terms?


** Snogging is more than kissing. The american equivalent would be "making out", I think

** When I'm writing, I try to use the British slang and spelling because I feel it matches closer to the source material. When I'm reading, I don't really mind, but if there's a word that I know to be of a different cultural origin that wouldn't normally be in the Harry Potter universe, then I start to get a bit peeved and will probably drop it.

*** I don't particularly like a lot of British slang, but in my opinion, if you're writing from the perspective of a character that would likely think in those terms, then you should use it.

And if it's actual dialogue, then you should absolutely use it.

**** I totally agree with the perspective/dialogue point. Sometimes, as an American reading some of those ridiculous British spellings of words, it can detract a little, but... I don't know, just feels like I owe it to Rowling. She's letting us all play around with her world a bit (She hasn't revoked that right yet) and as homage, I use some silly spellings and words.

** Actually understanding the vernacular is key.

Snog isn't a direct replacement for kiss, it means making out.

Arse is used instead of ass.

Loo is used instead of bathroom, but lavatory or simply toilet see equal or increased usage depending on the formality.

I really have no problem reading a fic based on American English, so long as they don't have a half-arsed attempt at seeming British.

** When I'm reading a Harry Potter fic I like to see British turns of phrase, but it's not essential.

I'll only get annoyed if the British characters in the fic frequently use American curse words. To me that seems like laziness and poor taste when the author could have easily spent a little time either brit-picking or making up wizarding world equivalents that would be more in-character. The cursing doesn't make me instantly drop a fic, but usually that sort of fic has other quality issues that make me stop reading it.

****** Yes, but other swear words are more common than those two in Britain ("bloody", "twat", etc.) In my opinion it's out of character for British students to use those two words exclusively without a sprinkling of the more common British swears that would fit better in context. The limited slang vernacular makes them sound like Americans.

****** Both "fuck" and "bitch" are pretty commonly used in the UK, but I think the quickest thing in regards to swearing that denotes an American author is the significant lack of "cunt." It seems to have sexist connotations for many people in the US while in the UK it's almost the go-to swear.

******** In the UK we don't use blocks because almost none of our cities are based on grids. I think Terry Pratchett once wrote how most cities evolve around the paths that cows used to take down to the river, which is probably a bit of an exaggeration but at least plausible.

If you look at a map of, say, New York, you can see easily identifiable blocks of buildings divided by roads in pretty much a grid. Now look at central London. It's all over the place - and this is a city that had its centre cleared out 350 years ago thanks to the great fire.

So while the idea of "three city blocks" might make sense in an American context, it makes none in a UK context.

yes, this point especially. "Harry walked the rest of the way as it was only four blocks." makes no sense, either use miles or how long it takes to walk or travel somewhere.

It is also rarely a straight path to drive or walk somewhere , especially getting around in London if you are not a regular in the area, should lead to the character being lost once in a while. My uncle, who has been living in London for nearly 40 years, still occasionally gets lost because paths change. He explained it to me once as "London is alive, sometimes a street you have been walking down for years will suddenly be blocked and you have to find a new way". This offers many great writing opportunities especially in a magical world.

The other measure of distance which seems to fox friends from across the pond is “as the crow flies” e.g. “oh it's only ten miles as the crow flies but it's a 40 minute drive”

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_path][Desire paths]] are a real thing and it's totally plausible that streets in old cities like London were just a formalization of said paths.

** It's important to realise that there's a lot more to British slang than meets the eye. Each region has its own words for various things. Sometimes these words are used over quite a wide area while sometimes it's a village-only term that baffles anyone from over 20 miles away.

As someone born and bred in the northwest of England I use the term "ginnel" for what most people here would call an "alley". There was a thread on swearing recently where we agreed the word "pillock" is a more northern term too.

There's also a class thing going on too, although that's becoming less true these days. Fifty years ago someone trying to be seen as upper class wouldn't ever have used a term as vulgar as "lavatory", let alone "loo". It was "cloakroom" or "water closet" if they had to.

In Harry Potter terms it means that there are going to be big differences between the way Draco, Neville, Harry and Seamus (to pick four names almost at random) speak.

Realistically though, it's not worth putting that level of detail into a fanfic, where most people are going to ignore the effort you put into realistic portrayals of characters' upbringings in favour of asking who's going to be paired with whom.

You should put in some, though. I'll agree that your example would be overkill, but I remember seeing in one story Augusta Longbottom saying something like, "You kids go have fun." I think something along the lines of, "You children run along and amuse yourselves" would have been more in character.

** As a reader, I find it very jarring when there's lots of Americanisms; a few is fine, as an Australian there's definite use of both American and British slang terms, so I imagine there's some similar absorption into British common use. But there's one thing that drives me literally up the wall. Biscuits are what you would call a cookie. Do not. Ever. (Unless it's an American character in the scene or a deliberate move on your partpartly whatever reason) have a non American eating whatever 'biscuits' are in AmericaLand for breakfast. Especially if you're going to have a character eat a 'full English breakfast', because just no. I apologise for the rant but oh my god it drives me insane...

If you can't roll it up without breaking it, it's not a pancake. And while you can presumably have fruit as a filling, I've never heard of anyone putting anything other than batter in the batter.

Also, I'm seriously salty over the lack of Shrove Tuesday in fics. It's theoretically a christian religious thing but mostly it's 'the day you eat pancakes'.
