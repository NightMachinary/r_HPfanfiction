Looking for fics where Harry travels to an AU that has another Harry(or Harry equivalent) already there, preferably alive and well.

Bonus points if they interact at some point.

I haven't seen too many that do this, but I'll list the 3 I can think of so you get an idea of what I mean.

On a Pale Horse by Hyliian\\
Imprisoned Realm by Hermioneluv\\
0800-Rent-A-Hero by brainthief

Ideally want a gen fic.

Thanks!


** I'm very slowly writing one with a friend where canon Harry (mostly) accidentally ends up in a world with a fem!Harry. We havent posted any of it yet though but have like 25k words written so far. I guess this is sort of pointless to mention, lol, but we might start posting soon.

**** Dont want to give too much but basically Harry has an accident while chasing Bellatrix through the Department of Mysteries after she has just killed Sirius. That accident sends Harry to an alternate universe. He doesnt even realize at first and tries to continue following her to the atrium only to stumble upon Voldemort arriving to confront fem!Harry. Lily Potter is also alive in this world, Sirius never went to jail because of it and had a daughter of his own. Bunch other differences as well and lots of similarities too. :)

*** Well that sounds better than about 99.9% of Harry meets fem!Harry stories. As long a it's well written I'd prolly read it. Idc if you ship them or not the story sounds interesting from what I saw in the comments regardless. As long as there's no 25 year old harry for some reason wants to fuck his 14 year old alternate self. I couldn't get through more than 1 or 2 chapters in other stories in the trope.

** It's seriously angsty and the updates are few and far between (but still happening), but I really like /Too Far From Home/ linkffn(5757945).

It has canon Harry sent by canon Voldemort (still hasn't been revealed just why) to an AU that's five years ahead of his own timeline (and very different). Has a 19 year old Harry, it's own Voldemort, and the full cast of characters. Again, really angsty, but it stuck with me and there are some interesting and unexpected plot twists. Gen fic.

  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

  “Welcome to the first Interdimensional Harry Potter Meeting!” Harry wakes to find himself surrounded by seven other, very different Harry Potters. He's about to learn more about himself than he ever wanted to know. Premise: I've read many stories in which Harry's life takes a turn at some point along the way and he becomes a completely different kind of person. This story explores several of those while focusing on Harry as he was in canon at the culmination of the 1st book. What if JK's Harry Potter were to discover prior to 2nd year exactly what his own potential could truly be? What if he had found unconditional acceptance and support to guide him on paths he'd never imagined? What if, at the tender age of 12, he had discovered unrestricted access to a deep well of information Dumbledore had never meant for him to have? I give you The Harry Potter Self-Help Group...WARNING: This is a Work In Progress. It is not finished, nor may it ever be finished. It is presently at around 35,000 words. I will post what I have written and add more if/when I write it. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. But this is nothing to what awaits him in the future. A future that he will do anything to protect.

  In the aftermath of the Second Blood War its horrors still haunt the survivors, the country needs to be rebuilt and the last thing Harry Potter needed was a family of Potters from another dimension suddenly appearing.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

**** Thanks for the recommendations.

I've read I'm Still Here, C'est La Vie, and The Merging already.\\
The others look interesting though, Strange Reflections in particular.

Thank you!

  Voldemort is back, he can be stopped but all things come at a price. Someone called for a hero but he said no, ripped from his own reality he jumps again. Will he be more helpful this time? AU femHarry.

  A trap during the Horcrux hunt sends Harry into a dimension where war has raged for 28 years. Harry must not only protect himself from Voldemort, but also from a rising new Dark Lord, the evil Ministry, a war-hardened Dumbledore... and himself. Will he find his way back home to finish his own war?
