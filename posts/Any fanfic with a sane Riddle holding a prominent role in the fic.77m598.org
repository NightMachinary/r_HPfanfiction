He could be the protagonist but he doesn't have to be. I'm just looking for any fic that has a sane Tom Riddle Jr. in the story playing a significant enough of a role in the story that affects and moves the plot but doesn't have to revolve around him.

Something about a sane Riddle makes me happy lol any method of producing said sane Riddle is fine by me! +Just no angsty teenage things please, I think I've experienced enough of angst haha!+ or angst is fine as long as it's written enjoyably well I guess!


** linkffn(Rectifier) I like how Tom Riddle is portrayed in this fic. He is a professor from an alternative universe where he did not turn evil, and although he is sane and "good", I thought it did a good job keeping him in character. The fic is sadly abandoned though.

#+begin_quote
  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5216059/1/Of-Elusive-Realities-and-Convincing-Facades]] Hermione/Voldemort, he's as sane as he can be, which is my favorite portrayal of him - a villain, still the bad guy, but intelligent, cunning and strong. I also really like the base idea for the story : the minister has gone crazy and is at war with both the Death Eaters AND the Order, so Voldemort and Dumbledore make a pact to work with each other until the ministry is done with. Hermione is sent as an emissary to stay with Voldemort and his side and make sure everything works well. It's an interesting idea and I liked the way it's used in the fic.

*** You were one of the first commenters so i read it first and my god... It's nearly 6am and I'm already 31 chapters in. I posted this midnight and I'm quite in love with this story...! Pity the author didn't seem to have completed it. I absolutely love her writing, the characters are very well written and developed, the plot is incredibly detailed (I definitely must reread this once I'm finished with it) and I'm so incredibly enamored with these set of characters vs the original set ngl! I'm not even finished but I think I must sleep now or else be absolutely hammered for staying awake over 24 hours...!

I really do love this Riddle. I'm happy thanks, this fic was perfect! I never really loved the HG/DM pairing but this one was stunning in the sense that it's not exactly DM from cannon! a much more lovelier pairing too than canon hg/rw lol

edit: it's 11:28am now and I finished the entire beautiful thing, thanks so much again for commenting it! Reverse has been a wonderful read...! Now time for me to take a nap and recover before resuming my daily activities (thank goodness it's the weekend haha)

  A chance meeting and Albus and Gellert would become inseparable friends, until the death of Albus' sister. But what if Ariana had survived? Almost a century later, a boy named Harry Potter would survive the Killing Curse, finally bringing an end to Grindelwald's war. Now, as he finds a place for himself at Hogwarts, there are signs that suggest that the war might not truly be over.

And he ends up working together with Harry when the latter starts seeing his memories via the scar horcrux, or something.

But I don't remember what it's called...

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

Some information, minor spoilers:

[[/spoiler][Harry is stuck in a loop, reliving his life over and over. He decides to try something different to bring an end to the loops. Harry captures Voldemort and forces him to merge with one of his Horcruxes. Voldemort realizes that the horcruxes weakened him and drove him insane - he goes and absorbs the others.]]

Fair warning, this is slash. Trust me when I say that I am /not/ a fan of slash.

This is one of the very few slash fics that I've read through despite that.
