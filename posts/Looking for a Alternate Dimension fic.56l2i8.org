Hey guys! Looking for a specific fic where Harry goes to an alternate dimension. He gets Sirius out of Azkaban, pretending to be his son.

He also pretends to have some kind of Divination ability, but he's just using his own knowledge of people. It later becomes an actual ability, but only once a year on a specific day at the Malloy's party.

Harry also meets with the surviving members of the Black Family, and they spread the rumor of Voldemort being a half blood. The head of the family dies when they go after the locket.

  The war drags on after Voldemort's defeat and the Order of the Phoenix is fighting a losing battle. When Harry is hit by yet another killing curse, he wakes up years in the past and in an alternate reality. As an unknown child in a foreign world, Harry has a chance to change the outcome of the war - while dealing with new magical talents, pureblood politics and Black family drama.
