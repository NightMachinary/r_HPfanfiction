I see a lot of fics where Harry is sorted into Slytherin and is friends with the kids over there instead of Ron and Hermione because of that, or he's still in Gryffindor but decides to ditch Ron and Hermione for whatever reason and befriends the Slytherin kids instead. What I'd like to read though and what I've never seen is a fic where Harry is still best friends with Ron and Hermione, and all three of them make friends with someone from Slytherin. I don't particularly mind who the character they befriend is, I'd just like to read something along this vein. thanks!

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

** Does it count when it takes a long time (in chapters and time in story) for the trio to befriend Slytherins?

**** It happens in my story "Patron", and involves a lengthy character development, especially for Pansy.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year. *Reviews contain SPOILERS!*
