:FlairText: What's That Fic? and Request
:END:
I've been searching for a lot of good fics to read but I can't seem to find any that suit my interests. I'm more or less looking for fics like linkffn(Not Your Usual Veela Mate) where Draco's a Veela, Harry has some sort of creature heritage, and it doesn't take place in Eighth Year nor does it completely follow the plot of the last few Harry Potter books. Of course, Harry doesn't exactly /have/ to be a creature, but I've only come across a few fics where Harry's like this (the other one being linkffn(DragonKin)) and I'm really interested in reading more.

I'd also be cool with neither of them having any creature heritage but they get close and Harry gets to know Snape and the Malfoys. I've read a few fics where Harry and the Malfoys get really close (like in DragonKin) and I'm really interested in reading more. But, as I said, I can't seem to find any that suits my interests. And I'd be okay if it's in Eighth Year but it's not really top priority.

I really do like reading wizarding politics fics (and, once again, like DragonKin) and if you have any you want to suggest (I'd still like it to be a Drarry fic, but I'd be okay if it's a fic where Harry's not shipped).

Thank you for helping!

Also: This isn't a Veela or creature story, but I love this story.

** Soup-pocolypse and the Great Curry Cataclysm. Post-war, very funny, well-written Veela Draco. Not your typical Veela fic though. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16036310/chapters/37431866]]

A few wonderful 8th year fics: Azoth: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1049966/chapters/2100285]] Things Worth Knowing: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12922518]]

And I share the Man Who Lived whenever I can. My all-time favorite fic. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9167785/chapters/20815621]]

  Draco is a Veela and guess who his mate is? I've tried to write a Veela story where the two don't jump into bed immediately, hence the title. Will contain Dumbledore bashing. HPDM LMSS AU from book 5
