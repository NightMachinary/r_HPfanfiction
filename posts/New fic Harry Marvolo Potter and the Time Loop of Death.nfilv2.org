I just published the first chapter. This is a non-slash, crack HP/LV fic where Harry and Tom get stuck in a never-ending time loop where they're killed over and over again, then brought back to experience it all again.

I've already typed up 9k words and it has 6 completed chapters. They will at first be a singular personality, but you will see their interactions as things pass and their experiences shape them. This is a dark fic, but I try to stay away from bad tropes. There will be Dumbledore bashing, but can you really blame Riddle for it?

I've uploaded 3 chapters, so it has some content as the first chapter is kind of lacking.

Here are some excerpts from the fic. Link | [[https://imgur.com/a/vUiZc1m][Imgur]]
