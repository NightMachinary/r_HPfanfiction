I just found a Slytherin!Ron fic on ao3 -- it's pretty short so it took me around ten minutes to read. I recommend it SO highly, especially if you like the slytherins in harry's year - there's a crazy amount of characterization for under 4,000 words. The author doesn't have any more fics, but for a one-shot it's great. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27653227]]
