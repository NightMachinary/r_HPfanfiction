It could be a Harry like harrymort from The Seventh Horcrux or the one where he is in Hufflepuff and is the god of laziness. Looking for interesting spins on the character, and maybe stories where Harry's different nature results in a different story than canon rehash. Please, no angst ridden Harry.


** "Realignment" by puzzleSB A Harry who has gone back in time to kill Voldemort while he is in school, he's blinded almost by his hatred for Tom and isn't a saint fic.

"A clock on the face of hell" by IdSayWhyNot Harry and Flitwick travel back from an apocalyptic future, really good dynamic between them and has a really good scene where Harry similar to a young dumbledore almost.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

  Fate was sealed that night. I was to live and fight, to breathe and conquer. The night I died and lived England celebrated the end of the nightmare that had yet to begin and praised the baby they would later fear and hate. I am Harry Potter. I am legend.

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.
