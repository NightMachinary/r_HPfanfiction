In a lot of crossover fanfics, the world has everything from aliens to magical beings living alongside regular humans. For example, DC crossovers would have Superman and Zatanna -- an alien and magician, respectively -- known to the public, along with a sizeable population of metahumans.

So, would the Wizarding World have any (rational) reason to keep itself hidden, especially if someone like Hermione became Minister or higher? If not, should they keep themselves hidden? I mean, what reasons would they have to keep themselves hidden, in a world where such fantastical individuals exist without (much) prejudice?


** Probably not, or not willingly. Why? Fear. The wizarding world as shown in the books is distinctly xenophobic. They fought wars over people coming into their world from the outside and brining new ideas.

Whether this alone would keep them isolated depends on the writer of the fic it's taking place in, but any exposure to the broader world would have to address a small, militant movement of wizards who oppose such an opening. My take, anyway.

*** Totally agreed. Removing them from their isolation would be a fight - a physical and cultural one.

** They would stay hidden.

While popular belief/propaganda says that the magical world stays hidden to keep themselves safe, that is clearly not the case. At most, it's a secondary benefit. The real reason why the magical world hid itself and stays hidden is because they don't like helping muggles with their problems.

Since the DC universe still has plenty of problems that could easily be solved with magic, the magical world will not want to reveal itself. But they might in the Star Trek universe, because it's a post-scarcity society where technology has already fixed most people's problems.

I still like the idea that the Eugenics Wars were actually an escalated / more widespread development of the war with Voldemort. Technology in Trek seems more like magic at times - what if it actually /is/ magic, at least in part?

**** According to Pottermore (up to you how canon you consider it) the eugenic wars started out with the implementation of the Statute of Secrecy. Malfoys are specifically stated that they got a lot of their wealth through deals with the Muggles. The conflict between Wizards and Muggles started when Wizards started abusing their powers over them and Muggles retaliated by hunting down the magical children and the weak ones. I can understand why the Magical community would feel annoyed when many that (assuming they were competent wizards) had to take one for the team. In any case there are cases of high ups in the Ministry who tried to promote anti-Muggle sentiments but seems like they were quite unpopular with the community. I think the boiling point was reached during Grindelwald's time. During Voldemort's time there was a feeling of resignation and people thought "So we're not supposed to integrate in your community? Then fuck off and don't force your kind down our throats."

****** And that is definitely one of my better ones. The story I mentioned was because if the HP link to the Eugenics wars. To my knowledge I was the only writer to link HP to the Eugenics Wars of ST, at least at the time. No calls to read, just noting it's been done.

  The battle at the Ministry ended differently for Harry. When he came out of the fog of Time Turner dust, he found himself over 300 years in the future. Now he needs to find his home again.

** I think they would probably stay hidden. After all, governments and private organizations have often attempted to seize control of meta humans and other super powered beings.. So there would be even more of a risk to the magical world as people began a magical arms reace the way they did with meta humans.

** Xenophobia and cultural superiority. Bhutan is a real world country with minimal contact with the outside world, and the WW apparent belief that non-magical humans don't actually matter much would make it pretty plausible that they'd at least try to keep it up. Probably with increasingly desperate measures.

** They would probably stay hidden, even in DC, many of the magic users and heroes, in general, are very private people.

Zatanna is an exception that in some versions she also performs magic in a stage for entertainment, but other magical users, like Constantine and Dr. Fate prefer to remain more discreet.

Why would they reveal themselves, I see no benefit, it would mostly be a hassle for them, heroes can mostly protect themselves, what about wizarding children?
