Okay, so we all know that book Ron and Harry would die right off the bat without Hermione. So this is a prompt that takes this to the next logical extreme. Hermione but just her.

She would need to be the chosen one herself so all the "mark her as his equal" jazz. Maybe you make her just as powerful as harry was ie (will power with wands connecting, or patronous 100 demontors)

This could also show how hermione would handle the the fame.

Also how have her parents dified him 3 times?

*/Her parents are muggles, he hates muggles./*

*/Her parents are dentists, he is a part of the Rotfang Conspiracy./*

*/Emma Granger turned down his advances or something... Idk you're the writer/*

Point being she could do it just herself and i would like to see a Granger-Who-Lives fic if there are any.


** Hermione with no friends is a very sad Hermione. Just make her the Chosen One and Ron and non-Chosen Harry (raised by Lily and James) as her normal friends.

As to how she fits the prophecy, I haven't a clue, but prophecies are fuzzy things at the best of times.
