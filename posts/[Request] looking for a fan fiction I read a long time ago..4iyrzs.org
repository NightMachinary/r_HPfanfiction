Many years ago. like idk 8 years. I read a Fan fiction about there being a Asian exchange student and harry starting to access more 100% of his brain capacity. Then the story became very Dragon Ball Z inspired. I especially remember one of the uses of dragon blood being akin to a sensu bean. I want to say the tittle had something to do with Ki Wizards. There was also a sequal that had to do with an elemental staff and stopping voldemorts son from obtaing it.

If anybody could help or even remembers the story it would be a great help. Idk why but I can not get the fic out of my head.


** Sounds like a grade A badfic I would love to read it for the lulz unfortunately I know of no such fic, Sorry
