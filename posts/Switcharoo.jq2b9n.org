I'm quite interested in stories where Neville is the BWL, and Harry's parents tortured into insanity.

I'd like it if it was Harry-centric, preferably Dark!Harry, but It doesn't matter to me.

But please, NO Harry/Tom Riddle, or LV.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. But while Harry deliberately hides his growing skills, Minerva worries more and more about the mysterious, brilliant student writing to her who may be venturing into dangerous magical territory.

** Knowledge is Power ( there's more than a few by the same title by different authors) - the plot is a bit different though.
