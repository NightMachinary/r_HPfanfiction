I remember reading this awhile back. Voldemort won the war, the Potters lived and Harry became Malfoys assistant to spy for the order.

  In 1986 Voldemort gained victory and established his regime all over Great Britain. Magical world is secluded from muggles and is being ruled by the Dark Lord and his generals - ex-Death Eaters. All muggleborns were branded as political criminals and lost most of their rights. Muggleborn children are still accepted to study at Hogwarts, however, in 1997 a law was promulgated, that prohibited any wizards and witches to have a muggle parent, and all the non-magical relatives were to be executed in order to keep the magical Britain safe from muggles. The opposition has formed their own Resistance Party and keeps constantly fighting the Dark Lord and his new government. There are no horcruxes in this story, no prophecy, the Potter family was never attacked. Harry grew up with his parents, went to Hogwarts, where he met his two best friends Ron and Hermione, graduated seven years later and found a job at the Diagon Alley. Nobody knows Harry Potter - he is an ordinary half-blood wizard, living an ordinary life. Or at least he used to think so, until he found himself involved into an intricate and dangerous game...
