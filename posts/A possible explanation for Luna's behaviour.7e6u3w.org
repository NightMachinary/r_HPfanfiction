I just had a thought regarding Luna. A number of people assume she's crazy/has mental issues for believing in invisible/imaginary animals no one has ever found. Others call her "quirky". We know she firmly believes in the existence of the animals her father writes about, and she is passionate about them, though tolerates a lot, too.

I wonder if the closest example of similar behaviour wouldn't be a girl raised by very religious parents who firmly believes in invisible angels/god(s)/miracles/fate etc., even when confronted with a school full of sceptics/atheists, and often takes the high road when mocked by hostile students, but stands firm by her belief/faith even when pressed and lacking any proof.

Thoughts?


** she also believes that Fudge cooks goblins into pies and Sirius Black disguised himself as the lead singer of the Hobgoblins. I am pretty sure the closest thing is someone raised by a firm believer of conspiracy theory's. Like she is the one person who believes the government tries to brainwash everyone and hides Bigfoot from the world

*** The argument is stupid though. The reason people believe in dragons is because they're documented to be seen by many wizards in the Harry Potter series and the reason muggles don't believe in them is because they're being actively hidden and knowledge of them is destroyed.

Besides, the same argument could be used for the existence of literally anything at all that you can come up with, which should show you it's not that great.

**** Your second point stands, but Luna's reasoning /is/ that people are hiding the existence of the creatures. For instance, we know she believes Heliopaths are Minister Fudge's "secret army", so /of course/ he'd cover up their existence up. Which isn't that hard to do in the wizarding world when you think about it, as long as there aren't too many specimens. Put up protective enchantments on the areas they are known to inhabitate, tag them with some sort of Disillusionment Charm if necessary, and if worst comes to worst Obliviate witnesses. Heck, Canon has Slytherin hide a freaking Basilisk under the Hogwarts Professors' very nose for a thousand years, and Hagrid apparently cover up an /entire Acromantula colony/'s existence for fifty years.

** While it's possible that Luna's behavior is akin to a very religious girl, I'm not sure it fits.

It think it's helpful to actually look at canon--and that means the books, not the films--and what we see from Luna.

Luna goes on and on about various creatures, but the only ones she ever thinks may be in the same room she's in are Wrackspurts and Nargles.

She describes Wrackspurts as invisible creatures that burrow into ears and make minds go fuzzy.

Nargles are described as infesting mistletoe. And, in the books, she does not describe them as capable of theft.

So, let's assume that Nargles and Wrackspurts are unknown insects or arachnids of some sort. And that Wrackspurts can cause disorientation and confusion.

In a world where Billywigs--three inch long, electric-blue wasps that cause levitation when a victim is stung--Nargles and Wrackspurts sound completely plausible.

Elsewhere, Luna describes the Rot-Fang Conspiracy, heliopaths, Fudge's assassination of goblins.

The Rot-Fang Conspiracy is most likely bogus, but there's very likely a level of corruption in the Auror Department. Auror Dawlish is mentioned as having been sent by the Voldemort Ministry to arrest Augusta Longbottom.

Heliopaths are described as "great spirits of fire" that "gallop and consume everything in their path."

Now, I don't think heliopaths are real, even in the Harry Potter Universe, but it's not out of the question. But more likely, it's possible that someone saw Ministry officials trying to control Fiendfyre and used "heliopaths" as a cover.

Most often, we see Luna get angry when Hermione dismisses the descriptions. It's also worth mentioning that Hermione has a tendency to sound extremely smug and self-righteous about it.

Luna gets offended because not just because she thinks these things are real. Multiple eye-witnesses discussed these things with her father. Quite possibly when Luna was in the room. Luna believed the eye-witnesseses. She takes them at their word. An attack on her father, saying that the /Quibbler/ is full of "rubbish" is an attack on people who saw these things they can barely explain.

Luna is honest. She believes in honesty. She also has a habit of commenting on embarrassing truths.

I think it's worth noting that she's introduced in /Order of the Phoenix./ When very few people were willing to take Harry at his word, Luna is.

Luna is not delusional. She is not insane. She is not schizophrenic. +She is not quirky.+ She is not a seer. She is honest.

Edit: Okay, maybe Luna can be called quirky. But she isn't a Manic Pixie Dream Girl.

Perhaps it has to be seen in reverse and she actually knows that people have Wrackspurts because people are confused.\\
I mean, it could very well be her method of noticing them.
