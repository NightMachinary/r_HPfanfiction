I´m writing fanfiction atm and want to know what you think if casting a lot of magic should exhaust the user physically and or mentally or not at all?

By casting a lot of magic I mean to the person casting. For example, a person that rarely uses more than household spells might get exhausted from casting let's say 10 bombarda as an example but an auror needs to cast at least 50 bombarda to feel exhausted.


** I could imagine someone becoming physically tired from waving their wand arm around for an extended period of time, and if they were in a fight then there would be the expected post-adrenaline crash and feelings of exhaustion. Also if they were forced to keep their Patronus out for a prolonged period, I could imagine them feeling emotionally drained, especially if they were combating Dementors.

But as for being magically drained, I couldn't really say for sure. But part of my uncertainty comes from not knowing if the wellspring from whence a wizard's or witch's power comes from is internal or external.

** Canon does not show any evidence of exhaustion. Wizards cast spells with no sign of getting tired or having to ration their use. I'm fine with fanfictions where it isn't, but you can absolutely make action scenes creative and limited by other factors than magic stamina, which is sort of the easiest and not the most creative limiter.

*** But wizards in canon don't just throw a thousand spells/minute so we don't know. The Patronus exhausts Harry and Harry is also extremely exhausted after the third task (which is the only instance where Harry had to cast a bunch of different spells in a short amount of time - albeit it could be argued that it was physical exhaust combined with a broken leg and the shock of Voldemort returning). So canon, other than the Patronus, is not indicative of the toll casting magic takes on you.

**** What drains Harry in those lessons is the effect of the boggart-dementor, not the effect of casting the Patronus. We know this because:

1. In response to Harry feeling drained, Lupin explains that Dementors drain wizards of their powers and offers Harry chocolate to remedy the feeling, which is the remedy for the effects of Dementors; and

2. When Harry casts the Patronus against Malfoy pretending to be a dementor, he feels no such drain, and indeed explicitly comments to Lupin that he felt nothing; Lupin responds that the reason for this is that there was no real Dementor nearby.

On the flip side, there are plenty of passages in canon where characters cast many spells without feeling exhaustion. The most obvious example is Harry practising the Summing Charm before the First Task, where he casts the spell over and over for hours on end, and over this period is noted to get /better/ at the spell, quite the opposite of magical exhaustion (though he is tired from staying up late into the night). But there are plenty of other examples such as the fight in the Department of Mysteries.

More broadly, one can see that magic forms the backbone of wizards' daily lives, used to do everything from household chores to administrative office work. It is not intended to be something scarce that needs to be reserved for special occasions, nor is it supposed to be revered or treated as in some sense holy; rather, magic is as normal to wizards as breathing. Magical exhaustion does not fit with a society where magic is used frivolously and whimsically.

As to how to create conflict, this is simple enough: the other side has magic too. Wizard on wizard combat is the question of what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object and I think that's far more interesting than making it a contest of whose fuel tank runs dry first.

The only conflict that inexhaustible magic really affects is that of wizards vs. Muggles, where lots of Mugglewank fics limit magic compared to canon to give Muggles more of a chance.

** In my headcanon there's nothing metaphysical about it, a magical dual is exhausting because you're running around and dodging for your life while your life also depends on how fast and perfectly your can rotate your wand 37° while multiplying 473 by 983, and then keep doing that for the entirety of a battle. It's not actually math in my head, it's some intentionally vague notion of thinking really hard about how the spell works.

** I always prefer it this way personally. Whether you use 'magical cores' or 'willpower' or 'channelling rate', I feel you need some sort of limit on what the characters can to so that the outcome of problems or conflicts don't feel arbitrary. It is easier to get invested in a character if you feel that the challenges that face them are pushing the boundries of what they can achieve. Making a 'cost' to using abilities which can be described as pain or exhaustion, at least if you are nearing the limit, is common because it is easy for the reader to understand. That is not to say you can't use another limit system, but it may be harder to make it feel intuative to the reader, especially when characters are struggling.

It also justifies the need for allies/minions (depending what side you are on). If it is clear that there are limits to what an individual can achieve, then winning a conflict requires help. Then you can have sub-goals for your characters throughout the story where they neutralise Death Eaters and gather or protect friends which feels like it contributes to the plot as a whole. If any wizard can manage any amount of magic, then you could run the risk of having the final dramatic showdown at the end make the reader feel like much of the characters and setting and plot was entirely pointless if everything just comes down to which guy can say words quicker.

*** Limiting magical endurance is fine, but it should not be a mana system. Rather, I prefer that magical exhaustion should be akin to being dead on your feet like after a few hours of endurance sports. So it's not "out of magic but otherwise fine", but rather the caster on the verge of blacking out.

** It depends on what you're using to keep the story balanced, and how important spellcasting is.

Will there be a lot of focus on magical combat and duelling? Then exhaustion probably should be an important factor.

Is it more relationship-focused - not necessarily shipping, but focused on people and how they interact with each other? Then conservation of energy is probably not an issue that you need to worry about; feel free to ignore any spell costs.

Are you planning to fuse the magical and muggle worlds and revolutionise everything? Then you should probably have a careful plan of how you're going to make magic work, and what its limitations are; wizards running out of energy in some fashion will probably be a critical factor.

It depends on the story you want to write. Magical exhaustion is not relevant and not addressed in eg Grow Young With Me, which is a romance, or Strangers at Drakeshaugh, which is about Harry and Ginny interacting with new neighbours, but a big deal in, say, Methods of Rationality, which is about applying scientific thinking to the study of magic.

** I mean, it wasn't in canon, but fic is all about changing things, so you've gotta ask yourself if the change you're making serves a purpose. If you've got a plot in mind where limited spells/day is an importsnt part of things, sure, go ahead. If it isn't actually relevant for anything but the odd moment of dramatic effect, you might want to just go with the usual kind of wrist/arm fatigue that people would get from waving a wand around all day.

** as someone with chronic fatigue I'm pretty familiar with exhaustion, and the cost that a lot of different activities have on the body, so I tend to go with yes, all humans have a limit, and I don't think that casting magic would be any different from anything else.

I feel like most of the time people won't realise they do when they're doing everyday spells, like Molly Weasley, for instance, is casting all day, but she does a lot of skilful magic without really thinking about it. Maybe she says people are being silly when they are impressed with her work or aren't as good at ‘simple household tasks' but everyone is built different and so capacity might be different too (as someone with a mother who had six kids I certainly know that some women do have to buckle down and learn to just do things out of necessity, capacities are still very different).

But it still has a cost. You will not understand how much energy just doing maths takes, for instance, until you're under duress of some sort, and suddenly you're sweating while trying to calculate the amounts needed in a recipe or something, and you're like why is this /physically/ taxing? What the hell?

things we mentally have learned by rote /are/ tiring, and do take energy, it's just most of the time we don't notice; so I think that mental exhaustion especially is significantly likely with certain types of magic, more than others. Perhaps there are spells that take a lot of mental concentration. Perhaps there are spells that only need you think about it clearly before hand and others that need sustained magical intention to ‘hold' it.

These days, I tend to think about magical channels, and channeling magic, and possibly storing for short periods of time like a reservoir where it can pool on the way through? rather than a body creating magic somehow in an an organ, but then I think of it as something that will cause inflammation when overused, and possibly some people are better able to channel magic in large amounts than others but then can they control it well or is it a blunt force thing? Maybe Dumbledore is particularly glorified because he can control large amounts of magic with unsettling finesse.

So what I'm trying to say is in my mind you can grow exhausted and inflamed and mentally exhausted depending on the type of magic; and milage may differ. Perhaps transfiguration, for instance, is particularly difficult because you're having to be very intentional and scientific almost; and then maybe you have to use quite a lot of power all at once (or perhaps some people have to take such transformations in stages? So maybe transfiguring a match to a needle is possible but I think it might be quite unpleasant not to be able to do live transfigurations in one instant, because of the need to breath and stuff?) and other spells are a little different, because it's more about channeling the magic a certain way.

Maybe some people have magical endurance and others don't, so some could hold a sustained augmenti, while someone else is better at conjuring and transfiguring, doing that blast of magic all at once.

** How does it make your story better?

- Is it wank that Harry has the biggest mana pool since merlin? Eh.
- is it to talk about how Dumbles blocked magic? Eh
- is it so your character "runs out" of magic in a crucial moment, then screams loudly, and suddenly can do one last spell? Not as bad, but still overdone.
- is it just world building without effect? Then why make people mad?

There's so many ways to use the fact, and most of them are bad. Your fanfic is (usually) not an RPG, it's not a DnD adventure that needs to be "balanced" for engaging gameplay, and talking about how powerful your character is is telling, not showing.

It's first and foremost a story. If it makes the story better, whatever. Do it.

But most uses of the "mana pool" / magical core are just annoying, and boil down to telling instead of showing

*** I think The Pureblood Pretense pulls off "Harry has unusually large magic reserves" quite well. She's obsessed with potions, not dueling, so having lots of magic is only marginally useful; an advantage for brewing a lot back to back, but hardly critical. And then, when her core matures at thirteen, she has so much magic that she can't use it; it's like the kitchen tap has been replaced with a fire hose. /And/ it makes her stand out, which threatens to expose the identity swap.

It's still useful in a variety of ways, but she'd probably be just as happy being more normal.

I'm keeping this realism by causing casting spells to sap the casters stamina just like any other physical activity would. The stronger the spell, the bigger that person's drain on their own energy/stamina is

One of my biggest gripes from canon and a lot of fanfiction is that they just act like magic is free, allowing people to cast infinetly. This is lazy writing imo

********* I get the impression that they're saying “magical exhaustion” is a lazy excuse for wrapping up a fight because it's much more interesting to explore other reasons why a character might falter enough for the other to get an upper hand.

I certainly agree that a fic should not include a scene where characters just fire spells at each other with no need to pause for hours, because that sounds incredibly boring, and I don't think commenter is arguing for that either. Fight scenes shouldn't be long, indulgent power fantasies, but there are other ways to limit characters that aren't such obvious solutions.

Having magic exhausts characters is more realistic (although there's really no way to make magic follow the laws of physics, but just in terms of character relatability, it's important to get exhausted after hard work) and its an easy plot point to work with. It provides built in limitations so you don't have to develop something more creative yourself. That's what they meant by lazy. Not that it's bad, or even that the alternative of no exhaustion is better, but just that it's not especially creative.

********** I like the whole idea that the stronger of spells you throw out take a larger toll on you. I mean for Christ sakes, if you do something mentally strenuous you can get physically exhausted, but throwing out actual power from your body shouldn't cause exhaustion over time? I get that it's magic, but that makes zero sense to me.

Look at any other form of fighting or sport, physical stamina is the number one most important thing after skill no matter what it is. In MMA, the first person to get gassed (out of stamina) is almost always the loser. In track, if you can't pace yourself correctly, you are not winning the race.

I see throwing out magical spells as no different from any other activity. If you want to produce a result, you need to expend energy to do it. Being able to expect results with no input of energy is a power fantasy.

Also, stamina is a good way to structure fights. It may be unimaginative, but the same can be said for unlimited magic. At least with having to deal with a characters stamina, you have to plan out the fights according to how intense you want your character to output there magic on top of strategy, positioning and everything else.

I argue that removing the stamina requirement for spells is more lazy because your removing an entire layer of fighting tactics

Edit: to add, stamina playing a role in a wizards ability to cast over time also adds an additional layer of complexity to fighting because you now get to explore how efficient a caster is. That's one thing I am using in my harry potter fanfic is efficiency. Every witch and wizard has different magical strengths and weaknesses that fall along the lines of 3 spectrums simultaneously. Peak output, throughput, and efficiency. Peak output for a witch or wizard is the maximum amount of strength they can throw into any single spell. Throughput is the maximum they can channel for a stretch of time, and efficiency is how efficient they are using their magic to fuel their spells. For example, I can have a character that has enough peak to cast fiendfyre, but they don't have enough throughput to maintain fiendfyre. This would make fiendfyre a poor choice of spell tacticaly for this witch or wizard, and allows me to explain why some people can cast certain spells and others cannot. Each charecter I'm planning fight scenes for have different values along these 3 spectrums that allows me to shape out their tactics more than just throwing spells around.

Physical fitness is also going to matter because you can't roll around, dodge spells and run if your not in good physical condition

These are not limits. Arms up is an action or tactic, not a limit. Move towards their target a tactic and action, not a limit. Maintaining focus is an action, not a limit. Eating food and drinking water are not limits to magical fighting, nor are they tactics, nor are they actions germain to the fight in that moment because you are not going to drink water or eat food in the middle of a fight.

In fact, the only limit you actually provided is 'ward off sleepiness" which would, in fact, be energy/stamina management, which comes along with expending energy, which is exactly what casting a spell is.-an energy expenditure. I didn't point it out before but you actually argued my point /for/ me

At /best/ you listed tactics, with some of them, like food and water not being an action, tactic, or limit.

************* You need physical energy to keep your arms up, focus your mind, move, and this physical energy is replenished with resources such as time, food, water. As you say, you can't easily replenish stamina in a fight, unless maybe you can do so by casting the right magic or drinking the right potion. All of this is a limit on your ability to endlessly cast.

My point is that adding further stamina consumption or mana consumption from spell casting itself is not more realistic. It is also not more creative, as you still need to account for many factors and tactics in writing plot events.
