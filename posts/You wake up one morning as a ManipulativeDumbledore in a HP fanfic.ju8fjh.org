What do you do next?

Edit: You're on hard mode with a Indie Harry with 100+ lordships and a gazillion galleons.


** The No. 1 rule of survival in most Indy!Lordship!CroesusEatYourHeartOut!Harry fics is as follows:

/Thou shalt be on the same side as Harry... sorry, Lord Hadrian James Ignotus Peverell-Black-Potter./

People who follow this rule tend to be happy, successful, wealthy and powerful (if not to the same degree as the aforementioned Lord H.J.I.P.B.P.); those who break it, on the other hand, usually become disliked, ridiculed, powerless, and sometimes dead.

With that in mind, my course of action as Manipulative!Dumbledore is clear: immediately scrap each and every scheme that goes against Lord H.J.I.P.B.P.'s interests, silence everyone who might be in the know (not that many people, assuming my new body's former owner wasn't a total idiot), and generally support said Lord in doing whatever he wants to do. No point in trying to get him to fight Voldemort or fulfill the prophecy or destroy Horcruxes: it will all happen anyway, and everything will be fine, because Lord H.J.I.P.B.P. is just that awesome. No point in trying to get him to conform to any school rules or any laws (magical or otherwise) - why would I, Manipulative!Dumbledore, care about such insignificant things?

The only thing I'll have to watch out for is a situation where Lord H.J.I.P.B.P. finds out about anything Dumbledore did to wrong him prior to my reincarnation... in which case, it's time to blame a subordinate or two. Sorry, Minerva. Nothing personal, Severus.

(Or I could suggest for some more girls to join Lord H.J.I.P.B.P.'s already impressive harem. That should distract him for ten chapters or so, and by then he'll hopefully forget about that particular plot point)

With all that done, and as long as I don't violate Rule 2 - which is, of course, /Thou shalt not be in any way more awesome than Lord Hadrian James Ignotus Peverell-Black-Potter/ - I should be safe and free to do anything I want. Maybe pass some pro-werewolf legislation first - it /is/ pretty embarrasing when literal Death Eaters are more progressive on this issue than I am.

**** Not the point.

You, as Main Bumblebee, do not have an interest in either those people, or those pairings. There is no motive linking you to them, so it nicely accomplishes it's purpose: to send That Guy on a wild goose chase for several chapters, allowing you to fake your death in a heroic fashion and move to Antarctica/Venus.

Why there? Low fic apprearance number, and the climate is no challenge at all for the great wizard that is I, that is, specialized in transfiguration and charms. Earth is lost, but I am not.

Additionally, the world is a shitty place, so I will have my pick of lost, broken people I can get the loyalty of with a small kindness and take with me. The kindness will be genuine - I will be spending a lot of time with those people, and I will be the one choosing them anyway. I'm hardly going to take anyone who would be missed, or anyone I'd dislike.

After all, even on the scale of 'has nine lordships', it's all just British politics. I've never understood why so many fanfic authors fall for Rowling's assumption that the UK is the center of the magical world, when it's obviously a social backwater and outside of Dumbledore doesn't seem to have any voice in the world-level government at the ICW.

** "I don't like this word. 'Manipulative'. It makes me sounds like a bad guy. I am not a bad guy, Harry. I am merely older than you. More experienced."

I am a gamer. More than that, a completionist. If I become manipulative!Dumbledore against Indy!Harry, I will continue following this road.

It's not that hard to defeat an indy!harry, anyway. Get the Goblins to follow you rather than Harry - all you need is a proper greeting, some money, a bit of knowledge of their language and culture, and remember the name of a goblin or two. That's one powerfull ally "defeated".

Potions. I have Severus Snape, arguably the best potion master of this century. He'll work towards controlling the potter brat with pleasure, by, you know, developping new, never before seen potions. Love, hate, doesn't matter, as long as Snape creates a new version, and elves do the job... by working for someone else. Probably an imperiused, let's say... Draco Malfoy. I need to weaken the dark.

Dark, Light- Wizengamot! No way am I gonna leave one of my three jobs. I'll convince the light that lord lots of things has, by consuming family magic from so many families, become insane. Also, send an annonymous letter to various member of the dark: "Lord thousand families wants you, your line, your family and your lord vanquished and forgotten" we can then take the little time left to work together, united, towards one goal: stopping one person from holding more than two houses worth of votes. Three, if a family bitches around. I'm not picky.

Then, because manipulative!Dumbledore works towards making poor lord Hadrian sad and unhappy, only two wives are accepted for one man. And two husbands for one woman. Too many family names? Well, your children can carry them. Make more than one I guess.

Let's see, what else... oh, yeah. Sirius. Better give him a trial. He's gonna get one anyway, may as well be on my own terms.

Voldemort! I dunno. If he's alive again I'll strenghten the wards, and put another curse that'll be active if I am thrown out of Hogwarts: if the curse on the DADA position is broken, another curse (the same one) will appeat on one of the core classes. Betrayed by everyone? Haha, look at you, dear Minnie the traitor. You're fucking dead.

Hum... I think I've got the philosopher's stone? Also contacts with the department of mystery. Which means, time turners.

Worst case scenario, I send Harry to Azkaban illegally. By fucking portkey.

*** This is great! Stopping Potter from getting some many lordship titles is a wonderful idea!

You just have to avoid the protagonist's halo/plot armour.

You should be wary of goblin factions, some will support Harry because his ancestors helped them out one time.

For whatever reason, the potions you give the boy just stop working one day. So you'll need a countermeasure against that.

Sending Harry to Azkaban may actually make me a Lord of Azkaban, in which all the dementors ender up bowing and obeying only him.

Lord of Azkaban, eeeh. Didn't think about that. Let's just say that the way he manages to control the Dementors is awfully familiar to Voldemort. Let the prophet do the blaming. Now he's got dark creatures, but no allies.

When everything is settled, apologize to Harry for his placement there, place as much blame as possible on Ms Figg for sending positive reports back about how well Harry was doing (maybe memory charm her to that effect).

Then put Ms Figg on trial and get her stuffed in Azkaban to be forgotten there.

Move Harry into Hogwarts and introduce him to McGonnagal and admit to him that she tried to stop him from being sent to the Dursleys.

When Harry is 9 or 10, inform him of his lordships and wealth and ask to allow me (Dumbledore) to act as his proxy.

** A couple of possible ideas...

To steal part of an idea from someone else on this thread... transfigure someone else into Dumbledore and either brainwash them or just tell them to act like him. Then I can transfigure myself into a teenager and enrol myself into Hogwarts.

But where my plan differs is that instead of plotting against Lord Hadrian Black-Peverell-Potter-etc I will instead just go about life as a student, just chilling. If my path does cross with Lord Hadrian then I can just insert myself as one of his groupies, not necessarily anyone important to his inner circle or harem but just a random student who gushes over how great he is.

From here I could go a few ways. Could try a risky route of infiltrating the inner circle or harem, although Lord Hadrian's lordship rings might find me out. I'd have to work on a strong cover in that case.

if I'm allowed to pull some BS magic out of my hat then perhaps I could use some kind of temporary memory charm/imperious/confundus/what spell I'm able to make up to specifically suite my goal, this will make me believe I am actually a Hogwarts student and act as such, until such a time as a trigger occurs to snap me out of it.

The trigger could be a time limit or certain event, or if I'm allowed loyal minions like Snape then just have him do it.

Perhaps try to link my new identity with that of an ancient lost house which has no connection to Hadrian (and I'd assume they exist since even Hadrian needs some incentive for all these marriage contracts). Using the resources I gained from mugging Flamel of his Philosopher's Stone and all the standard Manipulative!Dumbledore evil deeds I can secretly forge documents and set up a whole history, maybe even transfiguring some minions or mind controlled Death Eaters (because screw those guys) into acting as my new identity's family.

So I would create this new identity as being a young girl around Lord Hadrian's age who fits all his criteria and is the heir to an ancient lost house. To ensure he has no connection to it the identity should be foreign, maybe France or if Europe is too close then maybe the heir to some ancient family of Japanese Wizards or something. Either way its something to draw Hadrian in. If France is an option though I'd probably just go with that, probably safer. Could have them be a transfer student from Beauxbatons.

Once in the harem/marriage contract group I can simply bid my time from the shadows and work out the next stage of my plan from within.

****** I'm thinking something that's powerful but also takes a while to work, so it slowly overwhelms even the OP Lordship Rings. Maybe something that doesn't take effect at first.

Just before the curse takes effect I can have the Death Eater I transfigured into Dumbledore attack Lord Hadrian, fail and get killed by either him or the Aurors. This both gives the clean slate suggested and also makes Hadrian assume any ill effects he feels from the curse are the works of him.

In fact to prepare I can leave a false trail of breadcrumbs for him to find, talking about a new curse Dumbledore found and used on him in the attack and lead him on a sidequest to find the countercurse.

An AK Ring is also a good idea, although fast working so it might risk outing myself as an imposter to his loyal followers.

Overall though infillitrating and working with Lord Hadrian is probably the smartest choice, openly working against him will just bring down his OPness upon me.

Honestly even without a cursed ring, leading Hadrian on a wild goose chase could work, just lead bread crumbs to apparent schemes or stolen vaults. Dose myself with Love Potion aimed at Ron or something so Hadrian is busy focusing on the Weasleys while plot against him. If I use France as my backstory then send him on a journey through France to find ancient Gaelic magic lost to time and only reclaimable to the most worthy.

Use that /exact/ name for His Lordship, the look on his face will be priceless and it'll buy me a couple of seconds to make a getaway.

** Get my money, pack my things, and move to some nice tropical island. Let Harry angst and vent by himself. Because if I try anything, Harry with his harems, billion gazillion galleons, hundreds of Wizangemot seats, uber powerful spells he can fart out his backside, I'm sure to loose.

Nah better to cut my losses and get the hell away while I can. Wizarding Britain is a dumpster anyway.

Then I'd either drink rejuvenating potion, or just use some form of permanent Polyjuice potion to regain nice youthful body and just enjoy life

** 1. Let it "slip" to Snape "accidentally" that Harry is Lord Slytherin so that dear Voldie knows. Voldemorts focus is now on Harry, not me.
2. Pass a legislation that banns Veritaserum and Magical oaths under penalty of death.
3. !Only if I take control before the Goblet of fire! As I am Harry's magical guardian I empty his Vaults with a few well-placed imperious curses and relocate them to Argentina and preferably into Dwarfern Banking if possible or under a mountain.
4. (After Harry Kills Voldemort) Bind Harry's magic in his sleep after he is given a sleeping potion whilst he is recovering from some curse/injury/"accident" bind him in actual chains encase him in a "Whatever the strongest magical Metal is that preferably is magic resistant" box together with some dementors and drown him in the Mariana trench to by some time or kill him.
5. ( if all of the above worked) Change my name, face, age, body type, etc. Fake my death. Give all my wealth away to my Argentinian cousin. "Have some death eaters kill my brother" burn my paper trail in the ministry or burn the ministry down in an "unfortunate accident" caused by Ronald Weasley.
6. Live the high life

** To be honest, a lot of the lordships and riches makes a lot of sense. I don't see exactly why everyone is bad-mouthing it. I mean, it can be done horribly and people probably over-exhaust the trope, but you can't deny that he does---depending on how the world's laws on this works---have claim to them.\\
He was Sirius' godson and Sirius was pretty much the only living Black who could claim it(Narcissa was married and I'm not sure how that works, Andromeda was married /and/ disowned, Bellatrix was married several times as I remember it, Regulus was dead). When Sirius died, what happened to the Most Noble and Ancient House Of Black?\\
We also know Harry is related to the Peverells on his dad's side(who was also a Potter, an old pureblood family). We also know he's a descendent of Slytherin(I think), if you don't count Voldie which we shouldn't. And even if we did, Voldie didn't survive the Battle.\\
So those would probably give him seats on the Wizengamot. Then, let's look at money, the Blacks are a wealthy wizarding family. Purebloods. The Potters are also an old and wealthy family, too, and we probably haven't even seen most of their combined wealth. Something about Sleek-Eazy(sp?), as I recall.\\
I'm not certain on the other two.

*** The Blacks /were/ wealthy, sure. But given Sirius' parents were certifiably batshit, as were his aunts and uncles to have produced Bellatrix and Narcissa, chances are most of that money got funneled to the Dark Lord's coffers.

Except for the part where those aren't purely hereditary in canon. It's unclear how exactly Wizengamot members are selected, but the one way they're all-but-confirmed /not/ to work in canon is hereditary seats.

There are 2 confirmed resignations, and Dumbledore got removed from his position by the Minister - that wouldn't happen if seats are purely hereditary, nor would Umbridge have been on it during Fudge's time (her parentage is decidedly un-privileged).\\
If Harry tried to claim a seat or future seat, he'd canonically just have a Minister for Magic laughing in his face or saying "sure, study magical law hard enough..." in a mildly patronizing way.

Filthy rich, he canonically /is/. The Potter vault is stocked to the point of "Harry can basically buy whatever, but he's too young to be making sound financial decisions". Add to that Sirius's inheritance (which is a lot, including all of 12 Grimmauld Place and a bunch of money)...

Of course, this being a fanfiction subreddit, the Hereditary Wizengamot Seat is so common that it's easy to forget that it isn't canonically a Thing™ and you're free to use it anyway (although I've never seen the trope done well).

**** Except we don't know that it doesn't exactly work like that. Maybe it really is hereditary, but they have the ability to kick someone off the Wizengamot. But we would replace them? Maybe they have the ability to ‘give' their seat to someone else. Like a proxy. One must only be good at manipulation (unless you know the person to whom the seat belongs and they'd realistically give it to you), to grab the position.

Other than these, I have no bloody idea.
