Any fics where Harry doesn't attend Hogwarts for first year, disappears or drops out after a small amount of time (Like a year or something)? Could be Time Travel (Quantum Leaping or Physically showing up to raise his younger self) or Harry just being Mary-Sue levels of genius.! Any and All shipping is appreciated :)


** linkffn(The Ilvermorny Champion) Harry attends Ilvermorny, and is their Champion in the Triwizard Tournament. (Durmstrang was disqualified due to a scandal involving Karkaroff.)

  Instead of Durmstrang Academy, Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was invited to take part in the 1994 Triwizard Tournament. When Ilvermorny arrives at Hogwarts, Albus Dumbledore is shocked to see the long-thought-dead Harry and Lily Potter appear, as well as the missing Sirius Black and Remus Lupin.

  The savior of magical Britain is believed dead until he shows up to fight Death Eaters. Hermione Granger is a very lonely young woman without a single friend until she boards the Hogwarts Express for her sixth year, and her life take a major turn. SERIOUS WARNING. Rated M for a reason. DO NOT READ if easily offended.

** linkffn(The Leader) is a vampire Harry who leaves Hogwarts and never comes back. Dumbledore and Order Bashing. HP/SS slash. linkffn(Pretty Boy) is also a pretty good read. Also lots of bashing and it is HP/SS slash.

  Harry runs from the wizarding world, after just two weeks at hogwarts aged 11. Running away and leaving behind the Dursley's and a manipulative Headmaster. He makes a life for himself, he was now just a normal man with no expectations heaped upon him. Then, at the age of nineteen help finds him in the form of Severus Snape or rather Harry helps him. SS/HP Slash good Sirius/Remus.
