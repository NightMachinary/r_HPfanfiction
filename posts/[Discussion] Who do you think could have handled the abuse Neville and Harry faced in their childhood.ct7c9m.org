Canon abuse, not fanon abuse.

So Neville's relatives trying to shock him into doing accidental magic.


** I don't really understand what this question is driving at. Abuse isn't something you can or can't "handle", even as an adult and especially as a child. If you mean to ask what characters could have escaped abuse or something like that, that's also a bit of an inappropriate question when talking about children being abused by the people they're dependent on. No matter how formidable they seem as an adult, I don't think there's a person out there who was invulnerable to abuse as a child.

If I'm missing the point of this completely, please let me know.

*** Harry and Neville turned out relatively normal after all they dealt with. You can argue nature vs nurture, but do you think that anyone else in the Harry Potter universe would have gotten through either of their childhoods and retained much of their canon personality?

**** I mean... part of that is JKR's whole playing-abuse-for-comedy thing. The Dursleys & Neville's grandmother/great-uncle are mostly played for laughs in the actual text, despite behavior that looks pretty abusive upon any examination. The books don't show the consequences of abuse realistically with Harry and Neville not because they're meant to be remarkably resilient, but because it doesn't show /abuse/ realistically, period (which is maybe understable given that they're books for children, but if she's uncomfortable writing about abuse realistically, I don't think she should have written about abuse at all).

Anyways, I still think it's kind of weird and inappropriate to entertain the question of whether or not different characters "could have handled" abusive childhoods. It sort of implies that anyone who "couldn't handle" being abused is in some way weaker than those who show less outward signs, or that there was something they should have done to avoid being abused. I don't think you intended to do this, but it definitely plays that way to me, at least.

***** *Shrug* I can't please everyone. I suppose it could be that way, but I can't bring myself to care too much about sounding politically correct. It was a situation, and it was handled. I can't really say it better. I'm not attacking abuse victims, but some people are more strong-willed or resilient than others.

Take a canon character with a loving family and place them at the Dursley's house instead of Harry. What do you see occurring rather than Harry's passive aggressive attitude? Do you think Hermione would have still turned out brilliant if raised by someone who was as demeaning as Neville's family?

Rowling definitely shouldn't have played it for laughs though. She does something similar with Hermione attacking Ron in book 6 and plays Hermione off as the hurt one.

**** I mean no it would shape your behavior. Even Harry and Neville turned out the way they did as a result of what happened to them. Sure their entire chatacter isnt dependent on being abused but it still shaped them like all experience would. How exactly? It would be pretty hard to say all the ways theyd be different in fact impossible. If you look at anyone moment that you are sure influenced you greatly you could never figure in exactly how many ways it influenced you. And thats just all the ones you can perceive not all the ones you dont consider.

** +...I don't recall Neville being /abused/ so much as there was trauma in his parents being tortured and institutionalized. His gran was firm, but I don't think she beat him.+

Head trauma induced garbage memory strikes again >.<

*** It's probably referring to the tidbit that Neville's uncle was hanging him out a window to try coax some accidental magic out of him and accidentally let him fall. One of JKR's casual one-liners that are meant to be humorous but are actually terrifying once you think about it.

She wasn't abusive, but him using his father's wand reeks of bad judgment.

***** I'm inclined towards the former because when she was proud of him after book 5, she got him his own wand.

I suppose you could see it as him without explicit evidence, but evidence points towards her.

Thanks for the question!

Do recall that his wand was broken during the DoM fight, so it's not necessarily a change in her attitude towards him that prompted a replacement.

****** Even if it had been Neville idea (which I doubt), a sensible guardian would have explained him that the wand choose the wizard (that one thing Olivander say to EVERY customer) and brought him to Diagon Alley to buy one.

Also, didn't Neville break his wand during the events of the MoM (explaning why she HAD to buy him a new one)?
