It's a guilty pleasure. Doesn't need to be superHarry. Bad guys have to lose. good guys end up happy. Please no goblin friends because respect..


** I'm currently reading linkffn(2345466)

It's got a bit of super!Harry, but not over the top like we tend to see, I haven't completed it yet but 3/4 of the way through and it seems to be one of those 'good guys win' stories. No Goblin-friends, though there is one friendly interaction that I remember seeing?

It is written kinda juvenile, though. If you go through you'll know what I mean.

**** No problem, have fun! I find it so hard to find fun super!character stories that aren't all "every magical creature is my friend and I have infinite money and speak all languages ever."

Fair warning, it does use one of those pesky animagus tropes.
