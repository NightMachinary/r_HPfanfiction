I hardly ever see Lavender as a main character in any fics. Like, ever. Which is rather odd considering she gets far more of a spotlight in the source material than a lot of really popular characters in fanfiction. Maybe it's because she's portrayed somewhat negatively? I dunno. Which is a shame, imo, because she's got just as much potential for an interesting story as Daphne Greengrass or a dozen other popular characters.

This seems like a /really/ uncommon pairing so I don't expect much, but wanted to try anyways.

So far I've read two fics that fit this request: Linkffn(Blue Eyed Doe, by InfiniteDragon) and (The Garden by rjacques).

Personally I enjoyed Blue Eyed Doe /much/ more than the Garden, but The Garden was still decent enough that I finished it. Only downside is that neither breaks 50k words.

Thanks in advance!

Definitely that. I'd love to read a good hurt/comfort postwar romance with Harry and Lavender (one that is not bashing every single character in the series), but because she was a Divination nutjob at 13, most authors and readers don't like her. Hell, you get downvoted here if you say that Ron and Lavender would be a good match because people see that as "Ron bashing" (oh no, a teenage boy likes the pretty girl! Clearly, this sub's favourite Weasley is above such superficial trivialities as breast size).

I have a postwar Harry/Lavender one-shot outlined, but far too much other stuff to write and too little time. Still, it is one of those pairings which has a lot of potential, but sadly goes nowhere.

*** Cho and Lavender generally get bashed in the fandom, and unlike Ron, they have few fans to defend them.

Cho might not be the emotionally strongest girl out there, but she risked her life and limb in the Final Battle, despite being unceremoniously kicked out of DA due to the Marietta Edgecombe affair and already out of Hogwarts by that point. That's good enough for me.

Lavender might be somewhat silly during her Won-Won episode, but she didn't hold a grudge against the Trio over her rather humiliating breakup with Ron. During Year 7, she braved terror and torture, actively participated in the resistance, and possibly gave up her life in the Final Battle. I think she's quite admirable.

Ron and Lavender getting together sounds perfectly fine to me, and we don't get nearly enough Harry/Lavender. She's a lot more preferable to me than that nobody Daphne Greengrass.

I would say Blue Eyed Doe fits that bill.

Some characters are portrayed negatively, but I don't know if I would call it bashing since it seems like a reasonable response to me. You may disagree with me, though. Really my only major issue with the fic is the length(I almost literally read that fic with breakfast.), and that I think Lavender was a lot less traumatized than she should've been.

I don't really like original Lavender either. The only Lavender we saw was a rather two dimensional supporting character fawning over the main character's best friend for like half a book. That doesn't really make a character many people like.

I look at canon as potential. A basis. That's part of why I like fanfiction- I like seeing these two dimensional, shallow side characters filled in. Given a backstory, a personality, and quirks. Work with what they have, and expand on it. I /really/ like that.

This! Wow! I wouldn't say he's above it, I would say it sounds fairly reasonable for him. "Emotional range of a teaspoon" ring any bells?

I don't know if I see that as a long-term thing, but as a fling or short relationship? Absolutely. Considering this is fanfiction and the characters are malleable at best, and blank slates at worst, I think an author can absolutely make them work however they want.

**** I didn't like that one because far too many characters who fought against such bigotry shunned Lavender. Especially Hermione, that had been so incredibly OOC for her.

Also, it became "True Love" too fast to be believable.

That's fair, I can see that. I had that issue with The Garden, personally.

As for Hermione, I don't think she had issues with Lavender regarding the werewolf thing, I think she just didn't like Lavender. Particularly because hearing about how someone is a whore now, then finding them in your best friend's house while the best friend in question is still grievin- It was a complicated situation, I found it a pretty reasonable reaction. And she was already quite stressed.

I do think they should've made up before the fic ended, though. And in an actual scene not a line in the epilogue going "yeah they worked out their problems. is k"

*** one of the reasons i like linkffn(7352166) Protection From Nargles and its sequel is the pains it goes to to portray Lavender in a positive light. It even has some madam puddifoot's apologia. harry certainly enjoys his time there with luna

whats so wrong with a girl wanting to get along with the boy she has a fancy for? so what if shes a bit of a stereotype or a ditz. rowling seems to be a bit mean to me in retrospect. the “my sweetheart” necklace may be a bit embarassing as a present, but her earnestness is still rather endearing

  Harry and Luna meet in the Room of Requirement. Mistletoe appears. Will Nargles be a problem? Takes place in during Harry's fifth year, as he and Luna get closer. Basically pure fluff, largely consisting of conversations. NOW COMPLETE.

** linkffn(The Garden by rjacques)

If you wanna use the same parenthesis and/or command "linkffn" for multiple fics, you should space them, inside the parenthesis with a ; like this (Test1234; Test12345)

Saves you some trouble =D

  A few years have passed since the Battle of Hogwarts, and most of Harry's friends have resumed their normal lives, but he is drifting and his relationship with Ginny has stagnated. Hermione is working on a plan to restore her parents' memories. Seeking help for her, Harry becomes reacquainted with Lavender, Parvati, and other old friends. Romance, tears, and a dash of Jane Austen.
