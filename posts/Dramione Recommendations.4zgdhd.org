I just signed up for reddit to ask this, I have been getting into dramione and have been enjoying myself for the most part I just wish I could find one a story that dealt more with the culture clash aspect, Is there a fic exploring cultural and class diffences?


** I like the pairing but my biggest problem with it is so many fics seemingly have the couple in a vacuum, with other characters only existing to either approve or disapprove of the relationship. I would like to see a fic where both characters learn about each others customs and upbringings and bond over new experiences.

** Rebuilding by Colubrina is a good one (and long). She has a few other Dramione stories, like The Muddy Princess. NJ Coffee Queen on FFN has some good fluffier stories (I especially like Moving On), and Aurelian by BittyBlueEyes is gold.

  Just another Pureblood!Hermione story. A hidden adoption revealed, a brother found, a new world to figure out: "What are you hoping for?" he asked as they stood ready to do the spell. "I don't know," Hermione admitted. "You?" His knuckles were white on his wand. "A sister," he said, his voice very low, "I'm hoping for a sister." Winner 2015 Energize WIP Awards. COMPLETE.
