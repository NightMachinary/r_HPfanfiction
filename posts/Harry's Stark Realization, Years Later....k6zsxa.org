No idea where this popped from, but it might be amusing to some people.

After he overhears a foreign diplomat at some boring function or whatever 'jokingly' mention "the Potter Administration", Harry is confused -- especially since he's a househusband or some other job that gives him happiness compared to something more high-pressured. And his wife that may or may not be Ginny? She's not even remotely involved in politics.

He asks around and he's a little horrified/baffled at what he discovers.

To the rest of the magical world, he's pretty much the shadow ruler of Magical Britain: the "real power" behind the Minister's Seat... and they're fine with it. Under his "leadership", not only has Britain entered a mini golden age, but by proxy so has the rest of the magical world.

The Minister? A good friend of his (they fought in the War together) who asks for advice about a lot of critical issues over casual get togethers and dinners.

The head auror? A friend of his who was in the "old crowd" (DA), such as Susan -- same deal with other key positions, like the Unspeakable researchers.

In fact, all his friends, family, and acquaintances hold key positions (even down to Hannah running the Leaky Cauldron!) across Magical Britain, or they make up most of the senior auror forces, and listen to him/he can call in "favours" when he needs to. And they're loyal to him.

Skeeter is terrified of his influence and resolves not do do anything to piss him off -- same with the rest of the Prophet's staff, who aren't idiots. The Quibbler? Run by Luna, who is pretty much a pseudo little sister to him at this point.

He even has light inroads to France and Bulgaria due to his friendship/family ties with Fleur and Viktor!

To outsiders looking in, it looks exactly like he placed pawns everywhere and successfully made a bloodless coup.

He managed what Voldemort attempted to be force and what Dumbledore consciously refused all those years... by accident. And since he's pretty much beloved by everyone... yeah.

Basically, he's the unknowing spider at the center of a web.

It also explains why a lot of the "darker" elements of society have been on the down and low: they're irrationally afraid of being "disappeared" (amusingly, it was Malfoy, who went the canon route of regret and was cordial with Harry, and his wife that informed him of this -- the fact that Astoria and by extension the rest of her family is indebted to him because he casually pointed the Unspeakables to research their blood curse is coincidental).

Harry... isn't sure what do do next.


** This is an utterly fantastic premise and I'd read anything - oneshot, novella, series - revolving around it. If someone picks this up, please link, because this actually sounds exactly like what would happen in real life.

All of Harry's friends and allies tend to be the most competent people shown in their generation of witches and wizards and Harry would naturally be respected for his opinions, being the wizard who defeated the most recent Dark Wizard in power. Here he's thinking that he's raising his children and occasionally doling out advice over a glass of wine after dinner, when the entire wizarding world thinks he's the shadow Minister.

Interesting parallels to the barmiest of alt-right theories in our current time as well - fascinating!

*** Honestly, I think a one shot or a shorter story would be the best bet for this. I feel like a series would get extremely stale very quickly. Like after harry finds out about this, there's really nowhere to take the prompt.

**** I'd think it would works as a series of stories. Some one-shot. Over longer.

Like first story would be when He discovers about it. Basically the prompt really fleshed-out. He asked around, discover everything that people are about.

Then, each one-shots are an instance were Harry accidently influenced the Magical World.

Like, now, Muggle studies are mandatory at Hogwarts ? (which helps in the tolerance bit)?

Well, once, Neville and Harry were out in Muggle London because Neville wanted to see Kensington Garden. Harry volunteered to take him because he'd be a nice outing with the kids.

Neville was useless and almost give away he was a wizard multiple times. And Harry jokingly said "seriously, every one should take Muggle Studies. At least you wouldn't risk to expose us the seconds you step outside the magical world".

Neville being embarassed by whatever misstep he did, find it is really a bright idea. He is a teacher at Hogwarts, and bring it to McGonagall, and they have to fight hard the Board to make it happens, but they did.

Also change the teacher and curriculum because yeah, most of it is bullshit.

And Muggle studies become a mandatory course.

And the story would be from Neville point of view, would show them their adventures in Muggle London, and then the fight to make Harry's not-even-idea-just-a-joke-taken-seriously happens.

****** Well, if one think of many instances that Harry's accidently influenced the magical world,it can go well over 50k.

But how I imagine it, it would be more like a series of one-shots, only connected by this theme "Harry accidently influence the magical world".

And it can be by a lot of different authors. And could even contradict each others.

Okay, I think my idea is more a trope or a tag than a fanfiction itself, but I think you get my drift.

** Harry paused as he walked past the group, eyeing the... was it a Norwegian representative? He couldn't tell by the accent, but if he could hazard a guess the man came from somewhere much colder than Britain.

"Potter Administration?" he found himself asking aloud.

The man startled, wand out and catching the wine that threatened to spill from his glass, directing it back in with a flick of his wrist. "Mr. Potter! A pleasure."

Blinking harshly (because there's no way he'd go to one of these damned things sober) and collecting himself, Harry walked over and took the mans hand, shaking it firmly. "Pleasure to meet you, Mister..."

"Alfsson. Sigurd Alfsson," he said, smiling broadly. "And please, the pleasure is all mine."

Harry chuckled, rubbing the back of his head. "I couldn't help overhearing, but you said something about a Potter Administration? Is there a new charity in my name that I hadn't heard of?"

The man blanched. "Oh, no- no, not at all. I just- it's a little joke, you see."

Blinking again, Harry looked down at his glass. Almost empty, probably needed another soon. "You mean like the 'In Potter's Name' thing? I mean, really, some of the jokes have gotten pretty out of hand. I swear, the other day I heard someone say my name. /My name,/ when they stubbed their toe. I think I almost died of embarrassment."

"Oh, no, not like that- or, not quite. It's silly, please."

"That bad? I've heard them all at this point, and my wife can't stop laughing at me about it."

"Yes, and congratulations on your recent anniversary."

"Ah, yeah." Harry blushed, the whisky rushing to his cheeks. "Luna's lovely, really. Absolute jokester, but that's one of the reasons I married her... so, uh- the joke, was it? Potter Administration?"

The man, pale beyond belief, threw back the rest of his wine and coughed awkwardly. "It's this... joke, you see, among the international magical community. That the... the, er- the British government is... well, really it's not all that funny."

"Oh, please, I have to know. I rate them on a scale of absurdity. Keeps me sane against the damnable fame."

"Yes, well- they say it's /your/ administration. How do the Americans say it? You're the /big cheese,"/ Sigurd blurted, spreading his arms wide. "Master and Commander of all of Britain."

Harry stared at him, then looked down at his drink. Then back up, then back down. He shook his head, staring a hole in the ground as what Sigurd said washed over him.

  Harry has some weird words on his left wrist. That must be one of those strange things that Aunt Petunia hates so much. But it's okay! He likes them.Then, it all turns even weirder. Hogwarts, magic, a Headmaster and a Dark Lord await Harry - he would prefer if they all just left him alone, thank you very much.But when has it ever mattered what Harry wants?

I've been suffering from a terrible bit of writers block/depression for the last few months and this prompt got under my skin enough to actually get something down. Hopefully it'll kick off me getting back to working on my main WIP fic.

  Response to prompt on the HPfanfiction subreddit: *Harry's Stark Realization, Years Later...* To the rest of the magical world, Harry is pretty much the shadow ruler of Magical Britain: the "real power" behind the Minister's Seat... and they're fine with it. Under his "leadership", not only has Britain entered a mini golden age, but by proxy so has the rest of the magical world.

**** To me it's a unique take. It's both specific enough to be a good guide but vague enough that people can run with it. The fact that there wasn't a bunch of fics that people can point to saying "like this?" is another point in your prompts favor.

Also, as I've been watching a lot of West Wing I like the "it's not what it is, it's what it looks like." Which is always interesting.
