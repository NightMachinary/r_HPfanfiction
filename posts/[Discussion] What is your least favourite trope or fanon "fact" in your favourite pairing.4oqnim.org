On this sub, we've frequently discussed our least favourite tropes in general. However, this time I'd like to make it somewhat more specific, with regard to tropes that are only practiced within a specific shipping community (as opposed to more general tropes like indy!Harry).

My favourite ship is Harry/Ginny, and I dislike fics which portray Ginny as being able to do nothing which can be considered to be wrong or flawed (yes, while by no means the majority of the fics I've read, it is common enough to be considered an actual trope specific to H/G). No, thank you. I need fics that provide actual character development, especially with Ginny, in order to make up for what may be lacking in the books. This is why I particularly like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11419408/1/Not-From-Others][Not From Others]] by [[/u/FloreatCastellum]]: there is a good characterization and doesn't gloss over flaws.

So, what are your least favourite tropes in your favourite pairings?

*** You mean the trope of characters declaring "We're too young to do X" when in real life teenagers never think of themselves as too young for anything?

Wolfstar (during Hogwarts): Sirius and James friendship neglected for Sirius and Remus to be the closer friends (unless they are already together, or they are hiding the fact that they are close friends.)

While both of these can be done well, they are characterization issues that I see pop up a lot.

This is the worst. I think it's probably why I prefer my ship fics to be older characters in their 20s or 30s, especially for probably-not-realistic-pairings like HP/DM. Feasibly I could see character changes having taken place such that I can suspend my disbelief for those kinds of pairings if they're older and out of Hogwarts.

Probably also because I'm now in my mid-20s, and it's just weird for me to read about teen romance. Like [[/u/Taure]] is arguing, most teen romances do occur as written (immediately think they're in love, etc), but I just have no interest in reading about that...

** I think a lot of my issue with Remus pairings is that they tend to tone down his sarcasm, his ability to be a complete asshole, and also just his comfort with taking control of a situation and being the one in charge. Also, I feel that a lot of Wolfstar fics tend to imply that Sirius is the one with commitment issues, but from what we see in the series Remus is TERRIBLE at making commitments to... Well, anything.

I agree with [[/u/lazysloth1]] about graphic sex scenes with underage people - in my own fics, even though sex between characters is written in, I definitely don't go into the graphic details, and if characters aren't at least the legal age of 16 in a fic with smut I tend to get uncomfortable.

** One thing that annoys me within the TMR/HP pairing is the time travel trope, where Harry will go back in time to kill Tom. Leading up to this, you usually see a determined person, with a plan, who's on a mission. When Harry arrives in whatever time period that just goes right out the window and he swoons for Tom's pretty eyes.

In the HP/LV pairing, they'll usually get together due to the horcrux in Harry's head which lead to them having some sort of super connection (/gasp/ sometimes they discover that it was a soul bond covered up by Dumbledore.)\\
Other times, Harry will catch Voldemort's attention because of how powerful he is. He'll learn a shit ton of magic in a very short period of time which will put him on the same level as Voldemort. This one really annoys me because I feel like it dismisses the years of learning and searching that Voldemort did and makes him less of a dangerous, knowledgable super power. Additionally, during the time that Harry is learning all of this dark magic, his whole belief system will shift, and he'll reveal his hidden Slytherin side.

** I have several pairings I like (some just for their potential), so here goes.

Harry / Tonks: Harry preferring her "actual" form. For starters, I dislike the notion that metamorphs /have/ a default form. But what I dislike most is that this is somehow the key to her heart. I can sometimes forgive this one if the rest of the fic is good, but some are just unbearable.

Harry / Hermione: 1) Harry dating his walking library, whom also took on the personality of a wooden bookshelf after becoming his girlfriend. 2) Dating Harry suddenly makes Hermione into the second coming of Merlin and Dumbledore. edit: Almost forgot: Harry and Hermione can only be together if the rest of the world is a cancerous cesspool of sloppy intrigue.

Harry / Fleur: "No reaction to allure = perfect soulmate forever" Its biology, dear reader. Veelas have no personality, desires or dreams next to them being Veelas.

Bellatrix / Hermione: Hardcore BDSM fantasies disguised as fics.

Harry / Bellatrix: The formula: Bellatrix = Hermione - Morals. If you write Bella, +give her at least a bit of crazy+ give her a lot of crazy.

Harry / Susan: Susan "I'm Amelia, but young" Bones. Seriously, if you make her a carbon copy of her aunt, let Harry date the aunt. Time Travel. Its not so far out there when it comes to FF tropes. I have another problem with this trope and its the "hyperfluffy" Susan. There are some fics out there where she reads like a human carebear, hell bent on snuggling all those baddy emotions out of Harry.

Harry / multi: Its an Ecchi. Tsundere, Yandere, Kuudere and Dandere included. "B-Baka, Harry-sama" she said blushing. Also: Harry gets a weekly supply of every porn tag imaginable, from Narcissa "the MILF" Malfoy, to Gabrielle "the jailbait" Delacour.

"Look however you want; I'll like you just the same" would be better.

I think, when I write Tonks into my ongoing fic, that she'll have a reputation for responding to people who demand she become her "natural self" by morphing into a psuedoprotoplasmic ooze beast, something like a [[http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/MM35_gallery/MM35_PG126.jpg][Gibbering Mouther]] or a [[http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/MM35_gallery/MM35_PG33.jpg][Chaos Beast]], and chanting about the Black Goat of the Woods With A Thousand Young and the imminent cleansing of humanity's scourge from the earth.

I get where they're coming from. Saying that you like a girl just the way she is, is pretty sweet, isn't it? So it /gotta/ be sweet to say to someone who can literally look however she wants. At least that is the logic I suspect behind it.

My personal bit of headcanon is that metamorphs literally don't have a default form. They come out of the womb, changing their appearance by the second. Their body forms with a image of self developing and eventually Tonks ends up looking like she does. I even wrote in one of my fics once that asking a metamorph for his or her true form is really offensive.

***** I have to half-disagree. We see Tonks's hair turn a normal brown when she's depressed in HBP, and her heart-shaped face is pretty consistent. We don't know for sure if this is a default form, but I think it's implied. My headcanon is that metamorphs have an approximate default form, and it gets harder to maintain forms that are more and more different.

I feel like the whole "natural form" thing grew out of her portrayal in HBP, where she's much less punk-rock, but it does annoy me. I think OoTP!Tonks would more likely tolerate boys who ask for her natural form, walk out on boys who ask her to look like a specific person, and like it if they were actually creative.

***** That's a fair point, but most authors get caught up making a 67 chapter book 1 rewrite and burn themselves out. Then I've invested in all their character development for nothing. If an author managed to edit their story and progresses through the younger years at a good pace, that's fine... it's just very rare, and my compromise is to read fics where the characters start out at a readable age.

It's also personal preference to a point... I'm 26, and I hate poorly written fanfiction 11-17 year old kids. I'd rather read about the characters in their 20s because I'm in my 20s.

** I would say 'lack of romantic tension' in Fleur/Hermione. There are a lot of stories that don't really seem to have a plan for where they're going, so the romance progresses quickly and smoothly in an extremely predictable manner. And once it has progressed to them sharing a bed, often in an incredibly short period of time, the author obviously has no idea where to go from there. So you just get... smutty fluff, chapter by chapter, ad nauseum. Given the previous lack of conflict in them hooking up, often by Veela bond or other twu wuv tropes, this smuff doesn't really have much impact, either. It's one thing if they've struggled for 150k words to get past each others' flaws and had numerous setbacks, and them having sex is the climax to the preceding tension. Often, though, there was no tension beforehand, so there's no payoff. Then, for whatever reason, they double down on the lack of payoff, and add even more fluff. It's... some combination of boring and sickening I can't quantify.

It's not just a F/Hr thing, but it's the pairing where I see this the most.
