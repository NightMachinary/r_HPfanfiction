Are there any fics where Hagrid doesn't take Harry to the Dursley's, and just decides to raise Harry himself (preferably at Hogwarts)?


** I remember reading one... and Molly came to the hut when Harry was about 6 or so and discovered that Harry was dressed in animals skins and covered with fleas... but I read it a LONG time ago. I did look for it but couldn't find it so I don't know if has been removed or not.

*** Oh god...I don't think that's very in character for Hagrid. I mean, he owns clothes and a home right? Shouldn't he have a bath or tub??

**** i agree that is more on the line of what Draco thought of him as a savage, not what he truly was.

***** So true. I'm pretty sure Hagrid would raise Harry like his own, and understand he's not like he's a wild animal. He's one of the kindest characters in the books and I don't think he deserves bashing smh

****** He /may/ get a bit careless about what is appropriats savety around animals for a small child, though. But I would imagine if Harry was raised in Hagrid's hut at Hogwarts several teachers would check in on the kid anyway. Hagrid would have pretty good in-build support, there.
