** canon

Too nice.

They're not good nor bad just nice. A fence sitter not wanting to hurt someone, has no conviction to things they don't care about. Claims to Care about everyone but if you "care" about everything then you care about nothing. (Or is it I'd you love everyone equally then you don't love anyone, your indifferent)

A sheep that easily get swayed

Or

(Not canon)

Too focused on something that they care about, like blindly loyal to a cause,(kinda like a cult) and will push through hard work and doesn't know when to quit. stubborn in their beliefs.

Loyal to an ideal,

Griffs tend to choose action on case to case basis sucide bombers or extremist rights activists but Hufflepuff can be the knight Templar or Spanish Inquisition that has blind devotion, repent or die,convert of die.

** Way too stubborn. Never take no for an answer. Don't understand someone not being willing to go the extra mile. Pushy. Like really fucking pushy. Bossy. Think they know time management better than everyone else. Brown nosers.

Love Hufflepuff so putting all their bad traits together like this is kind of a wow. Think Ernie Macmillan tho. That kid was a fucking queef.

*** Yeah I ditto with the stubborn. I mean think about it. If Slytherin is water, Gryffindor Fire, Ravenclaw air, then Hufflepuff must be earth. Stubborn, immovable. I suppose that could manifest as pushiness, but I think it would be more like... once they set their minds to something, trying to make them do anything other than what they want to will only make them dig their heels in.

** They all smoke weed from sprout's personal "greenhouse". In a world with cheering charms and magical potions, pot can't be that weird.

Of you don't huff and puff with the rest, you turn crazy from all the stuff that happens in the loony house that is hogwarts, start picking fights with other houses and what not. Afterwards, they control the apothecaries.
