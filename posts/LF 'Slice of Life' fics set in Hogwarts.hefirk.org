Not sure if 'slice of life' is the correct term, but what I mean is a fic which focuses more on the day-to-day things going on in a (magical) school: interactions, friendships, school struggles, romance, etc.

Stuff relating to Voldemort, Horcruxes, large-scale epic adventures, etc *can* play a part but the focus should be on what I've highlighted above (perfectly OK if its a non-voldie world too). Excessive wizengamot Lordships, Betrothal contracts, and stuff like that is a definite no.

Preferably set in the Harry Potter-era, but Marauder and NextGen fics are OK too.

As far as the Romance is concerned, I'm OK with both its presence and absence. I'm not too fond of H/Hr or H/G, and like Harry/Daphne (I know, basically OC), Harry/Fleur and Harry/Luna. I mainly read het but really, as long as it's well-written and all, I'll read any ship.

No word length preferences.

Thanks in advance!

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.
