Had anyone read g Norman Lippert stuff? It's all post Harry potter and i thought they were all really well done. He's got 5 full length books and i never see anyone mention him or them.


** It was my introduction to HP fanfiction. Man, I couldn't have asked for a better introduction. Lippert really does a good job keeping Rowling's characterization and narrative. I personally enjoyed all of his books, including the couple of spin-offs about Petra and Harry's First Christmas. I find it strange that these books are almost never mentioned in this sub. I thought they would be more popular.

** Read the first one a few months after it was published. It's one of the best fanfics ever. Though I get why it would not be mentioned often as it's not on popular fanfiction sites.
