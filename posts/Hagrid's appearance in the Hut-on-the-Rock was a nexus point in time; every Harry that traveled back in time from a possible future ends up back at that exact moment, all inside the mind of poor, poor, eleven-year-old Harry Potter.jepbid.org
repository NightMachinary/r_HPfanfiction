I'm thinking that this could be a great crack-fic, which includes a multitude of different Harrys all stuck inside the head of an eleven-year-old, possibly including Dark Harry, Indy!Harry, Godlike Harry, Lord-of-too-many-houses!Harry, Harem!Harry, Epilogue Harry, Animagus Harry, Creature inheritance Harry, and more. Honestly, I'm laughing my ass off just thinking about this. Someone write this, please.


** /The passage of time isn't a straight line; it's more of a landscape. It has its highs and lows, its peaks and valleys, deserts and tundras and jungles...yes, time does have its own biomes. And flora, and fauna, those butterflies are cute but they're obnoxious buggers./\\
 \\
/This doesn't matter to most people, of course, since the vast majority of people lack the senses to see time for what it is, and just blindly plod forward./\\
/But if you have a magical accident, or a magical on-purpose, and you end up getting flung who-knows-where in the timescape...well, firstly, the temporal you will probably end up in the temporal equivalent of a quagmire or deep jungle, which is to say, thoroughly lost./\\
/Secondly, given meta-time, the temporal you will eventually find your way out of whatever mess you're in, and locate a landmark; some particularly visible location in the timescape correlating to a particularly significant event in reality./\\
 \\
/Mount 'Harry Potter First Meets Hagrid' was a very big landmark, bigger than 'First Death of Voldemort' Sea. It was no wonder that the vast majority of Harry Potters and those connected to him, tossed through time by various means, eventually made their way there./\\
 \\
"And that's why we're all here." Scientist!Harry finished, a wave of his spectral hand dismissing the ghostly whiteboard he had called up.\\
There was a quiet pause, broken only by the crashing of waves and howling of the wind outside the shack. Several other ghostly Harrys, and one flesh-and-blood Harry, stared at Scientist (the Dursleys having fled who-knows-where).\\
"I don't get it." the 'real' Harry said, then tilted his head, "And, uh, 'Indy' me and 'Harem' me don't get it either, but apparently 'Dark' and 'God' do..."\\
"What's a God when it's a Harry?" the feather-coated spectral Phoenix!Harry quietly wondered; the sound of his voice caused the ghostly Basilisk!Harry to slowly back away.\\
"I understood it too, even if this event didn't occur in /my/ 'timeline'," Centaur-raised!Harry declared, a bit louder than necessary, "But what I don't understand is why some of us are...'timeghosts'?"\\
Scientist coughed, "Well, I hypothesize that, simply, there's only a limited amount of 'room' in flesh-and-blood Harry. Those of us here first in a meta-temporal sense took that space up, and the rest of us, whilst we have arrived here, cannot create matter ex-nihilo, hence, us being stuck in intangible forms."\\
Lion-animagus!Harry grumbled, whilst Crossover!Harry mentally pondered how to solve this one, and House-elf!Harry started brewing a kettle of ghost tea.\\
 \\
There was another quiet pause, before flesh-and-blood Harry coughed, "Harem wants to know how you tested your timescape theory."\\
Scientist blushed, "Well...actually, it /is/ only a hypothesis I came up with just now. I never imagined that something like this could happen, well, not seriously, it could take ages to come up with a spell to view the timescape if it's real..."\\
 \\
And that was when Hagrid knocked on the door. Boom.\\
"COME IN!" the Harrys chorused.\\
The shack's door slowly creaked open, and Rubeus Hagrid stuck his head through...only to stop and blink.\\
"Blimey, and I thought I had it bad." he commented, before stepping inside...followed by several ghostly Hagrids, in robes, in furs, in knightly plate...

*** I read a bit and thought, 'Now look what you've done, Voldemort, every time I come back from you killing me I drag someone along for the ride.'\\
 \\
I wonder if there's a fanfic idea in there...every time Harry is hit by something that /should/ kill him (killing curse, basilisk venom, etc), he comes back with an additional ghost in his head.\\
Growing up with a voice in his head at the Dursleys ('you mean other people don't have this...spirit guide thing'), acquiring another when Quirrell semi-kills him at the end of his first year at Hogwarts, getting a third after surviving the basilisk venom...

**** oh cool, if you can remember some titles I'd love to check them out!

For most of the ones I've read they either put him in the cupboard, often on the day of Dudley's birthday party or his birthday, or on the day he needs to get on the train, or there's quite a few who go back to fourth year, as it seems agreed that's when everything really starts to happen. There's also quite a few that happen either before or after fifth year.
