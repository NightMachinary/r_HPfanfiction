When i used to press on one of the ffnet links on the reddit app the ffnet app opened automatically with the fic in question. I recently changed my phone and this doesn't happen anymore, it just gives me options to choose from (fanfiction app - firefox - browser). I can't remember for the life of me how i had it working before. Anyone has a suggestion?

P.S. not sure about the flair


** Does it give you an option to set the fanfiction app as the default app? Or perhaps there is an option in the default manager in the settings?

** Choose the fanfiction app as the default for fanfiction links.
