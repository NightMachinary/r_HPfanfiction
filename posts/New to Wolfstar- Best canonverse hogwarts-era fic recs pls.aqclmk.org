** My favorite wolfstar story: linkffn(They're Hiding Inside Me)

EDIT: Whoops, I initially missed your AO3-only request. Here's that same story on AO3: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12540852]]

  It's the summer after fifth year, and Sirius has made himself scarce as usual. But then Remus catches a glimpse of him in Witch Weekly's special on the Black-Malfoy wedding. Something about that photo is very, very off... Turns out this is the summer Sirius runs away. Or tries to. Because the Blacks are not giving up on their heir without a fight. (Light Remus/Sirius.)

**** It basically means there's a kiss that leaves both a little confused, and nothing else. Emotionally, however, Remus and Sirius grow a lot closer in this story.

** This one is ever-so-slightly not-canon (it fits book canon but not Pottermore's Remus Lupin bio), but is amazing: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10057010/chapters/22409387]]
