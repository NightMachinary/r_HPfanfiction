For me it was Ugly by jonadark, it made me see dramione in a different lighting.


** I went into fanfiction looking for better versions of the canon romances, more depth to their beginning, a deeper exploration of the dynamics and so on. And I still like Harry/Ginny, but fanfics made me absolutely loath Ron/Hermione because for some reason, it is always written as "they express their love through fights and then have wild sex". The perfect Harry/Ginny or Harry/Hermione relationships might be boring and at times cringe, but the weird fixation on fights is much worse IMO.

I have yet to see a single fic where the Ron/Hermione relationship is believable because it basically always turns into Weasley family wank. With Harry/Ginny, you have the occasional IndyHarry one where the Weasleys are evil, but I'd honestly take that kind of grotesque interpretation of them over 57 cousins and next-gen children which add nothing to the plot and are entirely forgettable.

Tl;Dr: If you want to sell me Ron/Hermione, it has to happen without the Big Weasley family and without getting together over loss (Hermione's parents most of the time) or the stupid HBP jealousy thing (Lavender deserved better).

*** So true, I totally agree with you. For me, Ron and Hermione fanfics are always too forced! I don't read a lot of Harry and Ginny fanfics but I think that they are a great couple!

*** LinkAo3(A Second Chance by Breanie)

It takes a long time to get there(225 chapters as of the latest update and Ron/Hermione is relatively recent), but it has one of the best Ron/Hermione relationships I've encountered in a fanfic.

  What if Sirius didn't spent twelve years in prison, but was given a trial after four years? Follow the story of Sirius Black as he learns what it means to be a father/brother/guardian to his young godson & the story of Harry Potter, a young boy with a loving home who learns about the Marauders from the two men who should have raised him. M for later. Eventual Hinny.

** It's funny because I absolutely despise Draco and Snape in the books but in fics it's almost like they're different characters to me and I enjoy fics with them a lot. Not that I just enjoy them being redeemed for no good reason or being OOC but it's almost like I separate canon and fanon them to an extent. I may feel sympathetic towards them in fics but as soon as I read the books again I go back to being infuriated at them haha.

Also for some reason as much as I enjoy canon relationships (I think Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione are great couples) I don't find myself wanting to read fics about them. Maybe because I haven't read that many well-done ones?

** Very early on in my fic reading days I read a fic where Percy was undercover looking into the Ministry corruption and kept it a secret from his entire family. Part of his cover involved breaking ties and having them think poorly of him, but it was later revealed he was good. Idk this portrayal of him has stuck with me even when his character truly is a Ministry airhead. Weird how it's stuck with me all these years

** Idk but something made me change from liking HarryxGinny to downright thinking it is the worst thing he could have ever done. Still love gen 2 but I don't like it anymore. Another also changed me to a drarry fan but I was still in the phase of female Harry and hadn't been introduced to gay. I can't find it anymore no matter how much I look.

In an Instant by Eye Greater Than Three made me actually think of Regulus more because I was like “Oh he's not just some character who helped defeat Voldemort by faking a Horcrux” like he's an actual character.

*** I've read tons of fanfics that portray Regulus as just another unimportant side character but after reading a fanfic, that I don't remember now, that showed a sensitive, real side to Regulus that made me see that he is just as important as Sirius!

** The over-the-top Mary Sue Hermione trope that's frequently used made me dislike Hermione even more.
