** I can think of /Under a Watchful Eye/ linkffn(10917272 ) Very long, some really awkward bits, maybe (?) preslash (just tiny hints so far), and a kind of OOC Harry at times, but I like that the author highlights a lot of things in the stories that I totally missed and haven't seen addressed in other fanfics. It's not complete and updates really slowly, but they're into book 4 last I checked.

It's not the Order, but you might also consider /A Dramatic Reading/. It's much shorter (only reading book 1) and it's set in fifth year. It's complete. linkffn(12324284)

  Umbridge finds seven books about Harry Potter from another dimension in the Room of Requirement and decides to read them aloud to the school in an ill-advised attempt to discredit Dumbledore. Hilarity ensues. Features an actual plot, realistic reactions, decent pacing, *and minimal quotations*.

** Have you tried RoseDragonWitch's Discovering the Legend series? It was set in 5th year. Though I don't like how Sirius is portrayed here (Kind of hyperactive kid with bottomless pit for a stomach) I enjoyed it.

****** Maybe in a reading canon thing, since we all know canon. If they're reading about an AU, actually reading about what happens in the AU will be interesting as well - more interesting than the reactions, definitely, since we can sort of guess those reactions.
