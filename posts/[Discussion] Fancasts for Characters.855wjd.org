Do you have actors you see in your head when you read the series and fanfiction? Who?

If you have fancasts of characters that have little description in the books, do those things end up in your fic?

(Casting got brought up in another thread, and I thought it would be interesting to expand it and see everyone's ideas.)


** Fanfict fancasts then.

Zooey Deschanel as female Harry Potter.

** Dumbledore = Stephen Fry; tall, kind-voiced but can rouse a terrible temper. He even has a broken nose.

Snape = Tim Roth; more skeevy and spiteful-seeming, and 15 years younger than Alan Rickman

Hermione = Anna Poppelwell; the right age and has thick brown hair, with appropriately large front teeth but who shines as a discovered beauty when she grows older

Harry = Dan was good, James McAvoy could have been great but was too old for the role when cast

Sirius = I'm a fan of Oldman and felt he did great with what the scripts and directors allowed for him. The only reason I'd replace him is for a better match for the character's age; maybe Rufus Sewell or Clive Owen

Remus Lupin = Paul Bettany, again mostly to adjust for age as I liked David Thewlis' performance; then again, Remus faded into the background of exposition for the later books. If Bettany was Lupin, they might have been more tempted to include the DH argument between him and Harry over abandoning Tonks

Bill Weasley = Ewan MacGregor - because he's the 'cool' Weasley, and he won the heart of...

Fleur Delacour = Keira Knightley- almost supernatural beauty, and the right age at the time

Minerva McGonagall = Helen Mirren or Charlotte Rampling or Emma Thomson - Emma did great as Trelawney but she could easily have brought more life to the role of McGonagall (while acting like a younger version of Maggie Smith)

*** Funny you should mention Anna Poppelwell for Hermione; I was thinking Georgie Henley for Ginny. I really like your Remus, but that Fleur is a no. Elle Fanning for Fleur.

*** I definitely agree on Oldman. I didn't like what they did with Sirius in OoTP, but that was the writing and I really liked him in PoA. [[https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CCflEEOUkAA8JWf.jpg][His look in State of Grace]] was how I started seeing Sirius after he was cast.
