** Looks promising... I like the "teenage drama queen" Ginny has going on here.

Just one thing: It's "Ginevra," (Gin-ev-ra) not "Ginerva." Ginny's name is a variant on "Guinevere"... if you notice, all the Weasleys have names taken from Arthurian legends. Even "Ron" was the name of King Arthur's lance.

*** I always find Ginny's real name funny, probably because Ginevra is a brand of gin (the alcoholic drink) where I live, though it's spelled as ginebra.

*** Thank you! And Yea, I sort of knowingly switched it around, but I might change it if too many care.

**** Why change it, though? I mean, "Ginevra" fits the Arthurian myths theme they have going on... "Ginerva" comes from "Genevieve," which doesn't have anything to do with King Arthur.

***** I like how it sounds better. It sounds like "nerve" and it fits with the theme that teenage years are like one big nervous breakdown. I'll understand if no one likes that, it's just my preference.

****** But it's not her name. I just feel it's like the equivalent of making Harry's name "Harrison" because you like that better.

**** I care. It would be one of those little things that threw you out for a while, and anything that makes the reader stop and realise they're reading, rather than staying immersed, is not good.
