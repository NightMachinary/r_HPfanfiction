I say War Hero but in all honesty, anything that has him established as a crucial part of the war. Whether that's him fighting, him getting over the traumas of the war, or even him dying tragically. Thanks folks.


** Harry is a total warlord in the dark war epic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], as Fiendfyre is his favorite battlefield weapon.

In another dark war epic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], it's Hermione who first commits to total war against Death Eaters, but Harry shines in the second half.

In the Star Wars crossover [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/Broken-Chains][Broken Chains]], Harry gains Sith power and brings Hermione and Luna on board later. In its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12040341/1/The-Stars-Alone][The Stars Alone]], they were betrayed and exiled to the Stargate universe. Despite their formidable personal powers, they still face an uphill battle there.

I know Hope has that kind of Harry, in a post-war fic. I also think White Knight, Grey Queen and Blue Steel have that during the war. In general, I think Jeconais writes a great version of powerful important Harry, so here's his whole page

** Ah, this type of depiction of Harry is one of my favourite things in Manacled by senlinyu. But I'm not sure it's what you're looking for ( so I haven't linked it) because it's focussed on Hermione, and Harry has only a minor role.

**** Ok, but massive trigger warnings. The first half is a Handmaid's Tale crossover - and Harry is already dead. The second half (starting in chapter 26) goes back to the war and is the half of this fic that I really love and reread constantly. I love the politics of the war and the disillusionment felt by some of its fighters - it feels really real to me.

  Harry Potter is dead. In the aftermath of the war, in order to strengthen the might of the magical world, Voldemort enacts a repopulation effort. Hermione Granger has an Order secret, lost but hidden in her mind, so she is sent as an enslaved surrogate to the High Reeve until her mind can be cracked. Now illustrated by Avendell.
