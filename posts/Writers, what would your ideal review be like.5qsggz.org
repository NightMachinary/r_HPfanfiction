** As bad as it sounds, but just straight up positive reviews that boost my confidence.

I can't invest enough time into fanfiction to seriously apply criticism. I use it to relax and therefore also like my reviews relaxed.

But anything is appreciated, really. From a simple "Nice. Looking forward to new chapter" to lengthy and detailed feedback. Its just that the second won't actually /do/ much and I do feel bad about that.

** Well, the review that pleases me the most is a reader telling me he loves the parts I'm already kinda proud of (Helps me accepting the praise).

What I like most a reviews that actively show me how to improve the story.

** I like reviews that actually say something best. One of my favourite readers is an editor from South Africa, and she reviews literally every chapter, pointing out spelling mistakes and reacting to specific moments she enjoyed.

I love it when people actually talk about what interested them or affected them in a particular scene, or when they try and think critically about what's being implied and straight up say "I'd love to see more x" or "please could you go into more detail about y?" because it shows they're generally invested.

It's my personal policy to never leave a review under 10 words, because I don't see the point. "Love your fic!" or reiterations aren't helpful to me and don't give me any particular boost - even whiny reviewers upset that I use present tense or that I write Hermione as black are preferable to that, because at least I know they're paying attention.

When I personally leave a review, I go through rough positives and negatives, then go into detail about character, story and writing style. I embrace criticism because it helps one improve, but when I review other people I balance it with positives - I'm a member of a few casual writers' societies IRL, and balanced feedback is often hard to get hold of, so the practice is good.

So my ideal review is just any that actually shows the reader thinks and criticallu evaluates as they read, to be honest - it needn't be positive, just indicative of thought.

** Non-existent.

I accept I am very much in the minority, but I am uninterested in "reviews". If I wanted someone to proof-read I would have an alpha reader do that or use a service. If I want feedback on technique or structure, I have sought it out long before I have published a story. I know I am spoiled by the resources I have access to, but the truth is a vast swathe of people offering "criticism" have no qualification/skill in doing so.

I did a test recently with a sample passage I had professionally prepared and reviewed. Every forum, IRC, etc. I ran it through all came back with "well, you need to check grammar and punctuation" despite the fact I knew that was not the case. After reading all the concrit/reviews/coverage offered by these, I was left thinking so many people offering the advice to writers hoping to improve didn't know any better themselves and that it was most often the blind leading the blind.

I'm also uninterested in "backseat writers" offering their two cents on what they think should happen. If you want a story to unfold a certain way write it yourself, otherwise commit to the author's vision and enjoy the ride.

I accept that the general idea is that there is a tacit contract between Author and Reader. The Author provides free material, and in return, the Reader provides free feedback which may help the Author evolve and improve their technique. I just don't buy into that idea, I consume fiction generated by others, and in turn, I produce fiction as my participation in sustaining the fanfic community. I don't feel he need to review as some in-kind payment for reading a fic. So I don't, unless specifically asked by the writer, or I am greatly touched by the work.

** I love critism, no matter how rudely worded. As long as they give me something to improve on, idrc what drivel they spew.

** What they liked. What they disliked. What they would like to see happen. Often times I can easily write a small scene in to give the story a little more. Hate any corrections (mostly due to when my characters use slang) when they don't bother to proofread their own reviews...that has grammar errors and misspelled words.
