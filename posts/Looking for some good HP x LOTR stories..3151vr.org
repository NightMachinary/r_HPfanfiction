I'm looking for some good HP x LOTR stories that feature Harry paired with a girl from the LOTR universe. I'd appreciate the help!


** It's curious just how often a request for HP x LotR fics turn up in this sub. I mean, there's another one on the [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/30vis4/looking_for_a_good_hp_x_lotr_crossover_to_read/][front page]] right now that contains links to a bunch of others.

Still, you're looking for a specific thing within the crossover, Harry/LotR-Girl. That is even rarer than the basic request. Mainly because there simply aren't many female characters in LotR and the ones that are mentioned are either dead, married or get married to popular characters and fic authors seem to dislike breaking the canon pairings.

Still, there's gotta be some stuff, right?

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11027086/1/The-Power-He-Knows-Not][The Power He Knows Not]] is Harry/Éowyn. Bit of a self plug admittedly but I think it has to be mentioned for this request. Short but completed. Writing style goes a little off the rails in places in my opinion but it's been pretty well received.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10951863/1/The-Lonely-Company][The Lonely Company]] is slated to be Harry/Tauriel but never gets there. But it's pretty well written. Pity it's probably abandoned.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1357912/3/There-and-Back-Again][There and Back Again]] and its rewrite which mostly covers stuff unmentioned in the original, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4403118/2/Elda-Kundu-Kurutar-A-Wizard-s-Tale][Elda Kundu, Kurutar: A Wizard's Tale]], pair Harry with an Elf maid called Ránëwén. Unfinished and the original returns to the HP-verse far too quickly for my liking but it's decent enough.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8697214/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Third-Age][Harry Potter and the Third Age]] is a bit rushed and the pairing is dubious of I remember it correctly but there's a thing between Harry and Daeuel.

Urm. That's all I can remember. My other HP/LotR stories [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11115934/1/The-Shadow-of-Angmar][The Shadow of Angmar]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11120132/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Elves-Most-Fabulous][Harry Potter and the Elves Most Fabulous]] are planned to have some kind of relationship. SoA is a long way off and will be very much downplayed and Fabulelves is obviously a fairly cracky Harry/Tauriel.

*** I really loved 'The Power He Knows Not' It's a shame there aren't any others of that pairing. Thanks for the list, I'll have a look through later!
