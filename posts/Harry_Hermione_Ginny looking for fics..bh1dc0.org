First, sorry if I flaired wrong. I think this is my first fic request here. I know this is probably a weird and strange request, but I am looking for fics with a Harry/Ginny/Hermione romance. I have read a few, and want to know if I have read them all. I recently read a Harry/Hermione story that seemed to be going into a H/Hr/G story, but it never happened and made me want to read one again. I'd prefer stories with not many sex scenes or no detailed sex scenes, but I know that is probably unlikely so it isn't a requirement. Also, if it adds more girls than Hermione and Ginny that is allowed, but it has to at least include Hermione and Ginny. Also I am not really picky so fics of any quality are good, as long as it's not just endless sex scenes, I want a plot. Thanks. :)

EDIT: I'd prefer fics be on FanFiction.Net or Ao3

#+begin_quote
  Begins right after HBP and goes through summer. Besides searching for Horcruxes, focus is on the relationship between Harry and Hermione. They are the main characters, but it's not necessarily a romantic relationship. Some HG romance in the background.

  Continuation of Soul Searching. The horcruxes have been destroyed. The trio returns for their 7th year at Hogwarts to prepare for the final confrontation with Voldemort, with some romance to complicate things. Ship starts HG, ends ? may be HG, may be HHr

  Just before the final battle, Harry asks Ron to make sure he takes care of Ginny such that she never has to worry about the basics of life if he should die in battle. Ron thinks that's a good idea and asks Harry to do the same... see top of story
