I've read a few fics like this---a Drarry romance where they are both longing for family after the war, and they both come to know Teddy Lupin and Andromeda Tonks, Harry because he's Teddy's godfather and Draco because he is Andromeda's second cousin or whatever it is. I love this storyline! Does anyone have good recommendations? Ao3 preferred but not picky, long preferred but not picky, don't care either way about epilogue compliance. Thank you!

  “What? You---why?” Harry said.

  Draco waved an arm at the house. “Look at this place! This is where she lives!”

  Harry looked at the house. “Er, a nice three-bedroom in Croydon?”

  “Nice, that's a word for it,” Draco said. “She was living in poverty in this hovel and meanwhile Bellatrix left a vault crammed full of gold and a twelfth-century abbey. But Andromeda wouldn't take anything from me, not even for the child. So I had to get her the money some other way, obviously.”

Draco starts a relationship with Teddy in The Bucket List and also in a fic it's inspired by, Somebody to Love, but that one is kinda locked right now.

  Draco will die in six months if he can't get Harry Potter to fall in love with him. Since that's not going to happen, he might as well spend his last days working through his Bucket List. Tap-dancing lessons? Rock climbing? Poetry-writing? Threesomes? Cocaine? Getting to know his adorable cousin, Teddy Lupin? Draco will try them all! Feat. Cheerily pessimistic Draco, devoted bitch queen Pansy Parkinson, and a Harry who can't help but notice that something seems DIFFERENT about Draco, these days.Inspired by a lovely piece by khasael called Somebody To Love.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5097164][The Years Before Love]] by /Lomonaaeren/ has basically this concept. Harry moves in with Andromeda, and her and Narcissa reconnect, which forces Harry to talk to Draco. It's kinda short but it's also cute, so give it a read?

  Harry didn't ever dream he could have a family beyond the Weasleys. But then, at one point he didn't dream he could have a family beyond the Dursleys, either. He tries not to think too much about those years, but in a way, they've made him what he was and given him what he has now.
