Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why Fate thinks that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

  COMPLETE. The odds of temporal displacement were tiny, too infinitesimal to count, and yet... The Harry Potter luck striking again, he supposed. So now there's an older, wiser, more mature Harry (well, the older part's true at least) stuck in the past. And he's determined that if he's going to change things, he'll have some fun doing it. (OR: Time travel minus angst equals this.)

***** It's been 20hrs now, where's that list? lol

A Jaunt Through Time actually solidified my want of two Harry's coexcisting somewhere, it was hilarious. A Good Teacher's ending was sad though, and that ending is a bit open for my liking. Never read Shaping The Future, i'll add it in my to read list. Thanks for the recs, again! :D

** I'm not quite sure if this is what you're looking for, but from the short amount I've read of elsewhere not elsewhen, it seems like these are similar.

Chapter 17 of linkffn(9720211) seems to be similar to what you're looking for. It's the middle of a story, so you might be a bit lost, but really in a sense it's a bit of a one-shot in the middle of the story (and imo largely fluff) Not much harry with harry interaction, but there is some.

linkffn(1962685) has a good Harry switching spots with an evil Harry. They don't actually meet, but there is the dimension confusion stuff. Also, the sequel to this is a third dimension, where Grindlewald replaces Voldemort, Riddle replaces Dumbledore, and Katie Bell replaces Harry Potter as the chosen one.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Days later he awakens, magic flaring uncontrollably, his soul seemingly still in one piece. But is it? With no understanding of what has happened to him, what else can he do but keep moving forwards, forced by a fate he never wanted, fighting for a life he never got to live. And fight he will.

  The day Kiyoshi-kun came back to Seirin was supposed to be a happy one. They've got their founder, another of their mental pillars, back. At least, that was what Riko was thinking-until she came back to the gym, only to hear Kuroko-kun's screams. How will both coach and player cope with a problem that has never been heard off, especially after their loss to Touo? Genderbent!Kuroko

  Being the recipient of the Order of Merlin and also having his picture on the Chocolate Frog Cards was not a big feat for Healer Tom Riddle. As Head Healer at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, nothing much surprised him. Little did he know, his life was about to be turned upside down by the arrival of a bespectacled boy with messy hair through the Veil.
