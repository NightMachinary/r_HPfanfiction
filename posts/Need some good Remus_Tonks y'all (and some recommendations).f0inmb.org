I've probably read all there is but give me what you've got. I'm open for a reread after one hell of a week.

Bonus points if it's Canon or close to Canon.

If you've got other good stories with our favourite Werewolf also feel free to shoot.

My Favourites so far (that I highly recommend, let me know if you need links. I'm definitely forgetting some.)

Jinxed hearts; The colour of everything (late Marauder Era); The Kaleidoscope series; Chasing Grindylows; The Lantern series: "Raise your lantern high" and "be the light in my lantern" ; Moments of bliss (Marauder Era); Flying colours; Bureaucratic error; Humansplaining; Against the moon (Marauder Era) ; Everything by shapechanger on ao3;


** Have you read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16345142/chapters/42070721][Pluto]]? Series of one-shots, mostly canon (there are some recent 'what-if' chapters that broke my heart).

*** I second Pluto, it really does a good job of shining a realistic light on their turbulent dynamic. I really love the voice the author gives Tonks in particular.

The only bits I don't like are the chapters fro. Teddy's POV after they've died. They always seem way too melodramatic and a bit corny.

**** Is it bad that I can't recall the parts with Teddy? I do love a bit of melodrama though, so it probably didn't bother me!

***** Theres a few bits where he writes cheesy letters to them and stuff and another chapter where he's at school and they have portraits but he doesn't like them because they have no depth just follow him around all the time. But the one I really didn't like was a recent chapter called The Bads where he was so traumatised by being an orphan that he was like... virtually abusive to Vic? And he'd grown up having these absolute screaming meltdowns? It just seemed... obviously people do have issues and stuff when they grow up without parents but realistically Teddy would have had a pretty stable, loving upbringing so I just found it really uncomfortable to read tbh.

I reread the fic all the time because the rest is honestly written so great I just think the author exaggerates how troubled Teddy would be.

*** Yes i have actually! Its also one og my favourites. Love it although it's a bit weird to me that the chapters go back and fourth in time. Still beautiful and so well written. I so agree with the recent chapters!! Broke my heart as well! I'd rather believe this version üíîüò¢

** This is a rarity, a canon-compliant time travel fixit. The author has a bunch of other good Remus/Tonks stories, too.

** Lupin/Tonks gets much more screen time in the linkffn(Innocent by Marauderlover7) series than in canon, but it isn't the focus. It's just one part of a really long story.
