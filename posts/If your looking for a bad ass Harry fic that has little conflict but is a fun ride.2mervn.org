Check out Blue Steel by jeconais at Jeconais.fanficauthors.net it's a great story if you're just looking for something fun to read. No big character development or depth. Just good fun.


** It's on my list, but I'll wait until the last chapter goes up.

****** Chapter 1 finished. I'm loving it so far, the premise seems to be unique compared to the other stuff I've read and "gypsy magic" gets me every time.

*Going into chapter 2 I'll be interested to see what you've lined up for tasks and how the smithing element works.

** I'll check it out, it sounds interesting.

Any chance you could fix the massive typo in your subject line? It's making my eyeball twitch.

** Jeconais... That name sounds familiar. Have they written anything else?

Edit- A quick google shows the answer: A lot. The one I specifically was remembering, though was "This Means War!" Very fun story that got a little too OP and intense towards the end.

** A bit late, but link: [[http://Jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Blue_Steel/Chapter_1/]]

My biggest problem with the story was the dialog of "tori" and "romi". Otherwise an okay standard no-conflict story.
