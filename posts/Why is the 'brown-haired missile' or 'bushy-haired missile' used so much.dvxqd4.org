Like honestly, just say Hermione ran quickly so she could hug Harry. I'm seeing it more often now and it's really starting to bug me


** I've seen with most fandoms they just develop certain memetic phrases. Harry Potter has your example as well as things like "his emerald orbs"

The worm fandom has "her vulpine grin" or "her eyes crinkled in a smile"

I think it's just the authors trying to use language that flows better but not realizing that it's an overused phrase. Or trying not to use the same sentence over and over even though they're describing the same action.

Personally I treat it kind of like an Easter egg hunt, the better it blends into the narrative the more points I give it.

** Her bushy hair is always remarked upon in the books, particularly the first time each year Harry sees her. For instance, here's one from Book 5:

#+begin_quote
  then there was a loud twittering noise, followed by an even louder shriek, and his vision was completely obscured by a large quantity of very bushy hair - Hermione had thrown herself unto him in a hug that nearly knocked him flat.
#+end_quote

To go from that to missile barreling into him is a pretty easy visual step, and is evocative - and, to me, it hits the same notes that it does in canon (that Hermione's hugs, when she's excited, can hit you like a freight train). Once one person uses it, it starts to spread as people enjoy using it.

** It's just descriptive language to emphasize the intensity of her hugs. Does it get used to often, probably, but I'm not bothered enough to complain about it.

If anyone is at fault it would be the first person to use the phrase. People copy things that are memorable and then it just ends up head canon.

If it bothers you then I'd suggest moving to a different story. There are millions of them out there and in thousands of them, Hermione isnt even involved so the phrase wouldn't be there.

**** "So," said Ragnok, "that concludes the bequests to Lord Black's family, colleagues and friends. Now we come to Lord Potter, Miss Granger and Messrs Weasley. We will start with Miss Granger who has been left 10,000 galleons and the contents of the Black library."

Hermione couldn't believe this. It was a dream come true! She felt a powerful tingling surge inside of herself like her magic was on the brink of an orgasm. She charged out the door, manners be damned, and flew from the Entrance Hall of Gringotts, literally.

She realised she was airborne moments later but was too excited to care. She had the knowledge of London and was on a direct course for Number 12 Grimmauld Place. As she drew closer many would have expected her to slow down but her excitement only increased her incredible propulsion. She saw the library window approaching at tremendous speed and smashed through it like a bushy-haired missile straight into one of HER bookshelves.

Her magic, already excited beyond anything it had ever experienced in her boring, rule-abiding, authority-obsessed life, passed the point of meltdown. Hermione felt like she was bubbling with uncontrollable, painful joy until she violently exploded - destroying her library and herself in a ball of fiery white energy.

--------------

Harry and the Weasley's returned to Grimmauld Place with his Order escort only to find a smoking ruin of a room on the second floor. Harry found parts of Hermione all over the place as it quickly became apparent what had happened. "I can't depend on Hermione anymore..." He muttered to himself in horror.

As he came to terms with this revelation Harry realised what he had to do. He needed to go to Diagon Alley and start spending his fortune, he needed to make a list of all his goals for the summer (no matter how ambitious) and he definitely needed to start running in the mornings. As Harry began on his new quest for independence he realised that Hermione's incident might be the most exciting thing to happen to the narrative since he'd become Lord Hufflepuff.
