** "Rubeus" in "Rubeus Hagrid" isn't a reference to "rube" - rather, it is a reference to the colour red, part of the alchemical symbolism JKR was keen to create with Harry's three father figures: Albus (White), Hagrid (Red), and Sirius (Black).

*** I could have sworn Dudley and Vernon were types of trees. Vernon Pine and Dudley Willow. Lily/Petunia are flowers, Dudley/Vernon are trees. Fits with the whole plant/gardening theme.

**** I think she also chose the name because it was old-fashioned in a pretentious way, which fits with the portrayal of the Dursley's as tasteless and thinking that they're better than they are.

** I think this is quite common in story telling :

Take star wars, which I know little about:

Luke Skywalker - All I know is that I think he's the protagonist, he sounds like a saviuor or something due to his last name,

Darth Vader - Sounds to me like Dark Invader, I would not want to get on the wrong side of him!

​

There's even a form of this in real life. [[https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20180404-do-our-names-push-us-toward-certain-jobs]]

The most well known one is Usain Bolt.

** I feel like I remember reading something about Rowling saying that it was a common and fashionable practice for a while for parents to visit a type of seer that would help name the child with a prophetic name, but I have no source for it. My guess is that it was an offhand comment in an interview or on Twitter, but it could have just as well been in a fic and I am confused.

** Most of JKR's characters have some significant meaning to their name. Except Parvati, Dean, Seamus, Lavender etc., who hardly appear in the book. Their names have meanings, but they're not really relevant to their role.

Albus means ‘white'. Dumbledore means ‘bumblebee', although I'm not sure how that's meant to reflect his character.

Sibyls were female oracles.

Luna should be obvious; Lovegood, I'm not so sure. Doesn't seem to be particularly meaningful.

/Gild/eroy Lockhart, /Xenophilius/, Sirius (Dog Star) and all the Blacks named after constellations. Kreacher, maybe?

A shunpike is a side road used to avoid the main road. ‘Delacour' sounds like it means ‘of the heart' (so, apt for a Veela).

It's meant to sound similar to creature.

Same with the house. Grimmauld place = Grim old place.

Sirius life was a siriusly bad pun.

** I mean, it happens in real life, too. I've had a DT teacher called Mr Naylor, a science teacher named Mrs Newton, a geography teacher called Mr Ward, etc. There's an Australian Urologist named Mr Weedon, and the poet William Wordsworth. It's called Nominative Determinism or 'the universe having a really bad sense of humour'. :D
