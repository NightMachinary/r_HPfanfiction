** Hey, space them out a bit. One prompt per day makes for good discussion, but a prompt every 30 minutes? That is so close together that it doesn't give people enough time to think on them both.

**** My stance is

#+begin_quote
  having too many posted close together means that each one gets less attention (and thus less people trying to write them.)
#+end_quote

Not saying that the prompts are bad, just that with them this close, they don't get the attention that they deserve.

****** Not sure if you feel the same way as me or as 15_Redstones, your sentence is a bit ambiguous.

Though I can see that, I just personally feel like it is best to write them down and stagger them, having too many posted close together means that each one gets less attention (and thus less people trying to write them.)

******* I fixed it, thank you for the heads up. And I see your point, I just wish there was a way for staggered posts on mobile.

Although, speaking of random hilarious prompt ideas, I'm thinking of making a bot in my free time to combine a fanon trope with a canon character.

So Greater Good! Sally-Anne Perks.

******** That bot idea sounds like a very fun idea, just make sure it doesn't take after its creator too much, a daily Hermione bashing thread would lead to someone getting hurt. :P

Another idea you might consider is a more mad libs style approach?

#+begin_quote
  Blank betrays blank and love potions blank to get access to blank
#+end_quote

So it could become something like;

#+begin_quote
  Luna betrays Cho and love potions Snape to get access to The Black Lordship
#+end_quote

********* I take offense to that. My prompts are mostly my deranged, sleep-deprived musings making fun of fanon tropes.

Hmm, depends what you define as bashing. I see myself as a bit harsh, but mostly because I don't espouse her good traits. This subreddit honestly has better discussion of canon than [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]] most of the time.

I will however go after for want of a nail fics that completely change a character for the sake of plot. Seriously, for want of a nail fics do that all the time. "What if Harry asked Hermione to the Yule Ball +and Ron was a secretly a racist+?"

On topic though I did like the mad libs idea, and could probably find /something/ to base it on (despite my relative youth, I'm an old school programmer who dislikes web technology in general).

********** Hey, sorry if you did really take offense, It was meant as tongue in cheek. If you want me to never make another joke like that again just let me know.

#+begin_quote
  Hmm, depends what you define as bashing.
#+end_quote

Honestly, because it is such a nebulous term, when I don't think about it hard I define Bashing as any negative portrayal of a character. I do know on a more intellectual level that It is more about boosting or adding to a character's negative traits, but eh.

#+end_quote

So by the actual (not instinctive) definition I don't think you are a Hermione basher, everything you say is true.

#+end_quote

Agreed, that always is a bit weird. Unfortunately I have read a lot of fics like this. With my H/Hr addiction I tend to read anything that falls in my standards for readability (on a grammar and sentence structure level), so end up reading a lot of Ron bash-fics.

Edit: If you want someone to help you come up with base sentences (or even just ! words, like Fem! Evil! Bashed! Smart! Indy!) once you get the code together let me know, I would be happy to help.

*********** The taking it in offense was tongue-in-cheek as well. It's hard to convey sarcasm in text.

The explanation was for future benefit. I'm not offended at you, but there conversations are public domain.

I'd love to. I'm actually about to move soon, but yeah once I get settled I'll do it. I think the mad libs idea is genius.
