  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

*** I don't usually like when stories have the pureblood supremacists be some sort of misunderstood group just wanting to protect their culture rather than the racist murderous assholes they are in canon. So I haven't read this one as the summary sort of implies that might be the case in this story. Is it? If so is the story well written enough to read anyway, even if that aspect bothers me?

**** The Voldemort in the fic has a different reasoning than the canon one. It becomes more “magic v muggle” than anything.

She ignores but doesn't deny that her followers did bad shit but Harry likes her and finds her charming so he also ignores it.

While I wanted the reader to like Voldemort in this fic (for reasons that are probably obvious now l) it doesn't mean she isn't a horrible person.

Just about everyone in the story points that out to Harry, including a rather surprising one in chapter 29.

So while I do want there to be empathy for the Voldemort character in the story. I don't want that to excuse the actions that followed.

**** Read the story. I have dropped countless fics with death eaters and blood supremacist being portrayed as not evil fuckers.

This has elements of it but just read it. It is not only extremely well written but it is not a hand wave of why it is ok, it is never ok but the characters are not cardboard cutouts designed to push ideals, they are humans with flaws and desires and growth.

  There's nobody like her. She's smart, beautiful, and witty. Unfortunately for Harry, she's also engaged. When Fleur Delacour returns to Hogwarts to help prepare for the war against Voldemort, Harry has to manage an uneasy balance between the demands of the war and the demands of the heart. Harry/Fleur during HBP.

  Power is a fickle mistress. You court her for centuries, nourish her, shelter her from those who are unworthy, and everything is as it should be. But then, she laughs, stabbing you in the back with cold daggers of reckoning. Still, the Blacks aren't overly discouraged. They've been at this dance longer than anyone else, they know one thing for certain: an old flame never dies. AU

** I am obsessed with this story right now and have nothing but praise for it, less the occasional moments of Harry being a cunty twat. Even though the author says in book 1 that the story won't be a multiship one, I think it is hard to discard any of Aenor, Daphne, or Tracey if Hadrian ends up with one of these ladies. In fact, if any of them gets shafted (such as Katie in /A Cadmean Victory/ and Daphne in /Gods Amongst Men/), then I highly doubt I can stomach reading the story any longer.
