Basically what I pictured is a Moody who is so paranoid he created a challenge counter challenge in case of time or dimension travel.

Harry, having traveled to 4th year saves Moody early by claiming to have recognized Barty as a fake. During his meeting with Dumbledore and Moody: "I met Moody during the summer outside /Eeylops Emporium/ while eating a double /sherbet/ ice cream." "Wasn't it /rum raisin/?" "No it was /lemon meragine/." Moody then backs up Harry's version of events until they get a chance to talk.

Are there any fics like this out there? Thank you in advance


** Idk, but I would also like to read this. It'll be so fun. Does Moody trust his future self? Does Moody trust the guy his future self sent, a guy he himself currently doesn't really know?

*** If you're gonna implement someting like this, you need to trust the system implicitly. Otherwise it's useless.

  What? Why was Amelia snickering? Surely it was a good thing to have such a legendary auror like Alastor Moody as a mentor... right?

** It's not what you were requesting, but you still might enjoy Chapter 31 of /The Many Harry Potters of Little Hangleton/ by /VivyPotter/ where Harry was raised by Moody and it takes place during the Maze in 4th year.

  Also known as 'Harry and Voldemort Explore Fanfiction Tropes Together'. Different Harry Potters visit Little Hangleton, and Voldemort's the only one with much sense around here. I almost feel sorry for him. Includes Slytherin!Harry, Fem!Harry, Plothole!Harry, Flamboyant!Harry, Joker!Harry, Dark!Harry and more.
