Just reread linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom), and really appreciated how in-depth their culture is. Any fics with similar werewolves?


** Obligatory linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin)

There's 2 huge problems with the way fanfiction handles werewolves imo. The first is that no one noticed Lupin's obvious signs he was a werewolf, and the second is the trope that that werewolf rights is always seen as a "just" cause despite obvious safety concerns.

I've written about [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6i1yba/request_fic_where_being_a_werewolf_is_actually_a/][the second part here]].

Prince of Slytherin attempts to solve this problem by having the lycanthropic curse turn you into a man-eating violent sociopath. All werewolves after a certain stage of their condition give into "the Beast" and basically become man-eating savages.

Relevant quote:

#+begin_quote
  [Lockhart] turned back to face the class. "There are those who view werewolves as tragic and misunderstood creatures. They are only dangerous one night out of the month, they say. They are not responsible for their condition, they say. They deserve our pity and acceptance, they say." Lockhart's face hardened, and there was no trace of Witch Weekly's Winning Smile. "Sentimental tripe! Such misplaced compassion ignores the true danger of the werewolf. Yes, the monster is only visible to the naked eye on the night of the full moon, but it is still there the rest of the month, lurking behind the werewolf's eyes. Every werewolf from the moment of infection carries the Beast within him. Most try to fight it as long as they can. Muggles rarely last more than a lunar cycle. Strong-willed wizards can last for years, and some research suggests that infected children have a greater resistance than most. But eventually, every werewolf gives in to the Beast."

#+begin_quote
  "A werewolf who surrenders to his Beast abandons his humanity, as well as his ability to view humans as anything other than prey. Oh, he can pretend, of course. The werewolf is a cunning predator and sensible enough to feign humanity if doing so is advantageous. But remember this! A werewolf who hunts and kills on the night of the full moon will eat his prey as any wild animal would. When [The Wagga Wagga Werewolf] and his gang killed, they did so by the light of day. And when they ate their victims, they sat at dinner tables and used knives and forks!"

  Lockhart regarded his horrified class, half of whom looked physically sick. "Any questions?"
#+end_quote

Granted Lockhart is very biased against werewolves (SPOILERS hehe) but this lecture is always great.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** one of my favourite fics with werewolves is dudley dursley and the new normal where dudley is bitten because the safe house isnt as safe as hoped. an interesting point is the existence of a lot of muggle werewolves after the war. [[http://fanfics.me/read2.php?id=81213&chapter=0]]

** Actually it was Core Threads, because the werewolves there used their enhanced strength and peoples innate fear of them to their advantage.

Dont wanna spoil too much for those who havent read it yet, though.

  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.

** The fic as a whole isn't about werewolves, but the year 3 plot of linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) is about how Fenrir Greyback and his pack have returned to Britain and the terror and politics that follow. I think most people would consider it the best year of Accidental Animagus.

** If you're cool with slash, try [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1507037/chapters/3183350][Keep This Wolf]]. Harry's the pack leader, and it does touch on werewolf culture.
