:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Ok here's the sitch,

I was rereading Vichan's 'Evitative' on ao3 and i remembered another kinda similar fic and it's been killing me that I can't find it, so here's what I remember:

• Harry's in his fourth year

• Hermione doesn't want to get in trouble with Ron about the whole Triwizard Drama (unlike canon) so Harry tells her to go to Ron and stop talking to him (I think this conversation was had over toast? not sure)

• As a result, Harry's alienated from his house and begins to learn a bunch of magic

• pretty sure this is a gateway to independant/dark magic

NOT SURE IF THIS IS THE SAME FIC but i'll include it here anyway in case y'all can find that too

• Harry gets put into slytherin for his fifth/possibly sixth year and makes his roomies sign a magically binding contract to keep everyone's secrets

• the slytherins think they're getting a great deal but harry's the one hiding his dark magic/parseltongue from them and they can't tell their parents

• draco has like a Crisis about not being able to tell his dad

• I promise it's not 'Evitative' even though it sounds super super similar

​

I can't remember if there was any pairings or anything else. I know it's really vague and not all that helpful but if anyone has any leads I'd be very thankful, it's driving me nuts.

Good luck and thank you!!


** The second one is Athey's Again and Again. At least I'm pretty sure. The first is very generic, could be one of many.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

*** Pretty sure the first one is Athey's Descent Into Darkness. Got removed from FF.net for a slashy lemon. It's still on Adult Fanfiction though, just doesn't have the sequel.
