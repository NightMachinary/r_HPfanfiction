** It's hard to recommend something without knowing which tropes you've already worn out.

However, I've heard that a good story should make you laugh, cry, and think. So here's some options:

For laughter - linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions by wyste) has excellent dry humour and is packed with one-liners, plus a very in-character Snape redemption arc. The sequel is also complete, but can be skipped if you like.

#+begin_quote
  Snape's commentary on Harry's abysmal potions skills actually was good advice, if you ignored almost everything he said.
#+end_quote

And, as a runner up, linkffn(What's Her Name in Hufflepuff) is a very well done self-insert, who mostly stays aloof from the canon plotline, instead just enjoying what the magical world has to offer. She does interfere at times, but she doesn't let it keep her from having a life.

#+begin_quote
  A woman was in trouble at the Ministry for trying to illegally cross-breed pegasuses and unicorns. Well, that woman was just doing God's work as far as I'm concerned.
#+end_quote

For tears - linkffn(Grow Young With Me). It's certainly not all angsty, lots of it is fun, but parts of it really wrench at the heartstrings. Ignore the summary, though, which is misleading; to get an idea of whether you'll like it, just read chapter 1 and decide whether you like Abby.

#+begin_quote
  "Er...you know that whole thing about leaving you alone?" she said cautiously. "I probably won't. Just a warning."
#+end_quote

For thinking - I'll take a risk here and recommend linkffn(Daystar's Remix of HPMoR). Methods of Rationality is quite divisive, some like it and some hate it, so you may or may not enjoy it as a story. But it does contain a lot of food for thought; whether you agree with Harry or think he's just an arrogant little brat (and they aren't mutually exclusive), it's worth pondering what he has to say and seeing what you can learn from it.

#+begin_quote
  Something, somewhere, somewhen, must have happened differently...

  PETUNIA EVANS married Michael Verres, a Professor of Biochemistry at Oxford.

  HARRY JAMES POTTER-EVANS-VERRES grew up in a house filled to the brim with books. He once bit a math teacher who didn't know what a logarithm was. He's read /Godel, Escher, Bach/ and /Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases/ and volume one of /The Feynman Lectures on Physics/. And despite what everyone who's met him seems to fear, he doesn't want to become the next Dark Lord. He was raised better than that. He wants to discover the laws of magic and become a god.

  HERMIONE GRANGER is doing better than him in every class except broomstick riding.

  DRACO MALFOY is exactly what you would expect an eleven-year-old boy to be like if Darth Vader were his doting father.

  PROFESSOR QUIRRELL is living his lifelong dream of teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts, or as he prefers to call his class, Battle Magic. His students are all wondering what's going to go wrong with the Defense Professor this time.

  DUMBLEDORE is either insane, or playing some vastly deeper game which involved setting fire to a chicken.

  DEPUTY HEADMISTRESS MINERVA MCGONAGALL needs to go off somewhere private and scream for a while.

  Presenting:

  HARRY POTTER AND THE METHODS OF RATIONALITY

  You ain't guessin' where this one's going.
#+end_quote

And a more character-oriented food for thought: linkffn(The Path not Tread) closely examines the thoughts and behaviours of Lily, Severus, the Marauders, and related characters, recognising the mistakes on all their parts, breaking up and reconciling and talking things out and slipping up again and slowly following a very bumpy road toward becoming better people.

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

  Sometimes all that's needed for enormous differences is a small change, as small as the order of a few sentences in a heated row. Lily Evans unconsciously makes one such change while arguing with her best friend, and the magnitude of consequences her actions cause holds the potential to reshape not only herself and the people around her, but their world's very future. A What-if AU

  Harry is an elf. No, he's not a bloody house elf. He lived in a place where they had got him confused with a house elf for nearly six years. They had him doing all the chores and he slept in a cupboard. Not a particularly cheerful cupboard, either. But he's not a house elf. He's a regular elf, thank you. Come on, people. It's like you're not wizards or something. PreHogwarts, NOT a creature fic. Character study.
