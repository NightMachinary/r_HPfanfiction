Harry and Lilly escape mouldy shorts on Halloween, I am fairly sure James sacrifices himself to allow this to happen (not 100% though. I think they get Remus and Sirius and go to America.

I then think Lilly becomes a teacher at Ilvermorny and they come back over for the Tri-Wizard cup?


** Legit, if you googled "Lily becomes a teacher at Ilvermorny and they come back for the Tri-Wizard cup" the fic you ask for comes first.

**** I haven't read The Ilvermorny Champion yet, but I've read several of his other works. The Bonds of Time is the only one I'd seriously recommend tbh; while the others are good, they don't have the charm that one has (at least to me).
