Hello there! I recently published my first Harry Potter fic (not the first FanFic overall, just the first for Harry Potter) called "Wounds of the Heart" (Link to the fic below). Considering the fact that the Fandom of Harry Potter is enormous and the odds of my FanFiction actually being seen are slim I have decided to try and promote it here in hopes that people will share their constructive and civilized feedback and opinion on the fic. The fic only just started so expect many things to happen and many holes/questions to be cemented and answered. Here are a few things you should know about the fic (Do read the Author Notes in the fic as well as they contain more information):

1. The fic follows canon up until 4th year where some changes will occur which are mostly Daphne, Tracey, and Astoria's appearance and their involvement in Harry's life which means that the fic will feature AU and OOC elements.
2. Since not much is known about said characters I took the liberty to write them as I saw fit both for their circumstances and the plot of the story.
3. This actually relates to No. 2. I did my very best to avoid portraying Daphne as the typical "Ice-Queen" and "Anti-Draco and his goons" and instead wrote her to be what I'll imagine her to be: A true Slytherin (as you'll already see in the first chapter).
4. In my fic Daphne, Tracey, and Astoria will not follow their typical fandom self as you'll already gather from the first chapter. I wanted to try and do something a bit unique (as hard as it is when the fandom is massive) and portray Daphne and the rest differently than I saw in the many fics that I read and to show my version of the unknown and mysterious Greengrass and Davis families as well as put to use any bit of known information about them.

Thank you and I hope you'll enjoy the FanFiction.

** Is there a threeway pairing? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

** 1. Your prose is too florid - bordering on purple. The very first sentence has way too many dependent clauses and unnecessary descriptors that it detracts from your narrative. Simplify.

2. Along the same line, you tend toward runon sentences. As a general rule, if a sentence crosses more than one line, examine it to see if it should be two sentences.

3. Typos and misspellings. They are infrequent, but they're there.

So far, it is just clunky. You need to flesh out some of your canon changes in future chapters. Above all, type your fic in Word and use spell check and the automatic proofreading support, and make corrections as needed. Barring that, find a beta.

Good luck.

*** First of all, thanks for the constructive review! Second, I will take what you wrote into heart and will fix it once I get the chance. I used to have a very good Grammar program that helped me tremendously but sadly it is not available anymore. Do you suppose that Word will provide a good alternative? As for the beta... I have no idea how to really get one other than the Beta function on FFN that looks to complicated. Judging by your review I think you could be a great beta. That is if you are interested of course.

**** You could try Grammarly, which is a Browser plug-in. Doesn't work in G-Docs but you can use it on FFN in the document manager. If you log into the free version you can even set it to British English.

  It started as a chance encounter in 4th year that evolved into friendship and love. He loved her and she loved him. So why did she join the Death Eaters? And how does her sister fit into all of this?

** Always up for a Harry/Astoria or Harry/Daphne, not usually with both, but who knows, I might get surprised. Also this "In my fic Daphne, Tracey, and Astoria will not follow their typical fandom self" is a great incentive to read anything. The best Daphne's are the unique Daphne's.

*** Well, I understand your hesitation regarding the pairing but I can say that in the end, when the story is finished, you wouldn't want it any other way. I totally agree with you! Unique Daphne is the best and the fact that it's so rare in a fandom so large frustrates me. When I planned my version of the girls I took into account everything to make sure they are as unique as possible without hurting the plot of the story which is something that I hope was showed in the first chapter.

**** I read the chapter and wrote a review, IDK WHY but ffnet isn't accepting my reviews for the last 6 or 7 days... so i'll give my review here. I enjoyed and i'm intrigued. I'm also wondering if it will have a marriage contract. Or will Astoria be a temporary replacement for Daphne in Harry's life that will boggle up everything when it comes to light? Also, did Daph and Harry actually broke up or are they simply in limbo right now ?

***** Yeah I noticed that FFnet does that from time to time. To answer your questions:

1. There won't be a marriage contract. I am trying to avoid the usual cliches that Harry Potter Fanfictions has. Like I told you in my previous reply, by the time the story will be finished everything will make sense and the pairing of Harry x Daphne x Astoria will make sense and be explained fully without it boggling up.

2. Astoria will NOT be a temporary replacement.

3. Well it is sort of described in the first chapter but the answer is that they have yet to break up and it'll be explained in the upcoming chapters.
