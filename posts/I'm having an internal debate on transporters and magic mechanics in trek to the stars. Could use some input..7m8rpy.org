Right now, harry has not been in a transporter. But eventually he will be and i'm debating using a mechanic where transporting 'leaves' magic behind, forcing it to travel to harry at x miles per hour.

So essentially it could be "harry grasped at his wand. The enemy's mass transporter effect had caught him and now he was stuck behind enemy lines.

"He slipped into the shadows, attempting to cast a disillusionment spell on himself. The cold egg sensation was not evident.

"He stared at his hand and wand. Nothing had happened.

"'Okay, i'm trapped behind enemy lines, no where safe to apparate too and they've figured out anti-disillusionment tech. Fucking Borg!'"

Then he realizes he can't do any magic but his magitek stuff works but at a diminished level and he realizes he's a squib.

Then his magic would come back to him when he's kinda hit by like lightning feeling as magic resuffuses him.

Thoughts on the idea and how to make it better?


** Imagine if all the magic spells and effects and such were enacted by spirits that followed you around. When you flick a wand with a spell in mind, the spirit living in the wand translates your intent for others to bring about. Normally when apparating, a wizard opens an aperture between here and there, and the spirits go with him. When a transporter moves him, the spirits aren't included, and it takes a little while for them to figure out where he's gone off to. The wand and other enchanted items do what they can because they're attached to the hardware.

Lumos would work, as would the Cloak.

** With respect to disillusionment spell, it seemed to only block optical spectrum, as a Nagini with infrared vision saw right through Arthur Weasley's invisibility cloak.

Thus, Muggle thermal sights from the 20th century should easily counter the disillusionment spell, and those advanced civs should have even less problems.

Apparation in HPverse has severe limitations in terms of distance. Even Voldemort had to fly quite a while from Nurmengard before entering Apparation distance to Malfoy Manor.

*** Like the other user said, Nagini saw Arthur because his cloak had slipped off of him.

*** I thought the cloak had slipped because Arthur was asleep.
