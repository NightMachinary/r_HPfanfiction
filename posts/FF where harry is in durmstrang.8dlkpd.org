There was a fic where Harry has the ability to cross into the world of the undead and Merope and Dumbledor keep talking to him into saving the world or Voldemort. The Potters are alive and surrendered to Voldemort, Voldemort was a mentor, and I think Harry was in Durmstrang with an elite group of students? I vaguely remember Bellatrix having an avid interest in him.

The last couple of chapters were about the triwizard tournament, which featured Fleur and George, and they had to kill the rebel camps as their final task. Harry hunted down Regulus, who no one knew was alive, and he revealed his necromantic powers and killed him.

This was a great fic but I seriously can't remember what it was called.


** I believe that's the Train to Nowhere and it's on ao3. I remember reading it a few months ago. On mobile right now so can't link it properly, sorry.
