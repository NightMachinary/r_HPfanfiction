Stuff similar to invisibility cloaks, Marauder's Map, etc., where it's unique to the story and has an interesting application. Looking for inspiration.


** In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6427408][Unseen]], there's this object called a Voice Box - like the name suggests, you can take someone's voice and keep it in a box. They'll be mute until you decide to open the box and return it to them.

***** A group of monsters (the Gentlemen) come to Sunnyvale and steal everyone's voice in the town one night via a magical box, then spend the following evenings cutting out people's organs. Almost the entire episode is done without any voices from the actors, so they have to convey their words and feelings solely via actions (and some hilarious whiteboarding). Really unique episode of TV that does an amazing job of taking a handicap and turning it into a storytelling technique.

******* I hadn't watched the series until this year and watched all 7 seasons during quarantine - it holds up really well for how old it is (the sets and clothing are hilariously retro though). Worth checking out if you enjoy any of Whedon's other work (Firefly, Dr. Horrible's Sing-along Blog, etc)

The Seven-League Boots in */Alexandra Quick/*/,/ although those are a European legend popularized by Chamisso. Most of the magical artifacts in that series have some sort of real-world folkloric basis and are really well-done.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2469997/1/Imperius][Imperius]] has some cool magic items like emergency portkeys behind breakable glass and magical wards on timers. It also explores some really interesting magical interaction such as the interactions between the werewolf transformation and the imperius curse.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

** The use and concept tele-portkey in linkao3(The Debt of Time by Shayalonnie) really delights me, tho maybe slightly underused. A set of paired portkeys which linked one to the other's location rather than tied to a fixed location.

  When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner.

** In Harry Potter and the Year of Rebellion by Full Pensive, they go into a lot of detail about Sirius's old flying motorbike. They say it's really a custom broom designed by the guy that created the Nimbus Series and the Firebolt. He charmed it to look and act like a bike so Sirius could go pick up muggle girls.

**** Nah, the way it's done matters. The reveal gave the story another side character to play with. That's something the author excelled at. It also gave us a new branch of magic to explore; enchantment. Lastly, it told us more about Sirius's past and how little Harry really knew about the man before he died. The bike also plays a huge roll in the story going forward as it's given to Harry as his last gift from Sirius, set in motion before he died.
