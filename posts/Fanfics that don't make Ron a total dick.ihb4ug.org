I've recently grown tired of quite literally every Fanfiction I've read either ignoring Ron's existence, or making a character more dislikeable than Umbridge combined with Jar Jar Bunks. Anyone have any good fics where Ron is a prominent character and not an arsehole at the same time? I'd prefer it if Harry were the central character as well üòÅ


** Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past has an excellent depiction of Ron. Time travel Harry recognized that most of his and Ron's issues stem from Harry not being open with Ron about his life with the Dursley's. It's just a great story all around. Harry gives more trust to Ron and he becomes more secure and disciplined.

** Linkffn(Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay) - I'm currently reading and enjoying this fic quite a lot.

Linkffn(A Stricken Lament) - okay, Harry's not really the central character, but he's still very prominent, except when he's not.

Linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn) - the trio is in Slytherin, I don't really remember much of the story because I wanted to wait for the sequels, but I definitely enjoyed it and I'm pretty sure Ron played a big role.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backward with Purpose Part I: Always and Always]], linkffn(4101650): Harry, Ginny, and Ron time travel from a very dystopian future.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6989327/1/Children-s-Crusade][Children's Crusade]], linkffn(6989327): 4 years after the war, a Hermione from another dimension is asking for help. The Trio and Ginny enter the breach one more time. Its prequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6884267/1/Stop-All-The-Clocks][Stop All the Clocks]], linkffn(6884267), depicts the last moments between that dimension's Ron and Hermione.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994): A dark war epic. This Hermione forms her own guerrilla group after Year 5 and becomes a very effective killer of rank and file Death Eaters. But Harry and Ron are not slacking off either, as they will come into their roles later in the story.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] happens in a sci-fi universe with superpowers. It's a long completed story with 600+k words, goes through all 7 years, and mirrors canon events loosely. The last year is significantly different though. It has my favorite Romione relationship among HP fanfics.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(10595005): Ultimate takedown of the atrocious marriage law trope. Ron is the true hero in this Harmony fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106): the most popular fic on this sub by a wide margin. This ‚ÄòHarry' initially didn't take Ron seriously, but changed later.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877): Lucius Malfoy won in 1981 and Dumbledore had to go into exile. Harry was raised by Sirius in France, abnd went to Beauxbaton with the Weasleys. In 1999, Ron volunteers to go spying in Britain, where he meets a loyal Malfoy enforcer, Hermione.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): Betrayed again by the establishment after the war, Harry decides to take things into his own hands. Ron and George, not Hermione, are initially his most resolute followers.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16036310][Soup-pocalypse and the Great Curry Cataclysm]] by SquadOfCats - Draco/Harry, super funny story where Draco's Veela gets all over everything. An all-time fave, and my tags are more extensive than the author's. 104k, but worth every word. It's Draco-centric, but I also have it tagged with "competent Ron"?

‚Äã

Ooh! A really good one is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/880454][Need to Know]] by saras_girl (6k). It's actually Draco/Harry, with Ron's POV the whole way through--not a combo I usually like, but it's great. Really sweet, and less humor/over-the-top than the other two. There's also a great [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16036310][podfic]] by sisi_rambles that I've listened to as chill background noise more times than I'd like to admit.

‚Äã

ETA that I was thinking of the wrong story. I'm pretty sure this is good, but it's not the one I was thinking of, oops. I just have "Ron" as the tag, and if I remember correctly that's a good "Ron" tag, but I'm not 100% sure. Oops.

  Long-distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances, but Harry and Ginny don't have the luxury of living normal lives. Their relationship is put to the test when Ginny returns to school and Harry stays behind to continue his Auror training. Ginny soon realizes her greatest challenge may be in coming to terms with Harry's fame and dangerous line of work and deciding if she can make the sacrifices needed to be part of his life. Sequel to Starting Over. (COMPLETE)

In all seriousness though, he's more secondary than main character in our fic, starts out kind of mean but there's reasons, Harry is one of the mains, and we have good plans for Ron in future. Have a look at our genre/tags though to see if the rest of it's your cup of tea. If not, I won't mind. :)

  Terror and destruction seemed inevitable after Voldemort finally revealed himself to the Wizarding World but, at Hogwarts, Harry lives a disturbingly unchanged life. He exists in parallel to the people around him and, as time passes, the line between friend and foe stretches into a complex gradient, difficult to decipher. Seeking desperately to become the hero the Order needs, it becomes more and more clear to him how dangerous that prospect is.But, in a life fraught with crisis and tragedy, what's just a little more?
