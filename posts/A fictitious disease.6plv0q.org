Could someone help me with an idea for a fictitious illness? One that leaves anyone with a broken heart, such as that fictitious disease of losing one's memory whenever one sleeps. My creativity sucks

** Here is my imaginary disease. Feel free to use and/or change anything you like.

Morgana's Memento Flu is a disease commonly found by teenagers and young adults. It is a highly infectious disease which spreads by negative emotions. (Only to people which dwell on negative emotions). Some believe this spread is based in accidental magic but this has yet to be verified.

When infected, the disease will drain memories during sleep which will be permanently gone. The disease has limited intelligenge and systematically destroys memories to change the behaviour of it's host. It desires to cause its host and others to have negative emotions. To infect others, it is known to drive the host to do drastic things like picking fights and commit suicide.

Although the immune system can fight the disease, there are several methods to improve this. Potions like a dreamless sleep potion can stop memory loss. This reduces the disease's ability to affect it's host. Unfortunately, those potions can be addictive and are therefore not used extensively. A pensieve is sometimes used to counter memory loss. However, this is a difficult and time-consuming process.

EDIT: Changed the wording a bit.

** The failure to have short term memory converted to long term memory during sleep as seen in "50 First Dates", and even shorter spans, like in "Memento" are not fictitious conditions. It is also not the result of disease but is rather caused by an acquired brain injury which affects the memory centre of the brain.

Are you wanting to make up an illness which causes a broken heart in its sufferers or are you wanting only those suffering from a broken heart to be vulnerable to catching your disease? Your request isn't very clear.

There is in real life a disease referred to as "Broken Heart Syndrome" it mostly affects women and is usually triggered by emotionally stressful events like the death of a loved one or a breakup/divorce. This combined with presenting with similar symptoms to a heart attack is how it earned its moniker. Perhaps much as we have chicken pox/small pox and the wizarding world has dragon pox you could create a magical equivalent to Broken Heart Syndrome.

**** I had to look it up. Lol it's takotsubo (cardiomyopathy) so you were only a single letter off. According to the google "Tako tsubo, by the way, are octopus traps that resemble the pot-like shape of the stricken heart." Hmm TIL.
