Any fics where an immortal/MOD Harry stands watch over his descendants and gets reinvolved in the new World!


** Fics with this sort of vibe:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8446057][On A Pale Horse]] by Hyliian. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. Ancient Mod!Harry meets his younger self. Ao3

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10709411/1/][Basilisk-Born]] by Ebenbild. Time travel fic where Harry gets thrown back to before Hogwarts, then lives through the centuries to the modern age. WIP. FFNet.
