** *I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For*

Star Wars crossover. Harry is the Master of Death and its hinted that hes basically ancient at this point. Like, a few millenia ancient. Story starts after Ahsoka Tanos trial for treason and her banishment from the Jedi Order.

I like this story a lot. It has its weaknesses, of course, but all in all its very good fanfiction.

***** linkffn(I'm still here by kathryn518) completely agree, just finished it today and I read The SW x-over last week or so. Really enjoyed both but they are very slow. I think three or four chapters take place over about 12-18 hours at one location.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

** linkffn(Broken Chains by Darth Marrs)

This meets all of your criteria (no slash, Ginny, length, etc), but I feel a warning is necessary regarding the OOC-ness of Harry & Hermione. Harry is a Sith Lord whose only weakness is something he hasn't tried yet, Hermione is 'naturally' Dark because of /course/ she is, and Luna saves them both from their more savage instincts because the author wanted Lunar Harmony. The storytelling is above average, but it's full of OCs masquerading as canon characters.

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.

** linkffn(Child of the Storm) Surprised no one has mentioned this yet. Massive multi-crossover done right. James Potter is Thor.

linkffn(The Observer Effect) TonyxFem!Harry pairing that I adore. No idea when it will update again though. The author wants to finish the story before she posts the rest.

linkffn(To Master The Dark) Harry gets trained by Bane from The Dark Knight.

linkffn(What Happens In Vegas) Fem!Harry goes to Vegas with Tonks and Remus and they predictably get drunk and hook up with the Teen Titans.

linkffn(Stubborn Shadow) While kid!Harry fics generally aren't my favorite, as kid!Harry tends to be useless while everyone else solves problems and coos over him and is generally boring, I suppose I should give this a mention as this kid!Harry is not quite so useless.

Harry now has a father, a family and a heritage that is going to change the world.

*** This story is unbelievably dense. It's over a million words in 25 chapters. I stopped reading at around chapter 20 when I missed a chapter and had a ridiculous amount to catch up on. It's just way too slow.

It's also outrageously harem-y.

It's pretty fun, so give it a try. But don't be surprised if you burn out on it.

  Dumbledore watched Dawn and Harry carefully. He could see the slight glimmer in her that he had seen that day in the Leaky Cauldron, that he had seen once before, fifty years earlier during a journey through Czechoslovakia. He knew that those blessed with second sight, or mad men could see the Key. He sometimes wondered which category he fell into. Many had accused him of both over the years. He himself wasn't sure.

  Fifth year, Harry's been banished into a painting by the despicable Umbridge. Now he has to find a way back home, and the only way he can do that, is by finding the scattered jewels of the Wizard's Crown. Can his new-found friends help him, or will being with them end his life and chances of ever getting home? Based more on the LOTR movies than the LOTR books.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.
