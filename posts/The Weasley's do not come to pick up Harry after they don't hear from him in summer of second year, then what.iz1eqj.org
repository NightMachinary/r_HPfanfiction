** Linkao3(Say a Prayer) does have this as an initial divergence point and managed to end relatively Bashing-Free (though be warned that the Dumbledore of the story behaves much more as the one from the movies rather than the one from the books).

** It depends on how you want to play it. It gives them a out not believing the living conditions of Harry. On face value based off the books the Weasley family did nothing to help Harry when the kids mentioned something.it changes also how Harry goes shopping for his supplies that year. Who picks him up McGonagall or hagrid again? If he goes himself what's stopping Harry from lying to the Dursely family and stating he needs to take everything with him and staying in the Alley the rest of the summer?

This change could change multiple things storyline wise and gives a author a way to keep first year intact then add things like a lordship or the Potter's will being sealed. This could actually be a way for the author not having to bash the Weasley family. Basically until the rescue and saving Ginny at the end of year two the Weasley family is a non entity in Harry's life. You can have Harry grow his friend circle out year two by simply meeting other students on Diagon Alley in a non school setting.

Bringing up the wills or lordship things again, maybe have Harry get some sort of check up that summer and find the Horacrux in his scar. Maybe St Mugo has a way to remove it. How will the removal change year two and beyond? The hospital could hand over the problem for the unspeakables and maybe the Gringotts curse-breakers. You both have select people looking for Volldemort's anchors earlier you have Harry without the ability to speak to snakes year two. With that does Ginny die or do Harry and Ron give the information to someone and is done with the chamber?

*** How would he do any of that locked in a room being fed through a cat flap? Without Ron and the twins he wouldn't get out until the school sent someone to investigate.

**** Maybe write a scene with accidental magic destroying the door or cause I them to investigate after Dobby goes to privet drive. Maybe Harry convinces Dobby that the only way he may not go to Hogwarts is if Dobby let's him out of the locked room. Have Harry mention people will question why the boy who lived doesn't come back to Hogwarts. That frees him to do whatever he wants after. If Harry goes back to Hogwarts you could even write Dobby as a secondary antagonist for year 2 with Dobby seeing Harry as just another wizard lying to a house elf.

You could even have Harry showing the paperwork for used magic and Harry stating he has to go to the ministry with all his things. Would the Dursely family know that he's lying?

*** Not completely, but the Horcrux plot line went somewhat similar to this in linkffn(The House of Potter Rebuilt).

Though it would spare the Weasley's of the bashing it would put even more bashing on Dumbledore's plate.

  A curious 11-year-old Harry begins acting on the strange and wonderful things he observes in the wizarding world. He might just turn out very differently, and the world with him.
