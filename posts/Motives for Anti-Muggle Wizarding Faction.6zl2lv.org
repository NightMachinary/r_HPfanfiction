Let me begin by clearly stating that this is an incomplete thought. It just sort of struck me and I wanted to share my theory.

Here's the question: Why do many Pureblood families and the Wizarding Governments act so biased toward Muggleborns?

Here's my answer: Fear.

Dating back years ago, wizards and witches were persecuted and burned for their special powers and talents. Naturally, they formed their own, secret societies to protect themselves from death. Fast-forwarding through time, this fear turned into resentment and hatred, but pure blood families (wealthier, politically powerful ones) are well-educated as to why muggle borns should not be integrated into their society. It is NOT because they are inferior, or tainting the magical world, although certainly some pure bloods feel this way. Rather, it is because the more people that are brought into their world, the higher the risk of a leak. If there is leak, wizards and witches will be at risk once more.

These fears have existed for a great deal of time, but popular figures such as Albus Dumbledore, and other researches that aim to prevent disasters caused by untrained magical people walking around, are against policies that stop muggle born wizards from entering magical society. Now, this sets the stage for a man like Tom Riddle to walk on in and take advantage of these fears (which run centuries deep) to wage war and gain power.

Some Death Eaters: Wizards who are against muggle born wizards and witches because it increases the risk of discovery (and, consequently, death). They would rather the magical populace die out over time.

Opposing Factions: Want to take in, train, and integrate muggle born magicals to achieve greater heights and prevent disasters. Are against laws and policies that persecute a specific group of people (who are in the majority, too).

Thoughts to add to my incomplete thought?

Obviously a great deal of the Death Eater terrorists seem to be racist/ biased because of blood superiority. This is me proposing a compelling reason -for some- to join with this faction.


** Take a moment to consider the muggle vs Magic quality of life. It might be about equal. Do the comparison for 1700 or whenever it was the Statue of Secrecy was signed. Simply put magic made them better. They had better lives, longer lives. Lives with more learning in. The further you go back the more stark the contrast is. For millennium magic has elevated these people above the muggles. That's a lot of history. Only very recently has the quality of life become near equal.

If we remove the blood purity aspect and look at Racism and the role of Women then the magical society comes across as relatively enlightened. We never hear anything about race and we know that they had female ministers for magic in 1798. It wasn't until Thatcher that Muggle Britain had a female Prime Minister. Sure the blood thing is discrimination and we can't excuse that but at the time the muggle-word was/is just as bad if not worse.

The fear thing doesn't hold up when you know about flame freezing charms. However the superiority aspect, take a moment and think about what the muggles were willing to do to each other on the suspicion of being magical. They're barbaric. Its not hard for them to say they're better than that. The fear aspect, if there is one is more likely to feature into what effects muggle-borns would have on society rather than fear of the muggles. They created weapons to destroy cities. Thousands dead instantly. Its brutal and savage. They have no respect. If duelling is a big thing then you can assume manners and the way you fight is important. Muggles fight without honour. It might be effective, it might win but its awful. Keep that attitude out of our world they might say. War of terror, attacks on the population, horrid things, things that Voldemort might argue were to be used against them.

Simply put until very recently there were very few aspects of life where muggles were on par with Witches and Wizards. Generations of being superior is likely to bleed into attitudes. Some of the things muggles have done to each other are horrifying and you want none of that in your world.

*** Those are some very good observations. I hadn't thought about how magic has kept them ahead of the game for so long. I still do like to hope it wasn't all hate, though.

**** It doesn't have to be hate. In fact the majority of anti-muggle sentiment might not be hate. Even Mr Weasley is condescending towards muggles. We look at Apes using tools and thing that they're getting quite clever. We don't hate them. We're just above them. Someone trying to give them the same rights as a human however would cause controversy. Some would flood in pointing out that they share this planet with us but most would say that we're still better than them. Just imagine if the apes could speak English and every now and again their child was human or close enough that most people declared it so. Think how you would look down upon someone who chose to breed with them. If magical thought themselves above and separate from the rest of humanity then this isn't too far off.

The hate comes from when people start telling you they're better than you. That you should change to be more like them. That things you know and love, that your ancestors knew is all wrong because the others said it is so.

Maybe in the past, but in canon we can see that purebloods have a sense of superiority over muggles. They literally don't believe there is anything to fear. And it was mentioned that no actual witches were killed during witch burning since they just applied a flame freezing charm.

The biggest and most compelling reason is bigotry, and being able to feel like you are better than others.

*** It would be still annoying if barbaric and superstitious rabbles wanted to torture me and my people to death. Regardless whether simple countermeasures existed, not everyone could cast a freezing charm or they could be caught off guard, and our children would be especially vulnerable.

Children might be protected by accidental magic, but it was unreliable and definitely not a get-out-of-jail-free card.

**** This. I hate how people always assume witch burnings did no damage. And even if it was stated that they did close to no damage, would they truly want to bring fear into the hearts of children? By they, I mean history books/newspapers.

****** Exactly. Or they could catch them(probably children) and use them for experiments. Even now in 2017, our society/government would probably do this.
