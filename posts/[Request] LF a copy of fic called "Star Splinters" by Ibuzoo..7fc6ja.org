No longer on FF.net or AO3. Not sure why as I couldn't find anything on the author's tumblr as to why so I don't really feel bad asking for it. Tomione pairing.


** She initially wrote it as original work and plans to publish it as such in a short story collection.

*** Oh neat, do you know the time frame that it will take to come out? Is there still a way to get a copy and perhaps pay her directly for as much as her short story collection would cost? I wouldn't be paying for her fanfiction; I'd give her money as a patronage/gift for her current writing.
