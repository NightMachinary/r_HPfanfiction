i would like to know, if there are Fics that contain Hermione is happily with Ron, but then meets a Person (preferably an OC), that she gets interested in. This interest grows into attraction and she develops feelings for him. They eventually end in Bed. Hermione is during the whole Time split, because of her Feelings. She loves Ron, but also this other Man, dont want to lose them and dont know, what to do. She dont mention that she is already in a Relationship, so the new Man assumes, she is single.

It doesnt matter, if Hermione has her Epilogue family or if this happens during the 19 Years.

It would be tempting, if she sleeps yet multiple times with her new Love, after the First Event, before her double Life is revealed.

It also doesnt matter, if he is a Muggle or a Wizard (a Muggle would be interesting and in a way more reasonable, since the whole Magical World would know who of the Trio is dating who)


** Males? Is this David Attenborough looking for fanfics?
