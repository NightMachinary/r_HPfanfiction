The Vacilation and Obduration are one of the best fics ever written about the Malfoy family.

The author religiously follows the books, describing Lucius as the man he is without being an abusive father and husband, and Narcissa as a loving mother, but genuinely believing in the ideals of Death Eaters and her husband.

I can only advise you to read this story because I noticed that it is much underestimated.

Believe me at least 70% of the people who read this story will love it or at least won't be able to remain indifferent.

For those who want to read Obduration directly to go straight into the Goblet of Fire, you will surely understand everything but the Vacilation allows you to understand the 1st Wizarding War, the birth of Draco, and Narcissa's relationship with Lucius and Bellatrix.

The Vacilation is mainly from Lucius's point of view while Obduration is from Narcissa's.

** I'm obsessed with Vacillation. Haven't yet started Obduration because I don't want to torture myself with waiting for new updates.

These are honestly the best Lucissa portrayal I've seen and I'm just so in love with both their characters. I love that they're honestly...terrible people with terrible worldviews, but within those worldviews, I find so much room for relatability and empathy, especially with Narcissa.

No fair, btw. When I posted about Vacillation on this sub around the time it was first finished, I got so much hate for it :(

*** It is one of the best Lucissa ever posted ! I've been looking for this kind of fic for months!

I spoke with the author multiple of times and you can see that he/she knows Harry Potter very well.

Everything is canon and it is going to be really interesting I think. I have always dreamt to find a fic where Lucius and Narcissa are portrayed as they are...

It is perfect, she portrayed the Goblet of Fire perfectly. It is so clever....
