hey y'all! I've been stuck reading the same five Severitus fics over and over again and while I really enjoy the dynamic of the Snape and Harry slowly realizing that the other isn't the great asshole they've built up in their mind through forced bonding because of ~plot reasons~, I'm not really sure how to find other really phenomenal ones. A lot of the ones I've found through the Harry Potter & Severus Snape tag on AO3 don't hold up to my expectations after reading That Awful Boy. I'd appreciate any recs you guys have!! (I'm not the biggest fan of fics where Snape is actually Harry's father, not a huge Snily shipper since I honestly read Snape as super queer-coded, so it's hard to wrap my mind around)


** Hey, I know of so many great ones, but the one that springs to mind that I absolutely adore is oh mine enemy. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3514260/1/O-Mine-Enemy]] I know you asked for recommendations but just out of interest what are the ones that you keep reading? I may, or may not have read them and I'd love to add more to my list.

*** Thank you so much for your reply! That's so funny, O Mine Enemy is one of the ones I keep rereading! I'm not sure if you've already read these if you've read O Mine Enemy but the ones I keep going back to are Crime and Punishment by mlocatis on ffnet, but they're on AO3 under melolcatsi if you have a preference (their other on-going fic, Snape's Promise and the completed Mors Certa, Hora Incerta are also very good). That Awful Boy and it's on-going sequel, the Pauper Prince by paracosim on AO3 are amazing! TAB is the fic that got me into Severitus. It's probably my favorite Snape centric fanfic of all time, can't recommend it enough! Word Up by ValidEgo on ffnet has a really interesting beginning and plot but it's also unfortunately not been updated since 2007, so if that kinda thing bothers you I would avoid that one. I know I said I don't read Snily as a rule of thumb but Never Say Remember by Malora on ffnet is so good that I read it anyways! Where the Heart is by silver_fish on AO3 is a very sweet one shot if you like reading those. I'm sorry for only putting the name and author of the fics and not the links but I'm not sure how to embed them in here without creating 5 of those link comments and I figured that would be a bit much. Happy reading!

** How do you read someone whose whole story and motivation is canonically loving a woman to be "queer coded"? It sounds like you just tossed everything away to see what you want.

*** When you're ignorant of the possibility of being bi or gay or anything queer just because you love a woman you don't get to say "you just tossed everything away to see what you want" anywhere else than at your own person.

Of course Snape is queer-coded. Remus literally teaching Neville to dress a man as a woman to humiliate him (painting him as transphobic) and Snape wearing his mother's clothes only to be mocked by Petunia are strong clues to Snape suffering his affiliations with femininity.

*** hey friend, this is actually a very nuanced conversation that I doubt I'm going to convey very well through a few comments on Reddit. If you're actually curious as to how Snape could be considered queer coded, I have several links to some more in depth explanations than I myself could probably provide you. All of that to say, there are tons of different readings that someone could have of the books, having different interpretations of a character is expected. I can read Snape as queer and you can read him as heterosexual, there's nothing wrong with that. I'm also going to say that I'm a queer women so this isn't about me trying to justify my yaoi ships or anything... Here are the links I talked about:

[[https://professormcguire.tumblr.com/post/183856191029/harry-potter-severus-snape-as-a-representation-of]]

[[https://www.google.com/amp/s/severusdefender.tumblr.com/post/190622229345/snapescapades-snapescapades/amp]]

[[https://www.google.com/amp/s/deathdaydungeon.tumblr.com/post/140946583243/reading-snape-through-a-queer-lens/amp]]

But if you don't read them, the basic spiel is there is no canonical evidence that he was IN love with Lily, there's none and even if he was that doesn't mean he couldn't be queer, bi/pan people exist. JKR rather heavily relied on western villain coding and stereotyping when writing Snape in order to create that whole red herring affect that lasted until The Prince's Tale. Western ideals of what villains look like or act like are often queer coded or ethnic coded and JKR is no less guilty of that in Harry Potter. Saying that, I don't, and many other people don't, think Snape's queer coding was intentional or that JKR wrote him as a queer man, but simply wrote to stereotypes without considering all of the implications. Just the entire thing with JKR putting him in women's clothing several times throughout the books, he's the only male character that this is done to. The whole implication of Sirius calling him Malfoy's lapdog.So forth and so on, I did say that I'm not the best at articulating this argument and that your best bet was those links. I'd be more than happy to continue to talk about this, if this comment was in good faith and you're actually curious about how you could read Snape through a queer lens. Hope you enjoy the rest of your day or night,

** There's a super long and in-depth series where Snape adopts both Harry and eventually Draco called A Year Like None Other by aspen in the sunlight.

I'll be the first to admit that looking back I have some issues with the series (especially book 3), but I've re-read the first story multiple times. It's definitely my comfort fic, especially for Severitus

  Terror and destruction seemed inevitable after Voldemort finally revealed himself to the Wizarding World but, at Hogwarts, Harry lives a disturbingly unchanged life. He exists in parallel to the people around him and, as time passes, the line between friend and foe stretches into a complex gradient, difficult to decipher. Seeking desperately to become the hero the Order needs, it becomes more and more clear to him how dangerous that prospect is.But, in a life fraught with crisis and tragedy, what's just a little more?

** While it is technically a bio fic Snape is gay in Digging for the Bones linkao3(598019) and is Harry's father because of sperm donation as James was infertile. It's one of my favourite Snape and Harry fics, and the author has other good works too.

  Rather than allowing Harry to stay at Diagon Alley after he blew up Aunt Marge, the Ministry sends Harry back to the Dursleys. Harry returns to school after a terrible summer, to find that he's not the only one with this kind of secret. A student has been killed by his family. New screening measures are put into place by the Ministry: Every student must be given a medical exam and interview to look for child abuse. With Dumbledore facing an inquiry, Snape is entrusted with the task of making sure EVERYONE receives one. Answer to the "New measures for screening abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. The first chapter contains a character death and the whole story is quite dark. It begins at the beginning of Prisoner of Azkaban and is AU thereafter. Also note: this story is a "Snape is Harry's biological dad" story. This is not supposed to be the central theme of the story, but people have gotten annoyed that I didn't tell them at the beginning. Another note: There are no pairings in this story, or explicit sexual content. There are, however, mentions of homosexuality. Since there are no pairings, there is no slash content, but if the mere mention of homosexuality offends you, read something else.
