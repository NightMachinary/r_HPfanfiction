Reading some HHr stories I noticed that some of them follows the same pattern: Hermione did something really bad towards Harry like hiding his baby, lying him, taking their friendship for granted for long time or something like this, but during their reunion Harry forgives her instantly or almost instantly. I became tired of such stories and I looking for an advice from the community.

Could you please recommend some good stories where Hermione behaved like this, but Harry didn't forgive he or she had to really earn his forgiveness and trust?

Thank you!


** One of my favourite fanfictions, was a story about Hermione leaving the campsite with Ron, in the Deathly Hallows (there was another, where she accidentally disparates with Ron, which wasn't quite as good). It was never completed, unfortunately.

*** I found this fic to be weird. First, you have Hermione, who isn't one to play around with romance in canon, suddenly playing hard-to-get. Then, you have Harry angsting himself half to death, which somehow gives Voldemort access to 4 Privet Drive, so then Voldemort kidnaps him, sets up a /stage/ in Hogsmeade, and executes him in front of a crowd, pointing out how it's all Hermione's fault.

And, the weirdest implication of the whole thing is that it's apparently Hermione's /obligation/ to return Harry's feelings. Consider: in the fic, she was playing hard-to-get, but suppose that she genuinely did not love him. Since only she would know that, /everything/ in the fic would proceed in the exact same way. So, no matter what she feels, the only right answer for her in this fic is "yes".

**** Pretty much this. The premise of the story is a train wreck: Harry effectively commits suicide because his target of affection says, and I quote, "I'm not really looking for a relationship at the moment... I'll always be your best friend. I'm just not looking for a relationship."

Harry's is a pathetic response to an entirely reasonable statement on Hermione's part. Consider: his revelation comes just before the start of summer (they won't see one another for months, making the logistics of a relationship trying at best), after she'd received serious injuries that had left her hospitalized, all while Harry is processing his grief over the loss of a close family member. Hermione properly recognizes that at this point in his life he needs a friend more than anything, not a lover. Besides, they're all of 15. Few relationships at 15 work out and a stumbling romance would no doubt get in the way of their friendship.

Were it not for the "fuck with his mind" revelation on Hermione's part in the next scene (which hands her an idiot ball for no reason save for plot contrivances), everything she did just prior would have been fully justified for a levelheaded adolescent, i.e., canon Hermione.

** I havent read such a H/Hr Fic yet O.o The only one is that with the "Hiding Baby" Fic, which i read some time ago...Hermione gets pregnant by Harry, but she cheats on him with Ron and after Years, she tells her Daughter, she has a Father (who isnt aware of this), so she wants to meet her Father. Harry is the Owner of a Restaurant....and yes, he forgives Hermione far to fast, like many user comments say in the Reviews. However, as i said, i havent read any Fic, aside from this, that Hermione behaves in that way. On the other side, i give effort to read H/Hr Fics who are written close-canon with different changes (Notebooks and Letters, for example).

Are you looking for H/Hr stories with this way or general Hermione meeses up with Harry? Maybe "Fulfilling Obligations" is a Fic, you will like too? linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4418163/1/Fulfilling-Obligations]])

  Did you ever wonder what happened in the 19 years between the last chapter and the epilogue of Deathly Hallows? Or what happens afterward? Totally, completely, and eventually H/Hr, but we have a long road to get there! Rated T for language & sexuality.

*** Thank you for the recommendation. Unfortunately I don't think “Fulfilling Obligations” is good for me.

I looked reviews to get a grasp on the plot. It seems thus story is close to the ones I mentioned initially. The only difference is that both Harry and Hermione are villains deceiving their corresponding spouses. And the author makes a lot to justify their happy ending.

**** yes, its one of those Drama Fics, that follows the Canon and has Harry and Hermione secretly loving each other (possibly having an affair) and dont have the courage to tell their Spouses (so much for Gryffindor, eh?!). I dont like these Fics, despite the good H/Hr moments in it, because they hurt and betray those who love them. The ones who are to pity most are their children.
