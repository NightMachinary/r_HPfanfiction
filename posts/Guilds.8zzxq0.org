I was wondering how would guilds work in HP. What would they do exactly would they be like Mercenaries?


** Maybe craftsmen, enchanters, and potioneers? They could pay a small fee to the guild and gain various benefits and support in return.

** I think guilds could work pretty well in HP. You could have a wand maker's guild, for example. They would have a guild master (probably Ollivander) and regulate the trade and use of woods and cores and debate the merits and feasibility of introducing new ones.

The banking guild would be dominated by goblins, but there's potential for drama when a wizard becomes determined to break into the banking business.

A broom-maker's guild, a potions guild--all sorts. If you've read any Discworld books, Guilds are very important and include a Thieve's guild and an Assassin's guild. There's also the Seamstresse's guild, which ... well, may not contain women who are very good at sewing, but good at other things.

*** Wand-maker's guild seems unlikely to me. Remember that the Wizarding World is a tiny, tiny place. There is only one major native-British wandmaker, Ollivander's, and he meets demands quite adequately; and everyone who's dissatisfied with the Ollivanders for some reason can go to Gregorovitch of Kiddell.

**** Wands are so important to witches/wizards that having only a single elderly individual in possession of all that critical knowledge seems foolish even for the wizarding world. I think it's more likely that you're overlooking how easy international travel is for magical humans (e.g. Elphias Doge's 19th cen. world tour) and how a guild wouldn't be restricted to just British members.

***** An international guild would make sense, true. Pratchett or Pirateaba Guilds are usually single-city affairs, hence why I didn't consider it.

It's worth nothing that Ollivander's isn't "a single elderly individual". Wandmaking is a family trade and Garrick is no exception: he canonically has at least one child and grandchildren, to whom he has taught his wandlore, and who are expected to take over the shop if Garrick ever retires, or dies, whichever comes first.

That we know of. Maybe there's one in Ireland or Scotland serving their local communities? Maybe some young upstart determined to make their mark in the world. Can you imagine being a witch or wizard living in Dublin and having zero access to magical services in your area? You break your wand and you have to go all the way to London for a replacement? Ugh.

To me, it's never made a lot of sense that the center of all magical commerce would be in Diagon Alley in London. What a pain in the ass for Irish or Scottish magical families to have to make the trek down to London for school supplies and then again for the Hogwarts Express.

***** I think you forgot that wizards have multiple ways for instant/very fast transportation.

Wizards have no real reason to shop locally when they can get better quality elsewhere and reach it in the same amount of time. And we know that apparition, floo travel and the Knight Bus are all avaible for travel between London and Scottland.

That's an impossible premise right there. Any wizard worth their salt has the Floo, and/or a broomstick, and/or an Apparition license, and/or an owl to conduct the transaction with Ollivander's remotely. It would take a particularly inept wizard to be stranded just at the loss of a wand, and even then it would also have to be a completely antisocial one who can't call on a fellow mage to call the Knight Bus for them.

****** But what about the whole "wand chooses the wizard" thing? I agree, a lot of other things can be done remotely, but wand purchasing specifically seems to be a very hands-on process. I dislike Amazon very, very much and I much prefer to go to a brick and mortar store to evaluate things for my own self. If I didn't have local stores, I would be up shit creek. And what about the shut-in witch or wizard? There are a lot of things that having the bulk of wizarding commerce centered in one area don't take into consideration.

******* We're talking about an adult wizard who broke their wand --- and also one too cheap to take the Knight Bus or buy a Portkey, and too magically inept to know how ti Disapparate. A wand of the same size, wood and core as the wizard's original will most likely be /adequate/ even if it's not a perfect fit, and that should be good enough for this Ebenezer Scrooge we're supposing.

** They'd probably be structured more like medieval guilds mixed with the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livery_company][Livery Companies of the City of London.]] - meaning there would be members who don't actually practice the trade but are in for some other political or financial benefit.

  A guild is an association of artisans or merchants who oversee the practice of their craft/trade in a particular area.
#+end_quote

I think you overestimate the excitement of trade negotiations. Most guilds, even for magical stuff, would deal with "normal" items such as magical tools, cloth or books. Any guild for illegal activities seems like a stupid idea because it makes it very easy to arrest the members and/or find evidence.

I mean, I find the exploration of the magical economy and products interesting, but I doubt that you have that in mind.

*** Presumably, OP is influenced by Terry Pratchett's guilds in /Discworld/, which have been surprisingly influential in modern fantasy; he made it a running gag that there are far-reachign "guilds" for just about everything, including assassins, in his world. And off the top of my head, /The Wandering Inn/ has prominent, plot-relevant Couriers's Guild, Adventurers' Guild, and Mage's Guilds (though obviously those particular examples couldn't quite apply in the Potterverse).
