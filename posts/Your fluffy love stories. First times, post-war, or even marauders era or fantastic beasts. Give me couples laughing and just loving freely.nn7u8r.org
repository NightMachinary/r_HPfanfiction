I'm not really into slash unless it's truly mindblowijgly excellent and prefer the general sense of /connection/ and companionship a couple shares as they live in the moment. If it's funny or silly snapshots of a couple's life, I am /into that/ right now. I want to be smiling from ear to ear. Come to think of it, it can also be just be awesome friendships, Fred and George would often lend each other well to such a role. Just give me your happiest, joyful /living the dream/ fics, please, I am having a fantastic weekend and I want to bask in happiness.

** It's just little drabbles of Harry going on Dates because I had writers block. They fit into my other Harry Potter story but arent required reading. Please let me know what you think

** This is primarily a story about the deep, loving friendship between the trio, but it also has established, comfortable Ron/Hermione. I think it fits the vibe of what you're asking for. :)

  They have Shepard's pie for dinner. Ron and Hermione watch Harry fill up his plate and only start serving themselves when he picks up his fork and starts eating. Neville laughs into his wine glass.“How are you dealing with their mothering, Harry?” he asks.Ron opens and closes his mouth for a minute, groping for an excuse. Eventually, Ron says, “He's just so small, Nev.”“Hey,” Harry says. “I'm seventeen. I'm an adult.”Ron shakes his head at Neville. “My best friend is an infant.” A curse regresses Harry to his seventeen year old self, physically and mentally. He doesn't recognise this strange peaceful wizarding world, but there are two people he does recognise: Ron and Hermione. Based off this tumblr post.
