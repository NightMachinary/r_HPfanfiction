One of the best fan films I've seen yet. By MuggleFlix. I know it's not fanfic but definitely worth a view.

*** Late response but I highly recommend checking out /”Voldemort - Origins of the Heir”, “Le Maitre De La Mort”/ (French with English subtitles), and “Severus Snape and the Marauders”* which also has a follow up podcast called /”The Great Wizarding War”/. All of these are really great fan works and a good change of pace from fan films and pure canon. Those films are actually well done and “Origins” got a decent deal of media attention.
