Is it just me or do most pairings have their own established, rarely diverging layouts? For example:

- Harry/Ginny: Canon +, missing scenes, Happy Weasley family, occasionally Hermione bashing to "prove" the OTP. Ron/Hermione in the background.

- Harry/Hermione: Either Canon with a different love interest, bashing/IndyHarry or a counterpoint family to the Weasleys. Sometimes Ginny bashing to "prove" the OTP

- Harry/Fleur and Harry/Tonks: White Knighting, Harry is the only one who sees their "true self"

- Hermione/Malfoy: Ignores any and all characterisation of Hermione and whitewashes the Death Eaters, or at least Draco. Ignores the war crimes he commits in canon. Ron bashing to "prove" the OTP.

- Harry/Daphne: Harry discovers his "Slytherin side", bashing

Obviously, there are exceptions to this rule, but I feel like there are certain story archetypes for each pairing.

Your thoughts? Any other archetypes you can think of?


** - Any Hogwarts student/Snape: Angsting over moral acceptability of the pairing, Snape turned into a Byronic anti-hero archetype, then once the student turns 17/18 and Voldemort is dealt with, relationship closure whose overall happiness depends on the tone of the fic.

- Anyone/Tom Riddle: Angsting over moral acceptability of the pairing, then acknowledging that teen Tom may not have perpetrated genocide yet (depends on what you call the Muggleborn petrifications). Also that he's hot, and that teaching him love can turn him good. Likely involves Cursed Child-level Time Turner plot devices.

- Remus/Sirius: Mixed signals miscommunications in coding their respective sexualities for months or years. After the big confession, they turn into Harry's adoptive and loving dogfathers who don't put up with the Dursleys or Albus' shit.

******** hmm, IMHO cynicism doesn't mesh well with romanticism. Maybe Snape was a romantic pre death of Lily.

But you are right in regards to potions. On the other hand it's pretty hard to argue that this is somehow his last refuge since it's so closely related to his service to Voldemort and Dumbledore. I find it hard to imagine that Snape still indulges in his love for potions in the same way that a true romanticist would.

** I can only speak for Harry/Ginny, and I can say that it's not like that, really. There isn't much Hermione bashing, she's more often the really good friend. Ron bashing happens more often. Happy Weasley family, sure, but often times the author makes the Weasleys hate Harry because they don't want to actually put an effort into creating tension. Then there are also the soul bonds, Ginny's quidditch club acting like a concentration camp and never letting her out of the facility, let alone allowing Harry near her, and of course the teenage pregnancies that everyone in the story for some reason is ok with.

** The 2 most common ships I read is HGSS and LESS.

HGSS has 3 common plot options: Marriage Law (/why/ this is as common as it is is beyond me, some kind of fic challenge?) with the 2 going from despising each other, or at the very least being unfriendly, to coming to a reluctant truce, that ends up somehow developing into love (never liked this kind of fic much, it trivializes marriage and is generally rather unrealistic -- the far more realistic result of forced marriage with forced copulation is mutual /hate/). Or HG meeting SS some years after the war, they become friends, SS being redeemed in HG's eyes, with similar interests that eventually becomes something more (my personal plot preference). Or HG returning to 6th year of Marauder era (landing earlier puts her on collision with LE, and it's easier to avoid that issue alltogether by landing after the fallout), befriends him and turns him away from his Death Eater housemates, redeeming him. Their love develops for somewhat similar reasons as the former, only with more Death Eater issues. (There is also an even more common plot: teacher/student fluff, but that's something I avoid reading if I can because it's usually just smut)

LESS has 2 common plot options, both flawed IMO: Peggy Sue after Nagini back to 1971 (pre-Sorting) or 1976 (preventing the catalyst for the fallout), and SS disassociating himself from his Slytherin housemates (and avoiding Slytherin alltogether if he arrived in 1971), finds new friends (usually with LE's help) and creates his own circle of friends, sometimes bashes at least some of the Marauders, and in the end they start dating (my main issue with this plot is Marauder bashing and that SS turns into a "good" person much too easily, and -- when returning to 1976 -- their friendship being much firmer than it realistically should be at that point). Or LE surviving the attack at Godric's Hollow, and SS takes full advantage of it, reconciling the dead friendship and eventually have it turn into something more over time, usually with Dumbledore's help (usually the way fics go about this makes LE basically use SS as a rebound after JP's death, which generally makes for an unhealthy pairing). I much prefer plots where something happens before the fallout that forces the 2 to resolve their major issues, rebuilding their friendship (they're supposedly /best friends/) and it eventually turning into something more from that without needless bashing or otherwise, but that's an uncommon setting.

The original challenge was based on the premise that SS was a pureblood and Muggleborns were forced to marry pureblood for population reasons and HG was the targeted Muggleborn. I think the prompt had something about Lucius interfering also. This then evolved the MLC to Hermione/anyone to any pairing. The MLC blew up in popularity, so it makes sense why it's fairly prevalent in the ship.

EDIT: link to [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/WIKTT][WIKTT wiki]]

As for Snevans, those are the two most popular options but it feels like once you've read one Peggy Sue fic, you've pretty much read them all, with a few notable exceptions. I have the same problem with most of these, because SS ends up being way too nice and whitewashed considering he is a 38 year old Death Eater Professor in a teenage body. I enjoy a lot of variations on the time travel format, with Snape and Lily both being transplanted into their younger bodies, Lily being the sole time traveler, etc. I don't really like the second plot option - it's too self serving and not very romantic to me.

My favorite plot option (along with a well-executed Peggy Sue) is having the two still maintain a friendship or repair it in Hogwarts and beyond. These feel like the more natural version of the pairing.

**** Ah, so the reason Marriage Law plots is common /is/ due to a challenge. Interesting -- it explains why a plot that would otherwise probably be rather obscure is as common as it is.

I've only read a single Peggy Sue Lily LESS; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4797089/1/The-Law-of-Unintended-Consequences][The Law of Unintended Consequences]] -- are there others? It was a nice refresh on the typical LESS Peggy Sue.

The first is both LE and SS being Peggy Sues. In the second LE travels forward in time to kick off the story. These are two I remember off the top of my head

  Severus wakes up in the afterlife expecting something rather different than being almost-seventeen again. Seriously, what kind of game is this? But wait - Lily's come back, too - from 1981? Perhaps it's a second chance... but to do what? SS/LE

**** Yes, but I've only posted the first half quarter of my first chapter and the reviews were bad; they were cruel to me. So I aint posting anything new until I have atleast 5 chapters ready. I'll also be editing what I've posted. Its riddled with cliches, so I'mma have to work hard to get those out.

Anyway the the first chapter is outlining Harry's vacation in France. He meets Fleur. She don't like him. He don't like her. She has a fiancé. The plot will be a slowburn romance with a chapter of a kidnapping mixed in to traumatize them.

Now I aint pulling any rabbits out of the hat. Rescuing is done by aurors. This is the second chapter. Recuperation and falling in love. Yadda yadda yadda. Harry goes back to England. He goes to the world cup. Death eater attack. Harry goes to Hogwarts.

Chapter 3- lol I aint telling.

Anyway if u liked the plot, I'm gonna be real happy. If not then that sucks I guess!

***** Okay. So the premise is interesting, but it does raise a number of questions right off the bat.

1) AU nature of the world / ages of characters Harry vacay in France cool. How old is he? Has the GOF happened? Will it happen? Is the war with Vmort gonna be a thing? Fleur and Bill's relationship if there is or ever was one?

If it is a world where there was no GOF or FleurxBill that makes it easier, but has to be established clearly

Since you are taking it a through canon: the burn better take years because 14 year old Harry shacking up with an engaged Fleur/ having time to interact meaningfully will be hard to buy.

Now if the tournament is kicked up a notch and leaves the competitors increasingly traumatized so they all start to drift together to cope together and that leads to rocky relationship for Fleur and the foundations of something with Harry I could buy that.

2) How are you going to handle Allure? If it becomes a white knight Harry story it will be less enjoyable. If all the characters are old enough that men in the story have grown a bit more self controlled and able to resist the allure by virtue of not being in the midst of puberty then kudos.

3) Fleurs old relationship has to fall apart. This can happen for lots of reasons but make it good/realistic. I probably won't buy the fiance cheating leading to a break up. That tramautic event needs to be in such a way it results in Fleur and her Fiance no longer being able to communicate/connect like they used to.

Just my thought on what you have shared. Also try to avoid the rape cliche. Having them beat her or threaten to or actually cut off a finger to mail with the ransom note with the kidnapping would work.
