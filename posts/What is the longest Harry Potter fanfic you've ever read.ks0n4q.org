** Another pretty long one that I read is blindness by lomonaaeren. Harry gets stuck by the killing sites across the eyes and is blind. Aunt Petunia is nice and raises him equal to Dudley. Very good definitely recommend

***** Because of the pronunciation of hermione the middle mio when you say it out loud sounds like maya not Mia. The spelling may look similar but the pronunciation is different.

** Either Alexandra Quick or Pureblood Pretense, they're both sitting at around 1.3M words.

The longest fics I know of, but haven't read, are the Sacrifices Arc and the Gray next-gen series, both of which are at 3.1M words.

** That has to be 'By Baker Street Station, I Sat Down And Wept.' 555k words at this point, with both Harry and Dudley as Snape's children (solid IU reason given), incredible world building, and Petunia developing magic herself. Also, minute dragons.

I did have to take a break 3/4 through reading, though.

** It depends on how you count. The longest fic I've personally read is linkffn(The Long Road Home by Penelope_Muir). But I've also read linkffn(Fate by TheTrueSpartan), which is far longer. However, back when I read that fic, it was only around 500k words long, not 3M like it is now. I don't think I'm going to re-read that fic...

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Mary Sues, no Character bashing.

Even for the heady days of 2008 it was terrible, but like a trainwreck I couldn't stop reading it.

** Before I gave up on the story (it was good, but I wasn't familiar with the anime it was crossed with), I got 145 chapters into [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10727911/1/Black-Sky][Black Sk]]y, which currently sits at 334 chapters and 1,359,813 words. The longest HP fanfiction I know of, which I have no intention of even starting, is [[https://boxnovel.net/57645/a-bend-in-time][A Bend in Time]]. I have no idea how many words it contains, but it currently has 620 chapters.
