*** At least you gave it a try :). It's important to have your own opinion about such a divisive fic, I think.

I know of another fic that does a really good job - perhaps a better job - of exploring rationality and good/bad thought patterns, without the self-righteous and overconfident protagonist, but it's not HP, and it's incomplete (steadily updating on the first of each month). linkffn(Pokemon: The Origin of Species by DaystarEld).

#+begin_quote
  Enter the world of Pokémon from a rational perspective. Instead of starting his journey in ignorance, Red has spent his years studying the creatures so central to his world... and he doesn't quite agree with all the information in his books. No time for rookie mistakes here: he's on a quest to discover the true nature of Pokémon, and maybe even find out where they really come from.

Another thing I've seen in slash stories that I don't care for is the author making everyone gay or lesbian. Well, perhaps not /everyone/, but I have seen stories in which the author claims that 20% of the population is gay, and writes accordingly.
