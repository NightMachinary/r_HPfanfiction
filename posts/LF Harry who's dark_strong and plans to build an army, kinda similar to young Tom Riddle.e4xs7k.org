I wanna read Harry who follows the steps of Tom Riddle to fight Tom Riddle. Snape mentioned that several of the Death Eaters wondered if he could be a standard around whom they could rally around once more. I want to read something that expands on this potential.

Harry as a strong wizard (doesn't have to be necessarily dark) who builds an army to fight Voldemort. Also, I'd prefer if it doesn't have bashing, despite the fact that I can already imagine, to my displeasure, unnecessary Dumbledore bashing in whatever I'm about to read.


** It is an unfortunate fact that most of Dark!Harry fics are written by teenagers (either in body or spirit) filled to the brim with angst, and 99.99% sure to fill the thing with bashing so I won't hold my breath, still...

** I think this one fits your bill. The fic is ongoing and has an amazing arc going for Harry. With his rising influence, rituals, and politicking, Harry Potter is making a mark in the wizarding world. It is one of my favourite ongoing fics right now.

#+begin_quote
  A disillusioned Harry Potter begins to unravel his potential as the wizarding world follows the Triwizard Tournament. Harry delves into a world that is much greater, and more complicated, than he was aware of. Story contains more detailed magic, politics, and more. It is a story of growth and maturation.

**** Author of fic here. I've not commented on the final pairing in the fic once in a definite manner. There are political reasons some are advocating a multi situation but Harry decides his own path and nothing is definite, that a reader would be aware of, at this time.

** Oh I almost forgot, I found this a few days ago, I'm still reading it but is probably the first time I read a Dark Harry fic without Dumbledore Bashing (so far, I'm still in the early chapters) and they start an early DA (Defense Asosiation... Yeah) to counteract Voldemort that is similar in structure to the Death eaters (they call the core members "inner circle"... which given the circumstances doesn't actually make sense, but I understand that it was to accentuate the similarities between Harry and Riddle so I overlooked it)

*** Might have to give it another go. The constant POV changes threw me off when I tried reading it a few years ago. I don't mind the occasional chapter with a different POV, but the amount of changes used in this was just not my thing.

**** It is actually what I like about it when you have an overpowered main character, one of the best way to narrate them is actually from another character POV in my opinion

  They expected him to be a paragon of virtue, a champion of the Light, the personification of all that is good and noble in their world...they were wrong. Explore the legend of a darker Harry Potter, seen from the eyes of friend and foe alike. Multiple POVs. Non-linear narrative. Rated M for violence.
