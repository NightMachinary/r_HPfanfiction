I remember that the fic started at the end of the second year, where Canon Harry goes to sleep and awakens in a room with several other Harry's. One raised by Sirius, several Slytherin, Ravenclaw, etc. I remember that the Harry that pulled all the others didn't have a scar and couldn't find Hufflepuffs Harry alive after second year. Someone remember this fic?

I tried to find it but it seems to have disappeared from my favorites.

Thanks!

** I remember reading this, I cant find it but I do have some stuff to add that I hope will help.

The Harry that organized it all was actually the son or at least raised by Voldemort. Our harry had some private study sessions with him where they talked about ethics.

everyone had nicknames so that the harry's would not get confused, I dont remember anything but one of the Gryffindors being called Gryffin.

Anyways hope this helps someone

  “Welcome to the first Interdimensional Harry Potter Meeting!” Harry wakes to find himself surrounded by seven other, very different Harry Potters. He's about to learn more about himself than he ever wanted to know. Premise: I've read many stories in which Harry's life takes a turn at some point along the way and he becomes a completely different kind of person. This story explores several of those while focusing on Harry as he was in canon at the culmination of the 1st book. What if JK's Harry Potter were to discover prior to 2nd year exactly what his own potential could truly be? What if he had found unconditional acceptance and support to guide him on paths he'd never imagined? What if, at the tender age of 12, he had discovered unrestricted access to a deep well of information Dumbledore had never meant for him to have? I give you The Harry Potter Self-Help Group...WARNING: This is a Work In Progress. It is not finished, nor may it ever be finished. It is presently at around 35,000 words. I will post what I have written and add more if/when I write it. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.

** Makes me think of an inter-dimensional Potter & Potter School for Harry Potter. Where various Harry's get trained to do what needs to be done before their first year.

"Oy yea new guy. You're over here. Pick a name for yourself while you're waiting. We're all Harry Potter but can't choose that one."

"If we're all Harry..." Harry asked while looking over at a small group of girls.

"Yep. Don't think about it mate. Just... don't think about that."
