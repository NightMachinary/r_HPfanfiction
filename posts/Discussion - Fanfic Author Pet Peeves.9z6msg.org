What are things that Fanfic authors do that drive you crazy? One of my big was is recaps from the last chapter. If I need to remember what happened last time, all I have to do is hit the back button and I can read the last few paragraphs, I don't need you to recopy them at the beginning of the next chapter. And since I usually try to read only completed fics, I am not waiting months between chapters.

Another is when an author 'chats' with the character as the disclaimer.


** Lots of authors have annoying things they do with names. Like the constant use of insulting nicknames even when it doesn't fit the story (e.g. a super political fic that has Harry referring to Umbridge as Umbitch in front of the full Wizengamot), random switching between first and last names, having every adult ask small children to call them by their first name as soon as they meet them, etc. Getting stuff like this wrong really can harm the flow of a story. Naming conventions should be consistent within the story and with the tone and theme.

*** I do a thing where, depending on the situation between the characters, I'll use either first or last name in a scene. For example, in class, I'll use ‘Professor McGonagall' or ‘Professor Snape' or ‘The Headmaster/Professor Dumbledore'. If it's outside of class in certain settings, for example when a character is friends with their Professor or former professor and they go for tea, they would use the first name. It's consistent, but changes with circumstances. Not really explained very well either. Don't judge me.

**** As long as naming conventions are internally consistent with the situation and storytype I'm completely fine. Using nicknames or some term of abuse in certain fics is fine. I expect it to happen in a crackfic. And if you have established certain relationships within your story it's fine to use first names (although in my opinion the ease at which professors and other adults ask kids to call them by their firstnames is entirely unrealistic).

But I've seen fics where there is no established (friendly) relationship between Draco Malfoy and Harry, but he still refers to him as Draco while referring to other classmates (that are closer to him than Draco) by their surnames. That's inconsistency that annoys me greatly.

***** “I'm gonna tell this 11 year-old to call me by my first name on our first meeting because that makes so much sense!!” No, I'd expect ‘call me Minerva.' In 7th year, maybe 6th, as in the senior years when they're almost adults and on par. We called a number of our teachers by first names in our senior years, but never would have dated before then.

********* It's a nickname phenomenon. Barry = Bazza, Harry = Hazza, Robert = Robbo. The way we give ‘nicknames' they'll usually end in ‘a' or ‘o'. We also use the system for places, foods and times. McDonalds = Maccas, Avocado = Avo (often consumed as smashed avo) and Afternoon = Arvo.

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

** Anything longer than two or three sentences before or after new chapters. Plus, I don't really need to read the disclaimer more than once per story. And stop replying to comments in those spaces - I haven't read the comment in question, I won't read it, and if I find myself interested in some sort of discussion about plot points or whatever, I write a comment of my own, read others or search for some sort of discussion platform the author uses.

​

Also, some people use ridiculous strings to separate scenes. Since I tend to have my pc or tablet read ff to me while I am busy with household chores, it's very irritating when the computer voice suddenly starts to repeat strange acronyms or random characters ad nauseam. I don't mind using some stuff to make a scene separation clear, but I think just a couple minuses or something similarly short is enough.

​

Oh, and another pet peeve: Long explanations about the authors private life. Even if I do read a story before it's completed, and there has been a long break, I prefer a short "Sorry, had IRL stuff come up" or "sorry, next chapter(s) will be delayed" to something lengthy which just distracts me from the story. I've enough trouble happen in my own life, I don't to borrow someone else's.

*** Actually what's in the fic is not what I am talking about, I am talking about things that Authors do at the beginning and end of chapters (and sometimes in) when they make notes that they think are cute, Spending the first page of a 3 page chapter 'arguing' with their characters as a disclaimer or answering reviews at the end of a chapter. Or putting (ha ha) in the chapter as if the character looks at you the read and snickers before going back into the story. Those kinds of annoying things.

​

A prime example is Bobmin's disclaimers that are moronic and are usually two pages long, while his chapters were fairly long, the disclaimers really dumbed down the story sometimes.

**** Disclaimers do not have any legal meaning. If the original creator would want to sue you, he'd simply do so. I understand that Rowling is in fact fine with fanfictions as long as they do not have adult content (sex).\\
So, at least for Harry Potter, writing a disclaimer that you do not own it, is unnecessary.

**** Disclaimers like that were kind of A Thing when a lot of Bobmin's fanfiction was written. Most of his big stuff was 8-10+ years ago (jesus christ that makes me feel old).

And a lot of older fics did the answering reviews thing in the AN's because they literally *couldn't* just message the reviewer to answer their questions or whatever.
