I know we've all had our bad fanfic experiences, so I'm curious about one specific thing.

What was the best story you read that was ruined by the plot twist that ruined the whole experience? (i.e. Made no sense at all, was way TOO random, or was utter bullshit?)

Mine was when I was reading an awesome Wolfstar raising Harry book...

...The last two chapters feature us finding out James and Lily was still alive and ignored Harry for NINE years and expect them to be accepted into the family.


** I once read a sweet Charlie/Hermione story...only for the writer to have Hermione run off with Snape in the LAST CHAPTER. I was furious because the story was tagged as “Charlie Weasley/Hermione Granger”.

** I was reading one once where Harry turned into a racist and started killing Muslims. The author would write huge essays about it wasn't racism, his Harry was logical and didn't have a conscious, so it only made sense he would kill Muslims. Didn't even finish reading the thing.

*** ...if you want to write a fanfic with a ‘logical' Harry with no conscience, you may as well lean into racism. I mean, a psychopath could easily logic himself into genocide - /like Voldemort did/. It would be really easy to spin that if you just had the other characters reacting with suitable horror.

The essay just proves that the author actually believes in what his au!Harry was doing.

**** By the description I would say this story is “For the Love of Magic by NoddleHammer” which is blacklisted because of the multiple underage relationships. To be fair though Harry only hated muslins considerably more than he hated about 80% of the world, by the time he starts actively cursing England into upping xenophobia into outright constant harassment he had already killed lord of prisoners with cruel and inhuman experiences, essentially brainwashed lord of women into being his slaves (the misogyny sprouted later on really tops even his persecution of religions) and by the end he decided alone that the world was getting to unstable and that the best alternative was to just kill some billions of people and send the muggle world abruptly back to the Middle Ages with no hope of ever redeveloping technology and to put the cherry on top create scores of man-slaughtering beasts for the sole reason of making sure humanity never got complacent.

Really, if you try to read it go knowing that the best part will be the world building and Magic system (which, let's give credit where it is due, are both /really/ well thought of) Harry gets progressively worse as a character as the story progresses and his political ideas more and more bigoted.

** Worst I ever saw was when the author decided that the Elder Wand recognized Harry as its master when Voldemort tried to use it on him, and so it backfired on Voldemort. The explanation is that Harry had earlier disarmed Draco of his wand---not the Elder Wand---and that Draco had disarmed Dumbledore of the Elder Wand in the past (though it wasn't Draco himself who killed Dumbledore). It felt like a real ass-pull. I guess it could've been forgivable if it were some small detail, but it was at the very climax of the fic, and it's how Harry defeated Voldemort, so it stood out.

*** Don't forget Harry's plan to end the Elder Wand's power by... Never being defeated. In his whole life. And that's assuming that it would even work; after all, just because the wand is capricious enough to switch masters at the drop of a hat, doesn't mean that in the absence of a master it's incapable of choosing a new one.

At least Harry had the sense to choose a nice safe career where being defeated in combat isn't a prospect he has to worry about. Oh, wait, Auror.

  Before the start of fifth year Dumbledore changes the plans. Unfortunately he didn't bother to inform Harry. At his trial, Harry realises that it is down to him to save his own skin. To do so his Slytherin side must come out to play, and once it's out it sticks around turning life at Hogwarts on its head. Warnings: EvilDumbles, SheepOrder/Staff, GoodGuysDontGetEverythingTheirWay

** I forget the name of it. But there's a Sirius/Remus collection out there that starts out really good, it's told in three parts, one of which is Prisoner of Azkaban from Remus's perspective and it's told better than any other PoA Remus perspectives that I've read. But part of it is also Sirius telling about their time at school. And it is very casually mentioned that Remus would join Sirius in the shack and assault him to “show him what the wolf was capable of.” It was never brought up again, or dealt with, and the fact that this Remus was an abuser was just bad.

** “One World by Stellar Magic” linkffn(8993792): it started lovely ... young dentist couple while driving from a dentistry conference home in the middle of evening somewhere in Wales are surprised when suddenly house jumps into existence on the side of the road and its upper half explodes. Large branch of tree falls on the road in front, so the husband goes out from the car to find out what's going on. He finds out that all adults in the house are dead and the only living soul is small one year old boy with horrible scar on his head. Husband picks up the boy and they go the police station to report the incident. Of course, dentists have their own small daughter and you know the rest.

Seemed like a sweet start of the story. Then there is an awesome character of the Muggle policewoman Kim Hunter who finds out randomly about the magical world (I love this type of character, see also Bobbie Beadle from “Friends and Foes by Northumbrian” linkao3(3068435)) and she is eventually hired for the special X-Files-like section of MI5 investigating the hypothesis of the magical world (e.g., during the Second World War some Spitfires photographed attacking German dragons over the English Channel). Awesome.

And then it all turns towards purebloods-are-awesome super!Harry and super!Hermione (from the forgotten Squib branch of the Dagworth-Granger family) who understands everything even before Hogwarts, and it all went down the drain. And the story was soon abandoned unfinished.

Such potential wasted!
