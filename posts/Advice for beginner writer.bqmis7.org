I wanted to write fanfiction for a long time. I have written one one-shot "the loss of a twin" but haven't written much since. I have story ideas but i am finding it hard to write them out as stories. I found out that one of the things slowing me down is that i am spending a lot of time on small details so that there are no plotholes. Any advise on how to write more efficiently ?


** Concerning plotholes ... do you know how many of them are in JKR's novels? Yes, you know. Is she one of the most successful writers of all times? Yes, she is. Case closed.

What really matters is the story. Yes, it should be consistent, but reader will survive even Remus Lupin forgetting it is a full moon night (think about it; how probable it is?), if the story is captivating enough.

When you have an idea, sit down write it down. Let it stew for two weeks (so you mostly forget what it is about), then read it again. Do you like it as it is? Publish it! Do you know how to correct it? Do so! Are you bored? Drop it! Lather, rinse, repeat.

Read [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/1877741094][this]]. Morale of the essay is: write, write, write. Don't correct yourself and produce more stories. If you write 52 stories a year, one of them should be readable (that's for professional writers, of course, if it is your hobby you do along The Real Life, numbers are smaller, i.e. you need more years to write that one good story).

*** Thank you so much for the great help. I definitely will try this. Do you think i should try more one shots before going for the full length stories? I will practice more writing.

**** Yes. Read that Bradbury's essay. After ten years of writing and publishing short stories, he wrote his first novel and it was 451 degrees of Fahrenheit (or the Martian Chronicles?), a masterpiece. After writing my own novel, I am now splitting couple of short stories out of it.

****** You misspelled Fahrenheit, so between two of us we can get the name of the novel correctly. (explanation: I read it in Czech, where the name was longer, so I have actually backtranslated to English).

** I used to be the same way and you get bogged down in minute details. What really helped me was thinking about events in the context of what's important to the story. What moves the story forward or develops the character? Is it important to detail what the character has for breakfast? Maybe not. But, if you use it as an example of illustrating what a picky eater they are in order to flesh out the character, maybe. Having a firm idea of the story you're aiming to tell will help a lot in this respect.

Good luck and have fun!

*** That is very helpful. Thank you! Once i start on a scene i feel the need to think of what else is done by the character and then i am down the rabbit hole!

** Don't sweat it. Write a few more one-shots if it gets your confidence up, but if you have a longer story idea go for it. Have a structure outlined to avoid any massive plotholes, and then try not to get bogged down in the details. If there's a plothole, it's not the end of the world, people will get over it.

** A lot of the advice here is good, especially [[/u/ceplma][u/ceplma]] 's advice regarding writing in general. In terms of writing longer fics, I'd say there's two good strategies for avoiding plot holes: either outline everything out in advance, then release chapters as they are ready -- this is the strategy that I'm using for my Chessmaster series -- or write wherever the story takes you, and wait to post it until it is does -- which is a strategy I'm using for one of my side projects. Both are valid, as is a mix between the two. Do whatever works well for you, and regardless of which writing strategy to use, I would highly recommend keeping one (or more) separate documents for keeping track of your plot points, characters, world building, etc.

Hope this helps! Happy writing :)

That is a great idea. This way i don't have to keep referring backwards.

*** Let me just comment on the first strategy. Yes, I am really bad with outlining (to me story mostly comes as I keep writing, so I truly don't know how exactly it ends until I almost write it down), which is my problem, but I am still wary of that strategy. In the old world of typewriters and paper (or even before that in the world of ink and papers) this was known as serialized writing and whole novels were published like that. Many famous novels by Alexander Dumas were written in this way including The Three Musketeers. In almost all cases, quality of writing suffered greatly by this methodology. Although he was the absolute master of dialogue and storytelling, so The Three Musketeers is a page-turner even after all these years, taken from the larger distance, the book is collection of plot-holes, storylines running nowhere, vacant space obviously caused by search of the new plot-line, etc. (it didn't help he fought about the very style of the novel with his ghostwriter; and let not me start on the utility of characters like Grimaud; and yes, the similarity to JKR is obvious). And of course, it is another piece of evidence that captive story is more important than details.

Michael Crichton is said to declare somewhere “Books aren't written - they're rewritten. Including your own. It is one of the hardest things to accept, especially after the seventh rewrite hasn't quite done it.” (although the origin of the saying [[https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/12/14/rewritten/][is a way more complicated]]). I believe for almost every serialized novel putting it down and rewriting would help (although, apparently Dumas' temperament did not allow him to do very good job of it, he tried with Three Musketeers and the result was not much better).

In summary: I tried to write my novel in this style and I had to give up after the fifth chapter, when it was obvious the thing needs complete rewrite.

**** Story never flows well for me. I get these random ideas that jump into my mind that I forget if I don't immediately write down. And it probably has nothing to do with the story at that point. Soon my mind is a jumble of ideas and I'm lost on the story.

** I read your one-shot. It's interesting, better than most. I'll write my opinion on it here.

​

I can't comment that much on the plot (since it was a one-shot), the pacing however was excelent. You didn't rush it (as I've seen a lot of newer writers do).

The narration was good, except for the scene where Harry is explaining how he got "killed" by Voldemort. You reffer to Mr. and Mrs. Weasley as mum and dad even though the story is narrated by a third-person omniscient narrator.

Do not underestimate punctuation. It may not seem all that important, but lack of proper punctuation can tire a reader overtime. You tried, but you could do better.

There are other minor mistakes, but it would be nitpicking to point all of them out. In general, try not to fudge up the grammar/syntax, eat words or confuse similar sounding words (ex: were/where, their/there). Also, I didn't notice it in your story, but the letter " i " is actually capitalized when it's by it self (" I ") even if it's not in the start of a sentence. Minor mistakes like these add up over time and can push readers away regardless of the quality of your plot.

** I gently encourage you to stick with shorter stories for now.

I personally am rather methodical with my writing, and it's worked well for me. Either way, try to work on your story before you begin writing it out. Think about such things as logic, pacing, and characters.

Most novice authors' language is wishy-washy. Too many filler words, adverbs, long sentences etc. Try to keep an eye on words like 'that, seemed, appeared, very' and so on. You can usually cut about 90% of those.

Concerning language, try to give different characters different voices (the way they speak and use language levels). Hermione, for example, speaks distinctively different than Ron.

Also, if you're working with a third person narrator, try to keep his voice sharp, crisp. Experiments with the narrating voice are thrilling but, more often than not, failed acts of bravery. Personal narrators, likewise, have many pitfalls.

Other general tips: your story should start out extremely strong. The first chapter needs to be at least the second best you'll ever write or, in case in a shorter story, your first two paragraphs.

The ending should, somehow, reference your beginning. This, for example, is why most fanfiction authors fail with longer stories; it's difficult to keep up coherence with earlier chapters if you haven't planned it out perfectly (which most don't even bother to attempt).

Also, as depressing as it is, stories you've thought of but haven't written down don't count for anything. It's as simple as that. It's better to write down a bad story than to unendingly think out a decent one.

Lastly, as many have already said, virtually all stories (even those of professional authors) are rubbish when first written down. That's why they have other authors, editors, and friends who give opinion and such. Since you're unlikely to go to such lengths when writing fanfiction, it's advisable to get a bit of distance (i.e. don't look at your story for a while: 2-3 days at the very least), before you make your final verdict.
