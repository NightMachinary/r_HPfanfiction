I read this a long time ago, can't even remember when, and it has Harry in his sixth year at Hogwarts where he starts dating Cho and I think it has a scene where they hook up for the first time in the Room of Requirement.

The fic focuses a lot on their relationship and had a lot of romantic fluff. It had sex scenes but wasn't too smutty, I think. Honestly, I can't remember too many details beyond that and that it was an incomplete fic. I think it had elements of Harry's power being tied to Gryffindor(?), or the sword, hence the title "Heart of Lion"? I might be misremembering so apologies.

If anyone can help me out in clarifying whether I actually read this or hallucinated a good Harry/Cho fic, my brain would be very thankful.


** Oooooh! A Harry/Cho fan? Please be my friend. I feel very alone on the internet being a fan of this ship.

There is almost no good Harry/Cho fic out there. I'm going to try writing some myself, though whether or not it'll be good is anyone's guess :P

Your story reminds me a little of what might have been the premise for the Autumn Swan on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]], which got rebooted a little while ago. I've never read through the whole thing but I'm pretty sure it involves some Harry-Heir-Of-Gryffindor.

And I don't know if you've read Or Die Trying: The Story of Cho Chang by Monkeymouse/Dungeonwonk, but highly recommend otherwise.

*** Haha, sure, it's always nice to meet other Harry/Cho fans. I remember being surprised to see how little interest there is for Cho considering she's one of Harry's canon love interests.

I've already read Autumn Swan, the original and the reboot, and remember starting Die Trying but discontinued with it for some reason. I've pretty much scoured the internet and was going through the internet archives when I got lazy and decided to refer to the experts like yourselves.

** Have you tried checking [[https://www.ultimatehpfanfiction.com/cho][these]]. They mirror a lot of decent stories and therefore might still have fics deleted elsewhere.

*** Thanks for the link! I'll check them out since I haven't read most of them but it seems like it doesn't have the one I'm looking for. I appreciate the help, thanks again.
