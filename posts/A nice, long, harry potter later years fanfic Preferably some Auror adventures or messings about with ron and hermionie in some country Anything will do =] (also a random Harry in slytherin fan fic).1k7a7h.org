I just found a really great Harry in slytherin fanfic if anyone's interested too!

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3736151/1/Better-Be-Slytherin]]


** 'After the War' is exceptionally long and has a LOT of detailed info on them training, catching people after bk7, their lives. and 'Harry's Future' follows in the same vein, but Harry quickly becomes head of the MLD and turns it around, its clever and knowledgeable, and involves a year at the start where he returns to Hogwarts for his education. I honestly would reccomend Harry's Future, as it has more plot in it and different arcs, like a proper book, as does it's sequel 'Professor Potter', and the sequel to that. Currently 3 books in the saga and they are incredibly long, they'll do you for awhile. But don't discount After The War either!

--------------

I'd personally recommend both. Read After The War first, as there is some brilliant quidditch stuff in there, auror training, ect. Then move onto Harry's Future as the worldbuilding is much better and its a longer and more fleshed out series with multiple books. I can reccomend more once you're done
