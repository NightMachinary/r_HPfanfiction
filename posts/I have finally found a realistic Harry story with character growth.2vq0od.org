[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10658836/1/Harry-Potter-Zero]] this story is about how the author thinks a neglected Harry might really act. Dursleys didn't beat him with a barbed cane or Harry isn't acting like 5 year old. He is acting like a social awkward 14 year old who just wants to be out of the lime light and not be bothered. But through the tri-wizard tournament and some help from teachers he becomes something more.
