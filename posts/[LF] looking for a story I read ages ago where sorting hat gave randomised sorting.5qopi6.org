Hey there, I've been trying to find this story and not had any luck so far. In it, Fred and George decided it would be funny to feed the sorting hat some sort of potion which confused it meaning that it gave a completely random sorting. I believe Hermione and Neville ended up in Slutherin, Ron and Pansy in Ravenclaw, Harry and Draco in Hufflepuff etc.

It was interesting because of how they all started acting like they belonged in their respective house, so for instance Ron became more studious as he was a Ravenclaw. So, could anyone help?


** Oh yeah, that fic was fun. Here you go:

That sounds like a really naughty smut fanfiction...

*** The problem is that you will have people like me who pronounce it "Sluth-erin". Which isn't anywhere near as smutty sounding.

**** ffnbot!slim

- linkffn(5467974) contains it, but typo
- linkffn(6767141) uses it, along with 'Ravenwood' but, the only adjective I find to describe it is 'wtf'
- linkffn(4138487) pls no
- linkffn(5667456) actually uses it in ch13
- linkffn(11478758) uses it in ch3, but not really much

It looks like there is no quality fanfiction that actually uses this, so it's completely open if you ever need a cheap joke on 'Potter Stinks' level!

***** Amusing , nowdays finding even the most inane thing in HP fanfiction isn't surprising in the least.

Sadly i still haven't found a non-crack Communist/socialist!Harry(or)Hermione , but it's only time untill someone pops that.
