** Pretty much every pro Snape story. It seems to be an either or thing with fanfiction. You either like Snape and bash the Marauders or you like the Marauders and bash Snape.

*** I suspected this would be the case, that's why I worded my request as I did. I'm hoping someone has written one were both parties are bastards, just in differing ways.

  What if Snape had received some better guidance when he was young from people who cared enough to notice what he was going through and looked deeper than the surface? What if there had been Slytherins who weren't aspiring Death Eaters? Would their assistance be enough to help a few young and hot tempered teens? (Slow burn romance)

  Sixteen-year-old Severus leaves Hogwarts to attend school in the U.S., and possibly pursue a new life. But what of the growing darkness back home that threatens Lily and all he's ever known? (This story is an AU and does not follow HP canon!)

** Linkffn(the horse by elsa2) Long, well written, has a horse. Harry's thoughts and attitude towards the marauders becomes very critical, but it does have a happy ending. Kind of...

  Looking after a Muggle animal should be easy compared to saving Hogwarts from Voldemort. Harry and Draco might disagree with that. Featuring Luna, Marauders, peppermints and, of course, a tall, black, badtempered horse named Simon.
