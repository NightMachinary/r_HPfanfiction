What I mean is after reading it, you are just left wondering why/how.

For me, it was an old fic with an !IndyHarry. Dumbledore imperiused Vernon to marry Petunia and be a terrible person. This was before the prophecy was made btw. I was just left thinking wtf...

God himself could descend from the heavens in glorious holy light, flowers grows around him, people are healed and evil-doers immediately beg for forgiveness.\\
He then tells Harry to stop being a brat.

*** Anyways to answer your question... there was this timetravel fic where Harry and Tom had a frenemy relationship (no romance) and Dumbledore, realizing Harry is a horcrux goes back in the past (it's assumed Harry can't return to his timeline) and manipulates his younger self to kill Harry. It's the turning point in Tom Riddle's life that makes him become Voldemort but after encountering Harry in the present timeline and realizes that he's his old school nemesis/friend he starts to get overflown by regrets and his soul heals and dies in the process.

It's a weird manipulation because for once manipulative!Dumbledore's scheming works only to be revealed that they didn't change anything and the whole shit the world was in was because Dumbledore didn't understand the consequences to his actions. Also he manipulated himself.

Letting Remus attend was the the least of it (I admit to being curious why Remus was the only werewolf he championed); he had subtly arranged for people to marry in one of them, including James and Lily. Never mind the marriages fractured later, he had gotten what he wanted.

In the other, he was furious James and Lily had gotten married as it ruined some plan, and he wanted Harry to marry Ginny in an attempt to recoup whatever goal he had in mind. One of the ones where Dumbledore is a full-bore blood bigot.
