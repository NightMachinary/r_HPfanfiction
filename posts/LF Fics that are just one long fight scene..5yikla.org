See title. Does anyone know any stories which are just one long action scene? With judicious application of Chandler's Law?

So far, Dumbledore, Harry, Grindelwald, and a few others have thrown down. It's pretty damn epic, and I'll be using the combat in the story (basically) as a workshop to improve my own.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

***** Haha. Yeah she was kind of attractive and her IRL voice is nowhere near as annoying as on the show. She had a guest appearance on Californication that was pretty fun - and surprise, her character was crazy once again.

  Fifty years ago, Grindelwald won the duel that shaped the world. In a land overwhelmed by darkness, a hero emerges: a young wizard with the power, influence and opportunity to restore the light. Harry Potter, caught up in a deadly game of cat and mouse, must decide what he truly believes. Does this world deserve redemption? Or, more importantly, does he?
