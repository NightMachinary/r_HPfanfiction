I think is was part of a major one-shot collection, but I'm not sure.

It's set in the end of the third book where Harry & Hermione confronts Sirius Black after he naps Ron. Lupin shows up and so do Snape later. I distinctly remember Sirius having a hard time convincing Harry and Hermione that Snape had it comming.


** haha, that's great. I try to just ignore the whole bizarre near murder and life debt (which, wtf?). Snape can be mean but have a Lily-sized weakness and regret; SB and JP were still jerks; and everything still kinda works.
