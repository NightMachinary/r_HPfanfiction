** I'm assuming you mean in terms of a romance etc with Harry?

If so, you could try The Baghera Lord by lordmauryadmaurya

My link is to hpfanficarchive (which still seems to be down) but it looks like it can be found on Ficwad and elsewhere (though there the author is just lordmaurya).

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.
