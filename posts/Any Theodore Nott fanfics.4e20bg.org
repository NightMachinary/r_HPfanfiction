I am actually sort of writing a story about him and I hoped I could read some works to get inspiration. Any ideas?


** Depends on what kind of Theo you want. I find that really good Dramiones often have him in a large role but he is also a good main character.

  My take on the Slytherin!Harry genre. What if Harry's less-than-happy childhood had left him more jaded than canon? No pairings, and you won't find any eleven year olds talking as if they were at a Renaissance fair here either.
