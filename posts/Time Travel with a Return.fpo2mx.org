I'm looking for a long (100k+ preferred) fic of a Hermione centric time travel story.

Something where she ends up in the past, but where she /returns/ to the future. I really want to read something where when she returns, nothing has changed and the timeline is how it was when she left it, so even though she interacted with people and did stuff to influence the future, she was simply fulfilling time instead of changing it.

The best examples of stories that do this are: * The Debt of Time - ShayaLonnie * Time Heals All Wounds - brightsilverkitty * Chemistry and Timing - TheBookBully

And I'd really love it if we get a good amount of story from after she returns to the present (like Debt of Time does with a whole book in the present when Hermione gets back.) Time Heals All Wounds does this, but that part isn't as long as I'd like it to be. Chemistry and Timing really doesn't have much after Hermione returns to the present, so that's not ideal.

I'd love to see the toll it takes on the other half of the pairing, and how they deal with Hermione being gone.

It has to be Hermione-centric please! I'd prefer a pairing, with a lot of plot also.

Most pairings are fine; HGSB, HGRL, HGSS, HGLM, HGBL etc!

I've read:

- The Debt of Time - ShayaLonnie
- Time Heals All Wounds - brightsilverkitty
- Chemistry and Timing - TheBookBully
- Used to Be Mine (WIP) - Kittenshift17
- Evanescent Memory - DragonFire10
- Building a Mystery - StBridgit (there were some changes to the timeline, but a lot of it stayed intact.)

I think the lowest word count I'll go for is 60k.

Also, I prefer something with a HEA/The pairing is able to be together when Hermione gets back please :)

Thank you!! :)


** Hermione/Kingsley although there are other relationships. She's in the past for quite awhile, and it's post DH. There isn't as much after she returns (especially compared to The Debt of Time) but there are a significant amount of snippets into what's happening in the present time/future while Hermione is gone.

And Hermione/Snape. This is slightly different because she essentially ages herself but it has the time travel feel? You might like it still. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/311126/chapters/498237]]

** One of my favorite time travel fics of all time is linkao3(Time Turned Back by TaraSoleil)

It switches pov between Harry and Hermione. Might be a bit more Harry than Hermione centric. Pairings are Sirius/Harry and Hermione/Remus. Even if you are not into slash I highly recommend it as it's very well written.

I don't want to Spoiler you but that being said, they return to the future in the end and there's a happy end.

#+begin_quote
  Broken and angry after losing Sirius fifth year, Harry recklessly puts himself in harms way, dragging Hermione along for the ride. Now they are stuck in another time with some all too familiar faces. Will the time with lost loved ones heal Harry or end up doing more damage?
