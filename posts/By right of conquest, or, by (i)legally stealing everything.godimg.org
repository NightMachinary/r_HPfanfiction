I.E

The bodies weren't even cold. Malfoy was there, eyes open, even as the rings from his fingers were being stripped by the steady, experienced hands of Hermione Granger.

His wife (former I guess, Draco being dead) stood there with teary eyes. Harry didn't care.

Bill came past, passing Harry his estimate of the value of the property. Harry grinned.\\
Ron came past, waving his wand as he stripped the gold leaf off of the blatently ugly picture frames. And then burent them. The world did not need the pleasure of old Malfoys screaming about blood traitors, not even old ones.\\
Harry moved his eyes to Malfoys wife. Harry had forgoten what her name was. "Sign this." Harry said.

She took one look at it. "You expect me to sign away everything?"\\
"Yes" Harry arched his eyebrow at her.

"No" At her reply, Harry laughed then pointed his wand at her.

*** Probably that the right of conquest trope would encourage certain less than civilized activities.

***** That's what would happen in a realistic world, but usually Harry inherits/conquers a bunch of titles, and with the exception of a few incompetent enemies, everyone just kowtows to him.

** I only saw Right of Conquest being used when people signed away their loyalty to Voldemort and it only worked for Harry because of the nature of their fight.

Other times is because both contestants where considered in the appropriate level where it would apply.

Most of the times it's just the way the Elder Wand rolls.
