** Soul Bonds are stupid and lazy and shouldn't exist in any form of fiction for any reason. The only possible exception is if it is played off as horror.

*** I mean I thought the same about marriage contracts and then I read Contractual Invalidation, The Amalgation Agreement and the Legacy.

While I dislike the trope generally speaking, it isn't impossible to write a good story with it. Soul Bonds stories can still be well done.

Hell you managed a Harry/Voldemort if that can be done so can this.

**** Marriage contracts, which I think are almost equally dumb, don't inherently remove the agency of the characters involved. There can still be choice and by extension there can still be development.

A soul bond almost always removes the agency from one of the characters and simply makes that character a puppet for the other. There's nothing romantic, sweet, or redeeming about that. It's often just a subliminal male-power fetish than anything else that purely comes from people that do not understand or respect the power of free will and choice.

I feel like removing the characters ability to choose removes their ability to love or develop. And inherently makes the whole thing pointless. Stories should be about growth. Soul Bonds remove the possibility of growth in favor of wish-fulfillment happily-ever-after, which eliminates the entire point of writing a story.

So, as a whole, I would say it's impossible to write a good story with a Soul Bond because the mere existence of it is going to derail too much anyway.

The only exception I would make would be where the bond is presented as something horrific that must be fought against constantly rather than some happy ending mechanism.

It's alarming to me how something that effectively removes choice (and rather problematic that it's nearly always the female's choice that's removed) from a relationship is viewed as a positive. It's a terrible, rapey concept that should be nuked off the face of the planet.

  OOtP Mid Year. Every now and then throughout wizarding history, a pair of individuals very close to one another find that their magic has grown attached. A bond is formed. A Soul Bond. And may hell burn the idiot who ever thought having one was a 'good' thing! A Soul Bond story done 'right.' No bashing. A Harry and Hermione love and war story.

***** There's one story I've read where soul bonds were done well - at least in the first few chapters: The Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond linkffn(9818387)

Without wanting to be too spoily, Harry and Ginny are bonded accidentally after the CoS and do /not/ like it. I've not finished the story because after a few promising chapters the author started edging towards humour and then went for fluffiness too. And it seems to be abandoned. But it was a good start.

  A Love Story that doesn't start with love. A Soul Bond that doesn't start with a kiss. Love is not handed out freely. Love is earned. When Harry and Ginny are Soul Bonded, they discover that love is not initially included, and that it's something that must be fought for. H/G SoulBond!RealisticDevelopment!EndOfCOS!GoodDumbledore! Trust me, you've never seen a soul-bond fic like this

** Canonically, the rules of a soul bond are as follows:

1. You prepare a recipient of your soul using special enchantments which are unknown but quite gruesome. It is also a good idea to place protective enchantments on the recipient.

2. You kill someone. Contrary to common belief, it does not need to be with the Killing Curse. Indeed, it's sufficient that a person die on your orders, such as being killed by an animal under your control.

3. You cast an unknown spell which extracts a fragment of your splintered soul and places it into the prepared object.

4. Thereafter, a bond exists between your soul and the object. The object anchors you to life: so long as the object exists, you cannot die (though your body can be destroyed).

** Generally implemented badly and never explores the concept of a soul.

For example it might be neat if some twins were literally the same person reincarnated into life at the same time as his previous life. They would be soul bonded because they are the same person.

What is a soul?

A non-coporeal duplicate of a person with a concurrent existance? If so why wouldn't you be able to have several souls? After all what's stopping five non-coporeal real time backups from existing? Could you then make a false soul by using a completely different incoporeal energy that performs the same function as a concurrent backup entity?

An essential part of life that the body ceases to function without? If so what is the relationship between the soul and the brain? Is it then possible to exceed your meat-brains mental abilities by expanding your mind while in astral form?

Perhaps both of these concepts can be simultaneously implemented and one of them can linked to another but the other cannot.

of course any fic that uses a soul bond is likely a crapfic whose author doesn't have the wit to explore this kind of stuff.

** I've seen some good soul bonds and I've seen some bad ones. It is certainly an interesting device and I'm not totally against it appearing in a story as long as it is done well.

The "template" for how to handle a Soul Bond is in the Amplitude Frequency and Reistance of a Soul by Council. The way he handled it was rather well done even if the plot never got anywhere.

What exactly did you want to do with it?

If you are looking for soul bond fics there are plenty.
