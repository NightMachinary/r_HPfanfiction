I didn't realize how controversial it was to point out that letters arrive on or around characters' eleventh birthdays. I remember a discussion where some concluded that all letters arrive mid July because Draco was in Diagon Alley on the 31st, but JKR is well known for choosing plot over characterization.

In Short Stories from Hogwarts: of Heroism, Hardship, and Dangerous Hobbies JKR writes about McGonagall and Lupin:

"Minerva never forgot how much her mother cried, when the letter of admittance into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry arrived on Minerva's eleventh birthday..."

McGonagall's birthday is October 4th.

"Shortly before Remus's eleventh birthday, no less a person than Albus Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts, arrived uninvited on the Lupins' doorstep"

Lupin's birthday is March 10th

This also doesn't contradict what's in the books. Harry's letter first arrives mid-late July and Ginny's arrives in August.


** It /feels/ like an inconsistency, especially given real-life summer holidays (which run from mid-July to the week of September 1st), even if it's not.

Harry and Ginny's letters arrive during the summer holidays, which isn't all that problematic - especially in Ginny's case, as she's a pureblood witch and pretty much already knew. Any Muggleborns who get their letter on their birthday might get mildly screwed by the system, especially if their birthday is the very tail-end of the summer hols.

March and October are mid-school, which would be more problematic for scheduling visits and letters - unless Albus Dumbledore, /the Headmaster/, is both the only person doing visits and the one with the most time on his hands (both seem unlikely).

Rowling in general has a habit of unnecessarily "tangling" canon with pretty much everything that happened after the release of Book 6.

*** Calendars are not JKR's strong suit - see, the school year /always/ starting on September 1st, and seemingly having September 2nd as a monday because of that.

The way I read it, the implication for what JKR intended is for the letters to arrive on the birthdays, since that's a big scene and everything for Harry.

However, he obviously got the letters sent earlier than his birthday, so we can have arguments with both ones. I think having it on the birthdays is more cinematic, so I don't mind the slight liberties taken for that to be the case.

**** I personally went the other way for my fic and had the letters go out at the start of the summer holidays, across the board.

I prefer it that way, it's consistent and doesn't cause any additional problems for Muggleborns (see: Justin Finch-Fletchley, who would have to have his name removed from the listing at /Eton/ - if his birthday was late in the summer holidays that's really problematic for his parents).

I don't really see "letters arrive on the birthday" as any more cinematic than otherwise - if he gets it earlier it'd still be a big moment, and then by contrast his birthday could be either a quiet moment (given the Dursleys ignore it) or another "big moment" entirely (given not-Dursley caretakers).

We can agree to disagree there, though.

***** Either approach can work, certainly!

I find the birthday approach more cinematic/fitting for the magical world partly because it isn't as practical - and partly because I find the idea of it being tied to a given age also seems fitting magically speaking (eg, Hogwarts having a magical book that has everyone who's magical enough for it and updating when they get a certain age/sending the letter out). Plus, wizards caring about muggleborns doesn't strike me as something they'd really worry about ;)

But I can certainly see the argument for the other view!

***** The way I resolve this in my headcanon is that letters /used/ to be delivered near one's birthday. But changes in the last few decades, and possibly the curse on the Defense position (which causes the course plan for Defense to change sporadically) led to the letters being sent during summer instead.

***** Have to say that if Justin was born in the late summer holidays it would still potential cause issues for someone like him. Eton starts at age 13 so his parents would have plenty of time to take his name off the list.

But given he was going to go there, he'd likely be at a fee paying preparatory school still, unlike a lot of other muggleborns who'd have just finished primary school and would be moving on to secondary school. And maybe his parents would have already paid for the upcoming term so it would be somewhat unfair.

Additionally the September 1st date only accounts for some children in the UK, as schools in Scotland start the school year in August, so a Scottish kid could start the school year, have their birthday on the 25th August for example and then be sent a letter telling them they're magic - at which point their parents then have to shell out loads of money on that as well.

And finally the whole thing is based on English schools with the Primary-Secondary system and being 11 when leaving Primary, but even in England not every school system is that. Some are Lower-Middle-Upper, and you tend to be 11 midway through Middle school.

So yeah it's all awkward, which is why it's probably just better to ignore it all, because it isn't standardised.

***** My headcanon is that all children receive their letters until an established date. If their birthdays are on or before this date, they get it on their birthday. Otherwise, students receive them in a random order that gives preference to Muggle-borns, so they can have more time to prepare.

This would be very important in the first year, but I assume whoever visits them also takes them to Diagon Alley to buy school supplies. Though, no one will help them in the following years, so if the student lives away from London, their parents can use Muggle transportation to take them there or to another big city that might have their own "Diagon Alleys".

Of course they can use the Knight Bus, which is much faster, but I assume parents wouldn't let their kids go unsupervised to another city at such young age, and I'm not sure Muggles can take the Knight Bus. It uses magic to avoid transit and all, so I suppose they would be crushed to death when it gets thinner.

My fault it seems they didn't go because they were uncontrollable and shunned.

And I doubt Dumbledore can visit just anyone and invite them. Remus appears to be a very special case in that he wasn't born a werewolf and he didn't become one as an adult, so his name was written on the list when he was born.

In fact, Dumbledore /only/ visits because he'd heard what Greyback had done. Had he not, I assume Remus would have received the letter and his father would have rejected it.

** Honestly, it just seems like an oversight. JKR sucks at keeping dates consistent. I'm of the belief that letters get sent out the summer before first year.

When Dumbledore visits Tom Riddle at Wool's, Tom is already 11. According to the Harry Potter Lexicon (not officially canon but they seem to do a pretty good job at sorting out JKR's wonky calendar) the meeting takes place in August 1938. I think they infer this because Mrs. Cole mentions that Tom does something to two other orphans “on the summer outing- we take them out, you know, once a year.” The way it's phrased implies that it's the most recent summer outing. Since Tom's birthday is on New Year's Eve (and since we know Hogwarts doesn't send out letters when students are months away from turning 11) we know that this would have to take place in the summer of 1938.

There's also the way Hermione is seen as weird and a “know-it-all” for having read her books in advance of school. I think most anyone (especially muggleborns and others raised without magic) would want to know more about this new world, but reading 8 textbooks is excessive if it's done in less than 3 months. But in 11 months for the people with September birthdays? That seems highly doable.

I also imagine that they send out letters at around the same time because it's probably less pain on the professors. As evidenced by the aforementioned Dumbledore telling Tom about magic (among other canon instances), we can infer that professors tell children brought up without magic about Hogwarts and magic. Imagine it's exam season and you are dedicating your time to your current students, but no you can't mark papers or work on your less plans because you have to tell Muggleborn Student ABC that magic is real.

** I dunno about controversial, it just never occured to me that that would be the case, because it makes no sense. Ignoring McGonagall's letter, it always seemed obvious to me that a letter to tell you curriculum, books & co would arrive at some point between the end of the last school year and the start of the new one. Late enough so the teachers have been finalised and everyone knows what books to get, early enough so that the students have enough time to shop. And that was pretty much it. Especially since that's how any boarding school does it, and the birthday thing is never stated anywhere in the original books.

If you /don't/ want to ignore that bit of writing you cited, you have to come up with explanations in other places. Say, how the correlation of how early (or late) the letter arrives and the perpetual search for a new Defence teacher works, or how the unfortunate children with a birthday on August 31st are supposed to arrange for shopping before going to Hogwarts.

And rationally, it's irrelevant either way; since the cut-off point has to be /somewhere/, there's always gonna be one who was born a day too late (and the age range between the youngest and the oldest will also always be just about a year).

***** We don't really have a date in my country. Our classes start at the end of February or beginning of March and usually end a week or two before Christmas. Parents usually enroll their kids from January of said year until January or February of the next year. So, if you start first grade, you're supposed to turn 7 at some point between this period, which could be before school year even starts or almost when the next one does. Also, some parents choose to enroll their kids in first grade a year earlier than the standard, so they graduate at 16 instead of 17.

** How would that work though? The letters contain the booklist, which isn't finalized until summer because of the new DADA professor every year. I don't think Lupin and McGonagall work well as examples, since McGonagall turned 11 before the Voldemort cursed the position and I'm pretty sure Lupin would have turned 11 the first year after Voldemort cursed the position, so nobody would have known that there was going to be a new DADA professor the next year.

Using Harry and Ginny as examples to prove your point also doesn't really work, since, as you pointed out, Draco was getting his robes at the same time even though his birthday was 2 months before, and Ginny got her letter at the same time everyone else in the Burrow got their booklists, implying that everyone gets their letters at the same time.

You hit the nail on the head: if, as op says, it's controversial to claim that the letters are sent out around the time of each individual student's birthday, then that's only because the assertion is dependent on the idea of literary authority, which is, y'know, /controversial./ It's a bit like eating a bite of cherry pie and saying to yourself "wow, there sure are cherries in this!"

Ideally, they would send the letters to muggleborns around that time as well, so that there would be no problems with any muggle schools. Harry got his first letter around the 24th of July, Although they would have assumed that he knew about wizards, as his aunt could have told him. Therefore, I believe that letters were sent sometime after valentine's for muggleborns, and around a week before their birthdays for half-bloods and purebloods.

** It's just clunky no matter how you do it, though. Mostly because the school year takes up most of the calendar year, and if some random Muggleborn's letter arrives April 3, does McGonnagall have to skip classes to take the kid to Diagon? I mean, it's convenient for Harry that his birthday is in summer, and the teachers aren't working, but for kids not born in summer what happens? They get a letter saying that they're born magical and are welcome to a magical school, and we'll talk to you in the summer when we have time? Or, like Hermione, born on September 17th, does she get a letter and have to wait until summer, or does she get a letter AND a visit and have to hold off on doing magic for nearly a whole year? Neither of those are good.

Basically, this just gets back to JKR not thinking through the consequences of anything she writes. She's a seat-of-the-pants writer who doesn't worry too much about things making sense, which is why fanfic is so easy to write. There's just SO MUCH that needs to be fixed.

** I think I have a way to make this consistent with canon and not too stupid: on their eleventh birthdays, they get JUST the page with the Hogwarts acceptance. Then, in the summer, the book lists go out. (They really have to go out then, because they need the required books from the new DADA professor.) We even saw this in the books, where one year the book lists came out later than usual in the summer.

Thus, people with late-summer birthdays, like Harry, get BOTH in one letter the first time.

It's still pretty stupid, because McGonagall has enough to do without keeping track of all the kids turning eleven, and most of those kids get TWO letters the first year, but I think it covers all the canon bases.

** So for my stories I kind of hybridize the two. First year letters go out on the kid's birthday, not for any practical reason, but because it's Tradition(tm) and whenever someone brings up the idea of changing that you get a bunch of purebloods pulling heartstrings about why people want to deprive their children of this most treasured rite of passage et cetera et cetera et cetera. So first year letters go out on birthdays, no matter how illogical and inconvenient this may be.

I also really like how this can be used to make interesting plot points! I love the idea that Hermione, born September 19, spent most of her year before Hogwarts knowing about magic. I loved a plot point I saw in a story once where Flora & Hestia Carrow were born split across the midnight line of August 31st and September 1st, so Hestia didn't get her letter until the following year and her older relatives treated her like a squib for the next year even though Dumbledore pointed out the hard cut-off line for letters. I even love the idea that Dumbledore deliberately sent early letters to Harry for Dumbledorish reasons (make them up, there's both good and bashing options!)

** I guess it could me that you start school if you turn eleven during that school year rather than actually being eleven when then school year started.

** Regardless of whether letters are sent on/around birthdays or during the summer hols... I suspect the “controversial” part is that you're pointing it out on people's fics. Pretty much universally, fanfic authors do not like to have people like you “point out” stuff that's canonically ambiguous in their comment sections. It's not controversial, it's rude.

*** Nope, I pointed it out on a post asking about Ginny's birthday. If I'm reading non Harry centric fics it's 5th-7th YR J/L.

** In Chamber of Secrets everyone's letters arrive at the same time, presumably July 31st because it's Harry's birthday (might have been August 1st tho), including Ginny's. Now, someone could argue that Harry's letter was sent on his birthday, so it's a birthday based system, right?

Wrong. Ron's birthday is in March and the twins in April, so why are they receiving their letters in july/august? Now, Ginny's birthday IS in August, on the 11th, BUT when they go to the Diagonal Alley, it is packed with students, admittedly, not only first years.

But back in Philosopher's Stone, Harry meets Draco for the first time inside Madam Malkin's. Draco's birthday is June 5th. We all know he was a spoiled brat, he most probably wouldn't have waited so long to get his stuff. I believe they all, regardless of their date of birth, receive the letter around the last week of july and the first of august.

*** Book list and acceptance letter need not be sent at the same time. My high school acceptance letter arrived in April or May. My year 1 supplies list in late June (book list wasn't needed, we hired them from the school)

***** Hogwarts has a monopoly and is smaller, so it's different for Hogwarts, but for us it was that people might be accepted into multiple schools and reject some. Or none and go for a second round of sign ups. Our class assignments (we had 13 groups of first years spread over 3 difficulty levels + high level bilingual, multiple of each) also weren't part of the first letter, but our level assignments were.

****** This is so complex, may I ask where do you live?

Here in Brazil you basically just enroll, be it a private or public school. You have to go through a test if you want a scholarship but that's about it.

If it's a federal school they have a test, similar to what happens for ppl to get into university but "regular" schools don't have anything like that, so it's a very foreign concept to me.

******* I'm in the Netherlands. It's not really complex at all though it seems it. We don't have admittance tests, but we do have level-tests in the last year of primary school. That gives you access to that level of high school. In all schools. However in some areas there are 10 or more high schools for every level so if all thousands of students in a city want that one school, the school will be full. There are plenty of schools in every city, no private and no scholarships, but some schools are more popular.
