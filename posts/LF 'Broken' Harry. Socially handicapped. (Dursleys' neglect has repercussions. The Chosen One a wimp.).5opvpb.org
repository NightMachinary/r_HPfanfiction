It suddenly hit me that if a normal kid was raised in an 'upstanding' environment with the Dursley's, being belittled, blamed, oppressed for just existing and isolated by other kids, that would probably lead to a hefty amount of inferiority complexes and other psychological problems, especially if the person is meek and prone to anxiety.

I'm not talking about beaten black and blue, starved for weeks and violated Harry that then shrugs everything off and becomes a thorn in GG's Dumbledore ass as most broken Harry fics are wont to use.

Just the emotional neglect, the constant verbal barbs with raised tones, and being ostracized would be more than enough to do major emotional damage to Harry for him, enough to develop a sense of inferiority, suffer panic attacks in stressful situations, clam up when under scrutiny. Maybe develop coping mechanisms such as an inner cynic voice or split personalities, or emotional numbness.

So imagine how a timid, uncertain Harry, with a shy disposition and prone to panic would react when crowded by a mob of fans in Diagon, or meeting with Hagrid and Fluffy, or making a stance against Draco. He'd be the antithesis for a Gryffindor I think.

TLDR: I'm looking for a neglected Harry fic where the Durley's managed to damage Harry's self worth enough for him (or her) to develop some kind of psychological problems and/or coping mechanisms. Harry is too timid, quiet, shy and uncertain in his (or her) own abilities and too awkward when around people, because of limited social interactions (kind of like a mix of Luna and younger Neville), and that breaks the whole plot flow and how he (or she) interacts with people and how events develop. It's should be painfully obvious to Dumbledore and the staff that something is wrong.


** WARNING-Unpopular Opinion

I have always felt that the canon version of Harry actually is an okay portrayal. He may be easy to empathize with, but I doubt that he is an overly fun person to be around irl. He is very paranoid and suspicious, fast to assume the worst and easily assumes the worst about Snape and Malfoy just because they don't get along. He can have anger issues, doesn't get along too well with people, has little to no regard whatsoever for the rules, and has very poor social skills. He isn't very tactfully, and instead of explaining his views logically, he verbally antagonizes people who disagree with him. Actually, he antagonizes just about everyone he dislikes, including Voldemort, Malfoy, Snape(numerous occasions), Umbridge, and even his friends on rare occasion.

TLDR-While I doubt he exhibits every single indicater of abuse in the textbook, as a non-pyschologist, I am content with Rowling's portrayal of Harry as a sarcastic, backtalking, rule breaking kid with a penchant for paranoia, and anger issues. And angst. Can never forget the surly moody angst.

*** I'm not so sure Harry is no fun to be around. He had quite a humorous and sarcastic side, and he got along with pranksters and jokesters well. One key reason he liked Ron and Ginny so much was because their funny side.

It was difficult NOT to be angsty and paranoid in his situation. The greatest majority of teens would have utterly cracked under the pressure he was in. Most people in the fandom, including adults, would have been completely paralyzed in fear by that troll in Year 1.

So I would always look at the circumstances before judging negatively about someone's character.

*** This is similar to my opinion(and I completely agree for the most part) , however I think that you're being unfair to Harry with this part:

/"he verbally antagonizes people who disagree with him. Actually, he antagonizes just about everyone he dislikes, including Voldemort, Malfoy, Snape(numerous occasions), Umbridge"/

All of these people you mentioned have been the first to antagonise Harry from the first meeting. How you wrote it implies that Harry's reaction was unreasonable.

**** I will copy paste my answer from another commenter with similar views.

My point is that the antagonization was almost compulsive on his part. Antagonizing Malfoy, while not an elagent solution, is fine. Insulting Snape when you know that he is going to take any chance to put you in detention is ill advised. Insulting Umbridge and going against her when you know that she has political power, nasty punishments, and is just begging for an excuse to expell Harry and punish both him and his friends starts to indicate that Harry is almost unable to stop himself, despite the clear cause and effect.

Antagonizing Voldemort just shows that he is a complete moron. You should not, in any case, tell a mass murderer with a gun that he has a small dick, so why on earth does Harry go out of his way to insult him.

All those people deserved the insults, I simply think that it is a major character flaw that Harry cannot keep his mouth shut quite literally to save his life.
