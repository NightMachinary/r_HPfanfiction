What it says on the tin: Draco completely misunderstands his father's and Arthur Weasley's relationship, and thinks that they're the best of friends, always pushing reach other to do better. As a result his opinion of their Hogwarts years is completely different to Harry. As a result, Draco asks Harry to be the best man at his wedding.

**** [[/u/CryptidGrimnoir][u/CryptidGrimnoir]] is correct. I responded to a prompt on here and wrote a short story in the comments as did a couple of people. My story definitely was just as you described though.

** Dear stupid idiot diary,

I'm so humiliated! I finally got up the nerve to tell Hermione i think of her as a mudblood, but she clearly didn't feel the same way, ughhh.

At least Ron's still close. Nothing comes between a big dumb Weasley and a Malfoy.

** Draco is sorted in Hufflepuff. Draco is in for a rude wake-up call when his parents try to disown him.

The golden trio will probably accept Draco in a "that's a weird but Harmless blonde" kind of way they tentatively accept canon Luna.

** The Draco/Astoria relationship from [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/aw0csj/draco_thinks_the_trio_are_his_best_friends/ehjhpku/?context=8&depth=9]] would be an interesting prompt, especially if Harry got with Daphne and has the same relationship as they do. Harry & Astoria telling the others off for their blood supremacy. Everyone else is just like; "Why don't you just swap? Why are you with Daphne/Astoria when Astoria/Daphne would be so much better for you?" And Harry & Draco just nod conspiratorially at each other...

Does that make any sense?

*** That does actually make sense and I think it could be funny... I've still got the original short story on my list of things to write and your suggestion would be a funny omake. Hopefully I'll get time to write properly soon and can do this.

  One of the things that many people have wondered about the epilogue was just why Harry and Draco shared a nod...
