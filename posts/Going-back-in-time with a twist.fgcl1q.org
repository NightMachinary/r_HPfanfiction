So, I had a dream about this idea and it won't leave my head since then. I thought about how in fics that take people back in time, the characters always goes with their full memories and level of maturity and etc. What if someone found a spellbook with a ritual to take someone back in time, and when they make the ritual the person ends up in their body, in the past, but not with their future mind? What if the spell gave them only some sort of 6th sense about what is "right" for them in that universe? So, if Harry went back in time, instead of remembering that Sirius is his godfather and is a good guy, he'd only feel that Siriu's story is not well explained, and for reasons he can't explain, he can't hatr him, even though he just found out he was a follower of Voldemort and killed his parents and all that crazy stuff on book 3. It's sort of like the spell doesn't take the memories across time, but takes feelings. Don't know if it makes any sense or not.


** What would be the difference to simply having gut feelings and/or vague premonitions?

*** For me, gut feelings are something that your brain knows or believes in, yet you can't explain the reasoning behind it in words. It's based on your current knowledge. Harry in DH had a gut feeling that Voldemort had a Horcrux hidden in Godrics Hollow, because he knew Voldemort better that anyone, yet he couldn't put into words why he had this feeling. Turns out, his gut was "wrong", there was not a horcrux in GH (there were other things, but the point is that gut feelings aren't always right). Premonitions I always associated with visions, and visions imply a knowledge from the future, acquired from them.

The way I see it, this magic works in a way that it's always guiding you to "the right path" and taking you to places you need to be, without you knowing WHY it works that way (sorta like a gut feeling, but it can never be wrong, and can't be ignored, otherwise it gets stronger). The same with people, you're thrown back in time with the same emotions your future self have, and you can't explain why you have such strong feelings for that person even if you don't know them or all the evidence you have should make you hate them, yet you have deep affection for that person

He was NOT wrong, because Nagini is indeed a Horcrux!

** Linkffn(Palimpsest by Larry Huss) should fit what you're looking for. This isn't actually time travel at all, but rather Hermione sends a written message back to her younger self, with very limited bandwidth. Is and will remain unfinished, the author sadly died in 2016.

** There's an abandoned Hinny fic like this. IIRC, Ginny goes back, and has random flashbacks. Possibly Harry, too? It's a cool concept that not many fics use.

Another one is Backwards with Purpose. Harry, Ron, and Ginny time travel, but it doesn't go according to plan due to [plot point].

*** What if it was divination? Harry went back in time, but then developed a divination talent that revealed parts of his own future memories. Bonus points for Hermione being both impressed and infuriated by his future knowledge (and absolutely vindicated when she finally figures out that he's a time traveler and not a seer).

** That's basically linkffn(12560378), but the part of non-completely remembered future is poorly written so for a long time the main hero looks like a complete jerk who lets Sirius knowingly rot in Azkaban and let her best friend (Ginny) be slowly mind-raped by the super evil wizard. Only later it is properly explained.

** I recall reading a Snily with this premise. The fic was dubious IMO, and also seems to be gone from ffn entirely (I can probably dig it up if someone wants to) nowdays. Basically, he goes back, but forgets his future memories, but not his future emotions and decides to follow what his gut feelings tell him (something very un-Snapeish IMO, and this was far from the fic's only issue). I think linkffn(Dreams of Future Past) pulled it off much better -- canon Snape sends memories to a younger Severus in a parallell universe, who makes different choices as a result.

If SS-centric (or LESS specifically) isn't your thing, there's a fic that doesn't really use your premise, but has a similar execution: linkffn(Ruthless by AngelaStarCat)

Instead of Lily's love protection, James casts a spell on Harry that essentially functions as a much darker, but permanent, Felix Felicis -- Harry's entire life is guided by "good" choices to ensure survival.

  1976 and nightmare visions of the future are plaguing Severus Snape. With Lily's help, he will need to figure out what these glimpses are trying to tell him, to change their future to a better one for all of the wizarding world. Although the future is not set in stone, not everything Severus sees can be changed, sometimes the inevitable will reach them sooner than they expected
