(First of all, English is not my native language, which is how I use Google Translate) Greetings, I am looking for a fanfic and I post here because I have not been able to find it in a conventional way, so the search is easier for me. The story was posted on fanfiction.net and it was not an ordinary fanfic, rather it was a list of plot bunnies, oneshots, and stuff like that that wouldn't really fit into a separate story because it was too short. I specifically remember a story there.

Basically it was the plot of the twins who lived, dumbledore says that Harry should be raised with the dursleys, blah blah blah ... and Lily agrees, only that James does not, since in this story he is the one who carries the smart ball. Outside of that, there are spoilers of what I remember from the story: Basically, he sends Lily into exile / seclusion since she was only going for lordship / money / influence in the government; He raises his two children the best he can, he removes his family from the influence of Dumbledore, he becomes an enemy of the goblins (and I don't remember how, but snape went to prison and in a gringotts chapter he makes him go free to take revenge) and founds his own school at home. So far is what I remember. Does anyone by any chance know what story I'm talking about?


** Wait wait, shit I know this one. Hold on, let me see if i can find it.

EDIT: I'm sorry, the closest I could find was "Dark Marauders" by BajaB.

  My odd ideas file. Little snippets that don't quite merit their own stories. Some funny; some less so.
