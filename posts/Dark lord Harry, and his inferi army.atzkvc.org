I'm not sure if this is on fanfiction.net or AO3 but I remember Harry is the master of death but he doesn't know it. He's unable to die and has lived for thousands of years.

The opening scene is fudge showing a caged Harry to Dumbledore saying that he's the ministry's biggest secret. Harry uses this opportunity to escape and start his war again I know he meets up with Voldemort and has a lot of inferi hidden around England.

He doesn't remember he's the master of death because of some deal he made with death to relive over and over to increase his magical core and stop the apocalypse or something like that

Any help would be great


** linkffn(Again and Again) This has parts if what you're describing. Harry made a deal with death to increase his power level and is reborn again and again but doesn't remember the deal. He tries something different every time. This time he's going to go over to the dark side and help Voldemort. It's a HP/TR slash with some smut but you can skip that I think. It doesn't have inferi though but he does take up the dark lord mantle.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

Is this one? I struggled to keep reading it because it seemed that the author was more into gore than anything else. Cool premise tho.

** This is two different fics. The bottom paragraph is definitely Again and Again. The second paragraph I have no clue.

*** Thanks, I realized it's a mix of again and again and the nightmare man. I haven't read either in a long time so I guess I must have just combine them in my head. Thanks for the help
