​

Ive only ever tried it once which was a Harry Potter and Marvel universe crossover but I based it on one of the AU universes where super powers didn't exist simmilar to the Powerless mini series so the explanation was that in this universe the characters were Muggle with no super powers

​

but how do you crossover universes with vastly different lore and magic systems ?


** There is no /best/ way to pull off a crossover, just as there is no /best/ way to pull off adventure, or romance. There are plenty of ways of doing it both wrong and right, and which specific scenarios are 'right' or 'wrong' depends on the story you want to tell.

Harry Potter's setting is incredibly flexible when it comes to crossovers. You have a lot of different options:

- Canon-fusion: This is where the secret nature of with Wizarding World allows you to crossover two settings without having to actually do any work at all. This usually means more 'small scale' stories set in our world. Lets say you want to crossover with Sherlock. Nothing actually needs to be done to make the worlds compatible, as there's nothing to say that Sherlock's world doesn't have a Wizarding World, or that Harry's world doesn't have a Sherlock Holmes wandering around London solving crimes.
- Minor-AU-Fusion: In this situation, it's maybe unreasonable to think that the two universes as per canon could be unaware of each other. Usually this occurs when the other world is larger than, say, a fairly self-contained town (I'd say something like Buffy is probably the limit between canon-fusion and au-fusion). It takes a bit of hoop jumping to make Buffy work with the canon Wizarding World, but with a few little changes to HP vampires they can slot together fairly painlessly.
- Major-AU-Fusion: These are a lot more work to get working because the two worlds don't match up at all. The Lord of the Rings + HP fusion would require a lot of work, and these will often end up looking very much like wholly original settings if done well. They're also relatively less popular, as the two fandoms being combined become almost unrecognisable.

The further down the fusion route you go, the more work you have to do to make it work. Major-AU-Fusion is basically the same as an original story as far as the work needed to make a good story. At that point it's less that you're crossing the settings over, and instead you're mashing up themes, character archetypes and tropes. Fortunately, there are other options. Why try and combine entire universes when you can just pull in some characters?

- Canon-Adjunct-Character-Insertion: Here, you take one of the fandoms, and you simply insert one or more characters from the other. You /reimagine/ their backstory within the setting of the primary world (so, for example, adding a 'Harry Potter' to Game of Thrones, who is the son of murdered Lily and James, raised by Aunt and Uncle). You keep the added characters approximately true to their original personalities, but you cut out all the bits that don't work in the new setting.
- AU-Character-Insertion: This is one of the more common methods, where a character is inserted into the primary world through some mechanism (the specifics rarely matter) which leaves their backstory fully couched in their original world. This is every 'Dimensional Travel Crossover' where Harry is blown up by Time-Turners, Killing Curses, Mirrors of Erised, or the Veil of Death, and wakes up in the crossover-verse.
- Don't-Explain-It-Character-Insertion: Loki is now teaching at Hogwarts! Nothing else from Marvel-verse matters, and the Wizarding World is unchanged, but Loki is exactly Loki. The story never even tries to explain it. Usually employed if the aim is fluff or hurt-comfort where grand scale events are largely irrelevant next to character drama.

Once you've worked out your setting, the next question is what to make the story. Again, you have many options:

- The-Story-Doesn't-Matter: To continue the fluff/hurt/comfort line, you can largely ignore the story of both universes (or solve them nice and quickly), to make space for some woobie fluff as a poor, tortured Harry gets the chance to reconnect with his 'real dad'.
- Hogwarts-But-With-Added-X: These run the gamut of significant canon-divergence, through to canon re-tread. The most important thing, though, is that Voldemort (or maybe Dumbledore, depending on writer preference) is the main bad guy. You then hit most of the important story beats (Death Eaters, Hallows, Horcruxes) but with some added sparkle being added by Edward's chiselled cheekbones. *
- Crossover-But-With-Added-Harry: Again, these can be re-treads of the crossover plot, or they can include significant divergence. These are 'Harry is now in Middle-earth and helps destroy the Ring'. You maintain the most important beats from the crossover's story, but throw Harry (and maybe co.) into the mix too. *
- All-The-World's-A-Stage: In this kind of story, the writer concocts an entirely (or partially) original plot to inhabit the crossover 'world'. Maybe it's a post-Hogwarts fusion, or maybe the addition of Supergirl as Harry's adoptive sister made the canon plot just fall over and die, and a new antagonist had to be added to give the story stakes.

Once again, when choosing between those options, remember that most readers are looking for Harry Potter (or Naruto or whatever) fanfiction because they /like/ those stories and characters, so you'll probably lose some of them if you decide to straight up drop the plots of both settings for something of your own.

Note *: These are naturally suited to Character-Insertion style crossovers moreso than Fusions, but they can still work for Fusions (especially Canon-Fusion or Minor-AU-Fusion). Think Sherlock helping Harry with the Horcrux Hunt, or Elsa teaching Harry Ice Magic to fight his Dragon in the First Task.

Finally, there's the knotty question of crossover metaphysics. Simply, if Harry and Star Wars are the same universe, is Magic the Force, but weird; is the Force Magic, but limited; or are they different things?

- No-Rules-And-It-Makes-No-Sense: In these stories you don't even consider how magic works in the crossover setting. It just is. This might seem unsatisfying, but magic in Harry Potter 'just is', so it's not completely weird. This works less well in highly scientific, or high-tech settings where it might stretch disbelief to accept that The Doctor cannot actually explain Harry's brand of magic.
- Same-Difference: Magic is the Force, only done strangely. In these settings Harry Potter is imagined as being the same as some fundamental force in the crossover setting. This /may/ end up imposing limitations on the Harry Potter magic being used that some readers dislike (for example in settings where magic is highly sacrificial). This is usually explained fairly up-front when the main characters meet.
- Keep-It-Secret-Keep-It-Safe: A bit like No-Rules-And-It-Makes-No-Sense in that it's never really spelled out how magic works, but by Jove you /have/ worked out how it worked. You see, by mutating the Marl-Boson, which can only be detected in highly Enquarked Fields, it is possible to warp reality in a manner similar to the Infinite Improbability Drive, only targeted. This might seem a lot of work when it's not going to be explained, but it can help keep consistency in power-levels between Wizard magic and Doctor Strange.

Once you've worked all those options out, you should be set. It's really quite a simple process! Unless you've decided on Major-AU-Fusion, or All-The-World's-A-Stage you probably have your entire setting and story worked out for you in broad strokes (and if you did choose those, well, you're either crazy, or were inspired by something miraculous anyway, so these choices are largely irrelevant).

I realise now that I've probably over-shared a bit.

Oh well.

** Depends on how you want to do it, really. There are two kinds of cross-overs: Combination and Transportation. Basically, either both fandoms exist in the same universe, or somehow a corridor is made between the two and they remain separate.

Transportation (ie. Harry wakes up one morning in the HP Universe, goes and does a leap through the Veil and then wakes up in the Star Wars Universe) is pretty simply 'balance'. Remember, Harry in that context is a magical being completely alien to that reality. There's plenty of consequences and weaknesses you can use to balance out any strengths you might give. For example, maybe there's no 'innate magic field' in this world and Harry exudes a weak one of his own, actually creating a battery-style limit to his magical powers. Or the magic-vs-technology thing. Magic shorting out electricity and creating explosions would be a lot worse on a Starship than in the middle of London.

Combination is all about finding what I call 'the mesh point' and working outward. Basically, it's the thing that the two universes have most strongly in common. The idea of that varies, so it doesn't have to be that they both do the same thing in similar ways. It could just be enough similarity that one can be replaced by the other, or that they could be added together and combined. For example, I'm currently writing a Life is Strange and Green Arrow fic with a combined universe. The mesh point there is as simple as a time frame - the Green Arrow is a superhero that spent five years on a deserted island, and in Life is Strange the main character is returning home after five years in Seattle. So, replace Seattle with the deserted island and start asking questions from there. If either fandom can provide an answer to those questions, use the answer they provide. If not, make something up or modify any fandom-based answers that are lacking.

eg. How did they get to the desert island? In Green Arrow, he went down when his billionaire father's yacht sank - the protagonist in Life is Strange is not a billionaire, so maybe they won a cruise? The Green Arrow fights to fix his father's mistakes, which doesn't work for Life is Strange, so something must've happened on the island. What happened? The Green Arrow was tortured by mercenaries, so maybe that could be similar? Why were the mercenaries there? Life is Strange has a powerful corporate type involved, so maybe he had some interests on the Island that he hired the mercenaries to protect? And so on and so on. In my case, I brought in elements of three other fandoms to flesh out what those interests were, and went through the exact same process of meshing and questioning to make that work too. And that process works for abilities and lore and everything else. Find the mesh point and the rest will follow.

*** In Marvel comics there are thousands on alternate universeswith some that are so different its almost unbeleivable

​

so I thought "well if there is a universe where they are animals or have no powers could there not a world out there in the Multiverse where a certain character was magical and shares his world with an AU version of HP universe

​

I dont kno what you,d class that under

​

thanks for sharing your thoughts its really interesting (:

And sure. Combination Crossovers are most of the fics I write, so I have a lot of thoughts on them. :)

so say you are crossing over a very dark and seriou crime show with another crime show but one that's more lighthearted and less serious

****** Sometimes I'll pick one or the other, depending on what's most appropriate for the story I want to tell.

Most often I'll interlace them together and bring them in and out as needed. Build up the gritty, dark tone in the discovery of the murder and the chase of the attacker, then lighthearted quips as the cops look in on the attacker sat in the waiting room, then bring in the dark again as they go in to do the interrogation.

Darkly toned stories don't have to be dark all the time, sometimes you need a break to laugh and joke before you get back to the horror (and sometimes that break can make the horror all the more... horrifying. :D).

** I don't know if there is a universally best way. I think the success of any comes with finding things that the two worlds have in common and going from there. How you make the two meet depends on the premise of the story and the characters involved

** In my honest opinion, Harry Potter is generally a bad universe to crossover with. Its magic is versatile, so much so that it tops any other magic system despite it lacking the wide scale or heavy firepower that is often seen in other interpretations of magic. Its magic system only works with itself because the only enemies people have to face are also wizards. The magic the enemy uses is just as versatile as their own. The only universes I can think of that could possibly stand-up to HP would be comics, which constantly deal with characters (magical and non-magical) who can alter reality on a universal scale (characters like scarlet witch in Marvel, or the specter in DC). So vast majority, if not literally all, of the non-comics crossovers would get their shit kicked in pretty easily.

Part of the reason HP magic is so versatile is that HP magic is trivialized, its usage has become such a massive part of their daily lives that they constantly use it for the most minor of things. It's rarely, if ever, portrayed as some mysterious cosmic force that they manipulate as opposed to something like the force in Star Wars, something that, while it isn't magic, still feels a lot more mystical in-universe than the way HP magic is portrayed.

HP magic is used freely, for even the smallest of things, and because it's used for almost everything with generally very little difficulty or consequences, it can just do more than any other magic system you can find. This is a bad thing for crossovers, because their magic will never be as versatile as HP and the only way for them to keep up is to learn HP magic. Which destroys a significant part of the reason in making a crossover in the first place.

At least, thats my opinion.

*** but is that really a hinderance because surley someone like Sauron and perhaps Jadis the white witch could go toe to toe with the Hp characters

​

also if Harry went to Narnia would his power fade like hers did when she first arrived

​

so he,d have to learn Narnian magic

**** In all honesty I don't know much about Narnia, and I only have passerby knowledge of LOTR. I'm not aware of any abilities either character has that can stand up to the majority of HP magic. Even if they are capable, I imagine Jadis is a high level threat in Narnia and I know Sauron is. They are the cream of the crop. How many other characters in either universe could stand up all the stuff we see HP magic users pull off? Even a common HP wizard would be almost invaluable in LOTR (and maybe Narnia, but I don't know anything about that).

As far as the losing his magic thing, maybe if you focused on his character more than anything else. That type of story wouldn't be a full universal crossover, just a character crossover. If his magic is no longer a factor, then the only piece of the HP series that actually applies to your story would be Harry himself. So you'd be tossing his magic as a factor out entirely and instead focusing on who he is.

***** Well Sauron is basically an immortal demigod and his master is a true god

​

​

and Jadis is a tough one because she loses her powers when she travels to a foreign world

​

so if she went to HP universe she,d need to go underground to learn magic

​

but if they came to her then I think she would steamroll most of them and if magic failed she would draw her sword or stone knife and leap into the fray with a battle cry

its quite fun imagining who could beat up who
