The "incompetent adults" trope is not exclusive to Harry Potter, but it is still a cornerstone of every book's plot. I think most of us realise that this is due to HP being a book series centred around three children/teenagers saving the world, but there has to be a way to address this issue in stories targeted at a more adult audience.

Generally, I'd say that there are several ways to work around it, each with their own up- and downsides.

1. Keep all adults incompetent and use it to show off how "smart" Harry is. Mostly used in OP!Harry bashing stories, but can be utilised for crack as well.

2. Make some adults (Dumbledore, Voldemort) competent. That, however, makes the rest stand out even more.

3. Make everyone smart. That, however, removes the conflict since the plot gets resolved without Harry&co.

4. Make some adults which are not related to the main plot competent and make them sympathetic towards Harry. For example Nymphadora Tonks, Hestia or Gwenog Jones or any other background character. This turns the story in toHarry+Background character vs the world.

What are your thoughts on the matter?


** 5) Make the Ministry the true bigoted shit hole it should be, so that Dumbledore and his Order really faced overwhelming numbers and a backstabbing government.

6) Don't dumb down Voldemort and Death Eaters (no 12 veteran Death Eaters failing to capture 6 teenagers in a carefully planned ambush nonsense).

7) Get rid of Deus Ex Machina, author fiats, plot armors, and most importantly, the â€˜lucky hero' trope.

*** Can I contest point number 6 partially? Preparation,timing,strategy and luck can enable you to win against dozens death eaters. Remember most of these death eaters are not fully sane after there extended stay in Azkaban. But I agree with you about Voldemort even though Horcruxes made him wonky he still need to be competent for a good villain.

**** In the DoM battle, the Death Eaters were the ones who were prepared. But of course, JKR had to let his kids heroes escape against overwhelming odds, so she had to dumb down the bad guys. "Accio Prophecy Orb" after stunning Harry is more than enough.

That's my core issue with the Series. Harry and co had too much luck, too little skills, and NO STRATEGY. JKR basically wanted a pure hearted hero who would rush into any dangerous situation without thinking. God forbid if they show political acumen, strategic cunning, and tactical ruthlessness.

***** I am not talking about book DoM trap. A good writer can make a competent Dumbledore who can make trap after learning that Harry getting visions from Voldemort and prepping Harry with prophecy Orb to attract attention. Knowing that Voldemort is way too much attached to prophecy. It might not be successful against Voldemort himself but it just might work against his minions. Dammit Rowling made Dumbledore fool at worst who rely on too much luck in book at worst or mediocre at best.

** Bureaucracy.

You can have 100% competent adult characters who keep not being able to act because they need to get a warrant, they need to fill out this or that form, they need to first have the Suchandsuch do the Thingamajig, they need to request permission to do the whatsit... etc.

Kids are ALREADY BREAKING THE RULES, and also are "just kids" so they are not bound by the necessary bureaucracy of life that always happens because at some point SOME ASSHOLE did a thing and then they had to make a rule about that and you know what they say about nice things.

In the same vein, there is such a thing as analysis paralysis. It might be the case that you have a bunch of characters, and the adult ones KNOW that, for example, "we could just raid Malfoy's house. We could just do that, we have magic and some ability to plan heists, distract people, etc." But... if you raid Malfoy's house, then he might come after you afterwards, or the ministry might start an investigation on you, or... etc etc.

It is /perfectly reasonable/ for an adult to be like "this plan is awful and we will have no part in it" /BECAUSE/ THEY ARE COMPETENT.

The smart thing to do (most consequences you want and the least consequences you don't) and the "right"/griffindor thing to do ("fuck the consequences to me next week, we need to stop this injustice /now/") are very often incompatible in real life, and the people who adhere to the latter go against those who adhere to the former all the time.

If you want an example, look at /any/ violent revolution, and you will find a bunch of people who aren't building guillotines or shooting up government buildings, but who are "sympathetic to the cause". Whether it be the French Revolution's "constitutional monarchies are nice, let's not go crazy" people, or MLKjr's "White Moderate" idea, there are bound to be people who want whatever the goal is (the thing doesn't have to actually be good, you could use this same model with everyday blood purists vs actual deatheaters) but do not want to do something outside of the established norms of discourse to get it.

Teenagers tend to not-be those people. Teenagers are easier to radicalize and often have a lot less investment in the status quo and a much stronger need to TAKE ACTION when they are mad about something.

Adults tend to have /more to lose/ if the thing goes wrong, and the caution that brings can create plenty of conflict without them being actually incompetent or even malicious.

** Make the adults competency reflect their reputations in universe, ex. wormtail is a passable wizard who is crippled by cowardice, Molly is an extremely competent mother who is somewhat blinded by overprotectiveness of children, Lucius is a fully trained death eater but is also a political powerhouse. Checks and balances is the name of the game, if your standard adults are competent at one thing, reduce their skill in another. If your good guy's are smart enough to see through the antagonists plan, give them a better plan. If need the adults to be limited in their actions, make a literal in universe obstacle to cause it, (ie. Fudge's ministry in OotP). The way around removing the tension from the story by making the adults competent, is to make everyone else competent too, and the way around having OP characters, is to make them have both specialties and shortcomings rather than just being good at everything. If Dumbledore is an extremely powerful and old knowledgeable wizard, then give him a fucking hernia or something else related to being old as dirt to make it possible for him to weakened so younger more energetic people have to take his place when his age catches up to him.

You ask you to make competent adults without ruining the plot?

Step 1. Checks and balances.

Step 2. Give your villains a better fucking plan than something that could be concocted by a two year old.

Step 3. Profit.

*** Also it doesn't hurt to give harry trust issues around adults to limit their ability to either help or interfere. Why trust issues you ask? Simple, every adult he knew until the age of eleven either actively abused him or failed to realize that that a skin and bones kid wearing dirty old clothes the size of tent and who was constantly picked on by his obviously more nourished cousin, might need some assistance with his living situation. In other words, he has no reason to trust anyone except Hagrid, (rescue from number 4 privet hell) and every reason to be skeptical of everyone he meets.

** Make the authority figures shaky allies or people with loyalty uncertain. If the MC doesn't trust them, their actions may cause them to leave their protection and end in some unintended result. Such as a bitter Harry that resents a competent Dumbledore (don't just use the same old edgey reasons) may rebel and their actions will have consequences, such as leaving the blood wards then allowing Voldemort to attack him.

Location of battles/conflicts is also important. Hogwarts should never be a home to conflict year after year. Lord Voldemort will not somehow manage to be incognito for back to back years in a school. This would never happen. That being said make conflict take place outside of the sphere of influence of powerful figures. (think Knockturn Alley rather than Hogsmeade)

Flaws in plans and decisions is not the same thing as incompetence. People make mistakes, just be sure that those mistakes are plausible. Dumbledore would not leave Harry unattended for 10 years. That's implausible. However Dumbledore may not realize that the wards would allow someone to collect Harry /without meaning harm to him./ That's actually a premise of a story (Blood Crest) which I can see actually happening. This is the sort of loophole or flaw in a plan that you can exploit to still allow conflict without anyone being an idiot.

Second, you lose the setting of Hogwarts and the framework of the canon setup. I don't mean Stations of Canon; but unless you make it about a completely different conflict that could realistically happen after the canon books, your story about an adult!Harry will still have had him go to Hogwarts, and so you need to somehow contrive events so that /none/ of the canon plotlines you'd want to exploit in your story were resolved during his schoolyears. And then you run into the other end of the realism stick, unless it's a heavy AU, which, again, I don't really like in a fanfic because it stops feeling like HP after a point.

I beg to differ. At least on this sub, preteens and Hogwarts era fics are not popular based on the [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/169NVDxmtgDuwB7O1rZenT_WfKWTJqs-k-cdxd37xHWw/edit#gid=00][top 100 most recommended fics from 2011 to November 2017]].

What is that rebellion trying to do? Smuggle muggleborns and halfbloods into hiding or out of the country, kill Death Eaters, destabilize Voldemort's Ministry.

What are the trio trying to do? Assemble the Seven Pieces of the Fifty Pence -- er, sorry, Voldemort's Soul -- so they can murder the guy.

They have related projects, but they're doing different things.

That's assuming Dumbledore left things to the trio alone. Let's say he left it to the trio plus several adults -- let's say Sirius survived, and he and Remus and Tonks are all in on it. Six people on the hunt. This means they can do more, but it doesn't leave them so flush with personnel that they can just leave the kids somewhere safe.

Dumbledore is a head of government, running a school, part of an international arm, and trying to lead a counter-terrorist organization.

The Aurors are a small police force that is no-where near equipped to handle a terrorist organization bigger than it is.

There really is only one Transfiguration teacher at Hogwarts, teaching 14 classes of 16 kids each. Even only teaching class once a week that would be almost three classes a day, have each class done 3 days a week you have them having to teach 9 classes a day + grade homework.

Fudge spends his days reviewing and authorizing building permits and other government minutia. The owner of the Daily Prophet has to spend all day every day casting duplication spells to get his paper out, so he can't do editorial control.

Exploit the HP Universe's complete lack of scale.

If you really wanted to go all out, the Wars have depleted the magical population to the point where they are stretching every working hour just to keep the lights on. The magical world is surviving on the prosperity of the past, barely surviving on enchanted items and previously produced goods. They can't dedicate workers to expanding quality of life because they need everyone they can just to keep the gears turning.

** Well, aside from friendly adults who /do/ befriend and help my heroes (Dumbledore, Sirius, Flitwick to an extent), here's my explanation: /the situations these kids get into are goddamn crazy/, and unless they witness them firsthand, any rational adult /would/ write it off as fibs.

Here's a concrete example. Fifth-Year. Put yourself in the shoes of an average witch or wizard, one who doesn't know Dumbledore personally nor has any ideas Horcruxes are a thing. Over a decade ago a terrible tyrant died. You know for a fact that no magic can bring back the dead. And there comes this kid, raised by unsavory nonmagic sorts, this poor disturbed kid whose parents were murdered by the tyrant. And when one of his friends dies in traumatic circumstances, he claims, with /no evidence/, that the tyrant has somehow /come back to life and killed his friend/? Come now, it's all very sad, but let's be realistic, the boy has /issues/ and that's all there is to it. Give him a Mind Healer and stop yelling. What's this, you say? Some old war hero supports his claims? "Dumbledore"? What, is that decadent ruin still alive? Well, it doesn't surprise me he'd buy into it. A broken old soul, and getting on in years... war does strange things to people, have you heard of how low Mad-Eye Moody has sunk?... And he was the boy's murdered father's friend, on top of that? Oh, the situation is quite clear, my poor man, these two are mad as coots, bless their souls.

If all of this still doesn't sound reasonable, transpose this to the real world and imagine they're talking about Hitler. A pauper kid whose parents were killed in the Holocaust when he was a baby starts raving about how Hitler's resurrected and is trying to kill him and is inside his head? A centenarian veteran alone supports his claims? /What/ are you going to believe in this situation?

If you start looking for this type of explanation you can find it everywhere.

On a more serious note, it wouldn't quite be the Hitler situation because we are sure what went down there. The Soviets were about to storm the FÃ¼hrerbunker when he took cyanide and shot himself. There's no coming back. But Voldemort? They never found a body and the kid who was in the same room got off with a scratch. He is gone, but there is little evidence to suggest that he was dead. The Potters were there, Lily's body "survived" but Voldemort's was gone without a trace? You don't need to be a conspiracy nutjob to see the holes in there.

** Large organizations like that have multiple friend groups and cliques that can and do have beef with other groups. It's a lot harder to get things done when everyone is interfering with everyone else for their own goals. To top it off, this is bureaucracy. Stupid rules, forms in triplicate, and multiple other things connecting departments means that there are hundreds of little ways for groups to interfere with the others' operation. Trust me, people in government are just as competent as anyone else, but they have a ton of shit to keep track of and it grows every day. It's very easy to get blindsided by that one vital form that you got five days ago but got buried under paperwork.

So, make them perfectly competent, but bury them in misfortune and petty grudges. Office politics are just as cut throat as legislative politics.

To extend this outside of the Ministry, CIRCUMSTANCES. They make or break a good plot. You can either make someone hold the idiot ball, or you can devise circumstances that force people to act in certain ways in certain situations.

So generalize this in a ways which are reasonable. So instead of Dumbledore being a total dingus and hiding the fucking Philosopher's Stone in a children's school, have him move it somewhere else but make it so that someone at Hogwarts knows where it is besides Dumbledore. That gives Voldemort a reason to come to Hogwarts that doesn't implicate Dumbledore as a buffoon.

Adults can be competent and yet mistakes allow for critical plot points to get you to the same general conclusions. It just requires a bit more thought and planning to see if it's actually plausible.

** You should start with making adults different.

As an example you can use this thread or any other about controversial topic. Usually there're more than two people with strong different opinions and they aren't scared to express it.

Most fanfic authors show only two points in their stories: the wrong one (villains) and the correct one (heroes). The real world is more complex than that. People on the same side still have different opinions about methods, expected results, timing, planning, etc. They argue with each other and it can affect their position.

If you take such heavy topic as "Chosen One" teenager, it's guaranteed that people on the Light side will argue about his role. Some (like Molly) will insist that a war is not for children, others (like Moody) will argue that every chance should be taken.

** I got a counterquestion: what (in your opinion) is a "competent adult"?\\
Because, most people hold people they believe should be "competent" to higher standards than themselves.

"Competent Adults", dont necessarily need to be strong or wise. But they need the ability to make decisions. Certainly not on the spot - but as it is supposed to be: based on deduction, induction and abduction!

In my opinion a competent adult will make a decision based on a mix of evidence, gut feeling and maybe slighty based on the influence of the people is surrounded by.\\
But being adult also means, based on what people expect of you, that you live a (healthy) and well adjusted lifestyle. It begins with your haistyle and ends with proper clothing. Waking up on time, arriving at work on time, doing said job properly. Dont live over your means. Being an competent adult also means that you accept the fact that there are people more wise and knowledgeable than you. You growth with your challenges. The rules dont say that you cant have help with that. And most importantly - what makes an adult a good adult: dont be afraid of rejection or negative comments. They will improve you.

But then again, all of this only really applies if you want to fit into a society that expects all of it from you.

The main issue in Harry Potter lies with the fact that all adults aside from 1 or 2 paradigms are displayed as weakminded sheep.\\
Magic not only seems to impair logical thinking but also the ability to stand up for oneself.

I'd say, throw in a couple of backbones and stop the adult characters from taking shit.

Any adult wizard can fight back. When in mortal peril any animal or human will fight for survival. They dont necessarily need to throw around Avadas. Cleaning spells into the eyes, polishing charms in the gonads, slicing spells to the arteries.

Life aint got a happy ending.\\
Dont forget that.

As we know most pureblood families are working in a way that would not be out of place in the early 18. century. Muggleborn also grew up in a household in which it was common for father and mother to have a job. They either learned their social skills from a nanny or Kindergarten (or whatever the British equivalent is).

My point is - you cannot expect the Magical World to fit in with your standards/expectations of the world.

Creating multi-dimensional believable characters is hard. Almost none of fanfiction writers can do this and very few of the professionals do this right.

Therefore this talk becomes being about author's skills. Unfortunately Rowling's are in another area. On the other hand it's very possible that if the books were about social laws they wouldn't become popular and we wouldn't have the HP world to read and talk about.

  I find, is studying cannon and theorising reasons why the teachers are so goddamn useless.

Canon apologism is the worst road fanfiction can walk on and I have literally never seen a fic that did it in any way that's interesting or compelling.

Write an essay instead.

**** appoligism is not what happens when someone tries to show reasons as to why canon happened from another perspective. Things can be wrong, canon can be wrong, but canon can also happen for a reason, or, Harry Potter can be an unreliable narrator. There's plenty to go with, and plenty of small things which could be different or could be different than as perceived by Harry Potter.

***** Right. I remember arguing with someone that even if Snape didn't have issues with Black, he still would have followed the kids into the Shrieking Shack. Any competent teacher would go to protect their students from a supposed mass murderer, that scene doesn't disappear just because Snape and Sirius get along during school.

**** I could not disagree more. Taking all the odd background things in canon and developing and fleshing them out into a coherent whole is the whole fun about fanfiction.

***** The problem is that there are simply too many plot holes and OOC moments to achieve a "coherent whole".
