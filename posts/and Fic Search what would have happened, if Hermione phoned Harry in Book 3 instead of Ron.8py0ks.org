This is a Discussion as well as a Fic Search. Ron is phoning the Dursleys in Book 3 and Harry wondered if Hermione would have made a clever process on it.

My Question is: would she really have a success? After all, any Person from "outside" the Privet Drive who wants to speak with Harry, cant be a "Good" Person for the Dursleys. The only thing i can imagine is that she would make several calls and every time hang up, if a Dursleys answers.

I would like to know your Opinion on this, but i would also like to know if there are fics out there that contain such a scene.


** The idea is that since Hermione understands the muggle world, and wouldn't yell into the phone like Ron, there wouldn't have been the same issues. She could, after all, pretend to be non magical (or give a plausible story) to blunt their anger.

*** She'd probably handle it better than Ron did, but that doesn't mean it would work.

The Dursleys are so sensitive and hair-trigger about Harry that they might not respond well to her anyway. Someone calling the house and asking to speak to Harry, when they're someone Vernon doesn't know and Petunia doesn't know and Dudley doesn't know...

She probably wouldn't get the “NEVER CONTACT US AGAIN” panic response Ron got, but she might easily get a “Wrong number, there's no Harry here”.

**** Very true, but wouldn't that raise suspicion when they claim not to know any Harry?

***** Over the phone, in a private conversation? What can she do if they lie?

“Wrong number”

“Harry's out”

Flatly hanging up on her.

In real terms, the Dursleys can say whatever they like to her. She might /guess/ that they're lying, but...

**** Perhaps, I'm really just copying what Harry thought about the matter (if I'm remembering correctly).
