Are there any fics out there with said pair and a "decent" plot and tension between them? i have some variations as "requirements" for it to happen:

1) Bellatrix is a criminal like in Canon, but not to such an extreme degree. Maybe Harry and Neville are Partners but regular "hire" Bella for help and advice. Neville gets attracted to her over time, but is uncertain if he should open to her. Probably Bellatrix notices his attraction and teases him about that.

2) Bellatrix never becomes a Criminal, but when she and Neville meet he still gets attracted to her.

3) Bellatrix is a (very good) manipulative character and its never clear, if she mean what she says or not, including teasing/seducing Neville.

4) i thought that might be a total AU fic with Harry/Bellatrix/Neville in a love-triangle. All three dont mind this condition, but unlike Harry, who sleeps with Bellatrix because she is sexy, Neville might develop more feelings.

5) Possible infidelity fics with Neville having an affair with Bella, despite being married or in a relationship.

As a note: i dont care about their age differences. So whether they are Canonical ages or Neville is older doesnt matter.
