Hi, I'm looking for Independent!Harry/Ginny stories that involve one or more of the following:

- Bondings
- Dark, but not Evil.
- Leaving Hogwarts' mediocre teaching to learn at a much faster pace (Some teachers are definitely good, but others like Snape just flat out suck)
- Powerful!Harry/Ginny

By the way, I would prefer that you post the fics you find regardless of your own opinion of them. I wish to be the judge of whether or not they are good fics. After all, what one finds disgusting, another may absolutely love!


** Ginny is my 2nd favorite character in the Books, and H/G remains my favorite pairing. So I went through lots of indy!powerful!Harry/Ginny fics:

*Abraxas*, linkffn(11580650)

*Aspirations*, linkffn(4545504)

*Elemental Harry*, linkffn(5648259)

*Harry Potter and Godric's Legacy*, linkffn(5270746)

*My Slytherin Harry*, linkffn(6160345)

*Taking Control Series*, linkffn(2954601;4924075), [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=129801][Prevailing Counterpoint]] finishes the series.

*The Bonds of Blood*, linkffn(5435295)

*The Thorny Rose Series*, linkffn(9631998;9969456;10288020)

Not all of your criteria apply, but they should be close enough.
