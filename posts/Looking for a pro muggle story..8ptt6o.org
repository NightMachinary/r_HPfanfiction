Basically a story where the character uses common sense. Verbally Abusive teachers(Snape), giant three headed dog(Fluffy), racism(Draco), and all sorts of other small thing that wouldn't fly in a muggle school actually get questioned, and pushed against. I'm not looking for an indy!Harry(i'll still read it, after all there is a reason so many of them are written), but a story where Harry takes one class with Snape, and then refuses to step foot back in there, because that s*** wouldn't fly in a muggle school, or where Harry actually starts trying to do something to try to stop the blatant bullying that Draco(and others) can get away with.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.


** Keep in mind, HP canon takes place in the nineties - almost two decades ago, a lot's changed just since then. As well, the wizarding world seems rather behind the the times in many ways compared to muggle. And finally, fact is, that shit DID fly in muggle schools in the past (minus three-headed dogs, obviously). That shit was STANDARD, accepted and /expected/ in muggle schools in the past. So, y'know, it's not totally unrealistic to say the wizarding world (of that time) is a place where that happens.

Can totally see why you'd want to read stories like that though, can't think of any atm besides robst's stuff but wish you luck finding some good ones.

*** I hate Robst's stories. There's no weight in it, no real tension, it's just so boring.

*** Actually, he has never written Harry that way, not even Hermione.

White Squirrel's [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/][The Accidental Animagus]], linkffn(9863146), has a Harry who takes no shit from anyone. He came in Hogwarts already with a large support base though.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

not so much muggles, but Harry creates a different society on an island:

I also vaguely remember a fic where Harry gets to dissolve the Wizengamot as a proxy of the Queen, but can't recall which fic.

  This is the sequel to Harry's Had Enough. You don't have to read that first, but it might be better if you do. Harry in a position on power, he's a bit unscrupulous in this one. Dumbledore, Ministry and Death Eater bashing. Also a bit of Ron bashing and general wizard society bashing. H/Hr. Now Complete!
