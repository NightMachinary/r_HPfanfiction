** Very. Hogwarts IS THE MOST SECURE PLACE. At other schools, their potions class is ultra deathly, their trolls are smart, and all the teachers are Lockharts/Umbridges. Their killing count is superior to sixty, their director doesn't know how to apparate (and doesn't know how to surfer in a boat).

** It probably is the best school.

Remember that Fleur Delacour was the best that Beauxbatons had to offer. She had 3 years of extra education on Harry so she should have known more spells and more advanced spell than Harry did. But when in the second task the two of them encountered Grindylows Fleur was defeated whereas Harry managed to send the hostages he had with him to the surface, fight them off and get out of the lake. The Gillyweed had run out around the point he sent the hostages up.

So if a 4th year student of Hogwarts can best the best other schools have to offer you get an idea how bad the others are.

Fleur Delacour a student albeit the best that Beauxbatons had to offer managed to do it alone. This puts her abilities way above your average dragon handler.

Most of the people who work at Ministry of Magic can't cast a shield spell. Harry could do better as a fourth year.

You can just imagine how bad how bad of a education most people had if school children from prestigious schools can do things that 10 of them could not do collectively.

Durmstrang actually doesnt have a Dark Arts class, and the only reason its location is secret is so people can't steal their muggle technology stash. Muggle Studies is mandatory so they spend time watching TV, legend has it they upgraded and now play games.

** Beauxbatons don't teach Astronomy, Potions starts only in 3rd year and Defense is an elective: instead, they have Dancing, Deportment and Arts as compulsory lessons till 5th year (Fleur putting a dragon to sleep through a dance-based ritual is impressive though).\\
Durmstrang spends the first year to teach everyone the dialect of Saami that is to be officially used in the school. There are no detentions, instead each offense is punished by a specific pain curse. Finally, their charter cannot be changed without the consent of every single ministry (or assimilated) of countries with at least a student or professor in the school.\\
Mahoutkotoro only teaches from 8 to 12 AM and 4 to 6 PM: 11 AM to 4PM is reserved for tea ceremonies.\\
Ouagadou forbids wands on campus; the best students can learn up to 50 spells wandlessly in 7 years (though they are good when it comes to Potions and Herbology).\\
Castelbruxo is deep in the jungle, and has no permanent buildings. Students are the best when it comes to herbology and CoMC.\\
Ilvermorny respects every single religious holiday, and ends up teaching for around 60 days a year. Teachers choose the language they use (Defense is currently taught in Pensylvanian Dutch, Potions in Haitian Creole and Herbology in Navajo).\\
Koldovstoretz was discovered by Stalin in the late 20s: since then, teachers are required to teach only communist magic, and anything discovered outside of the former sovietic republics is either "capitalistic hogwash" or "a produce of the jewish conspiracy" (with the exception of the anti-pimple potion, discovered by a parisian wizard during the Commune). The fall of the Soviet Union is predicted to have an effect in the next 25 to 50 years.

Minor schools are even worse (the Golbbled school for Goblins only teach Accountancy and Axe Handling; drawing takes 6h per week in the Chineese schools, along with a "Languages of the Himalaya" elective; an India school teaches all years together, but segregates by language;...)

** I actually had a discussion about this with my husband just the other day!! I feel like Hogwart's strength might be just how wide and comprehensive the classes they offer are. Students work really hard I feel, even before NEWT level classes. With 7 core mandatory classes, and then another 5 optional ones, of which most students take 2 or 3... Maybe other schools don't have such a wide study of Potions separated from Herbology, or maybe Defense and Chars are taught together at other schools, or maybe having access to Ancient Runes or Arithmancy is not so common.

Also I feel like the 4 core teachers, head of houses, for the main subjects (excepting DADA since we have the jinxed post problem) are shown to be quite exceptional in their field of studies. You have an Animagus for Transfiguration (and you had Dumbledore before that!), Flitwick is a duelling champion and always referred to as very smart and capable, Sprout really seems to quite knowledgeable in her area of expertise (to me 7 green houses talk about a huge variety when it comes to Herbology), and the last two Potions Masters where clearly extraordinary, Slughorne and Snape are both beyond capable.

If they could solve the DADA problem, got a new History of Magic teacher that actually engaged with the atudents, and Dumbledore encouraged Hagrid to stick to the more 'normal' creatures, then Hogwarts would have an almost perfect line up.

******* The Wizengamot seems to be modeled after the British parliament, which has a chamber with nobles in it.

The founder bloodlines are treated similarly to those of, for example, Alexander the Great. Examples for both Slytherin and Hufflepuff are in canon.

The whole pureblood thing has aspects of nobility. Obviously it is a racial equivalent, but the idea of a ruling pureblood class is not unlike a nobility ruling over the masses. Especially if you look at how purebloods control the Ministry even before Voldemort's takeover. That is certainly similar to the Roman nobility and their dominance over the Plebs in the early Republic.

France still has 4k noble families and the story of their revolution is well known. Even the Swiss have some 450 noble families left, with little more than their honorary titles. And they had been among the first to abolish their privileges.

And when the magical world seceded, nobility was even more predominant, so it stands to reason that there is at least a titular nobility in the magical world based on their ancestry. Which would fit in well with what Sirius said about the Blacks.

Except it will, by greatly increasing the number of muggleborns entering the wizarding world. If you think about it by virtue of having more in than outs, because there are obviously more muggleborns than squibs and half-bloods are always fully magical, then the growth in the wizarding world should be higher than in the muggle world assuming similar birth rates and child mortality.

The timeline does not match here. The last execution for witchcraft in the UK was in 1682. And magicals were basically impervious to them anyway, so that argument makes even less sense. I mean, there was even the one who got off from being captured and having to apply the flame-freezing charm to cackle madly while being "executed".

#+begin_quote
  child mortality.
#+end_quote

And that's where this argument stops working since Rowling said that magical people are immune to muggle diseases. So all those nasty things which were killing regular children had no effect on muggleborns.

And if you look at Harry's year, there are like 3 muggleborn (Justin FF, Dean and Hermione). So even if you reduce that number to 1/5th, that only removes 2/40 students from a year. And remember that Hogwarts used to have way more students back in the day, so that alone disproves your argument about population growth.

*********** My suspicion is that the opposite is true - prior to the statute of secrecy purebloods were 'boosting their numbers' so to speak by bringing in muggleborns into the bloodline on the sly.

Between inbreeding, wars and those who wind up as squibs/disowned - I expect the numbers are dwindling.

I reckon Voldemort took out half a generation between those who died over his reign. Look at the marauders year, then remember that the ministry had been after him for 30 years - and we know how slow they are to act. Similarly, he had a lake of inferi. Plus many Death Eaters were taken out, especially if you consider those who went to prison and therefore didn't have children.

I would put good money on dozens of muggleborns having returned to the muggle world or else fled abroad, too.

There's not enough people in Harry's year to sustain all the departments and jobs we hear about in, particularly as we know there's a subset of wizards who live off old money.

** Or Hogwarts could be the best because it has the potential to bring the best out of every student within the lines of what they themselfes consider the best. With the sorting every student is set on a certain path that will bring the best out of him. For Gryfendors its obiously they admire Courage and bravery and look what happend to neville. At the end he has a very good feeling of self worth and can act the way he always wanted, yet before was too shy to. For ravenclaws the loose Curriculum and vast library should be haven. For slytherins its a perfect playground to sharpen there sozial skills and as a plus they learn how to manipulate even when in a bad starting position (e.g everyone misstrusts them) and with always shifting circumstances and autority persons (different teacher every year). For hufflepuff its also a very good shool because they learn how to not be used by the other 3 types of ppl (houses) and put their trust in ppl that actually deserve it. How to not overwork and get burn out (again, no tight Curriculum but possibility of timeturner to test it) and how to network. Its the best school because not only has it the possibility to learn magic as much as you want on your own with additional challenges disguised as circumstance every year but also it has a huge focus on individuell sozial skill and its aplication.
