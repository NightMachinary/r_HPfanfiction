I re-read the end of Deathly Hallows a few days ago. When walking to what he presumes will be his death, Harry tells Neville to kill the snake, meaning for Neville to carry on the task of defeating Voldemort after his death.

So I wonder if there are any good fics that explore the idea that Harry dies and someone else (Neville, Hermione, Ron, Ginny...) takes over his role as the one aiming to defeat Voldemort?
