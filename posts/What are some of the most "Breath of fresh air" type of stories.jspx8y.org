Stories that actually feel unique. Maybe they twist original ideas, or make up their own ideas and you really liked how it was done. Can be Muggle, Magical, Canon, AU a mix of it or whatever.

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can be any length, can be old or new. Would rather it be completed or regularly updated but that's fine if it's not.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash/Threemsomes etc

Would rather NOT have Weasley Bashing/Weasley manipulation please. Though if it is, I'd rather them be minor characters.

Am fine with male pregnancy as long as it's not detailed.


** linkffn(What 's her name in hufflepuff) is quite unique. It captures magic that is fun and delightful, and it makes the characters seem much more human and alive than most fics.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

** I quite like the Alexandra Quick series purely for rehashing exactly /none/ of canon. Honestly, it could be its own series if the spell incantations were changed.

linkffn(3964606)

Victoria Potter also has a /very/ different approach to events and I love the worldbuilding - it diverges from canon enough to feel super-fresh and goes into details in a way that keeps me interested in how that world works.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First year complete as of Chapter 12.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22220911]])

I have yet to find anything like this one. It is a really intresting take on the wizarding world that really gives it a unique culture and not just victorian/regency era 2.0. And the teenagers acually act like teenagers, for good and for bad.

  The Dursleys have had it out for him ever since he was dropped on their doorstep. But Harry has Hermione, and it isn't so bad. Until she suddenly leaves him and enrolls at Hawthorne Academy. Then, it suddenly is. AKA the non-magical high school AU that nobody asked for
