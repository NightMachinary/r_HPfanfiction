I am mainly looking for something were Harry saying something along the lines of "You managed to find your way around my mother protection? *Who decided that*".


** Are you looking for a Pride-driven Harry Potter, a Sun-powered Harry Potter, or a Power-Wank in which Harry doesn't know the (so called) Laws of Magic, and therefore is able to ignore them?

Just asking for clarification.

*** I would prefer a one-shot really were harry gives Escanor's Who decided that speech.

I don't think the idea lends itself to anything more than a one-shot.

**** I think the idea of a Ego/Pride-driven Harry would work well for a 50-70k word retell of canon, however to come back to your request, I am afraid I don't know any such a fanfiction. Good luck in finding something along the lines.
