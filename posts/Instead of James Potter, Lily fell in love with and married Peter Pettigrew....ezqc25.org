** I can't see it, it requires Wormtail having traits that are desirable, which in canon he doesn't seem to have any. You'd have to retcon him or Lily somehow, unless he used the imperius curse.

*** Well, Wormtail managed to fool James and Sirius into thinking he was a trustworthy friend, to the point they made him secret keeper instead, and no one ever suspected he would sell them out. I don't think it's too much of a stretch to think he could have manipulated Lily into a relationship, especially when they were still in school and she didn't have much real life experience yet.

*** Agreed. Lily choosing Peter over basically anyone else is hilariously implausible unless you make significant changes to either character, or Peter uses Love potion or the Imperius. Even then I can't see him getting away with it, since people would likely notice.

***** Well, yeah. Obviously. People can love who they want, no one's disputing that. But it's also not exactly a radical idea to question what anyone would see in someone like Peter Pettigrew.

*** My headcanon has Peter as the Marauders' potions guy.

Pettigrew:

- Made the temp body of Babymort.
- Did the potions component for the ritual.

These two things sounds like something that you can't get talked through. Or blindly read the instructions while doing it. I also headcanon more stuff being required for the ritual. Like the liquid in the cauldron before? That can't be just water. That has to be something that spent months brewing.

Pettigrew isn't a potions master by any degree. But he had the potential for it if he didn't spend most of his life being a spy and a literal Rat.

** Poor Lily ends up with awful guys for some reason. I wonder how you'd make her marry him without noticing how awful he really is. I mean, selling out your own family is a different level of awfulness. Unless Peter becomes a charmer and manages to fool her. Or maybe like with Snape, she can make excuses for him. But marrying him is a bit too much because that's a different level of stupidity. Even if I do think she could pretend to not see things she didn't want to see. It would be interesting, though. Harry's own father selling him out. The shack scene would be impressive.

*** Womrtail has shown himself to be a great manipulator in canon. He was able to convince James and Sirius to switch him to the secret keeper instead (if James didn't think he was a good person do you think he'd risk his wife and child's safety by trusting him?), and he become a spy for Voldemort without anyone in the Order of the Phoenix ever suspecting him of betrayal. Everyone is questioning why Lily would be interested in him, but remember that until Harry's third year no one (except Sirius, and he was doing his time in Azkaban) knew how much of a terrible person he was. I don't think it's out of the realm of possibility for him to have manipulated her into a relationship, especially when they were still at school and everyone thought he was harmless.

**** i didn't say it's completely impossible. But it would be a story with a dark turn, not only because he betrays his family, but also because he manipulates Lily. After all, she managed to ignore what Snape was doing, probably convincing herself she can change him. As for James believing Peter was a good person, I'm not so sure. He might have simply believed Peter wouldn't have enough courage to join Voldemort. As much as I want to believe this was a matter of trust, I have my doubts. Sirius was the one who convinced James, and I have a feeling he said no one would suspect someone like Peter. That's hardly a compliment. The problem is that Rowling makes it clear we are supposed to dislike him, at least judging by that one memory we've got in canon. That just proves your point about manipulation. But it does make me wonder about the strength and sincerity of that friendship.

***** No sarcasm intended, but a dark turn is what I'm going for with this prompt. But the relationship between Lily and Peter was never my main focus with this prompt, I'm more interested with the reveal and aftermath. Especially with the fact that all four of the Marauders would be alive for it.

****** I see. But I think that the whole idea of him convincing her would be an important part of the story. It's one thing to convince people they should make you a secret keeper, but here we are talking about a relationship. They'd have to interact at some point. And since James fancies Lily, this would affect his friendship with Peter, I think. Also, there should be something that attracts her to Peter. Lily and James seem rather similar to me. I can't help but think it would all start with pity because I can't get that scene with the marauders out of my mind. I think there are other interesting things in addition to that reveal I'd love to know about. I have a feeling there simply isn't an HP fan who would be willing to put Peter in such an honourable role of Lily's husband. Some of them conveniently ignore him in the marauder fics.

I don't know. The whole "thrice defied" thing sounds like a major flavor of "defied". Would he really accept him? Especially being the father of the boy-who-has-hyphens?

Who was the secret keeper?
