** TOPIC: "Muggle Studies should be compulsory for all students."

Muggle Studies should definitely be compulsory for all students whether or not they are pure-blood, half-blood, or even muggle-born. Muggle Studies is an interesting topic since much like the other classes not taken by Harry Potter, J.K. Rowling merely mentions their existence every now and then without fully fleshing them out since the novelization focuses primarily on Harry's perspective. Due to the lack of available information on the subject, most of my points will focus on comparing Muggle Studies to real world subjects.

 

Muggle Studies is perhaps the most important class a muggle-born can take at Hogwarts. Muggle-borns first find out about the existence of magic on their eleventh birthday, that is a momentous realization that will heavily impact their life forever. Take a moment to remember what you were like prior to the age of eleven. From my own personal experience, once you reach the age of 20 or 30, you'll forget about the majority of your preteen years. Once the muggle-borne graduate Hogwarts at the age of 17, they will be so heavily disconnected from their roots that I believe they'll have a hard time spending time with their Muggle relatives.

 

#+begin_quote
  "Alecto, Amycus's sister, teaches Muggle Studies, which is compulsory for everyone. We've all got to listen to her explain how Muggles are like animals, stupid and dirty, and how they drive wizards into hiding by being vicious toward them, and how the natural order is being re-established. I got this one for asking her how much Muggle blood she and her brother have got." - Neville Longbottom
#+end_quote

The above quote mentions how the Death Eaters under the command of Voldemort perverted the subject of Muggle Studies. Although the method and topics with which the Carrow siblings taught the subject were extreme, I feel as if though they provoked a lot of debate between the students as to the merits of muggles or the lack thereof. If the professor was a tolerant muggle-born or half-blood, the pure-blood students could be led to question whether or not the muggles and their many advances of the past few centuries are worth merit. These students would then in turn question their xenophobic parents and even more debate would sprout which would ultimately lead the pure-blood hierarchy realizing that muggles have their uses. Since the pure-bloods, those who followed Voldemort, were indoctrinated by their parents, who were in turn indoctrinated by theirs, to hold to their ideals and to stomp out the muggle-borne, they never had the chance to learn anything factual about muggles which Muggle Studies would do and help break the cycle of fostering hate and xenophobia.
