"What was that about?!" Harry asked, shocked, his eyes still shut from the brightness.

"I don't know, he's never done anything like that... oh dear," Albus muttered. Staring at Harry, who suddenly looked like Albus.

Harry's eyes opened and widened comically, as he stared at himself. "You've got to be kidding me!"

Freaky Friday, starring Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter

** "So I see you know how to use the power of the office, Harry. Calling me to the headmaster's office and the sort."

The old man behind the desk sighed, "Look, professor, when we got into this I agreed to not tell anyone about the change for the time being, but you're giving me an odd reputation"

"How so?"

Harry narrowed his wrinkled eyebrows, "You know what I mean"

"You must forgive me Harry, I am not aware what this is about"

"Have you been flirting with Ron?"

"I beg your pardon?"

"You heard me. I gather Hermione is not happy. You would do well in not underestimating her, or her oppugno charm. I would rather not have my body harmed."

"That's ludicrous! I have never-- You know better than to listen to rumours."

"Don't forget I have access to the staff. Pomona is the biggest gossip, and Snape told me he got you in detention for drawing naked pictures of Grindelwald in class."

"I honestly was bored, I did get my NEWTs on Potions."

Harry sighed, "It's enough. Snape is in your pocket, I'm reassigning you to serve detention with Trelawney."

Dumbledore looked scandalized, "You can't seriously pretend... My boy?"

"That would be all Professor. And be thankful it's Trelawney and that Lockhart is no longer teaching in this school."

** This is an interesting idea, I wonder what some of the specifics would be? Do they keep their wands or can they only use the body's wand? IF they switched in GOF, that would be interesting to see the graveyard scene if "Harry" had to use the Elder wand instead.
