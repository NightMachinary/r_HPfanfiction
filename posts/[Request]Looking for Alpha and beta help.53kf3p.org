Hello there! I'm Airy and I am doing the dreaded "looking for beta/alpha help" post.

I started writing fanfiction in about 2006. I started a story called It's Almost Dark linkffn(5714834) in about 2008, when I was still in high school. Since then, due to a plethora of shenanigans, (such as living where I had no internet other than my phone) I was forced to abandon fanfiction for a while, other than to read it on my tiny phone. The last two years or so I have started getting back into writing fanfiction, which I love.

The thing is, I wrote the first chapters of It's Almost Dark when I was so young that I am a completely different writer now than I was then. Honestly, I read those chapters and I literally CRINGE. I refuse to remove the story because of the readers, but I am working on a rewrite before I continue the story - mainly because while the general story I am still committed to, there are lots of minor things aside from my writing abilities that have changes.

So basically, I am hoping to find some help with this.

I would love to find people that aside from beta reading in the editor sense, I can also talk to. Say, "Hey, I have this idea," and the person will be able to tell me, "Yeah that's great!" or "You're a nutjob." This doesn't have to be one person. Maybe a couple people, ideally.

I had a wonderful beta, unfortunately she was forced to step away from beta reading due to personal issues.

If think you could fill this beta shaped hole, please let me know! I'd love to talk about it :D


** I'd love to beta! I have been looking for something to beta for ages!

However, I freely admit that I do not know the specifics of beta'ing (Do you just give me things, I read them over, and fix mistakes? Or is it a thing that auto sends it to me on ff.net? I don't know the specifics of that)

However I am a great person to talk to. I think. Maybe. Please just say yes. I have no friends. :C

*** Generally, that depends on how much the author expects from you as their beta. Some only want their orthography checked (so grammar and and checking), some want the plot coherency and foreshadowing quality checked (so basically checking if it makes sense for someone who is not the author), others may expect something else, anything else really.

The way of fixing, likewise, depends on what the person you are doing beta-reading for wants. Some want corrections added to the text with a differently-coloured font, some want a list of corrections in a separate file, others may want you to just edit the original file and maybe or maybe not mark that in some way.

Just talk it over to be sure whichever it's supposed to be and you should be fine.

  Not DH compliant. This is the tale of Hermione Granger and Lucius Malfoy, and the story of how the entire world, muggle and Wizarding alike, was nearly thrown into darkness.
