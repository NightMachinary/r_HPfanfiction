Too often now have I read a fics about an abused child, or someone attempting to break deep-seated conditioning, and even with my (not expert-level or anything) psych experience, I can /tell/ that the author hasn't even looked into the topic at all.

And when I read these, and I /know/ that that is in no way how any of this happens, I can't help but think - yikes, man.

These are heavy, dark topics. Darker than any fic which self-describes as such is. In general, if you want to do anything to do with irl psychology, then you have to look that shit up. Just winging it won't cut it.


** I agree both with what OP is saying and with a lot of what I've seen in the comments so far, but also, being someone who's experienced first hand some of the types of abuse Harry suffered in canon and a lot of the common tropes in fics, I do sometimes enjoy reading just horribly inaccurate takes on these sorts of experiences and what comes after.

A lot of that, I think, has to do with wanting the content that comes with poorly written abuse angst fics (mentor snape, living with the weasleys, and other escapism fics are ones I particularly enjoy because, for me, reading fic is my own escape, and I like for that to be reflected in what I read.) I like poorly written abuse fics because, quite often, harry gets his happily ever after, and I get to read that amazing fluffy sweetness in whatever form it takes without being triggered, because if angst is written badly, it's not gonna give me angst. So I get to envision coming out of a horrible situation (or at least, someone else getting out of it) without having to relive a realistic horrible situation.

And if I'm in the mood for angst, not just the happy ever after recovery part, I can read really horrible scenarios and have a real grasp of how inaccurate they are, so again, it doesn't affect me too personally.

Well-written fic is always great to have around, and I love reading something and being utterly engrossed in it, coming out crying, and knowing that the author couldn't have done a better job than they did, but also. A round of applause for writers of bad fic, without whom some of us wouldn't be able to stomach getting to the tropes we really wanted, needed for our own form of escape.

*** thank you for wording this better than i could have! i second that. sometimes tropey bashing fics are good escapism bc it ends with Harry getting closure or revenge or power or friendship, and that's the kind of shit that's good to read on a bad day when you wish for those things for yourself.

** Gee, I hate to be that guy, but I feel like your post is a lot like if I, as an educator, complained about how fanfic authors need to bone up on pedagogy before they write a classroom scene. As long as the appropriate trigger warnings are present, I say BRING ON the half-assed psych treatments. It isn't any worse than what JKR herself did to teachers.

That said, immersion-breaking is a problem in all forms of storytelling, with almost every major field of work. Ever talk to a programmer about "hacking" scenes in TV and movies? Yikes.

So, just as a matter of good writing in general, it's helpful to look up /anything/ instead of winging it. I probably spend /too much/ time with historic "magic" to drop half a reference for flavor. It's the least I can do to look up, say, the actual symptoms of a panic attack before describing someone's reaction as such. Thanks for the reminder!

*** I was thinking the exact same thing. It can't be any worse then when I have to watch someone use a computer on tv or in a movie. I think there is a line though. You have to make an attempt. For instance, NCIS doesn't even try. Their computer stuff is all bullshit to every degree possible. So there is a threshold, but usually even an attempt is good enough to pass my sensors for it.

** Agreed. Far too much I see people either under or overestimating, both by large margins, the consequences of mild/heavy abuse.

Don't want to deal with it? Either make the Dursley's just be assholes to Harry and him being a bit shy and with adult trust issues.

OR just imply some stuff and give him the basic package of flinching, trust issues, and low self-esteem, without describing everything and steering the story away from it ASAP.

THERE, no need to describe in detail beatings and psychological abuse, canon already has enough of it, and you won't need to read some depressing psych papers and theory to write a believable character study on how Harry is healed from his childhood by love and support or how it makes him into Tom Riddle 2.0 (now with the 10+ charisma and the ability to love).

I just prefer to gloss over it a bit or make Harry have slightly different experiences than canon(like having a crappy bedroom instead of a cupboard).

Maybe I make a bit more aggressive and impulsive so when he gets magic he actually severely retaliates instead of just taking it.

But canon has no consequences from it. Not against the Dursleys, not against Snape, Harry's resentment of Dumbledore for the whole mess (including Sirius' death) doesn't even carry over from book 5 to 6.

** I do agree. As someone with formal training and personal experience with types of violence that I often see represented in fanfic, I find myself skipping chapters or quitting works altogether. A very obvious one is that people extravagantly overplay the physicality of violence without considering the psychological aspects which are actually far more terrifying, even to read about. The mental aspects are the scariest, and when I see fics like the Dursleys breaking Harry's arm and beating him within an inch of his life, I wonder if they realise that it's a bleak caricature that misses the worst parts completely.

If you wish to read dark fics with violence, realism is important in that it makes it darker and possibly also more meaningful to engage with themes critically. I recently wrote a scene where hermione survived an assault and has flashbacks in the shower. Fleur collects her, calms her down and pains her nails to distract her from the physical sensations she remembers. This is realism, dark, but also helps readers to be reminded of the reality that we as women face when we experience violence - and how we help one another and survive afterwards. We are people.

For children surviving abuse like Harry's, get online and read family law cases. Many cases are not as bad as the facts of his life, but still are devastating. If you want to write violence, look at the violence already available to us. One of the more upsetting cases I've had to read recently had very little physical violence. It involved a child being locked in a shed, not dissimilar to a cupboard. Also children of abuse in many fics are written to be meek. This is not realistic, typically. Look at care-experienced children, foster children, and our behavioural issues. We aren't a very meek lot.

One example of a work that contains sexual violence that is terrifying in its implication and actually very scant in the physical violence itself, is This Tangle of Thorns linkffn(12108523). This is a dark fic au, inspired by Lolita, with Tom riddle as hermiones step father. If you're only chasing violence for the yucky horror of it, it's much scarier when it's realistic.

That sounds terrible, but not in a qualitative sense. I recently watched PhilosophyTube's video essay on that book, and it just reaffirmed that I never want to read it. That sort of thing is for more inquisitive intellects than my own, honestly.

This entire topic actually touches on one thing I've noticed about fics which deal with real-world contemporary issues, like abuse or transitioning, which is that the fic does not really benefit from being set in this universe. For instance, a fic that has a trans!character will very often have them essentially take the routes present irl, with HRT and similar, instead of using the uniqueness of the setting to breathe some charm into the story.

For instance, I've never read a fic that dealt with a trans!character through a slow process of transfiguration, or with a psychologically-damaged!character through the canon (and fanon) mind magics. I think these would be great fics, honestly. The first would be an exploration of what it is like to be trans in the wizard world (ignoring that JKR is a filthy TERF), while not totally ignoring the setting or magic system, and the second would be an interesting explorative story about wandering and coming to terms with the damage to one's mind, but from a more active viewpoint.

The second story could be arranged episodically, with each therapy session being one chapter, and the story dealing with one specific thing through Legilimency - the therapist enters their mind, and they work their way through a representative mindscape, equating various "physical" things for mental traumas and treating them as they go along.

** IMO with EVERYTHING out of the ordinary in any fanfiction. Don't write about disablities if you know nothing about them, abuse or anything, just do some research first. I think I read one that said that because harry was autistic he was some incredibly intelliegent savant who couldn't be manipulated, which isn't what autism is at all. It can kinda kill a fanfic with these sorts of things.

** Hoooo, boy. Especially if the author wants to, say, give Harry PTSD, or other behavioral issues, and they feel like they have to "justify" it --- by piling on the hot pokers and belt scars for angst!points. It comes across as entirely excessive and honestly (imo) a bit offensive. And it's so, so obvious when they're wholly /un/informed.

Early childhood abuse can manifest in so many ways --- aggression, impulsivity, dissociation, hypersexualisation, etc, along with behaviors that no one wants to talk about +like, how many fics feature fecal smearing? if we're going for realism points,+ --- and it's not okay to completely brush the very real signs/symptoms of that in favor of "shy-and-stuttering-Slytherin".

** Or, as a general rule, if you are unfamiliar with a particular topic when writing, and you want to cover it in any detail, do some research.

If you want to describe some wood working, look into how the tools are used. If you want to describe a sword fight, look at HEMA and the like. If you want to include actual historical locations in detail, visit the place, or failing that do some reading.

** I would also add: you should think if abuse is even needed in your story. I've read so many fics that have a decent, well adjusted Harry and then just randomly throw in something like "oh, and then the Dursleys beat the shit out of him for three months straight", but then it never comes up outside of that. No revenge, no court cases, no screaming at Dumbledore. Just thrown in there because it can. In my opinion, that detracts from the story. And is also probably the most overused cliche in HP fanfic history.
