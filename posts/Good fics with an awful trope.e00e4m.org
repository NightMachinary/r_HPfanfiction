Can you recommend a fanfic which is of great quality, despite it being based on a shoddy premise/trope?

I don't know how about you, but whenever I see a fic with a Harry/Harem pairing, with mpreg, with a soul bond, I just can't bring myself to even fathom reading it. Surely you yourselves have similar preconceptions.

Are there any actually good fics along these lines which I'm missing?


** Personally I'm extremely sick of the WBWL trope, but I still follow the Prince of Slytherin, because it's amazingly well written.

*** Seconded.

​

Actually PoS makes good use of quite a few tropes I'm sick of, but I actually enjoy them in the context of the fic.

​

Except Hermione's parents being named "Dan" and "Emma". That one still annoys the piss out of me. But they're minor enough characters that I can overlook that one flaw.

** linkffn([[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7261904/1/]]) has powerful!Harry with a harem, which includes a submissive!occasionalDamsel!Hermione; it also has a manpulative!Dumbledore, Lordships that mean something, Amortentia!Molly, inept!Ron, declining wizarding world, and probably other tropes that am not recalling after all these years, but it's done in such a rich, imaginative, and entertaining way that I liked the fic nonetheless.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Meaning of One by Sovran [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/series.php?seriesid=54]]

Copied from a previous comment I made: Meaning of One is my favourite fic, period. It's a Hinny soul bond fic, which is rightfully a turn off for many people, but Sovran takes the idea and makes a gripping and emotional retelling of Hogwarts. Every character feels as if they have been ripped straight from canon while allowing for further intricacy and depth. The bond itself isn't prone to being trashy and tropey like similar stories, while Harry and Ginny do become fast friends, their developing relationship is tactful, believable and ultimately wholesome as hell. The bond's mechanics are developed early and have a complete set of pros and cons that don't derail the story into wish-fulfillment, it even addresses puberty in a way that is in-depth yet mature and reasonable.

I'm surprised with that with the amount of times I've recommended this, it hasn't become a meme yet.

  Here's my contribution to the ridiculously contrived, trashy, marriage law genre. This one involves Lucius Malfoy and a muggle stripper, with snarky commentary by Percy Weasley. Rated M for some sex scenes.

** In the Firebird trilogy, harems and soul bonds are the norm, not just a one-off thing for Harry. It's set in a massive and well thought out AU where everything relating to the changes is well explained. It's the only harem fic I can legitimately say is good, because the harems and bonds are seen as a dystopian element - the witches use them to establish control over wizards. The story is about Harry and friends bringing down the system.

I'll admit, the first few chapters being so AU was hard for me to read the first time, so it took a few tries to get into it. So give it a go, stomach your way through until you understand what's going on, and I promise you that there's a brilliant story to read.

First one: Linkffn(Firebird's Son: Book I of the Firebird Trilogy)

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13092314/1/The-Gates-of-Azkaban]] is a great fic with the following: Marriage law Mild bashing (of the potter parents and Ron) And super smart Hermione

That being said the author is damn good and the fic is a sequel to a fic that's really good. There bashing feels justified by canon, the marriage law is treated with horror, and Hermione has flaws. It's set in an au where snape lives. Highly recommend.
