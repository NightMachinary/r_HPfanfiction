** I have read this series, and really enjoyed it. However, it had one fairly major flaw that made it a bit of a slog to get through - no matter how the author changes Harry, it never affects canon at all. It has a lot of potential but doesn't really make use of it in my opinion. Still a good read though, and it's been a few months since I read it so it might not be as bad as I remember.

*** The 2nd part completely diverges from the Canon.

The 1st part begins diverging after Year 4.

But I agree, it's still a major disappointment.

**** A bit more harsh than I would phrase it...but essentially true. I've read far, far too many canon rehashes to do it again.

** Seriously y'all, this is a wonderful series. You might have seen some of the individual chapters floating around on FFN as well.

** Mm, I can second this recommendation too.

There's not much that shifts from the stations of the canon (except for The Children That Chose Themselves), and they all read more like story outlines than proper fics, but they're still pleasant and not too demanding to go through.
