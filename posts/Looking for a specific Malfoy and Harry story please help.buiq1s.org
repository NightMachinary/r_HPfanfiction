It's a Malfoy and Harry story. I think the title was *Broken Bones* or *Broken Hand*, something like that.

Okay so here's the story: Bored Harry is forced to volunteer at a hospital by Hermione because he is doing nothing with his life. Malfoy works there as a successful young doctor (healer) who people begrudgingly respect. That's because he solved a common problem that people thought impossible, helping old wizards revert the process of their bodies degrading and losing their magic. Anyway, Malfoy hates Harry, so he makes him do annoying chores like fetching stuff or fight giant dust bunnies. Over time, Harry learns more about Malfoy, like how he used to date Luna and they were going to get married, but they lost their baby and their relationship got ruined. It all gets juicy, when hogwart's students come down with some sort of disease that makes their magic go wild. After much drama and detective work, they find out it's not a disease but a potion. In the end, the culprit is Neville, the teacher! There's a battle, he's arrest, and Harry decides to become a nurse and stay with Malfoy.

Hopefully someone here can help me find this specific story. I have been looking for a while now and I just recently found out about this subreddit. Thank you!
