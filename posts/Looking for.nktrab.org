Only read the start of it before it before I lost it and can't find it again. Essentially, Harry enters another dimension (or goes back in time) after a number of years, and has to basically fuse his memories or soul to a younger Harry Potter (who's he's metaphysically latched onto) to avoid destroying young Harry Potter's soul.


** Harry Potter And The Nightmares Of The Future Past had something similar I believe.
