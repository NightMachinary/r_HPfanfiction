Are there any fics out there that have a Harry that is smart and calculated, but still a nice and relatively approachable guy? It seems like people's can't make Harry more ambitious and cool without making him an obnoxious jerk.


** Sounds like Harry in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin)

Its weird that even by the age of eleven, he is contemplating murder. But everyone pretty much likes him with a handful of understandable exceptions. Later on his people-skills are /somewhat/ explained, though not till the middle of 2nd year at least.

When I was in elementary school I knew a kid who crucified a squirrel, or a rabbit, or something, to a tree in his backyard. He always said stuff like "I wish you were dead" or "I'm gonna kill you", and he always looked bored when he said it, but that just made it creepier.

I'm just saying, psychos are kids at some point too.

**** To be fair, kids lie about stuff like that because they think it makes them look ccol/badass/awesome/rebellious/etc. Doesn't necessarily mean he actually did anything at all. People who talk about that sort of stuff are actually the ones I /least/ worry about. I know /that/ from personal experience too.

And in defense of kids, they don't quite understand the implications of long term actions. I suspect most of them cannot really even contemplate the idea that they might actually die or go to prison. Sort of like an invincibility mindset.

Maybe that explains why Harry in canon is so screwed up. When he was eleven, he almost died loads of times.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Well, my story has a smart and calm female Harry, who's also a very kind and compassionate person! Of course she can get stressed or fly off the handle like anyone can, and then she gets snappish and sometimes also cussy at people around her. But she always tries to say sorry. :) linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12784998/1/The-Fight-For-Rights]])

** The issue therein lies with the age of most authors aswell as their range of reading materials.\\
If you vary your reading materials, your writing is also going to change.

That being said I recommend linkffn(7619993) aswell as many others of the fanfictions Fringeperson is writing.\\
Linkffn(5698899) features a slightly older Harry. It may take some time to get into it, but it is worth to read.\\
Linkffn(5371934) features a Harry that stands up for what he thinks is right instead of being a smart shit.

Maybe this one doesnt fit but I enjoyed the Harry it featured nevertheless linkffn(9094199)
