  Harry and Ron are successful Aurors working at the Ministry. But when they are assigned to a new case by their temporary boss, whom they despise, they can't imagine the changes it'll bring to their lives.

*** I mean Romione is the only relationship that developed properly in canon (Except to some extent Hinny).

Its adorably infuriating to find someone hating Romione but jumping on Dramione.

Thanks a lot for your recs I have read a couple of them and from the author's list too but thanks a lot!!

  In the search for Hermione's parents Ron is stricken with an unknown curse. The experts and family all agree that Ron is brain dead, alive only in a shell of himself. But Hermione refuses to believe that her soul mate is gone, fighting to find him and bring him home. Ron, meanwhile, is fighting just as hard to get back, falling more in love with his witch every step of the way.

** I've written a number of Ron/Hermione stories. You might like "The Granger Principle" and "Divided and Entwined".

*** I have read your work and I am a big fan, milord xD. I haven't finished Granger Principle but Divided and Entwined is a piece of art. Though I don't think that Harry would ever like Hermione romantically, your stories are canon itself lol.

Pleasure to make acquaintance with you!!

  It seemed like a routine assignment for CI5 officers Ron Weasley and Harry Potter: Investigate a physicist who had caught the attention of some unsavoury elements. Little did they know that Dr Hermione Granger would turn out to have more secrets than Ron would have thought possible.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
