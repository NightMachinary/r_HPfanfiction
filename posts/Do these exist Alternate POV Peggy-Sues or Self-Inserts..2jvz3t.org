Has anyone ever come something like this?

Self Insert or Peggy Sue fics written from the POV of another character. AKA Harry one day notices that /Greg Goyle/ (or any other character that isn't all that close to Harry) suddenly seems to be acting very differently towards him (or even just using his words in Goyle's case). He later finds out that "Goyle" has been replaced by some weird dimension traveler who seems hellbent on helping him, but also /REALLY/ wants to get him and Hermione together. Harry's feelings on the subject of his sister in all but blood don't seem to be important. I suppose it would come out as a parody of SI or PS fics and shippers in general.


** Well, there is Too Many Time Travelers by Lord Jeram in which about every character except Harry Peggy Sues. It's a pretty fun read, but maybe not exactly what you are looking for.

*** After just skimming page 1, it sort of is, at least on the Peggy-Sue front. Tho it seems to have been taken to the extreme. Also everyone seems to be about as subtle as Ron usually is so far.

**** It's very much a comical over the top piece, but it's a fun enough read imo.

*** It seems to be from Su's POV though or rather third person following Su. I was wondering about something like that, but from the POV of someone who isn't the self insert. Like a Harry's POV tale of Su Li's self insert. Or Hermione's POV while a Peggy Sue Harry takes over in X-year. Going more for the canon character trying to solve the mysterious abrupt personality change/replacement, and further assuming that the SI or PS is trying to keep it a secret from everyone.

<EDIT2> okay, yes. The parts from Harry's POV are what I was looking for. So, this, minus the Su Li POV parts.

**** Yah, the POV switches around quite a bit. I don't care for that aspect of it, but otherwise it reads fairly well.
