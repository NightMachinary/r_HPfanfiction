Hi, I'm looking for a story I started some time ago, I lost all my links when my computer crashed. The story is an AU, Voldemort won the war, Hermione's parents were killed and Hermione is now a slave to the Malfoys. The fic was all her POV, and fairly long. The author's note was a warning for very dark (torture, abuse, etc.) and a bittersweet ending, no one really recovers from this--definitely not a true love, happily ever after fic.

I remember a few bits I read: Hermione--and I think Ron--were serving at a banquet and they had to carry around heavy jugs of wine to refill glasses; she was sneaking sips when no one was watching and was led away a little tipsy. Bellatrix attacks her at one point in the story and leaves her dying out in the garden. Lucius finds her and heals her. She has a lot of interaction with Lucius, including first time sex. I don't remember any other characters other than Lucius, Narcissa, Draco and Bellatrix (and possibly Ron), but I did skip around chapters a bit and planned to come back to it later when I had time to read.

Thank you for any help tracking this down.

*** Well thanks for traumatizing me for the rest of the week. That fic is so fucked up (but fucked up good, like a morbid obsession).

*** That's the first HP fanfic I've ever read, and I feel like I've been punched in the gut. Total literature hangover; going to need some tea, a fuzzy blanket, and my dog for the rest of the day. Gahdam.
