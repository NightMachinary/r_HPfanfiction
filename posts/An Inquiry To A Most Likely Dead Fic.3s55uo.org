I'm currently reading/I read 'Child of Mercy' by Fayr Warning linkffn(2596747) and it hasn't been updated in 7 years. Anyone here who knows the author if the author is still writing, fallen out of love with the franchise or that RL caught up with him/her? It is an amazing story.

I've honestly never seen a story that uses Potter like Fayr and provided Potter with a superb supporting cast.

Writing wise, the author badly needs a beta at the time of writing the fic. Otherwise, the way Fayr writes is captivating.

Anyone knows what happened to him/her?

** That started out interesting and then for some inexplicable reason Harry couldn't use Charms...

I know it's AU but I wish authors would put some kind of tag when they change Harry's abilities like that.

*** Have you read the rest of the story? There's an explination for it and it is pretty unique IMO. Too bad its dead.

Unless this is seen by the author, so it has a chance to live.

**** I skimmed the last 3 chapters looking for an explanation but didn't see it. And since it was abandoned I left it at that.

***** It was explained in the 6th I think or was it 5th? It was during an old goat conversation and the nurse IIRC...or was it Mcgonagle? It's explained and how Potter adapted.
