** Well:

linkffn( [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2686464/1/To-Fight-The-Coming-Darkness]] )

is a good one, one of JBern's best, but some people don't care for his writing style.

linkffn( [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7594305/1/Triwizard-Tales]] )

is one of mine, a bit of crack with a big heaping scoop of silliness for the Triwizard.

linkffn( [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3230439/1/Thank-You-Ms-Bones]] )

one of Old Crow's best

linkffn( [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3882344/1/Not-the-Only-Redhead]] )

A LOOONG story, more than 330k words.

Lots of others, but those should get you started.
