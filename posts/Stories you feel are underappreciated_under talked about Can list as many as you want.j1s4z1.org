Can be on any site, anyone can be the main character, can be any length. Can be from any Era, can be older or newer.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash/Threesomes and the like are fine.

I'd like for it to be completed or regularly updated, but if not, that's fine.

Smut is fine, plot is fine, slow burn, or fast or in between is fine.

Feel free to link them anyway (someone else might be interested in them):

But: As far as restrictions go:

For male pregnancy, I'm fine, as long as it's not detailed.

I do NOT like Weasley Bashing (As in Weasley's are using Harry for his fame and fortune, are going behind his back, et cetra).

Edit: Note: If you don't link the title, I'd appreciate showing the title as well as who made the fic, just so it's an easier time to find the story.

** This is one of my all time favorites. And I am constantly amazed by how few reviews it has. It deserves thousands but has less than 300. You should definitely try it out.

  The morning after defeating Voldemort, Harry finds he wants nothing more than to be left alone. However, angry goblins, dementors, and a well-meaning Minister make this impossible, imposing on Harry more responsibilities than he wants... and then some.

  Single point of divergence, one-shot. The Death Eaters succeed in getting the Prophecy to Voldemort, and this rather changes matters. Lord Voldemort wants to kill Harry Potter, yes, but he won't be the toy of Fate.

** Linkffn(Amber and Emerald) I think the only "hermione stuck as a catgirl permanently" fix I've ever read that's not an excuse for shameless smut. And a rare no bashing whatsoever fic. Unfinished but I still enjoy rereading it on occasion cause it does cover a good bit between the poly juice mishap 2nd year and Halloween 4th year.

Linkffn(in spite of obstinate men) and linkffn(in spite of appearances) serious slow burn harry/fleur no love at first sight/veela bond/soul mate/marriage contract etc tropes and no bashing either. Appearances hasn't been updated for awhile but the author writes a lot and o ly updates when he feels like and if you ask when he doesnt write on that fic for a bit.

  Response to whitetigerwolf's Polyjuice Cat challenge. When Hermione is told her Polyjuice problem is permanent, Harry refuses to let his best friend go through this alone. He chooses to drink a similar potion, and the consequences of that choice are unpredictable and far-reaching. Rating for later themes.

  The House of Black still stands. The House of Black will always stand. But what happened after Hallowe'en 1981? Dynastic feuds, family politics and maybe, just maybe, a hope which can be found in the dark of night, and the darkest of hearts. Not your typical Sirius-has-a-daughter story. Rated M. Complete.
