I am working on a Harry Potter/Persona piece and am looking for characters to fill up the use as confidants. The plan is to, like the games, give them their own stories/arcs in line with the arcana they are linked with (on top of the main storyline).

I have 6 more slots left and would like to fill them with characters most don't normally see explored in fics. Please offer suggestions?

[Characters I already have are:: Hermione, Sirius, Tonks, Remus, Luna, Snape, Draco, Neville, Trelawney, Parvati, McGonagall, Ginny, Ron, Dumbledore]


** Don't forget confidants outside of his normal circle of friends.

Tom the Bartender, a Goblin, a Centaur, Ollivander, maybe Stan.

In P5, there was the (spoilers) detective, shogi player, politician, and doctor All kind of outside of the Phantom Thieve's circle.

** I can't think of any characters to add in right now, I just wanted to say that your idea sounds really cool since I'm a fan of both. :)

- Magician: Ron

- Priestess: Hermione

- Empress: Katie Bell

- Emperor: Lupin

- Hierophant: McGonagall

- Lovers: Lavender

- Chariot: Angelina Johnson

- Strength: Ginny

- Hermit: Sirius

- Fortune: Trelawney

- Justice: Susan Bones

- Hanged Man: Hagrid

- Death: Dumbledore

- Temperance: Tonks

- Devil: Fred and George

- Tower: Snape

- Star: Tracey Davis

- Moon: Neville

- Sun: Luna

- Judgement: Cho Chang

*** These are interesting, thank you. I already have my set up for most of the arcana though.

•Fool: Igor

•Chariot: Hermione

•Death: Sirius

•Devil: Tonks

•Emperor: Remus

•Empress: Luna

•Hanged: Snape

•Hierophant: Draco

•Moon: Neville

•Priestess: Prof. Trelawney

•Star: Prof. Burbage

•Sun: Parvati

•Temperance: Prof. McGonagall

•Tower: Ginny

•Strength: Ron

•Magician: Prof. Dumbledore

•World: Lilian

I am still looking for characters to fill the: Hermit, Fortune, Lovers, Justice and Judgement Confidants. I think Susan is a good shout for Justice but I think it's also a bit unoriginal and easy so I haven't put her there yet. Though I am considering her as a Persona user. And I did really consider Dumbledore for Death but he really just IS the Magician.
