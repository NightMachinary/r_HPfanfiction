So yea. Any help would be appreciated.For the record I have read The Shadow of Angmar linkffn(11115934).

I would prefer Harry being OP, MoD would also be nice(Optional).


** Have you read the other HP/LotR fics by steelbadger?

linkffn(The Power He Knows Not by Steelbadger) is a Harry/Eowyn story, where Harry has been chilling in Middle Earth for some time until a battle stumbles upon him (literally). It's very well paced, and if I'm honest, I like it a bit better than The Shadow of Angmar.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Elves Most Fabulous) is the best HP/LotR crack around. Features lecherous, elfling!Harry fucking things up. Extremely entertaining, highly re-readable.

  Elfling!Harry. Except not. Jaded and cynical Master Auror Harry Potter gets sent to Arda to relive his non-existent childhood. Childhood sucks. Rated M for language.

  A decade ago Harry Potter found himself in a beautiful and pristine land. After giving up hope of finding his friends he settled upon the wide plains below the mountains. Peaceful years pass before a Ranger brings an army to his door and he feels compelled once again to fight. Perhaps there is more to be found here than solitude alone. Harry/Éowyn.

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

** My favourites are:

- Back to the beginning by CrystallineX, where retired MoD Harry somehow finds himself in Arda in a female form, then proceeds to help the fellowship kick a few arse... linkffn(10131514)

- The Black Wizard by Hi Pot and News, featuring teenage fem-Harry who gets plonked into Arda by the gods to solve a problem for them. linkffn(10055643)

- And In the Darkness Bind Them by EpikalStorms, featuring immortal MoD Harry... linkffn(9674362)

And then there's The Return, by Ronwyn the Queen of Darkness, featuring MoD Harry who merged with Sauron and subsequently enters Arda as the resurrected dark lord. If only the author would continue the story... linkffn(10003320)

  He's been stuck like this for a couple of beginnings, and so many ends. Millennium have passed by and his age never changes, his skin cannot stay pierced, his body cannot die; thus locking his soul, binding him forever to this existence. This stranger comes into their lives, and they're unprepared for the events that follow after him. Viper is an interesting enigma. Immortal!Harry

  The Valar chose many companions to help them create Arda... save for Námo. The Judge of the Dead chose only one companion, who eventually pled for eternal rest. Too bad Námo had different plans. Eons later, Harry Potter woke up in a field of grass. "Sodding dreaming potions..."

  After the Second Wizarding War, Harry goes to Middle Earth for a little R&R away from it all. He was told it was peaceful. He was wrong. He then spends four years fighting in the North. When the Ring is discovered, a war for the sake of two worlds begins with Harry at it's centre. I own neither LOTR or Harry Potter and would be a good deal richer if I did. THE SEQUEL IS NOW UP.
