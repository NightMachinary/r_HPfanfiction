Since I'm bored of Ron being a brainless idiot in every fic I read, are there any that place him in the limelight?


** I can't say that Ron is the main focus of this story, but he's definitely not an idiot and there are a few scenes where he's a total bad-ass:

** linkffn(Checkmating by mahaliem) Try this one, Ron's still capable of miscalculating things but he's a lot smarter than most fics portray him as.

  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Cannon to Epilogue, then not so much...

  It's been said that little things can change the world, and they can. But then, so can big things. This is the story of the big things that happen when Ron Weasley meets his mother's cousin, the Accountant they don't talk about. Ron learned that there is more to life than magic. Sometimes a skill gained by accident is all you really need to change the world.

*** Ugh, this story is so stupid. First he gives Ron the superpowers of the flash (awesome) and then he never once uses them in any significant way.

What's the point then?

***** I dropped out after first year when everything went exactly like canon.

- The duel with Malfoy
- The troll
- The dragon + detention in the forbidden forest (which he also wasn't there for)
- The philosopher's stone
- Ron getting his kicked by a giant chess-piece.

And not even "what would the Flash do in this situation?". No, it was event for event the exact same plot. He never once changed anything or used his powers in any meaningful way (or at all really).

** I wouldn't say that he's in the limelight, but linkffn(Forging the Sword by Myst Shadow) has awesome characterization of the trio. He's not quite super Ron, but he grows as a character throughout the story, and it is (unfortunately, some might say) not even done yet.
