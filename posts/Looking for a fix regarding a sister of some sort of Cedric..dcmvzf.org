:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Think it was situated during the Triwizard tournament. Cedric used to have a very good friend who died and his last wish was that Cedric takes care of his sister. During 4th year Cedric and his "sister"are the only ones who support harry. Anyone know what fic this was?


** I seem to remember something like that in this, I could be wrong, currently packing so I don't have time to reread it to check, if I am wrong, sorry I couldn't be more help.

  Harry becomes an outcast during fourth year and ends up reaching out to new people to help him along the way. What he ends up with is a girlfriend and a new lease on life with the freedom he has never had before. The title refers to Albus and the Order. Grey Harry
