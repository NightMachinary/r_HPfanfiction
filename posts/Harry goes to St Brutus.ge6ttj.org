Long shot, but are there any good fics where Harry goes to St Brutus' - either as a secure centre or special school? Maybe he has difficulties, or maybe his accidental magic got things confused? Potentially he then needs to be integrated into Hogwarts.

I had an idea for such a fic myself, but am a terrible writer so it's not practical. I'd much rather read a someone else's hard work!

  In 1991, Harry Potter begins his time at Stonewall High, unaware that he is anything more than a boy prone to freakish accidents. When he turns fourteen, he will receive a letter that will change his life. He will learn he is Harry Potter, and be invited into a world where belonging is his birthright. Until then, he stumbles on, two steps forward and one step back, out of the cupboard and into the life he was never meant to have.

**** Thanks! I'd actually read this fic earlier the same day and really enjoyed it. Not quite what I was looking for, but very much worth a read.

** Not exactly St. Brutus, but in linkao3(The Perils of Innocence by avidbeader) he gets thrown to some kind of mental institute by Dursleys when he is five or so. Lovely fluffy story, WIP (but there are /occassional/ updates).

  AU. In an institute to help children with mental and psychological problems, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

*** I'm a few chapters in and pleased it didn't stay focused on Harry being 5. It's far more like what I was after than I expected.
