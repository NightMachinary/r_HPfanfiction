** Hello, I mainly want to encourage you. What else have you written? (Link please). And how long do you intend for the story to be? I can't take you up on your offer becaue my tastes are so different and it may not be fair to you to suggest changes to your work based on my preferences. I'm just not good at that. But I am very interested in non-con with great characterization and story setup, that actually has a story to tell and a convincing incentive for the rape instead of mindless violence. Nothing wrong with that in fiction, just not my thing. I'm intrigued by your pairing and hope you can pull it off. Here's a [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1083897][short]] (original) sample of my idea of noncon and a [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15208766/chapters/35274458][long]] (HP) sample, in case you'd like to discuss things. Good luck with your writing, I would like to take a peek when you're finished.
