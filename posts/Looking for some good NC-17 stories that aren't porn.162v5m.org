Basically I want to find some well-written "adult" stories where the sexual content adds to the plot rather than consuming it and sounding completely gratuitous.

My turn-ons include:

- Canon stories with canon ships
- Hogwarts or post-Hogwarts era
- Femme-slash, so long as it's not silly or gratuitous

Turn-offs include:

- Dramione, Snilly, Drinny and other highly implausible ships
- "Harem Harry" stories where everything with two X chromosomes and a pulse throws herself at him
- AU stuff that's barely recognizable as being related to the books

Thanks for your recommendations!


** I hate the weird words people have made up for ships. When did Draco/Ginny turn into Drinny? EDIT: Drunk.

** [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/os7ng/tonksremus_fan_fiction_consequences/][Consequences]] is a great one; canon-compliant, canon ship, Hogwarts era, and an actual adult relationship with adult characters that rings very true. But no slash, and no trio. You're gonna love it anyway.

** For me, implausable ships make adult situations in plot-driven fanfic that much more intriguing. It's one thing to see Harry and Ginny getting down, and another to see Hermione and Draco overcome their mutual distrust in order to come together.

** Do you mind slash? If not, [[http://theguestroom.houseofhobbits.com/hp/sohw.html][The Shadow of His Wings]] is one of my favorite fics ever. Post hogwarts H/D, Harry is a professor, as is Draco, Voldie is still alive and kicking. Not at all fluffy, the romance is relatively deemphasized. Sadly abandoned, but quite long.

*** Thanks for the recommendation, but superpowers are another turn-off I should have listed above. Nothing ruins a story faster for me than when Harry suddenly becomes more powerful than Dumbledore plus Voldemort times Merlin to the Galdalfth power. To me, those stories always read like the author didn't want to deal with Harry's fight against Voldemort, so they just made him super-powerful so he could get back to boinking.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/649126/munkeymaniac][Munkeymaniac's]] stories might be up your street. The romance geneally plays a significant role in the plot, but they are plot-based fics with some small amount of sex.
