Best one I know is "Blue Magic", which has Liara raise Harry. I remember that it was good but also abandoned before the main Voldemort conflict arose. Still, quite a few "awww" moments and general goodness because someone takes care of Harry.

Not in the fashion I described, but there are a few where Harry (or Hermione) fixes the other universe. "Harry Potter:Geth" has Harry in the Mass Effect Universe and is a very amusing read, although it kinda fizzles out towards the end. "The Winter Witch" has Hermione join Robb Stark at Riverrun, and it was good, but I haven't read the new arc (Chapters 20+) yet. There are a few other lacklustre Game of Thrones ones, but nothing I'd recommend.

The only scene I remember is an exiled HP being called to Hogwarts by Draco and LV. Maybe to renew a contract/pact/vow. This happens very early into the story, might even be the prologue. I pictured Harry having a super long beard, like an actual exiled wizard style beard, but that might have been in my head. Also HP and Draco might be old. Like mid-life-for-wizards, or actually old. I don't know for sure.

  A single-/dual-point-of-departure spinoff from Less Wrong's brilliant story "Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality", branching away in Chapter 81. Hermione is sent to Azkaban, but Harry is not about to give up. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like his enemy is about to leave things alone either.

** within harry potter my favourite tropes are slytherin and/or darker hermione if it's done well, no ‚Äúwe still hate muggleborns but we love you because you're a slytherin and ron and harry take the place of malfoy and call her a mudblood‚Äù and unexpected families/friendships. i love time travel fics as well, ones where she actually changes things not just cries because she has to let james and lily die or let voldemort rise to power. and most of all if harry, ron and hermione are friends in a fic i want them to actually be friends who love each other and are dedicated to each other, none of this bashing or ron ruins everything or hermione is a perfect saint and those two are just mean.

and just in general i love fake dating, mutual pining, accidentally married, and ragtag bunch of misfits form a family. and witchcraft aus, whether that be harry potter aus or urban magic or magic in general, i just love reading about magic.
