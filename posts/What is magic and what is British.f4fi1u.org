So, Matgopack has put me onto a really interesting thing I didn't really know. Apparently lots of non-British readers who were unfamiliar with British Culture saw a lot of the more quaint, traditional aspects of canon (Houses and House Cups, Prefects and Head Boys/Girls) as less current-British and more 'Ye Olde Magickal Culture' and I find that very interesting. Especially since the localised prints of the books themselves often made that association, too. I was curious, how many of you think that kind of thing (Houses, Prefects, and so on) isn't done these days, and how many of you were surprised when you found out they did?

Because it's not uncommonly done. Even my chavvy near-failing small town shithole of a Secondary School did all of those things, as did my Sixth Form College.

** On my end, it's something I really only realized a while ago from reading a paper/article about the French translation - I think it's [[https://www.erudit.org/fr/revues/meta/2006-v51-n3-meta1382/013553ar.pdf][this one]]. Although I disagree pretty heavily with some of the conclusions of it - or at least, someone I was discussing the article with on reddit, it did make me think of how things got associated with 'the magical community' instead of just Britain.

I might have been a bit too categorical earlier, too - I'm sure there's a lot of people to whom Harry Potter and Britain are very much entwined, as all the 'Brit-pickers' on this forum should attest to! Reading it in French first might be part of the reason that I'm a lot less picky with the british aspect of it.

Oh, and for an example of how something like 'prefect' got integrated into the French text, [[https://prnt.sc/hv76xi][here's an example]].

Oh, I imagine there's a lot of both. It's a popular series, after all. You simply got me curious how prevalent the 'localisation' was. To give an example from that first paper, it is immensely strange to me that the Sorcerer's stone book uses 'mom' instead of 'mum' despite still being set in England. I don't think I've ever noticed another book series do such a thing.

*** Not really. There's about a hundred and thirty of them and they're usually on the posher/smaller end of things (That's out of 33000 schools across the country, btw) in GCSE and A-Levels. Neither of those figures include University, as Boarding is a part of that experience in most cultures (Student Dorms and Halls and whatnot). For clarity, GCSE and A-Level is almost always done before the age of 18 here (adult learning is a thing, and always to be applauded), and A-Levels are regarded as a 'prep' stage to whatever comes after (University, Apprenticeships, etc). The school ages of those boarding schools does vary, though it's mostly teenage range, there are some that go earlier. It's also quite common for those boarding schools to have what are called 'Day Students', essentially they're the ones that get to go home at the end of the day.

The Low Teacher Population of Hogwarts is something weird to English kids too, in all honesty. It's an artefact of Rowling's writing, not a cultural practice. A class of thirty or more would be uncommon here, the average class size is about 20 or so in most primary and secondary (elementary, middle, and most of high) schools.

I definitely agree that they're not comparable, but my schools certainly got into it. Always in a moderately sarcastic, mildly mocking way, but we did get into our arbitrary competition between our arbitrary groups. That care always did persist though, even outside special occasions like sports days and the like. House points and such were a thing in both schools, so it kinda bound the thing up a bit.

**** 20? The average class size, including where the number has been brought down in rural areas, is 27. The exception is A Level classes.

The Scottish School I last worked in had a class of 36 and no teaching assistant. Though only a few years above and the class sizes were tiny due to fewer births.

Incidentally, not many board schools do GCSES/A Levels - they tend to favour iGCSEs or the international baccalaureate.

Scotland has their own qualification framework, too.

We had head boys and prefects at my in England and I hear its much the same here. Ours were done arbitrarily in primary school, but we were asked to think about our group values and the like within our teams and we competed every week on class activities, sporting and house points could be lost like in Hogwarts. The shame if you lost points. Our house shields were ranked on the wall and every week in assembly the shields would be adjusted. It was taken very seriously.

In secondary, our forms were done alphabetically (not our classes for actual lessons, except PSCHE) and there were two houses to each form. Except one, who just got double points. My brother's year had an extra form to even it out. We only really used them for sporting and attendance, however our forms met three times a day (morning, after lunch and at the end of the school day) and so people became very insular within forms.

Although with less interest in the values, we certainly were encouraged to see ourselves as distinct groups. We had someone swap forms once and the rage an outsider was coming in. Although that was partly because we were second on attendance, almost about to overtake and we got the biggest skiver in the school in hopes our friendly form might encourage them to attend. They turned up twice. We pled to have them removed from our scores, but no luck.

We did also have a loose association with achievement but it was more complex. 10 merits for a commendation, 10 commendations for a distinction, 10 distinctions and you could attend the end of year event at a special venue and get an award with your parents and whoever they sponsored to come in. So commendations and distinctions were counted.

***** Ah, my bad. The 'twenty or so' statistic is just Secondary Schools. Infant/Primary is the 27 average. I did have to check official statistics to verify that though, so it's quite possibly just government finagling, but I haven't read the whole methodology of the census yet to check for any bias like that.

Oh, I forgot about the shields! Jeez, those things were ridiculous. Did yours have the little silvery shields on it for the actual engravings? Like, around the edges?

Three times a day? Christ on a bike, that's a lot. My secondary school lower site (Yrs 7-8) met twice, but after that we only ever met once a day.

** Since I started reading the books at age 11, I thought it was a magic thing, since USA doesn't have any of this stuff. What's funny is I didn't really make the connection that Harry Potter was British until I saw the movies and even then it didn't really "mean" anything to me since the only thing I knew about Britain is they had a strange accent and we beat them in the revolutionary war. As I got a little older and learned more about other countries, I realized Harry Potter was British and therefore the things and words in the books that had seemed confusing or special were there because of British culture,. But I still thought houses/prefects etc were definitely "england past' and not "england present" until many years later. I was surprised to learn people still do stuff like that. It seems so strange and old-fashioned.

Side Note: Parakeets are still "budgies" to me. All because I accidentally ended up with a UK-written library book that used the term "budgie" at age 11 LOL. It was several years before I realized nobody in USA uses that term, they all use "parakeet". It's very, very easy to learn all kinds of things when you're young and have no idea if it's from your own culture or another culture, you just blindly accept it.

Officially, "parakeet" refers to 115 different species. But if you walk into a pet shop in the USA or someone is talking about their pet, they'll say "parakeet" and they mean budgie always. I kept several parakeets as a kid. It's the only common pet bird that looks gorgeous, but doesn't have a lifespan of about 600 years, so it's the most popular type of pet bird.

****** While I would love to own one of the large birds like scarlet or blue and gold macaws, hyacinth macaws, etc, I've never been in a position that I can guarantee that I could take care of such a bird for the 50+ years it would live. The larger birds are high-maintenance and live for a very long time. Dogs are no where near that level of maintenance. Even owning a horse is more practical to me because you can pay to board it at a stable and let someone else take care of the day-to-day stuff. Which a ton of people do because not everyone wants to live in the countryside, or have the money/time to build and constantly maintain their own barn and lands.

I suppose things like tortoises are less maintenance, but long-lived. But I've only ever cared about dogs, horses, and birds. Birds require so much attention and care, whether you're talking macaws/parrots, crows/ravens, or any of the hawks/falcons/raptor species. Parakeets (budgies) are the only "colorful" bird that takes minimal care and they're only a commitment for about 5 years or so, hence why they're soooooo popular. Budgies can live longer than that, but its rarer in pet birds because of mass cheap inbreeding for pet stores. Mine never lived very long as a child. All of them came from pet stores that were clearly mass breeding these things like disposable napkins. The average cost of buying a budgie is just $20, so you can see why they're seen as disposable napkins.

​

Also, that's assuming you have children at all to pass animals to and that they're even interested in inheriting it. Not everyone wants to inherit a high-maintenance, long-lived bird.

** Yeah, there's some fics I've read where it's pretty clear that the author thinks there's some remarkable about school houses. I mean, we had them at primary school too (albeit four houses instead of six as at college). Of course, it's a bit different because I never went to a boarding school but even so.

Well, I mean, we didn't have prefects in the HP style... we had house leaders and there was no guarantee you'd be a house leader the following year (also, I think we might have elected them). And we had two head boys and two head girls. At least, at college... in primary it was just the house leaders.

Mind you, there was no running inter-house sporting competition (and while there was some kind of House Cup thing at college I could not tell you who won any of the years I was there). Closest would've been a tapuwai tournament when I was 13, but that was probably over a few weeks (not the whole year).

We kind of had house segregated classes. In years nine and ten we did English, maths, science, social studied and PE in house groups (three houses had three classes, three houses had two classes). The other subjects were mixed. Our version of home room was also on a house basis, the admin of the school was house oriented and so forth. Quite important really.

Great fun, though having vaguely Maori terms yelled at us in a Northern accent was distractingly hilarious (my PE teacher was two steps from an "off t'pub wit' t'missus" stereotype accent).

Huh. I don't think my schools every segregated classes by house-groups, only 'homerooms' in which we'd have a House Tutor who took the 'homeroom' and a Head of House who oversaw the whole House. Our classes were streamed by 'academic ability', groups one (being the smart fuckers who did well on tests) to five (being the bordering on PRU-attendance delinquents and/or those experience severely self-destabilising issues).

**** Okay, the way it worked when I started was we all did an entrance exam (which they got rid of the next year) which was the primary or possibly sole basis for streaming. I actually know who had the fourth best score (one of my friends) but, as a rule, they never told us precisely where we came on this. The best you could do was tell if you were in the top 28 (the "super advanced" class), the top 56 and top 84 people because we had core classes of 28 people total (well, mine was... for the most part anyway... and I assume the others were too). Although possibly it was just top 28 and top 84.

Now the school did (does?) rotate the cores through the houses so one year the advanced class is in the yellow house, the next the green, then blue and so on. Any of the houses with one of the three advanced classes would have three core classes instead of two. The houses with two core classes were "mainstream" and as far as I can tell these were a completely random sorting... no ranking (so one mainstream class hadn't done better than another). Certainly, they jumbled these cores together between Y9 and Y10 whereas the advanced classes were mostly preserved (iirc there was one person demoted, another promoted and a third who just did advanced maths).

This system did bias things in later years as well because, for example, to do advanced maths in Y11 you needed to have been in advanced maths in Y10. This wasn't the case with science but since this went from three advanced classes to one there was still a preponderance from the super advanced class (and at least one person who had previously been in a mainstream class). And in the optional Y11 subjects you obviously could only do classes with possible timetables... so if you were in multiple advanced classes in Y11 you were exposed (in class time) only to people with compatible timetables.

And, of course, people tend to make friends with people in their classes. So, obviously this biases new friend formation to the core subjects and therefore people in the same house. But there were two timetable cycles (as far as we could discern anyway) in Y9 and Y10 and these were broadly house aligned too. So, most of my friends from outside my own house were in the red house since my tech, PE, art etc. classes in Y9 (and to somewhat lesser extent Y10) tended to consistent of people from my house and the red house.

It's a bit hard to remember now since we all had the exact same uniform, but there is a caveat... mostly I only knew the houses of people I was friends with (and thus knew which core class they were from). So, this is probably going to play up the house biasing in those optional subjects. I will say my Y11 History class seemed a right mix... but then few people in my core class did history.

So... some people weren't sorted randomly into their house but were instead destined for a particular house because of where they'd been streamed. And everyone's general choice of subjects would have made being in certain houses more likely because of the way the timetable cycle worked. There was, for example, just the one German class (although I always had the impression a number of people were stuck in German because of the timetable rather than a desire to study it).

** I view the whole houses and prefect thing as more of an old society sort of thing, probably because only one of my schools had houses and nobody cared about them in the slightest apart from on sports day, and even then only barely. Nobody that I know that went to a different, public school had houses. No clue if new schools have them, but I certainly view it as a more private school thing, or public schools with posh aspirations.

**** It's actually the Britishness input that is helping me, more than the actual quotes, I don't know if that makes sense. You see, I'm supposed to talk about Britishness in the books, and I'd started talking about the Muggles and the Public Schools and the likes and then this thread comes out and... apparently Prefects and Houses aren't Magical stuff but something I should pay attention to. It's been very enlightening, so I thank you a lot. I'll have to find the original texts (I'm not a native English speaker but I try) to see exactly how much they're different from the translation I have. Case in point, the article matgoupat linked up above, which I will /absolutely/ quote because it's exactly what I needed. I will be sure, however, to ask for permission to anybody in the thread who I want to quote, thank you for pointing it out! And thanks!!

***** Ah, okay. Fair enough. That does make sense. I've currently posted another thread ([[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/f4x7ei/best_of_british_britpicking_britticisms_and/]]) that you might also find useful for Britishness indications in the books. And also a place to ask any questions you might have too. :)

******* You might wish to do a literature review on the translation you read - for instance, I linked to [[https://www.erudit.org/fr/revues/meta/2006-v51-n3-meta1382/013553ar.pdf][this paper]] about the French translation of the books. There may be ones for your language - so no need to reinvent the wheel!

That being said, you are probably going to need to read the series in the original english. Aspects of the 'british-ness' will always be lost in translation - particularly vocabulary. Eg, 'mom' vs 'mum' for american vs british english will likely both be translated the same way.

******** Indeed, I will probably have to compare my version to the original one, and I had considered it. However, the entire scope of what I was missing still wasn't clear. See: the public school structure, head boys and many other points the paper you linked talks about. I'll have to take more accurate stock of what I have and see if there's other mentions in my tongue as well. Thank you so much for your help!

** I used to think that house, prefects etc were specific to magic culture and only realised that it wasn't when I started researching for fic writing. There's probably a lot of other things that actually exist in English schools that I attribute to magic, but I couldn't tell you what since I can't compare to an actual English school..

Also one thing that confused me while reading is that in the UK public school are considered more posh than private, whereas in France public is free for everyone and private is pretty expensive so private is more posh, because of this it took me a while to understand some of the comments..

*** The public / private split in the UK comes from tradition. When schools were first founded they tended to be associated with cathedrals and larger churches, and entry was restricted to boys who could sing well enough for the choir.

Public schools were founded to allow everybody - or at least, everybody who could afford it - to study. The name stuck even as the fees got larger and larger and so even though it costs over £42,000 for a year's education at Eton, it's still called a public school.

** I know this thread is almost a week old but I went to school in the US and my school district had a house system. This was public school, and I think it was mostly a way to deal with the huge number of students rather than a tradition.

*** Oh really? That is interesting. Do you mind if I ask what state you're from? It's my understanding that school districts are mostly autonomous (the American obsession with grass-roots governance) but generally similar along a statewide base.

***** I admit, this stereotype is second-hand as a English person, but isn't Minnesota supposedly heavily influenced by Canada? I know there's actually a place there called 'Little Canada', but I've heard jokes about the whole state being similar. If it's an accurate stereotype, maybe it's an influence from Canada?

** I always thought of it as a magick thing, like in Finland they have a class president, which was one person voted by the class to be the responsible kid, whom you could take suggestions to, (rule changes and what to do with extra moneys) those changes would get put into consideration by the cpg (class president group, head of group is a teacher) and the cpg would then make changes / argue why it was a viable option or why it wasn't or just straight up dump it. They didn't do any actual disciplining, that was for teachers, but they were mainly a way for students to have some control in their education.

The point system was the same, but we just completely ignored having one, mainly because the point system is fyckin ridiculous and stupid.

(It matters only as much as the students want it to matter, also if one makes a mistake then everyone gets punished for it, but that's my opinion)

Though I admit it would have been an interesting experience
