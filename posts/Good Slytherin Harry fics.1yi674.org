** A few others:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School][Hogwarts Battle School]] by Kwan Li (215k words, book one is complete but book two is WIP).

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort is in power, but the Wizarding World fights back. Harry Potter, Master of Death, is faced with a choice, move forward or change everything? Sandman Crossover COMPLETED!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4086213/1/Lost-Hope][Lost Hope]] by Adari (64k words, complete).

#+begin_quote
  The plan was perfect. The execution was even better...but they all forgot to consult the Sorting Hat who had its own views. After all, what can you expect from the hat which contains all four founders?

A bit angsty (and hasn't aged well) is the Grey Maiden series by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1015585/Chris-Widger][Chris Widger]]. The first four books are complete; the last is WIP.

For a bit of a change, a Hermione in Slytherin story: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or][Applied Cultural Anthropology or]] by jacobk (83k words, WIP):

#+begin_quote
  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

** I liked They Shook Hands series by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2560219/Dethryl][Dethryl]]. It's not very dark though.

Also, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/][On the Way to Greatness]] by mira mirth.

**** Given the chapter sizes and the length of time it has been up (19 chapters in 5 years gives us about 4 chapters a year, or one every three months), there's no reason to think it's been abandoned. Late November was only three months ago, so an update will /hopefully/ be forthcoming soon.
