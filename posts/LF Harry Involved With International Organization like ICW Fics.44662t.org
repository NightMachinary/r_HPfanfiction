I remember reading a fic last year (can't remember what it was or completely about) but one of the subplots was about the propaganda in magical Britain. Harry gets help against Voldemort (and Dumbledore in this fic I think) from the ICW who sends American Aurors (I think). Anyway he finds out that while Dumbledore is a very powerful wizard (even the most powerful in Britain) he is not the most powerful in the world and that while still rare, having a Phoenix familiar, is not as rare as people in Britain think as anyone above a certain power level have the ability to bond with a Phoenix though the birds themselves are few in number. He also found out that Britain was also very magically weak compared to the rest of the world because of all the inbreeding and that it was one of the only countries to still subscribe to the blood purity. There were also a bunch of other revelations that I can't remember as well as the now cliched Dark Arts aren't "really" dark, its how you use them speech. Anyway, to actually get to my request. I am looking for fics that follow these kind of ideas where Harry finds out Britain isn't all it's cracked up to be / crazy amounts of propaganda about magic. I'd also like him to get involved with the the ICW or another international organization or some kind of secret organization. I'd also like a pairing but it's not necessary. Just no slash in Harry's relationship please. Don't care about other characters though. So please let me know of any suggestions. Sorry for the long post :$


** The "magical Britain is actually irrelevant" has never been my thing, but the Paradigm of Uncertainty by Lori has a Harry who works for the ICW doing badass stuff and what not.

On second thought, the Firebird Trilogy shares some parallels with what you're looking for.

** The fic you mentioned in your post sounds a lot like linkffn(Harry Potter, Wizarding Savior?)

** Not exactly the same (I don't remember Harry getting into ICW or anything like that), but linkffn(The Brave New World by bellerophon30) is pretty epic.

Harry heads to the US and finds out Britain isn't all that it's cracked up to be. Harry does become a bit of a bad-ass, so it should be somewhat along the lines of what you want.
