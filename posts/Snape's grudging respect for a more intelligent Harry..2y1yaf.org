** Are you opposed to Slytherin Harry? The [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7659033/1/They-Shook-Hands-PostCanon-Revision-Year-One][They Shook Hands]] series features Snape as a mentor of sorts for Harry along with the other Slytherins, starting from Harry answering his questions correctly on the first day of class. The Snape-Harry relationship isn't the focus of that fic or anything, but it does have a profound impact on certain events.

**** Hmmm I see your point. That happens in On the Way to Greatness (the really popular Slytherin Harry fic). Snape hates Harry but won't torment him in public. In They Shook Hands, Snape targets Harry on the first day like he did in canon. If you want to read just that part to see if you'd like it, control-find "celebrity" [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7659033/6/They-Shook-Hands-PostCanon-Revision-Year-One][here]].

** Have you tried The Lionsnake Chronicles by Eria? Also a Slytherin!Harry AU, but Snape is harsh on Harry even though he is a Slytherin. All the other Slytherins begin to notice how Harry tends to stand out from their happy group of cronyism and when he does Snape tries to force him to fit.
