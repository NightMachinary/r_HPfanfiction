*Harry Potter and Marvel Crossover*

Sirius sends Harry to Tony Stark's for the summer and in a freak accident Tony Stark's brain is copied to Harry's.

*Features:*

*~* independent!Harry

*~* smart!Harry

*~* Magic incorporated into technology

*~* Harry/OC ^{(female)} but relation ship doesn't last long

*~* Slight Dumbledore and hermione bashing

*~* Mentions of Slash ^{(no intimate scenes)}

Sadly abandoned but a great fic none the less.
