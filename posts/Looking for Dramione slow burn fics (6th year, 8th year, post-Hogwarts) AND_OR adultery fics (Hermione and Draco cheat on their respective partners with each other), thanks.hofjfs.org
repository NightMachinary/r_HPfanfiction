** Linkffn(The Potioneers by Omnenomnom)

I've got a WIP I just finished the last chapter for. Obviously it'll still take time to edit but at least you know it won't stall out.

Its a world buliding based fic around Hermione's life as a potioneer and the after effects of the war on Draco. The characters are as complex and realistic as the settings are fantastical.

  They need each other unfortunately. Hermione has tricked Draco under her tutelage, arrogant attitude and all. But she would be simple to think he would accept it quietly. They have both have secrets to hide, old wounds better left to fester, and a world full of mermaids, dragons, and magic to explore. (In Character and No Bashing)

** Linkffn( Manacled by SenLinYu)

It's dark for some people but it's so realistic and the most well written story I've ever read and I'm a bookworm!!Keep reading till you reach the flashbacks despite your urge in the earlier chapters. I almost forgot this wasn't canon!! It moved me in a way nothing has ever moved me before!! I liked it better than IsolationðŸ˜Š

  Harry Potter is dead. In the aftermath of the war, in order to strengthen the might of the magical world, Voldemort enacts a repopulation effort. Hermione Granger has an Order secret, lost but hidden in her mind, so she is sent as an enslaved surrogate to the High Reeve until her mind can be cracked. COMPLETE.
