Looking for a good bonding story out there, I've read a few of them wanted to see if there were any other good ones. Ok with pretty much Harry/AnyFemale except Ginny, the longer the better and Mature rating Thanks!


** My favorite bonding story is yule ball panic and its follow ups by philosophize. It's a femHarry/Hermione story. They're stronger than normal but not omnipotent like some of the other stories. It also brings in a few new elements that I haven't seen it other fanfics making it feel different enough to stand out.
