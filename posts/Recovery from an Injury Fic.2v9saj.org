Are there any fics that look into a character getting seriously injured and having to come to terms with how that injury impacted their life? I'm thinking of the classic trope that is often seen in stories like The Legend of Korra. I like it when they stick as much to canon as possible, but I'm open to suggestions :)


** Try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10533247/1/Normalcy][Normalcy]]. It's really long, sticks to canon fairly well at least through the halfway point, is complete, and features a main character having to deal with an injury.

*** I liked that story, but it was a one-shot about Petunia. Are you sure you posted the right link?

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4594634/1/FINDING-HIMSELF][Finding Himself]] fits the bill. It's Cedric-centric - the basic plot is that instead of dying in the graveyard at the end of GoF, Cedric survives, but is cursed with something nasty that makes him essentially a paraplegic. Features good character development and a Cedric/Hermione relationship.

  Absolutely AU! The final battle has been won, but at a great price to Harry. He is grieviously injured. How will he cope with the disabilities now that his duty has been done? MentorSSHP,and ultimately very mild slash. Rated M to be safe.
