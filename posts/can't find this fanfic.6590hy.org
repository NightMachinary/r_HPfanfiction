I only remember a few things from this story and here is what i remember. in this story harry rebels against Dumbledore and decides to fight Voldemort his own way, he also creates potions that work like spells and teach a muggle family that helps him how to use it, if i remember correctly he uses a shotgun that shoots spells. That's all i really remember


** linkffn(Sorcery, UNITed, Independence, Space by Tangerine Alert). Also on his profile is 'UNITed by Sorcery' This is a edit of the story above (and in my opinion a bad edit. For a long time he did not have the original on his profile but he did put it back up. Just a heads-up before you read it. With the re-upload he did not grammar check the story in any way and will not do it anymore.
