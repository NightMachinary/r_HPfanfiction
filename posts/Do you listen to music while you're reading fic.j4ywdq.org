This was something that popped into my head over the weekend when I realised that I always find myself on music in the background while I'm reading. It got me curious what other people listen to - besides the Harry Potter movies soundtracks anyway, that's too easy an answer. :D

And, does the music you listen to change depending on what you're reading?

I've found, weirdly, that the bigger and grander and more action-ey the story, the more mellow the music I listen to while reading it gets. Wastelands of Time always seems to end up being accompanied by Eric Clapton, for some reason.

EDIT - Other question added inspired by CrazyCat and LadyEternal's comments: Do you listen to music while writing?


** I don't. It's too distracting for me. Once I start reading a fanfic, I loose myself to it. Completely immersed and don't even hear whatever my parents tell me at that time. I subconsciously know there is someone speaking to me but I don't hear anything. Just the fic and the words goin round and round creating scenes and emotions.

*** That's really interesting. I get the complete opposite experience - music helps me immerse more into what I'm reading or experiencing. Does that work with other stuff too? Like, do loud movie soundtracks draw you out of the experience?

**** Yes yes they do. Any form of studying (academic or hobby), gaming, thinking (shower thoughts ya know) etc. The overlapping sounds distract me. I'm bad at multi-tasking I guess, cuz if the song plays and I'm reading then either I don't hear the song (if been reading long and completely immersed in it) or I forget what I read and listen to lyrics of song or the rhythm (if I just started reading). But that's OK with me as it allows me to deeply cherish the thing I'm focused at (which is usually fanfiction).

***** That's a good bright side. :)

And a really interesting one too. And I'm going to stop that thought there because I can't find a way to finish it off that doesn't sound like I'm planning to write a study paper on you. Psychologist's habit, I'm afraid - brains are cool!

Does it make a difference what kind of song it is? Like, instrumental or with lyrics, loud or soft, etc?

****** Lol, feel free to use me as a non paid volunteer in your study paper. I already got a few friends in my research circle sending me forms to fill for their data collection (I'm a vlsi research student though). Brains are really cool and we would love to learn more about them ðŸ¤©.

If I'm immersed in my work then the song type doesn't matter at all (I hear it but at the same time I don't know what is being played, or if the song stops in middle then whether it was actually being played). When I'm distracted, I tend to subconsciously focus on the lyrics so it's like I'm just going through the motion of reading and scrolling but the words aren't registering in my mind. If the song stops or my subconscious become conscious, I have to go back to the last part I remember and start reading from there (in fact same thing happens if I read a heartwarming line and I keep thinking about the situation, imagining it subconsciously while reading next part). I guess if it's just music then it's not that distracting but not so sure as I can't experiment on myself ðŸ˜…

** There's this composer on YouTube that I really like, Adrian von Ziegler. He's got a bunch of music and it's just grand to click on a 1 or 3 hour vid of his and be swept away in it. I found his Celtic inspired music especially great to read fanfic on.

However, when I'm writing myself? Absolute chaos. Almost any genre goes and while I much prefer instrumental when I read, writing has no such restriction for me. I also really like creating playlists with songs that remind me of a character I'm writing for.

*** When you say you make playlists for characters you're writing, do you mean it in an inspiration-getting way, or is it more for fun?

**** Both! It's very fun to me to speculate on the character's musical taste, select songs that sort of carry a mood I associate with them, or contain lyrics that I think describe them. When I work on it, it's mostly for fun but it also makes them feel more relatable to me. When I'm stuck writing their perspective or dialogue, it can also be very useful to listen to their playlists to recapture their voice, so to speak.

***** Damn, sounds like you really get a lot out of the process. That's really cool, that it helps you put yourself into their shoes like that. Plotting comes in so many forms, doesn't it? :)

** Oh yes

I'll pretty much listen to anything but I have a couple sad songs I listen to if I need to "get in the mood" to write a sad scene

I really like "Are you happy now" by Meg and Liz

It's about bullying so if you need to get in the mood to write something like that, highly suggest that one.

*** Huh. So there's a slightly emotional-inspirational aspect of it for you? Does it work with stuff other than sad scenes? Do you have a 'get pumped mix' for writing action sequences? :D

**** Ehh sometimes

I like "I'll make a man out of you" from Mulan if I need it for action scenes.

Also.... I just realized this said "reading" and not "writing" ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜­ I'm dumb.

***** Eh. Illiterate, maybe, but not dumb. :D

Besides, it does say it now. That was a really great addition to the question that I hadn't thought about. Which is weird 'cause I totally do the same! More to help with cadence and rhythm than tone or emotion, but still!

Man, that song is such a Get Pumped song. One of the greats in the entire Disney Corpus. :)

*** That... is certainly an evocative simile. I like it. :D

Do you listen to particular things depending on what you're reading, or is it less fic-dependent and more directed by music taste?

**** Well I already have 146 instrumental music, 646 songs and 20 opera music. So I just randomly click on the song and start reading.

But cool. Interesting that it's not story-dependent. Big loud music doesn't draw you out of small quiet scenes or anything like that?
