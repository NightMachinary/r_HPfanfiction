The description on TV Tropes ([[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/RonTheDeathEater/HarryPotter][Bottom of the first section]]) intrigued me - but I don't want to spoil my mood by reading a hatefic, so...

+++

TV Trope description BTW - The Golden Age sells itself as a Deconstruction but is really more of a Hate Fic, as the author admits to finding very few canon characters likable. Harry is a nigh-lunatic Shell-Shocked Veteran with no idea of how to live in a peaceful world. Ron is a sociopathic prankster who repeatedly ruins Hermione's prize possessions and eventually, in a scene set in the epilogue period, ends up leaving her for Oliver Wood's barely legal daughter. Hermione is a mini-Umbridge. The Ministry of Magic is revealed to have an entire office dedicated to cataloguing Wizard rapes of Muggles and then covering them up. Dumbledore is posthumously revealed to have been a Knight Templar who attempted to get Harry killed to destroy Voldemort. And James Sirius inadvertently starts World War III between Wizards and Muggles by playing a horrific prank. By the end, the only sympathetic characters are Snape, the Malfoys, a character named Jane Rochester, and oddly enough, Ginny, who here gets the "pawn of gold-digging Molly" characterization.


** I'd say that description is pretty accurate - the author extrapolates the worst features of the canon characters and the wizarding world. It's quite readable though.

If you want something uplifting then linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4912291/1/The-Best-Revenge]]) by the same author is the opposite; everyone, including Snape, is their best self and Voldemort is defeated by competent and responsible adults.

** I don't think of it as deconstruction or hate. It's a story where the worst qualities of everyone are exacerbated and amplified, but in my opinion it's played for laughs. More of a crack fic than a hate fic, imo.

That being said, if you can't handle reading an AU where the main characters are flawed and their flaws directly ruin their lives then don't read it, but I thought it was a good read. Hilarious at times.
