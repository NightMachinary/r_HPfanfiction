I just started reading the first fic in the series and it's really good, but I noticed that the author hasn't updated the last fic since 2007, but it wasn't marked as complete. Since I don't wanna delve into the comments and risk spoiling the whole story, I though I'd just ask for confirmation here. Also, sorry if this is the wrong flair, I wasn't quite sure which one to use.


** Yes, it's complete. Where are you reading it? It's marked as complete on fanfiction.net: linkffn(3189131)

*** I'm reading it there but for some reason it wasn't showing up as complete for me. Thanks for letting me know. Also, do you know if Harry or Draco dies permanently by the end of the series? MCD/non-happy endings are a trigger for me, and I just saw the author's note at the beginning of the second book that “no one is safe.” I'd like to know in advance if Draco or Harry dies, so I can avoid reading that scene.

**** Neither of them do, but a number of other major characters do throughout the series.
