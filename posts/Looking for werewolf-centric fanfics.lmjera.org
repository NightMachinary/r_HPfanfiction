I'm Looking for a (long) Harry Potter fanfic (Hogwarts years) where a main (or recurring) character is a werewolf. Also preferably an oc (I find new characters fun cuz it's a fresh new journey and you could learn more about these characters the more you read). Seen as the hp fandom is so huge, there must be some great ones?


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24594295][In Bocca Al Lupo]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/morpholomeg/pseuds/morpholomeg][morpholomeg]] is my favorite werewolf fic because it delves deep into what it means to be a werewolf in the wizarding. The main character is not an OC unfortunately, but I hope you enjoy it anyway.
