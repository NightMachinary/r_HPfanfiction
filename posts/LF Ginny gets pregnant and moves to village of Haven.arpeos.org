I'm trying to remember a fic that I read some time ago. Efforts to find it on my own have failed. It's a post-DH fic but ignores 19 Year Later. The fic is Harry/Ginny centric but the pairing doesn't start until later on. Harry and Ginny broke up sometime after the Battle of Hogwarts. Ginny is dating another man who she gets pregnant with. He pressures her to get an abortion and when she goes to have one, she changes her mind at the last moment. The healer gives her a portkey to a village called Haven where she can be safe to have the baby. Harry happens to be living in the village and agrees to sponsor her trying to become a citizen. Unfortunately that means she has to live with him over the course of a year while she is considered for citizenship to the village. If anyone happens to know the fic I'm talking about, I would really appreciate the help.

*** That's it! Thank you so much! It's one of my all-time favorites and it was driving me crazy that I couldn't find it.
