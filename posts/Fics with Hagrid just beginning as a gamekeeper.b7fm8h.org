In canon, Hagrid seems content with his position as gamekeeper, doesn't seem to hold any resentment for being expelled and is grateful that he was allowed to remain on school grounds. I do wonder if that was always the case though. I am curious as to how Hagrid would have adjusted to no longer being a student, especially when he sees all of his other peers advance ahead of him.

Are there any fics that address this? Or maybe just fics that focus on his life as an apprentice gamekeeper?

Thanks in advance!
