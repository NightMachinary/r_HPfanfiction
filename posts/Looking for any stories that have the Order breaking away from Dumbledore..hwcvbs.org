This can be a small group who want to do things another way or the entire group. Other than that I don't have any restrictions.

Any recommendations would be welcome


** Just rereading linkffn(No Thanks by old-crow) (yes, I know, old-crow), but it is fun to look how Order is slowly disintegrating.

**** Almost like a brother of RobSt: heavy on Dumbledore (and quite often Weasley) bashing, super!Harmony stories, where Grangers save everybody, etc. ... all their stories are quite similar to each other.

In linkffn(Thank You Ms Bones by old-crow) he ended blaming Ron for his own death by starvation in the abandoned Death Eaters' prison:

#+begin_quote
  McGonagall persisted, "What about young Mr. Weasley?" She couldn't imagine a worse fate than slow starvation for the young man.

  'Reread chapter one, page one,' thought the old scribe. 'If he'd ever bothered to learn anything from his brothers, rather than his endless obsession with chess, he would have picked the lock the first night that he was there and escaped. Instead he sat there playing with his pieces as he slowly starved to death.' Personally, Crow couldn't envision a more ironic fate for the always-hungry lad.

  Ed had thought, after the whole Promised Day, homunculus, entire country harvested for alchemical batteries thing, the batshit quotient of his life would have settled down some. He really ought to have topped out the meter with that one. But no. The bullshit is just getting started. “Are you fucking kidding me,” Ed demands. “The wizards?” Podfic & Chinese translation available! See notes

** Well in Linkffn(Bound to Him by georgesgurl117) there's a small part of the order(the most important ones) that goes against dumbledore plans after he dies, but is a WIP and that happens only in the last chapters, although the main pairing has been doing lots of stuff behind dumbledore's back.

However, that is not - in any way, shape or form - the main focus of the fic, the pairing is SS/HG(which I know is not for everyone) and it is quite violent. I love it to bits tho.
