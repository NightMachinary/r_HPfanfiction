OP Harry fics where he is not a grey lord potter-black-peverell haremmaster edgelord. linkffn(10610076) is a good example of what i'm looking for.


** linkffn(harry is a dragon, and that's okay)

In which harry is kind, polite and bookish enough to cause your average edgelord indy harry to stroke out if they were to meet.

He is also a near invulnerable dragon so OP is pretty much a given.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** Could I get a TL;DR for what you mean by edgy? I've seen a lot of posts speak about Edgy, and I have no idea as to what the connotation of that term is.

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)

** New Fic- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13752653/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Mirrored-Fates]]

Harry has Tom Riddle in his head due to the Horcrux and will become OP. Tom Riddle can manipulate and possess Harry from time to time, and once Harry takes back his body there will be repercussions.

Harry practically has an OP-Alter ego in this Fic.
