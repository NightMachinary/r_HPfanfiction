** This is a very common topic and it has already been done several times this week alone:

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/50caoa/what_little_things_can_immediately_make_you_stop/][Four hours ago]]

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4zx9t8/pet_peeves_fanfiction/][Two days ago, part I]]

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/500ekb/discussion_what_is_your_shallow_reason_to_not/][Two days ago, part II]]

I do like these questions! It's fun to bitch and moan. Some interesting stuff is said. But, the responses are generally the same. Maybe wait until it's been a week or two before making the same topic that's already on the front page?
