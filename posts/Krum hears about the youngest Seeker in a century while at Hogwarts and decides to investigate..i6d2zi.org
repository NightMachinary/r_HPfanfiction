Krum is waiting for the drawing or it's his downtime between tasks. He hears that Hogwarts has recently had their youngest Seeker in a century. Not only that, but it's the famous Harry Potter himself. Interesting. May as well see how good he really is.

Krum is on another level of course, but he's impressed by how talented Harry is at flying. He gives some pointers and maybe a few lessons. They bond over quidditch. Krum encourages Harry to pursue going pro and puts him in touch with some trainers/scouts/whatever.

I know this doesn't really square with the whole escalating Voldemort situation, but maybe that's solved in the same year by capturing baby Voldemort or something, leaving Harry with this weirdly positive void in his life.

 

Are there any good fics where that sort of thing happens?


** I seem to recall a scene in which Harry realizes through Krum that he is already one of the top Quidditch players in the small magical world. For some reason, they're talking to Draco as well. Unfortunately, I can't place it any more.

** [[/u/te7]] won't thank me for mentioning it, but this largely happens in linkffn(Letters by TheEndless7). Krum wants a proper challenge in an inter-school Quidditch tournament and starts training Harry. It's not the main point of the story though, and doesn't happen until pretty close to the end.

** This would also be interesting in the context of the argument between Ron and Hermione at the yule ball. Would Harry stick up for Krum if he's already bonded with him? How would this change how Harry interacts with Krum and reacts to, say, him getting put under the imperio in the third task?

** I know I threw something vaguely similar in as a background note in one of my fics, but it wasn't anywhere near the focus.
