Dunno if this exists, but it would be nice to read one. Don't care if there's a lot or none smut btw, but I do care that it has to have a plot, even something simple.


** Not to toot my own horn, but I'm currently midway through writing one of these. Check out Harry Potter and the Isiah Strain. Still very early on.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort's death released a virulent disease upon the magical world. Affecting only those under the age of twenty this malady has left Magical Europe reeling over the loss of an entire generation. Harry Potter is the last surviving member of that generation, and suffers under the effects for thirty years. This is Fleur's story of the last two decades of his life. Lemons later on.

**** I hope you'll like it. Got some nice twist. Won't say anything more. You'll see. When you're done tell me what you thought. It's WIP but was updated today so not abandoned. No idea for the bla3x but maybe, it's to say "blablabla" ^{^}

**** Read this awhile ago, but from what I remember she was married to Bill but he died before they had sex so her only children are with Harry. The story is okay, the relationship begins after Harry is an adult, so the age difference issue is avoided. It's a relatively mature relationship between the two, especially for this fandom and this pairing, but the author has some neurosis about female chastity.

[[/spoiler][About halfway through the story it becomes obvious that Fleur also went back in time. The last few chapters are from her perspective and summarizes her experience in the world.]]

***** After reading the prologue, I remembered that I started reading this fic and droped for some reason. IDK if that's a good indicative that i'll enjoy or not, maybe I just got distracted by another story. Dunno.

****** A lot of the early criticisms from some reviewers is that the first few chapters is Harry recounting how he and Fleur become a couple as adults with the time travel story described in the summary happening later. It didn't bother me but if you expected to dive directly into a time travel story instead of a post cannon fic, that could have been it.

  An opportunity comes along that will enable him to make the change and once again reunited with the woman he truly loved. But circumstances have its own plan. A sacrifice would have to be made that will make or break everything he work so hard for. This is the story. Attention:Time Travel. Disclaimer: The usual bla3x..
