Hey everyone! Im looking for fics in which Professor Flitwick takes a more active role in a student's life and education. I don't care who the student is, as long as they are the MC. Maybe the student is getting bullidd or they just decide to ask a dueling champion for advice and Flitwick thus earns their trust. Thanks in advance!

  Ten years of life at the Dursleys have healed Alexandra Potter of any good feelings she might have towards her aunt, uncle and cousin, leaving her friendless and sarcastic about life. On her eleventh birthday, a letter sent by a school of magic may give her a providential escape. Except, of course, things may not be that simple for a girl fan of the Lord of the Rings...

  Harry Potter grows up on Privet Drive, where he is neither loved nor hated; rather, he is treated with indifference. Will his relentless pursuit of knowledge allow him to defeat the Dark Lord? Will he ever be able to live the life he desires?

**** It's a sub-plot, not the concept for the entire story. Still, it takes up a good chunk of 4th year, and I really did enjoy the story and would reccomend it
