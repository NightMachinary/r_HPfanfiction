******* Evidently, judging from the downvote counter. Infact it was so offensive that my other posts in this thread needed down voting as well. I almost feel like I need to check that I didn't murder someone here.

******** I think that rather than offensiveness it's more about the fact that when people found one post of yours to be condescending, it's much easier to assume condescension in other messages from the same person. I have no idea about the timing of the downvotes in comparison with each of your comments, but your last comment in this thread could easily prove that assumption in their eyes no matter whether you meant something of that sort or not really.

******* u/OutOfNiceUsernames:
#+begin_quote
  You are using 'fanfiction' as an insult on a fan fiction sub.
#+end_quote

Many regular users of this sub do that as well. Threads like “the most annoying and widespread clichés”, “the crappiest fanfics you like to read”, “the worst fanfics you've encountered”, etc re-surface about once every 1--2 weeks, if not more often.

So if hedgehog's over 15 downvotes are explained by that, then [[/r/HPfanfiction/]]'s mindhive is demonstrating some hypocritical behaviour.

**** To be fair, though, they do seem to be mocking CC rather than having contempt for fanfics. Because seriously, approved by Madame Rowling it may be, but CC has quite some issues that make treating it as canon a bit problematic and thinking of it as of a fanfic instead means one can concentrate on the actual story without caring about potential plot holes from having this thing sewn onto canon.
