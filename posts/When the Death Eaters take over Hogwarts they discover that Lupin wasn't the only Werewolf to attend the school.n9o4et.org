After all, it would be ridiculous for Dumbledore to risk everything on letting Werewolves attend Hogwarts if he was only going to do it for one random child. Naturally Umbridge immediately pushes through legislation to purge the elements of the student body that are dangerous dark creatures who directly owe their attendance to Albus Dumbledore's legacy, however the Death Eaters never stopped to consider that they still relied on Greyback's werewolves as enforcers, or that more than a few of Voldemort's supporters either were closeted Werewolves or had family that were.

After all, there had to be a fairly strong base of Werewolf Support of Voldemort for James and Sirius to suspect that Remus would defect on those grounds.


** Umbridge wouldn't do shit because she's not a leader. She's just a sadistic enforcer.

On the other hand... if there were more werewolves... just imagine the fun the Carrows would have with detention.

*** Wasn't Umbridge put in charge of the bureaucratic side of the genocide carried out by the Death Eater Ministry?

**** Well, yes and no. She was the face but Yaxley was basically in charge of the Ministry considering he was the one who enslaved Pius.

** Add that the howling shack is supposed to be the most haunted building in the wizarding world, despite only being used for 7 years. Makes more sense that people would call it that if it was actually being used by the new werewolf that dumbledore brings in after the last one left.

** Especially since in Dumbledores mind Lupin proved he could get away with it even with a close call. He would believe he could handle another one and after lupin graduated the shed would be free. Lupin was sent on missions that only he a werewolf could do so why take the chance of losing that information if Lupin dies?

*** Exactly, I just don't see Dumbledore stopping with just Lupin and since he was actually pretty good at keeping Lupin's secret it stands to reason that Harry wouldn't have learned about any other werewolf students unless Snape doxxed them or something.
