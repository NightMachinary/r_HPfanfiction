** Well, I'm no beta reader, and I (personally) dislike most of the stuff you like; but all the same, keep up the good work! I may never read any of your work, but that doesn't mean nobody else would. I wish you the best of luck in finding what you're looking for, and always remember, you are your own master.

Do what you enjoy, for as long as you enjoy it, and don't let anyone else let you otherwise.

** I might be able to do it. I love Harry/Draco and have been wanting to get more into HP fanfiction. But it would mainly depend on exactly how many mistakes you make in your writing. I've done a couple betas (in a different fandom) for people who spoke English as a second language, and in some cases it took literally hours to beta a single chapter because there were usually multiple mistakes in every sentence. I really don't have that kind of time to dedicate to it. If it's the sort of thing where I can beta each chapter in half an hour or less, I could probably do it. I do have a lot of experience being a beta in another fandom.

** Hey, so, I've done a little beta stuff before, though that was mostly grammar related, so I could help you with that to an extent. Mostly, I'd love to help you with ideas! I am also a writer that has a hard time finishing things and I'd love to help you out.

Before that, I'd like to know, realistically, where your English skill is. Do you still make a lot of spelling mistakes, or grammar mistakes? What would you be looking for from me? Shoot me a message and we can talk about this kind of thing.

** I'm into the same stuff and a native english speaker so msg me if you want to talk about it. I've never beta-ed before but I'm down to try it out.
