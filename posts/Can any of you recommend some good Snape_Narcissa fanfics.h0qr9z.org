If you can, could it *not* be an affair? I want them to get together *before* Lucius and Narcissa get married. If there aren't any fics like that, that's fine. Thanks again!


** I don't know of any where they get together before she marries Lucius, but they do get together in the Perfect Slytherins series by [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter/][Jeconais]] (scroll down - a site login may be required), but probably not until the third or fourth year.

** I always thought they'd be a good match, and the way he took the vow for her made me think their relationship had the potential to run much deeper.
