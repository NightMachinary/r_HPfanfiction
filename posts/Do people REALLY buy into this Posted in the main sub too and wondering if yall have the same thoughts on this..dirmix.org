** I think a lot of the problems come from the fact that JKR shoehorned plot to fit with what she thought “should happen” rather than changing her plan to fit the organic evolution of characters and events.

And then she and others go back and try to justify the forced plot.

*** It makes the actions the characters take and the feeling in the book so ...fake and cheap...when she does that. Like the characters are moving like puppets to a preordained future rather than carving it out itself. And that loses a lot of the magic of the series for me, I realized as I got older and started considering parts of canon itself to be OOC.

**** I can't reread the books for the most part anymore. Going back for certain scenes, yes. Rereading the whole thing, no. It's disappointing.

And after PoA, I really couldn't watch the movies either.

Some days it feels like I lost a crucial piece of my childhood. (Other days, I cynically remember I usually like fanfics that fix problems with canon better than the source material for most series and write it off as growing up.)

***** I don't think I can ever re read the books either. It's kind of sad bc I remember 10 year old me bragging to my friends abt how I've read the series ten times over and now, with all the knowledge I have of all the plot holes, all the inconsistencies, all the OOCness, I don't think I can go through without and feel that same magic. Everything feels too convoluted and forced.

I think a part of it also has to do with learning how much of the characters' actions was decided by JKR's own fantasies and strange ideas. Like her self inserting into Hermione and admitting that Ron was based after her allegedly abusive ex husband (?). I just can't take it seriously when the author's personal life or notions starts affecting the organic progression of characters.

****** To be fair, I think a lot of authors initially base characters off of real people they know. The difference is that they don't force the characters to conform to wish-fulfillment endings or stay true to the real life person if that's not how the character reacts on the page.

It's not easy. So many of my own attempts at writing die early on because the characters grow past my ability to world-build the repercussions.

******* Yeah, there's nothing wrong with taking inspiration from real life, EVERYONE does that. But not everyone forces their characters into endings that follow wish fulfillment rather than staying true to their characterization :/

Yeah it is hard, once a characters really gets established, they have a mind of their own lol. That's why when you try to force them to do smth OOC it feels all the more weird to the reader.

**** Kinda reminds me of a fic idea I've had for some time now. Occasionally, in case I ever feel like writing it down, I try to plan out in my head in more detail how it gets to the ending I want from the initial premise. However, whenever I do this, I run into trouble with a certain character not cooperating, because his character traits do not lend themselves to do what I want. The approach I've had so far is a seperate person calling him out on it, which is entirely plausible, and while probably not the obvious action of the person, is easy enough to explain. However, it always felt a bit forced to me, so I've sometimes tried to figure out a way to make it feel more natural.

** I think that Hermione very greatly disliked Ron up to the troll incident, after which she had one of her few character developments in the series: the realization that you don't have to be a good student to be a good person. As far as my recollection of the books goes it wasn't till GoF that the foreshadowing of a relationship between them really started

** I have to say that I understand why JKR put them together because that was what she initially envisioned. She started writing the story and planning out the ending, and she saw them paired together. As the story changed and grew and the characters grew up, her vision for the ending should have changed slightly as well to accommodate the characters that she had now, instead of the ones she originally had in her mind. I've seen this with a few long running series, where a side character changes so much that the writer has to change parts of the story to accommodate them. She may have stopped "listening to her characters" in order to push the overarching story forward. I mean it's all speculation, but in my own writing I've had characters change so much while writing that I've had to completely redo my outline. It's nutso. They really have a life of their own once you start writing them.

Plus, isn't it super rare to marry your school sweetheart and have a successful marriage? I feel like it's doomed just based on that alone. People change so much in those years.

I strongly disagree with this sentiment in the context of 'Harry Potter':

- The wizarding world is very small, and Hogwarts is the ONLY magical school in Britain. Those kids don't have a lot of choices unless they are willing to marry Muggles or foreigners.
- Harry's generation was further bonded by the War. Most named characters in the Books went through hell and back together, and you think they were your AVERAGE Muggle high school teens?
- Not 'EVERYONE' married their high school sweet-hearts. We know that Harry, Ron, Neville, and George did. Luna married someone else called Rolf SCAMANDER. Cho was confirmed by JKR to have married a Muggle of Chinese descent. Draco married someone from the school, but not his 'sweet heart' Pansy. We don't know whom Dean, Seamus, Katie, Susan, Justin, Michael, Parvati, Padma, Anthony, Dennis, Terry, Romilda, Daphne, Pansy, and most others ended up with!
- In case of Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione, they are best friends and war comrades whose relationships are closer than the greatest majority of your average high schoolers could possibly imagine.
- Even in our real world, high school sweet-hearts marrying and staying decades together is also hardly rare. My maternal grandparents did that (they stayed together for 64 years until the death did them apart). My best high school friend did. Even the previous homeowner from whom I bought my current house started dating at age 16 and has been married for 46 years.

**** I don't object to the realistic aspect of their relationship due to the childhood sweetheart aspect alone. It's so much more about how fundamentally different they are as PEOPLE, even AS teenagers and how I can't see them co-existing peacefully or happily for that matter in a marriage. Yes people DO get married to people they've known as kids and if it works out, great for them. I don't think it would work for [[/r/Hr][r/Hr]] though because I don't think they had even found their places in society or what they really wanted for themselves at that point before the epilogue. They were seventeen year olds thrust in war, they had no time to really grow and establish themselves as adults in a functioning society with a normal lifestyle. In that environment, I think they both would grow apart even more as adults. I can see that people that they /will become/ to stay as friends, but as life partners? Unlikely.

**** I never meant to imply that everyone married their high school so's. I never said that. Also, it's just statistics. On just a cursory glance at the numbers it's very rare (like 2% or less) of marriages are between people who knew each other in high school or before. It's a pretty antiquated idea. I know it fits with the universe but still. People grow apart and change. That's just life.

*** Agree 100% with what you said. JKR started out writing a kids book and she planned everything nicely in the end so it would all tie up together with a nice neat knot, but as the books evolved and the characters really fleshed out and acted on their own she should have adjusted her plans accordingly. Instead you had her stubbornly clinging on to her initial concept and having to run around for forced reasons like in the list to justify a relationship which in all honestly, likely wouldn't have lasted a year at hogwarts let alone a marriage for life.
