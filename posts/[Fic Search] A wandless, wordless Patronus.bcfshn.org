That is literally the only specific thing I can remember about the fic in question. For whatever reason, Harry is in a class with some upper-year Slytherins, and they get mouthy when the Patronus charm is mentioned. Harry (who might not go by his name in the fic, I can't remember) gives them a look and produces a wandless, wordless Patronus. I remember that the "gas" emitted from the tips of his fingers and condensed into his Patronus.

Some other things I can kinda remember:

• Harry is either back in time, or in an alternate dimension.

• Harry is nearly an adult.

• Harry isn't in Gryffindor, I think he's in Slytherin.

** I think it is this one. The main character is heather potter a Slytherin (although she is Harry's older sister) and endless magic is actually a big part of the story. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7228006/chapters/16406434]]
