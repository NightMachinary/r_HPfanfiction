** Because in Canon, the old Purebloods appeared to be in power (many Death Eaters avoided prison with some flimsy excuses and they had the gold to bribe others). Canon Harry does not seem to use that kind of power, and if you are writing an OP Harry, he must have ALL THE POWERS. It would be scandalous if Harry wasn't the best at everything. Add to that the fact that most authors do not realize how utterly barbaric stuff like a marriage law would be (for comparison, even the Nazis used tax benefits and a little propaganda to increase birth rates) or that contracted marriages do not end in love most of the time.

Of course, given how everyone bends over and grabs a bottle of lube for Lord Potter Black Gryffindor Habsburg, most authors do not even have a basic understanding of politics. Therefore they make it something beautiful and mysterious, with a long tradition because they fail to understand just how much nepotism, bribery and blackmail would be involved, especially in the systems they are writing.

** Cause it's a culture that leaves an author with a nearly blank slate to work with to do what they please. Almost nothing about it is explained in any sort of detail, so it's their own sandbox to play in.

*** And yet the vast majority of stories feature "19th Century England with a little magic" as "pureblood culture", and only as a superficial coating in most cases.

**** This is something I've been dwelling on recently. There seems to be a recurring theme that Pureblood culture is synonymous with old-fashioned. I'm not buying it.

If I were to imagine pureblood wizards feeling a sense of superiority to muggles it would not be because they were more restrictive and repressed it would be because they are less.

Consider the very real animosity pureblood wizards and witches must feel towards Christianity. Its only very recently that the average Christian stopped freaking out over mere works of fiction much less how they might respond to actual real magic.

Muggleborn's bring their own silent prejudice and in Britain in particular that prejudice is an acceptance of a culture dominated by Christianity for over a thousand years. Take into account the fact that the statue of secrecy is almost certainly a response to Christian hegemony in Europe and suddenly a very different light starts to appear.

Purebloods have a chip on their shoulder, a chip that isn't even disagreeable considering its probable sources. Attitudes towards dark magic are almost certainly formed as a defensive response to the rather violent attitudes of earlier Catholicism/Anglicanism. A certain amount of pride in snubbing their noses at the prudishness and squeamishness of muggles with their silly religions and restrictions on behavior isn't a huge leap for me.

I would imagine attitudes about sex are lax, and the perceived prejudice against muggleborns is almost certainly due to muggleborns actually NOT getting it. Largely because I imagine that the kind of muggleborns that aren't simply obliviated come from open minded homes in general and so don't see a problem with the muggle world because eleven year olds simply haven't experienced it.

Harry Potter enters in a time that from our perspective these things are no longer true about the muggle world. So pureblood animosity doesn't make sense, it seems like simply prejudice. Albus Dumbldore though was born in the freaking late 1800's! He personally experienced muggle prejudice, Grindlewald's attitude and Dumbledore's as well are natural if horrible responses to their experiences.

From a pureblood's perspective, muggle culture is Christian culture. Its not a wonder why they would find such a thing offensive and worthy of scorn. The idea that muggle culture simply moved on in the last fifty years hasn't really had a chance to percolate into the general consciousness of pureblood wizarding culture.

***** I disagree with the focus on religion. The Statue of secrecy came into effect in 1692. Christianity ruled Europe for a thousand years before that - even the last pagan holdouts were gone centuries before that. Hogwarts was founded at a time when England had been Christian for half a century. No, the SoS was not a response to Christians.

However, I agree that wizards wouldn't like the faith. For my stories, I often assume that after the SoS, they "went back to our pagan roots" - or what, after over a thousand years of Christianity, was left. And in my AU story "Patron", the wizards are far more progressive in matters concerning sex, and consider muggles to be prudes. They also use far more magic than in canon - it's their way of life, after all - and yet they are more archaic in other ways (although tempered by customs - a law made in the 1500s might still be in effect, but it's not going to be enforced any more, for example, because society has moved on.)

****** That makes a lot of sense. A lot of my ideas on the subject are pretty half-cocked, but I find the idea that Pureblood prejudice being baseless probably doesn't do the topic the justice it deserves.

Pureblood culture is probably less pagan and more absent of religious tones in general based off what we actually see in the story. Pureblood Wizards seem quite partial to the idea that they are the higher power and everything else is below them. Which from a certain point of view is even true.

Lineage seems to matter a great deal which since magic seems to follow families probably has a pretty deep meaning to the culture. Power and magical power in particular is highly regarded. There seems to be a tone of reverence to the sheer power Voldemort wielded even in the case of the wizards who opposed him. In much the same way that Lucius seems to regard Dumbledore with a great deal of respect even though he clearly hates everything the man stands for. The general attitude of the masses seems to give wizards and witches who wield magic powerfully a great deal of leeway in both behavior and allowances.

Power > Lineage > Wealth > Position seems to be the sense I get from the books about what wizards respect. Power seems to largely be about knowledge and so it ties almost directly into lineage since wizards seem to be quite enamored with secrets, holding them for the sheer sake of knowing something someone else doesn't.

I'm not sure if I could draw any conclusions from this, but this is what it generally seems like to me.

******* Well, anti-muggle prejudice is as baseless as anti-semitism. Dragging up old or ancient history to make a case doesn't give a reason either.

With regards to religion, I think JKR simply molded wizards after England - most of Europe doesn't give a damn about religion any more, after all.

******** Hrm... wasn't intending to imply it wasn't baseless. Its baseless, but not meaningless or from nowhere.

The story is also largely occurring in the nineties, which the cogs of non-religion hadn't quite finished turning as much then as they have now.

** For me, it's because in canon, we have this whole new special super awesome magical world... but they celebrate Christmas and go to school on a train.

** i generally assume that they like to live vicariously since the characters in these fics are so far from their original characterization they are basically self-inserts. it's a more elaborate way of playing dress-up and pretending to be fairy princesses. (not that theres anything wrong with that but those fics arent my cup of tea)
