:END:
The only thing I can remember from the Fic is that Harry decided to kill the dragon in the first task with an RPG. Might have been a time travel Fic, might not, but I do think that someone questioned Harry due to the fact that the dragon was really expensive and he gave some snarky response.

  Harry gets picked for the Triwizard Tournament. He does not like this. Mayhem, destruction, and HHR. OOC Harry. M for violence and frequent profanity.

*** Well, Harry Potter is set in the 1990s and at least in the USA, the common perception is that basically 100% of the former Red Army's equipment was for sale in the mid-90s after the Soviet Union broke up... and that's after 7 decades of mass-producing weapons and shipping them (or their designs) around the globe for proletariats to throw off their oppressors.

I mean, if there'd been a Union of Soviet Socialist Sorcerous Republics, it would have been shipping the goblins and house elves wands in the 50s to overthrow the Ministry and providing training in magical combat to muggleborns assassinating rich purebloods in the 1960s and 70s.

***** The collection of short stories called [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1087368]["There's nothing to fear"]] have as premise an AU in which Voldemort was sorted into Gryffindor. He is still, well, Voldemort but instead of a pureblood supremacist, he is an equalitarian who claims to be fighting for the rights of muggleborns, hags, goblins, house elves, etc.

*** I kinda remember this too... And it was because Lupin was working for the Russian mob, I think.
