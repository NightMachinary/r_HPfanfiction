Ends up in the past (somehow) after the war has ended. She knows who will die/how (for the most part). But not anything huge like the Horcruxes. What would someone like Rita do/how would she act?

She's an illegal Animagus, she's a reporter. She'd be able to follow Harry Potter around, Albus Dumbledore, etc. Without anyone being the wiser.
