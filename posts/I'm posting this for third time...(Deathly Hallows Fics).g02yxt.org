I was searching for a fanfic that starts after the part of deathly hallows part 1 in which Harry leaves the Burrow without telling anyone because he felt guilty for Moody's death and George being injured.. In the movie Ron stops him, but I want a fanfic in which Harry leaves Burrow and no one comes out to stop him..... The fic could have any Harry pairing. Any suggestions..?? I'm posting this for the third time... previously I got no reply no recommendations...so please any fics related to my request..?


** I remember reading a fic like that and will try to find it, but I remember it being awful and had an OP Harry.
