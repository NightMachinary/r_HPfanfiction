And promptly faint as you realize that Umbridge is sleeping next to you. Naked.


** Instant retirement and a purposely botched self-obliviation.

** Ok, first of all: panic and run around the room like a headless chicken while screaming incoherently for some hours, this should guarantee that no one doubts I'm Fudge. Second of all, take every bribe that comes remotely close to me -which has the added benefit of ensuring my cover stays uncontested- and use to invest in a extremely secure mansion with lots of wards (preferably one of which is an aversion ward that uses the sacrifice of Umbridge's life, this will ensure that nothing with an once of self-love even thinks about coming near). Now that the important stuff is out of the way I can start on the trivial things, like declaring myself god-emperor of Britain, investing heavily on the DoM to find a way of making me appear a little less like a ten-years old corpse of a malformed rat, sending all the DMLE in a mission to steal a country's entire supply of chocolate for me, declare war with some nation over some ridiculous motive, like having a leader that refuses to call me Your Magnificent Godly Ministery while licking my balls in public with reporters around... oh, yeah, if I have some time maybe also tell someone about Voldemort being alive... maybe... who knows?... Eh, they managed well enough in the books, no reason to change it.
