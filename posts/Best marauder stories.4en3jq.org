Haven't read stories from the marauder era before, so what's your favorite marauder stories? Over 60k wording and good writing. And no slash please


** linkffn(Tears on the Blacony) Probably the most definitive romance marauder era series. Lots and lots of drama. More than you can shake a stick at really.

linkffn(Against the Moon) A story that spans the entire time the marauders are at Hogwarts.

There isn't a whole lot of marauder stuff that isn't slash, wolfstar (Remus/Sirius) is a very popular pairing so it's very common to see it.

  The odds were stacked against him: a child from a blended home with no friends, no social skills to speak of, and a terrible secret. Yet slowly Remus Lupin began to realize there was a place for him in the world, if he could find the courage to claim it.

** linkffn(The Life and Times by Jewels5) is one of the best regarded marauder era fics.

linkffn(Dark Marauder by BajaB) is a one shot shorter than 60k, but its very good, so I'm reccing it anyways in case you'd like to read it.

  The Maruaders were not nice people, but what if the gang was as Dark as they should at first glance appear to be? AU Marauders era one-shot.

  She was dramatic. He was dynamic. She was precise. He was impulsive. He was James, and she was Lily, and one day they shared a kiss, but before that they shared many arguments, for he was cocky, and she was sweet, and matters of the heart require time.

** [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/7287445/1][All these Complications]]: An AU where Regulus lets Sirius know about the existence of horcruxes. One of my favorite fics ever.

linkffn(If I Die Young by Annie Lockwood) is one of my favorite romances. Fast paced (a lot of marauder era stories are overly bloated) and really good writing. WiP.

Also, linkffn(Fool Me Twice by DawnieS). James/Lily AU, lots of courtroom drama.

  Lily Evans is pretty, intelligent, vivacious... and accused of murder. James Potter is privileged, arrogant, and conceited... and her best chance at avoiding Azkaban. If only he wasn't convinced of her guilt.

  She was a planner, precise, dedicated. He was impulsive, spontaneous, rash. She was dramatic, he was charismatic. She had a horrible temper, he loved to push her buttons. Two very different people from very different worlds, but somehow they fit together so perfectly it was almost as if they'd been created for each other. But love doesn't always map out the way you plan it to.
