The basic plot is that Harry was more rebellious at Number 4 than seen in cannon, but everytime he acted up, usually with magic, Dumbledore came over to memory charm him and the Dursleys. This constant memory modification ends up locking that part of his personality up, along with a lot of his magical talent.

The story really starts sometime around book 2~3, with either Lockhart's Obliviate or the Dementors breaking the magical block in his mind and giving him back his spine. Or maybe it switches which part of him is stuck behind a memory charm.

I much prefer to read rather than write, and I don't really know where the story would go from there. This is an open plot bunny up for grabs by anybody. All I ask is a link once the first chapter goes up.


** In linkffn(The Well Groomed Mind) Dumbledore has manipulated Harry's mind and memories. He breaks through it in Book 4.

*** Write it in ff.net's copy & paste section, it is supposed to be copy paste but you can just type in that... it's what I do for my stories.

You could also just write it, publish it, then go to the edit part in ff.net, edit the document, then highlight everything and reset formatting.
