I'm looking for fics where Harry gets transported to another dimension where his parents or at least one of them are alive. Other than that I really don't have any preference. I just read a one shot where he tried to kill himself after the war ended and was put in a universe where he died that Halloween night and Neville was the BWL and it was really good. I also read a story while back where he fell into some portal during the raid on the Department of Mysteries and was put in a world where his parents were alive and he had a doppelganger and two younger siblings and it was wild just the amount of differences they had in that world where Ron and Hermione weren't really his friends and a bunch of other stuff. But that story only had him in that dimension for one chapter or so then he went back and fought his own Voldemort. Anyways thanks for any recommendations!


** *To Call A Place Home* is my personal favourite. James and Lily live, Harry in that world died as a baby and he has 3 younger siblings. The war is raging there.

Otherwise there was this [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/m5o1gb/can_anyone_recommend_me_the_cliche_harry_gets/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share][thread]]. If you feel up to it you could check out if they are alive in any of these.

  Harry won the war. It's months afterwards and unexpectedly, he's literally picked up off the face of the world and shoved into another. One where Harry Potter died a long time ago. Where the Potter family's still fighting a war against a Dark Lord that's ruling the world one muggle murder at a time. They say he's their only hope. Harry doesn't really want in.

** You're gonna love linkffn(8236351) ! It's actually a prequel to another fic but can be read on its own. IIRC, Harry regularily and randomly gets pulled put of dimensions and into others; against his will. Fantastic writing!

  Part of the Wanderer!verse. Prequel to Wanderer. The fifteenth jump lands him in a place so much like the home he has always wanted that he just can't stay away, even though he knows it'll hurt all the more in the end.
