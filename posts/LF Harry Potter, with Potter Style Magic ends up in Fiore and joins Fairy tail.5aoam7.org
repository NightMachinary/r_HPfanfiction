I just thought about this, and wondered why it isn't more popular. Harry especially a post Canon Harry in Fiore would be fun. Hell id their was ever a time for Harry to use Wandless Magic, it's be on Fiore fighting for Fairy Tail.


** I think it'd be tough to combine HP and Fairy Tail magic. Fairy Tail has spells capable of devastating whole landscapes, while in the HP universe, the most you can do is..I don't know..Fiendfyre? You could invent spells like that, but it wouldn't really fit with HP in my opinion.

*** Wholly in agreement.

HP combat spells are more focused on effect, while FT magic is based upon sheer destruction.

**** Which in itself could be Harry's thing in Fiore. HP magicals are extremely versatile while mages in FT are limited but extraordinarily powerful in a small spectrum of spells and abilities.

If Harry uses the full palette he could take on any FT mage with creative use of HP magic. At least I could think of a few interesting fights.

** Make it FT comes to HP universe and completely annihilate things then yes.

*** Just to mess with the FT crowd that such a crossover would draw I'd include Natsu running against Voldemort because he wants to punch him into oblivion, the Dark Lord shooting an Avada Kedavra at him and the Dragonslayer just dropping dead. No Shonen bullshit ressurection or loud screaming to overcome impossible odds, just 100% dead Natsu Dragneel.
