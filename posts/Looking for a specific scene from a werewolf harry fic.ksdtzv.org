** The only werewolf!Harry fic I've read is one where due to a reaction between the horcrux and the lycanthropy resulted in Harry getting a werewolf animagus form

** Could be wrong, but this sounds like linkffn(9527368). I distinctly remember a scene from that story that was like this.

Edit: Since FanfictionBot is refusing my call, [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9527368/1/The-Beast-Within][here you go]]!
