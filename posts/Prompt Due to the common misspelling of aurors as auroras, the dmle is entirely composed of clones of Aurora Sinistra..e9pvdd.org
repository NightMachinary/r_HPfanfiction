*** Auror Sinistra, oh can't you see?\\
You can cast Incarcerous pointed at me!\\
Oh Sinistra, if lovin' you's a crime,\\
then send me to Azkaban to do my time.\\
Her cloak-covered beauty, fills me with glee,\\
She's got my heart in cuu~stody,\\
But before that witch names me her prey,\\
I'm hat over heels!\\
(He's hat over heels!)\\
I'm hat over heels for Madam Pomfrey!~â™ª

***** Why, thank you. If it's not obvious, it's to the tune of '[[https://youtu.be/wNQeBdrFbek?t=32][Two Perfect Girls]]'. The one where Brock sings about Officer Jenny and Nurse Joy.
