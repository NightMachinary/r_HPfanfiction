** No, because Dementors are classified as spirits not beasts/animals. It would be like having a ghost or peeves for a patronus.

Per Pottermore:

** Why not? Patronus is not about the creature/animal itself, but the personal associations the caster has with it.

Maybe someone's Patronus symbolizes, say, their missing older brother, and a dementor plushy is all they have from him. Or that brother used to dress up as a dementor when they played as kids. So now they have this positive association that manifests as a Dementor Patronus, even though it has nothing to do with actual Dementors as a species.

*** The patronus would mirror what the other's patronus is/was. We saw this in HBP when Tonks' patronus changed to a wolf - the same as Remus' (a regular wolf, not a werewolf, as explained by JKR, though Remus didn't like anyone seeing his) and in DH when Severus' patronus was seen to be a doe, the same as Lily's.

***** No it isn't. It's canon that he was in love with Lily, and that that's why his patronus echoed hers.

The only clue about his feelings toward James being anything other than hatred is that he hated him for having the things he himself didn't have - a loving family, skills in the classroom and on a broom, charisma, and eventually the woman he loved. Severus hated James for being everything he couldn't be himself. He didn't want to be his mate - he wanted to be him.

****** I think you're reading a bit too much into my comment. You see, it's a joke, because his patronus is the female version of James's animagus form. It was intended to represent Lily, and his +creepy obsession+ "love" for her, but if you skew the perspective a bit you can see it as him representing himself as the female counterpart to James, meaning his hatred was actually to cover up the fact that he was a total bottom for James.

Patronus is a representation of your loved one/protector. Harry's is a stag because his father's animagus form was a stag. We don't know James's patronus either, but it was most likely something different.

If it reflects a person - which it doesn't have to - it reflects in animal form who they are, which is to say it reflects their patronus and animagus forms (JKR has said that a person's patronus is almost always the same as their animagus form).

It is, in fact, a wolf -- an ordinary wolf, not a werewolf.

Everything wolfish disgusts him, and he often produces a non-corporeal Patronus deliberately, especially when others are watching./

  /No reliable system for predicting the form of an individual's Patronus has ever been found, although the great eighteenth-century researcher of Charms, Professor Catullus Spangle, set forth certain principles that are widely accepted as true./

****** I don't keep up with every article on Pottermore and google is not a proof of anything. Lily, James and Remus's patronuses are not in the books. And where does Dumbledore say anything about Lily's patronus in DH?

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Animagus form is an expression of who you are. Patronus is an expression of other people. Harry is nothing like a stag, Snape is nothing like a doe. Maybe Tonks has something in common with a wolf, but it's not why she has such a patronus.

I give you Lily, because it's plausible that Dumbledore recognises her Patronus (though it's debatable that Snape even knew it when he learned to cast the spell), but Tonks's patronus is a wolf because it represents Remus himself, not his patronus. And it doesn't make sense for James to have a stag patronus. He's arrogant, but not so arrogant to have himself as the person he loves most/his protector.

There is JKR stating your Patronus can change to an eteral love, so he is partially correct as it can become a representation of your loved one. He could also be correct in Harry's Patronus taking the form of his father, as Harry is shown to still love his parents dearly even in the epilogue.

Also your Patronus and Animagus form can be the same, but it's not always the case.

#+begin_quote
  *Your Animagus and Patronus animal can be the same*\\
  If a wizard never masters Animagus magic, it doesn't necessarily mean they'll never find out the animal they could've been. Another pretty complex form of magic, the [[https://www.pottermore.com/explore-the-story/expecto-patronum][Patronus Charm]], has been known to mirror it, meaning the animal you cast to attack [[https://www.pottermore.com/explore-the-story/dementors][Dementors]] could well be your inner animal too.

Because a Dementor is not an animal. And a patronus takes the form of an animal (whether magical or not). The original poster used the word "creature" instead but regardless, a dementor is neither.

**** Dementors /are/ technically magical creatures. So are wizards (much like humans /are/ animals).

There are 3 (I think) creature classifications: being, beast, and spirit(non-being). The only one that can be a patronus are beasts. That's get a little murky when you look at centaurs and merpeople, though.

I also just realized that's why it's called Fantastic /Beasts/. Heh.
