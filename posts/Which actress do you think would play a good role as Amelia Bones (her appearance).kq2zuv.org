I'm reading a very good fanfic, where Amelia adopts Harry, and I have a little trouble imagining her.

That's the fanfic I'm reading: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12104688/36/Whispers-in-the-Night][Whispers-in-the-Night]]

/+Yeah, I know, silly little problem hahaha.+/


** I thought [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Sian_Thomas][Sian Thomas]] who [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Amelia_Bones][played her in the films]] was pretty good.

** Before seeing the movie, I always had the image of Bones (Emily Deschanel) when thinking of Amelia Bones. I think probably because of her last name at first, but also because she's described to be trustworthy, smart, capable and very professional.
