I swear I read a story ages ago where Tom raised Harry as his son. I believe Harry knew who his birth parents were and I think he had a younger sibling. Despite it being Voldemort I think him and Harry had a descent relationship and Harry respected him. Can't remember much else. If you don't know it but now a differ Tom raising Harry story please rec it. Thanks

** There is In Death, Stand By linkffn(8507725) - it's brilliant but unfinished. Also, As Portioned From A Whole linkffn(10023558), which has been going for a long time, and is updated somewhat more recently.

Both are nominally Harry/Voldemort. The first one hasn't progressed far enough to go into that direction yet; the second I haven't read in a long time so I can't say how much slash there is, if any. I remember that it has a really great writing style, though, and all the author's other stories that I've read have been great, too.

  After the infamous massacre of the Potters, young Harry Potter went missing. It doesn't really help that years later he turns up again, a bit darker, stranger and more erratic than anyone had hoped for. But Harry hardly cares, in the end it's his decision on which side he will fight; dark, light or no side at all. Eventually HP/LV... of sorts.
