  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13217021/1/Tales-From-Durmstrang-Poisoned-Bloodlines]]

" In the modern-day wizarding world, two half-blood wizards attended Durmstrang with hopes of bringing change and justice to all students regardless of blood status. They seemed inseparable until tragedy struck, leading to them departing ways. While one withdrew to the shadows, the other boy continued the rebellion against the pure-blood hierarchy to kill it once and for all. "

A fic I'm writing about Durmstrang that describes the school in the detail.

******* Hi! I read through the first 40-50%, so here are my impressions so far.

First, the writing is definitely coherent and understandable. The story is also not boring as a brick, which is a definite plus - there was a real pull to read on, so it didn't feel like a slog through.

There were a few grammar mistakes - some switching between past and present tenses in the narrative - which is a mistake you should check for carefuly as you write.

Additionally, dialogue is often hard to get right, and while you managed to get it to sound natural about half of the time, it felt a bit stilted in the beginning.

Now, some people would advise you to not include a "wall of exposition" in the narrative. (Specifically, the explanation of the divisions, for example.) However, that doesn't mean you can't include so much exposition! It just means that you need to come up with a way for it to sound natural, as opposed to being a information dump. There are many ways to do this, and many people much better than me at writing have explained them.

So, to conclude based on what I have read so far. The good parts are that the story is good and the writing is coherent. The problems are some grammar issues and some parts that don't feel natural.

Keep writing, and you'll keep getting better. I'll finish reading the story (at least till the latest chapter - or is it complete?) and give you some more plot-related final impressions.

********* Hey! Sorry for the late reply. (Six days, that's terrible even for me.)

Anyhow, I thought the characters were pretty good - the backstories were nice, the characters weren't one-dimensional, etc. Most importantly, they /felt interesting/. That can be really hard to get right, and one of the biggest obstacles to writing good character.

A large part of writing a character is writing how they speak and think, and of course I said a bit about the dialogue in my earlier comment.

No promises about when, but I'll give you more impressions about the general story once I'm caught up. Again, sorry for the long wait!
