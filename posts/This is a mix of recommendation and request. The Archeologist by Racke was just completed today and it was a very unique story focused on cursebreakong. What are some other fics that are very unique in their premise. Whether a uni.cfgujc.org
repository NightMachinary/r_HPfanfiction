  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.

** There's Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider and it's sequel, Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis.

The first features Petunia a cursebreaking Squib who works for Gringotts and isn't afraid to apply ample muggle firepower to resolve conflicts.

The sequel centers around Harry, Ron and Hermione, with them having their own adventures. I must confess though, I never finished reading the sequel.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

  AU. Having been raised by his tomb raiding aunt, Harry Potter had known early on that he'd follow in her footsteps and become a Curse-Breaker, discovering and exploring old tombs full of lost knowledge and treasure. But he and his two best friends might have underestimated just how dangerous the wrong sort of knowledge and treasure could be. Sequel to "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider".

** I'll second The Archeologist. The author has an interesting narrative style, it's probably not for everyone, but I really enjoyed the fic.
