I know Independent Harry and W/D bashing go hand in hand but are there any stories where it's either non existent or minimal, or at worse starts out bashing but they come to terms and they end up helping out? Could be time travel/Peggy Sue, an AU, fixit fic, or whatever.


** One of my personal favorite Badass/Indy!Harry stories is linkffn(A Second Chance at Life by Miranda Flairgold). It's got some really in-depth takes at new magic, new species, and the like. It has a bit of time travel, bit of Super Harry (ok, a fair bit of Super!Harry later on), and the like. But he's by no means the most bad-ass person in the story, so that's fun.

It starts out with the whole "find a new school" trope and the classic "why didn't anyone else slow time with the Room of Requirements" gag. But it quickly diverges and becomes a very good (in my opinion) and very distinct story.

Sadly the story is first of a trilogy, and the final story was never finished, and the author doesn't seem to have been active for like 6 or 7 years. But the two parts that are available are *definitely* worth reading.

  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.

** Whee, I love getting to recommend linkffn(Emperor by Marquis Black). I wouldn't quite call Harry "super" in this fic, but he's definitely badass, not just in battle, but also in tactics and strategy. Much of the canon cast is only loosely featured, and while there are a few portrayals that makes me raise my eyebrows, I would not call it bashing.

*** I'd read it but it hasn't been updated since January and I hate reading incomplete fics. But thanks for the suggestion.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

** So, I'll leave this here. It's not 100% what you're looking for but it's pretty close, and I really like it. Linkffn(harry potter and the Prince of slytherin) is a fic where the author takes all the WBWL (it is a WBWL fic. Or is it?!) tropes and tries to make them make sense. The author usually updates weekly but has taken the summer off to plan book 3. Harry is bright, and I think on the path to Greatness, whatever that means for this fic.

  Harry Potter was sent away to the Dursleys by his parents who were raising Jim Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Think you know this story? You have no idea. AU, Slytherin!Harry, WBWL. Currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Hopefully no bashing.
