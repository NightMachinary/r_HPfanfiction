I'm really into SI's and OC's, but I'm decently new to ff.net and am trying to navigate a world without wattpad (been there for 8 years and just started looking around to other places). I know this is a hard ask, but is there anything like What's her name in Hufflepuff or To the Next that i can binge out during this stay-at-home time? While i don't enjoy ao3, i just finished the Changeling and it's post-war series if that helps. Cleansing my pallete of Mary-sues is difficult during this time.

  I wasn't the Lavender that could have been ... I was no Gryffindor.(A realistic attempt at an SI fic, with absolutely zero Mary-Sue-ishness).
