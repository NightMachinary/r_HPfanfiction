Im looking for fics where Tom slowly discovers magic while in the orphanage and begins to torture the people who bully him.


** I don't know if Tom Riddle was ever bullied. I think he was the bully.

** If you'll forgive me for making a poor joke and wasting your time, then the answer to your question is canon.

Book 6 to be precise.

Because Book 6 is like a fic.

The better version of "Cursed Child" if you will.
