:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
There's a completed +7-year+ fic where, as a side plot, Draco Malfoy gets his hand on a copy of the communist manifesto and begins questioning his role as a follower of Voldemort. The fic is not one of the parodies like "Harry Potter Becomes a Communist"

EDIT: [[/u/raseyasriem][u/raseyasriem]] found it. It's actually a series: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214][The secret language of plants]]

** Linkao3(The Meaning of Geranium) could be it? However, it's like third in the series so start with linkao3(The Meaning of Mistletoe).

*** That's it exactly! Thank you so much for finding it. I think I was confusing it with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8034380/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Garden-of-Intrigue][Harry Potter and the Garden of Intrigue]], which is a seven-year story. Also good, but quite different.

  In which Harry understands Victorian flower language at age 11. Events grow gradually further and further from the original. Features CharacterDevelopment!Crabbe and Goyle, and many other not-quite-expected variations. This story has reached its conclusion; enjoy. Watch out for the April Fools' chapter.

  With adulthood comes the realization that parents can't fix all. That there are dangers that are too big.This is the story of a war and the people who didn't want to fight in it but did anyway.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

** I love fics with weird side plots like this for characters. My personal favorite is in Hermione Granger and the Child Protection Movement when Draco visits the aerospace museum and it becomes his deepest ambition to join the Royal Air Force so he can fly a jet.
