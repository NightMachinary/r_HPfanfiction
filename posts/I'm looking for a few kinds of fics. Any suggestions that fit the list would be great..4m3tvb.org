1.  Fics where Hermione goes off the deep end. Like maybe her knowlege obsession goes to far ends up summoning Cthulu or some kind of lovecraftian abomination.

2.  Fics where the high level spells getting tossed around are more than just stunners and killing curses. Something like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2896398/1/Only-Enemies][Only Enemies]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time.]]

3.  Fics where Harry leaves Magical Britain permanently or for an extended period of time.

4.  *GOOD* manipulative Dumbledore fics. I recently read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][The Well Groomed Mind,]] [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11613187/1/What-Was-Your-Plan][What was Your Plan]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6254783/1/Rise-of-the-Wizards][Rise of the Wizards]] and I really like the concept of Dumbledore being a shadowy puppeteer when it's done well.

5.  Some shitty wrong boy who lived fics. I really enjoy these.

6.  Voldemort is actually Dumbledore with a time turner.

7.  Fics where the blood prejudice is as bad as [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6655313/1/Something-Like-Your-Family][Something Like Your Family.]] While I really enjoyed the ideas and world that fic set up, I didn't particularly enjoy the story that the author wrote.

8.  fics where Harry can see the dead. Not just ghosts and stuff, but more dead people that others can't see. Preferably something like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3883902/1/The-Ghost-and-the-Darkness][The Ghost and the Darkness]] but from the Potter fandom instead of the Naruto one.

9.  I want to see more Lovecraftian stuff in general. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9172846/1/Deathly-Hallowed][Deathly Hallowed]] is a great fic but I'm looking for others.

10. fics like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8724634/1/The-Snow-Queen][The Snow Queen]] where Harry gets raised somewhere completely different and ends up getting summoned back to Hogwarts for the Tournament.

11. fics where Harry is completely apathetic.

12. A Fic where about exploring lost (preferably magical) civilisations. Something like the Atlantis bits in Wastelands of Time would be fantastic.

--------------

I'll probably toss some more things on this list as I think of them.


** 3) *Emperor*, linkffn(5904185): Harry has never been in wizarding Britain.

4) *The Dark Lord Never Died*, linkffn(11773877): That Dumbledore was one mean manipulator.

5) *Gabriel*, linkffn(11790110)

7) *Divided and Entwined*, linkffn(11910994): Hermione was the leader of the Muggleborn resistance. A very brutal, grim, and realistic fic.

10) *Wand, Knife and Silence*, linkffn(9729235): Harry raised by Blaise Zabini's mother, and got called back to Hogwarts for the Tournament.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - and Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

Gabriel is alright, pretty good considering it's genre though. Haven't started the others though so I can't comment on them yet.

** 3, possibly 11 in a way: linkffn(Desperate Measures by vvc). Not only does Harry leave Britain, it is then almost annihilated. It's pretty well-written, and an original take on the Veela trope. Give the prologue a try - as incentive, I'll mention that Draco gets half-eviscerated (no, really, I promise). In the prologue. The fic also features a great Pansy, which I have seen very seldom.
