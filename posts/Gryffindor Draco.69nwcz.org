Is there a Fic where the events on the first train ride are the same, but Draco gets sorted into Gryffindor?


** The Innocent series features a really nice Gryffindor Draco! It's very long, 3 parts complete and one WIP currently updating. :)

*** Ooh, a story I've never heard of before.

Can you give a bit more detailed description on it?

Particular points of interest for me: its evaluation on [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStationsOfTheCanon][canon stations,]] [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall][idiot balls,]] drama balls, wishful thinking, magical lore exploration, deconstruction, and duels.

**** This series has Sirius raising Harry and Draco going to Gryffindor, and yet Year 1 and 2 were complete canon rehashes.

Thanks for the heads up. What about the later years? How much do /those/ diverge?

****** It's only midway through year 3, right now. Updates once or twice a month. It's a good story, don't get hung up on the canon rehashing. There are differences.

**** Basics the premise is that Sirius escapes from Azkaban when Harry is 8 and raises him in secret. The news gets out. Lucius wonders if Harry is being raised to be a new dark lord. Draco has an almost-twin, Hydrus- who plays out a typical canon malfoy (but meaner) and so Lucius basically raises Draco to be a Griffyndor so they'll be on Potters side either way. Sounds hokey when I write it out but it doesn't read that way. So Draco is from the start much more of a nice kid, but he still struggles with his identity and his relationships with his family, Gryffindor friends and old Slytherin friends. He isn't the main character necessarily but a prominent one and it's a fantastic series. Mostly canon compliant in the important bits.

*** Its really good and Draco stays in character and the reason why he ends up in Gryfindor is quite good

** Linkffn(Time to Spare)

I love this fic so much. It's Harry and Draco go back to the 70s and fight the war. Draco is in Gryffindor for his new persona. It's amazingly good and i might actually reread it now that I'm thinking about it.

  HBPcompliant rewrite of Time For Me. Voldemort has a sinister plot to catch Harry out of bounds and cast a spell to send him back two hundred years, but all does not go as planned and Harry isn't as gone as he'd thought...

** Earthbound Spook is what started my love for Gryffindor!Draco. It's probably my absolute favourite fanfic, ever. I'm not normally a fan of dimension travel, but this one isn't bad in that respect.

The Draco in the fic comes from an alternate universe where he had been sorted into Gryffindor. DH-non compliant.
