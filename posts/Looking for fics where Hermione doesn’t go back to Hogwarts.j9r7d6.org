Hello! I'm looking for fics where Hermione becomes jaded about the schooling system and realizes after the war that there are more important things in life than achieving high grades in school. Not OOC Hermione, she still would love learning, but she simply chooses to pursue her own idea of what that entails. Thanks so much.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/][Blindness]]: Without Harry being present, Dumbledore's PS shenanigan led Hermione being crippled and forced to attend a Muggle special education school. Fortunately for her, a blind Harry is also there.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10959290/1/][Harry Potter and the Spygirl]]: Super Hermione is activated during the DoM Battle and crashes the Death Eater Party, but she's also a ruthless and trigger happy killer who is way too dangerous for Hogwarts students. She and Harry choose to be tutored privately.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/][Stages of Hope]]: This Hermione is in no shape to return to school even after Voldemort's defeat.
