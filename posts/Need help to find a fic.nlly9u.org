:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi! So there is a Harry/Daphne Fanfic that I can't find anymore! I want to reread it but I forgot the name. In the story Harry had came back in time because his world was messed up. Hermione had created a new Wizengoment called something with a "I". Harry came back in time to stop this. He also came back to find Fleur and marry her again. However, he falls for Daphne. Also I believe Harry was going to come back with Theodore Nott however he died saving Harry for a bomb right before they were about to come back.

  A man lost in the sands of time is back with a vengeance. And this time, it will take more than a dark lord to quench his thirst. Dark! Harry, Slytherin! Harry, Powerful! Harry. Time-Travel. AU.
