*** /'Goddamnit I should check out other species before settling on long lived snakes'/ hissed Voldemort while hitting, yet again, baby Potter with an Avada. Potter burst into the flames, and kept crawling, leaving after himself another charred spot.

His Death Eaters shifted uncomfortably. It was getting embarrassing. Baby Potter gurgled and sat heavily on his bare butt. Bellatrix cooed.

Perspiration appeared on Voldemort's brow. He should hasten his mortal enemy demise before her maternal instincts kick in.

*** If you're gonna get immortality from a Phoenix you might as well get the drawbacks to add a little drama to your immortality. Plain immortality is boring as shit. But if getting it from a Phoenix means you also inherit bursting into flames when you die and becoming a baby for awhile with a smidge of pyromania then it becomes waaaay more interesting.

****** Exactly. They have such good stories. Though Harry is always very powerful and that's actually a plus point for me. I enjoy a powerful Harry. Just not too OP unless it's a humour fic.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

  As the ring melted in Mt. Doom, a new evil emerged from the ashes. But Harry Potter, who has been mysteriously pulled into Middle Earth, wants nothing to do with fighting. He plans to spend the rest of his days in his animagus form, forgetting the past and ignoring the future. That all changes the day an odd trio walks through the woods... Re-writing, updates every other week.
