Reading a Spanish Fic â€˜The Natural order of Things' and half the Dumbledore's been translated to Dumbledog.

It's one thing to bash him, but even Google doing him dirty now.

P.S - The fic doesn't having bashing in it.


** It does sound kind of like a Harry Potter Youtuber. "Hey-oh! It's ya boy, Dumbledog here, back atcha with some fine-ass hypotheticals 'bout our favourite series - Harry Potter!"

The channel picture would be a Grim with a really long, grey beard.
