Would be nice if it's a cracky one...


** Not cracky, but she joined Tom in the Dark Lord business in this one shot [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5492188/1/][Doubting Thomas]], linkffn(5492188).

In the Stargate crossover [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12040341/1/][The Stars Alone]], linkffn(12040341), she was the Empress of their galactic empire and directly controlled its secret police (the equivalent of KGB and SS).

  One Shot. AU. After all, every child deserves a mother who loves them. Even those who grow up to be monsters. Luna just never imagined things would turn out this way. Time Travel.

  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.

** I believe linkffn(On the Delights of Drinking Blood by Quatermass) should somewhat satisfy your request, as it's cracky, but Luna is more of some weird vampire lord mastermind if I recall correctly. Anyways, give it a try.

  (Bashing! Lunar Harmony Poss Harem! Crackfic!) Based on, but not a full response to, DZ2's "Eyeballs to Entrails" challenge. Abducted after his Fourth Year, Harry finds his abductor to be a most unusual person indeed: rising Queen of Magical Britain's Vampires and Pudding Club leader, Luna Lovegood. And she intends to make him her consort, an offer he is surprisingly amenable to...

** ...So is this a trans Luna, or did you forget "Dark Lady" is a thing? Though I definitely support the idea.

*** /Shrugs/ My brain just typed Dark Lord automatically.

Luna being a boy or a girl doesn't really matter as long as she's the glorious leader of the Dark. Although, if there IS a fanfic with Luna as trans and a Dark Lord, then please, let me know. :)
