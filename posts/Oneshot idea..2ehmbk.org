I don't have the writing skills to make this good, but I think it would be funny to see dumbledore try out new candies and freak out when he sees "Dark" Chocolate.


** Send the idea on to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/686093/Rorschach-s-Blot][Rorschach's Blot]], he might be able to expand it more than BadWolf100

*** Don't bother. It's a lame joke, one that's inconsistent with the character even in crackfic. (Dumbledore not only has a sweet tooth, but also his own chocolate frog card. He almost certainly knows a few basic things about chocolate.)

**** I wrote it at five in the morning half conscious. Of course it's a lame joke.

** I got inspired.

Dumbledore sat in his office looking through his honeydukes catalog when he jumped out of his seat and pressed the panic button, locking down the school. He cast an amplifying charm. "Students and Staff. Be on alert. There is a new threat from Voldemort through the form of the mysterious dark chocolate. Repeat be on alert.' He canceled the charm and nestled into his chair. He was unaware the portrates behind him were laughing.

*** Not bad, but a few things to make it better:

#+begin_quote
  He cast a sonorous.
#+end_quote

I think you want the /Amplifying Charm/, whose incantation is "/Sonorous/." The /Sonorous/ charm (to the extent that the video games are part of canon) does something else entirely.

Your quotes are mismatched. Also, you end with a sentence fragment.
