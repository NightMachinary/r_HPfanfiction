Maybe Merope still dies in child birth, but Tom decides that the sins of the mother are not those of the son, and takes him from the orphanage. How would Voldemort turn out with a father figure to turn to?


** Second this. A millionaire half-blood Tom Riddle without abandonment issues in Slytherin, sounds interesting.

*** Dad gets killed by pureblood activists after Tommy-boy tattles on the Gaunts, becomes SNAKEMAN.

Lily Evans becomes a poor biological researcher/herbologist, is betrayed and has her research stolen, fakes her death and becomes POISON LILY.

Peter Pettigrew ends up in the wrong crowd, somehow achieves success, becomes the PLATYPUS (aka the closest thing to both a penguin and a rat getting together.)

Sirius Black goes crazy after his family betrays him, becoming THE PRANKSTER. And that's all I got.

** Perhaps in the long term his war would be against the Purebloods who look down on muggle-raised wizards such as himself. Coming from money, he might have had less of a trophy-taking fetish; that would make horcruxes that much harder to track down. With resources in the UK he might not have left Britain for so long. If he had stayed local and retained his identity it would probably be a matter of time before such a powerful wizard gained high office in the ministry, a position at Hogwarts or even a spot on the Wizengamot.

He would probably be sociopathic still, but with less of a bleeding grievance. Overall he would be a more forbiddable threat to any Chosen One.

It's a short one shot, but the only one like this I've seen and it's a neat concept.

** I'd go with basically normal, probably a bit spoiled like Draco Malfoy is. Sociopaths are made, not born, so he likely wouldn't be one at all with a loving father instead of his experiences in the orphanage. Magically powerful, able to speak with snakes, maybe a bit of a recluse like the other Riddles seemed to be; standoffish. Highly doubt he'd be an evil Dark Lord.

**** That's not true, it's something a fan made up. One of her actual quotes goes: "It was a symbolic way of showing that he came from a loveless union -- but of course, everything would have changed if Merope had survived and raised him herself and loved him."

  Being the recipient of the Order of Merlin and also having his picture on the Chocolate Frog Cards was not a big feat for Healer Tom Riddle. As Head Healer at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, nothing much surprised him. Little did he know, his life was about to be turned upside down by the arrival of a bespectacled boy with messy hair through the Veil.
