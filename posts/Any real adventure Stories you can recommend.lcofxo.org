Im looking for a real adventure story with Harry being at least 15 or older. I prefer it to be real and without sugarcoating anything. If there is violence it should be violent, if there is war it should be gruesome, if there is love it should be heartwarming. I think you get it:). And please no slash. I hope there is something interesting out there.


** If you like AUs, I've written "Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis". Quite bloody battles with no sugarcoating.

  AU. Having been raised by his tomb raiding aunt, Harry Potter had known early on that he'd follow in her footsteps and become a Curse-Breaker, discovering and exploring old tombs full of lost knowledge and treasure. But he and his two best friends might have underestimated just how dangerous the wrong sort of knowledge and treasure could be. Sequel to "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider".
