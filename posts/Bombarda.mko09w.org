I've been wondering why wizard keep changing then spells they're using in battle. Like, why doesn't everybody keep throwing fucking Bombardas Maxima and explode the enemy?

Sure, they could shield with a Protego, but exploding the ground sounds good too.

Honestly, the way wizards fight in canon, and in fanon, makes me think they're all brain dead.


** Well, Bombarda specifically is a movie spell.

Yes and no. If you're trying to blow up a whole street without a care for who you kill? Yes. If you're in close quarters with allies? No.

*** Well "*Reducto*" is in book cannon and is pretty much the same thing.

** Because while it might kill your enemies, it might also kill you/your allies. They change spells to take their enemies by surprise. Doing one spell over and over again isn't helpful.

** I mean yeah, the way they fight in canon is absolutely idiotic, except for when there's allies nearby, a body landing on an ally wouldn't really help that ally in a fight.

But in a one on one duel, like the Dumbledore-Voldemort duel, they were constantly apparating and sending stuff at each other, that's how I see one on one wizard duels going, they apparate and shoot and disappear again. Of course Dumbledore and Voldemort can probably go at it for fifty times longer but that doesn't change the point.

** JKR assumed that wizards would take this amazing power they have and just stand around shooting Stupefy at each other. What's not to love about that? ðŸ˜‚

** Probably because if you know what you're doing it's pretty easy to shield against shockwaves and debris from explosions. You'd be putting a ton of effort into damaging your surroundings without doing much to the enemy.

** But every spell except Unforgivables can be blocked by a Protego. So It doesn't matter which one you throw at them.
