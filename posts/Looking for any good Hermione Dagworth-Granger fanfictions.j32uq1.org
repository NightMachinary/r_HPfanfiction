The title says it all. I recently fell down the HDG rabbit hole and I'm looking for a good fix to read. Any suggestions are appreciated


** May I ask what you mean by using the surname Dagworth-Granger instead of just Granger , for Hermione?

** The only fics I could remember are Hermione Dagworth Granger linkffn(13408953) and Touched Your Lips linkffn(12880417) where Hermione's pretending to be a Dagworth-Granger.

Though now I'm curious, what fic(s) did you read that made you interested?

#+begin_quote
  A Healer who travels back in time accidentally to cure Abraxas Malfoy from Dragon Pox. Sounds impossible, but Hermione finds herself in that very position. The Malfoys do not leave this be and Hermione now has allies to bring down Voldemort. Only if she hadn't met with a young struggling Sirius Black. There is one more person she can't resist.

*** Sorry for the late reply! I've been going back and rereading 'Of Cunning and Courage' by Moxified on ffn. It's a very good fic that I highly recommend that features Hermione in Slytherin, familial ties to Sirius Black, and Snape being a mentor.

** You might like the Black Book series linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18111758/chapters/42816263]]). It's kinda Sirius centric but the HDG twist is very fun.
