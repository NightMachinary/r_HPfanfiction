I don't really care if it's to Tom Riddle's school days, to the Marauders' Era, to his own first year...

I want to see Ron Weasley strategizing his way through time travel! There are so, so many Harry or Hermione - or Harry /and/ Hermione - time-travel fics, and even if he's not my favorite character, I think it'd be really cool to see Ron in that kind of situation.

My searches have been fruitless, so I thought I'd come here for help. Thank you to all suggestions in advance!


** Hi! Don't really have a time traveling Ron for you but I do have a dimension traveling Ron! It is great. I cried. linkao3(27105)

  When Ron Weasley realized he was reborn to the world with his memories mostly intact, he felt it was a second chance to do better. However, he slowly realizes that this world was different from his own. Making new friends and earning new enemies, he has to use his experience from his previous life not only to reach his goals, but also to survive. AU

  Ron has the ability to see the future and he has the choice to either let it happen or change it for the better. Not Powerful!Ron. Pairings undecided as of the moment. Latest chapter for fifth year now here! Thanks for reading! Will continue until 7th year.
