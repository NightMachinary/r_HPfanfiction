I've seen fics where he goes to the police or to the teachers at his school, but never the local clergy.

** I don't think I've heard of anything like that, no.

That's an interesting thought. I wonder how the priest would respond? The Dursleys are 'normal' which means they almost certainly go to church, but probably only for holidays like Christmas or Easter. So they likely wouldn't have had the chance to fill the priest's head with lies and he might be more sympathetic to Harry. The problem would be: if the priest does ask around he'll almost certainly start hearing those nasty stories.

This does strike me as an interesting spin though, Hogwarts School of Prayer and Miracles, but not flippant? Harry starts thinking maybe what he can do is miracles, not sure if he should say anything, wondering if he might be the antichrist or the second coming, friendly priest being equally confused and not sure what to do; maybe talks to his superiors that bump it up the chain until they hit someone high enough up to know about magic? Harry being a little bummed that Hogwarts doesn't even have a chapel? Hmm.... there is some christ-wank HP stuff already, so keeping it from becoming tedious would take some finesse, but as a starting point if nothing else, this has potential.

**** The Pope is head of state of Vatican City, so he might be in the loop on magic, depending on how the Italian Ministry of Magic works.

...But since the Dursleys live in England, the "normal" religion for Christians would be Anglican Protestantism, not Roman Catholic.

Regardless, that'd mean the Dursleys would have even less reason to prejudice the priest against Harry, so if he does get the idea of appealing to him for help, things would go even better. And more interesting, as we watch the Dursleys try to figure out what to do with a newly-religious Harry!

** There is one, but for the life of me I can't find it. If I remember, Remus starts spending time with Harry and the local priest also takes an interest in him, wanting to help him.

If I'm remembering, the Priest does a lot of outreach to the local teen community and there are Saturday night dances? Harry matures quite a bit, but all the kids are still kids, and it's a very age appropriate story. Might be the same one where he has a crush on an older girl who's trying to make her ex boyfriend jealous, or something along those lines.

I feel like this is post 4th or 5th year, and is old enough to have come out while waiting for the next book.
