** *Seventh Horcrux*, linkffn(10677106), completed last year, already a classic.

*The Adventures Of Harry Potter, the Video Game: Exploited*, linkffn(9708318), is a crackfic, but for people who have played those games before, be warned you could get yourself hurt by laughing too hard. The following is a description of Harry's first weapon, Hufflepuff's Shovel:

#+begin_quote
  Upon picking up the small hand shovel, a chorus of trumpets sounded and a word bubble popped up in Harry's vision, just as the shovel grew in length to be a full dirt shovel longer than Harry was tall and painted in yellow and black spirals up the handle and checkered across the shovels head/blade.

  "Tada! With hard labor and diligent work, you've earned the "Hufflepuff Harry" title and a new tool and weapon, the Hufflepuff Shovel. For when there is shit to be done, we know you'll be there diligently shoveling it!"

  Harry looked rather nonplussed by his new weapon/tool. "Hardy har har, you're a regular laugh riot is what you are." Harry groused as he looked over his shovel.

  "Inventory," Harry called, getting ready to put away his new weapon, only to find a new tab in his inventory called "Weapons." Touching the tab, an expanded area of the chest opened up like closet or armory; though it was rather bare armory with only one Pointy Stick resting on a weapons rack. Still, the addition of the Weapons armory gave Harry some new information he hadn't had before as floating above the Pointy Stick on its rack was the weapons Statistics of: 1 melee attack/1 defense. As Harry set down the shovel in a weapon rack, its statistics floated above it: 3 melee attack/1 defense, Plus 2 to Herbology when wielding Hufflepuff Shovel and Plus 1 to attempts to Hide Bodies or turn them into fertilizer.

  Harry paled at the last two details, "I'm never going to look badly at Hufflepuffs again." Harry stated definitively.

  Closing his inventory and shaking off the shivers that came from imaging Madame Sprout and how she made her fertilizer, Harry looked around at all the collecting he had done and realized he was done with that for now.

  Harry Potter catches Voldemort's AK to the noggin only to find out that his life is a video game and he forgot to save. So what does he do? Does he return on Hard mode and work for the challenge? Heck No! Harry uses every exploit, grind, or underhanded tactic he can get his hands on. His life may be a video game, but nobody plays Harry Potter; Harry's going to exploit the system.

  AU: The first wizarding friend Harry made wasn't Ronald Weasley... it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter in the Weasley clan for generations. And suddenly the future of the wizarding world, not to mention Harry's first year at Hogwarts, looked very different. Not a canon rehash, not a romance. STORY COMPLETE, SEQUEL POSTED

** I cannot for the life of me remember the name, but it was a Marauder-era fic written in the style of notes and letters being passed between the Marauders and Lily (And a few others, IIRC). Starts off with Lily stealing James' glasses in retaliation for some prank James pulled.

  - At 14 years old, Harry wasn't really ready for the Triwizard. If not for Hermione and Barty Crouch Jr, the poor boy would likely have done himself a whole lot of damage if left to his own devices... Of course, if not for Crouch he wouldn't have been IN the tourney, but that's another story. So, I asked myself what if things had gone a bit differently? What if his broom hadn't shown up? What if other... opportunities presented themselves?- There are those who say, if you're not cheating, you're not trying.

  Hey, wouldn't it be cool if someone took as many fanfic cliches as possible and stuffed them all into one story? No? Well, I went ahead and did it anyway. Multi-chapter Mockfic. This summary is actually a lot better than I originally thought.
