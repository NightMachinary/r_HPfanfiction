I recently read a fanfic (can't remember which one) where the author gave an example of what the characters would look like using real people and I personally don't really care either way but I am wondering what everyone else prefers or thinks about it.


** I wouldn't read a fic like that. So much of writing is about the descriptions, you know? I mean, did they just put a link in the text like "Daphne approached [A/N she looks like [[https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/n-biq04i/cbqahpd/products/818/images/1070/crew_cut_wig_for_men__14740.1404862843.500.750.jpg?c=2][this]] ]

It sounds way too jarring.

*** The people who do it often refer to actors in their ANs at the bottom of the chapter, not in the middle of the story.

*** My principal is that the reader should be the one to imagine how they look. You can mention it in reference e.g. Harry wears his invisibility cloak around his neck, but you shouldn't say what color any of it is. Unless there is a very good reason, we don't need to know if that pocket is the pocket of a robe or the pocket of a pair of short shorts.

Exceptions are events where clothing matters such as a specific meeting, ritual, or anything else. One sentence is all that should be used to describe it too.

** It's called fancasting, and people do it when they didn't like the movie actor portrayal, or they're writing at a different time period than when the movie is set. Eg, Sirius Black in a Marauders era fic fancasted with Ben Barnes instead of Gary Oldman.

I prefer the author describe in-text what the character looks like and leave it to the readers to imagine their looks. When authors use real life people, it gives me instant flashbacks to My Immortal, where Enoby compares people to Gerard Way or Amy Lee, who are IRL musicians. (And if u don't know who they are, gtfo preps!)

*** It's one thing to say in-text that a certain character resembles an actor or actress.

But I think it's another if you go along with canon descriptions for characters in story - so Hermione has bushy brown hair not a blonde undercut and Ron doesn't dye his hair blue - but also have in the authors notes a 'hey, this is how I visualise the canon characters looking' as opposed to the actors who played them in the movies.

** I don't like it in the text, but I enjoy seeing the author's fancasts on their tumblrs/websites. This is how I was introduced to the idea of Luca Hollestelle as Ginny, which I love.

Hell, don't use author's notes in general. Your story needs to stand on its own two feet.

** I've seen that plenty of times, mostly it would be something in the author's notes about who they would "cast" to play that character and it's not very intrusive. I'm sure there are more than a few examples of it being completely terrible though.

** It's fucking awful, and not just because it's lazy ass writing (or lack thereof) and breaks the pace, but especially because LINKS FUCKING DECAY YOU NUTTER AUTHOR. Literally everytime I happened upon this shit in a ffnet fic, I got a 404.

AO3 is better in this regard, since authors can embed pics in the fic, but still I don't believe they add much to the story, and should be supplementary like in kiddie books rather than a substitute for actual description.

** I have my own images of what people look like, unless there is some reason to see it as the writer writes it, it's like Checkov's rifle, there has to be a good reason to do this. If not it is just poor writing skills IMO.

a perfect example is so many writers use Alan Rickman's portrayal of Snape as their guide. Snape as described in canon is NOT the Snape of Alan Rickman.

** I think I prefer it when people put them in rather than show a picture because it tends to feel like a cop out. Mind you, I think I was 20+ chapters in when I realised one of my characters hadn't been described other than a single sentence so I'm not the best at it.
