:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I tried to find this before, but no luck, so hopefully this time I get something. Harry has been spending his time doing speedruns of beating Voldemort. Eventually the hat, who for some reason can communicate with Sorting Hats of different universes offers Harry the opportunity to go to a different, more difficult universe. Harry ends up in a world where Hufflepuff and Gryffindor are the houses with a huge rivalry and eventually the Monster of Hufflepuff gets released and Harry transfers to Beuxbatons.

If anybody here remembers the author/what it was called or has it's link, please let me know!

Thanks in advance! :)

Harry hops on his Broomstick "I don't want to live in this school anymore."

Also, what would the monster be? The Stay Puft Marshmallow Man?

*** Actually it was never mentioned what the monster actually was, but from what I remembered, every time he thought about it he shuddered.

**** That's hilarious.

But isn't Badger another term for the female genitalia?

He'd be a badger tongue.
