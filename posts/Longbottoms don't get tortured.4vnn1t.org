Looking for fics where the Longbottoms aren't tortured. Harry is still the BWL. Bonus points if they raise Harry.


** odd, never seen one. i can image a no boy who lived story, harry neville and ron and hermione become the new maruders. it would be a terrible fic of course, full of aragont twats prank warring there way to hell resulting in the death of malfoy...

** I read one (A Marauder's Plan) where they were still in St. Mungos but it was secretly due to a senility potion and once they were off it they were weak but fine. Everyone still thought they were in there due to the Cruciatus though.
