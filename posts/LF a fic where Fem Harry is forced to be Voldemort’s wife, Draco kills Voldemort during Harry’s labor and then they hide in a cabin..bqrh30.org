:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Everyone thinks Harry is dead,

I'm pretty sure Voldemort transfigured Harry into a woman.

Voldemort keeps killing their children because he wants an heir.

Harry has severe ptsd and anxiety and doesn't want to let go of her kid.

She also has trouble judging lengths of time.

The Malfoys save a bunch of Muggleborns by buying them as servants.

There was an award ceremony near the end.

Pretty sure it was on AO3 but not positive.


** I don't know that story but I am having anxiety just by reading that description.
