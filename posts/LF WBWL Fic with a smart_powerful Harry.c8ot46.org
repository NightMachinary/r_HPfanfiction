Harry doesn't have to be cynical and nihilistic like in Deprived linkffn(Deprived)

He can find something else that makes him happy like in linkffn(Harry Potter and The Veela).

Either works to be honest.

​

All pairings are fine, just no slash. No H/HG unless it's reaaaaaaalllllyyy good.

Thanks!

Edit: A complete fic is desirable but not necessary


** I'm not the only one by Potato19 is a WIP Hr/H that has some promise for this genre though it's a WIP

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12365803/1/]]

Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi is not a wbwl story but had several elements of one (Harry is more intelligent and smart than his twin). Again this is a WIP but worth a read.

** linkao3(12608820) The Sarcasm and Slytherin series is on book 5 and features a fairly dark Harry. I think the think I enjoy a lot about this is that Lily is dead but James is not. Harry and the twin brother have a contentious relationship that goes back and forth a lot between bitter rivals and somewhat friends. Link is to the first book, Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes.

linkffn(11191235) Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin is another extensive one. It's currently on the third year plot. I liked the worldbuilding in this one, and I'm intrigued by what's happening in the plot.

(Funny note, both S&S and HPPOS have very similar plots in the first book and a half, but they do diverge, and the authors had come up with them separately.)

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Harry Potter's world is flipped upside down when he is unexpectedly visited by a naked fairy on his fourteenth birthday. Finding out that he is a rare species of incubus known as a Choiceling is the least of Harry's problems when he discovers just how drastically his life is about to change. How will our young hero deal with an entire year at Hogwarts when he has to have sex at least once a day just to survive?! Join Harry on an epic tale of love, lust, and innocence, as he battles against much more than just dark wizards and learns just how strong bonds can be.
