Hi yall. I am new to the community and I recently decided to write a fic. I am looking for a beta and maybe a co writer. Mostly cause I am not the best writer out there and I dont wanna make something half done. The plans are for it to be a twist on the wbwl trope. Something that can be seen as an original concept. I also plan to add in some of the challenges out just for heck of it and see how well I can do. So yeah. Let me know if your interested.


** Can you give me more information on your plan? Like a brief overview of the story? If it appeals to me I may be willing to beta.

*** Well I had always liked the idea of Harry having a blood related sibling. Basically my thought was this. I had heard of stories were Dudly was also a wizard. Basically both the Potter brother were dropped off at the Dursley's after James and Lily died. ,Leon( my oc potter) never showed any signs of accidental magic while growing while Harry showed plenty of bouts of freakish things. This led to the Dursleys treating Harry as they did in canon(maybe a bit more abusive, I mean I doubt they could treat him with any sympathy if they had locked him in the cupboard) while they treated Leon like Dudley. (Dudly was never born, They raise Leon in his place.) That's is just the begining of course. I plan on giving about two or three chapters to their development at the Dursley's. I came up with it cause I was looking for a way for Leon to actually be antagonistic towards Harry. I mean James and Lily would never have raised a snot nosed brat. When they /both/ get their letters I plan on showing the hypocrisy of the Dursley's by having them keep their attitudes the same. "Oh my boy. You have done this family proud." Leon beamed at the praise from his father Vernon. And yeah. I think I just went and overexplained my idea. Oh well.

**** I like the idea. So do you have any ideas on the personality of Harry, the friends of both, the opinions both of Leon and Harry, others opinions of them? And what side of the war he is on? What are their characteristics? What will they look like? What are their strengths and weaknesses? What house do you think they will go to? What about love interests? What about the Dursley's reaction to Leon when/if he gets his Hogwarts letter? What kind of magical outburst does Harry have? Just a few things to think about. Do you have any ideas for answers of the above questions?

***** Well. For their houses I do have answers. I think I am gonna send Leon into Slytherin. His personality is gonna be kinda like Dudley's except more cunning. He will plan and use anything to get his goal. Harry is gonna go to Hufflepuff. For two reasons. This Harry is gonna be the kinda of person if you earn their loyalty they will go through hell for you but if you break it your not getting it back. Plus I feel Hufflepuff is underused. My plan for the war is for Voldemort to corrupt Leon and then be killed by Leon who becomes a Dark Lord. Harry is gonna try and spend his time in school gaining allies to fight with him. My plan is for them to kill each other. Can you guess why? Hint(What is on Dumbledore's finger the 6th year.)

****** The Deathly Hallows. As of right now, I think I am willing to be your Beta. What about the school? Will they turn on one of them or the other? What will Dumbledore's opinion of them be? What will their relationship be with the teachers? In what ways will Harry be abused, and how will that affect his actions? Will anyone notice his abuse? (I am willing to beta no matter what your answers are to the questions, I just want to have a better sense of the story. Unless something comes up, I will) Also, what site are you going to use?

******* True he is wearing the stone of resurrection. I meant more along the lines of the horcrux part. Dumbledore is in my opinion Dumbledore. While I personally dont like his choices he did what he did. If he could I think he would change what he did. So not bashing but not Good Dumbles. Leon and Harry will have an antagonistic relationship towards each other except at the end. My Idea is that the horcrux tries to take over Leon and Harry but Lilys scrafice also allowed Harry's soul to kind link with Leon to help fight off the influence. That is why Voldemort is able to corrupt Leon with the Horcrux since it is only be fought off by his and Harry's soul. But with them hating each other the soul link is weakened. Lily's scrafice is in a ritual she made in the Hope's of being able to create a bridge between souls in the hope of being able to help on another heal. So if a person was in a coma a person could be linked to them to then have them wake up. Make sense. I hope it does. The process of this ritual basically involves ripping the two souls from their bodies and then using the soul of a scrafice as the building material for the bridge. Lily's was hoping that if Voldemort tried to kill one her children then bridge could hopefully let them survive. Thankfully it did. Just not in the way she was hoping. The killing curse split itself in two when it hit Leon. One part of Leon's soul was killed and a part of Voldemort was killed. Then since creating a horcrux splits the soul there was two peices left. One went to Harry but was very small. The other went to Leon and was much larger. Ahhhhhh. See . I often overextend on certain ideas.

******** It made sense. Now that I have a sense of the background, can you give me a quick summary of both what would happen in the full story and what would happen each year? Also, what site are planning to use?
