:END:
Fanfic where people blame Harry for not being the chosen one (his parents did all the work!) and the ministry tries to sue him for falsely being the BWL. Dumbledore declares Ron as the BWL/Chosen One


** "That night, fifteen years ago, Lord Voldemort attacked you as you were on your play date with Mr Potter. His soul broke and looked for the nearest container."

"That means Harry..."

"That's right, Ronald. Mr Potter shares a close connection with Lord Voldemort for this reason, and it is for this, that I for so long thought he was the Chosen One. Destined to be his foe. When it is clear now, that this person is you."

"But I don't get it. Harry has the connection, it may be him."

"It's simple really, you possess the power he knows not. Voldemort took Harry as a vessel then because he was the only nearby soul he could find. You, Ronald, as a ginger, lack a soul... something is our last weapon against Voldemort's Horcruxes!"
