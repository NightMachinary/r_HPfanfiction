Assuming the entire thing would just be 'oh shithead dad gets Custody because he's a Pureblood' is an incredible jump. Legally, too, it's incredibly hard for the man to get custody.

**** Canon is through the lens of Harry so there is no clear cut case of this, you are correct. But how much do we miss? Harry is a student who really doesn't ever see much of the wizarding world. We simply don't know how the Wizarding World operates towards muggleborns; there isn't much evidence one way or the other.

But what we do see? Dolores Umbridge as the Senior Undersecretary, Lucius Malfoy controlling the Minister. When people in power hold to certain beliefs, those beliefs manifest themselves in governmental policies. The question is did these sorts of people hold power around 1985ish, when a custody decision would be made. We don't really know, but I doubt its too far fetched.

Does this require some extrapolation? Yes. I don't think its too unreasonable to suggest that something like this could occur.

***** Umbridge doesn't express a Pureblood agenda until she is told to by Voldemort controlled ministry officials. Her whole shtick is a moral-less government official that is only interested in personal gain and power. Before that she was anti half-breed creatures, there's no indication she cared one way or the other about purebloods as long as they weren't part donkey or something.

Lucius Malfoy is nothing more than a wealthy donor. And while that can provide some perks, IE World Cup Tickets, that does not mean he can influence governmental policy. In fact, the only time he seems to try is before Harry's trial in the fifth year. And Fudge would have likely had the same reaction he does without any of Malfoy's posturing as Fudge is terrified of losing his job if Voldemort is actually back. It's purely a lack of understanding of political systems to assume a donor has a massive amount of sway. And we don't even know if Malfoy even donates to Fudge, as his one direct contribution was to St. Mungos.

We also see multiple scenes of people in the wizarding world helping out muggleborns or muggles. IE the Granger's getting helped at Gringotts. And Muggleborns are invited, openly, to receive 100$ governmental subsidized education at Hogwarts. So obviously the government doesn't have a bias toward that there. And we know they at least have some sort of economy which wouldn't be possible if a large subset of the economic base was openly prejudiced against.

You point out 'how much do we miss' which could very well be a lot. But Harry, as a character, points out and notices cases of abject racism. So we would likely assume he would do the same thing if he saw or heard them otherwise. And you simply take a point and immediately assume the negative of everything.

You ignore the fact that what we're presented of as a Pureblood Minority would have just lost a war over these ideals. You're argument, to me, is akin to saying 'A jew wouldn't get custody in Germany in 1952 because they're Jewish'.

The difference is that likely would have been the case in 1937 Germany. But we're presented a Wizarding World where the Centralized government was actually assisting in the fight against the Pureblood radicals Logically, then, the government wouldn't have the same ideals as the Pureblood radicals or they wouldn't have been fighting the war.

It requires extrapolation in what feels like the completely wrong direction.

****** I think it's rather naive to state donors don't have large sway in political systems. We aren't very clued in in HP, but in real politics you need a large amount of donated money just to run for office, meaning you /will/ more often listen to your donors as a matter of practical consequence: No money, little chance of winning (advertisements, booking venues for political events, etc.), and the donors are nearly always those who have huge sums to give.

But that's all a tangent, I don't think we see much or any of that make it into actual policy in HP until DH, and certainly nothing regarding custody cases, as you say. The political system was not much focused on anyway. The closest we get is Sirius's suspicion that Arcturus bought his Order of Merlin. But even then, I don't think the OoM confer any direct political power, just general prestige so it's a bit moot I guess.

******* The government in HP doesn't act like a typical elected government. At least that we see. It acts more as a small monitoring bureaucracy. Historically, the sway of individualized donors on elections is very minimal. Larger groups and PACS and what not is a different analogy. But the assumption that one donor holds any sway over an official in Harry Potter seems off.

It does not help that we don't even see, or hear about, elections. So as far as that goes we're not even really told how the government works. There seems to be very little actual legislating in the wizarding world as is.

****** Wealth translates directly into political power. People like the Koch brothers have tremendous political clout because of their wealth. Lucius Malfoy is no different, he gives his money with the expectation of political change that aligns with his views. Donating to St. Mungos served a purpose, to change his public image from a criminal to a respected member of society. It wasn't out of kindness.

They aren't giving them the tuition out of kindness, but rather for secrecy. Motivation here is important. Leaving a child with no idea how to control their magic is dangerous, not only to themselves but the Statute of Secrecy. I don't think that really shows a lack of bias, but rather policies that are a necessity.

The centralized government was actually assisting in the fight? Why did the Order of Phoenix get created if the government was taking an active and effective stance? Furthermore /they lost/. Voldemort wins the Wizarding War if it wasn't for a quirk in fate. Even then this government lets a large portion of criminals escape prosecution. It almost seems that they disapproved of Voldemort's methods rather than his ideals, letting those who spew his ideology free without any form of punishment.

Harry points out the racism of Draco Malfoy. He is not present in wizarding society to see how muggleborns are treated so he can't point them out, he spends all of his time in the Wizarding World at school. That's hardly telling of how society is run.

Did they really lose the war? What did the defeat of Lord Voldemort accomplish? I don't think we really see any concrete changes in Wizarding society as a result. If anything the war was just put on pause until Voldemort returned.

I don't think your analogy holds in this case. I would liken this to a white man and a black woman in the early 1900s in America. Who gets custody? The white man if he so desires, he has wealth and political clout where the black woman has neither. This is a generalization but I believe it applies to this scenario.

Ish. The Koch Brothers have less sway than the media likes to give them credit for. Also, they have very little sway as individuals. The sway comes from the foundations that they have and the economy they are responsible for. It's closer to Harvey Weinstein donating to the Hillary Campaign. Do you think she actually gave a damn about Harvey's political views or allowed that to affect her proposed government at all?

We do not know that Lucius Malfoy does anything other than is 'old wealthy british aristocrat'.

Yes, the government is fighting them. We're told directly that aurors were allowed to use Unforgivables on suspected Death Eaters. And the whole Crouch SR 'Imprisonment without trial' measures. To say the government is not active against Voldemort is inherently wrong.

We also have no idea if they 'let a large portion of criminals escape' as we don't have the numbers directly. We also are never presented with actual evidence against them. It's hard enough to prove things in trials that don't include magic. Simply throwing any suspect in Prison is a horribly way to run a government. Still, that's the route they go. So explain how, the government that resorted to not even having trials for Death Eaters is actually pushing their pureblood agenda?

But we know they had enough in prison that Voldemort felt the need to break them out.

******** Compared to someone like you or me? They have enormous sway. When someone like Bill Gates talks people listen. That's a form of political power.

We do have evidence, he managed to oust Dumbledore during second year from his position as Headmaster. That alone would take a large amount of sway to remove someone like Albus Dumbledore from his post, even if it did not last.

Being formally at war and having policies against Voldemort is different from actually fighting them. Laws and treaties don't mean anything if there isn't real force behind them. We don't have evidence that they made any /real/ effort against LV. Regardless we know that the Ministry was largely ineffective fighting Voldemort in both Wizarding Wars.

Veritaserum seems to be an easy way that could have been used to easily determine guilt. Maybe the ministry didn't even try to convict them, rather accept whatever platitudes or bribes they gave. Or pehaps Veritaserum is just a plot hole, as guilt would almost never be in question with such a powerful potion at your disposal. Although fanfiction uses Purebloods are immune from this potion I doubt that was the case, they just either didn't bother using it or it was an oversight by JK.

Nor are we even sure that's exactly what happened unless we take Dumbledore at 100%. I don't even think Dumbledore believes that's what happens, he's just posturing and pointing out that the fickle support Malfoy had, is gone.

For all we know it's a three man board. You also imply that wealth got there, but wealth isn't used in that situation that's mentioned.

Also you're implying that it's unheard of that the head of a school is removed during a crisis in which something inside the school is attacking students and the headmaster can provide no answer for it. Honestly, that's easily a fireable offense.

Lucius Malfoy does nothing in that situation that your average PTA Mom wouldn't have done. Honestly, Dumbledore SHOULD have been fired and the school should have been closed. Aside from the fact that Malfoy is indirectly responsible for what's occurring, his reaction is exactly what every parent's reaction should be in that situation.
