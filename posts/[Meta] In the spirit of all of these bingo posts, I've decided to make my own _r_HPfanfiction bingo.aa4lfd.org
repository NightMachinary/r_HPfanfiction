** "HP And The Never-Ending Fic finally updated after 9 years!!" lmao. Bonus points for that one if you've never even heard of it before. The only things I'm missing are disgusting smut, complaining about Cursed Child and some clown really wanting to discuss sexual violence.

*** OP: "Hey guys, I'm looking for a fic where Harry lives a happy childhood and is generally trusting of adults, also he has a big dick and likes to use it."

Fic author: "Well, I've just posted chapter 3 of my story involving a Harry who is violently abused by the Dursleys, hates all authority figures, and has a small dick which he never uses, not even to pee. Doesn't fit all your criteria but check it out!"

That one actually annoys me a bit if its overused, often with an OP!Harry who isn't somewhat of a Rational!Harry. "How does that work?" "Magic, bro!"

** Don't forget

-Incredibly broad requests that encompass basically every fic

-Downvoting for slash or “wrong lIrings”(sometimes it seems like we're a step away from Tumblr's dark corner's witch hunts)

-Posts discussion whether or not to downvote slash getting 10x the upvotes and comments as everything else

-Weird fetishes that make mpreg Veela rape slaves seem vanilla

-Bland,overdone trope that attracts 13 year-old girls but * insert subversion of trope *

-DAE HPMoR bad?

-DAE Turn by Sara's Girl?
