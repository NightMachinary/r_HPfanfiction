**** Just as an FYI - while the original author has discontinued that particular story, she okayed another author adopting it and there's a pretty good continuation on aff.net that updates regularly: [[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=60009]]

(It is rated M - so ignore if you're not 'old enough' :)

***** I didn't know someone adopted it, so I'm excited about a decent continuation of a fic I enjoyed. But your link wasn't complete. For anyone curious: [[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=600095379][Harry Potter and the Breeding Darkness]] as continued by Danyealle-sama.
