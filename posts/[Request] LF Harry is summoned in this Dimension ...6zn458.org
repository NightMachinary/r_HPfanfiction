I am looking for one or more stories, with the following premise:

A Hero is called/summoned into this dimension. This Hero is "coincidentally" a powerful Version of Harry.

In this new Dimension he meets: - a younger version of himself, or - a female version of himself, or - his Mother (as Woman who lived, all other Potters a dead)

I have read stories in the past, which has this as basis. And as so often, I do not remember the titles. Maybe someone remembers reading something like that.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12446118/1/Intersecting-Realities][Intersecting Realities]], linkffn(12446118), is decent, and I greatly appreciate that the author doesn't bash Dumbledore, as his later cooperation with the local GWL is a delight to read.

  Voldemort is back, he can be stopped but all things come at a price. Someone called for a hero but he said no, ripped from his own reality he jumps again. Will he be more helpful this time? AU femHarry.

**** It's not the best fic out there, but I at least enjoy it more than those usual 'Harry meets his younger self' fics loaded with bashing and tropes.

** linkffn(0800-Rent-A-Hero by brainthief) has a somewhat canon compliant version of Harry meeting a younger female version of himself. linkffn(On a Pale Horse by Hylian) has an OP Master of Death Harry summoned where he meets teenage self

  AU. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. MoD!Harry, Godlike!Harry, Unhinged!Harry. Dumbledore bashing.

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP
