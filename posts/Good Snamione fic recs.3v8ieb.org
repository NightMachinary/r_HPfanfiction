I've read pretty much all the really popular, well known ones and need new Snamione fics to read :D I'm 22, so M-rated is fine (and even welcomed ;) )

Don't mind the type- time travel fic, marriage law, post-hogwarts, during, and etc. Will read anything so long as it is well written and Snamione.

I prefer long fics as opposed to short things/one-shots, but will read short things if it is really good :D

Thanks in advance folks!


** Assuming you read mostly on ff.net, you might like the website [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/]] - need to make an account to read the more risque stuff though. Good site, has a section for all the complete fics.

*** Thanks, this was a great reply!

For the Potion Master's Amusement is one of my absolute favourites. I'm in the scene myself, so I love the BDSM aspect ^{^}

Not read 'Before I saw Your Face' and it sounds amazing, so thanks so much!!! :D

** I'm sure you've read 'Camerado' by Milliejoan - if not, it's a WIP but really beautiful. Angsty.

I also love 'Self Slain Gods on Strange Altars' by Scumblackentropy. WIP, possibly abandoned, super messed up, and angsty.

Both on fanfiction.net and probably ashwinder.

**** Ah, if you haven't heard of ashwinder prior to this, check it out for sure. Also check out archiveofourown.org - I highly recommend:

Cantata for Three Voices in G Major (by Wirefish1) - WIP

Also, not Snamione but probably one of the most beautiful (short) works I've read:

'Every Saint is an Accident' by teddyradiator

Also on ashwinder, and archive of our own, anything by lariope, melusin, anoesis, tychesong etc etc.

Sorry, I don't read much fanfiction nowadays, but those authors really are fantastic. And there are a billion others that I adored that I'm omitting because of time ... check out ashwinder and archive of our own!

***** I like archive of our own :-) Dunno how I've never come across ashwinder before, but it's safe to say that's my life ruined for the next few days haha :P thanks so much!

** Have you read 'post tenebras lux' and 'chasing the sun' by loten? Both are amazing, very different, long chaptered stories. Both rated M.

** Pet Project is my all time favorite Snamione!

I haven't found one that captures my attention the same way yet. Checking everything mentioned in this thread that I haven't already red.

** linkffn(Unfinished Business)

Send Not To Know - linkffn(9906065) I read this one every Christmas. One of my favorites!

Princess of Gryffindor - [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=26761]] Excellent story. One I lost and found again. Was 100% worth the re-read.

Of Muggles and Magic - linkffn(6608051) This one was interesting, and enjoyable. Took me a couple chapters to really get into it.

Practical Solutions - [[http://www.fanfiction-junkies.de/efiction/viewstory.php?sid=2377]] - This one is hilarious, smutty, glorious. Absolute fave!

Another Dream - [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=26682]]

Getting Past Broken - [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=27871]]

Transcendent Quality of Remembrance - [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=26761]]

Yet Everything Remains The Same - [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=26009]]

  Hermione quite literally crashes her way back through time by roughly twenty years. There is no going back; the only way is to go forward. And when one unwittingly interferes with time, what one expects may not be what time finds...
