Hermione is reborn as Lily's lilttle sister and keeps a low profile because she doesn't want to ruin the future. She get's sorted in Ravenclaw and is friends with Barry Crouch jr. and Regulus Black. She doesn't arrack attention until Sirius Black realises she exists and starts to ask her out (kind of a James/Lily situation). I think she and Lily have a fight.


** Oh I know this fic. I started it ages ago but grew tired of it. I have no recollection of the name. But Hermione also tutors James Potter (which is how Sirius and James realize she exists).

**** No problem! I took me a bit (and re-reading the summary just before reading this comment) to remember this one was a twin story. In my head there was a year difference (they aren't very sisterly in it), but oh well. Now I'm going to go read the one you were actually looking for because it sounds pretty good!

  The war was lost and the Order eradicated - all except one. The one that Voldemort really should have killed first. Hermione Granger rips apart space and time to make the impossible happen. January 30 1960, Lily Evans enters the world and so does her twin sister, Hermione. Marauders Era. EWE. Sirimione.

  James Potter went five years at Hogwarts without realizing Lily had a little sister. Hermione would have preferred if he never realized she existed. Now she's stuck, in Potter's circle of awareness, and maintaining the timeline. Not like he makes it easy, or something.
