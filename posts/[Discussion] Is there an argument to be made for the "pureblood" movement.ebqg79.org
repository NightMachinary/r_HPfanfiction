I'm currently trying to write a DaphnexHarry fanfiction, and I'm coming up to the scene where I'm going to pitch, (in my story), their ideologies against each other. Daphne believes that they should continue to keep magic from muggles, and slowly push out muggleborns from the society because they cannot be trusted vs Harry who thinks that muggleborns should be allowed into the community, and they should slowly integrate muggle technology into the Magical World and vice versa.

Now, I've read a couple of different perspectives for why the Pureblood movement, or rather the non-muggleborn movement if that's what you want to call it, actually has some value (btw this is totally AU/non-canon ideology).

1) Liberal Purebloods believe that Muggles are destructive in nature, multiple wars have proven that when handed tremendous power instead of using it for good, they immediately think 'how can I use this to my advantage'. Therefore, if shown magic, they would most likely destroy the world.

2) Magic in some fanfictions is thought to be an expression of the soul, that if you don't have magic it's because you reject the premise that some things are simply 'out-of-your-control' or 'magical'. This isn't exactly a selling point for me, simply because it doesn't give a clear guideline on how one 'believes' but has a very .. persuasive tone that's interesting.

3) Finally, this one has a more darker tone - that magic is for 'alpha's', or people born with power. That they are molded, from /God, Death, Diety, whatever/ to be what they are - and that is passed down from bloodline to bloodline, so if someone were to not be of magical blood and they have magic it's thought that they somehow stole it and do not belong in the community. Usually, this is supported with some bullshit about how Purebloods are capable of amazing magic, i.e. Dumbledore, Bellatrix, etc. I understand where it's trying to go with that idea, but doesn't hold true value for me..

So, anyways let me know what you think. If there's some argument for the movement that you know about, discovered, stumbled across, etc. share it - no matter how bigoted it may seem.

But let's keep this non-real world political, I understand it has a radical, bigoted undertone but lets focus on HP world :)


** Reasons to keep out muggleborns:

1) They, muggleborn, are foreigners who keep pushing their culture onto the existing one claiming their is better.

2) Purebloods have more in common with other purebloods around the world than muggleborn from their own country.

3) Why should the purebloods change? If the muggleborn don't like it move and start your own country. Further on this, they are a few centuries behind, Colonialism was absolutely still a thing. So go forth and bother someone else.

4) Magic is a gift not to be squandered, it must be treated with respect as it is alive, and muggleborn treat it like it's just some unknown fancy science.

I could maybe hammer out a few more but those seem to fit the style you seem to be looking for. Culture, Incompatibility, Forced Integration when Alternatives exist, and Magic Religous slant. Hope they help!

** As presented in canon by JK Rowling, blood prejudice is plain, unadorned bigotry. It's possible that she chose not to explain any pureblood arguments in order to make it clear that their bigoty is unbiased, or it could be for another reason.

In fanfiction, where options can be explored I think it is better to maintain that pureblood bigotry is still bigotry and is rooted in ignorance at best and blind hatred at worst. Reasons and explanations should be superfluous or overcomable, but blown out of proportion by bigotry.

My favorite examples for "moral high ground" pureblood ideology.

- They don't have anything against mudbloods as a concept, but they don't trust muggles because muggles are violent towards things they don't understand. Obscuri, Harry, and other abused children are eveidence that muggles shouldn't raise magical children. Efforts to establish policies that remove muggleborn from their parents are rejected as horrible and inhumane. Pureblood efforts are villified, which raises contention as purebloods consider leaving any magical child in the care of muggles to be cruel and unfeeling. Muggleborn adults get caught up in this fight as they defend their parents and families and continue to fight against this, building up a general feeling of resentment for muggleborn.

- Muggleborn are like immigrants in the eyes of Purebloods, they are leaving the muggle world to join the magical world without making any effort to learn the culture, the quirks of the language, or anything. Something they consider highly rude. Muggleborn demand political concessions and revolutionary changes without understanding what they are asking for or why things are the way they are. They also don't like the idea of muggleborn's habits of maintaining "dual citizenship" and think that they should abandon the muggle world.

- Muggleborn children are the biggest threat to the statute of secrecy. They are immersed in the magical world for most of the year and then thrown back into the muggle one every summer with all the filters of a preteen/teen.

- They are afraid of muggles, their technology, and their capacity for warfare, both on a weaponry and manpower basis. Every muggleborn is a risk that they will reject the statute of secrecy and try to tell the muggle world about magic in a way that can't be fixed. Unprecedented chaos is expected.

These ideas work well as pureblood "talking points." Concepts that more well educated pureblood supremists might believe and feel strongly about as justification for their learned bigotry growing up around other pureblood supremesists. Blurbs that more heavily bigoted people will drop without ever thinking about them as proof that their bigotry is right. The best way to work it in my mind is that for any kernel of truth a pureblood talking point has, it contributes to a general sense of bigotry that is more than the sum of any arguments for the pureblood movement.

** 1. Wizards have just as many wars as muggles. The pureblood movement is the specific cause of the last two wars. Wizards are just as bad as muggles as far as abusing power. I think it would be a pretty hard sell for Harry to agree that muggles are war mongers hungry for power when a Wizard obsessed with power killed his parents and was on another killing spree presently.
2. This doesn't make sense based on your premise that Daphne wants to push out muggleborns. If magic is an expression of your soul muggleborns with magic would have that same presence in their soul. This logic would be the argument FOR muggleborns to be more included in wizarding society, not less.
3. Without any proof of such a thing this is nothing a reasoned, logical person could accept. I can see Harry walking out of the room as soon as this idea was posited.

Honestly, unless you make Harry very OOC I can't see any scenario where he would be romantically involved with anyone who want to push out muggleborn. His mother was a muggleborn. His best friend is a muggleborn. As soon as Daphne told Harry "muggleborns couldn't be trusted" Harry would nope out immediately. It would be plausible if she was simply arguing that Wizarding society should continue to be kepts separate from Muggle society but pushing out muggleborns would be tough to pull off.

*** Harry liking a pureblood with different ideology is the whole reason I posed this question. I wanna write a flawed relationship built on stepping outside their comfort zones. Honestly, canon's post DH ending is rather boring; I wanna see what the two arguments that is subtly hinted at in the HP universe looks like between two people falling for each other.

Grindelwald and Dumbledore fought against each other with the exact same idealogies; and yet were canon lovers. So.. is it that far of a stretch for a muggle-raised wizard with pureblood family ties to try to understand the pureblood ideology, without disrespecting his muggleborn friend?

**** I totally get the intent...I just don't know how you can have an in character Harry falling for someone who thinks his mother and best friend shouldn't have been allowed in Hogwarts. Different ideologies is one thing...what you are proposing would be two people on entire opposite ends of the spectrum. It would be tantamount to someone's best friend being black and then dating someone in the KKK. I'm not sure the best friend would buy that you are just trying to understand the white supremacist ideology.

If you are going for a somewhat in character Harry than your Grindelwald/Dumbledore analogy doesn't work. Dumbledore as a young man was seduced by glory and power...that was a big reason he was attracted to Grindelwald. Canon Harry wants nothing to do with those things. Besides, Grindelwald and Dumbledore's differing philosophical ideologies are what drove them apart.

If the pureblood ideology is about being separate from muggles and thinking muggleborns should respect and integrate into wizarding tradition I could see it working.

**** I think you'd have to have them build-up a strong relationship first before Harry discoverd her opinions (so he doesn't immediately reject her), and then have her soften to his perspective. Because I don't think the ideology is defensible, and certainly not for Harry.

** I'd go with historical reasons. Witches and wizards were burned by muggles before they went into hiding. That'd be a pretty good reason for me to want to keep it a secret. Humans fear what they don't know and I wouldn't be too surprised if we started burning witches and wizards again. There's also a cultural aspect of muggle borns not knowing (and not caring to learn) about wizarding traditions. They often try to force their muggle views into this new world without understanding this world first. House elves might really be slaves, but they might just as well really be a magical race that gets their powers from servitude and values serving others above anything else (just like it might seem weird to Americans how non confrontational many Asian countries are as there's a difference in values - personal freedom vs community).

** If you're obsessed with heritability of magic you could have some pseudo-science of tracking and combining family lines to produce powerful wizards. Muggleborns could legitimately upset such schemes due to their lack of magical history and their status as wild cards could disincentivize marrying them.

The cultural tensions between Wizarding and Muggle raised people living in the same society are notable, as is mentioned above, but furthermore the Magical Economy would likely be tilted in favor of Purebloods and Half-Bloods who have been there for generations and control crucial assets and magical resources. Muggleborns would be overwhelmingly poorer immigrants who would have difficulty acculturating and assimilating and could resent the people in power- the same people who lean towards blood supremacy.

The split loyalty of Muggleborns between the two worlds is a noteworthy reason. Wizards are not underground for the Muggle's benefit- Muggles were and are an existential threat to them. The potential breach to the Statute of Secrecy a rogue or careless Muggleborn could cause is massive, and even cooperative Muggleborns raise the risk of exposure by living in close proximity to their Muggle families and communities.

Also, as Wizards live longer lives than Muggles and have longer memories, there could be a lot of distaste towards all things Muggle as a result of the witch-burnings that killed many of their brethren, disproportionately their children. Note that Hogwarts is a hidden, magically defended castle- castle's are defensive military structures. Putting all the magic using kids there and then hiding it BEFORE THE STATUTE OF SECRECY should illustrate how serious of a problem that was. (I don't know if it's obscure canon or fanon but I've heard it said that Slytherin's objection to Muggleborn students was that they might lead their muggle families and armies right to Hogwarts and help destroy it because of their own religious or personal convictions against witchcraft. If it's not canon it should be- I love it).

** There's also the belief that they wouldn't contribute anything to society. Or be able to bring anything into marriages.

​

Besides the blood bigots, I would wager that quite a few Traditional Pureblood families would fight among themselves if a muggleborn/half-blood was an up and coming potion master/spellcrafter/warder/etc with a boatload of inventions under their belt and tons of potential for more.

​

In Larceny, Lechery, and Luna Lovegood!, Narcissa saw Hermione's jinxed contract, found out they were spells she invented and called their marriage a "proper pureblood marriage". Of course, in that fic, family magic and spells were everything. Potters were good for warding, Weasleys were good for fertility magic, Fudge was good for sewage systems, Malfoy for hair tonics and getting out of contracts, and Luna's Grandmother's family was good for soul flaying magic.

​

In He's Not Dead Yet, there's family magic, where if a family does a trade for so long, it becomes "in their blood" and future decedents are born with an affinity for it. Sometimes it skips generations because of different families marrying into others and whatnot. One generation could get the MAIN family magic, and the next could get something from a family that joined in generations ago.

** There's that thing that happened in Wizarding America. A dumb as a stump witch fell for a Magic hating Muggle. He took her wand and came close to exposing Magic to the world in the late 1800s. Pottermore/Wizarding World goes more indepth about it.

I read a fanfic about Daphne being forced into a contract with Harry at birth and him trying to get to understand her and her side, see what the other is like before wands have to be drawn, to paraphrase the fic. Called Contractual Invalidation. Maybe that can give you some inspiration.

** Magical ability should have its own selection pressure on the human genome. Muggleborns and halfbloods are usually very dangerous, erratic, combustive individuals, that aren't adapted to long term exposure to magic. And hey, look at Dumbledore, Riddle, Potter, Granger, all these reckless people causing mayhem. Better to be a well-bred individual of known provenance, sane, avoiding deadly novelty.
