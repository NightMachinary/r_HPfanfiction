** It's pretty rough, I'd suggest going back over the fic and correcting it. There's plenty of missing words, grammar errors, and other minor writing errors. Subjectively I really dislike some of the tropes used (manipulative Dumbledore, super Hermione, mates for werewolves, twin speak, seer lovegoods, magical backwater England etc.) and I really think you should tone down Hermione's backstory. I also think some of the characterization is off - Sirius not trusting Dumbledore without any stated reason is really weird as is the Malfoy situation- and really should be explained better. I do think that your writing has potential and like your creativity, please don't let the criticism make you stop writing. Overall not bad for a first attempt, good luck!
