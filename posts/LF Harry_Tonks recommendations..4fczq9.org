with the exception of (The summer of change)[[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2567419/1/Harry-Potter-And-The-Summer-Of-Change]]], recommend me good fics featuring the "Honks" pairing. preferably romance-centric fics that are a bit to the mature side but all recommendations are welcomed. Harem/Multi fics are also welcomed if Tonks is featured quite heavily on the relationship.

AUs are welcome provided they aren't time-travel fics. no soul-bonds(a trope i hope isn't persistent in this pairing) please. Completed fics are greatly appreciated.


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Halfblood Auror) is the best, hands down.

/HOWEVER/, it's abandoned. Just to warn you.

  In his quest to stop Malfoy in his sixth year, Harry turns to an old friend for help. Along the way he finds new allies, a Horcrux, & someone to stand by his side. Alternate view of HBP. Rating for language & violence.

** The first "Honks" (i hate that name... makes me think of a goose) story I ever read was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6740130/1/The-Rebel-and-The-Chosen][The Rebel and The Chosen]]. Its pretty good, mostly a canon rehash but with Harry and Tonks falling for each other and some things changing. Its by the same author as Harry Potter and the Half Blood Auror which is what most consider the best Honks fic out there though it is abandonned. Also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11160991/1/0800-Rent-A-Hero][0800-Rent-A-Hero]] seems like it will end up Harry/Tonks.

*Note:* I'm linking the fics directly because the bot seems to be down.

** Haven't read this in a long time, so it probably hasn't aged well, but linkffn(Anyone you want by strider)

There's also a fem!harry/Tonks fic that is supposed to be good, can't recall the name

**** Might also be linkffn(Holly Evans and the Spiral Path), which features a bunch of fem!Harry/Hermoine but eventually ends up fem!Harry/Tonks.

I quite liked it but I can certainly see why some might not, it does get pretty dark and disturbing at times.

  Holly is prickly and poisonous like her namesake, only with Hermione she's more normal. Dark and disturbing Girl!Harry tells her story via an enchanted journal.

** You can try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9720211/1/The-Merging][The Merging by Shaydrall]].

The final pairing isn't decided yet and it doesn't seem to be going Harry/Multi. But Honks is definitely a thing.

  Having vanished from his home life at a young age Harry Potter has been declared dead. On a field assignment for her training Tonks finds a unusual partner and friend while in the field and maybe a even someone more. Honks fic with maybe a few other pairings in the background but mainly Harry and Tonks. Enjoy and leave Reviews.
