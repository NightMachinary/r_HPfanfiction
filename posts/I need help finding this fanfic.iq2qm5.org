It was a fanfiction about Harry Potter and Voldemort's duel in the forbidden forest, but instead of dying, he somehow time travels to the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. He tries to sacrifice himself for Sirius, gets sent to the veil but he gets out alive with the help of his parents but people think that he's still dead. So he's alive and he needs to get rid of the horcruxes.

It was definitely not on Wattpad, but I don't remember if it was Archive of our Own or Fanfiction.net

Can you guys help me please? I've been trying to find this fic again for so long

#+begin_quote
  What if instead of dying, the Killing Curse sends Harry two years into the past into the Department of Mysteries? Will Harry be able to save those who died for him and destroy all the Horcruxes without Voldemort knowing or will he end up dead himself?
