I know there's probably a bunch out there and I've been wating to find a good one. The longer the better. Mature rating preferred but not needed. Thanks!


** linkffn(Forgetting the Tears by D'autrefois) and linkffn(Between the Lines by Tinsadisaster) should be exactly what you are looking for.

I'm not sure, but I think one of Potato19's fics focuses on that as well (as a side note, if you are in the look for H/Hr, Potato has a pletora of very good, fluffy fics about them).

  What will our two hopeless lovebirds do when there's nothing holding them back but themselves? Secrets will be revealed and true pasts will come to light as they hunt for the meaning behind the Tales of Beedle the Bard and Dumbledore's mysterious clues. Will they be able to keep it together while everything around them is falling apart? A story of love, war, and broken hearts.

  War changes everyone: Harry resolves to face destiny and struggles to reconcile with Dumbledore's past, fully aware of the price he must pay for victory. Hermione walks through fire, determined to share in Harry's burden. Ron battles resurgent jealousy and soon discovers he may lose far more than he stood to gain. One thing is certain; peace is never cheaply purchased. H/Hr
