** Anything specific you were looking for? In canon, Harry's disliked by the Dursleys for being magical, half the school for losing 150 points in a night, half the school for potentially being the Heir of Slytherin, half the school for being in the Triwizard Tournament, half of magical Britain due to the Ministry's smear campaign, and especially the Death Eaters for being Voldemort's number one target.

Granted, most of these are transient, but still, with how fickle and vengeful and aggressive the magical world seems to be, it's a wonder Harry was able to muster up enough love for them to do that self-sacrifice thing.

So, what specifically were you after? Fics where Harry's hated for something he did do, fics where he's a scapegoat/propaganda victim, fics where Ron & Hermione are card-carrying jerks and Harry finds solace with an OC, fics where Harry gets rich and everyone who previously hated him are trying and failing to get into his good graces...?

*** Honestly anything like those is good, as long as it is a good fic, in your opinion. I have way too much time on my hands, so I should be able to read a lot. I'm just looking for a good fic where Harry doesn't really have anyone to turn to. But also bonus if people are trying to get back into his good graces and failing. Thanks.

** linkffn(No Knowledge, No Money, No Aim) The Dursleys kicked him out the minute he got his Hogwarts letter, the wand he found was less than useless, and everyone thinks he's a squib until he single-handedly incapacitates most of the school. His only real friends are Hagrid and Tom the Barman.

  In a world where Neville Longbottom was marked as Voldemorts equal, Harry Potter is determined not to be his Inferior, and that leaves only one option... Not Slash.
