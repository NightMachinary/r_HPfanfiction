I think the character of Draco Malfoy is fascinating. I find fanon's version of him to be less so. I've read linkffn(6432055) and consider it to essentially be the gold standard of what I'm looking for. NO DRAMOINE OR DRARRY, please. That is not what I'm looking for.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

#+begin_quote
  The trials for suspected Death Eaters involved in the Wizarding Wars have begun, and Draco Malfoy finds himself trying to hold together what is left of his family and his fortune, while struggling to escape the looming, almost inevitable future of a lifetime spent in Azkaban. But there is one person who might not have given up completely.

** I'm writing a story centered around Draco and I'm trying my best to be as accurate to his canon personality as possible.

Do you mind if I message you with the link after I put out the first chapter? If I put it out, that is. I'm fairly busy and I've never written a fanfic before.

** This is very long, but it has a sympathetic Draco who starts off very canon but sort of evolves into an interesting side character. Warning: Its basically a year 4 rewrite stretched into like 5 books worth of text, that focuses heavily on the politics. Heck, the GOF doesn't even kick in til almost half way. But still, I kinda like it. linkffn(8045114)
