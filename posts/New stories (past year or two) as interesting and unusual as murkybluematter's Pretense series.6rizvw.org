In regards to sheer quality, murkybluematter is very difficult to match so that's not a primary criterion.

Just looking for stuff that is 'different'. By which I mean that it has

- An unusual/unique and competently executed premise
- A good take on an old but rare trope
- Something this you find as different and unusual.

I've liked all the aforementioned author's stories. In addition to that, I've read the spinoff, The Rigel Black Chronicles, which is quite interesting as well, but in a different way. Any suggestions?


** link to the spinoff?

** Linkffn(Alexandra quick and the Thorn circle) is a very, very popular, isn't au, but (as it's set in America and populated entirely by OC's) is about as far from the hpverse as it's possible to get. There are four of them; I will give you a heads-up that the first book is a little rough around the edges. Alex can be a difficult character to like, but the second, third and fourth fics are among the most beloved in fanfiction.

Also, since you'll get these anyway, linkffn(dodging prison and stealing witches by leadvone) and linkffn(Harry Potter and the prince of Slytherin by the sinister man) are both au, detailed, grey! Harry stories that you'll probably like.

**** It's a time-travel re-do fic.

It's a smart, dark Harry fic.

It's a harem fic.

I've read a fair number of those.

But I've never read a version of this fic with competent antagonists - Dumbledore, John and Tom are all foils that actually thwart Harry and co.

I also really love the Granger engineering company that comes up later, and the clever things the posse does.

I can totally understand not liking the fic. The doe-eyed adoration of Harry can be a little wearing, and right at the beginning there's not a lot of opposition. But I still quite like it.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

Both are quality takes on old cliches, and are additionally quite lengthy and slow paced.

I don't recommend Alexandra Quick. Excellent grammar, good concept, but terribly executed. The author's writing, the plot, and the character just don't suck me in.
