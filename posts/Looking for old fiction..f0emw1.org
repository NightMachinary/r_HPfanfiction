Pretty sure it was completed, harry and the sorting hat end up in the middle of the wilderness (might have been Albania, eastern Europe definitely) and harry has to survive. I think the hat had to teach him to recast the enchantments on the Ford Anglia to get home? Might be mixing stories. If anyone remembers this let me know please. Link would be fantastic.

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.
