** When will you be taking down the plagiarized art on AO3? Now that your plagiarism has been exposed and it's been taken off Harmony FB and Reddit it seems like the right thing to do.

*** pursuit provided proof that he didn't plagarize :) the proof can be found in a pinned channel on happy harmony homestead discord :) or if you'd prefer to talk to me directly, just send me a DM on reddit or discord and I'd be happy to sort things out.

**** If it's convenient enough to DM the proof I'd appreciate it. Not really interested in joining the discord.

****** What did I do? I saw it on Facebook earlier and didn't come anywhere near your server. Plagiarism pisses me off and the evidence I've seen so far looks pretty damning. Jak offered to send proof because I wanted to see your side. Am I missing something?

******** No, because it was taken off Facebook and Reddit I assumed it. They clearly took a look, assessed it and saw there was a problem. How did I shit on your Discord? Who are these followers of mine? If I had followers why would they care about this?

I'm so confused right now because Jak and I had a respectful back and forth. Seriously you are acting like someone who is guilty.

********** There is a big post on Facebook showing them side by side. They wouldn't just do it for no reason. As I said the side by side comparison looks damning to me but Jak said you had proof and I wanted to see both sides. What is this obsession with the Discords?

** I noticed a lack of Ron in the description. Is the in-universe explanation for this that the golden trio is just too different in this AU, or does it contain Ron!Bashing. No judgment, either way, bashing fics can be fun and Ron is a horribly difficult character to write.

*** Of course not, no bashing, just a reasonable explanation of Hermione's unreasonable anger in sixth year. All my characters will stay in character, and the beginning of the story, if you do read it, is canon actually, it just deviates from there.
