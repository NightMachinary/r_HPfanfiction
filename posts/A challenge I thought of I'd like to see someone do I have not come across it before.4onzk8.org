It's a harry potter and percy Jackson verse crossover Dark evil harry or or grey harry

Grey harry would be him just doing what is destined to happen anyway not because of totally evil but he also would have his own reasons for helping surt)

Begins in 4th year and at the before the last Olympian

Harry is either a child of surt or willing is possessed by surt (surt is the Lord of the fire giants he is destined to kill Frey the God of summer and destroy the world and asgard in a inferno

So harry would have absolute command over fire and be immune to it

Ragnarok must happen like in the myth the 3 year long winter the freeing of the giant wolf fenrir the crowing of the roosters the battle if you want to include the Norse gods go ahead if not just use the Olympians even minor gods

Ragnarok must effect the wizarding world

Runes are still a big thing in the wizard world

Manipulative Dumbledore

Wizards and demigod s know about each other or at least they have myths of each other

Harry must compete in the tournament

Harry must go to camp half blood

Harry and voldemort as enemies

Their is a prophecy about ragnarok

Optional

The demigods come to Hogwarts

The demigods compete in the tournament

Some wizards are demigods

The Olympians and titans giant's etc think ragnarok is a myth

Heroes of Olympus still happens

Ragnarok can be stopped/it's effects weakened

Forbidden

Slash Parrings if any are up to you Really hope someone takes up this challenge


** Every time I read one of these "challenges" and I come across the word "must," I immediately go "well fuck you, too, pal."

I may or may not grasp the point of "challenges."

** The best prompts are original (at the time) new ideas which can be made into a single sentence or statement, for example: "Severus Snape is Harry's father", "Harry Potter becomes Naruto's genie". What you have here is a bunch of unoriginal ideas put together into a 'plot' which tries to force writers onto narrow story lines.

I've never seen a 'Challenge' like this answered well. Most challengers ignore most of the points /anyway/. If you like a set of plot points like this, write it yourself.
