HOLY COW. Im new to the sub, wandered a few weeks back in looking for recs, but somehow haven't started HP&tPoS til today. I love EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU who have recommended it- Slytherin!Harry stories are my fave but it's hard to find decent ones, and this is so, so good. Thank you!!!

*** Ha, thanks, Im subscribed to that one. I like it pretty well, but harem fics just aren't my thing, though WBWL is incredibly fun when it's not full of caricatures.

**** I just thought it was fun and a bit Prince of Slytherin-esque.

Maybe try linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) as well.

***** And, actually, I feel really bad for being snippy at you, Im REALLY enjoying "Dodging Prison" a LOT, it's a great rec, I just wish it weren't a harem fic cause even SuperHarry is still just one guy.

*** Chapter 50 now. I liked it a bit for the first 15-ish, then gradually realized I was hiss-cackling in joy (gotta be discreet, I was supposedly at work) at the end of every chapter. Now, at home, I can devour it, and am DYING, it's so much fun.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
