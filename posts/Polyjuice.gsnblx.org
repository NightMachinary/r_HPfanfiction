What would happen if you took a hair from someone who was polyjuiced as someone else and then added it to a polyjuice potion.

Would it be their non polyjuiced self?

Would it be the person they were polyjuiced as?

Would it depend on if the person was still polyjuiced when you added it to your polyjuice?

What if you collected a hair of someone then they took polyjuice (would the hair you took change color/length)


** On a similar note, what happens if someone under an imperius is put under another imperius with conflicting orders?

If the first imperius wins, then you could make yourself temporarily immune by having a friend imperius you with "behave normal, as if there was no imperius on you".

If the second one wins then you could stop an existing imperius by adding another one.

** It's an interesting question. On the simpler aspects I believe the potion changes you at the cellular level. So if you (C) pluck the hair from a person (A) who had polyjuiced themselves to be person (B) and then used that hair in your own polyjuice potion that you (C) drank I believe you would turn into person (B).

Now I don't think it matters whether Person (A) is still polyjuiced as person (B) when you (C) take the potion though I do think there is a time limit. For instance, if you (C) pluck the hair from person (A) 2 minutes before his transformation as person (B) ends, but aren't able to immediately use the hair until after person (A) transformation ends, I believe that hair will still cause you (C) to transform into person (B).

Now the one time limit is whatever exists in terms of how long a hair etc can still be "viable" for use in a polyjuice potion after it is harvested. We know this time limit exists because Barty jr. kept Moody alive and close in order to have access to his hair for use with the potion. If this time limit didn't exist then he could have shaved Moody's head to get all the hair he needed and killed him. But instead he had to keep him alive.

(Not sure if the next bit is from canon or fanon). I seem to remember a discussion that the person had to be alive when you took the hair or the polyjuice potion wouldn't work. If this is true (and i believe it is) it gives support to why Barty jr. kept moody alive. I also remember a discussion that if a person dies while under polyjuice they remain in that polyjuiced form. This is proven in canon by barty jr.'s mother who died in Azkaban polyjuiced as him and never reverted.

The last question that was broached was if you took a hair from person (A) and after you harvested the hair person (A) took polyjuice to transform to person (B) would the hair you harvested transform to person (B) hair eg turn long and blonde. I would say no as the hair was no longer attached to a living being and therefore was not there to be affected by the polyjuice potion.

So looking at all of the previous points. That a hair has to be acquired from a living person. That there is a finite timeframe that a harvested hair is viable for use with the potion. And that a person who dies while polyjuiced remains in that transformed state. We have to ask the question of would the hair taken from person (A) while they are polyjuiced as person (B) transform back to person (A) hair when the polyjuice wears off.

My thought is no. Mainly because I believe your own magic is what assists you to revert back to your own form. And the reason that a person who dies while polyjuiced doesn't revert when the polyjuice timeframe ends is because the magic is gone from their body and is no longer there to assist.

So I believe that a hair from a polyjuiced person will not revert to the original so that it doesn't matter if the timeframe for the oerson who was polyjuiced has expired as long as that harvested polyjuiced hair does not surpass the timeframe that a hair is viable after being harvested.

Which means that a polyjuiced hair will turn you into that polyjuiced person rather than the person who first drank the potion.

Good set of questions.

** Reminds me of a story centered around polyjuice transformations that I love.

The idea in that story is that if Harry uses polyjuice to turn into Hermione, and then instantly uses another batch to polyjuice into himself again, when the hour timelimit is up, he turns back into Hermione because the potion/magic believes that to be his base form now.

** Either it won't work at all, or you get the person who was changed from. Polyjuice changes just appearance not the substance. In the situation of CoS, when you get the hair from fake Crabbe (which was in reality Ron), you would change into Ron. If the fake Bellatrix Lestrange in DH (who was in fact Hermione) made love and got pregnant, it would be Hermione carrying the baby.
