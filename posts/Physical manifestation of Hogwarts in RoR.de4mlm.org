Like the post title, she appears only in the RoR, Harry stumbles upon her, they fall in love, y'all know the drill. I think she has limited powers too, until Harry destroys something in Dumbledore's office that limits her power.

** I've seen a fic like this, but their relationship was purely platonic.

I don't really remember what else happened in the fic, though, so I can't help you. Sorry.
