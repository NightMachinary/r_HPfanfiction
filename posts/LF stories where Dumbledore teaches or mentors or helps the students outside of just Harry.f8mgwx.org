Maybe he helps hide the Slytherins who don't want to fight with or against Voldemort, maybe he helps with Occlumency, maybe with healing or anything else.

Harry can be involved, but I'd like to see Dumbledore help Ron and Hermione, maybe Neville and Luna or other characters too.

Just more involved than in the "For the Greater Good" "Twirl evil beard" kind of person.

Don't want the characters too OP, Harry or other characters smarter or more powerful than in canon is fine, but make it believable.

Absolutely NO Ron Weasley Bashing. I'm fine with Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione if there's NO Weasley bashing.

No Lord Potter or Harem Harry

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Anyone can be the main character

Can be on ANY site.

The Horcruxes can be a thing or not.

Would rather it be completed, but if not, that's fine.


** Well... I can make a chapter all about that in my fic, since I'm planning on giving him more screentime anyway, and that sounds like a neat prompt. He's (probably) already dead, but his portrait can help Snape or Ginny or something like that. No bashing of any kind.
