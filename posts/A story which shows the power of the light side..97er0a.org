In every dark!Harry story we seem to have at least two recurring themes.

1. Dark magic is powerful, but not necessarily evil.
2. The light side is weak for attempting to NOT kill their enemies, forcing them to always lose to the dark side for never “learning the lesson”.

The problem with these two themes is that they're almost always accompanied by a third:

1. The light side are the real bad guys for suppressing/forcing the dark side to change.

But how can this be? If dark magic is superior to light magic, the dark are willing to kill their enemies, and the dark typically are from older families with all the wealth... how the fuck does the light side always seem to have the upper hand?

Thus, does anyone have any stories that showcase why you don't fuck around with a light wizard? I want to see someone killing dementors with a patronus, defeating Voldemort by feeding him a love potion paired to Molly Weasley, and I wanna see Hermione forcing Draco Malfoy to commit suicide as the only means of escaping her lecture on the effects hair gel have on late stage balding.
