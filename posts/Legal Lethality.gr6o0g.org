"What do you mean, Voldemort never broke the law?"

"Well, ma'am, you see, he never technically cast any illegal spells, so from a purely legal standpoint, he's on the right side of the laws. The same can't be said for his followers, but the Dark Lord himself? All legal"

"But... he killed people! Decent witches and wizards! Aurors, hitwizards, shopowners, THE POTTERS!"

"And had he used a muggle weapon, like a spoon, or any of the unforgivables to do so he would be in Azkaban first thing in the morning. Fact is, he used a bloody Alohomora to unlock the capillaries in the Lady Potters heart and a Banisher and Freezing Charm on a goddamn DAFFODIL to stab the Lord Potter to death. Every single one of his kills was done with household charms! Killing isn't against the law, as long as the kill is HONOURABLE!"

"That is utter BULLSHIT, Shacklebolt!"

"I know, miss Granger, I know - but there's nothing we can do. Anyone attacking him with a mundane weapon is acting against the law, and I must sadly inform you that the Sword of Gryffindor is still a sword and as such considered an enchanted muggle artifact by the law. As such, the sword will be confiscated and handed to the proper authorities while mister Potters case is ongoing. There's nothing I can do... at least, seeing as it is a historical artifact, it will be handed to the head of the appropriate department..."

"Oh, so madam Bones will be taking care of it?

"No, Hermione - Arthur will"

**** Not much difference from the canon ministry, where the minister can give the death sentence without trial (BC jr) or imprison people "because they must be seen to be doing something"

If anything, it just explains a bit of the ministrys incompetence tbh, they're useless in canon.

***** Ergh. That's my main issue with canon towards the end. Rowling tried to slyly make it political, but also couldn't make it too complex or serious because that would put people off, and it ended up just... /wrong/. Like if you put aside your love for the series and look at the period from end of GoF till like mid DH, it has a pretty ugly "government bad" vibe.

******* Eh. My thoughts about CC can roughly be summed up as "It should be fucking burned, but I can use Delphini as a character." The only positive thing that came out of it was the fact that we received Voldemort's daughter as a named canon character, technically with more canon presence then Daphne Greengrass, Tracey Davis and Susan Bones combined. Not that anyone has actually read the script of CC, but still.

I've been toying around with putting her in fics, born anywhere between 1945-1980. Some pretty nice plots have come out of it, if only I had an attention span of over 10k words.

"Oh, no reason. By the way, did you know that a fever of over 42 degrees causes convulsions and death?"

** That would be a great showcase for magic munchkin!Tom Riddle, who goes out of his way to combine magic with muggle scientific findings and showing his followers how to do the same, much to their initial disdain and eventual glee.

A setting where the vast majority of death eater kills are made 100% legal through applied creativity is also one where they have got to be made legitimately terrifying through said creativity alone.

The above goes double for Voldemort.

"My lord, how are you so accurate?"

"I put one of my horcruxes in a muggle targeting computer in the 1970's. Initially, it was because who in their right mind would think to look for a horcrux of mine in an MOD bunker? Now, I just legilimens it to share targeting data with me and my computer self gives me the exact sequence of movements I need to keep an opponent in my sights before I can finish blinking."

"Amazing, my lord!"

"Well, compared to the usual tripe about ICBM ballistics properties and potential intercept vectors on exo-atmospheric operations my other self has to deal with, running some arithmantic operations to divine how and where to position yourself at minimum risk for maximum reward seems to be a welcome distraction."

"Amazing! Now say, I have some questions about the bubblehead charm..."

"Yes?"

"Can you cast it so that it manifests inside someone's airways without touching the lungs?"

"Ahh, the old choke them to death with nobody noticing trick. Now, that requires a little bit of modification, since you have to both deliberately botch the spell /and/ cast it on another, a circumstance the charm was deliberately designed to prevent"...

And so on. Charmingly-Evil!Professor!Voldemort is best Voldemort in my opinion, and this whole idea needs one of those just to run properly.
