Okay, so I've read a lot of fics in which James Potter was the son of Charlus Potter and Dorea Black, who is the sister of Pollux and Cassiopeia.

While Draco is the son of Narcissa, granddaughter of Pollux through his younger son Cygnus. I'm attaching a family tree for reference, but I don't understand it in terms of inheritance.

If we assume that Harry is Dorea's grandson, who is closer to the Black Lordship out of the two of them? (I don't think it actually exists in canon, but just go with it please)

There's other factors to consider too, like Harry being Sirius's godson, but being disinherited. There's two possibilities here too, Walburga didn't actually disinherit him, just blew his head off the family tree (weird mother) and she didn't actually have a right to disinherit anyone from the family.

Or that she actually had a right and did it so Harry is now just Dorea Black's grandson and not the Godson of the heir.

Please? Thank you!

Edit: Forgot to insert the Family tree. [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/official-final-version-sm.png][Black Family]]


** Based on the family tree you used, it would be Draco. He's descended from the eldest son of Cygnus and Violetta. Harry is descended from their youngest daughter. So it doesn't matter that Draco is an extra generation further down the tree, his love would have to be exhausted before Harry's was brought into play.

All of this assumes the Black lordship would allow for female line inheritance. If it doesn't they're both screwed and no one on that tree inherits. But I think that's unlikely, the wizarding world seems fairly equal in terms of gender.

**** I should add a corollary. If there's a less common set of inheritance rules used, Harry could inherit. If it goes via every suitable member of each generation before proceeding down to the next level of the trees, Harry inherits before Draco I think.

Or if magic, maybe the title is enchanted to go to the most powerful person in the family. Or its like the goblet of fire and chooses the best new Lord via a set of criteria determined by the first Lord Black.

****** Arguably so could Harry. Given that we're up canon creek here, there's no set "level" of nobility for any of the families. The Potters could be rich merchants that got the youngest daughter of a cadet line of a noble house (in real world historical terms, thats a very realistic situation). The Malfoys could be high nobility that the Blacks were fortunate to be able to marry their daughter into. Or it could be the other way around. You can write it however you want.

A Lord that was already beholden to another would, because of those prior obligations, be unable to put family first and succesfully defend its interests. As a result, they would be an inferior choice.

****** Yeah, it would come down to whether bastard children or magical offspring of squibs can inherit. Just because Alphard never married doesn't mean he didn't sprog up. Could be an interesting way to introduce an original character to a fic, or make a background character more relevant! And as for squib born children...I personally could see loopholes existing that allow the magic offspring of squibs to be brought back into the family discretely when there's a lack of heirs. As long as they have magic, I think prudence would result in their heritage being overlooked rather than the family dying. Obviously more extreme blood purists wouldn't overlook things, but mainstream blood purists probably would.

*** I think they would go with British system, and thus females coudln't inherit. The reason for this is that they are still British citizen and if they had nobility titles, these would have come from the British monarch (before or after statue of secrecy), as other wise they coudln't be nobility. (they wouldn't be screwed just needed to wait untill all other lines die out and theirs is only one left)

In this case, Sirius as last direct male line, would have the title, when he dies, it would be abeyand untill either only one of the lines of Harry's, Draco's and Tonk's would die out, as they all decent from female members of house of Black, in which case, after only one of their line continues (like say Harry doesn't have any decendands anymore and Tonk's wouldn't have any any more, be they great great great grandsons or further down the line), and Dracos's continues, then Draco's oldest male decendand could inherit the title, though this also would go through same thing, straight male line from Draco and the always the oldest. If there was a daughter and line only continue through her, it would do same thing with her decendants as it did with Harry, Tonks and Draco, untill she only had one line left and then once more the oldest sons could inherit.

**** Women absolutely can inherit titles in the British nobility, it's just that up until recently it was rare, because they had to have no brothers. But how do you think Queen Mary I & II, Queen Elizabeth I & II and Victoria got the throne?

And to prove this isn't just an exception for the monarchy, this page shows tons of women becoming baronesses, countesses, duchesses etc. [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_peerages_inherited_by_women]]

Looking at the Black family tree, Sirius may be disinherited as he's been blasted off the tree, but since the whole idea of "Lordships" is a fanon thing you can decide that either way.

+If Sirius is disinherited, then upon the death of his father, Orion, in 1979, the lordship would move to his sister, Lucretia, the new lady, and to her son's with Ignatius Prewett, if she had any.+

EDIT: Complete list of people in line, because I'm bored and also I missed out on Arcturus being alive.

House of Black as of 1991

Lord: Arcturus Black (d. 1991)

Line of Succession 1. Lucretia Prewett nee Black (d. 1992) 2. Cyngus Black (d. 1992) 3. Bellatrix Lestrange nee Black 4. Narcissa Malfoy nee Black 5. Draco Malfoy 6. Cassiopia Black (d. 1992) 7.

Any issue of the above 22. 1st Daughter of Caspar Crouch and Charis Crouch nee Black 23. Any issue of the above 24. 2nd Daughter of Caspar Crouch and Charis Crouch nee Black 25. Any issue of the above

And if we put back in anyone who was removed from the tree, we get instead.

House of Black as of 1991

Lord: Arcturus Black (d. 1991)

Line of Succession 1. Sirius Black 2. Lucretia Prewett nee Black (d. 1992) 3. Phineas Black (probably dead by now) 4. Any issue of the above 5. Alphard Black (but I think he's dead) 6. Cyngus Black (d. 1992) 7. Bellatrix Lestrange nee Black 8. Andromeda Tonks nee Black 9. Nymphadora Tonks 10. Narcissa Malfoy nee Black 11. Draco Malfoy 12. Cassiopia Black (d. 1992) 13. Marius Black (possibly dead, also a squib) 14. Any issue of the above 15. Son of Charlus Potter and Dorea Pottter nee Black 16. Any issue of the above 17. 1st Son of Herbert Burke and Belvina Burke nee Black 18. Any issue of the above 19. 2nd Son of Herbert Burke and Belvina Burke nee Black 20. Any issue of the above 21.

Any issue of the above 43. Any issue of Bob Hitchens and Isla Hitchens nee Black

So, after Sirius' death, it goes Prewetts, old disinherited Black line, then Lestrange, then Tonks, then Malfoy, squib Black line, Potter, Burke, Longbottom, Wesaley, Crouch, then Hitchens.

If we take it from the moment of Sirius' death in 1996, and assume that Charlus + Dorea = James, and simplify it a lot because the one above is too long.

House of Black as of 1996

Lord: Sirius Black (d. 1996)

Line of Succession 1. Line of Phineas Black (disinherited) 2. Bellatrix Lestrange nee Black 3. Andromeda Tonks nee Black (disinherited) 4. Nymphadora Tonks (disinherited) 5. Narcissa Malfoy nee Black 6. Draco Malfoy 7. Line of Marius Black (disinherited, squib) 8. Harry Potter 9. Line of Belvina Burke nee Black 10. Callidora Longbottom nee Black 11. Line of Callidora Longbottom nee Black 12. Cedrella Weasley nee Black 13. Line of Cedrella Weasley nee Black 14. Line of Charis Crouch nee Black 15. Line of Isla Hitchens nee Black (disinherited)

Basically, if Phineas Black has kids, they probably get it, seeing as we already ignored Sirius being disinherited.

If we did ignore Sirius, that means Bellatrix is the Lady Black, God help us all.

After her death at Hogwarts, it would go to Narcissa, assuming we skip over the Tonks, else it would go to Andromeda and then Teddy.

So the final answer is neither Draco nor Harry, but, in fact, Teddy Lupin.

***** Damn, this is so interesting.

Now I realize canon and fanon has messed with my memory.

Never realized the Lord/Ladyship stuff was fanon and not canon.

So Sirus was officially disowned in canon, right? And not just blasted off the family tree?

Since Sirus had inherited 12 Grimmauld Place, I think I just assumed that he was blasted off the tree due to Walburga's temper tantrums and was not actually officially disowned like Andromeda was. Hence making him the Head of the Black family.

If I'm reading this right, if Sirus was disowned, and the Head of the family was determined by birth order (and not gender), then the Head of the family during the events of the series went:

- Bellatrix
- Narcissa
- Draco

Huh. So weird. Though I guess if you include Cursed Child (ew), Delphini is the current Head of House Black then...

****** I think Sirius was disowned by Walburga, but not by all members of the family. Alphard left money to him, for example. Given that Arcturus died in '91, when Sirius was still locked up accused of being a death eater, I can only assume that Arcturus wrote Sirius back into his will (if he ever wrote him out).

If inheritance is purely agnatic, then Draco won't be lord, because you can't inherit through the female line, we would have to back up another layer to look at Phineas Nigellus' cousins and follow them down.

And Bella>Cissy>Draco is still following Male-Preference inheritance (fancy name is agnatic-cognatic primogeniture), because all of Bella/Cissy's elder uncles and cousins are dead.

And if you want to look at Cursed Child (which I really don't), I don't think Delphini is Lady Black, seeing as she would be illegitimate. Bellatrix was married to Lestrange, not Voldemort, and bastards don't inherit.

******* Oh yeah, I didn't even think of Phineas Nigellus having cousins and how that could flip the whole inheritance thing, since Rowling (at least I think), hasn't given a full blown Black Family tree.

Wow, that adds a completely new layer if you go down that hole. Depending on who the male cousin (who would be the new heir) married, it opens up a lot of possibilities on who is actually the Head of the House.

It gives fanfic writers a lot to work with, IMO.

***** Some titles that have special exeption to the inheritance rule can be passed to women yes, but in general was talking about the normal cases, not the special ones, that are really small minority out of all nobilities in UK still existing that would allow females to inherit the titles.

This is why it's a huge problem in UK in current times, because lot of famlies that have their manor that goes with the title are run as a museum etc, but some of them have only females as children, but because they are unable to inherit the titles from their father, they will have to move out of their house and give up their business (which most often exists so they can have the house in good shape) when their father dies, as the property is transferred to their distant male relative who will inherit the title. This is why in UK lot of people are trying to get the law changed so females can inherit their fathers titles, since they will basically lose their whole lives because of those old laws (as only those with special exeptions that allows females to inherit the titles can inherit them, other females cannot).

With Monarchy it's differen't from nobility, before 2011 it was that monarch's oldest son was always first in line, after whom became all younger sons, after all sons of monarch, would become their oldest daughter after which comes the younger daughters. After 2011 it was changed so first born will be first in line no matter the gender, but this only affects those born after that time, so Prince Charles younger sister is still behind all of her brothers, even though she is second oldest. But this change in law only affected the Monarchy not the nobility.

And as we cannot say if Black family would one of those that would have female inhering titles, then we cannot say if the female memebers would or not, and it would still go abeyand in those cases, if only males could inherit.

***** How do you have Cygnus and any members of his family line inheriting before other members of Phineas' family as Cygnus is the 4th child/line?

Phineas had 4 Children Sirius (b. 1877), Arcturus (1884), Belvina (1886), and Cygnus (1889).

So if Phineas held the "lord Black" title then Sirius (1877) is the primary line and Sirius (1959) is part of that primary line. Now while Bellatrix is Sirius' (1959) first cousin due to her Aunt Walburga she is actually from the 4th line. So when Sirius (1959) dies (assuming Lucretia (1925) had no children/descendants) then the primary line is extinct and the secondary line Arcturus (1884) would have precedence for the "title". That means the children/descendants of Callidora (1915 (who is alive)), then the children/descendants of Cedrella (if she wasn't "truly" disinherited, and then the children/descendants of Charis.

After that if all of those are excluded deceased you would then go to the tertiary line which is the children/descendants of Belvina (1886). Only if all of them are deceased or excluded would you go to the 4th line descended from Cygnus (1889) of which Bellatrix is part. So I see almost no way for Bellatrix to inherit the "lord black" title unless a whole lot of people die first.

So when Sirius (1959) dies in (1995) the "title" of Lord Black would go to Callidora Longbottom nee Black as the living firstborn child of Arcturus (1884) the head of the second line from Phineas Black. When she passes the title would pass through her children/descendants.

Which may include Neville if you assume Augusta married Callidora's son. But right now with the assumption "lordship" can't be bequeathed and that women can inherit Callidora is the current "lord/lady Black i.e. Head of the Family.

***** For those "numbered" relations it would depend on whether the "head of house" Black did the disinheriting. If the "head" didn't then the disinheriting wouldn't take (which is why Sirius did not remain "off the tree" as Walburga was never the "head of the family").

Don't forget that if it is order of birth related you have the children of Callidora, Charis, and Belvina to consider (total of 4 sons and 4 daughters) and all their descendants as well as the children and descendants of those like cedrella who may not have been disinherited by the "head of the family".

********* Ah ok. Well if you assume that Phineas' father was the "lord" and he (Phineas) was disinherited (by the current "lord") before he became lord (versus after he died) then the entire "lordship" would pass through his sister Elladora because it would disinherit his whole line (assuming that's how his father set it up (and the only way this would work)).

So that would make Phineas' line the disgraced branch.

*** Well, there is no "Black Lordship" in canon, so Sirius inheritance was just Grimmauld Place (with the items inside, including Kreacher), and the content of Sirius vault.

We can suppose that, in the absence of a will, the whole inheritance would have gone to the closer living kin. According to the Black Family tree, all the Black of the previous generation died before Sirius (Ignatius Prewett and Druella Rosier are the only one still alive, and either not Black or Black by Blood).

From the Black current generation, Bellatrix was indeed the closest family member to Sirius and would probably have inherited the house. But I wonder if Narcissa would have come 2nd or if Andromeda would still have inherited it after Bellatrix (after all, Sirius was also burnt from the tree and still got the house). I also wonder if a potential child from Lucrecia Prewett would have had precedence over Bellatrix (since Lucrecia was the eldest child).

** If it goes by (A) pure birth order, then it goes to Bellatrix. After Arcturus' line ended, it'd go to Pollux's line. So, Bellatrix, then Andromeda, Nymphadora, Teddy, Narcissa, and Draco, before finally running out of Pollux's heirs and going to Dorea's heirs.

If it's (B) male-only birth order, then Sirius is the last of the Blacks. At least as far as that family tree shows.

(C) Quasi-Salic or similar, in which women cannot inherit but their sons can on their behalf. In which case it goes Teddy, Draco, Harry. Frankly I find this the least plausible, because witches can just curse the misogynist asshole who wants to skip over them.

Most real life titles are entailed, meaning you can't just choose your heir. Godson or not, Sirius can't give Harry the things that belong to him as head of the family, only the things that belong to him as an individual. This is why a lot of fics have Sirius adopting Harry as a "third parent". In which case Harry as his son inherits over Sirius' cousins-once-removed Nymphadora and Draco.

Of course, this isn't real life, this is fiction. So the lordship could have all sorts of fun restrictions on it. Perhaps it can only be inherited by someone with the surname Black. I have read one (1) fic where Nymphadora Tonks changes her name to Tonks Black and frankly there should be more. Perhaps instead of male-preference birth order, there's magic-preference order, in which titles go first to someone with the family talent (like Parselmouths or Metamorphmagi) and only then to those without it.

*** Why do you think it would go through pollux's line? He's the son of Cyngus who is the third son of Phineas black. So Phineas' 1st son Sirius is his primary heir, his second son Arcturus is the secondary heir, and Cyngus is the tertiary heir. So I would think that inheritance (if it is not designated) would first go through the primary heirs line until that line is exhausted, then it would go through the secondary line from Phineas which is his son Arcturus. If that line is exhausted then it would go through Phineas' third son Cyngus (who is the father of Pollux). Now while a female can't be the head of the family her son if she has one can be. If that isn't true then based on the chart neither Harry or Draco could inherit the head of the black family since they both come from females of the line.

Hence the Head of the Black Family flows from Phineas to his son Sirius through Sirius' son Arcturus, then it would flow through Arcturus' son Orion (though I don't think he ever became the head as I don't believe Arcturus gave it up). And then it would flow through Orion to his oldest son Sirius. With that I would say another commenter is correct and the closest relative to Sirius in the primary line would be lucretia. Which would make the Weasleys the family closest to the primary line of the black family. (It would have gone through Molly's two brothers first before her).

Now if you want to say who would inherit from Cyngus I believe that according to the chart that would be Draco. Pollux is his primary heir Dorea is the tertiary heir. Draco is descended from that primary line (Cyngus - Pollux) so he would inherit before Harry as Harry is descended from tertiary line (Cyngus - Dorea).

Now I think what throws people off is they look at this chart "generationally" to see who would inherit between Draco and Harry rather than following primary, secondary etc lines. So "generationally" from Cyngus the inheritance would look like the following.

For Draco it would be Cyngus - Pollux - Cyngus - Narcissa - Draco

For Harry it would be Cyngus - Dorea - James - Harry

So Harry is one generation closer to Cyngus then Draco is so obviously Harry would inherit first.

All of this leads to all kind of options for an author to use to decide how to set up the Black family inheritance conflict. Of course you also get to add that this chart isn't exactly JKR approved.

If either of those had a living non-criminal son then they would be the Head of the Black family.

If neither of Arcturus's daughters had a living non-criminal male descendant then and only then would the Head of the Black Family move to Phineas' son Cygnus and if that happens then Draco would inherit as he is descended from Cygnus' primary line (Pollux).

So the question is did Augusta marry the the son of Callidora Black and Harfang Longbottom. One fic The Reclamation of Black Magic by ShayaLonnie as Dorea Black (obviously part of the fan fic blacks) back from Stasis who decides to create a Black Family coven to protect Harry. In the story they have Callidora arrive with her daughter Enid who complains about Narcissa Malfoy joining the coven "because her sister tortured my nephew and his wife". That implies that Augusta married Callidora's son. Therefore making Neville being part of the primary line from Phineas' second son.

The story is a WIP and I think a fun read. It has a lot of information that illuminates the black family tree. Though I have never looked at it deeply enough to know whether it follows canon. We know Dorea is not Harry's Canon grandmother.

**** As I said, I believe that /after/ Arcturus' line ended, it would go to Pollux's line. OP's chart shows that Lucretia died without issue in '92.

So after Sirius' death, it goes to his children - none. His brother Regulus (1961) - dead. Orion's sister Lucretia - dead. Lucretia's children - none. Arcturus' brother Lycoris - dead. Lycoris' children - none. Arcturus' brother Regulus (1906) - dead. Regulus' (1906) children - none. Phineas (1888), if he's not formally disowned - dead, no children.

Then Cygnus (1889) - dead. Cygnus' (1889) son Pollux - dead. Pollux's daughter Walburga - dead. Walburga's children - both dead. Pollux's son Alphard, if not formally disowned - dead. Alphard's children - none. Pollux's son Cygnus (1938) - dead. Cygnus' (1938) daughter *Bellatrix*.

I skipped all the dead people in my first post because I thought it was tedious. I listed people whose faces had been burned off the tree because Sirius inherited despite that, so there's at least one disconnect between formal disownment by head of house and Walburga's temper tantrums.

***** Based on that chart there is another Arcturus who is Cygnus' older brother. Phineas' 1st son is named Sirius born 1877, the 2nd son Arcturus was born 1884 (far right of chart), the 3rd son is Cygnus born 1889.

So once you go up to Arcturus' father Sirius you go to Arcturus' oldest Uncle which is Phineas' 2nd son also named Arcturus and NOT to Cygnus. You then go to Callidora - alive (1915) and then to her two children (one son and one daughter who we don't know their status) if they are both dead with no valid living descendants then you would go to Arcturus' 2nd daughter Charis - dead (1978) and her three children (one son and two daughters) again status is unknown. Only if those three children are dead with no valid living descendants would you then go to Phineas' 3rd son Cygnus and then follow his line through Pollux.

So there are possibly 5 threads/lines to explore based on Callidora and Charis' children before you go to the Cygnus-Pollux line.

******* Will I admit that I've read so much Fanfiction that quite often "facts" seem to sometimes be a merger of fanfiction and canon in my mind. So I can admit I could (or probably) am wrong. Especially when canon is pretty silent on a lot of missing detail.

Pretty much the majority of the fanfictions I have read seem to have Augusta Longbottom acting as the regent of the longbottom family on behalf of neville, and Amelia Bones as the Regent of the Bones family on behalf of susan.

For the Bones family this suggests that Susan's father was either older than Amelia and/or Edgar or the family is patriarchal which puts susan (actually any son) in line for head of the family.

A quick search shows that Regents, family "lords", even "Head of House" are more Fanfiction concepts than canon.

This. The Black family is patriarchal. Sirius never got a trial. So all that time Walburga was living in the house while Sirius was in Azkaban? She couldn't legally do jack with the family.

And if Sirius was really disinherited, he would have said his dad did it.

​

Order of succession is: Sirius, Draco, Harry.

BUT!

IF Sirius named Harry as his heir (like he did in canon), It would be Sirius, Harry, Draco.

​

Draco could also be nixed from the running anyway. As there are a few fanfics where the betrothal contracts between the Black Sisters and their spouses had some stipulation that ensured they stayed in good standing (so it didn't shed bad light on the Blacks). Bellatrix and the Lestranges was arrested. Lucius swore servitude to the Dark Lord. This would essentially divorce the couples and make Draco a bastard. Lucius (or Sirius) would have to take them into their family to give him a name.

But this all falls under family magics and all that jazz. So your milage may vary.

Hell, Sirius could disinherit Draco just because he runs around calling people mudbloods and crowing about the Dark Lord.

** Walburga could try to disinherit Sirius as her son (but without His Father Orion actually doing it he wouldn't be disinherited. And Orion was still alive when Sirius ran away. She could not disinherit him as a Black since Orion's father Arcturus was the Head of the family. So as long as Arcturus was alive Sirius could become the head of the Black family and decide who would inherit after him.

Now the question is if Sirius did not designate who the next head would be then basic inheritance rules would apply. Which from what i see goes through the sons and (if allowed only passing through the daughters if they have a son). Now what i have never seen described is whether the blood line must be via male only or females allowed.

So if the Primary line goes Arcturus - Orion - Sirius and Sirius doesn't designate the head then you would look at Orion's brothers and sisters first. And then go up to arcturus and then up again to his father Sirius. Basically based on your chart I don't see how either Draco or Harry would inherit if they were not designated. For instance, Arcturus' father Sirius was the older brother. His next brother was named Arcturus who was born before Cyngus (who is the ancestor for both draco and Harry). So his line should take precedence over Cyngus.

And even though Arcturus only had daughters those daughters both had sons with the oldest daughter marrying into longbottom family.

So the stories that all say draco would inherit makes no sense to me based off of your chart.

*** I thought so too, but then I checked, Lucretia had no children. She was Molly's aunt.

**** The family tree appears to leave off the children of several of the women, she may not have been childless. But she probably was Molly's aunt or stepmother, not mother, that's fair.

** If they where nobility, it would have to be British title, and then it would have to go with the British rules of inherittance, where neither Draco or Harry could inherit it, untill all other lines had died out, so the title would be abeyan (untill such time only one of their lines was still there), as there was a female between and only males can inherit titles in Britain (Becoming Queen is different hting), explained in other comment if you want to check it out..

And Harry being godson, wouldnt' affect it at all, and yes Walburga couldn't disinherit him as titles dont' work that way, and if it's possible it can only be done by the one who holds the title, but not sure if it's possible.

** So if women can become head of house and you can't bequeath the head of house position and you also go solely by order of birth (excluding valid disinheriting).

Then when Harry's godfather Sirius dies then Callidora Longbottom nee Black becomes the Head of House Black. As she is the firstborn member of the 2nd line from Phineas Black (born 1847) - Arcturus Black (1884) - Callidora Longbottom (1915).

When she dies it would pass to Callidora's first born child (son or daughter?) and then to their descendants. If Callidora's line is extinct then it would go to her sister Charis Crouch nee Black line. Phineas (1847) - Arcturus (1884) - Charis (1919).

If Charis line is extinct then it would go to Belvina Burke nee Black's line and any of her descendants as she is the firstborn member of the 3rd line from Phineas Black (1847) - Belvina Burke (1886).

Under an order of birth scenario where women can inherit the only way for members of Cygnus' line to inherit is for all three of his older siblings (Sirius, Arcturus, and Belvina's) lines to be extinct (since he is the 4th line from Phineas. And from the OP Chart we know at least one Niece of Cygnus is alive at the time of Harry's godfather Sirius' death (we don't know the status of the other great nieces and nephews in Cygnus' brother Arcturus or Sister Belvina's lines).

Under an order of birth scenario where women can't inherit but can pass it down to their male descendants Cygnus' line still doesn't inherit as long as there is a single living male descendant of his older siblings.

So based on the chart and depending on whether women can inherit the Head of House or not the only way for Draco to become the Head of House is for either the entire lines of his great - great - great aunt and Uncle have to be extinct or there are no male descendants alive in his great - great - great aunt and Uncle's lines.

If the appropriate condition is met for the scenario. Then Draco would inherit before Harry (again assuming headship can't be bequeathed.

** If you accept that women can inherit the title (and it's needed for Draco to do so) then the most probable heir is Bill Weasley. Through Cedrella, number 4 burn mark. Or Neville through Callidora.

We have to assume that Sirius got to be "Lord Black" through Orion and not Walburga because for any inheritance model through which she could have gotten it would make it impossible for her to get it.

If you look at the first tier of descendents Cygnus (1889-1943) is the last one who would get the title. Draco would be the last person to inherit because a model that would see him as viable has a lot of other stops.
