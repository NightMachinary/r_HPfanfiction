Dumbledore hoped the Dursleys would raise Harry as a second son. He gets his wish. Except the Dursleys didn't raise a functioning member of society or a studious bookworm, they raised a fat bully. Why would they raise their second son any differently?

Basically it's just an idea that Harry is a second Dudley and goes to Hogwarts a spoiled, bullying brat. I didn't know where to go with it, so anyone is welcome to take the idea and write it as you see fit.

***** I agree, but if Bully Harry ended up being essentially useless for Dumbledore's ends, I see no reason why he wouldn't start mentoring Neville as a backup. Bully Harry essentially becomes a decoy. Why couldn't LV change his mind about who the prophecy pointed to halfway through the series, especially with some manipulating on Dumbledore's side?

**** Dumbledore makes his thoughts about prophecies abundantly clear. He believes that Trelawney's prophecy will affect Voldemort as long as Voldemort believes in it and acts on it. But, if Harry rejects the Power that [Voldemort] Knows Not by becoming a bully --- because fear and violence are powers that Voldemort knows all too well --- the Prophecy will simply fail, like most of them do.

He would just have to do the best he can fighting Voldemort without the Prophecy, and hope that some other opportunity to defeat him arises.

***** It doesn't make make sense that the prophecy would fail. Either prophecies don't fail, or they don't exist. If they don't exist, why would Voldemort act upon it.

A true prophecy is something that is fulfilled no matter what. That you act upon it or not doesn't matter. If it's true, Dumbledore won't be able to kill Harry. If it isn't, Voldemort wouldn't have act upon it in the first place (He's one of the better informed wizards in the world, he just has to know if prophecies are rubbish or not...).

****** Dumbledore seems to believe otherwise, or at least says so to Harry. From HBP, Chapter 23:

#+begin_quote
  ‘Yes -- just love,' said Dumbledore. ‘But Harry, never forget that what the prophecy says is only significant because Voldemort made it so. I told you this at the end of last year. Voldemort singled you out as the person who would be most dangerous to him -- and in doing so, he made you the person who would be most dangerous to him!'

  ‘But it comes to the same --'

  ‘No, it doesn't!' said Dumbledore, sounding impatient now. Pointing at Harry with his black, withered hand, he said, ‘You are setting too much store by the prophecy!'

  ‘But,' spluttered Harry, ‘but you said the prophecy means --'

  ‘If Voldemort had never heard of the prophecy, would it have been fulfilled? Would it have meant anything? Of course not! Do you think every prophecy in the Hall of Prophecy has been fulfilled?'

  ‘But,' said Harry, bewildered, ‘but last year, you said one of us would have to kill the other --'

  ‘Harry, Harry, only because Voldemort made a grave error, and acted on Professor Trelawney's words! If Voldemort had never murdered your father, would he have imparted in you a furious desire for revenge? Of course not! If he had not forced your mother to die for you, would he have given you a magical protection he could not penetrate? Of course not, Harry! Don't you see? Voldemort himself created his worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere do! Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realise that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back! Voldemort is no different! Always he was on the lookout for the one who would challenge him. He heard the prophecy and he leapt into action, with the result that he not only handpicked the man most likely to finish him, he handed him uniquely deadly weapons!'
#+end_quote

and later

#+begin_quote
  ‘Of course you would!' cried Dumbledore. ‘You see, the prophecy does not mean you have to do anything! But the prophecy caused Lord Voldemort to mark you as his equal ... in other words, you are free to choose your way, quite free to turn your back on the prophecy! But Voldemort continues to set store by the prophecy. He will continue to hunt you ... which makes it certain, really, that --'

  ‘That one of us is going to end up killing the other,' said Harry. ‘Yes.'

******* It's still strange. I dont mean that some strange force makes the prophecy to be fulfilled, simply that, once set in motion (when Voldemort murders the Potters and marks Harry), things will turn so it is fulfilled. Because it is a divination thing, prophecies are about how things will ultimately turn out. It means that through their chosen course of action, Harry and Voldemort will face each other and one of them will kill each other. If Dumbledore gets Harry killed (which seems a bit ooc, having a kid killed because he's a bully, rather than educate him...), then the prophecy won't be fulfilled. So either Dumbledore won't kill Harry, or prophecies are rubish, since this particular one is already set to motion.

** As he grows, his bullying gets worse and worse and he's soon casting spells that have intent to hurt other people, laughing. He doesn't realise he's being drawn into the Dark Arts until it's to late and he kills someone. He then runs to Dumbledore, sobbing.

But, it's to late and Harry has already done the damage and no one will forgive him. He was so mean and spiteful to everyone that they band together and leave him outside to fend for himself. He returns home, back to the loving Dursleys, and finds them dead.

Unsure of what he should do, he turns to his bullying partner, Draco, and walks straight into the home where Voldemort is.
