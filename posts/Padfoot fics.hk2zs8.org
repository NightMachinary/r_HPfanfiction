Do you know any good fanfics where somebody meets Sirius as Padfoot, e.g. something like " Down by the greenhouses" [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17658653]] or "I've had enough losing trust" [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17298815]] or "Black Dog" [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12675248/1/Black-Dog]] Those are all quite innocent fics but I'd like to read fics with any rating (from general audience to explicit). Also either fics with Sirius as Padfoot all the time or fics where he reveals his identity (and then there's romance). If Sirius is paired with someone I really like SiriusxHermione or Sirius x OFC Thanks ahead!


** Among many other things linkffn(Digging for the Bones by paganaidd) is this kind of story as well.

  Since Ron got a new owl, it's only fair that Ginny gets her own pet. She adopts a big black dog.
