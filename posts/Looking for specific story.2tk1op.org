Hi, I'm hoping you lot might be able to help track down a story I read a while back.

Plot outline is that after Hermoine learned she was a witch and got a wand, she broke the rules and started doing magic. The minstry arrived, snapped her wand, and banished her from the magical world.

Several years later she is working for the muggle government and is looking for revenge. Enter Harry, and stuff happens.

I hope one of you can point me in the right direction.

Thanks!
