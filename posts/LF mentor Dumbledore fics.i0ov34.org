There are to many manipulative dumbledore fics I want a fic that gets rid of Ron and hermione early but has dumbledore genuinely teaching and loving Harry and Harry becomes really powerful under dumbledores tutelage


** -"Today Harry, I will teach you how to transfigure Potions Professors into grease-covered male strippers." said the headmaster.

"Do you really need to use me as test subject?" asked Snape begrudgingly.

"Do you see any other Potions Professor here Severus?" Dumbledore asked, and continued once Snape didn't offer a response. "Good, now go over to that pole over there, yes, that will work." then turned to Harry, "Are you ready my boy?"

"I think so," Harry said raising his wand, doubtfully.

"So am I..." said the headmaster, pulling out a pack of low denomination bills, "Now Severus, do you want to keep a fanfic-worthy toned body after the exercise? Or would you prefer to go to your flabby old self?"

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

Lmfao I don't think I've ever seen a request like this and it's an idea I'd like to see more of. Only one I can think of is linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane)

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand and the incentive to survive. Thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.
