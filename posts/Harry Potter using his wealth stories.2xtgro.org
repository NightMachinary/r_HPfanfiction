**** Maybe at the end of the series when he is 17 and an adult. But prior to that?

People that young don't do that. They aren't even legally allowed to live by themselves. 13 year olds don't start businesses by themselves. (Cue the one story of some boy/girl in a million who did do that)

If such a story were to make sense it would either be when he's already an adult or -like Fred and George- starting as a small school business where he sells stuff to fellow classmates.

** I read about half of one where he put Molly and Fluer in charge of his vault. They made tons of investments, set up a research institute that Ginny was in charge of and Hermione was the head administrator. He bought an island and built a resort for magical people and put Gabrielle in charge of that. Frankly, it was horrible. There was no conflict at all.

If you want conflict, read his story 'After The War' or another 'Harrys Future' instead

** You'd enjoy the story Harry's Golden Nuggets, but I can't find the link right now.
