:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Title says a lot of it really. I believe it was a smut fic off either Hpfanficarchive or Ao3 First chapter was Harry/lily, second was all three. Was talking to a friend about odd smut we've read (we met through a Facebook fanfiction group) and I brought it up, they seemed interested in reading it Cant remember it very well but I believe harry started the whole smut thing with hermione on accident thinking she was lily at first until lily showed up. I'd appreciate any help finding this story, I can not for the life of me find it.


** Wait a minute.....Harry had sex with Hermione, thinking that he was actually having sex with his daughter?

** That was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10525594][I'll Show You]] but it's been taken down again. A classic of the genre that will surely be missed.

You can way back machine it though:
