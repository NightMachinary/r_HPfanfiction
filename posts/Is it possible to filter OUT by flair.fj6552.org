If it is possible, can somebody please explain to me how to do so? Do I have to switch to old reddit? Do I have to turn off night mode?


** I don't know about default reddit, but you can do that with the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Enhancement/][Reddit Enhancement Suite]] (RES) addon for your browser.

With that addon installed, whenever you are on reddit you can click on the settings console icon to create your own filters in the Subreddits -> fillteReddit -> Flair section.
