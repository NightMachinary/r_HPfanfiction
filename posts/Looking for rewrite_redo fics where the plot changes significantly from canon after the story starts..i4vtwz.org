A lot of fics that rewrite the original books tend to hit the major canon plot points even if other things change. I'm looking for stories (complete is preferred, but not necessary) where the plot changes significantly and the canon plot points don't happen. For example, no diary/basilisk in second year, Voldemort doesn't return at the end of fourth year, etc. I want something new and unique. If it's a time travel fic, I want to see the character making changes that actually matter, plot-wise. If it's an AU, I want to see the butterfly effect (a few small changes make big differences later on).


** Canon is pretty thoroughly derailed in linkffn(Harry is a Dragon, And That's Okay), to the point where it's basically a fun slice of life fic, with Voldemort as a mostly irrelevant nuisance. It's instead focused on class (and extracurricular) material, and how many dragon-related novels Harry is reading, and the Unusually Shaped Students club for those following in Harry's clawed footsteps (a Sphinx, a centaur, a pair of kitsune...). Actively updating.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** Here are some stories that I really like that don't hit the canon plot points once certain events happen.

Hermione travels back in time in this one and things change significantly: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7944847][Six Pomegranate Seeds]] by Seselt - Hermione's totally badass and so smart in this one. It is complete and has a sequel.

linkao3(7944847)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4594634/1/][Finding Himself]] is about Cedric surviving the graveyard battle, but seriously injured. It is very well-written.

linkffn(4594634)

In the ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052940/1/The-Bureaucratic-Error][The Bureaucratic Error]]), Remus Lupin is thrust back in time instead of dying in the final battle. He tries to use his knowledge of what is going to happen to make things better... the butterfly effect doesn't always go the way he expects. I love the nuance and insight Iniga lends to his characterization. It is a WIP and updated regularly.

linkffn(13052940)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6554218/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sword-of-Gryffindor][Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor]] is about Harry adapting after he's been blinded in a Death Eater attack. It has a sequel.

linkffn(6554218)

In the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6673903/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Blind-Seer-of-Durmstrang][Harry Potter and the Blind Seer of Durmstrang]], instead of having his name in the Goblet of Fire, he's sent as an exchange student to Durmstrang. This is the sequel to Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor.

linkffn(6673903)

And my current read: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/755028][Linear Circle series]], is really brilliant in the best nerdy way and there are lots of unexpected events that occur.

** I really loved linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036071/1/With-Strength-of-Steel-Wings]]) by AngelaStarCat. Unfortunately it's still a WIP, and the author has been having health problems, but it's got about 700,000 words so far. It's been a while since I've read it so it might not be quite what you're looking for, but I remember it different greatly from cannon. The basilisk does happen, but it's much different than you'd expect. Feel free to ignore it, but I thought I'd throw it out there.

  Harry Potter never actually beat Voldemort, but rather fought him to a standstill while Europe burned around them. Finding himself an unwilling part of a dark ritual to send him back in time twenty years, he is surprised to see how Dumbledore reacts to proof of obvious child abuse (Harry's), how eleven-year-old super genius and Witch Queen in training Hermione reacts to actually having a socially competent friend (Harry), and how much easier it is to shrug off the insults of munchkins when you're a grizzled war veteran.But there is one huge problem: being sent back blew out his magic entirely. Just waving his wand knocked him out the first time he tried it. Can Hermione help him though his classes even with his magic almost unusable? Will Harry be able to find the secrets to actually killing the Dark Lord and saving his friends from a horrible future without blowing his cover, or even getting mistaken for the Dark Lord himself? Will Neville Longbottom get better grades than him?

**** Here is a link. It was initially posted on fanfiction, but it contains a lot of references pulled directly from pup culture sources, so it was removed for plagiarism. The article details the issues quite well, and at the bottom are PDF downloads of the three fanfiction books, if you still want to read them.
