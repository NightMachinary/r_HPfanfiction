Perhaps Harry finds out all muggleborn and raised should have gone there pre-hogwarts for inculatuons and checkups, but he was never told, or perhaps he just wants the scar checked out.

For whatever reason he goes there, i just want fics where Harry ends up in St. Mungos and gets checked out by a properly horrified healer at his circumstances. Bonus with takes-charge healers who does their jobs and calls the dmle on child abuse/hogwarts mayhem


** More a short crackfic but linkffn(11265467) Petrification Proliferation just has the adults actually sit down and sort stuff out.

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

#+begin_quote
  On a trip to St. Mungo's to check on Moody after the Tournament, Amelia Bones sees a badly injured child in one of the beds. From that random encounter, everything changes. With a powerful ally fighting for him for once, not to mention growing affection from two lovely witches, Harry starts building his own family and begins to reach his true potential. Enemies beware.

** I'm pretty sure I know of at least one that fits your criteria besides the ones already mentioned, but I'm having trouble coming up with the title(s).

linkffn(5866364) has a healer who's horrified over Harry's abuse, but it's handled outside of St. Mungo's, and Hogwarts really isn't part of the story. It is one of my favorite stories, though.
