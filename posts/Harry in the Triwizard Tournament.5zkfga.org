So I get from a story perspective why Harry must compete, but how come in none of the fics I've read that deal with the 4th year, has anybody ever suggested a loophole abuse of the Triwizard Tournament itself? By which I mean: instead of having all 4 champions compete in the planned tasks, declare that the First task of the "Triwizard Tournament" shall be a foot race across the Great Hall, the Second shall be a rock paper scissors tournament, and the Third shall be a marksmanship contest (or other equally ridiculously simple tasks). You'll be done in an afternoon, Harry is no longer forced to compete (or else), and you can have the other 3 (the actual proper champions) do "exhibitions" for the planned tasks if it is important you don't call them "Challenges".


** It's entirely possible that the goblet knows which competitions are a part of the event and deviating would invalidate the tournament and harm all participants.

*** I also remember a fic where Harry just walked in the dragon pit, then got out 2 seconds after, and same for the other tasks, meaning he still competed, but didn't take any unnecessary risks, therefore completing the contract.

There was also another fic where he actually wins the TWT, while he reads /Quidditch through the Ages/ every task. I'll try to find it

  What if Harry's rebelliousness started a year earlier, because Dumbledore wouldn't let him go stay with Sirius in the summers? What would a rebellious teenager who was entered into the Triwizard Tournament do? H/G

  Dumbledore had tricked him into becoming a Champion but Harry wasn't going to take it lying down. He may be forced to compete in the tasks but who says he has to complete the tasks?

**** Presuming it's the one I'm thinking about (I do believe it is “The Power of the Press”), it's a Bobmin fic. That should serve well enough in explaining the “why” of it, even if it still doesn't make sense.

If there are other fics with the same stuff happening then I really have no idea but I can say that the way prophecies work is so vague that many an author probably use them as an excuse for a power-up of some sort.
