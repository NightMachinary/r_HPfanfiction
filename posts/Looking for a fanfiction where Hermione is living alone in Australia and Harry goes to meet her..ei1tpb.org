I think it's set immediately after 7th book, where Hermione leaves everyone and goes to Australia (either that or Ron dies and she moves to Australia) and Harry goes to meet her after many years and they get romantically involved


** Ok, I found it, it's called [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/977904?view_adult=true][Journey's End]]. You'll like it if you are into Harry/Hermione. Warning: Very NSFW

  Hermione vanished after the war ended. Five years on and Harry, alone and haunted by the memory of the night they spent together, is coming to visit after learning she is alive and living in Sydney Australia. Lemon warning!
