** The big thing I remember from this story is the Voldemort is absolutely livid about Harry's conditions because how DARE the muggles hurt his prophecised enemy, or any wizard for that matter.

Edit - Reading this again and I forgot how much of a Hermione wankfest this is. I like Hermione, but this story goes so over the top...

** Ah, can't wait for the next update in 4 years. The author has promised they'll all be dark, and I can't wait, because god forbid an Adventure/Romance story have good things happening.

#+begin_quote
  After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness. But despite having gained great power in exchange for a bargain with the hidden Fae, she is still unable to kill the immortal Dark Lord. As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.
