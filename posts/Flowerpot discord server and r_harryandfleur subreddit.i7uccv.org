This is less a self promotion, but do want to help get the word out. A couple weeks ago me and 2 others set up a discord and subreddit for fans of the flowerpot(Harry/Fleur) pairing. We were surprised to see there was nothing for it considering it's decently popular. Already have a few writers for the pairing in the discord and we would love to have new members join us both there and on the subreddit.
