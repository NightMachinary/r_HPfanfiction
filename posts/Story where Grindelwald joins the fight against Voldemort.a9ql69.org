I watched The Crimes of Grindelwald before re-reading the Harry Potter books, and towards the end the situation was so bitter that I kept thinking, if Grindelwald had to die spiting Voldemort and Dumbledore to die because he still couldn't get over the things that happened 100 years ago, what would have happened if he and Grindelwald had reached some sort of agreement (unbreakable vow?) and when things got dire they just released Grindelwald to help against Voldemort? He wouldn't have been a match against Dumbledore and Grindelwald combined and it needn't have been such a horrible war. They could even have done it in the course of the first war since it seemed rather hopeless before Lily died (I think Remus said something along the lines of "we were outnumbered 40 to 1 and they were picking us out one by one"). I think there is a realistic chance that Grindelwald had a change of heart at Nurmengard at some point of his inprisonment, since he had no interest whatsoever to support Voldemort or get out and get a life again by helping him.

*** Yeah, rather different to the Dumbledore-Grindelwald alliance that the OP envisioned, but funny in its own right :)

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. Now, if only everyone else would realise this...

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.

** Really, I hope Grindelwald gets more attention in fics going forward. He's always been a powerful character, with potential for interesting plot, that's mostly been ignored by fanfiction authors. God knows fanfic authors have taken background fodder before and turned them into leading roles. ... On second thought, most of those were female. And young. ... Someone get Grindelwald a super-crown?

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12867536/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Homecoming][Harry Potter and the Homecoming]]

It happens in the sequels of this one.

Warning: Extremely dark and with very violent scenes.

Dumbledore and Grindelwald make a deal so that Grindelwald can take over the fight against Voldemort after Dumbledore's death. Grindelwald ends up being a very brutal strategist, not hesitating to kill multiple people in order to win.

I was just reading this, in fact...

Small world.

Oh, nvm. You've gotten this already. Too late now.

** There's quite a few like this. I wrote one myself about 10 years ago, and I hardly came up with the idea myself. Mines not good at all, so I won't link it, but they exist.
