I just read Hyaroo's Hermione Granger's Guide To Gender-Flip Fanfiction and really enjoyed Hadrian Granger, which made me wonder if there are any well-written stories where the whole trio is gender-flipped, or perhaps just Hermione. I have read a good part of Session Transcripts, but couldn't get into it- Harry's abuse was too over-the-top , as far as I can remember the reasons, and I thought overall it was too ooc/melodramatic.

*** Thanks! It added some interesting changes to the character. I am not sure why the author chose to narrate in second person.

  Being the only boys in their makeshift trio, it was natural that Ron and Hector were drawn to each other. [Gender AU -- M/M, Happy Birthday to Dusk!]
