Anyone know of any good fanfics focused on George or Fred and George? I'm not really looking for anything with slash in it either...help!

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2506841/1/Surviving-the-Weasley-Twins]] Story about Fred and George's first year at Hogwarts. It's probably one of the best fanfics I've ever read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3378737/1/The-Weasley-Twins-and-the-Sect-of-Kai]] The sequel to Surviving the Weasley Twins.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4634460/1/The-Weasley-Twins-and-the-Kosa-Assassin]] Sadly incomplete. The sequel to the Sect of Kai.
