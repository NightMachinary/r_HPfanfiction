** [[http://keiramarcos.com/fan-fiction/harry-potter-the-soulmate-bond/][Harry Potter and the Soulmate Bond]], Keira Marcos.

Long, low conflict (well, post-Voldemort, but a few Death Eaters causing trouble), Harry's a bit of a Gary Stu, but definite romance and sweet moments.

** linkffn(Local's Guide to Life in London by Significant Owl) is romantic and well-written (and not read a lot). They aren't together yet but they're dancing around each other.

I really love "Three Seasons to Closure", which you can find on the [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7149][unofficial Portkey archive]]. Very sweet but never treacly.

**** The author of the first one began work on a longer story but never finished it. The closest in terms of tone, for me, would be the second one I linked (the one that's on Portkey), which is about 70k words.
