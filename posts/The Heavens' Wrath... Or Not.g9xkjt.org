Harry is in the Great Hall when he suddenly looks as though he needs to let loose a 'silent but deadly'. He asks what day it is. After being given an answer, he sighs and says, "oh crap".

And then a pair of wings gruesome tear their way into existence from his shoulder blades, and a flaming sword smashes through the ceiling like a meteor, embedding itself in the floor nearby.

Pandemonium erupts.

Harry is nonchalant, and openly says to the sword in a bored tone, "No, I'm not going to 'cleanse the world in holy fire' no matter how much you keep asking".

Yeah, turns out this is a regular occurrence for him. He typically ends up cutting his own wings off as though they were toenails to him and ignoring the sword, where it then goes away for another month or two.

He's a bit amused at the shockwaves his "monthly" caused.


** Harry had been feeling weird since he woke up. He'd ambled down to breakfast but now there was a sense of impending pressure, like he had to... Wait...

​

"Hermione, what day is it?"

​

"May the 1st, why?"

​

"Oh crap"

​

With a great tearing and cracking sound, a pair of wings tore themselves out through the back of his school robes, spraying blood everywhere. As the Great hall stood in shock at the sight of the Boy Who Lived standing there with wings as black as midnight streached behind him a sword, wreathed in white fire smashed through the ceiling and embedded itself in the floor in front of him.

​

"Not this again..." Harry sighed, turning his head upwards. "Right, for the sixth time, I AM NOT CLENSING THE WORLD IN HOLY FIRE, SO STOP ASKING. THE WORLD HITTING A CRITICAL MASS OF SIN AND CORRUPTION IS NO EXCUSE TO KILL THE INNOCENT AS WELL."

​

Kicking the sword with his foot he continued. "AND YOU CAN STOP SENDING THIS SODDING SWORD AS WELL."

​

Harry huffed, picked up the sword and headed out the hall. "RIGHT. I'm off to get rid of these bloody stupid things. It's all fun and games until you realise that you can't fit in a chair or a bed, then they are just a nuisance."

​

The slamming of the doors to the Great Hall resounded loudly in the stunned silence that was left.

​

After a while, a single voice dreamily spoke up: "So I'm not the only one that happens to."

​

And with a skip to her steps, Luna stood up and left the Hall as well, her progress followed by a goggle-eyed multitude.

​

"Do you think we should return her stuff?"

​

"YES, YOU IMBECILIC MORON!"

​

AN: May the 1st is the festival of the snake catchers, I thought it would be fitting
