Annoyingly I can't seem to find the actual prompt anywhere, but if anyone has it saved or anything please link it so the creator of the original concept gets some credit. It should be pretty clear from the summary which one it is, though I can't remember the exact wording from the prompt. With this quarantine hopefully I'll be able to bash some more chapters out fairly quickly. Anyway...

#+begin_quote
  Everyone knows that wizarding children often take on an aspect of magic during their childhood. Innate specialties. Children of quidditch players might be able to fly without a broom for a time, those raised by fisherman might be able to manipulate water with great ease. Harry Potter comes to Hogwarts able to heal from any injury. At least he's got Tom keeping him company.
