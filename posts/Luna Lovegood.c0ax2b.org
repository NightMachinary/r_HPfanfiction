  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. I repeat, not crack ! Plot takes a few chapters to appear but it's there)

** [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2023&chapno=1][Mind's Eye, Soul's Reflection]] is Luna's point-of-view of /Order of the Phoenix./

For one of the earliest Luna-fics in the fandom, it's remarkable how much this one feels /right./

** If you don't mind something on the darker side, I read this Druna that I thought was really good! It jumps POVs between Draco and Luna.

  Luna Lovegood is a prisoner in the Malfoy household. Draco Malfoy is her captor. After months of pain, Luna finally finds some sort of peace, but her safety and security is always under threat. The Dark Lord has plans for Draco, but Draco begins to see the depravity of his family. Their options are limited. Will the force of good finally win, or will darkness prevail.
