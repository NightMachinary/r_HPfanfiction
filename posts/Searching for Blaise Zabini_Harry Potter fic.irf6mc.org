:END:
Hello! So I searching for a very specific fanfiction that I have been unable to find for a while. I believe it was called something like Thirty Six Feet Apart and had Harry and Blaise working on a charms project together. There was ships like Dtaco Malfoy/ (either) Bill or Charlie Weasley and the Weasley twins/Rabastan Lestrange (not completely certain on this one). It also had Sirius Black getting rescued from the Veil. Please help! I would appreciate it so much!
