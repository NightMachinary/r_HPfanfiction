** *The Power of Love* and its sequel *Heart and Soul*, linkffn(11761312;11251745) are pretty good, if you don't mind its feminist tone and fem slash fics.

I like *Returning to the Start*, linkffn(10687059), a lot. How this Hermione handled a very damaged, time-traveling Harry is very well done.

*Ruthless*, linkffn(10493620), is bloody good, if you don't mind M/F/M pairings. This story is not long, but extremely well written.

*Broken Chains*, linkffn(7718942), is lunar Harmony. I like this fic a lot, and especially enjoy its sex and violence scenes.

*The Sea King*, linkffn(7502511), is a cute Harmony one-shot.

*Notebooks and Letters*, linkffn(3867175), is mostly canon rehash, but things became different towards the end. There is one scene in which Hermione killed a bunch of Death Eaters while naked.

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.

  Sequel to The Power of Love: Voldemort is back, the Ministry is in denial, and Dumbledore is stalling, but Jasmine isn't alone. She and Hermione are supported by new friends, defended by two shieldmaidens, and empowered by ancient magic. Eliminating Voldemort is the least of the tasks which prophecy expects from them, but how will these witches transform the whole magical world?

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
