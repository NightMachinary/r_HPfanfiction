Im looking for a well written Harry P / N. Tonks fic. Preferably still updating or completed. I have already read "Summer pf Change" , "The Never-Ending Summer" and "Jamie Evans Fates Fool" So please do not recommend them


** Look up, “The Philosopher's Stone Retransmuted” or something like that. It's a 7 book series with some pretty good and original ideas further down the line. Has Tonks be Harry's age though

*** It's an interesting series which sadly has not aged very well. Like with many old stories, the tropes are nowadays completely overused.

The other issue is Andromeda. There are a couple of scenes where Harry gets beaten up by the Dursleys, Andromeda is mad but still sends him back. The story is overall pretty casual about child abuse worse than canon.

That being said, the friendship between Harry and Tonks is sweet, even if the get together part in book 4 drags on a little.

***** Actually, perceived effects turning into actual ones is an interesting concept. I don't remember how well it was implemented in the RSeries however.

**** In this series case, I don't think it's just a matter of not aging well. I read it as it was being posted and my opinion of it then is pretty much the same as it is now, since the eternal struggle back then was to actually find an indy!Harry story that was done right. Anyways, this story does have some pretty cool elements in it, such as powering up the Philospher's Stone. I don't think I've seen that sort of thing in any other story.

***** But the novelty factor of many concepts has worn off in the decade since it was published. The fic ID is somewhere around two million and we are past 13 now.

**** It was one of the first fics I read, so I guess I didn't recognize the tropes at that time.

** chelseyb has some of the better HP/NT fics in the fandom. Her only completed 'long' (100k+) fic is The Rebel and the Chosen, which is essentially a canon-rehash with Tonks way more present. Some people take issue with that, but since the focus for me was on their relationship than the plot (and its woven well) I don't really mind.

she took all her fics off FFN a while ago, so you'll have to google it, but it's not too hard to find.

*** It's definitely the best Tonks story around and I'm waiting for the sequel. The friendships are on point and the characters feel alive and three-dimensional. The one issue I see is that a lot of the romance happens off screen.

** +Extremely old but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2567419/1/Harry-Potter-And-The-Summer-Of-Change][Harry Potter and the Summer of Change]] was my favourite Honks back in the day! Writing still holds up these days, i vaguely remember it had a few common tropes but imo it holds up.+

Ignore me, i read over it in the OP! I am an idiot :D
