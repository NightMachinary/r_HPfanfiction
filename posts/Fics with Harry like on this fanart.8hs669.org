Do you know any fics that have similar description of Harry or at least give off the same impression? [[https://78.media.tumblr.com/0025cb4e57e353b1648fbb84c5dbbb9b/tumblr_olbzwqnC1a1uj948co1_500.png]]


** The artist also writes on tumblr: [[https://blvnk-writes.tumblr.com/]]

At least, i think it's the same artist.

*** Could you please check the link again (At your own risk, i was redirected to a quite NSFW page to put it mildly), i think it might have "expired" but there might just be something wrong with my browser.

** I love her version of Harry. His beard and hair style is heavily influenced by Sirius in her interpretation.

** I feel like that Harry would be wearing socks with sandals, often seen in flannel pants, usually also wearing his robe as both pajamas and daywear. Perhaps carrying around a sippycup full of vodka, or a chai latte and a reusable snack bag full of organic kale chips, while pondering the dangers of frizzy hair and desperately trying to convince Hermione to use a new organic hair product he invented in his bathtub. Sometimes to be discovered praising the benefits of putting bicycle pedals on his broom so one can pedal while flying to anyone who will listen. Occasionally found playing his acoustic guitar in a breakfast nook, or discussing the merits of their favorite obscure author, while quoting love sonnets to no one in particular.

I kinda want to read this now.

***** There must be wizards that go out hunting magical beings that terrorise muggle areas. Imagine a rogue dragon that has to be dealt with because it threatens a village in Russia.

Wendigos popping up out of nowhere because some guy is a cannibal and someone has to deal with it before the statute is threatened. Stuff like that. Could even port in some of the creatures from the witcher if you were so inclined.
