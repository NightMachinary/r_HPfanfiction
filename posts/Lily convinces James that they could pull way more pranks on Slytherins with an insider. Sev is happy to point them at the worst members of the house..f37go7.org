** Bonus points: Severus actually starts becoming friends with the Marauders, but in secret. Snape doesn't fall in with the Death Eaters and winds up allying with Dumbledore openly after graduating. Since he never has a falling out with Lily, Sev and James have a rivalry going on for Lily's affections.

Flash forward a few years and you have your choice of "Lily Potter" or "Lily Snape," and Harry being a Potter or a Snape respectively.

***** You know the worst part of those types of fics? When they don't start out that badly. So he's related to an ancient wizarding family [Peverell] which doesn't give him enough gold to rule a country or family magics to make the Unforgivables look like pranking jinxes, but it is still pretty neat...

Bam, few chapters later? He is somehow the only descendant of dozens of great families, with marriage contracts and unclaimed vaults galore! Sometimes even multiple animagus forms and intelligence that dwarfs all!

****** I wouldn't really mind a fic where Harry takes an [[https://Ancestry.com][Ancestry.com]] Potion, which polyjuices him into his various ancestors for one minute each. Then he has to find out who those ancestors are and find out if he has claim on their fortunes or family magic.

But the fics you're describing just take "Harry has an invisibility cloak, isn't that overpowered?" and just crank it all the way up to 11.

*** Oh man this is going to bug me now. There's totally a (I think?) dimension travel story where Snape and Lily were definitely a part of the Marauder's from the start. I distinctly remember Lily and James both fell in love early and everyone (Snape included) accepted that they were destined to be together.
