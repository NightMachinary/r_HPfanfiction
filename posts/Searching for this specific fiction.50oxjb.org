Read this fiction a while back. But can't remember the name or find the story. It had only 4-5 chapters at that point and probably abandoned now.

In the story, Neville was bwl. Harry was in Slytherin. His parents are in St. Mungo's. There was no mention of Sirius up to that point. The story started at 5th year. The 5th year Slytherin's are no nonsense dark usually this type of story turns to. They also wanted to keep away themselves from Voldemort (including Malfoy).

Harry & co were more of a business type like Fred & George. They ran (illegal) quidditch betting in Hogwarts. All I remember Harry humiliated Anthony Goldstein for some 30 Galleon as he didn't pay after losing a bet in 4th year.

  Self preservation was a powerful motivator that sometimes made good people do bad things. At least, that's the excuse that bad people who think of themselves as good, give to justify their actions. Harry Potter wasn't sure he'd ever been 'good', but he knew he was good at being bad. He just always thought, that the ends justified the means.

*** Thanks. Definitely this one. It has interesting premise. Shame that it's abandoned.
