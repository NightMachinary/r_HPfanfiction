It doesn't have to something that makes you stop but just a choice you regret they made. It can even be in character for the story but you just don't want it to happen. Do they kill someone off, does someone leave? An example for me would be the Merging. A great story but I hate what happens with Tonks, it makes sense and is probably great for the story I just wish it didn't happen.


** I'll drop a story with a quickness if the author keeps adding new layers to the story "unnecessarily".

There's a story that was readable. I mean, it was full of cliches, but that's not necessarily a disqualifier. Several chapters in the world gets turned on its head because Harry randomly stumbles upon his not-dead parents and his surprise sister in Diagon Alley. /closetab

  Just before his third year. Harry finds his mother's school trunk in the Dursley's attic. Inside he finds a Japanese katana augmented with several charms and runes and documents he was supposed to have seen his eleventh birthday! Now, armed with his mother's "anti-magic" sword, he will carve his own path and embrace his more Slytherin side in order to defeat Voldemort.

Of course she is probably the exception to the rule. in the sense of fanfiction, one can write about a good story about teenage pregnancy specially considering that some people do make it work in real life. mostly you need to be smart about it and don't drop that kind of plot on a unrelated story

** Sure I did.

I remember once reading a fic that maybe wasn't great but was somewhat readable, and then a certain character made a very stupid mistake that almost killed Harry and they got estranged, then Harry went (in the middle of an effing Hogwarts year) to a Christian mass, “learned forgiveness”, and apologised to said person for ... I'm not sure what exactly because he shouldn't have been the one apologising.

It made me drop the story and anything of that author's I had on my to-read list.

Another time an author decided that dedicating a whole chapter of a story with clearly wizards and witches of no clearly visible faith to a rant (from the mouth of one of those characters) that is pretty much about why Christianity is superior to atheism, and the result ... well, the same as above.

I have nothing against Christianity per se, but just as any other possible plot element of a story, it should be used when and where it fits, and in a way that does not make the readers make horrified faces and/or flinch in either disgust or confusion. Those two authors failed to do it. And there are other writers and other stories I remember, but those two I remember the most ... possibly because I remember them both trying to defend those decisions and not doing a very good job of that.

**** Hmm, well, if properly justified and properly implemented I could see almost any plot element combined with HP. But religion, as any of the currently visible faiths rather than just elements of mythology with some deities of the old times being present in some way, is quite hard to both justify and implement properly; and, obviously, most people don't manage. So as far as most stories are concerned, I share your sentiment that they should not be mixed.

That said, the question of whether things like D&D deities---as proposed by [[/u/Evilsbane][u/Evilsbane]] in another reply to your comment---would count as “religion” is pretty much a semantical one, so I presume you did not include things of that ilk when you spoke of religion.

** The term I have invented to describe what triggers me to abandon a story is _____-wanking. I define this term as something the author includes in a story because he likes the concept, but it doesn't serve any purpose with the plot.

Power-wanking, for example, is Harry learning all sorts of combat spells, only to never use them in the rest of the story. Melodrama-wanking is everyone having heartfelt moments and tearful discussions and then the relationship dynamics not changing at all. Preening-wanking is involving secondary characters in a scene, just because the main character does something cool - you know you've read it, when a scene starts in Dumbledore's office and the list of those present include: McGonagall, Snape, Flitwick, Sirius, Remus, the Weasleys, random Aurors, other students and so on, and so on.

Things like this are subjective of course. The author might include things for reasons that are not readily apparent. But after reading so much fanfiction, I've developed a rudimentary radar for detecting bullshit that has no reason to be in a story.

** When they just drop in a villain out of nowhere, for no discernable reason.

I was reading this Harry Potter/Inheritance Cycle (Eragon/Eldest/Brisingr/Inheritance), and it was pretty good at first, the only long one to not have slash in it, and it played by canon really well.

It was almost perfect until the chapter after Yazuac, where Harry was shown that killing was something he would have to do, when...

Tom Riddle out of nowhere.

Now, I might not have minded it if Voldemort had taken the place of Durza, but the thing was, the story took place after the Battle of Hogwarts.

It spun some bullshit story about how the horcrux in Harry's head made the entire Kings Cross scene up so he could build himself back up using Harry as a host.

I hit the close tab button really quick on that one.

There was another one like this that annoyed me as well, a Time Travel story that had Harry and Hermione defeat Voldemort in he their first year, in the Stone's chamber.

It was going pretty well for a time travel fic up to then, but apparently Voldemort dying set up a Dark Lord worse than Voldemort.

Then they tried to call it the butterfly effect.

I quit out pretty fucking fast on that one.

** Fics where Harry turns into a blubbering wreck, panics, pisses himself or something equally as pathetic when confronted with danger.

I understand people want to make sure Harry isn't god-like (or any other super powerful fics) but even in canon, when confronted with something scary (Troll, Quirrel, Basilisk, Voldemort etc) he's scared sure but not a coward.

** Snaps apologists scenes. Like I was reading something and Harry found out that Sirius was kind of a dick(hadn't been told about the whole attempted murder thing yet) and Harry just went off saying Sirius was evil and the marauders were all awful people and poor Snape just needs a hug. I'm just like 'uhhhh no.' For one it's pretty clear Snape gave as good as he got from the Marauders. And like all that shit was happening either just before a fucking war broke out a war was currently taking place so yeah tensions would be high and factions are gonna start forming in school. I'm not saying the marauders are angels, but villainizing them so Snape can be the hero/Lily's true love is just bad.

Also whenever Tonks is killer or something similar. I love me my Tonks. There was one fic where she was brutally murdered by a 10 year old Harry that was really taken over by Riddle and I just noped the hell outta that.

** I have developed a severe dislike of stories that feature Harry as a little kid. Because the authors always want to make him some twee version of a Dickinson urchin who must resort to eating coffee grounds from the dumpster for nourishment and has bones broken every couple months. But he is still adorable and good-hearted and doesn't end up a raging sociopath (a legit concern for children who are abused)

Plus there's the weird thing where authors want write kid characters with inexplicable lisps and toddler talk because supposedly that's cute.

Edit: Just remembered something else that annoys me.

Another thing that'll have me hitting the back button at the speed of light is the "Harry is summoned to a parallel universe where James and Lily survived" stories. Because the characters ALWAYS develop this instant familial bond that's just weird. Very rarely does anyone point out that these AREN'T Harry's parents. They're different versions of Harry's parents. Any interactions at first should be awkward and confused. Not "they all hugged and burst into a pile of tears."

** Disclaimer - not a Harry Potter story. Also - potential trigger warning - rape mentioned.\\
I have a guilty pleasure at the moment - Twilight fics where Bella ends up with a different Cullen. At the moment I am reading a Jasper/Bella fic. In it they have this pretty well written romance where Jasper runs into Bella several years after Edward left and they fall in love. Eventually they end up meeting back up with the rest of the Cullen's and Edward is all pissed off and emo and pining over Bella still. I know, I know, twilight! But it was actually pretty good. It's novel length and it's a trilogy.\\
In the first few chapters of the second book, Bella and jasper are married, and we find out that before she was turned, Bella conceived a child so she is now pregnant.\\
Then it comes out that EDWARD RAPED HER IN HER SLEEP ON HER WEDDING NIGHT SO THE BABY MIGHT BE HIS. Every one is super pissed, he gets a few things thrown at him, but because he could potentially be the father he is allowed to live in the house, bond with the fetus, Bella forgives him, and then makes everyone else not tear him limb from limb. The only person that reacted vaguely appropriately was Rosalie(which you know why if you know the books), but a few weeks later, he wins her over WITH A PAIR OF DESIGNER SHOES! I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. I did not read 100k+ words for people to be so blaze about rape. Like their reactions are as if he totaled a car or something. Go sit in the naughty corner for a few weeks, we know deep down you're a good boy.

It's an issue that's present in other fiction too, not just fanfiction. Rather than fully explore and stretch out the premise they started with, some people will just go completely off the rails and make the story all about some other thing.

** I once started reading the first chapter of a fic on Ao3 and the summery made it out to a fic where Voldemort turns Harry dark but half way though the chapter Voldemort's meeting got swarmed by Stormtroopers... yep, it became a surprise crossover with Star Wars, and there was nothing in the tags to say it was a crossover of any kind.

I also hate if an author makes a character too rich and the heir of too many families, like oh Harry just found out that he's heir of all the Hogwarts founders, Merlin and Morgana La Fey and he's now the richest person in the world, oh and also now he's really attractive because it turns out his mum was a Veela that got adopted. if I read that then I just nope my way right out of that story.

** A lots of stories actually. For example, Innocent series. Good stories, plot similar to canon. But in trying to make Dumbledore character somewhat balanced than the manipulative version we see in many stories, the writer make the character so insufferable, I stop reading.

Another story I often say, I regret, is Stages of Hopes. In that story, in the other Universe, there's a well-behaved, good Snape && James & James Jr. exactly how Snape described in canon. I extremely despise when a story have this: a jerk James/Sirius to look Snape/Malfoy's great.

Snape's actually my favorite character and I like reading AUs set in the Marauder era, especially with SS/LE romance, but... God. James is not a monster, and Snape is not a saint. James's parents spoiled him and he was a shit at Hogwarts, but he never tried to kill Snape, and we're never given enough info about his parents to know what they were like. He ended up dying for his beliefs (despite some weird fanfics that portrays him as a pureblood supremacist, we know James's beliefs are those of equality) and family without a second thought for himself. Snape had a bad childhood and was obviously a damaged person, but that doesn't excuse his own behavior and attitude. I like that JK balanced the two of them.

After writing that, I guess I've realized that I like the idea of Marauder-AUs more than the reality. Alas.

**** I like to think they equally attacked each other but snape didn't have bad memories when he attacked them only when he got humiliated so we never saw the other side of the coin.. The tripping jinx in the hallways the prank spells to embarras himself infront of lily etc... After all they fought alot because of lily (sirius/remus mentions thats what the rivalry was huge on) I also never understood how they said snape knew loads of dark arts before 1st year... Half blood? abused mom? drunk dad? whered he get these magicke moste evile and potions moste vile?

***** It always a little bit irked me that Harry let his image of his Dad get tarnished by one side of a complex story from the memory of a hateful man. He talked to Sirius and Remus about it but Sirius had spent 12 years in Azkaban and probably wasn't the best adjusted, and Remus is basically one big guilt machine. So of course it's not gonna be the best explanation.

I'm glad he got over it later and realised that yeah, the Marauders did some dickish shit. But Snape was no better, he wasn't always alone, as mentioned Avery, Mulciber and other future Death Eaters. He held Blood Purist views, either to save himself or simply because he believed it. All of this at a time when the War between Voldemort and the rest of the Wizards was at hitting it's peak. Is it any wonder that things where strained between children?

**** Like I said in 2nd comment, I don't mind good Snape/Malfoy or SS/LE romance. Snape is/was my one of favorite character. Infact, I started to read fanfictions after DH & solely due to 'The Prince's Tale' chapter.

Again, over the years, my preferences have changed. I just dislike when stories which portrait James exactly how Snape described throughout the book. I mean I am well aware of James's faults. But when a writer identifies his faults based on his childhood emeny completely ignoring his good characteristics, I can't stand to it.

***** I agree with you for sure. Sorry if that wasn't clear. I don't know enough about James to say he's a favorite character, but I think despite his faults, he's a better person than Snape in many ways. He (and the others) accepted Remus when most other students would have shunned him and he didn't buy into pureblood ideology, even though he'd have been fine ignoring it. Those things indicate to me that there's plenty of genuine nobility and goodness in him. James's faults seem to come down to his adolescence and immaturity much of the time, and it drives me nuts that so many fics choose to exaggerate those to the point of absurdity.

I don't think making Snape "good" means that James needs to be demonized. I just wish there were more fics where he ends up accepting Lily/Snape, even if reluctantly. Unfortunately, fanfic writers often aren't good at balancing characters and their relationships.

*** I just finished Stages last night, and while I understand your point, at least the fic had the courtesy of admitting it was a n alternate universe where Sirius befriended Snape on the train instead of James - so James never had the tempering influences of Remus and Lily, and Snape got dragged out of his shell by his friends.

I was much more annoyed at the Edgyworld characters' personalities, but at least they were mostly consistent with their characterization.

*** Taste is individual, but I really like Stages of Hope. The AU James is just that, a very alternate take. Note that in the story, in one universe Lucius is a good guy and in the other he's the worst sort of sadist. If the reader can accept that the two universes have versions of the same person that are that different, then jerk James isn't such a big deal, and doesn't imply that canon James would be a jerk. That said, again, taste is individual, and I won't tell you you're wrong for not liking it.

No what got me was that [[/spoiler][despite having goodish treachers and having Sirius as 5th year teacher and having a population that is more willing to fight Voldy they still need the fucking DA!]] Makes no sense other than clinging to canon like glue.

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects.

It was already pretty ridiculous before that but i still kept it as a guilty pleasure read but that was just the last straw. It just seemed weird and unnecessary. Harry already had all that support from his truly ridiculous amount of hot girlfriends and several teachers. There was really no reason to add /that/ to the mix too.

** I honestly don't remember which fic it was but... it was a Harry centric fic of some nature, and the author made Snape evil. Like torture people happily evil. Since Snape is one of my favourite characters, I almost quite reading, just because it was so out of character. In the author's defence, I think it was written between HBP and DH, so they probably didn't think it was OOC. Anyways, they thing that saved the fic, surprisingly, was that the author killed Snape after only 3-4 chapters. Once I didn't have to read about an OOC Snape, I could just ignore that annoyance and enjoy the rest of the fic.

I also read a fic where in one of the early chapters, Bellatrix killed a pregnant woman. Graphically. I don't mind graphic violence, hell I even write some pretty graphic violence. But the way that scene was written, I just couldn't handle it. I didn't even finish the scene (in fact, I'm only assuming that the woman died) and I didn't finish the fic.

** Yeah, got some pet-peeves that make me leave ASAP - one of them is teen-pregnancy (especially if it supposedly is ok or even a great thing - NO WAY!)...so yes, I do have a list of things that make me stop reading a fanfiction story (the same things make me want to throw out real books, but I normally don't because I paid good money for those!).

I really hate it when authors do this and didn't have the decency to foreshadow it or put it in the summary (I get that there are people who love stories with babies/new parents etc. but I don't and I'd like to avoid them! Same for all the other things I haven't mentioned (example: There's a relationship and one partner is totally whipped...hate this! I think both partners in a relationship are equal and both have a voice - there's nobody "in charge", because if there is the other is the lesser and constantly plays second fiddle! I especially hate it if the woman is in charge and is allowed to badmouth her boyfriend and boss him around etc. etc.))

ps: I also hate what I would say is "feminist propaganda" (meaning works of fiction where the men get nothing done if there isn't a woman helping them or telling them how to do it...this often happens in Harry/Hermione IMHO (I get that she's a strong independent woman, but she's not this bad and Harry isn't a submissive character either...sure he could be more active and involved etc. but he's not just taking shit lying down either!)

** Wow, this thread has a lot of comments!

In general terms, I quit reading fics if they have extreme 'bashing'. To clarify, I have a very precise definition of bashing that's different from other people's; my definition of 'bashing' is when a character is portrayed as wrong, stupid, evil, et-cetera, AND this is used by the narrative to justify obnoxious, immoral, or outright illegal actions towards that someone by the main characters.

So, 'Ron is a jerk' isn't really bashing for me, but 'Hermione castrates Ron and leaves him bleeding in the Great Hall and gets away with it, because Ron is a jerk' is bashing. 'Lucius Malfoy gets fined for possession of dark artifacts' isn't bashing, 'the Malfoys have everything seized and are sold into slavery for not attending Muggle Studies classes' is bashing. ...Perhaps I need a new word to describe my personal definition of 'bashing'...also, by the way, that last Malfoys example did happen.

Also, individual case: Tonks was Imperius'd to attack an ICW meeting in France, and was apprehended; during her imprisonment, the French Aurors deny her any human contact (or a lawyer), use heavy torture curses whenever she does something even slightly wrong (like trying to open a door at the end of a hallway she's been ordered to go down, before being told to open the door), and force her to swear two Unbreakable Vows (1. Never commit a crime against a French citizen, ever, and 2. Always obey the commands of Sirius Black, and yes, it's noted that Sirius ordering her to commit a crime against a French civilian would kill her.) as a condition of her release, without convicting her of anything.

And nobody in the fic even batted an eye at this treatment. So yeah, screw that fic.

** Nearly every fic I try to read has something hard to swallow; getting an entire story to 'ring true' seems to be one of the rarest things in this community. I understand though, we're reading the unpolished work of amateur authors.

Most of the time we're just looking for something clever, fun, or interesting; a different take on a story we're all very familiar with. I read them because I love seeing people's creativity, and a lot of times it's just sifting through garbage hoping for something worthwhile. Every once in a while though you're rewarded by something really great, even if it's just one really good sentence that gives you a new insight.

I think every writer would benefit from reading "Elements of Style" and a Syd Field book or two. Really ambitious amateur authors should also read "The Hero With A Thousand Faces" by Joseph Campbell.
