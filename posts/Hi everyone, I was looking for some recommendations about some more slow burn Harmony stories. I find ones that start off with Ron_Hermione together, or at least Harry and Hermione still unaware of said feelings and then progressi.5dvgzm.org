#+TITLE: Hi everyone, I was looking for some recommendations about some more slow burn Harmony stories. I find ones that start off with Ron/Hermione together, or at least Harry and Hermione still unaware of said feelings and then progressively becoming closer are usually the most engaging. Any suggestions?

** If you don't shy away from pure romance fics I can't recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5594536/][Potato19]] enough. That author pushes all of my Harmony buttons. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11951348/1/All-The-Small-Things]]) is a good place to start.

#+begin_quote
  Set the summer after OOTP. Hermione gets struck by Dolohov's Curse in the Department of Mysteries and that sparks a change in the relationship between Harry and Hermione. They help each other deal with the grief, finding solace in each other and, eventually, love. Rated M for mentions of child abuse, some swearing and mild adult situations.

  Nineteen years ago, Harry told Ron he saw Hermione as his sister. Now Hermione is in danger and Harry's feelings for her begin to change dramatically, jeopardizing everything he once knew. An Epilogue compliant fic. Rated M for sex and language.
