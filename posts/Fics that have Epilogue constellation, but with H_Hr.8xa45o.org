Im curious, if such exist. So Harry is married with Ginny and Hermione with Ron, but actually Harry and Hermione are together and everyone (atleast the Quartet) knows it. I dont know, why they should marry their Canon partners, if they dont love them. Marriage law maybe? Im open for any solutions.


** This is not the first time I have seen constellation used on here. What does it mean in this context? I have tried Googling but I am not sure what is meant by Epilogue constellation. Can you explain please?

*** My only guess is some misspelling of compliant/compliance leads to an autocorrect to constellation. Somehow.

*** Fun fact (though I'm not sure if they meant it in this context though it fits) constellation is often a term used for a poly family. For example, mum, dad, dads two bfs and mums other bf all come together to raise a family. (not sure i explained that well?)

*** yes, Epilogue complaint.

And anyway "Epilogue Constellation" should be clear that meant is: the Canon Couples, so Harry s with Ginny and Hermione with Ron, married and maybe have children. Between the end of the War and the Epilogue are 19 years, so a lot can happen in this time.

  Harry and Ginny Potter. Hermione and Ronald Weasley. Nineteen years after the fall of Voldemort, they had appeared happy. What about two years after that? A tale of betrayal, revenge, and new beginings. Warnings inside.
