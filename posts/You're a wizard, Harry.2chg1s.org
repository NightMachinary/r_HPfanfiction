** Harry stood over the lifeless body of Voldemort, tongue flicking in and out absently. The corpse barely registered as human to his enhanced sense of smell. Behind him Dudley had stopped gasping in pain and horror long enough to lurch into a run. It didn't matter; he had a few days, even with the best antibiotics, he'd be dead too. A silver lining, though he idly wondered what this would do to his love life.

His scaly shoulders twitched into view as he slithered off, bringing the new reality of his existence back into sharp relief. He couldn't help but say it to himself, though garbled Parseltongue was the limit of his abilities.

"You're a lizard, Harry."

Sorry, couldn't help myself.

**** Harry stood over the lifeless body of Voldemort, and then sat down. The body levitated itself off the ground. Slowly the scene of Hogwarts transformed into a Haitian restaurant; his onlooking fans and supporters became disinterested strangers, looking at their meal. His cousin Dudley looked amused at Harry's distraught expression.

Harry stared into his plate, seeing the oddly shaped meal. Prodding it a bit with his fork, he whispered to himself.

"It's chicken gizzard, Harry."

***** Harry stood over the lifeless body of Voldermort, and then sat down. Slowly the scene of Hogwarts transformed into the area of the Second Task; his onlooking fans and supporters became panicked students, shocked professors, and aurors, their wands out, moving cautiously towards him. At his feet, the body of a man with the head of a shark lay still, its horrible, inhuman and lifeless eyes unseeing.

Harry stared at the slowly approaching aurors. Straining to catch their words over the din, he heard:

"He's transfigured, Harry."
