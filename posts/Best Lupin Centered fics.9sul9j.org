** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16126862][Wolf, Wolf]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/felix_atticus/pseuds/sebastianL][sebastianL (felix_atticus)]] - Remus/Sirius; character study from Remus' point of view, alternating between present and past. (Don't be scared away by the first person POV!)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/927712][Common Woodbrown]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/imochan/pseuds/imochan][imochan]] - Raising Harry and character study dealing with Remus being a werewolf. Some Remus/Sirius, but the romance is pretty minor.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/904][The Lost Years (Harry Potter)]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/ignipes/pseuds/ignipes][ignipes]] - Remus' adventures from 1892-1993. Includes very mild Remus/Sirius (almost negligible).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3503913/1/You-Want-To-Make-A-Memory][You Want To Make A Memory]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/530161/enitsirk][enitsirk]] - Mild James/Lily; details the Marauder's years at Hogwarts. Remus gets the most focus of the four.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/974964][Sweet Home]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/copperbadge/pseuds/copperbadge][copperbadge]] - The missing years between the Potters' deaths and Remus' return to Hogwarts; includes some Remus/OMC and Remus/OFC. The author has a bunch of other Remus-centric fics.

** Linkffn(Remus Lupin, PI) is pretty solid, though it's written kind of... abstractly? The writing feels like... the opposite of detailed? But in a good way. I'm describing it terribly, but it's worth checking out

** I think I'll drag out some ancient ones:

Expecto Patronum was written in 2000, but it explores the wolf-as-patronus issue a decade plus before Rowling openly made it canon. It's young Marauders (and Snape) on a tour of Azkaban. Blaise was one of the first Lupin-writers out there:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/37028/1/Expecto-Patronum]]

The Speculum Curse, from the same time period, is one of my all-time favorite fics in any genre or fandom. It gives equal time to each Marauder as they pass a personality-bending curse between them, but you could always skip to Remus' chapter:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/60352/1/The-Speculum-Curse]]

Fair warning that A Most Unusual Student was not only written before the canon material was finished, but was never finished itself. But despite the length, it has a slice-of-life feel to it so going unfinished is not as big a deal as would be if it were a suspense fic. It's Madam Pomfrey's point of view, though obviously Remus is the center of it. Very interesting take on the adults who are trying to keep a child with a stigmatized medical condition safe and get him educated:

** You might be interested in the Dangerverse series? Remus isn't the absolute main character, but he has a /much/ larger role than in Canon, and a fair portion of the scenes are from his perspective. In the first book I would say more than half.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9462005/1/Dark-Days][Dark Days]] A great Marauders fic during the First War

** 'Oblivious' [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2063033/1/Oblivious]] and its sequel 'Imperius' [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2469997/1/Imperius]], both by Jess Pallas, are my absolute favourites. Both are long, action-packed, focus on Remus discovering the secrets of his past and a mystery in the present, and the author creates her own unique take on the condition of being a werewolf. I would also recommend stories by Bratanimus and Gilpin.

At the risk of shameless self-promotion (not sure if it's okay to recommended our own fics in threads like these?) I have a whomping willow prank fic (6 chapters, 2 from Remus' perspective) called Raging June [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12876007/1/Raging-June]] and, if you're into Remus/Tonks, a story I'm currently working on called Flying Colours (half from Remus' perspective, half from Tonks') [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13001458/1/Flying-Colours]] Both on AO3 as well.
