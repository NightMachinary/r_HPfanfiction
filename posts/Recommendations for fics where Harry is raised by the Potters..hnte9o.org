I remember reading a while back where Harry was raised by the portraits of his ancestors in Potter Manor as a proper Scion, with a healthy hatred for Dumbledore. For the life of me I can't remember what it was or if it was finished. I would be interested in some more, whether he is raised by portraits or living Potter relatives.


** Was it linkffn(Three Black Birds) by any chance?

#+begin_quote
  When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween, the wizarding world hailed Harry's younger brother Thomas as The Boy Who Lived. But were they right? As Tom starts Hogwarts, wheels are set in motion, assumptions are questioned, and lives are changed forever. Harry's two years older than canon. Story is complete through the 2nd task, the rest posted as outlines. Adopted by Ashabel.
