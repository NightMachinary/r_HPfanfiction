:END:
I think it's about 5th year, Harry and Daphne were caught up in a marriage contract from the past. It was written several generations back that if two first born of Potter/Black and The Greengrasses fit these specific circumstances it would trigger the contract. Somehow they triggered it and the goblins sent out a notice. They go from Gryffindor vs Slytherin to being forced together to actually loving each other.

 

It was fairly long (200k+) and complete if I remember correctly.


** That's like half of all Daphne fics. Any more details?

*** Kind of my problem with finding it. Up to that I think it was canon story.

I may be mixing up my stories, but I think Harry is gone from school and people are watching her. At some point she's attacked in her dorm by Draco and she's forced to attack him. The whole thing makes her have to also flee the school and join Harry.

*** I think it's The Legacy by storytellerSpW. I browsed through the first couple chapters and I'm pretty sure it's what I was looking for.

**** They seem pretty similar(like a lot of Harry/Daphne contract stories tbf) but I'm pretty sure the one I remember was complete. Oh well.
