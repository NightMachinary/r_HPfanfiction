I have a few ideas (albeit not very imaginative) from Harry's accidental apparation, but I'll just talk about this one. So basically, it's a bit of a stretch, but what if Harry's apparation to escape Dudley took him somewhere else? To a place where he could escape from the Harry Hunting forever (except the Summer Break, I suppose?).

Any school would be fine, but I'd prefer it to not be Hogwarts (we see enough of that already!). Some potential scenarios might include Harry somehow making it all the way to that witches-only school in America (was it called Salem Witches Academy? I can't remember) or popping into one of Viktor Krum's lessons at Durmstrang. I always found absurd scenarios like this funny, so if anyone else here does I'd love to see how creative you can be!

Oh, and please don't make it a slash/femslash story if you do want to focus on a relationship. All the power to you if you do like them, but they're not my cup of tea.


** Salem's Witches Institute is a play on the Women's Institutes you can find in the UK, not an actual wizarding school. Also, Harry wouldn't be able to apparate inside a magical school because of anti-apparition jinxes.
