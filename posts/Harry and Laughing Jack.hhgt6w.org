So I wanted to write this- Harry Potter meets the infamous Laughing Jack. And survives, somehow. It could be because they're soulmates, LJ could just be bored and looking for chaos, maybe Harry shows the signs of being a proxy candidate early on. Somehow, they become friends. LJ will show up through Harry's childhood and Hogwarts years, and Harry grows darker under his influence, though he's able to hide it. I'm thinking Harry becomes a proxy shortly after Cedric's death, after seeing everything in the paper.

Not a proxy of Slender, no, a proxy of Laughing Jack himself. In this world, all creeps can take proxies, they just usually don't.

I'd love to have the Twins be proxies as well, honestly. I need more of them in these types of fics.

If anyone actually does this prompt, link it in the comments! I'd like to see what others would do with my mind's rambling.


** There is a fic where he is a proxy/ward of slenderman and all the other creepypasta's are too linkffn(Harry by proxy)

  Harry Potter's uncle goes too far and a broken, bleeding Harry is left in his cupboard. However, he is rescued and taken in by our favorite, faceless entity in a suit; Slenderman. How will Hogwarts deal with a corrupted Harry Potter? Harry Potter x Creepypastas. Dark-ish!Harry. Teen for general Creepypasta goodness and language. Manipulative Dumbledore and Weasley Bashing.

*** Yeah; I've read most of what's currently out for that one(at this rate it's going to be longer than Brother in Arms, and that has 93 chapters!). I actually thought of this prompt while reading Tale of the Clown's Mage, which is a Fem!Harry x Laughing Jack one.
