I am looking for hidden jems.The ones which don't have a huge amount of favorites/kudos, or maybe with misleading summaries, that almost make you overlook and then pleasantly surprise you, or not featuring in any community. Most importantly, stories that are only posted somwhere other then ffnet and AO3. Here are a few.(some may be still pretty well known) Give him love - James P. Jr falls in love with his herbology professor aka Neville linkffn(5675149) Their Verdict of Vagaries - Harry goes back in time to Tom Riddle and you now the drill. Not exactly unknown, but gets some really controversial reviews, that might put off. linkffn(5356546) A Riddled Universe Harry transports to Alternative Dimension where Tom Riddle is a famous healer. linkffn(8678567) The Never-ending Road Rewrite of cannon with fem!harry. surprisingly little favorites linkffn(8615605)


** It's cool that you had some interest in hunting out unrecognized gems, and I appreciate that you had some stories in mind and mentioned what they were about...

...but I don't understand the idea that three of the fics you listed have over a thousand reviews and over 1500 favs and you consider them 'overlooked'.

Try this on for size:

*** My idea was that by filtering all of hp fanfiction on ffnet by favorites, you'll have to skip more then 50 pages to reach fics that are less then 2000. And a lot of those "first" fics are not necessarily very good. Thanks for the rec, I'll be sure to check it out.

**** While I do /know/ that people filter by numbers of reviews and favourites, it remains a mystery to me /why/ people do that. It takes a matter of minutes to realise that numbers don't equate to quality and the whole thing becomes self-fulfilling because people don't even bother reading stories with few reviews. And by 'few' I don't mean less than a thousand, I mean less than two or three per chapter. And if you think that a low level of reviews means a story is badly written, well, quite frankly you're an idiot.

If I tried to explain how much this frustrates me, my brain would explode.

***** I think the issue is that there isn't another good way to search for general fics- once you make it through a couple recommendation lists, which are often peppered with some mediocre fics, people try to strike out on their own to find the good ones. The easiest way to do that is searching by number of favorites/bookmarks etc, unless you have a specific pairing or theme you're looking for.

******* Then you have to look separately for completed stories, and personally I'm fine reading incomplete fics, as long as they're longer than about 40k words, enough to keep me occupied for an hour and a half or so. I usually search by 60k+ words, English, and favorites. Then I skip the first 50 pages or so, since I've probably read most of those, and go from there.

***** Exceptions may apply, but 200 Favorites seem to be the border between decent and bad fics.

On the other hand, I see no major difference in quality for fics with more than 500 Favorites.

My personal top 10 fics have Favorites ranging from 180 (The Dark Lord Never Died) to ~11000 (Delenda Est).

****** It wasn't addressed to you but to people in general. The fact that people are using the sort-by-favourites option for their searches comes from the fact that the general populace does seem to equate the number of favourites with the overall quality of stories. You have proven otherwise by asking for stories that don't really have a high number of those, sure, but there are people who automatically reject stories that are low in favourites or reviews on the basis that the low number of those means that the story has to be shit and that's it, and who automatically accept anything with a high number of reviews or favourites as great just because of that no matter what the quality is.

That is what the person you replied to is going on about, not anything you did.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/636397/lorien829][lorien829]] writes great Harmony fics without bashing. "Resistance", "Shadow Walks", and "Shadow Walker", linkffn(2746577;6092362;11305263), deserved IMO more far more recommendations here and Favorites on FF.net.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1865132/Hyaroo][Hyaroo]]'s female Ron stories "Weasley Girl" and "Weasley Girl: Secrets of the Past", linkffn(9932798;8202739), are highly interesting and should get more mentioning.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2819741/theelderwand1][theelderwand1]] wrote a fairly decent postwar series including "Stop All The Clocks" and "Children's Crusade", linkffn(6884267;6989327). I like them a lot and recommended quite a few times here, but I don't understand why they got so few Favorites on the FF.net. Are R/Hr stories really that out of favor?

#+begin_quote
  Transcribed from back cover of book:  Professor Cuthbert Binns (living: 1865-1963, haunting: 1963- ) is the leading Magical Historian of his day. He has published widely on topics ranging from, 'The origins of magic in native rock art,' to 'Wizard-Muggle relations through the ages', and was awarded an Order of Merlin (second class) in 1936, when his seminal work, 'A History of the magical world in 100,000 pages' became the best-selling Historical text on record.  This volume, however, is - for the first time - autobiographical in nature. It is thus also somewhat experimental in nature, but serves to remind both the author and the reader that we each build the fabric of History, in our own ways, however small.  Author: C. Binns. Dictation: Gluey the House elf.Production: A.P.W.B. Dumbledore, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,Published, 1964; Revised, 1991.

*** I love the Professor Binns one, it's one of my all time favourite fanfictions (I'm fairly sure I found it thanks to your recommendation). It definitely deserves more attention, it's such a beautiful story.

** A random few of my favourites. Most of my favourites have low numbers of reviews. I am a very fussy reader and I tend to assume that a lot of reviews means something won't be to my taste for one reason or another. The authors of the one-shots also have excellent multi-chapters, so do look at their other stories too.
