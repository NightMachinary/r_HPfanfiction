** Well, it's rather simple. Snape got more exposure and got an attempt at redemption towards the end after spending the beginning of his life doing questionable things.

With James, the things are more clear cut: he was a jerk, he stopped, he grew up, he became a good person, good father, good husband, good friend... he got his fair share of criticism for what he did do wrong in his short life, and the topic was exhausted.

So, it's not "Dare not besmirch the name of Saint James!" and more "Yeah, we get it. He was a prick at times. Can we stop beating a dead horse?".

*** i mean, he was a good friend to Remus, Sirius and Peter before matuiring, eg becoming an animagus to help Remus out, or the creation of the Map for the same agenda.

Snape was abused little shit that became the abuser, simple as that.

** James Potter in school was a spoiled little shit with several redeeming qualities who matured (like most people in life) to become a good man who fought in a war for a side that was definitely the good side, and ultimately died for his wife and child. His loyalty to his friends, his refusal to judge a person for something like blood status, and yes, his decision to fight in a war he could have easily avoided because it was the right thing to do are all signs why he's a good man.

The relationship between James, his friends, Lily, and Snape is a complicated one and one of the best parts of the series IMO. Snape is a vindictive little shit head who definitely gave as good as he got, didn't deserve the (terrible) home life he had, and pulled his own stunts. He created spells like Sectumsempra in school for a reason. Let's not forget he was after Lupin to "out" him for years. James and his friends undoubtedly also targeted him and spurred on the terrible relationship.

But don't get it twisted that somehow Snape was driven into the Death Eater's arms by the bullying. In his memory sequence, Lily gives him shit for several years on the people he chooses to hang out with, and he loses his one lifeline of sanity and good due to his own fault. There's no excuse for using the slur. If anything, there's far more interesting material with Snape and his acrimonious relationship with his muggle father, and his parents abusive marriage that shapes his ideas about Muggles, and wizards, and the grand world Order. His friendship with Lily is an aberration to his usual group of friends, not the norm.

We see only one memory because James has been built up by all these people who knew him for Harry, and he needed to be deflated, shown that he was a human with his own flaws. This sub is so eager to cast people into neat little boxes and often forget that at Hogwarts, people are kids and teenagers. People do stupid things as teenagers, and then they gain empathy, critical thinking, and become better people. Or maybe, they don't. But everything regarding James, and even Snape, show that they both did in their own, complicated way.

Why do you say that? Rowling said that what the Marauders did to Snape was bullying, not a rivalry. I am honestly astounded that people try to spin it so it looks better for James and his friends, when they literally always fought him two-on-one. Also, he never pulled his own stunts. Lily was angry at him for being friends with people who did bad stuff, which would suggest he wasn't there when they did things like that. I feel you're taking Sirius and Remus for their word instead of recognizing that they've lied and toned down what James did to Snape. In PoA, Remus even said that Snape hated Harry because he was jealous of James' Quidditch ability, for God's sake!

The thing is, James never does that. He still bullied Snape regularly, even after he was said to have "reformed". After that, we don't know what he was like, but since his best friend, Sirius, is basically mentally stuck as a 21 year old, we can safely say that he never changed. Sirius and Remus were smiling fondly when they remembered bullying Snape. Sirius still called Snape that cruel nickname, and when Snape was knocked out in PoA, he took delight in knocking Snape around. At this point, Sirius didn't remember Snape as anything but the boy they bullied in Hogwarts, but he /still/ hated him with a passion.

Edit: Stay salty, bully apologists. Snape is a shitty person, but he /was/ bullied by the Marauders.

First of all,this was never mentioned in the books. I don't believe the marauders bullied Snape. Yes,they fought him 2v1 but that doesn't mean it's bullying. James did bully other students by hexing them but not Snape. Snape was trying to get remus expelled from society ffs. Also your point about Snape's jealousy. Believe it or not,it was there. In the deathly hallows(the Prince's tale),it's obvious Snape was jealous of the marauders. He was trying to show everyone they were not so great and brought up that topic when there was no need to do so. I would've qouted him but I really need to sleep rn.

Snape had a bigger role in this,cmon. He invented spells like senctum sempra which could be used to kill somebody,if you're saying he never used it,idk what to say to you. Also the point was he was hanging out with people whose life ambitions were to be terrorists. Hell,lily calls him out for calling every muggleborn except her a mudblood in the deathly hallows.

Unless you've proof that what they were saying was wrong,you can't just say they were lying. I can say that Snape was lying and James was a good guy all along bcoz Snape wanted to ruin Harry's perception of his father(this is an example,a horrible one,I know but I can't think of anything else).

1. Let's just conveniently forget that "Snape never missed an opportunity to curse James"(ootp),k?
2. They weren't remembering bullying Snape,they were remembering the friend they had for 10 years. They were talking about him ruffling his hair and playing with the snitch not about hexing Snape.
3. This was a man who just tried to get Sirius kissed by a dementor,do you really expect a man who didn't have a single happy thought in 12 years to care if he got hit a few times(let's not forget this is not real life and getting hurt like that won't hurt you in anyway whatsoever)

Also the main point is that the marauders (excluding Peter) were better than Snape. I'm not saying they were great people at 15. But neither was Snape. The thing is the marauders grew up and became excellent people. Idk why it's so hard for every Snape fan to forgive some 15 year olds but so easy to forgive a terrorist

So you think your opinion is more important than the author of the series' intentions? Also, even if you don't believe the author, why don't you just look at the one incident we actually see? It's pretty obvious they are bullying Snape there, right? Sirius perks up like a dog when he sees Snape, but when Snape sees them, he gets scared. Or when asked what Snape ever did to hime, James responded that “it's more the fact that he exists, if you know what I mean?”.

Also, he was /deliberately/ doing that to Snape, so don't act like it was just a few accidents. Even Snape, who's an immature asshole, had the honor and dignity to not do that to Sirius when he was unconscious and Snape was levitating him.

1. See like i said,i was talking about the books. After reading them,i got the feeling that it was a rivalry. 2v1 sure,but still a rivalry. Im not talking about what jkr intended. Even if James bullied him,its not as if Snape didn't do anything to him. We know that one of the reasons they attacked him was him trying to get Remus expelled. Do you think James would tell this to lily and everyone else ?? And let's face it,James was very arrogant,he wasn't going to argue with lily about how Snape was a horrible person. I hate this part of the marauders and according to me,they were bullies like I said in my previous post,just not towards Snape. Also do not ignore the fact that Snape cursed James at every opportunity too. Just bcoz we don't have an incident of it,doesn't mean it didn't happen.

#+begin_quote

We don't have a marauders era series. We do not know if he did it towards other people or not,I'm assuming he did bcoz he titled it "for enemies". This could mean anything from the marauders to muggleborns. But That's not what I'm saying. His plan was to become a frickin terrorist. That's the point. He invented curses that were used for bullying. Don't understate Snape's bigotry. Also he called using dark magic on a girl "just a laugh",something which lily considered to be worse than what the marauders ever did.

Yes,he knew it after the incident but he had a pretty good idea of what Remus was before it. Lily knew about his theory, Snape saw Remus go to the willow,he had a pretty good idea of what Remus was. (Deathly hallows,lily talks about his theory). The reason Sirius told him about it was to stop him from spying on them.

We have no proof that they lied,CMON. And i said that they were bullies in my first post. Yes,he thought it was out of order,Sirius thought they were idiots,even I think they shouldn't have done that. See the thing is,the marauders grew up,they stopped bullying and became excellent people. Snape did too but he was a bully for way too long. He abused his authority to bully children 20 years younger than him. Im not going to defend the bullying the marauders did. I said this in the first post,it's not my fault you ignored it(atleast i think i did,i need to recheck). I think Snape was worse than the marauders for being a terrorist and bullying children while the worst thing the marauders did was bully their peers.

#+end_quote

1.They ignored it,they still hated snape,and they chose to think about how stupid their friend was. 2. Well,do you really think they'd feel guilty for something they did when they were 15,and they did feel bad,you can see how Sirius said they were idiots,how Remus said he should've stopped them. They felt guilty but it was not so much,afterall the person they bullied was the reason one of them was jobless and the other was a convict.

  Harry went right after Black, who was still making Snape drift along ahead of them; he kept bumping his lolling head on the low ceiling. Harry had the impression Black was making no effort to prevent this.
#+end_quote

1.Doesn't mean he was doing it on purpose,it means he didn't care about it. 2. He was going to get Sirius kissed by a dementor. Without listening to the full story. Even after he knew that Peter was an animagus,after he knew that Ron had a rat. One of the reasons I hate snape. 3.Also Sirius didn't interact with anyone in more than a decade,he had nothing except his thoughts,thoughts which were never happy. Why do you think he would care if a man who's trying to get him killed bumps his head a few times.

***** JK Rowling clearly said it was bullying not rivalry. And the lake scene that lead to Snape and Lily breaking up. That scene showed it was bullying. Sirius and James basically attacked Snape with provocation.

And this "it was a rivalry". Oh please, we have never been shown a single time where Snape went after the Marauders. It was always the Marauders attacking Snape. Him creating the spells was a means to protect himself from a group of 4 boys who gang up on him.

You've got it backwards, Lily married James because he changed.

Paraphrasing here, but Sirius basically says James got over himself, and grew up 6th and 7th year. And that's when Lily started to give James the time of day.

Ron's teddy bear and Montague would like to have a word. Ron now has a pathological fear of spiders and Montague nearly died after being shoved in a damaged vanishing cabinet. Additionally, no context is given in the record for the hex James and Sirius used. So what's more likely, the pair were randomly targeting people with illegal hexes, or it was a Slytherin that 'deserved it'. Like the twins and Montague.

James Potter was a spoiled little shit that grew up. Even in his spoiled little shit days, he befriended a werewolf most would ostracize. He married the woman of his dreams, fought against a Dark Lord and died protecting his son. The only people who suggest anything different are Snape and Voldemort. And those are great character references.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I don't think that's quite what OP means. I think OP means that the only /evidence/ we as readers have that James changed is the fact that ultimately Lily married him, because his growth takes place off screen. However, I don't think that's quite right either. We may not see it directly, but there are enough clues in what we do know to show he matured.

1. He became head boy. Now, Dumbledore may be mad, but he's not stupid. If James hadn't shown signs of growing up he wouldn't have been given that kind of responsibility. You can't make someone the head boy if they're going around hexing random students, so we have to assume James no longer does that - /especially/ as he wasn't already a prefect so the appointment was a rather left-field one.

2. Joined the Order. Spoiled little shits don't join resistance groups. Not ones that have to actually fight anyway. They may join protest groups, but to actually choose to put oneself in the line of fire when other options are available isn't the action of a spoiled little shit.

3. Was happy for Sirius to live with him, and treated him as a brother. Truly spoiled brats don't know how to share, even with people they like. James saw that Sirius needed a proper family, and was prepared to share his. Can you see Dudley doing that, even for a member of his gang? No, of course not. Dudley hated anyone else getting attention or gifts or affection because he was truly spoiled.

4. How distraught McGonagall was when they died. Minerva is fair, and yes she favours her Gryffindor students, but the fact she was genuinely distressed about James shows that he grew into a person she could be proud to have had a hand in the upbringing of. Obviously a teacher would be sad and shocked if any of their former students died, but can you see McGonagall crying over, say, McClaggen and taking a whole day out to check his child has a safe place to live? Nah. The fact she did this for James and Lily shows they were special to her. For McGonagall to play favourites, the student must have been more than decent.

5. The way everyone talks about him - the conversation Harry overhears in POA is one of the best examples. There's genuine affection about James there from the adults who taught him. I can imagine McG, Hagrid and Flitwick talking like that about the Twins, can't imagine them talking like that about Malfoy. James must have grown up at some point during Hogwarts, because the people who taught him at Hogwarts had genuine respect for him.

6. What Harry hears when the Dementors come near him. "Take Harry and run" is not what a spoiled brat would say or do. A weak, bullying kind of character would throw others under the bus to save their own skin - look at Malfoy and his vanishing cabinet. Yes, he was probably going to die if he didn't make an attempt, but he was prepared to put every single person in that building in danger to save himself. James stood up to Voldemort without a wand just to give Lily and Harry the slightest chance. He didn't give one thought to himself, he only thought of them and their safety. He didn't try to hide with them, or run with them. He put himself in the line of fire so that his wife and son might live.

There's other bits and pieces of context clues, such as him befriending Remus when he knew he was a werewolf, and I know there's a lot of fanon that says he used Peter and saw him as a weak hanger-on, but nothing in canon suggests he saw Peter as anything other than a friend and equal despite his own skill being far superior.

James was a twat between the ages of 11-15. But find me anyone who wasn't. Teenagers are generally horrific beings. They think they know it all, their world view is very limited but they can't admit they're wrong. James is clearly an example of this when younger. Gryffindor good, Slytherin bad. No room for nuance. But he quite clearly grew up and became a fair person. Malfoy is still making black and white decisions based on limited thinking at the age of seventeen, and Snape never grows up (partially not his fault, but also, adults take responsibility).

Are you new to the fandom? Or the sub? That's the only explanation I can come up with for this statement here. The post in general, tbh, as even most of his fans agree he was a jerk and a bully.

Or was this inspired by the recent James' posts where they were asking for the adult version of him not being abusive towards his friends, wife, and kid(s)?

#+end_quote

on [[/r/HarryPotterMemes][r/HarryPotterMemes]] there's a "James Potter was a terrible person" thread almost every Saturday/Sunday :D

The thing with James is that we know very little of him and those bad things we know usually come from Snape, who hated James. I find it hard to believe James was the version Snape presented.

He was an asshole when he was a teenager, that's for sure. We saw it in SWM, Harry read all about detentions his father and Sirius got when they were at school for hexing other students in the corridors and other unpleasant things and finally, Sirius and Remus admitted they were brats. What we lack is context. We saw Snape's worst memory, but we didn't see "the time I got James Potter real good", so you can't compare who was worse. You don't know how this rivalry really looked because you only know bits and pieces and you got it from someone who's not really objective.

There's also a bunch of people who say James Potter was a good man, which is why I believe he had changed even if we didn't see it. People can grow. James probably heard all of those terrible stories about werewolves, but he didn't shun Remus when he found out about his lycanthropy. He befriended Sirius, who came from the family believing purebloods are above everyone else and was into dark magic. He fought against the whole pureblood supremacy bullshit even though it put him in danger - James was a pureblood, he could have sat the war and wait out to see who won.

** I think you'll find a lot of people here or on related reddits tend to go over Snape/Potter Snr mess regularly whether things are good, bad or indifferent. A few points in regards to this discussion though.

The magical world seems to attract people that lack some level of empathy for others. DEs in general, Riddle, Dumbledore, McGonagall, the Marauders, Snape, Crouch (both of them), Fudge, Umbridge... the list is probably longer than the M6 motorway, but most are willing to step on others or hurt them in some way, or just don't see people as individual people with their own needs and it's not just 'pure bloods' or 'half bloods' either.

Granger attacked Weasley with a bird conjuration spell, practically instigated the theft (temporary, fortunately) of a fairly expensive piece of property to "protect" someone old enough to at least /think/ for themselves and sets an enchantment on a parchment that scars someone possibly permanently with no warning before hand.

Others have already mentioned the Weasley twins, honestly what little we see of Finch-Fletchly strikes me as that he's an arrogant ass and MacMillan is quick to jump on the 'Potter bad' train, heck most Hufflepuffs seem to have "issues" with Harry for some reason. You've also got what happens to Luna, within her own school house. Then you've got Malfoy's crowd repeatedly, the slug vomitting and bat bogey curses from Ron and Ginny, Lockhart's narcissism and mind rape and the way Harry, Hermione and Neville are treated after the dragon incident. Hell, Neville's family and... Seamus' mother revealing late that she's a witch, potentially nearly causing him to grow up without a father if his dad walked at the news.

There's also the fact that about all we really get (as published in the books) of James is hearsay and one 'memory' that was probably at least spliced due to how Harry managed to follow his father and Sirius when Snape went a different way and tracked them until they attacked Snape and hoisted him by his leg.

Yes James likely is arrogant, he was a late, spoiled child. Like most children, once he /really/ started seeing the consequences of his actions and found the hurts coming back on him for one reason or another, he grew up. Others didn't, in spite of being in similar or even opposite positions.

Something to be aware of is that James Potter grew up partitially in a civil war, all of them did. No doubt both sides were recruiting in the school, and even with bullying that went both ways, everyone chose their sides of their own will.

We also hear from others that not only is Snape curious enough about Remus (or wanting to hurt the marauders enough) to tempt death (it was known that the willow could take out an eye at the least) by following the instructions of someone he supposedly hates. Not only that, but Snape hangs out with those that are actively bullies if not potential murderers themselves, in spite of probably should be hating their actions due to how similar it likely would be to his treatment by his father.

The whole situation in Magical Britain would just microcosm in Hogwarts, where there's already dividing lines, rivalry and teenage arseholes.

Regarding Sirius post escape. He's dealing with a metric ton of trauma build up. He was abused by his mother, attacked by her servant on her order, belittled for prefering courage to cunning and had to listen to rants about 'blood status' until he eventually booked. Not long after, the two people who actually cared for him as adults died leaving him and his 'near brother' alone, said brother finally starts getting some attention from the girl he's been chasing for years and has less time with him.

His next best friend is on the outs because his stupid comments nearly got him and someone else dead, he's probably being approached by terrorists and then a few years later, his brother dies, his 'adoptive' brother is murdered and when he catches the person responsible for the latter, he's caught in an explosion that might have rained body parts on him, breaks down and winds up in hell on earth. Ten years he spends with wraiths pumping out a dread aura that leaves him a choice of go insane or retreat into a dog's mind.

He gets out and murder is all he can think of for most of a year. Murder and protection. A year after missing the chance to finish what he tried to start years earlier, his godson goes through hell and he's then stuck in one of his most hated places with remnants of those who tortured him growing up.

Sirius is bound to be a 'bit broken'. He likely never did get to properly grow up, and even if he did he potentially lost it due to what happened. He almost certainly never saw a trauma counsellor. Hell, Harry never did in spite of killing in self defence or defence of others, facing monsters, dementors, torture or seeing his school mates murdered in front of him.

** I mean James was definitely a jerk in OOTP. His dickishness pales in comparison to Snape (since you bring him up I mean).

You have very little info on what James was like this was the only scene with him. As far as the books go you really have no idea what he was like in school beyond this scene or how much he changed ( or didn't) after this scene. You just have several very biased perspectives on him.

However I think people focus less on James because the books hold him accountable. The narrative while it forgives him doesn't dismiss him. Sirius and Remus struggle to defend his actions in the memory. Lilly and Harry both call him out and the narrative vindicates them for that.

But Snape? As far as the narrative goes Harry has very mixed feelings about Snape. Then he sees Snape's memories and in the end he names a kid after Snape as a result. He is seen as redeemed in Harry's eyes good enough to name a kid after and be proud of.

These memories while supposed to illustrate Snape's mourning and his love for Lilly. This love is what redeems him. It guides his every action its what makes him change sides. And thats the problem. Because his love wasn't enough to make him care that joining a hate group that wanted to genocide muggleborns would hurt the one he claimed to love.

It wasn't enough to care about her happiness, her desires, her well being. Which is why he goes to Voldemort to spare her in exchange for the child instead of going to Dumbledore right away when he knows her child is being targeted. And why he can rip the letter and the picture keeping the love she meant to give to others for himself.

This is not how the narrative chose to depict these memories . This is the interpretation and arguments fans come up with to counter the framing the narrative gives these scenes. And its why Snape's misdeeds I think are talked about so much. Because the narrative doesn't hold him accountable the way it holds say James accountable, or Voldemort, or Umbridge. This is the counter to the narrative. James being an asshole? Is not.

** Children can be cruel little shits. No doubts about that. Doesn't mean they can't grow up, become better, heck maybe even be sorry for having been such jerks.

As for Snape ... he was a cruel, vindictive little shit himself who often brought out the worst in others. Besides that I'm fairly sure he hit back as hard as he got.

*** eh, I hate James yet I don't ship Snily. I guess I just hate bullies, even fictional ones because I was bullied in school and James was described as a bully in canon.

Snily is between my most hated pairings actually. right next to tommary.
