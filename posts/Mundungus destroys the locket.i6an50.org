Mundungus was an experienced thief. A very experienced thief. He started his career as a curse breaker before quickly finding out that he'd make a massively larger amount doing things by himself rather than with a group, and targeting places people still lived rather than places that had already been mostly looted to the ground.

So when he found the very pretty locket with very heavy curses on it, he destroyed it with a small controlled blast of fiendfire. There's a certain level of cursed that starts being lethal, after all, and selling things that kill the person you sold them to isn't good for return customers. Bloody horcruxes, ruining perfectly good jewellery by making it so you have to destroy them to get rid of the soul fragment.

The house elf left him alone after that, for some reason. Probably something to do with respecting dark magic or some rot.

AN: and so the locket is destroyed, completely derailing the events of the last book. So what next? Do the trio go looking for mundungus anyway? Do they acquire the use of an experienced thief and also a person who can destroy horcruxes? Or do they just go "oh well, job done" and continue to the next one? Just a side note: they have no reason to visit the ministry as it stands now, the locket not being there. But do they go anyway to spy?


** Hmm... That depends, on how good he actually is. If he has all that skill, but also keeps the outwards appearance from canon, without being discovered, then he'd be just dismissed as useless, disloyal scum. And someone with that skillset would be wary of revealing himself to a bunch of brats with no information security and self preservation instincts of a well-caffeinated rodent.

I'd like to think that Dumbledore would know, but part of - encrypted - inheritance from Dumbledore containing the information for his successor/instructions for Dung gets stopped by the Ministry for political reasons, without ever knowing what they actually have.

That would leave Dung as an independent agent, responsible for several miracles and table-turns, but credited for none of them. With his primary contact with OotP gone blasting off from Astronomy tower, he'd have less contact with the Order and be one of the most distrusted in the wake of Snape's treachery, but also not considered a real thread or someone to monitor.

Mundungus Fletcher, Master Curse Breaker, accomplished liberator of hidden valuables and the best charms specialist this side of Hogwarts would do his thing, unknown and unseen, with no interruptions or greenhorns to babysit. Just the way he liked it.
