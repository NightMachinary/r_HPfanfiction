I'll read almost any ship, but my favorites are Harry/Hermione, Draco/Hermione and any Marauder/Hermione. Ideally I'd love suggestions over 300k words but anything over 100k words is okay. TIA

*One Hundred and Sixty Nine*, linkffn(8581093), is another great Marauder/Hermione story.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord.

** Check out the author Shayalonnie on FFN. The one work by her I'm always recommending is linkffn(the debt of time by Shayalonnie) which is mainly Hermione/Sirius, but has Hermione/Remus.

She's written a Hermione/James, and is currently writing a Hermione/Neville and (separate) Hermione/Remus. Tying the Nott is with Theodore, but I believe that ones on a back burner.

If you don't mind the idea of Hermione/Snape, check the author Loten on FFN.

Edit: oh I think linkffn(looks can be deceiving by corvusdraconus) fits, at 450k+ words. It's Hermione/Viktor.

The author colubrina on FFN writes Dramione and Tomione, with some other ships. A good number are over 150k words, though none over 300k I think.

I'm pretty sure she's stopping around chapter 170ish for the first part and then continuing it in another section so that there's a good ending point for people who want to quit reading.
