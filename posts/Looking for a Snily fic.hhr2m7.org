:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hello! I am very new at this so I'm sorry is this just sounds like random rambling. I have tried posting to Ao3 for help finding this fic, but have gotten no results. Someone told me to try on here and see if anyone knew the work I was talking about.

I believe the work was a Lily/Severus fic where Severus went back in time after he died. He may have also met Dumbledore(?) before he came back at kings cross. He came back right before the “mudblood” incident, like literally just before he said the words, and he eventually got together with Lily. Years later when he and Lily have a son (maybe named Sebastian? I'm not sure), his mother is babysitting the son while Severus and Lily are out, when Voldie comes to kill the son (the prophecy is still a thing) and Sev's mother dies instead of Lily, making Sev and Lily's son the boy who lived, and Severus and Lily get to raise their son.

Some other details I remember was sev changing his appearance, sev throwing his father out of their house, sev never joining the death eaters, and for some reason people selling trinkets to others proclaiming the trinkets to protect them from the coming war and lily and sev saying how ridiculous it was.

Any help would be much appreciated! I really loved the fic and wanted to read it again!


** This might be linkffn(Severus Snape and the Second Chance), but I'm not totally sure. It does start at mudblood and the fic has his mother take Lily's place in the BWL debacle. There's /a lot/ of Snily Peggy Sue fics.

*** I don't think that one's it; he goes back to a minute or two earlier, at the start of the confrontation, not the very moment before.

Which Snily Peggy Sue fics have you read? I really liked the writing quality in Come Once Again and Love Me, though not the amount of swearing, and it handled the consequences of the Shrieking Shack incident very well. I preferred The Peace Not Promised, though, especially the slow but more or less steady growth of their relationship and seeing him work with Dumbledore to win the war Slytherin-style. Started to read Severus Snape and the Art of War, but put it down when Lily sneaked off with Severus to smoke cigarettes she'd stolen; I didn't enjoy that characterisation.

**** Those are the Snily Peggy Sue fics I've read in addition to Severus Snape and the Second Chance linked before. Keep in mind that I don't think all of them are good. This trope is used more than probably every other (non-oneshot) Snily premises combined, except the implicit Snily in biological Severitus which I don't really count.

linkffn(The Peace Not Promised; Severus Snape and the Art of War; The Apprentice; His Greatest Wish; Second Start by 8thweasleykid; The Moment it Began; Cauldrons and Lillies; Come Once Again and Love Me; Million, Billion, Trillion; Second chance, a new choice; Chalk Outline).

And these are the other Marauder-era Snape Peggy Sue fics I've read that either has minor non-endgame Snily (They Didn't Know We Were Seeds) or isn't Snily at all (the others). linkffn(They Didn't Know We Were Seeds; No Strings).

My favorite Snily Peggy Sue fic is The Peace Not Promised (for basically the reasons you stated, incidentally). It's the fic that got me into Snily permanently beyond a passing interest after reading some Snape fics. I think the one I've seen recommended the most is Come Once Again and Love Me but I found the fic too heavy on the angst for my tastes. I adored Art of War's non-Hogwarts scenes but I think the characterisation of Snape could have been better in that fic (he's too nice in it).

  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.

  Shelley Fabares once said, "I was dying but suddenly had a second chance at living." What would you give to go back and fix your youthful mistakes? Can one really rewrite the past? Oh, and there is a catch. Your memories fade. Difficult? Yes. Impossible? Let's try. Here is the story of one surely potions prodigy who tries to do just that.
