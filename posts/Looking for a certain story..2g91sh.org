I only read the first chapter and then went somewhere with the intention of reading the rest of it, but I can't find it again. I can't remember the name, and it's definitely not on TVtropes, and I've even tried all the relevant filters on ff.net.

So, it begins right after the end of OotP with Voldemort ordering Snape to kill Bellatrix and she hits Voldie with something nasty and runs for it and flees to Dumbledore where he makes her take the unbreakable vow and uses veritaserum to question a bunch of things. Like how she's not really interested in helping the order but doing this to selfishly stay alive, how she's not sorry she killed Sirius, only sorry he's a blood traitor, etc.

It was interesting because most Bellatrix-fights-for-good stories make her disgustingly innocent and victimized, instead of unapologetically cold.

So can anyone find this?

*** Yes, very. I just finished all available chapters. Sadly, I think it's abandoned but that didn't stop me (I just glance at the info at the top of the page in case of spoilers and I saw it was last updated in 2011) and it's very good.

No obvious spelling or grammar mistakes, all the characters seem faithful to their book counterparts, it's believable, etc. I hope it's updated again.
