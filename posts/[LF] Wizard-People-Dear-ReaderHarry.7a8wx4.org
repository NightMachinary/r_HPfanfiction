Are there any stories floating around out there that feature the Harry Potter from [[https://youtu.be/xjYPfOnuf9w][Wizard People Dear Reader]]? (If you haven't watched this, you should, because it's hilarious.) Anyway, I'm looking for any stories based off of this character. Bonus points if they include the flamboyant narration and hilarious character names.
