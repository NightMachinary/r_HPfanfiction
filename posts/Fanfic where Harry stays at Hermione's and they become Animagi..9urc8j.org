I don't know if the story has been taken down, but I remember reading it and loving it. But I can't remember the name, can anyone help me?

Edit: I remember the first chapter being that of Harry recovering from the cruciatus curse, and that they end up sleeping together though it remains kind of unsaid until much later into the story.


** That's almost certainly Vox Corporis, by Miss Ann Thropic. It has been taken down from the usual spots, but there are copies hosted hither and yon. Google it and you'll find one of the pdfs.

** While not that exact fic, if you particularly liked the 'Harry stay with Hermione and is animagi' plot point then I think you'd like [this] ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus]])
