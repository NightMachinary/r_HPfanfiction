** I haven't really read much of that story just for the reason that the smut and rune magic completely threw off the pacing and general feel of the entire fic for me. In regards to the chapter you linked i don't think it's racist but rather the author seems to be forcing his religious views on the reader and using Harry as a mouthpiece.

It's actually rather cringeworthy to read but it's their fic and they can do what they want.

What really grind my nerves was that it wasn't even plot relevant. I remember a scene in Rise of the Wizards, where muslims do a terrorist attack. It didn't bother me because I knew that it had a purpose.

You seem unclear on what freedom of speech actually means. If it's limited, it's not freedom.

** For Love of Magic is a perfect example of a fic where the author attempts to make Harry look smart by turning him into a mouthpiece for the author's thoughts on life, the universe, and everything. Unfortunately, by doing this the author inadvertently makes Harry sound like an idiot.

** Since when are Muslims and Christians RACES? It may be anti-religious (which IMHO is pretty good, this world is supporting religions too much as it is by handing the religious advantages (certain countries even say that all atheists are terrorists and lock them up!) and privileges (in Germany students are forced into religous studies classes and if they don't want to attend, then they have to take ethics class which is always at very inconvenient times (almost never at the same time the other students have religous studies!), not to mention that religious studies class is more than biased in favor of Christianity!) - despite them causing some of the biggest problems of our times: Terrorism and wars! Without religions there would be no Muslim terrorists!), but:

IT IS NOT RACIST!

ps: Blacks, Caucausians, Asians etc. - those are races! (or rather - IMHO: Sub-Races, because all of them are HUMAN!)

Thats not racism, mate.

The lines you mean, I guess are these:

#+begin_quote
  Eypt was an Islamic country and Harry despised Islam just like he despised Christianity - they were basically the same thing after all - but Islam had not undergone the same reformation that Christianity had and religion still had its slimy tentacles wrapped around every facet of people's lives in Islamic countries.

** The story just states a characters opinion on religion, keeping in mind that the story is set in a fictional world where a completely different set of rules apply. The author could be-planning on having harry be right. Your complaint is stupid and invalid. For all we know in the next chapter harry could find out that the all the monotheistic religions were wrong but the polytheistic ones were partially correct. you have to keep context in mind.
