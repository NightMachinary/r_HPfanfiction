** well, you are probably inspired by the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/mmrwi3/prompt_harry_had_to_get_back_before_midnight_in/][top post on the sub right now]] so there are some good comments on that one. I read one just like that accept it was Harry/Hermione so you probably dont want to read that one
