So after reading about how 'The Life He Leads' by GeneralStarfox would've continued I wondered: Are there any stories in which people are somehow thrown forwards in time?

I feel like there's potentially a lot that could be done with such a scenario. As opposed to travelling backwards, the characters would have almost no useful knowledge to take advantage from, they stumble into a world where they did exist in the past and are remembered but just vanished from one day and might even face resentment from the ones left behind. Just imagine if Harry blacks out during the infamous graveyard scene, wakes up to a new morning and a new decade to face a world ruled by a fully recovered Voldemort who had years to strengthen his power. Some people might be happy he actually didn't die, people may be hopeful because of the prophecy and their savior is back or blame him because without him it was impossible to stand a chance, and Harry's still just a teenager halfway through school with no real training wishing he could reconnect to the people who've now lived for years without him. On the other hand, his knowledge might still come in useful. Let's say the jump happens in sixth year and in the following years Voldemort might have taken extra care to obscure his Horcruxes. Suddenly Harry could be the only one to still know about them.

I'm just rambling, so tl&dr; just wondering if that's been done


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855): Harry first traveled back to 1975, then midway through the story, he and Bellatrix got catapulted 21+ years to December 1997 again.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

*** I know I've read that story and yet I somehow managed to completely delete the forward-in-time-part from my memory. Huh.
