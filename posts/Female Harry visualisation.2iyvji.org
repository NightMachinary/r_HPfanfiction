**** Nah. I think she would be too, too pretty.

I don't have a source, but I believe J.K. Rowling remarked on this at one point in time. Although she is happy with the actors, she was saddened that they were all so attractive, because part of the story is the imperfection. I believe this was especially true with Emma Watson - who had all the characteristics of Hermione, except for the imperfect appearance.

*** I could never decide. Would he look more like his mother, his father (like Myrtle above) or maybe have some of the "Black family looks" from Dorea Black-Potter. (Which is the style of what I think OP's picture is. Doesn't look like James (why would a girl look like her father anyway?) Doesn't look like Lily, but sort of pale with pronounced cheekbones and dark hair, all that.

***** Same here! I look like my dad and have his features, but I have the vibe of my mom, if you understand what I'm trying to say. Individually, all my features resemble mostly my father's. Taken as a whole, I end up looking like my mother, as well.

**** I think when it's a kid favoring the opposite sex parent you generally say the kid favors that parent. It's pretty easy to put your foot in your mouth if you say to some girl that she looks just like her dad.

**** I started writing a fic years ago where girl!Harry was a literal inversion of Harry, Red hair, brown eyes, etc. The result I had for Petunia was that while Vernon and Dudley were slightly worse to her because she was a girl, Petunia would sometimes secretly gift things to "Heather"

Nothing huge and nothing new, but for slightly worse treatment, she had slightly more freedom, and as a result, fought with Dudley a lot more often. I don't think I cleared 4 chapters, but when they eventually got to Snape he was going to ignore her as hard as he could, never make eye contact, especially since he saw James' eyes staring out of Lily's face. I should pick it up again at some point, I just hate my own writing lol

** I always imagine both male and female variants with dead eyes/a thousand yard stare after the first year.

Also, a female Harry would look noticeably harder than a normal teenage girl, sporting more than a few scars and a more muscular body than normal-a side-effect of the Dursley chores not being any different despite their nominal attitude being more relaxed towards a female than another male household member as well as the whole 'help me, I wanna live' aspect of things.

Basically, by the time female Harry hits fifth year, she has short hair to avoid someone pulling on it and nailing her from behind, sports a lot of scars due to various (mis)adventures, has the body of a fitness fanatic (because no wand + not allowed to fight= run away fast was a lesson she learned early on) and a slightly feral gaze to her.

Basically, sexy? Eh, it's not like she has the time for that sort of stuff anyway what with everyone trying to kill her and all that. If she survives, then maybe she'll consider it-unless she needs to go the Alastor Moody route afterwards in order to stay alive.

**** Mainly due to headcanon. The key difference between the male and female Harrys would occur prior to Hogwarts, namely their respective treatment by the Dursleys. I picture female harry as having to put up with a lot less in terms of hardships from the perspective of food & bedding arrangements, though she experiences the same problems otherwise. No idea why, it's just what I believe.
