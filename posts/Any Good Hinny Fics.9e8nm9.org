I don't really care much if it's a slow burn or not, but I would like the Fanfic to me around 30+ chapters and they have to be finished. No Ron bashing.


** There's always northumbrian's or [[/u/floreatcastellum]]'s fics if you somehow haven't had them recommended to you yet.

** There is a giant megathread of H/G fics [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HarryandGinny/comments/97pyou/harryginny_fanfiction_megathread/][here]]; there is bound to be some that fit what your are looking for.

My favorite completed H/G fic is probably [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5435295/1/The-Bonds-of-Blood][The Bonds of Blood]].
