all the sirius black/oc fics I know are set during the marauders era but are there any set after the events of POA that you can recommend? And preferably a fic that isn't a continuation of one set in the marauders era too.


** linkffn(the lives we touch) I think he's kind of a jerk in this one though, but it's been a while since i've read it
