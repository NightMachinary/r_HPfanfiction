I think these fics are super fun and light reading and want to find more of them. Any ship is fine. My favorites so far are both Drarry ( linkao3(344335), linkao3(3178065) ), but I am open to whatever if it is good, angsty, and well written.


** Since you read Draco/Harry, have you been to Apple Ling's link page? There is a category for Party Games -> [[https://www.diigo.com/list/applelingrecs/Party+Games/1hynwb2w4][Here]].

Another story I've read (and am following) is Eros and Psyche (mostly Draco/Hermione but heavily features other pairings as well) - linkffn(6200937)

Thanks for the link! Also I have read Eros and Psyche (idk why I didn't mention it before) but there were only a couple pairings I actually liked, so I skipped a ton of the chapters. It's good though!

  It started with the spin of a bottle, and now Harry and Draco have gotten themselves so far into their own game there's almost no way out again. Except to keep playing.

  Harry felt Malfoy's breath on his lips as they came together over the bottle, hands firmly planted on the floor as though they each needed their familiar soil, refusing to cross into enemy territory.   Except that Malfoy no longer felt like his enemy.   Malfoy felt inevitable.

** Linkffn(the eighth year) hopefully this links the right one. The author is holz followed by several numbers I can't remember. Light and fluffy for the most part, HP/DG and HG/DM, Ron is an ass but maybe kinda gets a little better. Eventually.

  COMPLETELY REWRITTEN: No longer starts as canon, it is completely non-canon. AND I AM NOW CONTINUING THE STORY - The trio return for an 8th year at Hogwarts. House unity is promoted, new relationships and friendships blossom and because Harry Potter is involved, it is definitely not a quiet year! M for sexual themes, violence and swearing!

** The only 8th year fic I've read that I really liked was linkffn(charms can't fix us by Cordelia McGonagall) but it's been a while since I've read it. I recall there being social aspects, but I /don't/ think there were actual parties and such. But it does potentially fit that angsty bit you want!

  The war is over and Hogwarts still stands. A few "eighth years" choose to come back to finish their schooling in peace, to mentor war-weary children, and to patch together the ends of their teenage years. Hermione learns what she was missing while out with Harry and Ron, Neville flexes his newfound confidence, Parvati brews a perfect Amortentia, and Draco lets go. "M" to be safe.
