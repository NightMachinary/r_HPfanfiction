I've just finished Australia (post DH, Ron pov) and Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness (during DH, Neville pov). I'd like to find an equivalently good, lengthy Hermione-centric work. Any genre is okay as long as it's canon and not too overly dramatic---Australia had about as much internal dialogue as I can handle.

My favorite things about the aforementioned works were that they were both in-canon and in-character, providing new insights into the magical world as well as the narrator & supporting characters. Those are the essential qualities I'm looking for.

While I find rationalist FF as cathartic as anybody, staying canon is really key. Or at least as canon as DAYoD. (Seriously, how they explain Snape away, I don't understand. Reading the sequel now; maybe it will address things.)

Humor fic is okay as long as it's a genuinely compelling story; most that I've read so far is entertaining but either a re-write, non-canon or satirical.


** Three flavors of Hermione-centric fics:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][The Arithmancer]] is Hermione's POV where she's a maths genius which translates over to Arithmancy and spell creation. The tone and genre are pretty close to canon.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or][Applied Cultural Anthropology]] is a bit darker, edgier Hermione-in-Slytherin fic, although it does a great job preserving Hermione's essential character.

[[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=661&chapno=1][Hermione, Queen of Witches]] is light and fluffy and follows canon exactly. It's diary format, where Hermione writes to a sentient diary a la Riddle, except it's a /good/ diary. I read this a long time ago but I think it was decent, if extremely light. It's long, too, covering the entirety of years 1-4.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1994264/Vera-Rozalsky][Vera Rozalsky's]] Four o'clock in the Morning (complete) or Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation (in-progress) are both good, long-form Hermione POV stories that are almost entirely canon-compliant and are set post-DH. Be warned, Amends includes some BDSM kink (though you can skip it and still enjoy the story) and both feature Draco, though not in a heavy-handed or implausible way.

*** Wow, they really made the Weasley's (and Ron in particular) look like huge assholes. Really OOC.

**** Ron gets better, though I agree he swings a bit OOC at the beginning of Amends. And not sure how far you read but there's a subplot in Amends that goes a ways towards explaining Ginny.

As for the rest I suspect the author was influenced by this pair of essays: [[http://www.redhen-publications.com/weasleys.html][one]] [[http://www.redhen-publications.com/molly.html][two]]

It's a take that I don't personally agree with, but it is at least plausible based on canon. Just very uncharitable.

***** On a meta level, it seems to me that if you want to split up Ron and Hermione in a Hermione-sympathetic story you pretty much have to make Ron at least a little bit OOC, otherwise why wouldn't they stay together?
