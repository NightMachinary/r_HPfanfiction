I just made a long discussion thread for this subreddit but when I posted it, nothing came out. I'm pretty miffed about it since I spent a long time writing it and now it's just gone. Is there a way for me to retrieve it, at least?

It's not on my post history.


** If you have under a certain karma level your post will need to be manually approved by subreddit mods. This helps combat spam. Maybe that's what happened?
