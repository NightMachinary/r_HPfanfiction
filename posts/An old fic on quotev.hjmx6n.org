:END:
Hello!

I know its probably been deleted or no one else knows what fic I'm on about but....

In about 2012 to 2014 I read a fic on quotev that was tom riddle era and focused on an oc called Avalyn or something similar if I remember correctly. The first page was avalyn walking down a hallway and meeting Harry Potter and I think she tried to kill him. The next chapter was then back in Tom's time. Avalyn and tom formed a sort of relationship and avalyn had a small group of people to follow her as well. I think I remember a name of a follower called Charlotte? I remember a chapter was named Lacero as well. In the chapter im pretty sure tom and avalyn talk about horcruxes and avalyn uses lacero as a curse to make a cut on her hand.

God I hope someone will be able to help me. I've been trying to find it since I got rid of my quotev account in 2014. I bet its deleted but hopefully someone will be able to help:)
