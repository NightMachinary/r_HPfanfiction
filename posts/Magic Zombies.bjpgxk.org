So without anything supernatural going on, zombies really suck as a credible (or even physically feasible) threat.

A few reasons why they don't work and are super lame:

- Senses. How the hell can they know what's going on when their ears are falling off, eyes are full of cataracts, and nose shaved off?

- Digestion. Where does it go? Day Z said they explode, but then there wouldn't be that many left...

- Decomposition. Heat rots flesh, bugs and other nasties love that shit. How the hell can they even walk around for longer than a couple days on a hot week? A baseball bat should crush them like craft paper, hell even a small cut should fester and take them down fast.

- General impairment. If their muscles are degenerating, how can they even break a window? How can they think their way out of a trap? How can they not freeze and thaw in winter?

Anyway, I guess this was a long-ish way of asking if there are any good HP zombie fics, that get around all these issues ('cause magic)?


** Love in a Time of the Zombie Apocalypse by Rizzle. I'm not sure if its exactly what you're looking for, but it's the only zombie fiction I've liked so far.

#+begin_quote
  The war between humans and zombies rages even after five years. Military efforts to repel the hordes of undead prove less than entirely effective. A team of military medical specialists are brought together to try and find a solution. They are joined, however, by some unexpected participants. The survival of humanity rests in what emerges from the meetings. (First Tale)

** I'm thinking maybe "A cure for magic" by emmaficready (both on ff and ao3) might catch your interest. I found the cause of the zombie outbreak to be a nice take.
