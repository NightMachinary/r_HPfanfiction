Everybody knows how controversial Aurelius Dumbledore is but here I am trying to think of a way that it all works and is also interesting enough that it would be a nice reveal rather than a lame one.

First thing to realize is that we know very little about Kendra Dumbledore. What we do know is all second-hand information colored by people's perception of her.

I postulate that she wasn't as good-hearted, kind and loving as she may seem at first glance.

#+begin_quote
  Muriel: "...a terrifying woman, simply terrifying. Muggle-born, though I heard she pretended otherwise ---"
#+end_quote

Though this is from the gossiping Muriel, it paints a picture of someone that atleast did care for appearances. It doesn't seem very unlikely either by her actions in which she managed to keep Arianna's condition hidden.

#+begin_quote
  Elphias Doge: "She never pretended anything of the sort! Kendra was a fine woman."
#+end_quote

Of course, outside of gossip, people thought of her as a fine upstanding member of society. Strange perception for a recluse?

#+begin_quote
  I knew my brother, Potter. He learned secrecy at our mother's knee. Secrets and lies, that's how we grew up...
#+end_quote

Secrets and lies, that's how she raised her children. It could just be because of Arianna but I suspect that such was her very nature. A person with young Albus's personality without all the talent and power.

What I say from here on out does not have any basis in Canon that I can find but nothing that contradicts it either.

I think Kendra too had aspirations of greatness. Born to a muggle family she was at the bottom of the barrel but with her marriage and her behavior she climbed the ladder. I suspect that while she loved her children, a part of her also resented Ariana.

A bit of personal touch here, but while I too love my grandfather who has Parkinson's disease, in dark moments I resent him too. When I can't meet my friends, can't go to the party, can't leave for more than 10 minutes because I have to take care of him I resent him. I sometimes find myself wondering if I would feel relieved when he died.... But I digress. My point is that it isn't impossible that Kendra had these feelings too. And its worse for her because if everything went as it should then Arianna would outlive her.

Despite all of this I wasn't too convinced until I read the etymology of her name. It may seem a stretch but we all know how important names are in J.K. Rowling's story telling.

#+begin_quote
  Kendra is a name of disputed origin. It may come from Anglo-Saxon meaning "understanding, knowledge". It may be a variation of the English name Kenda, meaning "water baby", or Dakota, meaning "magical power". Alternatively, it may come from the name Kendrick, which is either derived from Welsh for "greatest champion" or Anglo-Saxon for "family ruler".
#+end_quote

Yes, the one I am focusing on is Kenda meaning "water baby"

What if Kendra went on to birth Credence and decided to leave to America or asked her sister to take Credence so she can live her life freely? Harry thought she looked Native American which may be why Credence was leaving for America.

(Its just a basic idea in the end. I do firmly believe that the answer to Aurelius Dumbledore's existence lies with Kendra even if the answer isn't exactly what I have thought of.)


** even if she did fake her death Credence Barebone would not be a dumbledore then

as the dumbledore name would have came from Percival so while credence would be related to the dumbledores from sharing a mother

he himself would not be a dumbledore

*** Honestly, that's at best a technicality that I'm not sure Grindelwald would care about when emphasizing that Albus is Credence's brother.

At worst, I didn't really put much thought into it.

** Besides, if it's just that Grindelwald was lying then I can already see all the indy!Credence fics where he figures it out in a second and then punishes stupid old Grindelwald.

** Or, Percival didn't die in Azkaban and somehow had a child. It would be harder for Kendra to fake her death since someone had to attend her funeral but it's been a while since I reread DH, but I think they said they just dumped his body in the sea

*** But since Percival went so far for her daughter as to attack muggles and then go to Azkaban without telling why he did it, it would seem very, very weird if he didn't come to Ariana if he was free in 1901.

I can't find anything about her funeral on the wiki and I plan to reread Deathly Hallows soon. Only thing I can find confirms that Albus wasn't there for her death and she may have already been "buried" before he returned.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Chapter 18 (The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore) - It is stated that Albus Dumbledore received an owl informing him of Kendra's death shortly after he left Hogwarts in mid-June 1899.

  After Kendra's death, the cause of which "nobody ever seemed sure" (according to Muriel)

**** I was referring to Percival's body. But that's a good point, since Albus and Aberforth were at school it was possible Kendra did fake her death. And Jo doesn't just leave details like that for no reason. Still, Ariana and Kendra would have been dead by the time Percival would have died anyway.

***** Yeah, I realized that as soon as I replied and removed that bit about the body.

** im confused what makes you think that

#+begin_quote
  [she] decided to leave to America
#+end_quote

When she lived and died in England and why you think that

#+begin_quote
  [she] asked her sister to take Credence so she can live her life freely?
#+end_quote

When she spent the rest of her life not free but trapped raising Ariana

*** That paragraph in particular is total What if territory. If you read over my post again then I was forming a personality of Kendra from Canon resources to show that my hypothesis that Kendra would fake her death to separate herself from the burden of Ariana isn't completely preposterous.

I understand it's a bit farfetched right now but I think that this could be where the story goes.

Anyway, maybe I will edit my post when I get home to make it more easy to understand.

** I've always liked the idea that credence is related to grindelwald likely as son/grandson, something. It would make sense why grindelwad said everything he did was for credence (assuming it was true of course)
