** They're a boarding school. It's easy.

Isolate the dorms for two weeks, with a portrait or teacher or prefect in each of the younger ones for supervision.

Then consider the school a single household. As long as there is no one coming in to the school, they should be fine.

** Ignore it.

Wizards generally dont interact with muggles.

the muggle borns who do have it would be isolated.

and then school would resume as normal

*** Also I am sure that majority if not all of mundane illnesses are fixable by potions. In coronavirus case specifically, I am almost 100% sure it is rapidly curable with Pepperup Potion.\\
Edit: Thanks, whoever gave silver for my humble trivia.

** Lets see. The great hall would be be closed and all food would likely be eaten in the dorms. They would probably move to a two week time table, split the classes into smaller classes so the students would have more off days giving them a lower chance to catch it if half of the class is stuck in their beds when not in class that day.
