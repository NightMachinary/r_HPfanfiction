  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

**** I disagree. People call it inventive because it overcomplicates magic and adds a hidden meaning to every single thing that happens, it isn't inventive, so much as it's glaringly overlayered with exposition to the point of being downright terrible at times. Not to mention the whole !SlytherinHarry from a light family manages to befriend every Slytherin who isn't Draco Malfoy trope.

***** Overcomplicates relative to... what? A ridiculously sparse and inconsistent baseline?

While there are some places where I'd agree with you (the house elves' battle, for example), for the most part I found that the additions to the baseline filled in canon, rather than simply adding something for the sake of being clever. A perfect example of that is the augmentation of the Horcrux ritual, which in-canon is ill-defined and sort of inconsistent with the fact that wizards have been killing each other for ages. Some authors have tried to make it as horrific as Dumbledore and Slughorn allude to by making the whole thing ritualistic, adding some element of torture, some prerequisite on the victim (age, 'purity') etc, but to me those have felt like variations in degree, at best. By adding in the whole state of mind requirement, this author really neatly differentiates it from something that mostly equivalent to a single murder, and really makes the whole thing horrific in a way no other fanfic I've read has been able to do so. And it's not like the state of mind as a prerequisite for certain kinds of magics is completely new either - patronus requite it, after all - this author just makes a connection nobody else has made.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
