Ron is cheating on Hermione and keeps it hidden. She discovers it and challenge him, but he refuse the betrayal. She decides to make him pay by sleeping with another Guy. Draco is with his Wife but from time to time catches a glimpse of Hermione and realize that she developed into an attractive Woman over the Years. He is attracted to her and gladly sleeps with her to give his former Rival a Lesson. However, while for Hermione its just Sex, Malfoy might develop more feelings for her (he doesnt leave his Wife, because the forbidden Nature is tempting him) so he has a double life.

If this is to detailed i would accept an unmarried Draco (his conditions about discovering her attractivity wont change) or that Hermione sleeps with any other Guy.

the same scenarios would go for Harry/Ginny.
