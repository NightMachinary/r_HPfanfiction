Ive seen a fic where harry had a pet bassilisk and i am currently very into the idea kf harry owning some kind of awesor dangerous pet especially if a lot of people dont like that he has it or think it's dangerous. I really enjoyed seeing dumbledore and the wizarding world freak out over the pet bassilisk. Does anyone have any good recommendations? Maybe something with him having a lethifold or sphynx?


** Back in the day, it was all the rage to give Harry a kitten, only for the kitten to grow up and actually be a nundu. Luckily that trope seems to have died, but you could probably find some of those old stories if you can stomach looking through thousands of generic indy!harry fics. from 2005-2009

**** Pretty much was. They could never actually write it correctly, so all it did was become wank for how cool Harry was.

I'd have liked to see a few where his magical pet grows up and suddenly isn't a little kitten anymore, and Harry can't control it. That'd lead to some pretty cool stuff.

**** Since Hermione is an enormous bibliophile, I refuse to believe that she never encountered the phenomenon that is velociraptor, one of the most popular dinosaurs known to man. Admittedly, a decent amount of this comes from the Jurassic Park film, which was released in 1993 (PoA), two years after this scene... but still, the fact that she even says that raptors are birds is just painful, because the author is practically pointing out how dumb they made her here. Especially considering the animal in question should be covered in /feathers, notably unlike a dragon/.

** So... I can't help but wonder how that would actually work, keeping a basilisk as a pet. Would it have to wear a hood, like a hunting falcon? Then again, basilisks are kind of on a level with really dumb and possibly psychotic humans in the Potterverse, so... is it really a pet, or a friend at that point? If it's staying with you unwillingly, is it a prisoner? I would argue that it is, even if it legally does not possess 'being' rights. Sphynx, same question, only much smarter and fond of riddles. Like... if you have a 'pet' sphynx, what would that even mean? It has violent tendencies that may include eating people, and is too smart to be treated like an ordinary 'pet', so really, it's more like having a flatmate at that point. Or a moocher who sleeps on your couch, and requires to be fed a sheep three times per week, because they /could/ do that themselves, but that sounds like effort, and they'd probably leave bits of Neville in your bed. Or they catch their own food, sometimes talk to you, and it's very much like having a friend who happens to be a psychotic man-eating catperson.

Point being that some 'beasts' are actually worryingly intelligent, and keeping them as a 'pet' would be more like hosting a member of an alien race to share your dorm room. I can't help but think of Hagrid and Aragog, because Acromantulas are obviously sapient, again, but are treated mostly as if they are not by the world at large. If you keep one as a 'pet', you're basically owning an individual that is capable of reasoning by itself. It's not slavery, legally, but it's damn close.

Lethifolds seem more like a 'keep in a glass tank and occasionally feed' kind of pet, at the best of times. I'm not even sure what would be necessary to 'tame' one, because they're incredibly violent and view you as food, so maybe it'd need to be raised from a... whatever an infant lethifold is called? I can't think of any way having it would matter to a plot. Maybe I'm putting too much thought into what it would mean to keep a magical pet, idk, but most of these seem impractical, not overly interesting, or dubious on the whole 'pet vs person' thing. At least the velociraptor wasn't smart enough to talk :/

** The author [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/Saras_Girl/pseuds/Saras_Girl][Saras_Girl]] writes tons of weird/cool pets into all her fics. She pretty much only does slash (and mostly Drarry) but her fics are awesome. In TURN, Harry has two different snakes and one is magical. In Helix, he and Draco have a frost snail as a pet (and it's magical in some weird ways and its slime is used for potions IIRC). In All of Life is Yours to Miss, Draco has a huge beetle from a transfiguration accident.

Also, in [[http://www.thehexfiles.net/viewstory.php?sid=3386][Secrets]] by Vorabiza, Harry has a set of four magical snakes with really cool powers. Personally I didn't like that fic all that much, but the snakes are pretty badass.

Edited to add- also in [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/979182/chapters/1927380][Cartographers Craft]] (a really cool fic where a 16y/o Sirius comes out of the marauders map in 1997), Harry has a Phoenix.
