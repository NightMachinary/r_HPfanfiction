:END:
So there's this one Dramione fanfic that I was thinking about, but I can't remember what it was called. Hermione and Draco get together /somehow/, and I think they have sort of a back and forth relationship for a while? But anyway, then this book from the restricted section falls and Draco get trapped for like a week. He has to go through these trials with this monster lady or some shit to get out of the book. He gets back to Hermione exhausted and starved, and he's got these cuts on his arm that he made to keep himself awake in one of the trials. Then after he eats I think, Hermione sees the cuts and does them to herself with the same knife, then they kinda go crazy, biting and scratching each other, which makes some kind of soul bond between them? It's less weird in the fic. Also, Harry and Ron totally reject Hermione's relationship with Draco.

Sorry for the run on sentences, lol. It was on ffn I think, but I can't remember.
