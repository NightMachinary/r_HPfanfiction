I'm currently picking at this idea for a story. It is very AU, to put it mildly. I won't get into the details of it right here, because it's not terribly relevant just yet. It's getting to the point where I'm starting to wonder if I might not be better off just writing an original story with the same premise.

It's a problem I've often faced with my betas actually. I'll come up with this wild idea, which I'm really excited about, only for them to go, 'Meh, it's too AU, you might as well write an original story instead'. Which I admit kinda kills my excitement for various reasons. Mostly I think it comes down to them not being as excited about the idea as I am.

Regardless. I'm trying to get a read on where the average fan falls on the question of what's too AU? What are some definite lines that have you saying 'that is too AU'? What are your thoughts?


** It's too AU for me when a story has nothing to do with any Harry Potter character and does not have a magic system that allows for a vast amount of possibilities. If you have those two then go wild all you want. You want to write a Xianxia style fanfic where wizards live ona separate planet a million times the size of Earth with a population numbering in the trillions with each wizard capable of leveling up to be able to live a hundred thousand times longer than our own universe has been around for? Go ahead.

*** I think you're right in that the characters and the magic system are really the important components for them to count as a Harry Potter Fan Fiction.

**** Yeah I feel like you need at least one of the core element like characters, setting or magic system: culture for it to be a fan fic

***** At least one, perhaps two for preference though?

****** For me yes, but I would say if you're really passionate about an idea just write it!
