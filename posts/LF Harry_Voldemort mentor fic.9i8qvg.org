Harry is visited by Voldemort through the horcrux where Voldemort would soon take to teaching Harry magic. They can visit each other mindscape where they talk about their days and Harry learns magic.

One of the chapter is about Harry dreaming of his parents (and possibly Sirius if he is already dead in that fanfic). Harry had to transfigure chairs out of potted plants and hide Voldemort's green chair out of side. Harry started talking about his ongoings and soon reveal he is in contact with Voldemort with James (and Sirius) not really happy and Lily being sort of alright with it. (This story could possibly be slash but I can't remember if it was or it is only about Mentor! Voldemort. I vaguely remember details.)

Thank you for lending your help!
