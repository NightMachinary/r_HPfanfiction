No major anti-muggle attacks from the magical side, and surprisingly apart from a handful religious extremists in Saudi Arabia and Alabama not too much anti wizard hate. Success, right?

But then muggles start buying potions to cure their various ailments. Turns out there's a lot of muggles demanding a lot of potions requiring a lot of ingredients, and the griffin breeders can't supply that many claws. Because griffins take quite some time to reach maturity, increasing the population can't be done that quickly. The same thing goes for pretty much every potion that requires parts of magical creatures: Demand goes way up, but the supply stays limited.

The obvious result: Prices skyrocket. Both muggle and magical governments try to limit the market to prevent catastrophe, but the trade simply moves to the black markets. Turns out the muggle economy is way larger than the magical one, and there's a lot of rich muggles who can spend millions on a single vial of potion. Brewers and ingredient suppliers rake in the cash, but the average witch or wizard just can't afford anything anymore.

St. Mungo's and other hospitals run out of potions and money. Wizard governments ask Gringotts to coin more to save their patients, but the result is Weimar-level inflation and devaluation of the galleon, leading to what Grindelwald and Voldemort failed to accomplish: Turning the entire wizarding world - or at least those who aren't making millions - against the muggles.


** I think, as always, the issue is that muggle currency is largely useless to wizards unless this is a completely AU world with a different economy and magic system. Not even gold seems very useful in canon as galleons only seem valuable due to the magic in them. They're fat and heavy and yet a thousand of them can be carried in a pocket. It seems that it's the goblin magic that provides weight, which explains why the serial number refers to goblin who casted the coin. It seems that gold would have to be turned into galleons by goblins, where ministry oversight can easily control the process.

However, I think the underlying principle does have merit. I definitely see an inundation of demand throughout the muggle world for wizarding products. However, instead of an economic collapse, I think that this would lead to tensions over the division between muggle and wizard. Muggles want wizarding products and feel frustrated by the lack of supply and the lack of wizards willing to sell. Wizards feel frustrated by the demand and outcry, and tensions become inflamed. Disputes over muggle-repelling charms would pop up, with wizards wanting to be able to keep muggles away (and their protests) and muggles would be displeased by the mere existence of said charms. Ultimately, wizards probably would turn against the muggles. But not because of economical reasons, because of the tension between the two worlds.

I very much agree with this line. However, I always assumed that wizards would be shrewd enough to covertly reach out to the worlds' richest 1%, offer a few things at insane prices and then let this interaction remain the precedent as the Statute of Secrecy falls.

Now this titanic boom in menial production-type jobs for wizards and witches is at least working top-down instead of bottom-up and your lowest employees can all buy mansions and sports cars.

Half-bloods and muggleborn in their thirties would see this as a godsend, given their previous employment opportunities in the magical world.

The pureblood faction would throw a giant shit-fit and would probably be entitled to said fit. This economic and cultural shift would be hard for them to adjust to and a large part of the wizarding worlds upper class would likely fade in with the rest of the new rising wizard dynasties

** Ehh. Potions would certainly get super expensive... But so would any other magical industry. Remeber, there's only so many magical to go around, so I'd think they would ALL get rich pretty quick. Except of course those who don't bother working or learning who either have chosen to live by their own means, or don't amount to much of a magical anyway.

** Easy: Use time turners to create a sort of time bubble and make animals reach maturity in a few seconds. Use fertility and lust potions to increase the breeding rate too. And potion ingredients are scarce? Well, now you have an entire planet to grow them on, rather than a pesky acre or two in the ass end of nowhere. Fully maintained by House-elves too, so wizards don't toil away like slaves.

This is what always bugs me about Potterverse magic and the Statute of Secrecy. This magic system and world is so incredibly unbalanced and OP that not only a single, slightly above average, wizard could take over the Muggle world in a single day. But also, Magic can easily tackle pretty much every problem imaginable. How wizards aren't the unchallenged masters of the world will forever be beyond me.

We have no clue how house-elves (a magical, non human species, I might add) came to be, or if they're not an artificial species to begin with. There are quite a few folk/mythological creatures who pop into existence solely to serve humans/other deities. Not to mention the entire debate about androids in sci-fi. For all we know, they are just handy robots made by some wizard/witch in their spare time.

Numbers. Wizards don't reproduce even closely as much as Muggles do - depending on whom you ask (math vs JKR) there's only something to 280-1000 students at Hogwarts at any given time which means there are only something like 100-200 Wizard children born a year in the UK at the top range - Muggle UK however breeds over 700k children a year.

A war is catastrophic for the Wizard population - alone the final Batte of Hogwarts took at least 60 lives, and god knows how many people were killed by the Death Eaters.

And the rest of the world isn't in a much better place - there are only 11 known schools for Wizards worldwide, with populous countries such as Germany, India and China not having one at all...

That is why Wizards went into hiding in the first place (and is a common trope among other wizard/magic fictions such as Artemis Fowl).

Why, because 'slavery'? This pretty much circles back to what I said in another reply: we have no clue what house-elves are, how they came to be, or how they even function. Don't get tangled up in the emotionally charged threads on this subreddit that equate it with real life Colonial slavery, because it's not the same thing. This is more similar to robot subservience, at least from the scarce canon data we have so far. Sure, debates can be held about where does the line between simulating emotions and actually feeling them is, or what constitutes a sentient being, or artificial life vs. traditionally biological life, etc etc. But from the vague canon we have, and from parallels with folk tales and mythology, I personally would not equate beings such as house-elves with other beings such as Goblins, or Centaurs, and I would absolutely not equate them to real life slaves. Our real life world is heading fast towards automation, and humanoid robot servants are quite openly on the agenda. While house-elf liberation movements would probably exist, as this subreddit quite clearly proves, I think you severely under-estimate just how much of the Muggle population would want to get their hands on a house-elf just for daily household chores.

I have no idea how Magic works in Artemis Fowl, but in Harry Potter, numerical (dis)advantage makes no difference at all. One Apparition and an Imperius later, and you have the POTUS under complete control. Through him, you have pretty much half the world. If we're talking HP timeline, get the Soviet Chairman under a quick Imperius, and you got the other half of the world under heel too. Or even better, go to a sperm bank and replace everything with samples from wizards. Muggles will be bred out of existence without even breaking the Statute.

Time turners have the grave potential for misuse, there's a reason they are next to unused (even when it comes to grave events such as Voldemort's death), and I can easily imagine that like with items as the Elder Wand, the Invisibility Cloak, the Resurrection Stone or the Philosopher's Stone the knowledge of /how to make them/ got lost in history or never been documented at all. At least as far as lore goes, there has been one attempt at doing so (by the Malfoys), which nearly led to catastrophe so I highly doubt that anyone would even think about releasing the technology to the general public.

#+begin_quote

We at least know that they are living beings capable of emotion and intelligence. Hell we even think it's cruel to keep /dolphins/ in cages even though they cannot speak with us. Ethically, it is seen as questionable enough to mass farm pigs and cattle.

Agreed, but we're discussing a scenario where Wizards are known to Muggles - therefore they would /very/ likely at least be suspicious if the President started to behave weirdly (okay, maybe not with Trump because that guy is a fucking loon, but you get the general idea). They would rebel.

You'd need to train all the new Wizards that would result out of this, plus sperm banks are not /that/ commonly used - in the whole US, 60k a year contrasted to ~3.2 M births overall. Assuming a plan for world domination of Wizards... that can't work out no matter how.

Not every world event in human history needs a parallel in Harry Potter. This is a non-human species in a world were the laws of physics and traditional logic don't always have to apply.

If we, in real life, will have humanoid, android servants in a couple of centuries, I'm willing to bet HP wizards came up with some kind of ritual to accomplish this before Muggles. We already know they can create biological bodies, and animate things that shouldn't normally be animated.

That's the biggest problem. Potions and pre-enchanted objects are the only bits of magic Muggles can use, so obviously demand for them would skyrocket.

Regarding potions, the only way this would work demand/supply wise is to drastically increase the population of plants and animals used in potions decades in advance, and that would require lots of manpower. Maybe if a select group of Muggles (family of Muggle-borns and half-bloods, for instance) and Squibs helped out, raising animals and growing plants in out-of-the-way places (deserts and rainforests, for instance), it could work, but it would be a massive undertaking.

** Do correct me if I'm wrong, but how exactly will this cause inflation? The fall of SOS won't lead to integration of the magical and non-magical economies; there'll be intersections, no doubt, especially with muggle-borns; nonetheless, I'd wager that most mages would still take galleons. After all, habit and xenophobia aside, the magical currency would be MUCH more stable (what with lower economic output, economic growth, currency backed by gold, i.e. slower increase of the money supply, coupled with what seems to be an utter lack of fractional reserve banking). Further, the mages' demand for non-magical goods and services won't be anywhere near high enough to offset that, not for the short term. One of the reasons is the aforementioned xenophobia; but cultural differences not quite taken to that extreme are a thing too. For all we know, wizards are just /confused/ at muggle fashion in the same way a guy from, i dunno, poland, will be confused at the appeal of cricket or golf.

No, what you'll have, is simply that the non-magical currencies will be even less valuable compared to the magical ones (basically PPP) since magical goods and services are imminently more valuable than non-magical ones (and not the least of which is due to supply/demand -- the medical stuff alone would be mind-boggingly valuable). If anything, it'll -- at least for the medium term -- create deflation for the muggle economies: more of their money is flowing into a foreign (i.e the magical) nation, with (presumably) less of it coming back. And as demand for wizarding goods and services grow higher and higher, so too will the value of the galleon compared to, say, a dollar; so mages wouldn't want to trade in non-magical currencies at all, so even muggle billionaires won't have as big of an advantage as you think; money is valuable first and foremost as a medium of exchange, and dollars just aren't as valuable to mages who hold an unbreakable monopoly on their goods and services.

And matter of fact is, there's a lot of markets and industries that do just fine without magic, or won't be affected as much given the VERY limited supply of mages. As there are very few mages, then even if there is strong demand for their services in, say, the food industry, the gains of hiring a mage must not outweigh the cost (MR>=MC); we don't know the possibilities of magic, but in any event, i'm sure that even if integrating magic /immediately/ is worth it, it will still take some time to happen. And flooding the market with cheaper stuff actually lowers the costs in the market; should that happen across enough industries, then it can even be called deflation.

And then there are further complications, such as whether or not certain industries will survive literal magical competition; but given the low population of mages, then it's actually possible that most of them may even survive. And, of course, there's also a STRONG possibility that someone (both mages and muggles) knows basic (and advanced) economic theory and will therefore be well-informed free agents.

No, the economic implications of such an event are too complex to consider; but my point is, I /highly/ doubt the events you describe will cause inflation for mages -- or even muggles at that; certainly nothing that would start an economic crisis on either side. No, as someone else already said on this thread, there will definitely be social tensions; those, i feel, will be the ones to muck things up way, way more than economical ones.

TLDR; what inflation? what economic crisis?
