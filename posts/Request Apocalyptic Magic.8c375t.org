There aren't a lot of stories in which the stakes are truly existential, beyond the fate of Britain. The only one that comes to mind off the top of my head is Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time. Anyone have any others with huge stakes to recommend? Only well written ones, please.


** Revenge of the Wizard by Darth Marrs His stories are usually too dark for me, but this is definitely an end-of-world/apocalypse Harry Potter fic (and crossover with the Star Wars universe). Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10912355/1/Revenge-of-the-Wizard]])

It's a shame you have to waddle through so many irritating mistakes and a lack of commas to get there. Still, I'd highly recommend if you can get through the first section.

Taking the request literally, there's the "Battle" of Kashyyk in linkffn(I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For), where Harry unleashes his full power for the first time, and changes reality on a fundamental level.
