I've asked in a few other places, but no one seems to remember this one.

From what I remember, Harry has a summer fling and at the end of the summer they separate and he gives her Hermione's parents information if she needs to contact him. I guess 9 months later she reaches out and he arrives at the hospital right after she gave birth. The baby is a girl and she wanted Harry to meet her before she put her up for adoption. Harry begged to take the baby and she finally agrees when she sees that he goes to a well off school. So now Harry is raising a baby while doing his final year at Hogwarts and Snape ends up helping him. I remember Snape gives her a bangle around her ankle which has a tracker charm on it when they go and meet the mother again before she goes back to America.

Does anyone remember this one and where it is?

Summary: /Harry discovers that his muggle girlfriend from the previous summer wants to put their child up for adoption. Instead, Harry brings the baby back to Hogwarts, and finds Snape to be unexpectedly helpful./

** I cannot believe some petty person downvoted the post and all of our comments. You asked for a fic, I found the fic, you thanked me --- and they downvoted every step of the way.
