**** While I agree it totally gets out of hand, I much prefer AO3. I find it's a lot more user friendly for me for searching and bookmarking pieces, and I also find it easier to read. I remember ff.net from like... God, 15+ years ago? I felt like it was much easier to use back then. (My age is showing...) If a piece is only available on ff.net, I'll usually just not read it because I find the site so frustrating to use.

***** Haha, I was also on ff.net around then. Stuck with it until the last few years, I just haven't been reading as much fanfiction. AO3 has great content so it's frustrating for me to be so pushed away by the tags. And I haven't figured out how to exclude things? Like, on ff.net you could search and exclude certain pairings. In AO3 if I select Hermione/Harry, I'll get literally any story that has a million tags where that one happens to fall in somewhere. Maybe I'm just not trying hard enough haha.

****** Hahaha, I'm the complete opposite! I don't know how to search for things on ff.net if my life depended on it. I actually didn't really get back into reading fanfiction until a few years ago when I got back into gaming... certain hobbies seem to come hand-in-hand for me, I guess.

As for the exclusion of pairings, under the filters tag on the right-hand side, scroll down until you see the header "Search within results". In that bar, place a minus sign (" - ") and whatever pairing/theme/tag you don't want. So for example**, if you are looking under the tag "Harry Potter/Hermione Granger" and don't want to see any pieces that include Snape/Hermione, you would put "-Severus Snape/Hermione Granger" in that line and pieces that contained those tags would be removed from the search results.

Does that make sense?

On the flip-side, how the heck do you even search for specific pairings on ff.net?

** Actually not a fan of HP/HG, but it seemed like an easy crowd-pleasing example.

******* Searching for specific pairings on ff.net is easy.

They've revamped their system, so it lets you select up to four characters.

So you select two characters and then they have a little box you can check for "Pairing."

Personally, I far prefer the system on ff.net

******** Problem with that though is that it obviously only applies to any story posted/updated after the revamp, and even then only if the author actually does it.

Add to that the crappy search and complete absence of tags and you have the reason I've basically stopped using ff.net years ago. It might have more stories overall, better stories overall and most importantly more stories in ships/tags/concepts/etc I'm interested in, but that's useless when I can't even look for them.

** This is one of my pet peeves when it comes to Fan Fiction. Its IMPOSSIBLE to find fan fiction anymore by tags because people just tag the shit out of their stories, even going so far as lying about whats actually in it. I go to search for something and get more fics that are not actually representing what I want, then the ones that actually fit the search.

And because the more tags the more likely your story shows up on a search, there is no reason for an author to not over-tag. They should really limit the amount of tags one can use, and force authors to write good descriptions and then have the search system use the tags OR descriptions based upon how you search.

*** Yeah this is the worst. Especially for secondary characters. There's no possible way to tell whether the fic is really about that character, or it just shows up for a one-liner.

For the less popular character it's really frustrating when there's 10K search results but realistically only like 20 of those are actually what you're looking for.

Tags should be limited to 15.

There's a few...kind-of-okay romance stories on AO3, but the only ones I'm familiar with are part of fandoms that are much, much smaller than Harry Potter.

Basically, there's this one sit-com that has fanfic that I...occasionally skim, though I rarely follow a fic closely.

But yeah, the smut on AO3 can make even Deviantart look respectable.
