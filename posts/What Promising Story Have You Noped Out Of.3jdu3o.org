So, I just read the latest chapter for Heirs of the Founders. It's a story that includes the Goblin training and Lord Harry tropes, but I was interested in where the author was going to go with those.\\
The only thing that made me uneasy was, of course, sex. There's a poly relationship between adults, including the Grangers, and it was basically stated that Hermione was also going to be poly. However, the story also emphasized that this was not the norm, muggle or wizard. The relationship aspect always skirted the line for me in terms of appropriateness, but this last chapter seemed to hop over it when it came to things between two of the younger characters. It's a shame, really, because the writing is good, and I was interested in where the author was going in other parts. So here's my question for you: what are some stories you've read that seemed promising, and then something happened that made you nope outta there?


** I'm sure there are more promising stories that I've noped out of, but I was reading a rather interesting Harry/McGonagall fic that I noped out of after the author consistently spelled Weasley and Slytherin as Weasely and Slytherine. Oh and they thought Crookshanks name was Crankshaft.

Also, any time Snape shows up at the Dursley's I nope out.

** Just because you write in your A/N that you do not condone paedophilia in any way does *not* make it ok to have characters in your story enjoy same.

Black Princess is very close to this, with the only saving grace being that there is never a scene actually describing Narcissa fucking the protagonist in detail.

But there are others...

So, to make it abundantly clear: Its not okay to write positive about a scene like Sirius Black having outrageuous sex with a 13 year old Hermione. Much less is it ok when Hermione is then "dick-drunk" for the next 7 years until she finally completely succumbs to the authors stupidity and marries Sirius to have more of his prick in her...

and now I stop before I write myself in a rage.

*** Haven't you heard? Slytherin house organize orgies every saturday... And Draco is the Prince of them.

More seriously I have no problem with teenagers having sex (meaning 15 and above)... but there are two things that I find disgusting: -sexualized children of course. A 11yo should barely go beyond "that person's cute", at 12-13 not beyond crushed or a few (very) awkward kisses with characters the same age. -The other thing that I find repulsive is when a teacher is involved. I don't care about the age or the maturity of the character, I don't even care if they are 18. As someone who will soon teach IRL, those relationship makes me sick. Having fantasises about your math teacher is okay, an actual relationship is really really creepy.

Also as people talked about it, I'm not that bothered by Tonks/Harry... ONLY if Harry is mature enough. And by mature I don't mean in the "I'm gonna kick Dumbledore and the Weasleys in the butt and make my own Order. With Blackjacks and hookers!" way; but interesting enough for a late-teen person (it's easier if Harry has a crush at 15 and something happends when he is 16-17). Any other thing is weird.

It's a wrong BWL, has some clich√©s but does them in interesting way. The Slytherin Prince aspect must be earned and can only be bestowed on to a worthy candidate if they pass the test.

*** Kids having sex in general bothers me! To be honest, when I was that age, 13 year olds having sex seemed quick for their age, but sort of normal to me. 11 year olds seeing a girl and saying "she's hot" as well. Maybe I'm getting old but I feel really uncomfortable reading about 11 year olds in a sexual context. I feel like 13 year old girls maybe have crushes, like Hermione with Lockhart, but getting attracted to each other and having "mature" relationships before 15 weirds me out.

***** It's very awful. Like, one year older, maybe two years. When you're 15 and you're "dating" a 19 yo, I'm very skeptical about the 19 yo. Let alone when there's a 20 year gap. Reminds me of child brides.

Sad thing in stories that are Tonks-centric, is that she never seems to use her Metamorphagic abilities a lot. Some times the most "creative" she gets is enlarging her boobs and changing her hair colour. While I certainly think that Tonks should date a guy that likes her for how she looks, she's young and single. I'd expect her to go muggle clubbing as a guy, looking completely different, etc. Never happens.

On the subject of Tonks' kinks: I can't, for the life of me, remember this one fic where Tonks lives out some seriously creepy fetishes and fantasies with her ability. It was a fun read, tbh. One scene had her seducing Kingsley as a hot, french surfergirl. Another had her get into Narcissa Malfoys pants by acting as her poolboy. Or the one where she's hired as a Dominatrix for Amelia Bones fantasies. Stuff like that. Harry played the role as confidante and the entire thing is written in dialouge between Tonks and Harry. I recommend beer and/or weed while reading (should you find it).

***** Seeing as this is the wizarding population of Britain, and they're stuck at a boarding school without parental supervision, I'd definitely expect the majority to have some experience (varying from first to last base) when they leave Hogwarts. Not at 15 though. I think the "average virginity loss age" is 17?

EDIT: quickly looked up statistics, seems that the average age in the UK is 16. Might be higher because of some insecure boys and girls that want to have been "fast", but that's just speculation.

*** Well, it depends how you handle it. Writing about pedophilia certainly isn't wrong - sure, pedophilia IS wrong, but so is rape, torture and murder.

The problem with pedophilia in fanfiction is writers that have no clue how to utilise it properly and writes it likes it completely okay and a normal occurrence. There's never any side-effects or consequences or any exploration of the theme - that's whats wrong with it.

If you have a pedophile character and hell, even a groomed minor, that's completely /fucking/ fine *if* you recognise what's going on and write it properly. /Don't/ bloody handwave it away, if you are going to write something this controversial you have to do it properly.

If it moves from one event to the next it shouldn't be called a filler.

A filler is an event in itself which does not change anything.

No one learns anything

No realtionship changes

No knowledge is gained

No one of power was defeated

No one important was lost.

You could tell the whole story and not mention that part and no one would miss it. Stories with an intreseting start but but no developement.

** Every slash story i've ever read has resulted in one of three things:

1) Everyone is gay and it's just unrealistic.

2) Super graphic sex written by, i'm assuming, people who have never had sex.

3) Ridiculously unrealistic relationships that only occur because both characters are gay.

Also as a result of this all anyone talks about is that they're gay.

The only exception is the Saving Connor series which I can't get into despite repeated attempts because it's filled with incredibly disturbing child abuse.

I really didn't like that at all. Angst can be fun to read and when done well it will make me very anxious and excited about the outcome of the story. But sometimes it's just way overdone and it's more annoying and frustrating than anything.
