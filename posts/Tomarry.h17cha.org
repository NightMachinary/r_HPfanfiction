:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I know that Harry ended up in the past somehow and they got together, but what really stands out in my memory is that they bought an apartment building? and were warding it themselves and were renting out the lower apartments while they were going to live in the top.

Not much to go on, i know, but if you can find it that would be amazing!!

**** Oh no worries. It can be kind of slash unfriendly in this comm and also there's just a better chance someone's read a slash fic you're trying to find over at [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]].
