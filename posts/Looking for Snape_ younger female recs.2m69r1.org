Hi everyone! I'm looking for Snape/younger female relationship fic. My otp was always Snape/Hermione, and I feel like I've read most of those (but will be more than happy to find out I'm wrong), but lately I've read 'The Never-ending Road' which is Snape/female harry and it was simply amazing.

So what I'm looking for is: * A well written Snape * No time travel please! * I like higher ratings usually * It doesn't have to be relationship centered * preferably rather long fics

Do any of you know anything like that? That'd be amazing. Thank you!

Edited: fotmating. I'm trying (in vain) to make it more readable.

*** I've read her long story (A New Beginning), but not the one-shots. I can try and make a list of every SS/HG I've read but it will be very long, I've barely read any Snape fic that is not SS/HG. My favorites are "care of magical creatures" and "for the potion master's amusement". I alsolove anything marriage-law, assuming there's snape and a younger female XD is that helpful?
