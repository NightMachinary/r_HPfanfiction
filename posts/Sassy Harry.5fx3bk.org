One of my favourite bits of the HP books and movies was how sarcastic and witty some characters were. Lines like 'There's no need to call me sir, Professor.'

Unfortunately, most fanfiction authors either forget about that, or screw it up with unfunny lines, or have everybody roll on the floor with laughter at every line.

This post is for people to share their favourite sarcastic insults or jokes you've found in fics. Don't forget to include the fic it's from. As an example, from lunakatrina's 'So Sue Me.'

But if you were planning a surprise party," Harry asked, "would everyone think you were throwing a party for Voldemort? Like: what are you getting you-know-who for the you-know-what'?"

Dumbledore tugged on his beard, and replied thoughtfully, "Well..."

"Or what if you were talking to someone about their crush," Harry asked, "would everyone think you wanted to go with Voldemort? Like: 'You know who will definitely like that dress on you.'"


** Ding! That's my bullshit detector.

  “Scared Potter?” Malfoy sneered, and Harry snapped. He was done, finished, fed up with playing the innocent little Gryffindor with no common sense and a microscopic amount of intelligence. He rolled his eyes.“Why yes Malfoy, I'm terrified, can't you see me quaking in my boots? You, a second year child armed with a stick is the scariest thing I've ever seen. Please, please don't fatally injure me in front of three hundred witnesses and two teachers with your mean words and nasty smiles. Whatever shall I do?” The entire hall fell silent and Malfoy gaped. Harry smirked. Lockhart looked entirely bemused, and he thought Snape might be holding back a laugh.Harry spent his first year hiding his intelligence and playing the role of the Boy Who Lived. However Lockhart and Malfoys' combined presence finally causes him to snap, and chaos ensues from there.

** Well, /Oh God, Not Again!/ has quite a bit of snark. Harry travels back in time (this time it's an accident) and has to live his all over again. He decides to have some...fun with it.

*Finally, Remus was satisfied they had the spell down. "Right, Neville. First things first: What would you say is the thing that frightens you most in the world?"

"The thought of Harry as Minister of Magic," Neville responded immediately.

"Hey!" Harry protested while the rest of the class laughed.

"Harry as Minster of Magic...hmmm...Neville, I believe you live with your grandmother?"

"Sure do," Neville said cheerfully. "But she'd be just as scary as Minister, though obviously for different reasons."

"No, no you misunderstand me," Remus explained. "I wonder, could you tell me what your grandmother wears?"

Harry was starting to get a *bad* feeling about this.

** Harry made a show of checking his pockets then nodded. “You're right. Apparently my give-a-shite has gone missing. Let me know if you locate it.”

** Important safety tip #1: Always test new spells on something you don't mind losing. I foolishly chose my trunk, and used plenty of power to make sure it would shrink small.

Important safety tip #2: Never drink around your books. Drops of tea can make Reducio look like Reducto with very little effort.

My trunk is now a pile of splinters. At least the contents were unaffected. I could just cry.

Reducio. RED-OOO-SEE-OWE. Countered by Engorgio, the chaser's favorite charm.

Reducto. REE-DUCK-TOW. Countered by a shield charm or a trip to Hogsmeade I can't make or afford.

**** I think it's from Holly Evans and the Spiral Path, which would make sense because this was posted by its author ;)

***** It is linkffn(Holly Evans and the Spiral Path). Have some more.

Holly: "Oh. Is that why you've been flirting with me?"

Tonks: "Eh? Why wouldn't I? You're dead sexy!"

Holly: "Yah, but I've been led to understand that lesbianism isn't well-regarded."

Tonks: "Oh, that. I don't much truck in philosophies, but for one thing I'm not a non-breeder so it's alright, right? Not that I've had sprogs yet, but I'm not opposed in the least. For another, I'm a metamorph. It's in our nature to be polysexual, just like Veela and their daughters are bisexual. You might as well ask a dog not to lick! Hang on, that didn't come out right."
