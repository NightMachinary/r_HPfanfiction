I'm hoping someone has something that is drag-and-drop easy. I have read hundreds, probably thousands of fanfics, but when it comes time to rec them, I hardly ever remember enough about titles or authors to find them again.

I could cobble something together, just start a document or use an email to store online since I'm constantly failing to backup, something like that, but I wonder if there is already some free online service in place out there that makes it super easy.


** I just have a bookmark folder organized. It has a folder for ones I have read, and then inside they are organized by genre and ships if there is one. There is also a folder for ones that I have not read yet but want to/ones people have rec'ed.

** If you're a fan of (literally) saving them for future reads, I recommend [[http://www.flagfic.com][flagfic]]. It's been linked here before, so apologies if you've seen it already.

It does take a little dedication though, especially if you're on an archiving spree.

** If you read them on fanfiction.net, you could just add them to a favorites list :)

*** That's what I do. (: And, the most recently updated one goes to the top of the list on your profile. So, it takes like five seconds to check if your stories have been updated or not.

*** People doing so should keep in mind that fanfiction.net has a policy about adult content and semi-random enforcement of it. If favourites have mature fics, they can potentially become dead links if enough haters complain. Had to start archiving on my own because of this.

** As mentioned, fanfiction.net has a set up to keep track of both favorites, and fics you want updates for. As well as author alerts...

Other websites aren't as helpful. I'm dealing with either bookmarking them, which is fairly easy and able to be synced with browsers like google chrome, or saving the urls in an excel, .doc, or .txt file.

** If you use ffnet then just put them on your alerts list, then it emails you when updated.
