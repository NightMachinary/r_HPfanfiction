I have two requests.

1. Good Voldemort (such as [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1644645/19/Harry-s-Savior]])

2. Good Dursleys. I've only read one story where the Dursleys were totally good. ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6992471/1/Lily-s-Changes]])

#+begin_quote
  Being the recipient of the Order of Merlin and also having his picture on the Chocolate Frog Cards was not a big feat for Healer Tom Riddle. As Head Healer at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, nothing much surprised him. Little did he know, his life was about to be turned upside down by the arrival of a bespectacled boy with messy hair through the Veil.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  The only time Tom had ever failed at anything; he didn't care that he had mucked it up. Although; thinking back on it, mucking it up was the only chance either of them had for success.
