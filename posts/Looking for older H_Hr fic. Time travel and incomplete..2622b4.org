I'm looking for an older (pre-2007) fic. It was a time travel fic where Harry came back from a future where they lost. Luna was his mad scientist sidekick in the future timeline. Harry uses Fred and George to infuse magic into Muggle guns and other weaponry. Lucius Malfoy ends up kidnapping Hermione. It was never complete as far as I remember.

**** It is. The author's last update was around three years ago, but he hasn't specifically abandoned anything, so there is hope.

***** I've always enjoyed Ruskbyte's writing. It's a shame he hasn't finished a lot of his fics.
