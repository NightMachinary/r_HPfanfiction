** IIIRC, there is one where HP is basically a squib, and does exactly that.

***** I'm reading it now. Not sure if I'd reread it, but it's respectably OK.

Edit: finished. It finishes with 4th year. I'd probably read the sequel if the author wrote one, and I might read the author's other work.

  What if Vernon and Petunia were even more successfull in 'beating all that nonsense' out of Harry? A silly AU story of a nonpowerful, but cunning, Harry.

  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.

** For the first I wholeheartedly second "Almost a Squib".

For the second I recommend [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/601542?view_full_work=true][Dudley's Memories]]. It's one of the better "Dudely Redemption" fics since it gives Dudley a valid reason to be so accepting of Harry (and recasts a lot of his behaviour during canon). It's also canon-compliant (but not epilogue compliant).

It's also part of a longer series (also good) that explores Snape's character too, but I like the first fic in the series the best.

** Those Dudley ones are way too obsessed with canon and the epilogue for my tastes. Some of those scenarios are sorta interesting, but they all include one of my least favourite Fanfiction tropes: Lets turn asshole chracters from canon into lovable good guys. 2edgy4me.

How about this?

#+begin_quote
  Dudley, just as is statistically expected, becomes just as terrible as his father. When his daughter shows signs of magic he asks dear old dad for help and they try to beat the magic out of her. One year later Secret Agent Potter who works for a newly created magical task force in the muggle government is asked to investigate a magical disturbance in Little Whinging.

*** I think that expecting someone to be a terrible parent because they had terrible parents is a little heart-breaking, really. Maybe it's just the way you worded it, but saying Dudley won't turn out any better makes me think of all those people who had abusive parents who attempt to do better for their own kids. And given that Dudley does show some remorse after the Dementor attack and later in the books attempts to treat Harry a little better, it doesn't seem entirely unlikely that he would be a better father than his father.

It is, but that's not my fault, it's reality. I wish the world were fluffy and nice where everyone had the same chance of becoming a good person no matter their upbringing.

Yeah sure, I probably came across as too harsh. It's totally possible that he realizes the errors of his ways. But considering his upbringing and ... disposition... towards violence I wouldn't place any bets.
