** *We are the Golden Trio!*, linkffn(7405516): the Trio and a 5 Day old Rose got thrown back to 1991. Fun story, but writing quality is mediocre (too many grammar errors and typos).

** linkffn(The Hogwarts Strike Team)

Really good premise and H/Hr friendship-relationship. The reason for time-travel feels justified. And they actually /do/ something with their foreknowledge instead of sitting around and waiting for Voldemort's war to begin. However, it's possibly abandoned due to the author being unhappy with the latest couple of chapters.

  An older and more experienced Harry and Hermione return to their first year at Hogwarts. Their goals? Assassinate Death Eaters, destroy Horcruxes, and deal with Voldemort's hidden contingency plan... by any means necessary. And maybe they'll fix a few other things along the way.
