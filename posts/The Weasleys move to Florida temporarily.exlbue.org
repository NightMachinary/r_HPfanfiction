To stay with great aunt Tessie , in Florida . While Molly and Arthur Collected what was left of the nuisance Voldemort, And Saut√©d His massacred Soul fragments.

In Molly's cast iron skillet, With some nice basilisk venom sauce. It gave the Horcruxes A nice fruity aftertaste. They said the remnants to the gnomes in the back garden. Giving the poor fellows the worst diarrhea imaginable
