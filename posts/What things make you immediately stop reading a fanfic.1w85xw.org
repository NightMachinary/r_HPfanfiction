** - bad grammar or spelling
- repeated mentions of a character's (often very good) looks/appearance
- out of character immediately followed by bashing (ie Ron being prejudiced against non-Purebloods promptly followed by bashing)
- characters involved in relationships wholly inappropriate for their age (11 year old Harry and Hermione can have love at first sight I GUESS but react realistically! Shyness, awkwardness, outright fear -- not make out sessions)
- teacher-student romantic relationships

This is the big one for me. Whenever someone recommends a fic and I see that it's HG/SS or HP/SS it's an instant NOPE. Applies to any cross-generational pairing, not just teacher/student.

** Kids. Children. Babies. Leave that stuff for the epilogue!

Okay, I lied. I won't immediately stop reading, but it's quite annoying to me when Harry, as a teenager, has a dream of having kids with Ginny / Hermione / whoever his girlfriend is. It's completely unrealistic. What 15-year-old /wants/ to have children?

Or when some little child (often Muggle) is introduced just so Harry could befriend him / her and act all cute and other characters could comment on how he'd make a great father.

Or even worse, when Harry is forced (or rather, he wants to) adopt a child or even a baby who lost his parents to Death Eaters or whatever.

This is one of my pet peeves in fanfiction, so I don't expect everyone to agree with me.

********* After thinking about it, I agree. I don't believe it is due to the quality of the fanfic though, but rather because of the things the fanfic stands for and how popular it is. Let's be honest, there are a lot of popular fanfics with cliches that people don't hate on as much as they do MPMOR. In my personal opinion, I believe a lot of people hate it because of the subject matter and because people are generally annoyed when others love something they don't like.

I personally like MPMOR because it is so subtle and it has a character that doesn't go looking for trouble (in the beginning, at least) and still ends up having to deal with it.

** Saying "you're a parseltongue" or other close-but-no-cigar use of canon jargon.

More emphasis on relationships than plot. That's personal preference though.

First person POV is fine, but asking rhetorical questions to the reader is annoying.

Also, stream-of-consciousness probably isn't going to work very well in fanfic. If you can grammer and spell goodly then you are probably better than 90% of fanfic authors out there, but you ain't Jack Kerouac.

When authors don't have at least a rough idea of where the plot is going. Seat of your pants writing tends to end up making weird leaps in plot. Real example that made me quit reading after quite a few chapters: 'they're doing a cool magic ritual, and now they're trapped in a cave with their clothes disintegrating. Now they're crossing a lake that they just said was suicide and now they're fairies that look just like humans and still use wands.' All that over the length of a couple of chapters. It would have been great if he'd gone with the ritual idea, but instead decided to make them into fairies. I can't think of many reasons that they would need to be secret fairies for the story (and none at all that would make me want to continue the story) and the author more or less admitted that he didn't either. That really bugged me.

Regarding multiple viewpoints: most of my fic is a Harry limited 3rd-person perspective, but I have one brief scene that flips between Harry and Hermione as they observe the other getting beaten up by an inferus. I want to make it work, so what, in your opinion, makes it possible to switch between perspectives?

Regarding OOC behavior: I'd like to have the canon characters harden as they are exposed to harsher experiences. Is there any behavior that you feel would be /too/ out of character to accept, regardless of how one leads up to it? Ex: Harry dropping an F-bomb.

**** The biggest thing for me when I'm reading a split narrative is to make sure their voices are distinguishable. Readers are easily confused and if I can't tell by the literary voice who's saying what, I'll be totally lost. Just like two different people speak in two different ways, so should your characters.

(In fact, I keep trying to read "Allegiant," the last book in that series by Veronica Roth, and I personally find her split narrative so appalling that I can't get past the first thirty pages. Try reading "Will Grayson, Will Grayson" by John Green and David Levithan for an example of a beautifully written one.)

And as for OOC behavior, I wouldn't find Harry's swearing bad. Look at the values he shows in the books: loyalty, bravery, love for family, and quite a bit of a god complex. Nowhere is he shown to have any problems with swearing. I'd have a problem if he, say, abandoned Ron or chose a safe path over helping someone. As long as actions follow the values exemplified the books, it's fine.

These are both done in "real," original fiction books. Does that annoy you too, or is this something else, like just a symptom of quality issues? That is sort of suggested in the second.

** cheesy nicknames for Voldemort....the moment i see "moldyshorts" or any variant, I'm done.

Surprise smut. Most fanfic authors have a really really weird "i hope this is what it's like" kind of vibe when it comes to sex scenes and 75% of the time they happen out of nowhere. ("Potter! Detention with Filch" loljk Snape bones harry and draco kinda thing)

As a bi guy i can appreciate a bit of slah, but make it obvious that's where this story is going. I hate reading a story with obvious chemistry between a hetero couple but then BOOM loljk Harry is blowing Ron in the great hall

There was a fic i read recently where all magical muggleborn children were being abducted, brainwashed, then adopted by pure bloods. I stopped reading what was a very long story when i saw a line that was effectively "Oh how glorious it is to have such a kind and compassionate leader as You-Know-Who!" sadly it's not the first time i've seen this kind of work in a "dark future" kind of story.....really drives me nuts

Too many Americanisms. The obsession with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3388784/7/Harry-Potter-Sirius-Black-s-Godchild][perfectly even teeth]], or dollar bills on Privet Drive.

Too much religion. Casual use of "God" as an expletive, Harry or Hermione going to church, anyone praying for whatever to happen. Religion is not a big deal in Britain. A European talking about his religion would feel about as awkward as an American talking about his bowel movements.

*** I don't think the use of God as an expletive would be too out of place if it's coming from Muggleborns. Religion may not be a big thing here but, in my experience at least, we still use phrases "Oh my God" and stuff fairly commonly. That said, I did attend a Methodist school (but not /because/ it was Methodist; just because it was (supposed to be) a good school that happened to also be Methodist) so maybe that influenced me.

That said, it's clear in DH that seven years is long enough for Hermione to pick up on wizard slang enough that it became instinctive to her. But this is an issue that strikes me as a small thing that can emphasize the difference between purebloods/Muggleborns - Hermione saying "Oh God" in a place where Ron might say "Bloody Merlin".

"God" is used as an expletive 16 times in all the 7 books (a period of 7 years!), while "Merlin" is used 18 times. Interestingly enough, even purebloods such as Draco Malfoy and Molly Weasley use "God" as an expletive.
