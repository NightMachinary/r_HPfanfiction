  Harry Potter thought his life's work was done with Voldemort's death. But between arriving in a new dimension, with two clingy Phoenixes, and creating a school unlike anything seen before, he may just be able to save thousands of lives and have fun while he's at it. That is... if he can get over that fact that his counterpart is a girl. Neville BWL, Fem!Harry, Dumbledore!Bashing.

  Harry Potter finds himself nearly one thousand years in the past, with one goal. He must build a school, of Witchcraft and Wizardry, without the help of Dumbledore or his old friends Hermione or Ron. Harry must learn to become a leader like never before, he must build a school that rivals Hogwarts itself so no man like Voldemort can ever rise to power. Super!Harry Grey!Harry

** There was one that took place in 4th year where Harry refused to participate in the tournament and instead created his own school. Barty had to attend the tournament instead lest he lose his magic, and he disguised himself as Harry and then died in the first task. McGonagall became the headmistress of Harrys new school and they had Sirius, Lupin and the grangers as teachers too.

Cant remember the name now though

** linkffn(Proud Parents by RobSt) is the only one that comes to my mind. Despite what the summary says, the story is actually mostly about Harry and Hermione hooking up and starting their own school. It is a Robst story though, with all that implies.

  Despite how impossible it seemed, Harry was sure his dad had saved the three of them from the dementors. After Hermione's time turner took them both back three hours, he was desperate to discover if who he'd seen casting that patronus was truly his dad. Harry certainly wasn't disappointed when his mum turned up instead, and changed the entire course of his life. Harry/Hermione

  Sick of the Dursleys and resolved to missing his few friends if it means getting away from the people of the Wizarding World and their nosy whispers, Harry gets the idea to leave it all behind for a while, just a bit, just for a rest. Like a camping trip, except he'll take enough provisions for a year or so...maybe some plants, seeds and things for a little garden. Maybe some time away from the things that weigh him down will help the constant highs and lows he's been feeling for a while now. Just a little break. (Or, the one where Harry says TTFN and takes himself off on an indefinite vacation and upsets a few very careful plans.)
