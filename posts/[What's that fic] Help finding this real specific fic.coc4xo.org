:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
All I remember about it is that Petunia died really early on, and Vernon never got all tainted by her bigoted opinions about magic and shit, so Vernon ended up actually taking care of Harry and being a good uncle to him when he went to Hogwarts?

  Instead of letting Vernon in on her sister's little secret, Petunia worked diligently to keep magic as nothing more than a fairytale. However, when she dies unexpectedly, leaving her husband a widower shortly before that fateful Halloween night, Vernon doesn't know what he's getting himself into when he takes Harry into his home.
