It's one of the most popular fanfics, at least on ffn.net, and I want to know why that is. I'd appreciate your opinion of the fic, and a few things in it that are cool. Thanks.


** It was published in 2005 so a lot of stuff that seems cliched and stale now was fresh then. It was THE time travel fic before Backward with Purpose. The author's Naruto story, Team 8 has also not aged well.

**** It was the first Naruto fic I read so I have some nostalgia and affection for it. But after reading a bunch of other fics and coming back to find the same Konoha/Hiashi/Sasuke/Sakura bashing, I got tired.

***** I'd love recommendations then, because I still really enjoy Team 8 and the concept, but god knows if he's ever gonna bother working on them again after 2+ years. All he ever posts is his own story, so I don't hold out hope.

So if you've found better stories, please let me know!

*** "Backward with Purpose" has probably aged better, and has better characterisations overall, but "Nightmares of Futures Past" has more consistent emotion and is just better written. At least that's what I think. :)

***** That is a good point, though I'll say that the Harry/Ginny romance is probably more interesting in "Backward with Purpose," since they're both adults in the bodies of children, who have to pretend to be children in order NOT to creep the others out. That's a more interesting take than the "Nightmares" situation.

Then again, I'm not easy to creep out. I don't care about romances, especially not fictional ones... so when other people say "eeew, creepy," I'm just like "eh, whatever." Unless it glorifies abuse and tries to present that as a good thing, like in the Twilight books....

******* I found that part realistic. Or, well, as realistic as a fic with that premise could be. They were twelve and thirteen, which means puberty had started and hormones were getting out of whack. This combined with their adult minds plus the fact that they had been married in their previous lives just overrode their common sense for a while. I don't really find that creepy. It's not as though either of them was taking advantage of the other here.

The Weasleys' reactions was perfectly understandable, mind. They didn't know that Harry and Ginny were older time-travellers; all they knew was that this suspicious boy was corrupting their two youngest, and trying to seduce their twelve-year-old daughter. The freak-out was justified -- in fact, this story was a good example of how to turn the Weasleys into antagonists without bashing them or turning them into villains. I think Harry's over-the-top anger at them was uncalled for.

He went out of his way to hide from them that he, Ginny and Ron were time-travellers, and then he got angry because... they didn't know he, Ginny and Ron were time-travellers, and behaved like any concerned family would when their children inexplicably change.

** Nightmares of Futures Past is probably THE "an adult Harry sends his mind back in time to occupy his younger body and relive his school days" fic out there. It wasn't the first HP story with that premise, but it was definitely the story that popularised the set-up and made time-travel fics an entire genre for HP fanfics.

Being so early and influential, the fic introduced and/or popularised a LOT of the tropes and plot points that are now thought of as staples or even cliches -- and, to be fair, this fic does most of said tropes/cliches better than most.

The best part of "Nightmares" is definitely the writing, and the sheer emotion that the author manages to insert into it. This is a very EMOTIONAL story, and the emotions are often really powerful; you can really feel the grief, the joy, the despair and the relief that Harry goes through.

Now granted, Harry in the fic is Harry in name only... he's essentially the main character of some American action flick; all angsty and kickass and anti-authoritan, and really the best and coolest and most awesome person EVER. But at least it's the good kind of American action flick where the hero struggles and suffers and WORKS for his success. When he accomplishes something, he's generally gone through a lot of trial and emotional turmoil and the success feels EARNED.

The worst part of the fic (apart from the Irish terrorists, that was just a low blow) is definitely the characterisations. They're not as bad as a lot of fanfic characterisations... excluding Harry, sometimes the characters do feel spot-on. More often, though, they don't.

These aren't the characters you know and love from canon; they're a slightly skewed version of them that far too often seem to exist just to cater and react to Harry's American action hero schtick and show how much cooler he is. It's most noticable with Neville, who is NOTHING like in canon, but the others have their wildly OOC moments too.

Dumbledore is definitely fanon-Dumbledore; he's SUPPOSED to be a master manipulator but is so easily outmaneuvered by Harry that it's laughable. Snape is just a total monster with none of the complexities of canon. Luna is essentially just in the fic as Neville's girlfriend, and her entire life revolves around being in love with Neville, with the occasional odd-and-quirky moment. Voldemort is... i dunno, he's barely in the story.

That said, if you can stomach the characterisations, or at least accept that these characters aren't the ones from canon, the fic is worth checking out. It has not aged as well as other fanfics, but there's still more good than bad about it.

** It features a very sincere and authentic take on Harry, I think, both as a scarred adult and as a vulnerable young person. Also a remarkably well-fleshed out and likable group of support characters with their own thoughts and motivations, including the rare Molly Weasley as a POV character.

I dunno. I quite like it. I get the sense when reading it that the author wasn't just living out some cool or tragic fantasy, but was really in the characters minds, empathizing with them. It's nothing special but it has a very genuine quality to it. It's worth a read!

** For me, it's the quality of the writing.

The story's been around so long now that almost all the plot elements have been taken and reused elsewhere but in NoFP they're done better. Then there are things like the descriptions of how Ron and Hermione die in the original timeline (not a spoiler since we find that out on page one), which are incredibly moving.

I reread this one every so often and always enjoy it. I just wish he'd finish the bloody thing.

  The war is over. Too bad no one is left to celebrate. Harry makes a desperate plan to go back in time, even though it means returning Voldemort to life. Now an 11 year old Harry with 30 year old memories is starting Hogwarts. Can he get it right?

** I'll add $0.02 that the author has struck a reasonable balance, IMO, between Harry having foreknowledge vs being surprised, or making mistakes, or encountering the Butterfly of Doom.
