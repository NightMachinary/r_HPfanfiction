I know it's a touchy subject but are there any stories where Harry actually has to deal with emotional problems from the Dursleys? Preferably in the middle of the scale between Whipped!Starved!Molested!Mute!Harry and Harry who turns into Superman!Sexgod!Harry just to spite them.

  Words have more power than we think. Thoughts & dreams can be revealed to those closest to us, to those we want to know more of, & to our greatest enemies. A single act of kindness, a single word can change someone's entire world. Join Harry on another adventure through his time at Hogwarts where even the quietest whispers can make a difference. Harry/Multi. Mature for a reason.

A year like none other, Harry eventually goes into therapy. [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=5036]]

I thought I would have a whole list, I have read hundreds of them, but I guess most of them weren't good enough to remember.

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.
