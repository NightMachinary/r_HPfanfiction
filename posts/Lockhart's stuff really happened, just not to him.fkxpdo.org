I'm not missing this, right? The contents of his books supposedly happened to someone, it just wasn't Lockhart. He entirely stole stuff from other people and then embellished bits to make good copy? So if that is right, I have two fic requests here:

/First/, are there fics that deal with Lockhart's stuff being real? Think the fic where Harry demonstrates to Rita Skeeter with Remus as a subject that the Homorphus Charm is real (pretty sure it's Amalgum - Lockhart's Folly, but I'm not certain). Just any fic where the events captured in Lockhart's books actually happened and the outcomes of that are looked at. Could be that they happened to other people or could be that they actually did happen to Lockhart (a la Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider, IIRC), whatever works.

/Second/, I'd like to see fics that deal with the kinds of events written there. That sort of 'Small Town Legend' vibe; adventures you'd hear old guys telling stories about in the local pub. Or the actual stories from his books happening to him or the actual people they supposedly happened to. Either works. A very wide request, I know, but I'm open to basically anything that even mildly fits.

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.


** You're correct that it's canon that Lockhart stole credit for things other people really did, then obliviated them.

  "My dear boy," said Lockhart, straightening up and frowning at Harry. "Do use your common sense. My books wouldn't have sold half as well if people didn't think Id done all those things. No one wants to read about some ugly old Armenian warlock, even if he did save a village from werewolves. He'd look dreadful on the front cover. No dress sense at all. And the witch who banished the Bandon Banshee had a harelip. I mean, come on -"

For fic recommendations that explore this, I recommend linkffn(6635363). Lockhart raises Harry, and tells him about how he didn't really do anything in his books so Harry doesn't try to emulate him and go on dangerous adventures.

  When a chance meeting reveals Harry's planned fate to Lockhart, he knows what he has to do: rescue him and raise him as his own to properly manage his celebrity status. Harry gets a magical upbringing, Lockhart gets the Boy-Who-Lived...everybody wins!

** I can't help you fic wise, but you're correct in that Lockheart's claims actually happened. It just wasn't it to him. He actually addressed this in COS to Harry and Ron when they came to him for help. It turns out that he oblivated the people the events really happened to, and his one strength was a mean Oblivation charm.

** In the crossover fic by AlfeheimWanderer, "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11070121/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Heirs-of-Slytherin][Shinji Matou and the Heirs of Slytherin]]", Lockhart is as deadly as his books suggest and then some, having done everything he's written. He is competent and very, very lethal - in this fic universe he is actually /sandbagging/ to make it so that he is consistently underestimated.

This fic is the second in a series. Link to the first fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10918531/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Philosopher-s-Stone][here]]. Be warned, this is a crossover with Fate/stay Night, so some oddities are bound to come up, but overall it's a damn good read.

*** What's Fate/Stay Night? From the two names, I'm assuming an anime, but do I need a rundown/quick google for the basics before I read the fic?

**** Fate/stay Night was originally a Visual Novel published by Type Moon before getting a shitload of anime adaptations and spinoffs. It depicts the events of the Fifth Holy Grail War, an event where Magi, people capable of magic, summon ancient heroes to fight for the Grail. The VN was split into three routes: Fate, Unlimited Blade Works and Heaven's Feel.

The Grail is not actually the cup of Christ. It is a magical artifact allowing the winner the of Holy Grail War to be granted one wish. It is omnipotent.

The story follows a Japanese teenager and amateur magus, Emiya Shirou, who is caught up in the Holy Grail War without meaning to.

If you want to get a quick understanding of Fate, watch the Ufotable-animated Unlimited Blade Works and Heaven's Feel anime or perhaps the Ufotable-animated prequel, Fate/Zero, depicting the Fourth Holy Grail War.

Shinji Matou is a character in Fate. He is...not a good human being, at least by the time we meet him in Fate canon (17 years old...ish). He's got an overwhelming inferiority complex and desire to gain magical power because, spoiler alert, he's supposedly the heir to the Matou family magics, but due to his lack of a certain magical organ, can never perform Matou magic despite canonically being a polymath.

***** Ah, okay. I definitely don't have the time right now to watch a whole anime to read one fic, but I'll add it to the list to look into before I read that one. Thanks for the rec!
