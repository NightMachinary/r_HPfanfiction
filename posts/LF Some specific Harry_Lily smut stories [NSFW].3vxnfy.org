*** That's because we have a great community here. It is no one's place to judge the fiction that another may enjoy. We are here to simply help each other wherever we can. Personally, I think it is fantastic that people here are so accepting and willing to help.

**** That and the fact that the entire reason incest is a bad idea is because of genetic defects after several generations of continued inbreeding. Take away the kids and incest is... just sex.

***** The community tends to be accepting and accommodating but there certainly are those who try to force their personal preference on others but try to ignore them. I am perfectly fine reading a fic that involves rape. It is a horrible reality in life and can be a powerful event with some deep emotional trauma if written properly.
