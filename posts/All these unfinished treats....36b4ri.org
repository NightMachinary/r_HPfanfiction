Just "finished" reading How to Save Harry, a HP/HG fic at this link [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/7316864/1]]. I have a feeling it was posted on this sub and that's how i stumbled upon it...

For some reason the author has taken the story down? It isn't finished and yet the authors notes seem to indicate an intent to finish the story.

Any ideas on whether or not it was finished?


** Not that I can find. With a bit of luck, the author pulled it down to finish writing it before putting it back up. Another possibility is that the ff.net admins pulled it. I know they do that with some over M rated stuff.

I actually haven't read this story yet so I hit it with a download script in case it vanishes from fictionhunt.

**** Most of the stuff I read is on fanfiction.net so I just use [[http://www.fanfictiondownloader.net/download.php][FanFictionDownloader]].

[[http://www.fanfictiondownloader.net/archives.php][Here]] is the list of sites it supports.

I haven't used fictionhunt.com before but I just did a really simple 1 line script.

#+begin_example
  curl -O http://fictionhunt.com/read/7316864/[1-16]
#+end_example

It basically spits 16 files that have chapter number for the file name. I manually create a folder with the proper title and drop them all in.

If you use fictionhunt.com a lot, let me know. I can probably make a script that would automate more of it.

***** Honestly, i just love reading 17+ HG/HP fics, well written or not. I've been trying to amass a collection, over loads of different sites. I'll have to turn this bookmarks bar into files. I can't thank you enough for enlightening me.

If you have any suggestions for me i'd be grateful as well i seem to be running out of stories over 100k words!

***** How do you get around the ff.net copy protection? Disable Javascript?

Click it when you're on a ff.net site and copy/paste to your heart's content. Edit: probably won't work on mobile browsers due to how they implement bookmarks, sorry mobile readers.

For fanfiction downloader apps and my personal scripts, they don't implement Javascript when saving the files and ff.net still gives you the raw story, they just use a bit of JS to disable highlighting.
