im remaking this post cause i remembered way more about the plot, sorry if it seems im spamming but that is not my intention. in this fanfic harry was taken to a different school other than hogwarts turning to more unique magics, one of the plot points being the harry would join the school at age 10 instead of 11 and they would get their wand at the school. the wand could also become an instrument because they would learn to channel their magic though music. harry starts to become darker in this story and even at one point controls a whole crowd of people with his music. at the end of the fanfic he uses the music again to power a ritualistic spell that kills almost every muggle in existence leaving a few across the world for the vampires he has allied to him.
