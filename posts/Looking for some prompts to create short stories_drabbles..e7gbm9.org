Not an author for FF, wrote a bit on RR before starting to read FF. I don't have the drive right now to get any real decent sized stories going though I have several outlines already. Hoping some prompts getting me started writing will spur me on. So please reply with any prompt ideas you may have in this thread and I will make some drabbles in response to any that catch my eye!

Thanks.

Edit: Thoughts and reviews always loved!


** - Hermione and Luna are stargazing and see a UFO
- The Muggles of St. Ottery Catterpole long ago figured out some of their neighbors are wizards.
- Draco Malfoy, trying to win some credit in Krum's eyes, voices admiration for Voldemort, comparing him to Grindelwald. Viktor Krum is not particularly charitable in retaliation.

- Hogwarts has a new head of the Hospital Wing--a grouchy American named Dr. Cox
- Rather than using hippogriffs for his first Care of Magical Creatures class, Hagrid shows the third-year students Fluffy.
- In the skirmish at Malfoy Manor, Dobby disarms Draco before helping Harry Potter escape. Dobby the House Elf is now Master of the Elder Wand.
- Dudley Dursley vows to destroy Lord Voldemort because Voldemort is "bullying" Potter and only Dudley gets to do that.
- While studying at Smeltings, Dudley catches a schoolmate writing a letter to their Muggle-born sibling at Hogwarts.
- After Professor McGonagall is stunned trying to defend him, Hagrid kills Umbridge.
- While fetching the Philosopher's Stone from Gringotts Bank, Hagrid, Harry and Griphook walk in on Quirrell attempting to steal it.
- While Harry and Ron rescue Hermione from the troll in the girls' bathroom, the troll smashes several sinks, revealing the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets
- Ginny invites Luna to spend some time at the Burrow after "Order of the Phoenix." After she arrives, it becomes abundantly clear that this is Luna's first sleepover.

*** Dudley saw the owl wing it's way into the room of his roommate late at night that first week. Seeing the thick paper he knew it was related to those magic folks. Curling up his fist around his beating stick he knocked Terrence in the stomach forcing the boy to the ground.

"You one of those magic freaks? Just like my freaky cousin! With your stupid owls and ruddy magic garbage! Huh!"

Terrence looked up in shock at Dudley before reaching out and snatching Dudleys beating stick. He then proceeded to beat the hell out of Dudley showing the boy his what for.

"My brother is not a freak you fat bastard! He's a bloody good wizard he is. You talk anymore shit about him and I'll have him turn your fat ass into toad I will!"

Terrence was pissed Dudley had been such a been such a prat like that he thought of something else. Dudley had called his cousin a freak and gotten violent real quick. There was something more going on there and he would find out.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Jeremiah Fastings, Hufflepuff 6th year prefect and muggleborn wizard smiled as his brothers return letter owled in the weekend after his first week back. They always wrote to each other often. Even though Terrence wasn't a wizard there was no hard feelings in the family.

His smile began to turn down as he read more and more about the treatment of that had happened to the cousin of his brothers roommate growing up. His smile dis-the-fuck-appeared when he got to the name of said cousin, bloody Harry Potter, bugger.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Professor Sprout could not remember the last time her Puffs had called a full house council before the end of the first week. Whatever it was she knew it was going to be important.

As she read the letter handed to her by a 6th prefect she had only one thing to say "Bloody Hell".

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Amelia Bones got off the floo from Pomona and knew shit was about to hit the fan. Harry Potter, abused by his muggle relatives. Oh were the blood purists going to love this. Hell Dumbledore had assured the Wizarding World repeatedly that Harry was doing wonderful over the years. This was going to be a blood bath, possibly in a more literal sense before it was all over.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What had started as a letter had grown into no less than three separate calling of blood feuds between house, two declarations of war from alliances and the near total destruction of the ministry of magic in only four months.

At the center of it all Harry Potter was being championed by all sides, progressives, traditionalists, blood purist, muggleborn, the light, the dark, hell even the neutral houses where throwing his name up in their cause.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Age 11 Harry Potter elected Youngest Minister of Magic ever. This is incredible not only because he was the youngest by almost two decades, also because he had never in fact ran for minister to begin with.

*** "Oh look! A migrating wrackspurt, that's ever so rare Hermione!"

Hermione looked up where Luna was pointing and saw the moving light. At first she thought it perhaps was a airplane or helicopter. Then realized the magic in the area prevented that.

Narrowing her eyes in though she sat up and grabbed a telescope from the storage area. Focusing on the light she dropped her jaw in amazement.

"Luna that's not a wrackspurt, that's a... well it's a ufo!"

"Eweffoh? Are you sure you're not making that up Hermione? I've never heard of such a creature before. Hmmm... Perhaps the offspring of a Japed Wing Sheep and a Flobberworm? Oh goodie I must write to father at once! He will be most excited, thanks Hermione!"

Still in shock at seeing the large space ship of clearly alien design Hermoine could only mumble something semi coherent while waving off Luna.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hermione Granger, Fist of Thandor, Blood Crowned Primarch of Chenstil, and Lord of the Kolduore Armed Regiment looked down upon the backwater primitive world below her.

The world of her birth was of less value than a minor rounding error in her armies monthly food budget. With a nod of her head she sent forth her armies.

When she had left that fateful night she had avoided a most horrible fate. Death Eaters and Voldemort himself had invaded the castle later that year. Her friends and parents dead, the ministry of magic felled to Riddle and the world now engulfed in war.

Well less a true war by her standards, nothing more than a minor little dust up. There was nothing of any true emotional value to her here. Still wizards were an excellent resource for her armies and she planned to make them hers.

*** By one of the first decrees set forth by the ICW all wands were created so that only a witch or wizard could use them. In fact it was only due to Fleur having a father who was the French DMLE director that he had managed a loophole as her father for her and her sister to have a wand. Veela breed true and there are no such things as half Veela.

All wands from before the decree had been modified or destroyed most judiciously. All except for one that is, the single greatest wand in existence. Wood from the tree sitting in the center of spring from which the river Lethe started. Core of freely given essence of Death itself.

Now rightfully owned by a house elf named Dobby after protecting Wonderful Great Harry Potter Sir from Bad Former Master!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

House elves have a symbiotic relationship with witches and wizards. Their bodies bind with the magic of a witch, wizard or magical place, granting them power and life in exchange for service.

When Dobby held the elder wand as rightful owner he bound himself to a prime essence of magic itself. Magic and power would be his to command, to control. The price of his bond was an eternity of service to Death itself.

Death had found itself a champion to issue forth its will in the mad house elf Dobby. Fate and Destiny threw their hands up writing off this universe. It was now officially beyond saving.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Edit for minor continuation:

Death hit his head on his desk attempting to kill the unkillable via banging his head until it all just stopped.

Dobby was such a wonderfully dedicated little bugger. To dedicated in fact. So when death had asked for some help with all the paperwork dealing with all the deaths Dobby had offered to fix the problem.

Calling up the soul of the Flamels Dobby had learned the secrets of the Stone. Through 'borrowing' deaths scepter he had implanted into the minds of every sapient being in the universe on how to create the damn stones.

No more death no more paperwork! Dobby was best helper at helping ever!

*** "How often do you check the vaults?" Harry was nervous to ask but did anyways.

Griphook smiled a vile tooth filled smirk as he replied.

"Once every ten years..."

Griphook had wanted to continue messing with the little wizard except he was interrupted by said wizard.

"Bloody Hell! Have you been in there ten years! I hate going a week without food, incould never imagine ten years!"

Quirrel looked up from where he had the stone in hand and stared out as Hagrid, Griphook and young Harry stared in.

With a snap of his fingers Griphook enabled the lockdown protocol for the Vault. Nothing was getting in or out for at least a decade. Especially as it was the Flamel Vault they were locking it down until they came themselves to get it.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The stone had kept Quirrel alive, through the indeterminate years of silence and darkness. The lockdown protocols had even kept Voldemorts spirit from being able to leave.

The Vault finally cracked open one day and they looked out for the first time in forever.

"Well your options are I close this door for another century or you submit to a trial."

Voldemort took the chance to flee through the opened door only to hit a barrier bouncing him back.

As the door began to close he heard the stranger outside say.

"Better make it two centuries just to make sure."

*** The twins looked at each other and looked at their new brother.

"Well" "Dearest" "Brother"

All three looked at each other. They felt the connection, it was full and strong. Where once there was two now there was three.

As one Fred, George, and the newly named Loki spoke words that would shake Hogwarts to its foundations in fear if heard by any others.

"Brilliant!"

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The twins had been checked for temporal residue by Dumbledore himself. They had solid alibis for the entirety of the prank. Still somehow one of them had gotten out of potions detention, snuck into Slytherin Dormitory, and filled it with Egyptian Burrowing Fleas.

So Slytherin was on quarantine for at least a month while there was zero proof tying the twins to the prank.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It was the greatest secret of the triplets, that they were in fact triplets. So when Loki had died impersonating Fred it had been a major blow to the once again twins. They had lost a true part of themselves once again and also had no way to tell everyone Fred still lived.

Still it was a good prank overall, they just had to play it carefully for the next century or so. Loki their brother would have wanted it that way, of that they had no doubt.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Loki looked over at his brother Odin smirking as he did so.

"Even with my 'death' they still hold to the prank. Told you they were true worshippers to my mantle."

Odin laughed as he tossed the Frozen Heart Crystal over to his brother.

"Should have known better than to bet against the Father of Tricksters on who is most faithful was!"

They left the viewing hall as they rounded off to get some mead for the night.

*** Draco knew he was screwed as he looked about the courtroom. His wand clearly showed he had cast the spells even if he had no memories of the time.

The court saw the evidence clearly as Draco burst into the Great Hall flinging killing curses all over the students of House Slytherin. He had been found minutes later oblivated and sitting in an empty classroom.

This was the sixth instance of what was being called Slytherins Madness Curse this school year and it wasn't even the Yule Ball yet!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the Tournament wanted to give him legal immunity to do whatever he wanted Harry was going to go all out this year.

Still better safe than sorry, and taking some knowledge learned about Oblivate after last year with what they learned making bathroom polyjuice second year. Well the results were paying off in spades so far.

*** Professor Slughorn was a large man, not overly fat but large still. Harry scratched his head in thought over this. It was in fact the first fat wizard he had ever met.

"Hermione, why are there not really any fat wizards or witches?"

Hermione looked up with an answer on her lips only to pause.

"Uh, I don't actually know. Come Harry let's go to the Library!"

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After several days of research they had finally found their answer buried in an obscure book telling about New Zeland Warrior Mages.

"So the more a Magic Users uses their magic the more physical energy it burns. However the more they use it the more efficiently they are at using it. So Umbridge and Slughorn rarely use it and are rather obese. Aurors use it often and are rather physically fit."

They had the answer and Harry had an idea.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Harry Potter had spent the time from the beginning of the year to now taking nutrient, growth, muscle healing, skelegrow and other potions daily. Before every meal and bed each night Harry would cast spells until near exhaustion. The potions and heavy meals getting the required calories along with the nutrients to sustain the exhausting schedule.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Malfoy stepped back as he let the Death Eaters in the Castle through the cabinet. His nervousness clear for them all to see.

"Oh is baby Draco scared of his Auntie!" His crazed aunt cackled as she got in uncomfortably close.

"Ummmm no Aunt Bellatrix, it's just I'm sure Harry Potter is nearby and has an idea something is going on."

A broken smile twisted across her face as she replied with glee.

"Oh goodie, I won't have to track the little half-blood down!" Bounding out of the room she made in into the corridor only to stop and stare.

Before her stood a gaint of a man, reaching near 8ft the magic radiating off him was physically visible.

Whoever this god of magic was she knew he was going to smash her like a frog under a carriage.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Harry smiled as he swatted aside the spells coming his way from Riddle. Conjuring shields for any unforgivables and letting his magic squash any other spells sent his way.

"Time to die Riddle!" Harry's deep voice resonated within the bones of everyone within nearly a league of him. His voice itself carried waves of magic

Harry Potter was a being of magic itself now. Far beyond any magics used in the modern wizarding world he was a primal being of magic itself.

This is based on a story I have an outline on. Where first year Harry finds a book detailing the history of giants around the world. Wizards how have through various means changed themselves over time to become something else.

Groups of various Celtic wizards long ago turned their magic inwards forcing themselves into warriors of great strength, height and endurance sacrificing strength of mind for strength of body.

Jotuns turned to the elements and took on aspects of ice. Titans were wizards how took on primal aspects of the universe to grow in strength.

South American Giant Kings (real thing actually) took on greater forms to better rule.

When I get the the inspiration to write it out should be a good read. Have powerful enemies lined up, trials to overcome and some light crack thought up.

*** Harry Potter was not a nice person in reality. He had adopted an outward expression of nicety as a survival mechanism. The less his relatives saw their behavior affected him the less they attacked him.

Harry Potter was in fact a violent little shit who was simply highly wary of pissing off those with the power to fuck him up. Justin's comment had set his mind spinning. He knew from talking to Ron that his vault had far more galleons than most wizards made in a life time.

Ron was about as useful as a wart on a frog asking where to get an assassin from but Harry had an idea.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Of course Hagrid had been right, Goblins were vicious greedy beasts. Which the bill for pest extermination in his hand more than proved. He smiled up at the Head Table seeing the new potions Professor.

Smiling at Justin he slid the parchment over, they had agreed to go halvsies afterall.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By their fourth year Hogwarts rumor mill had the dada curse spreading throughout the school. Two headmasters, three dada teachers, four muggle studies teachers, a charms professor, every slytherin prefect so far, hell half of slytherin in fact, and the entire Hogwarts board of directors had been replaced five times.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The goblins loved young benefactors Potter and Finch-Fletchely. Getting paid to kill blood purists, exorcising goblin hating Binns, and take out over half the ministry had been profitable on many fronts. With the ending of so many lines Gringotts had split the contents of the vaults with the boys. Which brought more jobs to young goblins looking to make their mark and cleaned up the wizarding world a bit more each time.

*** It had started innocently enough, Grandma Greengrass had gotten careless with an African Stangler and it had lived up to the name.

No one was surprised when Grandpa Greengrass followed shortly afterwards. They had loved each other dearly.

What had been a surprise was when some new bags of dragon dung for fertilizer had reacted badly killing six others of the Greengrass family.

When her parents had both died within minutes of getting stung by Moonflower Thistle rumors started flying.

Now Astoria sat calmly in her room waiting for the end to come for her. Over the last year every last one of the Greengrass family had perished.

She was the last one and she would face it with her chin held high.

Slowly she noticed a form standing in the darkened corners of the room. After several moments she made out the figure.

"Of course, should have realized it earlier. Fair play, at least I will die knowing why."

There stood Neville Longbottom, the Lord of the once great Longbottom farms. Farms her family had stolen during Voldemorts second war and managed to keep afterwards through bribes.

Neville raised his wand as she looked on resolute in the face of her oncoming death. Smirking to himself he cast the curse ending the line of Greengrass once and for all.
