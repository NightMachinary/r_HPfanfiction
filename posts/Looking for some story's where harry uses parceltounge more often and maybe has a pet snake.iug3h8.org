** Try the Psychic Serpent Trilogy

It's an adaption for books 5, 6 and 7 and all novel length. Quality is very very good and can easily be read as alternative books. Rumor says JKR read that ff, too.

Interesting fact: The whole trilogy has been released before OotP

** Check out "A Very Slytherin Harry" series by geoffaree

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/737220]]

and the "Like none other" series by AspenInTheSunlight

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/41198]]

In both stories Snape ends up adopting Harry, so lots of the plot is focused on that, But there is more to it and both stories are very good.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the prince of slytherin) linkffn(Harry Potter and the ashes of chaos) linkao3(sarcasm & Slytherin) He only has a pet snake in the AO3 story, but Parseltongue is more important in all of these. Ashes of Chaos is still sort of early on, but Parseltongue looks like it will be very important in time.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  AU: When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween night, she not only created a living legend in Charlus Potter, The Boy Who Lived, but she touched the life of another just as deeply. What will happen when a more jaded, more focused, and more gifted Harry Potter shows up at Hogwarts in 1991 after being abandoned and forgotten? Fem!Voldemort, WBWL
