He did not tell anybody about Sirius' animagus condition, he ran out on Tonks and Teddy ( in the Deathly Hallows) and he stood by when the Marauders bullied Snape. Note that Snape did the same when Mulciber and Avery harrassed Muggleborns.


** I don't think a Lupin bashing fic has ever been written ðŸ˜®

*** I've read quite a few Slytherin!Harry fics that highlight his faults, though I don't know that I'd call that bashing since even in those fics he was still written as trying his best and having good intentions.

** Tonks browbeat him into a relationship he didn't want, and a child he didn't want to blight with his condition.

Also Snape deserved it.

** It's a brief/minor element, and I'm not sure it quite rises to the level of bashing, but linkffn(Faery Heroes) is awesome and happens to have a time-traveling Harry being very much not a Remus Lupin fan.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny

** He gets bashed some in linkffn(To Become A Muggle by lifebitten). I've read a couple of others where Harry is not at all happy with him, but I can't remember the titles, offhand.
