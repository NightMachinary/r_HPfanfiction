** I didn't finish Azoth but I liked what I read and it's very commonly recommended. I haven't read Helix but my friend whose tastes I trust recommended it and I'm sure it's good.

  Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts with Hermione for eighth year, he realises that something's missing from his life, and it either has to do with Ron, his boggart, Snape, or Malfoy. Furthermore, what, exactly, does it mean when one's life is defined by the desire to simultaneously impress and annoy a portrait? Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care.
