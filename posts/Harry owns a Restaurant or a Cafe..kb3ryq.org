Any stories where Harry owns a Restaurant or a Cafe? No homosexual relationships because there are lot of them. Thanks.


** Marvel crossover where adult and badass harry moves to NYC and opens up a british-style pub. SHIELD /kinda/ knows about him and magic. His relationship with Captain America is purely one of friendship.

  Steve has a routine, and god help him if he's going to break that routine for anyone - yes, that includes you, Tony. Enter a local barkeeper with a penchant for the occult and the gift of good conversation. EWE, not slash, just a couple of guys and a few hundred drinks. Rated for fear of the thought police.

** linkffn(Heroes Assemble) -- Harry sets up a cafe in the early part of the story. Doesn't stay relevant throughout the story, but it's used and mentioned regularly up until about the halfway point or so.

  After five years travelling the world, Harry Potter has landed in New York. He figures that there's no better place than the city that never sleeps to settle in and forge a new life. If only the heroes, villains, aliens and spies had received the message. Begins just before the Avengers movie and continues through the MCU. Encompasses MCU movies & TV, some others along the way.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18824134/chapters/44668678]]) A slash relationship is tagged but I can't recall anything romantic from this fic. The "families of choice" tag fits much better as a description.
