This may be a common question on this sub, but I absolutely adore most series rewrites. I've been obsessed with Leo Inter Serpentes---a fantastic rewrite with Harry in Slytherin and the Drarry pairing---for the past few years, and I'm looking for something similar in which the author rewrites the series.

Would really love Slytherin!Harry and for the fic to be on AO3, but I honestly don't mind anything. Would love to hear any recommendations.


** Linkao3(Certain Dark Things) Is my goto fic for Non-political Slytherin!Harry. Refreshing AU Retelling. Active updates.

Linkffn(Saving Connor) Is a Slytherin!WBWL style fic with a lot more politics. 3072k words and complete. Read this if you want never-ending epics.

Linkffn(To Be Slytherin) Harry has a fraternal twin Retelling of the series. Complete with length comparable to canon.

Linkao3(Antithesis by Oceanbreeze) My goto Slytherin!Dark!Harry fic. WBWL tragedy.

Linkao3(Harry Potter And The Bucket List) Self-insert rewrite. Presently in 6th year.

  They sought her out for conversation sometimes, cornering her in the garden or at the park, not that they ever had much to say. Really, Harriet thought snakes were rather dull.---------Harriet Potter has always been odd. Between having a shadow that moves on its own and chatting with grass snakes, learning she's a witch really isn't the strangest thing to happen to the bespectacled girl with a lightning scar on her neck. Harriet attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where she makes new friends, encounters a prickly Potions Master, learns about the Boy Who Lived, and meets the enigmatic Defense Against the Dark Arts instructor, Professor Tom Slytherin.

  Being reincarnated as Harry Potter's fraternal twin sister really puts a new meaning behind "death is but the next great adventure."Updates every Thursday and occasional Sunday. No relationships prior to year four.

** OK- this is not a Drarry- it's a Gen Fic- but one of my favorite Harry as a Slytherin is called “A Learning Experience”- it is an amazing fic that creates an incredible representation of Slytherin culture from the inside- it does justice I think to a lot of characters, including Snape as a stern, but ultimately super devoted Housemaster trying to save his snakes from ending up on the dark side. There's no sexual relationship between Harry & Draco, but there's a very interesting dynamic where Harry is a vital part of pulling Draco back from the dark side, despite some of their initial rivalry.

It's super well written, with three fics in the series and over 500K+ words so it's a solid read. If you're OK without the overt slash- this gives a great portrayal of Slytherin Harry, Snape, Draco and some of the other characters of Slytherin.

Sadly not on AO3- but it's on FFN.

  How would things have been if Harry had got to know Snape and his Snakes better? A 'Harry in Slytherin' story. Don't groan; it's not that bad! Warnings: mention of sex later on (very mild); typical teenage swearing (mild) and corporal punishment (not graphic or extreme). (Note: the beginning is heavily inspired by Asterix Tutnix.)

  In the middle of their second year, Draco and Harry discover they're soulmates and do their best to keep it a secret from everyone. Their best isn't perfect. ~“Are you trying to get killed, Potter?” Malfoy drawls, stalking forward. Quick as a serpent himself, he reaches out and grabs the snake just below the head. It thrashes in his grip, but is no longer able to bite anyone. “This is a poisonous snake, and I doubt anyone brought a bezoar with them.” Harry glares. He opens his mouth, and feels the beginning the snake's language pass his lips, and this isn't what he wants, what's the point of insulting Malfoy if he can't understand him -- Malfoy's eyes widen. He slaps his hand over Harry's mouth, “Potter, what the hell--”~(Now with a TV Tropes page!)
