  A Death Eater finds Harry two years before he leaves for Hogwarts, and that assassination attempt sets Harry on a course that will shake the Wizarding World to its foundations. Pulled in two directions by opposing sides, Harry must decide which path to walk.

  The war against the Dark Lord was the last straw. The oppressed, fed up with oligarchy, corruption, and injustice, sharpened their knives, rallying behind those who promised change. They won. Today, Magical Britain is a changed country -- for the better. Hail and praise to our saviours! Finally, all is well. But listen! Can't you hear the grindstone turning still ...?

  Harry Potter is a geek, a nerd, a total dork whose favorite hobby is "transfiguring stuff." He doesn't understand what rules are, has no social skills, is barely sentient, and is very smart.

**** the problem is we never see a real standard. Harry manages to teach the DA just about all the spells he knows, everybody seems capable of being just as good and he doesn't do anything really special other than his patronus which he only uses once before everyone else learns it in a week.

***** I think somewhere in this subreddit Harry was identified as a Kinaesthetic, or how ever you spell it, learner. He's no prodigy, but once he learns the movements gets it down in a relatively short amount of time.
