** linkffn(7104491) A short and sweet one-shot where Harry sees a Star Wars movie and "realizes" that he's a Jedi. It's only 5k words so seriously give this a shot! You won't regret it.

  At age eight, Harry Potter had an epiphany. He realized, with the utter certainty that only an eight years old can have, that he was a Jedi.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

#+begin_quote
  The story of a Harry Potter who read comics, and loved his superheroes. Fairly close to canon, just with a Harry who has an interesting and fun motivation to learn, and to delve into the world of magic. Featuring a slightly smarter Harry, with a unique view on how to live his life in the wizarding world. T for cursing maybe? T to be safe for later on.

#+begin_quote
  Harry takes inspiration from a manga called Fairy Tail, as well as the great creation we call "The Internet". What follows is a different path taken. A path of strife, rebellion, and above all, power. Welcome to the New Age. Timeline moved to the 2010s. Eventual X-over with Devil May Cry 3, Stargate: SG-1, Smallville, Dresden Files and Ranma.

  Instead of ignoring the unnatural for the believable, Harry understood that he was different and embraced it. Harry will introduce changes to the world around him, and wont accept how things are 'supposed' to be. Don't expect regular updates, but they will come.
