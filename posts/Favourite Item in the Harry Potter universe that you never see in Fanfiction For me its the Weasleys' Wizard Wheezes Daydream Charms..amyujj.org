The Daydream Charms are only mentioned like once in the sixth book but they are still one of if not my favourite magic item mentioned int the series.


** Dark Detectors for me. Foe Glasses, Secrecy Sensors, and Sneakoscopes. They seem like a clean and sensible way to derail canon plot points like Scabbers, Fake Moody, or the cursed opal necklace, without the benefit of a Peggy-Sue protagonist who knows everything... So I guess that's why they're hardly ever used.

Same reason why nobody tells the teachers anything, or why the teachers---if told---never listen.

This thread basically boils down to a list of all the items and spells that were introduced in the series, either forgotten, ignored, ineffectual, or irrelevant to the canon plot... that we wished were used /effectively/ in fanfiction.

God damn, I would totally enjoy Neville's Remembrall being used for more than a way to get Harry onto the Quidditch team.

For example, in "Blood Crest" holding a Remembrall while learning something new makes it easier for the holder's mind to recall the information later. In "Prince of Slytherin" a Remembrall lets someone know when they have been Obliviated, and smashing the ball when it turns fully red restores the reconstructed memory.

Their problem was not a lack of food in the absolute sense. The context of the discussion about Gamp's law is that Harry has caught some fish and Hermione has collected some mushrooms.

Their problem is a lack of /good/ food i.e. their inability to transform the ingredients into something that is nice to eat. Gamp's law is quoted to explain why they also can't just conjure up a plate of ready-to-eat food.

It seems clear that you can't use magic to turn rotten food fresh. So you can't take an item of fresh food and duplicate it forever, because the duplicates will only be as fresh as the original. Which means all the duplicates will expire in the same period of time as the original would have.

In canon, they actually bought canned food, but didn't think of duplicating it so that they'd have a supply around for the bad days when they couldn't find anything through scavenging. That's the bit that frustrates me about the books.

***** I've seen lots of fanon explanations for why spells aren't used like that.

For example, in fanfiction "Gamp's Laws" are often expanded to explain why magic can't be used to make food in any way, not even by duplication.

Some fics explain that transfiguration, summoning and vanishing etc. can't be used directly on an opponent because the opponent's magic within their body resists the foreign influence.

Basically, these are all attempts to put natural laws around magic so spells are less OP and make more sense with what we observe of the canon world. (If people could duplicate food at will and make high quality clothing and shelter from nothing, why are there any poor wizards? etc.)

****** Gamp's Laws are actually a canon thing, but it's canon that you can loophole it by duplicating/enlarging food you already have, because it's impossible to create it from nothing.

*Chapter 15, "The Goblin's Revenge", Deathly Hallows.*

#+begin_quote
  ‘Your mother can't produce food out of thin air,' said Hermione. ‘No one can. Food is the first of the five Principal Exceptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfigur---'

  ‘Oh, speak English, can't you?' Ron said, prising a fishbone out from between his teeth.

  ‘It's impossible to make good food out of nothing! You can Summon it if you know where it is, you can transform it, *you can increase the quantity* if you've already got some---'

  ‘- Well, don't bother increasing this, it's disgusting,' said Ron.
#+end_quote

It bothers me less if a fanfic tries to find a way to invalidate or re-interpret the Laws so Hermione can't duplicate the food, than it does that Hermione of canon doesn't do it when they're obviously starving. She prides herself on finding logical solutions to problems, but the plot handed her (and everyone else) an Idiot Ball there.

*** I assume it's more like what Krum did, but done properly. Full human transfiguration other than Animagi is possibly, just difficult and dangerous.

** Those daydream charms can be dystopian nightmares if you want them to be... :o Give them to criminals and custom tailor them to be HELLSCAPES, and then you don't even NEED Azkaban!!! Just throw them in an empty room and let their mind exist in a nightmare of inescapable pain and torment, for which it will last CENTURIES inside the dream but be only a few days in real life!!!
