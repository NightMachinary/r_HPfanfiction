So I really enjoyed the premise of magical baking in the sadly too short Story: The Dark Mark [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11084347/1/The-Dark-Mark]]

I'd really like something similar but it could be based around most any character and does not have to be romantic in nature.

#+begin_quote
  A freak accident with Arthur's enchanted Ford Anglia causes a minor explosion and a major change in the Weasley household. With Arthur in a coma and Molly having passed away, Bill and Charlie can't afford to quit their jobs and must support the family from afar. Thus, it falls to Percy to handle the day-to-day, even if he's not sure that he can.
