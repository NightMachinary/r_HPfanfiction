So yeah, are there any bad cliches that you have only just noticed in the past year or so? They could be a new thing, or have just gained popularity. I like to think that mostbad cliches have been pruned from the fandom but hindsight is 20/20.


** I've seen a pretty big popup of genderbent Harry fics, and a HUGE amount of SnapexHermione stuff. I dont mind a female Harry every now and again, especially when they are well written, but I hateHATEhate any main character being anything other than a student to Snape without some SERIOUS and well written changes. Like yeah, I get it, everybody loves Alan Rickman, but Snape isn't Alan. Snape looks like you basically took a shutin, chemist, nazi; ran him through the La Brea Tarpits then set him in the grease trap of the cumulative McDonalds chain. He isn't a person ANYONE would want as a significant other, let alone anything significant in the first place.

Because those fanfictions are written about actual teenage girls with a crush on their fanonized idea of Snape, and so if they want to identify with the main character whom they're shipping with said Snape, it better be a teenage girl too. And they're crushing on Rickman's /adult/ Snape, so they don't /want/ some wussy teenage version of /him/.

Nor a bad thing from the point of view of the student if they are into it (which is the common PoV in Fanfics).

Not that I think that Snape doesn't belong behind bars or should be allowed near kids, but it should be for being a member of the magical Waffen-SS, not for sleeping with a student.

Admittedly, there's a difference when the student is male or female. There are plenty of interviews with these "rape victims" and pretty much none of the guys complains about what happened to them. Hell, the French President ended up marrying his teacher, who was 39 when she seduced him aged 15.

** You know, maybe it's because I'm a lot more selective about the fics I read now than I used to be, but I can't really think of any new trope that has taken the fandom by storm in the last few years. When the apartment-trunk was created, it spread from fic to fic like wildfire, but there really isn't any recent equivalent.

It's interesting, because while the volume of new HP fanfiction has dropped, it's still one of the most prolific fandoms out there, so there's certainly enough people writing that ideas /could/ spread. Nor would I say that the fandom has exhausted ideas -- in fact, the HP fandom tends to tell the same stories again and again with minor variations, so there remain oceans of unused ideas.

Perhaps the lack of new tropes speaks to the increased compartmentalisation of the fandom, where people stick to their corner and read just a small category of fics. This would prevent the transmission of ideas from one sub-fandom to another.

- Some interesting ideas...

- They meet and/or go on a couple of adventures together...

Welll... hardcore killer, no. But given her proficiency with the Cruciatus and general unhingedness, it seems entirely likely that Rowling meant for us to assume she's just a born sadist and emotionally unstable, and would have eventually given in and done something horrible even if she hadn't had her Lord around to validate her.

**** Most of her fans consider her attractive in the movies 5 - 7 as well (at least judging by the Bellamione tumblr community).

But I'd argue that it's not that much about attractiveness, it's that she, despite being a member of the magical Waffen-SS, still is probably one of the most badass characters in the series. It's cool evil, like Darth Vader. The other Death Eaters aren't much of a threat compared to her. Especially Malfoy, who was rather pathetic when it came to fulfilling his dream, or Snape, who was petty enough to abuse school children on a regular basis.

*** I'm using something similar in most of my fics simply because it makes for a better story. Admittedly, Andromeda is a biased narrator, but "slowly losing your sister to Voldemort's madness" is a better story than "she was always evil, so I'm not surprised that she became Voldemort's right hand". And Andromeda feels responsible since her marriage with Ted made her family push Bella to Lestrange.

I'm not claiming that she was a Saint before, but there's a difference between a teenager who occasionally beats people up with magic over perceived wrongs or in defense of her sisters and torturing people into insanity for the magical Nazis.

**** I've never seen it used as an argument for pureblood supremacy, but I have seen fics that explore the idea of wizarding genetics. In those cases, the take away is that to improve the size/stability of the wizarding population...

- Wizards shouldn't breed with muggles.
- Squibs should be encouraged to stay in wizarding society rather than marry muggles, that way the statute of secrecy is less at risk from wizard children popping up in muggle homes.
- Marrying muggleborns is beneficial to decrease the inbreeding coefficient of "pureblood" lines.

So most of those stories push the idea that niether the pureblood faction nor their opponents were entirely right.

***** I'm not an expert in the field but my intuitive understanding would be that marrying muggles is crucial for both the gene pool and the population size. Perhaps not every witch or wizard should marry a muggle but it has to happen often enough. And for squibs staying in the wizarding world and pure-bloods marrying muggleborns for the gene diversity: Wasn't the whole /premise/ of this that muggleborns are descendants of squibs? Where are those muggleborns supposed to come from if the squibs don't marry muggles?

****** In those fics usually only the "Sacred Twenty-Eight" families have high inbreeding coefficients. If the population of Wizarding Britain is around 20k+, then there are enough wizards that they could intermarry with less infamous families without issues. Also, they could marry into families from other parts of the world to cut down the problem even more. In the meantime, marrying muggleborns is a stop-gap measure to quickly diversify the genepool without watering down the "wizard gene" (whatever that might be in the fic).

The intended result is that no new squibs will be born (because squibs are caused by too much inbreeding), and no new muggleborns will be born because squibs would no longer be marrying muggles.
