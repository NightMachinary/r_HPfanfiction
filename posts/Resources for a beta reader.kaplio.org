:END:
Hey everyone! Nearly finished a one shot that'll be around 11-12k. I'd really appreciate somewhere to look for a beta reader for it, but can't find a solid resource for them online.

It's told in different sections of a character's life (Harry's reborn as James' younger sister who's a seer, go with me if you can) so I'd like outsider opinion on what order to place these sections and if any more points/relationships need fleshing out.

If anyone has any pointers on where to hunt down a casual look-over beta, I'd really appreciate the help! Thanks.
