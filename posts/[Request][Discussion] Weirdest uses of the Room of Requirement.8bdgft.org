What are some of the weirdest use(s) for the Room of Requirement you have come across or thought up?

Wasn't sure which tag to use so I just used the two that came closest.


** Hmm...I was going to say a pottery classroom used in constructing a model used in animagus form development, but that's hardly weird at all.

Nor is using it as a sex dungeon...kinky and unusual, but not exactly weird.

From a certain perspective, any use of the Room of Requirement that furthers the story, even if it's only a relaxing backdrop for so-and-so characters talking, is a non-weird use.

So, I guess...to have a weird use of the Room of Requirement, it would have to be both unusual, and have no bearing on the plot. So not a backdrop for conversation or sex or training, not a place to pull an item from, not a place to use to illustrate something, not a place to do a project of some sort, but also not some other kind of logical room that might be used by non-viewpoint characters...

Well, I don't think it qualifies as weirdest (because it illustrates something), but:

  "I'm telling you, Hermione, it smelt awful! Like...hang on, we're passing the Room, gimme a moment."

  Ron paced back and forth, thinking, 'I need to explain to Hermione what IT smelt like.'

  The Room of Requirement's door appeared, and Ron pulled it open-

  "BLEEEERRGH!!"

  -to reveal a room, arranged oddly like a museum, with a large number of horrendous-smelling things on display like 'soiled troll loincloth', 'bouquet of corpse flowers', 'hydrogen sulfide', 'freshly-cut durian', and 'eau de skunk'.

  "Um..." Ron looked indecisive, trying to decide which one was the worst out of all the intermingling smells, paying no heed to Hermione projectile vomiting behind him, "I'll...it's like one of these. Do, uh...I guess I'll go do a sniff test and find out which one...~gulp~"

** My favourite one is the one where the Hogwarts elves use it for having sex in. There's a strict and busy schedule, which is why they call it the 'Come-and-Go' room.

Entirely can't remember the fic I saw that one in, not even any details about it.

** About the tag, I believe the discussion tag is the only correct one as a request flair is for requesting a type of fanfiction.

*** Thanks, the reason I even considered Request is because I want people to be able to link to a specific fanfiction(s).

I can always edit the OP if necessary.

Thank again!

** Well, once I saw the Room of Requirement poof all of Dumbledore's Army to the forests and fields that existed before Hogwarts was even founded. But I stupidly forgot to save the story, so I haven't been able to find it again.
