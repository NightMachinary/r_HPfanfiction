... Why doesn't Harry throw Voldemort/Wormtail's name into the Goblet of Fire and let it strip their magic away? I can't be the only one to think of this. Might make for a fun read if he did throw his enemy's names into the goblet.


** I think losing your magic if you don´t compete is a fanon thing, the books just say you have to compete because of a magically binding contract.

It still would be an interesting premise if they /have to/ compete. Proving Wormtail is alive? Well he´s gonna need to perform in front of an audience of hundrets! You could give it an interesting angle if Pettigrew finds a wayto make himself look like a tragic hero, he already has an order of merlin and seems to be a decent actor. Then Harry would need to expose the truth, without endangering Sirius. Goblet of Fire is a good platform for a battle of public opinion like that, because it sets up the role of media in the books and already has elements of it play a part,

I'd be interested to hear what makes you think Wormtail is a decent actor.

IIRC the only acting he does is the in the shack in book 3, and I'm fairly sure absolutely no one buys that.

I really like stories that subvert the binding magical contract, such as:

- The consequence of breaking the contract is simply that you aren't allowed to enter magical contracts ever again; Harry is all right with that. Walk Away by Hippothestrowl linkffn(13114303)
- Harry asks to see the slip of paper, and says that they should contact the Harry Potter who attends the listed school, which is clearly not him. Harry Potter and the Fourth School by Dalwyn linkffn(6311075)

Edited to add: the second one does involve Harry throwing Voldie's name into the Goblet. The author credits RobSt for being the first that he knows of to enter Voldie in the tournament, in Knowledge is Power.

  What if Harry just walks away from Hogwarts and the magical contract that binds him to the Tri-Wizard Tournament? A single tiny change to canon and we have a short, coming of age drama that eventually turns into a short love story. Harmony was meant to be. Brief Dumbledore & Hogwarts students bash and humiliation.

  The Goblet of Fire creates a magically binding contract, which means Harry must compete, or lose his magic... Hermione takes this to the logical conclusion.

** Then you have the short story Magical Contracts by Kalen Darkmoon where Harry decides to write a few magical contracts for his enemy.

Linkffn(3941656)

There are several stories where Harry uses the Goblet of Fire

You can try Knowledge is Power by RobSt a time travel story where Harry ensures Voldemort's name comes out of the Goblet of fire
