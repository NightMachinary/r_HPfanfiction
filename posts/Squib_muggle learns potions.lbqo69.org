As far as I remember, you didn't need to use magic for potions. You might to get some of the ingredients, but it's not necessary for the actual brewing. So what would prevent someone without magic from trying it out?

I have two ideas for how this might happen:

If they're a squib, they have access to this stuff already, and if their parents pay more attention to the magical kids (just speculation but I think it's totally plausible if they straight up ignored them like the Dursleys do to Harry in some fics), they'd have a lot of free time to experiment. Maybe set up a cauldron in some distant room of the house, if they're a rich family.

If they're a muggle, maybe this happens later, when they get married to a witch/wizard. I'm imagining they get fired from their job and are home earlier than usual. They start trying to organize some boxes while they wait for their spouse to get home, and come across spouse's Hogwarts books. They read through them, and eventually they decide they really want to try it out


** Generally potions are seen as needing magic to make them work - since the ingredients on their own don't really seem like they'd react in the way that potions do. Plus, of course, there's the fairly ridiculous procedures that need to be done /exactly/ right to make the potions correctly.

That all implies that potions require some amount of magical ability to create properly - either to 'activate' the ingredients, or to use their magic, or adding to it. That's how I've usually seen fics treat them.

It could be possible, if wanting a muggle/squib to make potions, to have some sort of spell that replicates magic for them in that case (eg - maybe a magic user could make a rock or brewing stick that imbues magic correctly).

** I don't recall any citation, where anybody would claim that Muggles/Squibs can make potions. Could you provide any?

From the author's point of view, I would rather they couldn't (and they couldn't use them), because otherwise you get into very nasty discussion, why magicals don't reveal their magical (in all meanings of the word) potions to Muggles and help them heal instantly with many ailments. “You mean you have a cure for the common flu and you haven't shared it with anybody? You can heal broken limbs overnight and you haven't told anybody? F*ck you stupid Statue of Secrecy! We are literally dying here!” That nuke pointing towards Hogwarts/Diagon Alley suddenly makes much more sense than before. I would rather avoid this discussion by Muggles not being able to make potions and/or consume them.

Having said that, I have written Ginny Potter healing a broken hand of James Potter's Muggle girlfriend in linkao3(23267857), and I am still thinking that Petunia (who turns out be a Squib) could make at least limited number of potions (for the more advanced ones you need transformation of ingredients) and she is actually pretty good in Herbology in [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/clanky/drafts/brother_and_sister.html][my unfinished story of Harry and Ginny being siblings]] (Petunia making potions comes originally from “Petunia Snaps by Meester Lee” linkffn(12551744)).

*** It's canon that potions work on muggles, since the Weasley twins gave Dudley a ton-tongue toffee with the expectation that it would work, which it did.

It's also canon that magic is hidden from muggles because magicals don't want to solve muggle problems, according to Hagrid when he first meets Harry. The magical world has no pretensions of being ethical. They knowingly let muggles suffer and die rather than solve their problems with magic.

***** As someone who has a passing familiarity with:

- X-men comics
- Marvel movies
- MCU

there is only one conclusion to be drawn: "Fuck muggles with a barbed wire!"

The human-first movements, the anti-mutant propaganda, the black ops, secret weapons projects... And semi-realistic storyline where an empowered group meets a more numerous non-empowered group, the 'muggle' group usually tries to make demands and/or control the empowered minority.

As muggles do not really have anything to offer the wizards (so no large-scale trade), are not good at resource management (overpopulation, waste, pollution, global warming, nuclear fallout), and are rather well armed and not overly concerned about collateral damage (we only have one planet, but some people have made regular attempts at rendering it uninhabitable).

Here's a quote by Agent K of Ben in Black fame:

#+begin_quote
  A person is smart. People are dumb, panicky dangerous animals and you know it. Fifteen hundred years ago everybody knew the Earth was the center of the universe.
#+end_quote

So any competent magical leader would take one look at the absolute steaming pile of garbage that is our world and make the executive decision to stay the fuck away! Because their first priority both moral, legal and practical, for the duration of their time in office, should be the wellbeing of THEIR people. Always. Helping others should be done in situations where that first priority, that Prime Directive, is not threathened.

Maybe some muggleborn cures their uncle of cancer. Maybe some wizard vanishes a landfill on a lark. Maybe someone charms a lump of metal to keep a temperature of -150 Celsius and kicks it into the arctic ocean. Small things that do not require to sacrifice their sons and daughters and aunts and uncles and fathers and mothers for a mob that would not appreciate it - or them.

Singular encounters and actions, sure. A full disclosure? In your nightmares.

*** In terms of Muggles/Squibs making potions and Rowling's citations, the answer is 'yes and no'.

According to Rowling, they can put things together in a pot and stir, but there comes a point when you need magic/wand-waving to make potions and that's where the Muggles/Squibs would falter.

**** And Muggles only or Squibs as well? There is that fanon theory, that Squibs have just less magic not none of it (like Muggles), so they can see Hogwarts (and therefore work there), see Dementors (e.g., Mrs Figg might not be lying after all), ghosts (again, Mr Filch), or exactly make some Potions. JKR didn't answer this theory there.

***** Same answer. Potions require wand-waving and wands don't work properly for Squibs, so they wouldn't be able to make potions properly.

If the wand-waving elements could be done first and then the materials could be given to a Squib and the recipe followed from there (like cooking a meal, then storing it away so someone else can reheat it later), then maybe they could. But if the wand-waving has to be done actively at a certain point in the brewing, then Squibs still wouldn't be able to make potions.

*** In linkffn(Mutant Storm by Bobmin356), at one point Harry explains that he has acquired the rights to market Pepper-Up to muggles, and explains that it's a cure for the common cold, and is part of his strategy for making wizards valuable to muggles once the Statute of Secrecy has been breached.

In [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Motivations/Motivations/][Motivations]], by Jeconais, Harry does a sleight-of-hand infusion of magic to allow a squib to make a potion. He also does a direct (and obvious) infusion of magic to activate a runic scheme drawn by a squib.
