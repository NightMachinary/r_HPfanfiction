I can't remember the exact details but what I do remember are;

1. Harry is the older brother of BWL.
2. He plays chaser.
3. He plays for the England team against Krum.
4. He is friendly with Cedric. (and 2 other guys I don't remember.)
5. He has a younger sister.

I'll be really grateful if someone can find me this fic.


** Harry Potter and The Veela is an attempt at linkffn(Knowledge is Power by Nkari217)

I really don't know why I like this fic so much. Objectively, it's poorly written. Harry is a Gary Stu and so many portions are so over the top. Yet, I love reading this over and over again.
