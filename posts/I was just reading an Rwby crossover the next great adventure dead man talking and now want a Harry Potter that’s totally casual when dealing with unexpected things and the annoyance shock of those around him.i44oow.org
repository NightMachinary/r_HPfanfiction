“ Yes, Ozpin?"

"Glynda, my office is glowing."

"It's what?"

"Glowing."

"Why is your office glowing, Ozpin."

"I don't know."

** A Doctor Who crossover where The doctor visit Harry from time to time starting well before Hogwarts. The Post-Hogwarts part is pretty much like this with Harry taking care of Alien stuff leaking in the magical world.

** What's the update rate like on this story?

RWBY is one of those things I would really like to explore through fanfiction, since most of the fandom is constantly trying to tell me the show is awesome in premise, but hot garbage in execution (like many show fandoms, now that I think about it).

*** Honestly, I am only into rwby as much as I am because of fan content. The show itself is okay, but I feel they miss a lot of opportunities with their characters and plot. I think fanfics explore the world and characters a lot better. So its just a process of slowly going through and finding stuff you enjoy and taking the time to read them.

Sadly to say, a lot of Harry Potter/RWBY fanfictions are slow to update or dead, at least the ones I followed are.

If you want, I can point you towards some interesting RWBY fanfictions. Just PM if you want.
