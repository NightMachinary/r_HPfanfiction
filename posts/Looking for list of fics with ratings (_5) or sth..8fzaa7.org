By rating I mean something like IMDB.

[[https://ff.net/][FF.net]] has pseudo rating with Favs number, but it means nothing without dislike option. Favs = 100 could mean that out of 500 people 20% liked it enough to put in Favs, or it was read by 10k people and only 1% put it in Favs.

Some years ago [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/pages/library-list/]] had ratings attatched to the stories, but now it doesn't.


** it still has ratings.
