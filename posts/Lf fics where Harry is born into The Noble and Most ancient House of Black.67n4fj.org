As the title suggest, fics where Harry is a Black (Preferably the heir) and everyone knows he is one. Basically, life through Hogwarts identifying as Harry Black instead of Harry Potter with the prestigious Black name behind him.

Second request: Looking for fics where there is a female Black Harry's age and he is friends with her instead of his usually tag along crusade.

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)

  The House of Black still stands. The House of Black will always stand. But what happened after Hallowe'en 1981? Dynastic feuds, family politics and maybe, just maybe, a hope which can be found in the dark of night, and the darkest of hearts. Not your typical Sirius-has-a-daughter story. Rated M. Complete.
