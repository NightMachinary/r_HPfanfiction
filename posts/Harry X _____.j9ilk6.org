I'm looking for books where harry becomes pregnant with a "dark" side child (through magic or sex) and he goes to the father of the child.\\
My favorite so far is Second Chance so if you have any like that it would be awesome. I would prefer if it was lucius or Tom/Voldemort BUT I will read anything

** “The Unknown Light by someryn” linkao3(6242449) ... OK, I don't like slash, so it is not Harry who is pregnant, but the concept is the same.

** If you would prefer Tom/Voldemort, or Lucius, or any slash, you should probably try [[/r/hpslashfic][r/hpslashfic]], you might get more of a result over there. Most people over here don't read slash, and you're not gonna get much response unless you're willing to read Harry/Daphne, or Harry/Fleur.

  He had never expected this to happen. In actual fact, he didn't know what was going to happen, but this had never crossed his mind. But fate did so like to play with her favourite person! When Sirius died, Harry went of the rails, he got himself involved with with the enemy and now he has to face the consequences. But maybe, in the end, it's not as bad as it seems!MPREG TMR/HP
