Hi folks,

About 4 years ago I read a HP fanfiction story that I honestly don't remember that well...it was a long story, I remember that, probably upwards of 30 chapters, and it involved Harry travelling around trying to solve some sort of mystery. At the end the gang found themselves in some kind of big horrible cave where there were crystals of some kind that were dangerous, I think? I believe it was set post-Hogwarts, but I could be wrong about that. I know this description sounds totally stupid but it was such a good one and I'd love to read it again!


** Sounds a bit like Mrs_Grangers [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=245803][The Summer After the War]] and its sequel [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=260207][The Winters After the War]].

*** Both of those are absolutely fantastic and if you haven't read them you should.
