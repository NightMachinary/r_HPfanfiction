Harry walks into the forbidden forest and see Voldemort sitting on a stone looking at him.

“Hi Harry, did I ever tell you, the definition of insanity?” Voldemort stares at him, not blinking.

Harry looks his surrounding and see Hagrid getting kicked over by a bunch of death eaters.

“Insanity is, doing the exact same fucking thing, over and over again, expecting shit to change. That, is, crazy. The first time, it was your dad told me that, I dunno, I thought he was bullshitting me, so, boom, I shot a killing curse at him. The thing is, he was right. And then I started seeing, everywhere I looked, everywhere I looked, all these fucking wizards, doing the exact same fucking thing... over and over and over and over again thinking 'this time is gonna be different' no, no, no please... This time is gonna be different, I'm sorry, I don't like... The way... you are looking at me!” Voldemort shots a reducto curse at the stone under him and it explodes.

“Okay, Do you have a fucking problem in your head, do you think I am bullshitting you, do you think I am lying? Fuck you! Okay? Fuck you!... It's okay, Harry, I'm gonna chill. I'm gonna chill... The thing is... Alright, the thing is I killed you once already... and it's not like I am fucking crazy. It's okay... It's like water under the bridge.” Voldemort starts pacing around and took out his wand, pointing at Harry's head.

“Did I ever tell you, the definition of insanity?” A green light shots at Harry and his world turns black.


** "Hagrid never told you what happened to your father."

...Nope, can't do it. Voldemort's pretty much defined by his inability to understand love, I don't think that even a James Potter version of him could tell Harry to 'search his feelings'.

** I've toyed with the idea that during his time between bodies Tom had studied up on True Modern Evil. When revived in the Graveyard, he calls his Death Eaters and starts outlining his plan using PowerPoint and a deck of 15,000 slides.

** Then have Harry respond with completely unfitting "hero" responses, like

"My name is Harry Potter. You killed my father. Prepare to die"

"I'll be back"

etc
