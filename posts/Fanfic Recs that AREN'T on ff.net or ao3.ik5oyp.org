So from being on this subreddit I've come to realize that not all fanfiction is on those two websites ü§£ Recently I've read a good bit of Jeconais as well as Starkindlers EAD stuff and really enjoyed them. I was wondering if anybody knew of any other authors like these who have their work on either a different site or their own website completely? I should probably note that I don't have a preference of what its about; the usual bashing tropes are a guilty pleasure, and I don't care about the ship etc, I mostly just want to widen my scope. Old fanfic, incomplete, anything really as long as its good and (long preferably if incomplete)\\
Thank you!!


** There are several good, if incomplete stories at [[http://home.exetel.com.au/jaina/index.html][Jaina's Junkyard]].

On hpfandom, I liked [[http://hpfandom.net/eff/viewstory.php?sid=43381][Exclusion]], by Maethoriel Raina, [[http://hpfandom.net/eff/viewstory.php?sid=44732][Royal Ward]], by Catstaff, [[http://www.hpfandom.net/eff/viewstory.php?sid=10596][Two Shall Be As One]] by Corwalch.

There's also [[http://imagine.e-fic.com/viewstory.php?sid=497][Play to Your Strengths]], by Lady Foxfire.

On Sunk Into Your Eyes, I like [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=8935][Teatime in the Garden]] by Lady Tonks, and [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=126720][Report on the Excavation of Sites HH-87 and HH-88]] by Rhetor.

I haven't spent much time at Twisting the Hellmouth (Buffy crosses), but I did read and enjoy [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-8583/Greywizard+Prophecies+We+Don+t+Need+No+Stinking+Prophecies.htm][Prophecies? We Don't Need No Stinking Prophecie]]s, by Greywizard.

I've seen recommendations for [[https://hayseed42.wordpress.com/2014/06/27/getting-the-hang-of-thursdays-0122/][Getting the Hang of Thursdays]] and [[http://kimbawest.deviantart.com/art/Mists-of-Avalon-188478452][Mists of Avalon]], but I haven't read either of them yet.
