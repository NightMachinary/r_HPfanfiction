Hey everyone! Also trying to find a fix I read a couple years ago. It's based off an alternate time line in which Voldemort won the first war. His son is kidnapped and supposedly dead. Harry and the rest of the Order live in little camps and fight against Voldy. Harry goes out on one of the raids against them and gets captured in the process. Voldemort decides to â€˜adopt' him because Harry is apparently actually his son (dun dun dun)

I'm pretty sure it's called A Twist in Fate/Time, something like that. It's possible it's been deleted at this point because it's been so long but I figured it couldn't hurt to try

Thanks!
