I want to read stories were magic is told vividly in the story. I don't mean stories filled with info dumps on hard magic, but stories that make you excited about the magical world through the power of descriptive writing.

What I liked about the original Hp stories was how wondrous it made you feel reading about all the magical foods, flying broomsticks, and magical creatures in contrast with the mundanity of the ‚Äúnormal world‚Äù which was the Dursley's.

So I want you guys to recommend me stories that brings back that wonderment back. It can be romantic, whimsical, adventurous it doesn't matter neither do the pairings. It can be gen, slash, het, poly. My only requirement is that it doesn't overdo the hard-magic aspect by going in to too much technicality.


** Knowlege is Useful but Power is Power by Disobediencewriter

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8215565/1/Knowledge-is-Useful-But-Power-is-Power]]

House of Potter Rebuilt by Also Disobediencewriter

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11933512/1/The-House-of-Potter-Rebuilt]]

Both of this are good but "knowldge is useful but power is power" is better in my opinion.(Although the better parts are towards the end.)

** For me this has the most beautiful depiction of magic: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom]])

The magic I am talking about doesn't really start until 4th year and it is abandoned, but honestly it's so long I've never even finished 6th year. Do not mean it is boring but I have a hard time committing to a story for a month, as I am a very slow reader.

** They're not long nor go super elaborately into magic systems but [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/390301][astolat's]] works have some really creative things like a Voice Box (can take someone's voice and keep it in there rendering them mute) and a scarily sentient Grimmauld Place that's out to get you. In particular I'd recommend Timeshare, Reparatio, House Proud, Unseen and Slithering.

  [Book 1 of HP & the Path of Knowledge] A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge and a genuine passion for magic. His new life eventually throws him on a journey for answers - those relating to his mysterious cursed scar, his unknown parentage, and the intricacies of magic itself. Alas, if only it was ever that easy... (AU Pre-Hogwarts)
