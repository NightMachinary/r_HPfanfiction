Sorry for the long title.

So since there's not many Stranger Things and Harry Potter crossovers out there I decided to make one.

The beginning vaguely follows this: Harry Potter decides to leave Britain after the Second Magical War and live in an American Town named Hawkins, located in Indiana. I pushed the Harry Potter timeline back so that it fits the Stranger Things Timeline. Eg: when most of the Characters were born.


** So many downvotes? Wow. People are jerks.

In any case, I hope it goes well. I have yet to read any /Stranger Things///Harry Potter/ crossovers, but I look forward to seeing it.
