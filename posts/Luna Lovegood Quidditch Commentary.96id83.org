I'd really love to read any fanfic on how she landed the gig. If there's one part of the whole series that had me dying laughing, it was her commentary. I'd love to see the exchange between her and Mcgonagall where she was appointed.


** Never heard of a story like that, but I remember one that had a funny twist on her commentary (Harry and Luna are dating):

  In HBP, Luna did commentary for the Gryffindor/Hufflepuff Quidditch match. But what if she had done it as the girlfriend of Harry Potter?
