:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I've read it a while ago and can't remember the name. There was a scene in first year where in kings cross Molly Weasley tries to get Harry to come with her and he screams '' stranger danger '' attracting a crowd and she gets arrested and later at the feast she barges in abd yells at him.. Not sure if it's a Time Travel fic or not..
