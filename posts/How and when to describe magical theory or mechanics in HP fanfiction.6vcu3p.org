A lot of stories go into great detail about some topic of magical theory.

This can be extremely fun and interesting when done correctly like the potion theory in linkffn(The Next Great Adventure by Taure; The Shadow of Angmar by Steelbadger) or the necromancy in linkffn(Circular Reasoning by Swimdraconian) or the thread magic in linkffn(By the Divining Light by enembee).

Other times, it comes off as rather cumbersome, or even excruciating. kathryn518 and Darth Marrs tread into this category pretty regularly for me.

What is it that determines whether magic is intriguing or tiresome? Specifically how and when should one describe magical theory or mechanics?


** I think it comes down to timing/pacing and how technical it gets. If it's like 5000 words of the author explaining how magic works, that's just boring. If they stop in the middle of a fight to say "oh yeah btw here's how x, ψ, and 參 work" then it's clearly the wrong place and time. I also factor in whether it's universal or just creating an OP-MC. When they're rewriting the entire concept of magic from the fanon/non-HP world stuff and spend pages and pages dithering on about how Harry is the only one that can do X magic or whatever, it gets annoying. But that's more an issue of simply making your MC completely overpower the enemy, effectively eliminating all conflict and interest from the story.

You really have to consider how much it is actually going to affect the story that you think you're treating magic as a whole differently than the commonly accepted fanon interpretation. Are you completely rewriting everything and not using anything like wands, spells, runes, cores, and potions? Do you need to do that at all, and if you do, do you even really need to explain it more than just a passing sentence? I know we like to joke about magical cores but honestly it's a decent system that just works for most situations: Skill, Energy, and Will --- Mind, Body, and Soul. While circumstances of birth might grant the character aptitude in one of those three (Hermione, Ron, and Harry respectively, for a somewhat canon example), all three are equally necessary for proper utilization. The Power Trio / Five Man Band is so fundamental to story telling that to go without dramatically reduces the quality of the story. Additionally, if you do give your MC a specialty, let them grow into it. I liked Rune Stone Path, but I did not like how Harry /started/ as a literal runes god. Most bad stories are like that. The Rule of Three is important here too in my opinion: Fail Fail Win. Five also works: Win Win Fail Fail Win or Minor success - overconfidence - major setback - regroup - triumph. Either way, demonstrating that your characters have put in the effort, pushed past the failures, and earned their success is key, regardless of how the magic works to get them there. I know I'm getting into writing theory rather than magical theory, but it sort of falls under the topic

If you do decide that your magical world's magic absolutely needs to be explained then I think the best time and place would be early on during a study session, and have it be written as part of dialogue rather than a montage of MC learned to do /this/ because he had an epiphany that magic works like /that/ and he's the only one that can do it. Just telling the readers how it is doesn't make it intriguing. Having your characters just know it isn't either. Give them trials to overcome, have them fail, let the bad guys be better at something.

Sorry I'm kinda rambling, but I thought I'd throw it all out here at once instead of flooding the IRC lol

** Read Jim Butcher's Dresden Files series or Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn series.

In Mistborn, it's not really a mystic and unpredictable power we are talking about instead it's actually quite scientific power. You consume X and perform Y. And there are some combos you can perform. It's quite gamey actually. Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn series sometimes uses master-apprentice study sessions to give us in-depth magical theory and sometimes gives us not-so-in-depth magical theory during events subtly and we subconsciously learn at least what would happen if X is performed. We, readers, don't have to know the exact math and formulas behind every single spell. To make the story much more immersive, it's good for the author to actually know those stuff but the reader doesn't have to know everything. Only tell when the reader absolutely needs to know. Or when it's actually fun. For example in Mistborn sometimes our character fails and her teacher makes fun of it while telling her why she failed. While we are laughing at that scene, we also learn some magical theory without any effort.

On the other hand, Jim Butcher's Dresden Files has 'magic' magic. It's named magic, the book's main character is also named Harry. Anyway; compared to Harry Potter's magic, it's a bit more will-based and ritualistic. There are no universal magic words -mostly- that you need to know to in order to be able to cast a spell for example, you find a word for your spell to make it easier to focus on it to cast etc etc etc. Through the whole series, our main character explores magic, performs it a lot and I'm sure in every single book there is a new type of magic explained. (He even reanimates a dead Dinosaur with necromancy and then rides it.) Books are written in first person perspective so we always hear the main character's inner thoughts and there are a lot of fun stuff going on in his head while he is performing magic. And our character doesn't really know every magical stuff, so we learn with the character and not immediately. And we only learn what we need to know when we are seeing the character performs it. Even the exploration of magic become interesting that way. Especially with a little bit suspense. He wonders why it happened that way, starts researching, stumbles upon some information which leads to another one... Magical theory part turns into a journey. And sometimes the author tells us he learned something but only mentions it without really telling the us what he learned. Then we see Harry perform that magic and during that, we also learn why he did what. Some nice little suspense mystery. Close to the climax of the story the author also reveals some magic theory that readers didn't know until that moment. So it makes the climax much more interesting to read because everything starts to make sense. Some bizarre thing our character did earlier was actually part of a big ritual and it was important because of some other stuff we knew etc etc. So we say 'Yes, it makes perfect sense, I understand that!' Also that book has a spirit thing with centuries of experience and it gives Harry hints at what to do in certain situations. And that spirit is mean, lewd and witty. It's quite fun to read those parts because that spirit sometimes tells us what creative inappropriate stuff we can do with that spell. So again, author gives us the theory while telling us possible situations to use it and some of those situations are funny. As a result we don't feel like reading a boring very serious essay about how to perform magic.

Brandon Sanderson has some lessons in YouTube and in one of them he talks about world building (including magic system if there is any) and draws an iceberg. He tells that the author should show only the tip of the iceberg in detail while hinting that it continues at the bottom. The reader doesn't need to know every single detail about the world. But author should know, at least more than the tip, so it doesn't cause some plot holes afterwards.

*** Dresden Files is an amazing series. Definitely one of my favorites. I wish there were more good Harry Potter & Dresden File crossovers to read.

** The question you shouldn't ask is "how" or "when." The question you should ask is "Why."

Are you wanting to go into technical details to show off how clever the character is? How clever the author is? Are they trying to set up a clever moment in the future where a character uses the mechanics of multiple bits of magic in novel or unexpected ways?

In my opinion, it gets tedious when the author forgot to ask "why."

** I like the theory described when it's something new, especially odd, or intricate (such as rituals), and then only in short bits. Diving into the theory behind the magic is a tricky business, because it is easy to lose readers' attentions if you go too deep but at the same time easy to leave them confused about the magic if you don't go deep enough. The trick is to see if it's important to the plot. If it is, the explanation and mechanics should go fairly in depth to ensure understanding. If it isn't, a sentence or two about what that specific magic does is normally enough to get the message across.

** Taure, Steelbadger and enembee (at least in the Valbonë) have magic that is different from the rules of our world, and thus interesting. This is especially visible in Steelbadger's and Taure's fics where they push heavily on the concept-based nature of magic. This underlying idea that magic is based on ideas is very elastic and allows for the creation of many rules that are unpredictable, but internally logical at the same time (see also Discworld for rules like that being applied to the whole working of the world).

** To my mind, there's no point into going into the how and why magic works unless it serves the story, otherwise it's a distraction. If you want to get into a deep dive on magic theory, write an essay on it, don't try and shoehorn it into a fic.

I have a couple of examples from my fic, California Dreamin'. In my Potterverse, Aurors have the trick of being able to Apparate silently rather than with the more common /crack/ that's described in the books. Ginny wants to learn and she manages to get Harry to teach her. This required me to come up with a theory and mechanism for such a thing to occur and it was pretty fun working with my beta reader to come up with what I eventually did.

Another aspect of the magic in Harry Potter that I find interesting is wandless magic. There are some things that /might/ be able to be done wandlessly such as Apparating and other things that normally aren't and apparently being able to do things without a wand is the mark of a strong magician. In the story, Harry has to wandlessly manipulate an item made of gold and it got me to thinking--how easy or difficult is it for a wizard to affect things outside of themselves without the focusing conduit of a wand? What if the thing that needed to be affected was made of a really elementally stable material such as gold?

Both of these afforded me to explore how I thought magic would work in the Wizarding world in the context of events in the story and I always enjoy reading how other authors interpret the workings and theories behind magic. I'll have to check out the stories you mention in your post. :D

** I personally love all such explorations. For me, they don't need to be especially related to the plot, as long as they're well written and in character --- which means that if it's Dumbledore and/or Flamel and/or Hermione (etc.) discussing magical theory, it makes perfect sense, but I'd rather not have Harry and Hermione start blabbering about it out of the blue since it probably wouldn't be a normal conversation topic for them.
