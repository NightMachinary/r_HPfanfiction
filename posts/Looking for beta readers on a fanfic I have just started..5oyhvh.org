Good day, everyone.

I have just started a fanfic I've been aiming to write for quite some time but never could get an acceptable beginning for. It's still in its early stages - I haven't yet reached chapter 3 - but I would like some feedback. It starts on Year One and hopefully goes through all the way but it's way too early to speculate on that. The main gist of it is that Harry flees the Dursleys at age five and is taken by a professional criminal of international background. I know I'm not saying almost anything about it; the thing is, I plan for the beginning to be unclear on Harry's backstory and for more information to be given through flashbacks and interludes and such. I'd be delighted to answer any questions on it.

Thank you for your time.
