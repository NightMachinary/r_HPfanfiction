I'd prefer it to start with everybody's deaths.

Linkffn(When a Veela Cries) is a good example.

***** Cool, thanks. Is this Harry/Rose? I'll read if it is or isn't, but I'm curious.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

** Circular Reasoning is one of my all-time favorite fics linkffn(Circular Reasoning by Swimdraconian). Harry begins in a war-torn, post-apocolyptic-type world where everyone he has loved is dead. He gets thrown back to age thirteen? and struggles to shape a better future. Very dark, violent, and heart-wrenching.

Fair warning: it was abandoned for a couple years and is unfinished. However, it was updated in May and the author is still active on DLP, so I expect an update soon. Regardless of its incomplete status, it's truly a must read. I can't recommend it highly enough.

  Torn from a desolate future, Harry awakens in his teenage body with a hefty debt on his soul. Entangled in his lies and unable to trust even his own fraying sanity, he struggles to stay ahead of his enemies. Desperation is the new anthem of violence.
