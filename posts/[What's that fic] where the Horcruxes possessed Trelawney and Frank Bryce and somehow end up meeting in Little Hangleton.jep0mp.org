I don't remember if any others were possessed but I do remember those two. Trewlaney got possessed by the Diadem while Frank got possessed by the ring. Not sure if there was a Harrymort, Ginnymort and Quirrelmort - but that would have been awesome. A Kreachermort would have made it better.


** It might be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6035532/1/Souls-Abound][Souls Abound]] by RobSt. I'm pretty sure that each Horcrux decides to possess the nearest living being it can get its hands on.

*** You know, I wasn't expecting it to be a Robst story but after skimming through this one, I remembered that I had indeed read it before. It's funny that the parts I remembered were the Horcrux ones rather than the main story itself.
