The amount of “friendless Harry” fics I've seen which completely by passes the whole point of the fic is unreal, Harry and Draco are complete polar opposites ffs


** I remember a fic with a brooding and depressive Harry that starts in fourth or sixth year where he's a total loner (until he meets Hermione and/or Daphne) but I don't remember the name.

I think this is one of those stories which definitely captures the loner vibes. Still reading it tho.

  How different would Harry Potter's first year of school have been if the Dursleys had successfully suppressed Harry's natural curiosity? This NARRATIVE shows what could have been.

** linkao3(24931486) hopefully that works, never done that before

Harry is basically cursed to not be noticed and that's how he likes things, the curse wears off like halfway through and he has to overcome his fear of people

  Harry isn't the Boy-Who-Lived, but his parents still died, and Albus Dumbledore, concerned that Death Eaters might seek the boy's death, cast a powerful charm on him to make wizards ignore him before Harry was left with the Dursleys. Except, with the Elder Wand in play, the charm was far too powerful, and made others essentially forget Harry existed when not directly interacting with him. Sorted into Ravenclaw at Hogwarts, Harry lives a contented life with no one either loving or hating him...until the charm breaks on his seventeenth birthday, and he's suddenly plunged directly into the middle of a living world at war.
