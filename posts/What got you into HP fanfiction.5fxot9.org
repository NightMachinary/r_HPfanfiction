Personally, I actually was searching stuff about Rick Riordan, when I came across PJ fanfiction. After reading that for a fair bit of time, I started branching out into other fandoms- namely, HP.


** It was actually Alan Rickman's death. I watched a few tribute fanvids on YouTube, got super depressed about how Severus had such a shitty life, then had the thought that someone /must/ have written him a happy ending lol. I had read other fanfics in the past, (mostly from the Tunnel Tales, based on the 80's Beauty and the Beast TV show, because the last season was horrible and the fanfic endings are so much better), but I'd never really gotten into it. So I started off with re-do fics with SSLE pairings. I think the first one I ever read was His Greatest Wish (or one with a similar premise). Now, almost a year later, I'm reading HPLV slash fics.... Not sure how that happened lmao!!

** Depression plus escapist tendencies. I think I stuck with it and have read so much because I heavily identify with Harry.

Still not sure if I should look at this hobby as something that I should try to drop, since I've read an unhealthy amount of fanfiction in the past year. I want to start writing some myself so that it will help me develop as a writer and then hobby could be more justified.

We'll see.

***** I actually find it /more/ difficult to write fanfiction, funnily enough. Since many potential readers already have their own expectations going in (ones that often conflict), it makes it a bit of a challenge to appeal to canon in any form or fashion without rehashing.

I might just be overthinking it, though. It's nice to read stuff that I already half know from the onset. Good stuff.

** A friend of mine, sent me a fan fiction for an anime, I tight it was pretty good and noticed that HP had the highest amount of fics so I explored. I stopped reading for a while but then I got into an again by getting into an argument with someone about a fic and then going back and rereading it.

** I was in a pretty dark place. My daughter had gone to live in Australia and I started to reread the books probably because HP was a thing we used to do together. When I was reading OotP I got really wrapped up in the house at Grimmauld Place and Sirius's story and I hated that JKR hadn't done anything with Sirius except kill him off. So I started looking for interesting Sirius fics, couldn't really find any I liked, so I wrote my own.

** It was toward the end of my Anime phase, and I had just finished all the english subtititled episodes and movies of Detective Conan. (450+ hours back then, 20'ish movies and 704 episodes) And was scouring the wiki for something, anything. And then I found a list titled 'related works' and clicked the only English named link there called [[http://www.fanfiction.net/anime/Detective-Conan-Case-Closed/][www.fanfiction.net/anime/Detective-Conan-Case-Closed/]]. That is how I found fanfiction, and I quickly went over and began reading HPfanfiction because 90% of all Conan fanfiction was angst and slash.

** I have been reading fanfiction in various fandoms since 1994. (Yes, I am significantly older than most people here). I was thoroughly enjoying an author in the SG:A fandom, had read all of her stuff there, and finally decided to read her HP stuff just to get more of her writing. That opened the floodgates. I've been reading 80% HP stuff for 2 years.

** I had been reading fanfiction for years, before I'd even known what it was called. Star Wars RPF was my guilty pleasure as a 13 year old with a borrowed laptop and a summer to myself. (Wow, that sounds dirty)

But when I finished the last book of HP, a story that I'd lived and grown with over many years, I was very lost. I was first given HP1 by a passerby in a coffee shop, who had found it in a boutique bookstore before the craze and told me the story of a boy wizard (then, I was maybe in 3rd grade). She promised that if she ever saw me again, after she'd finished it, she'd give it to me. A few months later, we crossed paths at that same coffee shop, and it was in her bag with a note on the inside the cover for me.

We were falling on hard times - most everyone in my family died, one after another. A close uncle was murdered, another close uncle died after 9 heart attacks, and Dad died all within a few months around the holidays. We went from a middle class family in Detroit, with plans and opportunities, to selling everything we had. By summer, Mama and I were living out of our car with a few boxes, and my two school uniforms. And of course, my HP book, which I read and re-read, and dreamed of being taken away. I too had an abusive and lonely childhood, so it fit.

I grew up, were were homeless for a while, my mother sinking into pretty crippling depression. This changed my life drastically - there was no more hope. But I'd get kind words from strangers that life would get better. And every time a new book was released, I had saved up change enough to get it and escape into Harry's story again.

By the time the last book came out, my life was completely different. Mama was still depressed and her other illnesses were worsening, but I was no longer alone. I was getting married (very young), I had my own apartment and had graduated high school. I could afford my own life, and had plans for myself.

I was very nervous about HP fanfiction. I didn't want to taint this story with others, or let myself move on from my past. I dabbled in a few one shots, but really couldn't allow myself to enjoy it. I just went back to my hardcovers. Harry Potter got me through a long life, so when I finished HP7 in the middle of the night, I just cried. I didn't know what to do with myself.

I tried to read fanfiction again, but I couldn't read Harry at all. If he was a main character, or even floating around with Ginny somewhere, I couldn't do it. Because of this, I fell in love with Draco / Hermione fiction.

I devoted myself to it, to getting into the "fold" of popular Livejournal writers and betas, then Bunney, ilke, SoftObsidian74, dynonugget, AkashatheKitty, etc... I started a review blog and probably read and reviewed every complete novel-length fic available. One of those writers is now a dear friend of mine in real life.

Fanfiction became my own escape, and eventually I started to branch out into other pairings and fic types. I really just never wanted Harry Potter's world to end, and after all these years, it never has. There is no story that can't be told within the world of HP!

** Well, I got into it the old school way. After I finished GoF around 2001, I was sort of starting to get withdrawal symptoms from lack of Harry Potter. After minutes of brilliant deduction, I decided to search Kazaa for the Order of The Pheonix book. Lo and behold it was there!

Of course it actually was Harry Potter and the Psychic Serpent by Barb in pdf form, but I loved it none the less. I discovered fanfiction.net after a few weeks... The fanfic bug was planted and took roots right there.

I remember reading the bit that had been published and then started looking around, subsequently finding this story set following the Battle, with Harry, Ron and Hermione going back to Hogwarts, Harry, Ron, Ginny and (I think) Hermione being assigned as Aurors, with a mission involving Draco being on the bad side.

** I had just started college and had avoided reading all the HP books for years because everyone kept telling me how much I'd love them, and then somehow stumbled across an HP fanfic online. I have no idea why, but I started reading, loved it, got hooked, and read exclusively HP fanfic for the next two years. Finally let go of my stubbornness and read the books towards the end of college; book 7 came out the summer I graduated. It was an odd progression, because I've read so much fanfic that it seems more canon than the actual canon sometimes. I also learned about the characters first through fanfic, so it doesn't always match up with how Rowling wrote them. It's interesting!

While it by no means fixed our relationship during those years, it did provide us with some common ground.

** I remember it was in 2013, when I was still in high school, and I had not actively thought about HP for quite some time. For some reason I started looking for corny HP jokes, and before I know it I'm reading one of Dimcairien's Books From the Future (I believe it was HBP just before it was taken down). I remember that I liked the Harry/Ginny relationship when I was initially reading the series, so this pretty much became my OTP after like one week of entering the fandom.

However, the first real H/G fic I read was so bad, I'm almost ashamed that I thought it was good at the time (it's Aspirations by megamatt09). I'm definitely glad I moved onto better authors like sbmcneil, pottermum, Brennus, little0bird, MyGinevra and others. Otherwise I could have ended up hating H/G, lol.

** It all started because of the film /Coraline/. I was in third grade at the time.

It honestly wasn't a very good movie, but it traumatized me for about a year, and, until fourth grade, I was too scared to read the book.

But I read the book, and it was a good book, not the best book I had ever read, but it was good in any case. Over the summer, I started looking around online for a legitimate sequel, thinking Neil Gaiman had surely hidden one somewhere. After wading through miles of badly-written /Coraline/ fanfic on admittedly very sketchy sites, I discovered FFNet a bit into my fifth grade year during my break period on a school computer and read some of the /Coraline/ fanfic on there, and some of it wasn't bad. But most of it was complete shit. Around this time, I discovered (and begged my parents to buy) the popular indie video game /Minecraft/, so I persuaded (read: begged [gods, sometimes I want to punch fifth grade me in the face] my parents to buy me that, and immediately started looking for fanfic of it. I found one and read it religiously. I even raved about it to my friends.

I can still remember the time I looked up "Harry Potter fanfic" for the first time. I was in sixth grade at the time, and, naturally, being 12 years old, I didn't know how to find anything except graphic slash.

I didn't know anything about homosexuality at the time, so I was a bit weirded out when Harry fell in love with Voldemort, but, for some strange reason that I have never been able to discern, it didn't disturb me enough to quit my web browser and never return, however, so I pushed on, all the time oblivious to this wonderful subreddit.

In seventh grade, I took a brief hiatus from Fanfiction.

In eighth grade, I returned, and I was introduced to the absolutely wonderful world of cliches and tropes. My first Robst fic was linkffn(In This World and The Next), and it made me feel so ill that I had to leave school for the day. After wading through bad cliche Fanfiction. (and discovering linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) ) I discovered [[/r/hpfanfiction]].

At this point, I didn't have a Reddit account yet, this was the first subreddit I ever stumbled across and I was interested in viewing more.

At a chemistry camp for the blind (I'm visually impaired) I discovered linkffn(The Arithmancer).

In the beginning of my ninth grade year, while dancing with my friend at the annual Back to School Dance, (Which, in hindsight, I really don't know why I went to) she told me about the author MarauderLover7, which led me to linkffn(Innocent), linkffn(Initiate) and linkffn(Identity).

In the middle of the year, I created a Reddit account, and I discovered how truly wonderful this community can be.

In the middle of my tenth grade year, I found a thread on [[/r/hpfanfiction]] which asked how you got into HP Fanfiction. I decided to share my story.

Harry Potter Fanfiction has changed my life for the better in many ways, and I will never regret that one summer morning in fourth grade when I decided to look for a legitimate sequel to the book Coraline on my fathers iPad.

** Honestly it was something stupidly simple and yet it took me years to take the plunge. Quite simply... there were 2 series of books where I hated the endings (related to the pairings). In the Harry Potter series, I always wanted Harry/Hermione and hated the idea of Hermione/Ron and Harry/Ginny. In the Eragon series, I wanted more from Arya/Eragon.

So... after many years of being annoyed by it, several years ago I finally took the plunge of looking for stories that went the way I had hoped. It was shortly after I started using reddit and discovered all the amazing communities out there such as this one. Next thing I know... I am hooked and reading story after story.

I particularly love seeing and looking at a cannon world I know and enjoy, and discovering how many unique and interesting concepts and ideas people can come up with and develop into amazing stories.

*** Oh my god, it never even occurred to me I could search for Arya/Eragon. Looks like I'm set on fanfiction for a bit.

**** Sadly there is not a ton of it. Eragon in general seems pretty under represented in Fan Fiction.

Here are most of the the ones recommended to me (that are not 1 shots or heavy smut... i think), when I first posted on another board looking for fan fiction with the focus on Arya/Eragon. I have not read them all myself yet as I got heavily side tracked by the world of Harry Potter fan fiction.
