** The shipping wars of the HP fandom started around the time /Goblet of Fire/ was released in July 2000. The main phase was between June 2003 and July 2005, between the releases of /Order of the Phoenix/ and /Half-Blood Prince/, as the fandom was (rightly) considering that /Half-Blood Prince/ would end up being the deciding book for the pairings. The main shipping wars by far were between the Harry/Ginny-Ron/Hermione, otherwise known as "One Big Happy Weasley Family", and HMS Harmony (Harry/Hermione). H/G did become canon, but the shipping wars continued until the release of /Deathly Hallows/ in 2007, and probably for some time thereafter too. The main "battlegrounds" were on the HP4GU yahoo groups, CosForums.com, FictionAlley.org, and various Livejournal.com blogs. There are still some shipping wars today, but what could be described as being "great power conflict" back then has devolved into "small scale insurgencies" against the canon by various non-canon ships, so probably nowhere near the scale it was fifteen years ago.

I'm just putting this out there for anyone who actually doesn't genuinely know, because I suspect that this is from another batch of troll accounts: [[/u/Wyattbrother]], [[/u/adarsh58]], [[/u/Theslewfoot]], and [[/u/mildymort]] potentially. They are deliberately starting these threads to try and be inflammatory and start some controversy. Furthermore all of these accounts have been created on the same day. Apart from this one, there are already other threads being started at the same time here. Some of the threads that were started by these accounts seem similar to the ones here a few months ago, but this time on [[/r/harrypotter]]:

Here are the accounts that were used here back in February: [[/u/fanafana]], [[/u/Pogbaisshit]], [[/u/wengerisacunt]], [[/u/worydfandomer]], [[/u/Klopptheclown]], [[/u/Seenu1]], [[/u/gzgGahavaavaava]], [[/u/varunf]], and [[/u/praveen4]]. So I don't think it's that much of a stretch to think that this is all by the same person, even the latest batch.

ETA: Once you get started, this will probably take a while.
