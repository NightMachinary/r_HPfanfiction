Ever fandom has it. That moment as you read when the hair on your arms raises up, when your whole body tingled in preparation for what is about to occur.

It can be a conversation, a cliffhanger, a fight, an entrance. Literally any moment of a story can be badass.

My only rules are, you must link the fiction, and you must support why its badass. What makes this moment, more badass than say reading randomficinserthere.


** Harry versus the Droid Army in linkffn(I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For)

With a single spell, Harry /obliterates/ the largest invasion force seen during the Clone Wars. During the spell, Harry is described as a conductor of the chaos that he unleashed.

And the aftershocks of the spell change the very nature of the Force.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

** This is the most memorable scene I have ever came across. Ever. Period. I was just in awe how the author can make me imagine that scene with such detail and made me scream: “Sirius Orion Black is so badass!” Basically, it's how the author reimagined JK Rowling's motorbike chase scene with Sirius escaping from the Death Eaters. However, this story is from Regulus' POV after he changed his his alliance from Voldemort so he is trying to protect Sirius.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8895954/4/Harry-Potter-and-the-Deus-Ex-Machina][Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina]] by Karmic Acumen (Chapter 3: The Great Black Hunter) - Regulus POV

linkffn(8895954) Status: Complete

#+begin_quote
  Then he gasped and clumsily turned when Sirius made another one of those reality-defying swerves and entered a side-alley that finished in a dead end. Cursing under his breath, he was about to mutter something about Sirius apparently not knowing muggle London as well as he seemed to when he got first first real reason to panic.

  His brother wasn't slowing down.

  It was like watching a train wreck. Horrifying, mind-numbingly shocking and yet somehow impossible to tear your eyes [a]way from it. Sirius drove forward, accelerated to the maximum and then hit the breaks, leaning backwards and pulling the front of the bike along, looking every bit as though he was going to start riding up the wall.

  With a cracking blast of raw magic, the motorbike left the pavement. Sirius pushed the accelerator all the way through, just as his bike slammed into the wall wheels-first...

  ...and then proceeded to ride up the wall as if it had always been meant to do that.

  The roar of the engine got cleared the higher the bike came, like a dragon rising from the depths of a volcanic lair. The bike picked up speed with every meter it ascended and then the 20-story building suddenly came to an end.

  The death eater broomstick pursuit squad broke ranks when Sirius shot up from below like a cannonball, right into their midst. One of them lost his hold on his broom and fell with a muffled scream. Regulus didn't pay attention, nor did he care if he would remember to apparate or cast a Arresto Momentum before completing the process of plummeting to his death. More interesting was the sight of Sirius Orion Black righting himself and spinning on his two wheels as though he were on the highway, outlined perfectly against the half-moon. It was like the sky had chosen to be miraculously clear of London's normal pollution on that particular night just so the scene would be possible.

  /Damn/, his brother was cool! The /definition/ of the word.
#+end_quote

I agree with you, Regulus. I definitely agree with you.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

** Harry destroying a Dementor in chapter 45 of linkffn(HPMOR).

#+begin_quote
  Harry thought of the stars, the image that had almost held off the Dementor even without a Patronus. Only this time, Harry added the missing ingredient, he'd never truly seen it but he'd seen the pictures and the video. The Earth, blazing blue and white with reflected sunlight as it hung in space, amid the black void and the brilliant points of light. It belonged there, within that image, because it was what gave everything else its meaning. The Earth was what made the stars significant, made them more than uncontrolled fusion reactions, because it was Earth that would someday colonize the galaxy, and fulfill the promise of the night sky.

  Would they still be plagued by Dementors, the children's children's children, the distant descendants of humankind as they strode from star to star? No. Of course not. The Dementors were only little nuisances, paling into nothingness in the light of that promise; not unkillable, not invincible, not even close. You had to put up with little nuisances, if you were one of the lucky and unlucky few to be born on Earth; on Ancient Earth, as it would be remembered someday. That too was part of what it meant to be alive, if you were one of the tiny handful of sentient beings born into the beginning of all things, before intelligent life had come fully into its power. That the much vaster future depended on what you did here, now, in the earliest days of dawn, when there was still so much darkness to be fought, and temporary nuisances like Dementors.

  Mum and Dad, Hermione's friendship and Draco's journey, Neville and Seamus and Lavender and Dean, the blue sky and brilliant Sun and all bright things, the Earth, the stars, the promise, everything humanity was and everything it would become...

  On the wand, Harry's fingers moved into their starting positions; he was ready, now, to think the right sort of warm and happy thought.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.
