I've been reading a lot of Tri-Wizard fanfics lately and there are SO many different ways people play out the tasks in smarter, funnier, or more interesting ways than the book did. Does anyone else have any Tri-Wizard tasks that were memorable in fanfiction and/or maybe make more sense than in canon? Or maybe even methods you've thought of on your own that would just make all of it so much easier!

Currently I am listening to linkffn(The Green in the Grey by TheBlack'sResurgence) on my text to speech and while I don't find the Tri-Wizard Tournament very interesting in this, it made me think about all the other fics I've read, and how many solutions there are to a tournament that just seems entirely absurd when all is said and done. üòÖ


** I'm pretty sure I've read one where the contestants played 3 rounds of rock-paper-scissors as the "3 tasks" to get Harry out of the tournament. After that, they let the real champions compete on the real tasks.

Another one was where they paired Cedric and Harry up to represent Hogwarts, then chose 1 student each from Durmstrang and Beauxbatons so that every school had a tag team.

Finally there was one where Harry spied on the maze with Omnioculars before the event and observed the maze walls' movement patterns. In the contest proper, his game plan was to walk a bit, wait for the walls to shift, walk again, wall shift and repeat until he got to the center. In that way, he didn't have to fight any of the monsters.

Unfortunately, I cannot remember the titles of these stories.

**** It might be in someone's collection of plot bunnies--and there are lots of authors with those--which is why it's so hard to find.

Or, it could be that I misremembered some parts of [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/8/][The Lie I Lived]]. From the quick skimming that I did, this one had the "choose 2 other contestants" thing but they didn't form tag teams. They also changed the tasks to accommodate 6 contestants.

** This isn't really a 'the contestants being smart', or 'changing up the tasks', thingy, but in one of my favorite fics: 'Nose to the Wind' by Batsutousai, the people in charge of the tournament realise after the second task how absolutely boring it is for the audience to sit and watch at nothing for hours on end, so they come up with tiny floating cameras, or well, magical orbs, that each follow its own contestant around in the maze, and broadcast what they do on big screens for the audience.

This is something I can picture in canon actually, so I think it quite nice.

**** I would imagine, if this had been used in canon, then the part about portkeys needing touch would stop the orbs from following along so that the story could still progress as canon does. Buuut, in this story, SPOILERS; Harry isn't a contestant but in the audience, and Voldemort is the ruler of Great Britain and Irland, and he is the one that came up with the orbs, something he is very proud of.

** I can't remember the name of it but I do know it was written by Clell, the basic was that they fully acknowledged Harry couldn't learn enough magic to compete and so when he got to the first task he was basically crapping his robes terrified and unconsciously slipped into Parseltounge while he talked to himself and the dragon understood him. Instead of some ‚ÄúRahhh free me my chains and you will have my eternal gratitude‚Äù crap though the dragon offered to take a dive in the fight in exchange for a bribe xD. It just got crazier from there, I recommend trying to find it.

** This is actually part of a story idea I've been mulling over for a while, but for the First Task a solution I'm working with is transfiguring rocks/rubble into metal chains, charming them unbreakable, and then using them to tie down the dragon. With a sort-of finishing move where the chain wrapped around it's mouth is further transfigured into a makeshift muzzle to counter the dragon's fire breathing. For the Second Task I'm leaning towards creating an enchanted face mask that can draw oxygen from the water and essentially a pair of [[https://zelda.gamepedia.com/Iron_Boots][Iron Boots]] to allow for walking along the bottom of the lake. For the Third Task I'm undecided, but it'd probably just end up being a brute force effort to get to the Cup before anyone else does.
