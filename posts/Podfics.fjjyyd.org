I've got a Wild IdeaTM. What if you guys recommend fics (or, if you write fanfics, tell me about it), that I can make podfics of?

Obviously I'll ask the authors permission before reading anything, and it won't be right away, because I am ill, but it sounds nice

PS any podfics y'all can recommend?

PPS. I'd like to start with oneshots


** Such a good idea! Keep us all posted

**** No that is the right term.

Could you try to do Harry Potter and the lack of lamb sauce? One of my favourite fan fictions.
