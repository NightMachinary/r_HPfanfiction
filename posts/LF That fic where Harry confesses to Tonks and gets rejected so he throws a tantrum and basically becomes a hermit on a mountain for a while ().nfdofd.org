*** Yes, although tbf as far as I remember Harry in that fic is emotionaly stunted to the point of deep social anxiety with Tonks being basically only person that shows him kindness and is genuinely nice to him. Of course that doesn't justify his responce, but this is 14 year old boy with his first friend/crush so it's not /that/ weird?
