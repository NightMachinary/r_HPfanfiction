Basically the title. I'm looking for some stories where Harry either has a child, adopts one, has to care for one, or starts looking out for a first year, etc. And thus has to grow up and act like a father figure. Anyone know of any good examples of this? (Preferably completed, or close enough that I can make up an ending)

*** Thanks! Grow young with me is actually what got me interested in this idea. That along with stories from other fandoms.

** If you don't mind slash there is a Draco/Harry one where harry ends up looking after Draco's child. It is a lot better than I'm making it sound secrets by vorbiza - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8184311/chapters/18751001]]
