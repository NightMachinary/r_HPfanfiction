Plot points include soul bond, a telepathic link between Harry and Ginny, Ginny going to hogwarts a year early, Sirius and Amelia Bones dating, among other stuff. I'm pretty sure it has a sequel, but I haven't read that far yet.

Thanks in advance


** linkffn(Harry Potter And The Bonds Of Time)

Pretty sure this is what you are looking for.

**** That one is both really good and really bad. The actual smut part is outstandingly good but the "plot" is outstandingly bad. It would have been so much better as "The Hogwarts Sex Club" where everyone just shags around without a law legalising rape (and wasn't it supposed to be a voluntary thing? Why is there so much legal stuff surronding it?)

***** Pretty sure that a law made it legal, and it's not really voluntary because not participating means a huge black mark on your resum√©.

****** I meant the whole part about forcing Harry to participate as a girl. Although it would certainly be fun when it's Malfoy's "turn" and Harry morphs himself a porn level black cock (12+ inches and thick as a telephone pole) on top of his female genitalia and demonstrates why you shouldn't fuck with Harry Potter.
