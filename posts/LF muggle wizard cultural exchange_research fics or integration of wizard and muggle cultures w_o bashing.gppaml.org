Not looking for a muggle or wizard bashing fic. Something good spirited with world building centred around the interactions between wizard and muggle world. The premise I'm looking for is something along the lines of maybe muggle technology improving so much that wizards find it increasingly difficult to live an entirely separate life from muggles. But not one with muggle or wizard bashing - conflicts and tension are fine as long as they are organic. Nevertheless, I would prefer something more - how do I say this - focused on research and world building and establishing an understanding and rapport between two entirely different worlds. Maybe like muggle transfer students or muggle subjects in hogwarts and vice versa and go from there on how both worlds react to these completely alien ways of life.

Edit: Example is WayFarer2000's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9340220/1/Crosswinds-of-Fate][Crosswinds of Fate]] except it is about two different systems of magic. I'm looking for something similar, but with muggle world and technology.
