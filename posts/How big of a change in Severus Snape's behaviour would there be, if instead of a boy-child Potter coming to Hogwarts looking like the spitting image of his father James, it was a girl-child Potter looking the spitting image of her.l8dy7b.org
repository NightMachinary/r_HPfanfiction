#+TITLE: How big of a change in Severus Snape's behaviour would there be, if instead of a boy-child Potter coming to Hogwarts looking like the spitting image of his father James, it was a girl-child Potter looking the spitting image of her mother Lily?

*** Oh god no.

For some reason Snarry is more acceptable than Snape/Female!Harry.

**** I think it's because good Snarry would have to involve significant character growth on both of their parts (and happen in a Snape Lives reality hopefully), whereas Snape/Female!Harry (if she looks like Lily) kind of screams: "Argh! Creepy! No! Bad teacher! No making students into stand-ins for your dead crush!"

I need a moral shower now.

** He'd likely treat her even worse, because in his eyes, she'd be a constant reminder that Lily chose James, not him. His mind would also be hyperfocused on any character trait or tic that reminds him of James, even superficially, and for other random shit.

He might even twist her into a figure of Lily in his mind, and seek to exercise his authority to make her life miserable because of this. Presented with clear evidence of his failure every day, he would slowly shift to resent Lily, and project this onto her daughter.

Snape is not a tragic figure. He's a bitter man who likes bullying children because that's the only amount of power he possesses.

** No significant changes, probably. Snape is very good at seeing only what he wants to see, so even if Potter looks just like lily I'd think snape would convince himself that the girl potter behaves more like her father so that snape can justify being an ass to her, which he wants to do because he's a bitter person.

** If Snape's obsession with Lily is transferred to little Harry, that would be really creepy. I can see that happening, since he's a creepy dude. He'd be careful not to use the M-word this time. I bet he'd be scarily protective of little Harry. I pity anyone who tries to bully her, or date her.

*** That could lead to some interesting consequences down the line, when Snape leans the truth about what needs to happen to ensure Voldemort's final defeat. It could also lead to him never being aloud near girl!Harry without a chaperone.

** I think there would be some change, possibly because he won't have the fight or flight instinct associated with James, but I don't think the majority of his behaviour would change.

He still started teaching when there were students who saw the NEWTS incident happen. He probably learned to teach through fear in order to get obedience through that. The kids younger than me who saw me abused by the older kids don't respect me now as a childcare provider, they certainly wouldn't have respected me a few years after --- and they only got flashed my underwear, my bullies never publicly took them off. Soap in the mouth though? Yeah, old favorite.

He's also got to keep his position with the Slytherins in good standing for the return, and after the bullshit added points in year one from Dumbledore, three days after it happened...

On top of everything you have Dumbledore watching that he doesn't get “too comfortable,” as it were, and he would have made sure that Harriett or whatever her name was, wouldn't be close to Snape. The plan to keep Snape as a spy doesn't work if they're close. Year six and year seven require that distance.

I also don't think he'd want to spend time with the living proof that James's kid lived and Lily didn't. Yes, it's her kid, too, but I think people assume that would make it easier.

** I don't think it would change much. Showing favoritism to Voldemort's greatest enemy in front of a class full of children of his servants wouldn't have helped much his cause as a spy no matter how good you are at Occlumency. Also I don't think there can be worse treatment while remaining within the bounds that the school will tolerate (I had teachers worse than Snape and they got away with a lot of bullying boys and girls alike in an age when mobile phone cameras were not that common) than what Snape already inflicts on Harry.

My personal opinion is that he'd mostly ignore her. He wouldn't feel so compelled to be as cruel with her as he would with the spitting image of James, especially as he'd be regretful about the way he treated Lily. However I don't think he'd be very fair with her either and would still make snide remarks when she fucks up her potion.

** Every single time this concept is written it's some creepy Snape/fem!Harry stuff but in all honestly I think he'd hate her even more because it's James Potter's voice coming out of Lily Potter's mouth.

** He'd probably ignore her as much as possible, because she's a living reminder of his pain and regrets.

Also, the other comments implying he'd creep over a kid are awful. There's literally no evidence of Snape ever misbehaving with any students. I don't know what books ya'll read.
