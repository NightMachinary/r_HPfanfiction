Spooks: Code 7

Crimson swirled into the water and his life flashed before his eyes.

He stood on the tiles of King's Cross, realizing as he clothed himself that King's Cross had no tile floors.

And then she stood before him, wearing the same thing she had worn ever so enticingly on the day she had died. She smiled at him softly, their eleven month old daughter in her arms, her stomach massive with their twins. “You're an idiot, Harry.”

“I missed you, Clarissa.”

“Obviously. You have the stone. Suicide was the worst way to see me again.”

“I don't want to live anymore.”

“Too bad,” she replied, moving forward and kissing him softly before slapping him as hard as she could. “Because you're not dead. Not for a very long time. I'll see you when it's time but before you come home to us one last time, there'll have been six more wives to you.”

“I'm not going to fall in love again.”

She narrowed her eyes. “Harry, who's smarter than you?”

“Not you, pop girl,” he teased. She had left school at eleven due to her telly show and singing career and had only gotten more famous as years accumulated. She had one O-level compared to Harry's four he had received due to Hermione's bullying.

She giggled. “I am, Harry. In death I know more. I know you'll live a very long life. And while anyone else would die from slitting your wrists like that, you'll live.”

She smiled brighter. “It's time for you to go back, Harry. But remember this. My dad was SAS. MI5 needs people like him. And you.”

“You know I can't work with muggles.”

“You're Harry Po---"

⁂

Harry pulled himself out of the pink water, sputtering and coughing up the water he had swallowed. He looked at his wrists. They were mostly healed. Scowling, he raised his hand, summoning a blood replenishing potion. He ignored the bitter flavor as he swallowed it.

⁂

Allison Blakely entered the room, followed by the dark form of Harry Potter.

She nodded at the man chained to the interview chair.

"You can't do this to me!" he snarled.

Harry backhanded the man, smiling as he did so.

"You're a suspect in a major terrorist case. The Britannia Act says I can do whatever the fuck I want to you. To your friends. To your family," she threatened. "And I WILL do whatever it takes for Queen and Country."

Harry listened as she began asking questions. He refused to answer. "I want a solicitor."

"Didn't I just say Brittania Act?" Allison asked, looking at Harry.

He nodded thoughtfully. "Perhaps he's deaf. Maybe some acid in the ears to wash out the wax?"

Seven more unanswered questions and she scowled. "Tell me his name!" She repeated. "Harry, if he doesn't answer me this time, destroy his ankle. He likes to run. We'll take that away from him."

Harry drew his L9A1 and waited.

"Shoot him," Allison ordered.

Harry's well placed shot destroyed the man's cuboid bone. He was left screaming and they moved on to the man's partner in the next room.

~•~

The interrogation for suspect two was just as fruitless until she said, "Do it your way."

Harry grabbed the man's chin, using his free hand to hit the nerve cluster that would force his victim's jaw to open and remain so.

A veritable pharmacopeia was then poured down the muggle's throat.

"I told you I would let him have you," his partner said. "I don't want to see this."

The potions the man ingested went to work as Harry did the same. A knife slit the man's belly open.

The man screamed but only he and his partner next door could hear it. Harry's voice, as soft as it was, overpowered the man's screaming. "To prepare catgut, we begin by removing the intestines. Don't worry, they're growing back as I do this. Such as in the torment of tartarus unable to drink or eat or, perhaps closer, the torture of Prometheus, chained to a mountain with a bird eating his liver, only for them to grow back and the bird to return."

Harry nodded thoughtfully. "The classics really do give a man ideas.

"Then we clean and steep them in water. Luckily for you, I am a wizard. For this would normally take hours and days to do this all and you would die before I finished. Thank god for magic."

He drew his wand and used magic to shape and finish cleaning and preparing the catgut.

Another hour of careful twisting and shaping and a muggle brought in a cello case.

A supersensory charm on the muggle and a perfect silencing charm left him only able to hear his own breathing and heartbeat as Harry prepared his cello, adding the brand new strings to the instrument.

Harry let the man's silencing charm drop then connected the supersensory charm to the cello. A quick addition of ear buds to his own ears and the debut album of Gravediggaz filled his ears as his bow scraped along the strings, filling the air around him with the tortured sounds of Harry scraping the bow along to a rap group, leaving the man once again screaming, pleading for Harry to stop.


** I have to ask: Why are they using torture? It is well-known that torture doesn't work (outside a few edge cases where you can verify the results easily, like getting a password for an encrypted data carrier or such), and since Harry is apparently able to use magic, he could just use Veritaserum.

*** I think that was one of the issues why spooks code nine was so badly received. I figured harry would use x magic but not y, so the muggles don't learn that the mages have certain capabilities.

**** Well, if he really can't use mind control magic, Legilimency or Veritaserum, then I'd expect him to at least use a torture method that's actually working. Shooting a man's ankle with a pistol? What does this do, other than endangering everyone inside the room due to the bullet ricocheting? They didn't even ask him any questions afterwards.

The second victim... that's pretty much torturing someone to death, the work of a sadist, not a professional. Again, it serves nothing but sadism, since they can't count on anything the man said being true, and he'll likely die before they get the truth out of him.

If you want to torture someone for information, you should take care to cause the least physical harm possible, so your victim won't die before you're done.

Harry could have simply used waterboarding, and be done with it, if he really needs to use torture in the first place.

But since he could use passive legilimency and pass it off as being able to read a man's mimic and reactions, or use some weak confundus charm to gain a rapport with a man, there's really no reason to use torture in the first place.

***** The two being tortured are to prep their boss who hears and sees it all due to a modified ludovico technique, the one who actually has the info. I bashed that out last night before crashing, too tired to write it out fully, just wanted to get the first pass done so i remembered what i wanted to so with it.

The sadism is on purpose. If the story ever happened harry would be the next dark lord, turning his coworkers and superiors into his puppets in the muggle government.

****** Well, I can't say much then if the sadism and murder is intended. Though if the scene is meant to showcase how twisted Harry is, then maybe some insight into his emotions - either from outside, a smile or such, or his antipication from his POV - would help.
