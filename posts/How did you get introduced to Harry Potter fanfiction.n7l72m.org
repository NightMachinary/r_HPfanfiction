My story is a bit embarrassing but I stumbled onto fanfiction after seeing frozen 2. I googled is Elsa gay and that lead me to frozen fanfiction. That lead me to HP fanfiction.


** How is that embaressing? Whenever Merlin season 5 was out, oh that season irritated me so I googled "alternative endings" or something along those lines and stumbled onto it then.

** Finished DH and... "now what?". I like how some fics are like "preprocessed food" if you will, no need to remember yet-another-characters name (I'm pretty bad at that) or grasping how the world works. Sure original fic has its own charm, but if you want to go 0 to page-turning-fest in just a few minutes, good fanfics are your best bet.

** Wow, you just made me feel old. I think I got into /Harry Potter/ fanfiction pretty early on, maybe around the time that PoA came out. And by then I was already into /DBZ/ and /Young Jedi Knights/ fanfiction so I visited ff.net fairly often.

** I had a partial quote of a pet rock dying I was convinced I heard before (might've been "I had a pet rock. It died") and I wanted the full quote. It led me to HPMOR, which was my first introduction to fanfics in general.

** I'd always heard that fanfiction is almost always shitty, but some years ago I decided to give it a try. One chapter of /Methods of Rationality/ later, I was convinced they were right and dropped the idea.

Then, about 2 years ago, I came across /Picnic Panic/ by /LeQuin/ and I haven't stopped since. Harry Potter was the first fandom whose fanfiction I explored, but I've now been through Star Wars, Naruto, Stormlight Archive and even Pokemon.

** That's embarrassing? I found it through watching those yt videos that are kinda like fanfic but only ship Harmony, Hinny or Drarry and have a death eater attack/Ginny kidnapping/Harry going to murder death eaters every second episode thingy, they were horrible and basically always unfinished so I searched for better stuff, and found fanfiction, then I started reading and now I'm addicted

Oh and I forgot the ones where the marriage of Harry and Ginny was made to be some international spectacle and Harry's parents and Sirius were resurrected just as a gift for Harry, but of course they can only stay a day/a week because "the rules of the dead prohibit them from staying too long" or some bs

** I was worrying my own fanfic in elementary school. I didn't know it was a thing. Then in 6th grade so like 2006 I found fanlib. I honestly don't know how I stumbled upon it. I found out there were other people doing the same thing as me. It had a wonderful community. I was so sad when it closed in down in 2008. After that I started exploring fanfic.net

If there are any former fanlib people I miss you all!

** The gap between Goblet of Fire and Order of the Phoenix was too long. The Three Year Summer, us old folks call it. We just saw Snape reveal his Dark Mark and get assigned a mysterious mission by Dumbledore, and then we had to waaaaaaaaiiiiit.

I had to know what everyone thought Snape might be doing. And soon I knew I was not alone in that voracious consumption of All Things Snape.

Forums, chatrooms, and the underbelly of Tripod Webrings... It was the wild west, and it very quickly got me into fanfic, as it helped so many of us satisfy our need for more content before JKR delivered.

** Honestly I just got into Naruto fanfiction first, and after reading countless fics I got sick of it. Then I realized that Harry Potter has a metric fuckton of fics as well, and I enjoyed the series, so I got into it

** I was about 10 and Eoin Colfer used to publish the first chapter of his upcoming Artemis Fowl books online, I found Artemis Fowl fanfic, and my mind was blown.

I loved it because my book consumption had been limited to the (very small) school library, discovering I could read /as many books as I wanted/ online was a real game changer.

** I was looking for online books. Original works that I could read for free from an app. I found wattpad. At first I only read original stuff, then I ran across a story about a real singer and I was like , “wait! You can do that?” So I looked into it and found Fan-fiction about creepypasta (I was 12 and really into “horror” stories, ok!?) It only spiraled from there.

** I remember somehow ending up on Fanficnet reading some weird lemon fic about Ginny and Hermione Polyjuicing into Ron and Harry alternatively so that they could "get used to sleeping with them". I ended up not reading any HP fanfic for several years.Actually I even went through a "HP hate" phase, cause I'd watched a couple of edgy anime and now thought HP had "no balls" Eventually 2020 rolled around and gave everyone at least a drop of free time, and I started reading this fic,which is still one of my favorites to date, Recnac Transfaerso

** In 2016, my family was going on a vacation to Universal Studios and I was looking up information. I read a Buzzfeed article and clicked through a bunch of thimgs until I stumbled into a list of HP fanfiction that people had recommended. The rest is history

** Hmm. I love anime and when I first discovered fanfiction I was literally in love with Haikyuu. I was in a multi fandom one shot book when I saw one for Harry. Normally I would just skip over the ones where I wasn't into the fandom but the title intrigued me. I can't even remember what it was but I read it then forgot about it. Fast forward a while and my friends sister insists on watching the Philosophers Stone with us and we were like “why not”. After that I wonder what the HP fandom thinks of it's characters and I decided to check it out

** I'm pretty sure Methods of Rationality was my first, but I can't quite recall how it happened. I think I'd just seen a few references to it and looked it up.

It's a fairly divisive fic, but I liked it. I've long since lost track of what I've read now.

*** Hey, HPMoR was my first HP fanfic too, and was actually what got me into fanfiction in general.

I was introduced to it by the counselor of my country's team for the International Olympiad of Linguistics (which I was on). She called it “both entertaining and educational” or some such, and I decided to read a few chapters to humor her only to get hooked and spend wayy too much of the once-in-a-lifetime experience that was traveling abroad to participate in an international competition glued to my phone reading it.

Since then I have essentially not stopped being glued to a device reading fanfic.

** I'm very much embarrassed by this. I first got into fanfiction in general through a fanfic that my friend was reading. I believe it was a Human!poke on x reader. I didn't make it past the first chapter due to bad grammar. Then I came across black butler x readers which then lead to me finding a Black Butler/Harry Potter crossover. And that's the story of how I got into it.
