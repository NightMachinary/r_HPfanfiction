"Voldemort teach me tricks? ... why, yes actually."

Maybe he sold out the Potters? Maybe he lost it in Azkaban and flipped sides? Don't care. Just want to see a Death Eater Sirius free to use his magic to whatever end.

Bonus points if there's some semblance to canon characterization despite the, you know, /massive/ underlying change.


** Not sure if it's what you want but in linkao3(train to nowhere) Voldemort won when James&Co were still in school. The fic starts with Harry turning eleven. His dad James is a Death Eater, his mother Lily is a housewife (if I remember correctly?). His godfather Sirius is a Death Eater but in the Inner Circle.

If you don't like tomarry in the tags, I've heard that there's still no tomarry there (and it has 400k words!)

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

** Not sure if he's the right hand, but he's a Death Eater for a slightly different Tom Riddle in /there is nothing (to fear)/. It's a series of one-shots and shorts. The series starts with linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15449145]]), but he doesn't come up until part 3.

** By coincidence, I'm recommending this for a second time in a day. linkffn(By the Divining Light by enembee) and linkffn(Conlaodh's Song by enembee) take place in a very AU world where (not much of a spoiler) Sirius really did betray Harry's parents (and really did kill Peter Pettigrew). The story doesn't focus very much on this at all; it's just background. Excellent story, marred a bit by the fact that the third part was never written.
