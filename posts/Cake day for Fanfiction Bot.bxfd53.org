Today marks the 4th year of reddit celebration for our dearest and quirky Fanfiction bot. I'll like to congratulate it and it's creator [[/u/tusing][u/tusing]] for their contribution to our community.

Cheers everyone.\\

*** While I have a closed-source fork it is actually no different from the current open-source version! The bot is stable enough that I haven't had to change any code.

***** tusing's new job doesn't allow open-source contributions of any sort during their employment, IIRC.

******* Imagine a programmer, let's call them J, has been paid to work on a particular problem. J solves the problem and The Company uses that solution to get a big advantage in their sector.

One evening, J comes across an open source project that would benefit from the same solution and adds something similar to it. The Company just lost its advantage.

Now in the real world, that's hardly ever going to happen. But if you're in a sector where innovation is key, you don't want your employees spreading their knowledge around too far.

I was once contracting for one company that tried to change our contracts such that any code I wrote, anywhere, was immediately the company's property. Needless to say, I refused to sign it. Others might not have had that choice though.
