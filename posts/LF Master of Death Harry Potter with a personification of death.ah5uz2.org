I'm looking for MoD Harry fics where Harry is either the personification/god of Death or interacts with the personification/god of Death a lot.

I don't mind crossovers, though most movies/TV shows/books/etc. Harry Potter crossovers are with I've never seen/read, so I would prefer for it to be easy(er) for someone who doesn't have (much) exposure to the other part of the crossover to understand.

One such fic I like is On a Pale Horse, so I'm looking for things like that in particular. I really like dimension/time travel MoD Harry fics or not aging MoD Harry Potter as well, like Full Circle.

Thanks!!!!

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11494031/1/Fair-Lady][Fair Lady]] is a romance between [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_(DC_Comics)][DC Comics' Death]] (the one created by Neil Gaiman in his Sandman graphic novels) and Harry. It's a slow-burn romance, iirc without any explicit smut.

** The /Like a Ghost in My Town/ series by Batsutousai is pretty good. Long, but I was sorry when it ended and wished there was more. If the first book gets a bit grim, the second book is a good tonic. In both books, Harry interacts a lot with Death and isn't shy about using his MOD powers.

  Cursed against his will, Harry made the best of his life until he found himself, again, wandering in Death's realm. When Death offers him a second chance, a chance to right the wrongs he'd been blind to for too long, he can't possibly refuse.

  While Harry had been content with his second chance, that didn't keep him from thinking what he could have done different, how many people could have survived if he hadn't been set on the very specific path he'd walked. Third time is the charm, though, right?

I'm posting on mobile so dont know how to link.

"MoD!Harry is not amused" is crack, crossover with Avengers and gods of various mythologies. I think it's a good read and revisit it every now and then.

  Kuroka had thought she would fail. Her nine lives had been used up trying to save her sister, but it had all been futile. She had resigned to simply escaping, but out of the blue, a random man claiming to be a wizard appears, wielding powers beyond anything anyone had ever seen. With his help, she may just yet be able to save her sister, altering fate. The Master of Death comes.
