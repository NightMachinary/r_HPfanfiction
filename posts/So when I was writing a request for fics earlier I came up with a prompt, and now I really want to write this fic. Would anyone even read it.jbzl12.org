:END:
Sirius and Lily drunkenly hookup during their 6th or 7th year (either before James and Lily start going out or after James and Lily have a fight and decide to ‚Äútake a break‚Äù) because they are sad (Sirius just got into a huge fight with Regulus and Lily just received a letter from Petunia saying her parents died and she missed the funeral) and desperate for some form of comfort and nobody else is around. Afterwards, they both agree it was a mistake and that no one ever needs to know about it because it didn't mean anything and it's never happening again. Soon after, Lily gets (back) together with James and everyone is happy. (Or are they?)

Fast forward three months, and Lily starts getting sick everyday. She's noticed that she put on some weight but since she's always been thin she doesn't really worry about it. Only when Marlene asks when was the last time she had her period does Lily realize: she's pregnant.

But you see, James and Lily haven't been together like that yet, so that means that not only is Lily pregnant, she is pregnant with her boyfriend's best friend's baby.

/Oh, fuck/


** Lily hides her pregnancy from James by transfiguring her belly. On April 1st, 1978, she secretly asks Marlene to be her midwife and give birth. She gives birth to two twins who have the same hair color as her and share Sirius's love for pranks because as soon as they come out of the womb they pee on Marlene and turn her into a frog. Not knowing what to do with the twins and hoping James won't find out, Sirius suggest that they drop them to two of their older peers, Molly and Arthur, who seem to be enjoying the Muggle lifestyle of constantly having sex and getting high. It's likely they won't even remember that they had these babies and they'll be able to offer them a decent life. Molly just finds them in the Burrow and assumes she gave birth to them at some point when she was stoned and she calls them Fred and George.

Then Fred dies, and imagine the entire confusion that will come with Sirius saying "I am your father-"

"You can't be, Sirius."

*** I can't remember the name of it, but this adds interesting headcanon to a story I read in which Sirius offers to adopt the twins into the Black family and make them his heirs.
