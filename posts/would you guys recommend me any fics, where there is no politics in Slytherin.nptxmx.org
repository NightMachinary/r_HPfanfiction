I am tired of reading stories about Slytherin!Harry ruling the whole house. I want fanfictions where the children are children instead of being politicians.


** Do you want fics which focus only on Harry in Slytherin or any fic in which Harry is /also/ a Slytherin? Because I know a few where Harry is a Slytherin, but he isn't the only focus of the story.

Harry goes to Slytherin but there's no politics here. It's just kids messing around and all that stuff. The first few years are fairly light-hearted from what I remember.

  Harry Potter's been away from the wizarding world for nearly ten years. So now that he's back, he's ready to get out there and learn to the best of his abilities. Mysterious bank-package? Not interested. All that matters is getting settled into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry -- the best school in the world.
