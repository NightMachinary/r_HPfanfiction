Fics with good plot and flowerpot shipping. Also, if possible, Multi pairing would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance!!!


** Flowerplot is such a vague shipname. I can't tell if you want Harry/Pansy,Harry/Lavender,Harry/Fleur or Harry/his mother

*** I thought flowerpot refers to Harry/Fleur. But now that you mentioned it, I don't mind the other options as well It'll be interesting to read the rest

**** This sub isn't huge on ship names. Probably best to just say Harry/Fleur in the future.

*** It's one of those names that the creator thought she was being clever with, but forgot to calculate in that all ship names are stupid.

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.
