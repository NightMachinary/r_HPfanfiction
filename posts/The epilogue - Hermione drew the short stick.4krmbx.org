** Well, here we go.

To be honest, the argument that "Hermione deserves better" is not only shitty but also extremely sexist. There. I said it. I'm okay if you ship her with other characters. It's all cool. However, if you try to make the argument that she "deserves better", I'm going to be angry. What you are essentially saying is that Hermione is on a certain tier of awesomeness (which she totally is), but that her partner should be on an equal or higher tier of awesome. Why can't she just be the awesome one in the relationship? Why can't she partner with someone on a lower tier? Why can't a girl be the high achiever/smart one/bread winner for once? The answer lies in implicit sexism.

In canon, Hermione is the Deputy Director of the DMLE. That's an awesome job, and she probably continues to climb past what we've heard so far. Ron just runs the shop with George after working with the Aurors for a few years. No where in canon does it say that Ron ascribes to traditional roles. If anything, he was probably a stay-at-home-dad because there was more flexibility in his job. Find a new argument.

(Also, if I had to pick, I would say that Ron wound up with the short-end of the stick. Hermione - bless her soul - can be quite nasty and mean at times. I would never want to be treated like that by my spouse.)

**** The argument that "Hermione deserves better" is sexist regardless of who says it. You're just the latest victim. Find a new argument.

Although, your comments about Molly being his only role model for what a wife and mother should be was actually pretty sexist. First of all, it's inaccurate: Tonks was a pretty kickass mom, albeit the fact that she wasn't in that role for very long..and Ron really looked up to Tonks. Also, he grew up hearing about the sacrifices that Lily Potter and Alice Longbottom made for their children - children they brought into the world while fighting on the losing side of a deadly war. And this isn't even counting the non-mother women who were role models in the story (e.g. McGonagall). It's not like Ron couldn't envision a women who wasn't his mother.

In fact, Molly Weasley (and Petunia Dursley - a Muggle) are the only women in the story who even fit the "traditional" role. So, for all we know, that's not even the norm in wizarding society...oh, but you assumed it was.

** Look, I'll be the first to admit I don't think Ron and Hermione have great chemistry together, but to suggest Ron didn't mature at all through the series and that he'd expect Hermione to be some sort of submissive, baby-making housewife just because his mother is one, is ridiculous.

Your arguments aren't based in canon; they're the typical fanon dreck that your average Weasley-bashing Harmony-shipper uses as weak justification for castrating Ron in those shitty indy!Harry fics.

** I agree with you about Draco, but disagree about Ron. I think you're suffering from a common problem, that until recently I didn't realise I also had, where you've lost track of canon. A lot of ideas and character tropes that float around in fanfiction can sort of bias your opinion without you even noticing. For me, when I reread Naruto (an even worse fandom for this to happen, due to both the length and the fact that later canon trampled on the earlier material) I realised how much crap was purely invented - to the extent that original canon actually felt new and different to what I expected.

I recommend rereading canon and looking at how Ron and Hermione interact. I would wager that most of the problems you mention (e.g. Ron thinking Hermione should be a housewife) are based on extrapolating minor details for quite a long way. Per canon, they get on well most of the time, and find each other physically attractive. They also have a lot of shared trauma. Also, they simply don't have close ties to many other people their age. Hermione's other (male) prospects are limited to Harry, Neville and maybe George or Percy, if we limit her to people she already knows (and if you look around in real life, you'll notice people /tend/, as a rule of thumb, to fall for people they already know, especially when they're young) - and even if we don't, there aren't many wizards her age anyway. For Ron, it's basically Lavender, Pavarti/Padma, or Luna that he knows.

It's also quite easy to find points of conflict. The odds of two people perfectly matching is almost zero - if there were a couple with no conflict at all, it would break my suspension of disbelief. For example, Hermione's opinion of Divination is uncommon, and yet Ron agrees with her that the subject is stupid (an opinion not held by e.g. Lavender - you could easily argue that this makes them fundamentally incompatible, due to how into Divination Lavender is for part of the series). However, most places where Ron is really one of the only people Hermione matches with don't stand out. He's willing to respect her intelligence, and accept her conclusions. He doesn't look down on muggle stuff (like the car he's learned to drive in the epilogue). Hermione also supports Ron quite nicely - she motivates him and pushes him out of his comfort zone, as well as having a long-term drive that compliments his short-term headstrong drive.

I'm not a Ron/Hermione shipper, but as per canon, they really do work - not amazingly, like two pieces of a puzzle, but more realisticly, like two flawed people that compliment each other.

Draco, on the other hand, is (up until the end of book 7) a brat, to be blunt. He acts like a child; he doesn't think things through; he lacks empathy and emotional control; he's generally a hateful person. Of course, we only see him near people he hates (i.e. Harry & co.) but there's nothing there for shippers to use as justification for a canon!Draco and anyone ship, at least during Hogwarts. In the epilogue, he seems to have mellowed out somewhat, and if an author wants to write an AU, that's fine, but I loathe it when authors disregard canon and then claim their stories are 'canon-compliant' when the characters in it are basically OCs except with cunning disguises - namely, that they have canon-compliant names.

It's perfectly fine to say 'I know it's not canon, but I think this character doesn't mesh with this one' - that's why we're on a fanfiction subreddit, after all. The problem is probably that you're trying to appeal to canon and saying that your opinion is the 'correct' one based on the books, and everyone who disagrees sees it as a bit of an insult (just guessing, but I can see why they'd feel that way).

Most of your argument is fanon. Harmony-shipper fanon to be exact. This isn't a Harmony forum. I doubt you will find a lot of support and you certainly won't find mine.

** She didn't "draw the short stick", she chose to marry someone she loved.

You can disagree that Hermione /should/ have done that, you can disagree that on the evidence of canon, she and Ron would work well together, but she made that choice.

(Unless you think she was forced into it, in which case I don't care about your opinion at all.)

So clearly she saw, and continues to see things differently from you. And given that Hermione seems to be fine with Ron after 19 years, than either you're wrong about her character, or Ron's. If you respect Hermione as a character as much as you seem to, than you must accept that Ron /doesn't/ expect Hermione not to have a career/stay at home, or if he did, than they have worked past these issues.

Edit: As a sidenote, there doesn't seem to be any Wizarding equivalent to college, and I can't see Hermione attending a muggle one.

**** I think the issue, for me, at least, isn't the idea of whether Hermione and Ron would be good together or not, it's your categorical assumption that Hermione and Ron aren't good together because of Ron.

Hermione has as many bad traits as Ron: she's overbearing, demanding, nosy, can be annoying, et cetera... very, very few people want to have a partner like that. Yet, you gloss over Hermione's negative traits and pillory Ron for perceived lack of maturity, and an antiquated view of women that Rowling has /literally never/ indicated he has, while not giving him an ounce of credit for what he does in canon.

Your arguments are Hermione-wank. They are the same as those that led to the annoying, Mary Sue, super-Hermione we see in the movies: a near infallible encyclopedia who sucks most of Ron's (and even some of Harry's) lines and ideas in order to prop her up as this genius.

**** No, Rowling wrote about a character making that decision. There's an important distinction there. If you remove the agency from the character, you don't have characters, and there is no longer any point discussing how Hermione and Ron might have treated one another.

"The characters as they are written" may or may not make sense together (that's a position I don't really have an opinion on, as I don't ship anything) but we /know/ that they did work together. Sometimes things that shouldn't work, do. A 11-year-old boy shouldn't be able to survive an encounter with the most feared wizard of all time. But he /does/ - and not because that's how things normally work, but because there was information we as readers didn't know. Clearly, there is something about Hermione's character that you're not inferring properly.

(I'm no expert on it, but I've heard that the comment by Rowling has been taken out of context. Still, the canon of what is written must surely have supremacy over later comments. Hermione is seen to be happy in her marriage, therefore she is. Might she have been more happy with Harry? Perhaps, but that's the realm of fanfiction - in canon, she is happy, and doesn't seem to be seeking other options.)

**** Actually if you read the whole wonderland interview not just the lying media online articles you'll see there's nowhere that Rowling said she regrets pairing Ron and Hermione together.

As for making no sense together, it's probably too long for me to write up an entire essay, so maybe I will just list a few points to get us thinking: 1) He cared for her personal life in a way that Harry her other best friend never did 2) He offer qualities like humour among others things that she really needs in a relationship 3) He can handle her bossiness and nagging either by listening to her when he thinks she's right (even though he might have forgotten about it) or by arguing back or by returning a quip that appeased her among other ways. It's much better than how Harry handles it which mainly involves ignoring, lying or exploding at her because sometimes he's really too independent for his own good. When Harry and Ron both disagree with Hermione over some issues, Harry usually lets Ron engage with Hermione. 4) He has always praised her intelligence and brilliance a lot and we know Hermione likes to be seen as right or be complimented by others

I also agree with what Zeitgeist84 said, it seems your anti-Romione stance is just Ron bashing and glossing over Hermione's fault. If you're going to argue against Romione at least discuss faults with both characters.

** Yawn. Heard it all before, read it all before.

I sort of agree and do ship Harry/Hermione but I just laugh at people that get worked up about the topic of relationships in works of fiction. IMO Hermione was better suited to Harry, end of story. They were both the most consistently loyal people in the entire series and once again (IMO) deserved each other.

A number of your points are dead wrong. Hermione is not independent, asides from her misguided attempt at SPEW she is never shown doing her own thing, plus she turns into an emotional wreck when Ron leaves during DH. We never get to see what Ron's idea of a wife is or if Hermione accepts that. Maybe Hermione has a career and Ron learned to compromise? Maybe no compromise was needed, do you understand just how much a person can change in 19 years?

Seriously, just forget about the epilogue. If you hate it so much that you feel the need to dissect it then go write your own fanfic.

** I have a question for you, my dear UrTwiN. What exactly were you expecting when you typed up this post with your lack of ability to separate paragraphs or know what you're talking about? Were you expecting to get shit tons of upvotes and comments about how "OmfG, dis is so tru!11!1!" This ain't Tumblr, where you can spout the most mindless of cancer and then drown in praise about how right you totes are.

Although, Reddit does do that from time to time.

  Ron is a pure blood
#+end_quote

I thought it was depressing enough when retards whined about cis white males, now they're whining about the blood status of fictional characters, when racism is one of the main themes that's dealt with time and time again. Great job UrTwiN. Let me know how you managed an upvote percentage as high as 43% again.

#+begin_quote
  I have no doubt that this is the exact thing Ron would expect from a wife
#+end_quote

And I have no doubt that your brain cells flew out of your ears a long time ago like a stream of mushy peas.

Oh and this bit here

#+begin_quote
  An equally intelligent and hard working muggle at college, Harry?
#+end_quote

The worst part about this post, the absolute worst part is that there's no self awareness here. Not even a scent.

I fucking hate Harmony shippers. I really despise them.

**** u/waylandertheslayer:
#+begin_quote
  It had to do with the fact that practically every pureblood in the HP universe is depicted as not knowing their ass from their heads when it comes to Muggles.
#+end_quote

Ron is one of the few purebloods who this might not apply to. He's been best friends with two muggle-raised children since he was 11, his father works with - and is fascinated by - muggle items, and in the epilogue he has a driver's license (not to mention that he flew a magic car in CoS). Just some food for thought.

**** Oh please, just because Hermione doesn't like some parts of the wizard society doesn't mean she wants to live in the Muggle society. In fact, Hermione was actually doing her best to change the wizard society for the better like the conditions for the house-elves. If Hermione prefers the Muggle society over the wizard society why doesn't she drop out of Hogwarts to go to a Muggle school or go and live in the Muggle world after Voldemort was dead?

Hermione is a Muggle-born witch not a Muggle, and unlike most Slytherins despising her because of her blood status, Ron and the Weasleys are nothing but welcoming of her so even if the Muggle problem exists it's not terribly relevant to their marriage since they will not be living as Muggles.

Ron might not always 100% understand the Muggles, but he is making lots of efforts to learn as waylandertheslayer already said.

** Ron is one of my least favorite and I don't ship the two. But to say that he didn't get any character development is false. As an example, Hermione kissed Ron in the books only after he came back and later came to see the plight of house elves. She didn't follow him when he abandoned Harry.

And I am fully of the belief that if Ron had abandoned them to the end she would have never dated him. But he did.

** Once you manage to crawl out from under the well-deserved dogpile, consider that given her goals at the end of canon --- social reform --- if Hermione wanted to climb the ranks in the Ministry, she could have done much worse than Ron. Consider:

- Among the men close to her in age, the ambitious ones are either Slytherins (whose ambition is quite questionable in the first place) or Percy; so she doesn't really have anyone with whom to form a proverbial "power couple", so her husband will have to be someone who would work mainly as a prop.
- Ron is a pureblood, and she takes his name when they marry. That makes her less threatening to the proverbial old guard who, while no Voldemort supporters, likely harbor implicit anti-Muggleborn prejudice. (Think Slughorn.)
- Ron is a war hero, but not in a way that would overshadow her the way Harry would. No matter how illustrious her Ministry career, her achievements are unlikely to ever be as famous or as popular as Voldemort's defeat, and Harry would get 80%+ of the credit for that.
- Ron is a known quantity, and we know that she finds him physically attractive. He is also a rather talented wizard, given that he does significantly above average while putting in the least amount of work she lets him get away with; as is his whole family. I.e., good genes.
- She has few interests in common with Ron, but that's not necessarily a bad thing: it means relatively few demands from him on her time, so she can focus on her career.

So, all things considered, if she wants to be the Minister of Magic in a few decades, Ron is not a bad choice.
