When Remus was bitten, his mother was pregnant (with a boy or a girl, doesn't matter). After their new baby was born, Hope and Lyall decided to give it up for adoption because they were afraid that Greyback would come back for it.

Baby Lupin comes to Hogwarts during the Marauders' fifth year looking very much like their older brother.


** I remember there was a time-travel fanfic that ultimately got abandoned based on the premise that Remus had a twin brother named Romulus that died at childbirth(the fact that he had a twin was actually the reason he was able to time travel).

** For a moment I thought it was Ron has a baby sibling and hoped you had the same plot bunny running around about how we are told that witches and wizards can have babies really late (James Potter's parents apparently were already elderly when they had him) and how Molly and Arthur always had a full house and then after the war suffered an empty nest syndrome and because of that we have little Weasleys running around the same age as the next generation...
