** My Immortal was pretty horrifying. I lost my hope in humanity the day I finished reading it, and that hurt more than the time I lost my virginity. Let me tell ya. Going in raw that night wasn't a good idea. That combined with me completely missing my aim and managing to get into the wrong hole led to an experience that was truly horrific. Oooh boy. Bad memories.

Anyway, now that I've traumatised you, I should probably give you a recommendation lest the mods delete my comment before finding my address and sending our sentient AI overlord Sir Fanficbot after my life.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2452681/1/Evil-Be-Thou-My-Good][Evil Be Thou My Good]] was a decent horror fic.
