***** That's one. There was also one where Harry thought Hogwarts was an asylum, with Slytherin being the house for sane people and the others for the inmates. Dumbledore managed the asylum but was, for some reason, also insane. He justified performing magic as 'playing along' for his less sane friends' benefit.

It was a weird fic.

Is the first one, but they don't really get to the Dudley part in that one. It's super long and occasionally prone to what I call “perfect worlding” where there's so much stuff the main characters are given, and it feels a bit like a fantasy. But it's still a fun read, particularly the first book.

Using the wizards own backwards mindset and stupidity to not only find a way to be safe at the dursleys, but also to carve out a place of his own in both worlds.

Meh, I still would like JKR to do a rewrite or AU series that is not only geared for adult/mature audiences, but explores real life reactions to the events that happened. Like harry dealing with the effect of emotional abuse from the dursleys, or if Albus really was doing it for all wizard kind, or just lying his beard off and using people.

******* Have you read any of her adult works? I read The Casual Vacancy, and after that I give a lot more credence to interpretations of the Wizarding World as a dystopia of sorts. It's very bleak and takes a dim view of human nature. And further works such as the FB movies seem to bear this out as far as the governments and societies she creates.

I really think you see the effects of Harry's emotional abuse in the books that are there- he never has more than the first two friends he makes, he doesn't question a lot of things that he should, many many fanfiction writers have brought up his willingness to sacrifice himself and rush into dangerous situations as evidence that he doesn't value himself very highly, etc. Some people think that emotional abuse means the person experiencing it is going to be broken afterwards or try to self-harm or whatnot, but in my experience that's not always the case. Most don't even get therapy, and for a lot they don't even recognize their family as "abusive" or even wrong until a lot later in life when they've gotten away from them and talked about their experiences with other people. A common theme on [[/r/raisedbynarcissists]] is someone tells another person a story about their childhood and the /other person/ bursts into tears or is haunted or made intensely angry by it, while the storyteller has little emotion and is surprised by the other's reaction- that's just the way things were, to them.
