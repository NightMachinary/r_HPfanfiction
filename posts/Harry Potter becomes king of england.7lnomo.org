I am looking for fics where Harry finds excalibur and becomes king. Complete stories preferred. Thanks!


** FYI the Kingdom of England ceased to exist in 1707 when England and Scotland merged to form the Kingdom of Great Britain, which in turn was replaced by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801, which was itself replaced by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1922.

The 1707 date is interesting as it is also the date of the founding of the Ministry for Magic.

**** I mean, why would you even want Harry as leader of a constitutional monarchy? It's not like he would have absolute power like rulers in the 17th and 18th century.

I think you are looking for "Emperor Harry" fics, not "King of England Harry".

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

** More or less this fits the bill. Not Excalibur but Harry essentially does become the king of England.
