From what I can remember, Harry beats Voldemort and becomes the MOD, he helps Andromeda and Teddy and didn't return to Hogwarts for his 7th year, rather getting trained by the ministry. Andromeda has a mental breakdown and Harry has to become more hands on With Teddy as Andromeda can't be alone with him. He gets Fleur's Aunt (or second grandmother) who is a mind healer to come work with Andy and himself. He often returns to speak to Hermione, who is a bit of a sadistic domme to Ron who is a very willing masochist although there are hits that she is in love With Harry. Harry gets a Raven that acts as his familiar.
