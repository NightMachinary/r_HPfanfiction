:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi guys! I remember being obsessed with reading ffns that had the "Hogwarts reads books" trope a few years ago. I'm trying to find this specific one where angels Michael, Gabriel, Raphael and I believe Azazel were included. They were posing as students and had a more prominent voice as the chapters went by. IIRC, the writer stopped or took a break around the 4th book.

If anyone remembers or by some miracle actually knows the name of this fanfiction, please let me know! Thank you :)


** the only one similar i know of, is one where james and lily read Jade Angel, and are joined by sirius, remus, neville's dad, and Loki/Gabriel

** One that I know is where Harry befriend Lucifer and convince that restarting the war is a bad idea. So he stayed in hogwarts,Gabriel not wanting to pick a side between brothers hides in hogwarts, Michael not wanting to be forced to fight Luci hides in hogwarts. But none of that imvolves reading.
