Not only that but his body becomes once again underdeveloped for his magical knowledge and has to go back to Hogwarts to study everything all over again. Fortunately Harry Potter is going to be the same year as him(her) and he(she) can pretend to befriend him while attempting to kill him. Unfortunately he(she) develops an unnatural fondness for Harry Potter's sidekick, Ron Weasley and thus in the final year he(she) decides to join the two in their quest for destroying Horcruxes, otherwise knowing he(she)'ll never get the girl body and will have no chance with his(her) crush.

However as Ron decides to walk out on them in the middle of the quest, he gets abducted by Snatchers who recognize him as Harry Potter's friend so they take him to the present day Voldemort for interrogation. Present day Voldemort also becomes fond of Ron Weasley and now Future Voldemort and Present day Voldemort are waging war for his affection.


** The idea of Voldemort becoming fond of Ron Weasley of all characters sounds hilarious. I think what'd make this more entertaining is that the girl that Voldemort becomes is Hermione Granger and ohhh it fits.

*** Just imagine if all Hermione's plans were in fact thwarted plots to kill Harry which get misinterpreted as good intentions. She deliberately set Snape on fire when he was trying to counterjinx Harry's broom and kept convincing Harry to practice Occlumency in his fifth year just so that the same mistake of Harry going to the DoM and ruining everything is not repeated.

**** Well, at some point she'd have to want Harry to survive and defeat Voldemort if she wants Ron, so hmm around 4th year I guess she'd actually want Harry to succeed?

Actually, what you've just proposed might work for a totally different story prompt.

One fic where Voldemort as Hermione wants to destroy Harry until she falls for Ron and realizes Harry has to defeat Voldemort to make that happen and one fic where Hermione is just trying to hinder and defeat Harry at every turn but is woefully unsuccessful.

***** Well it could be just something that Hermione/Voldemort doesn't fully understand until he(she) gets jealous of Ron and Lavender.

** Slight change, he (LV) keeps getting killed and reliving his life.

So he has to become his own balance -

With time he stops helping voldemort and starts fighting for himself and later others who also suffer.

** Ooooh it would also make a lot of sense why Hermionemort is so obnoxious and disliked because Voldemort can't give a fuck about these "stupid toddlers" in order to play nice, and he pretends to be crying in the toilet on Halloween so that Harry and Ron would come rescue him (her) and get killed by that troll.
