All kinds of fics welcome, though something that actually deals with the aftermath of losing something as essential as magic would be nice.

A dark!Harrt Tomarry in which pureblood supremacist Tom is suddenly in love with a squib would be a delight.

Thank you!

edit: I should really stop posting requests and should just post prompts instead.


** This sounds like Carry On by Rainbow Rowell

"home fries nazi"

This is actually snarry, but anyone with a dark mark lost their magic when harry killed voldemort. Ironically, Harry's scar caused him to lose his magic along with the death eaters. Most go suicidal with depression. And then there's Snape serving breakfast at some random muggle diner in America. Treating the cooking with the same rigidity he did potions. Depressed harry stumbles upon snape, where snape grudgingly takes him under his wing
