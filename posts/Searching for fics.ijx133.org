Harry is master of death. He goes back in time, adopts Tom and take to his new house. Tom goes to Harry study or office and finds him talking to someone. He tries to eavesdrop but Death announces his presence. I think Harry introduces Death as Mort. Harry tells Tom that death is his close friend. Tom is possessive of Harry. While walking to dinning room, Death teases Tom by getting close to Harry, which angers Tom. Then Tom gets smug as he takes the seat next to Harry to Harry and Death watch in amusement. Harry is oblivious to all of this or pretends to be.

2) Tom is in his fifth year maybe, Harry is Lord Peverell. He's adopts Tom and tells him they are cousins. Tom tries to know about Harry through Abraxas. Harry takes Tom to his cottage telling this is now Tom home as well.

Please help ðŸ¥º


** Strive on ao3 is pretty similar to this. Harry becomes the DADA professor and Tom gets jealous pretty much instantly. Death is kinda involved too.

  Tom Riddle finds that he does not like it when Professor Potter doesn't pay him any attention. Something should be done about that.
