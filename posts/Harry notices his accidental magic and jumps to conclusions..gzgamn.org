Are there any fanfic out there where young Harry is not oblivious enough to ignore the powers he obviously possesses? He could talk to a snake and jump to the conclusion that he is the anti-christ, and goes in a panic because he doesn't want to destroy the world. Or he apparates on the roof and jumps to the conclusion that he is a superhero and the Dursleys are so mean to him because this is his sad backstory. He could belief himself to be an alien or some human experiment, I don't care as long as he acknowledges his powers.


** All three of these are unfinished, but well worth the read.

Harry Potter and the Consequences of a Trip to the Library in Primary School (series) by TheWizzard: Harry figures out that what he's doing is magic. linkao3(12915570) /[ETA: Self-Study is the first story in this series. Sorry that the link didn't match the title I gave.]/

Fairy Tale by Araceil: Harry figures out he has magic powers and models his self-training on what he found in the manga series. linkffn(9596404)

Storybook Hero by DogbertCarroll doesn't start until Hagrid's visit, but is wonderfully entertaining (quote below) and definitely slips over the line into crack. linkffn(7597067)

  Harry stared at Griphook, who stared back at him a bit unnerved by the small boy who was eying him, considering most wizards either sneered or tried to pretend he was human.

  "If I catch you do I get anything?"

  "That's leprechauns, all you'll get from me is a thump round the ears."

  "Solve your riddle?"

  "That's the sphinx for passage past what they're guarding or a date." Griphook rolled his eyes.

  "Bribe you with something?"

  "Now that's goblins!" Griphook said proudly while Harry took out a note pad.

  "Excellent! Do you have a list of prices and services?"

  Since he was punished everytime strange things were happening Harry drew the conclusion that he was causing them. Looking for answers, the librarian sent him to the fantasy section. Harry realized he was a wizard and dedicated all his free time to find the grain of truth in every fantasy book he read. When a magical letter appeared and Harry was invited to Hogwarts he was bursting with joy. He might lack knowledge of "real" magic and the "real" magical world but life lessons from fictional characters, a few handy magical tricks and an open mind would make up for it.

** linkffn(A Gritty Reboot)

This fic is amazing! It's just a one shot, but I stand by the opinion that's it's one of the best things written in this fandom.

Harry realizes that he has some sort of power, does some research(mostly through comic books) to figure out what's up, has a very short lived career in vigilantism, and more!

** Not quite what you're looking for but in This is not the Chosen One you're looking for he is the antichrist. It's a crossover with Good Omens

linkffn(7404385)

Or the link for AO3 is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4452626/chapters/10116017]]

Although I would say you don't have to have read Good Omens but it might have spoilers in I can't remember. So I would recomend reading the book first as the book is great. Plus the tv show is awesome too.

*** Thanks for the recommendation. Just read it, was a real fun read. I went in thinking it wasn't completed because of how short it is, but it dealth with both Good Omens and HP plotline quite well.

** linkffn(Of Wands and Kunai by Womgi). Officially abandoned, but has Harry run across some Naruto manga and decide that he can be a ninja.

And, it's not deliberate on Harry's part, but linkffn(GodEmperor of Little Whinging by Polydicta) is a crack take on it.

  A 7 year old Harry stumbles on a box of old Naruto manga. Inspired, he reaches deep within, using chakra to quickly become a phenomenal ninja. And thus begins a curious tale. Read and see how it ends! Read 1st chapter A/N...story is officially abandoned.
