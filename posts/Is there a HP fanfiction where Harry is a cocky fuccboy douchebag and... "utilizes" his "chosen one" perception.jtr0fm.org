** This is quite prevalent in wbwl fics, although it isn't the mc who is famous in that case.

** I have this set up in one of my fics, but it only has 2 chapters so far. It basically is J/L survive Halloween '81 and Harry (BWL) is a celebrity; he gets an Order of Merlin and Death Eaters attack the ceremony, leading James/Lily to lock him up alone his whole childhood until Hogwarts to protect him. His only visitor is Sirius, who is a ladies man.... so Harry becomes a man-slut as soon as he's able, cashing in on his fame for a bunch of one-night stands.

It will be a romance, though, rather than focusing on that aspect.
