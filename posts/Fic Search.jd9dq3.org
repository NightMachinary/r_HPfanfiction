I read a fic about a year ago. In it in Harry's 4th or 5th year, Ginny adopts Sirius so he can live with Harry in the castle. But after some time, Sirius becomes a normal dog after staying as an Animagus for too long. It's a one-shot.

Any help would be appreciated.

Thank you.


** That's linkao3(True Form by TheLoud). It really left an impression on me too.

  Since Ron got a new owl, it's only fair that Ginny gets her own pet. She adopts a big black dog.
