Once you accept the premise, it's got an interesting Potter family dynamic: there are 'justifications' for the abandonment; everybody isn't infinitely repentant, or absolutely callous; his siblings have mixed feelings towards him; and it just works, at an emotional level.

The Prince of Slytherin comes close, and while it is more dramatic and plot driven, it's also quite a bit more contrived (extra prophesies and what not).

Can we create a list or something of other stories of this kind: stories that have a trope-y premise, but deal with things very competently and very realistically. For example, would love to read other WBWL stories of this caliber.


** I feel like I should note that it is very possible that Prince of Slytherin isn't actually a WBWL fic, but a [[/spoiler][BWL-Jim and his Horcrux Twin-Harry]].

*** The more I read the more I really, really wanna know what happened on October 31st.

Lilly and James don't know. Dumbledore doesn't know. My guess is Voldemort doesn't either. The only person with a plausible theory theory is /Lucius Malfoy/, of all people.

** The best WBWL series I've read is linkffn(unknown relations: the philosopher's stone) hands down. Harry was raised as Orion Black, Sirius' son, and his twin Hayden thinks he died young and carries tremendous guilt about it. The Potters have complicated feelings about giving him away and it shows, and Sirius is a badass Chief Auror who raises Orion to be self sufficient and trust competent adults, in contrast to his twin Hayden who was raised in isolation and is much more immature. It is abandoned in fifth year.

** Colours series. [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/274173]]

It's got alive!Potters, a Neville-BWL, and a jealous, powerful, asshole!Harry who is gradually alienated from his family. Reasonably well written, but the problem with the series is this: James' alienates him right from the start; Lily is his bulwark, and she supposedly loves him, but her actions in book 2/3 seem highly contrived from my (a readers') pov and constructed to give Harry a concentrated dose of angst. Additionally, Harry is unreasonably offputting in the start and while he does get better, it's still irritating.

Still, in terms of dysfunctional potter family dynamics, this really hits the spot. Lily and James absolutely shit on the poor guy in Book 2/3, and without the crutch of physical harm.
