Maybe Voldemort was a flop, maybe it was someone else who tried to operate at the same time as Voldemort. Either way, no one seems to remember much about the person who killed Harry's parents, but they're pretty sure that someone has told him who it was at some point, and this is the reason why they always refer to Harry's parents' killer as "you know who".


** You know, I'm surprised we haven't seen more of the "Harry joins Voldemort" writers using a variant of this. It would be much easier to convince Harry to join Voldemort if it wasn't actually the Dark Lord that killed his parents. What if Voldemort had been leading a low-level, mostly political campaign up until the prophecy and when he actually hears about it from Snape he simply decides to not act on it? Instead, it could be that Bellatrix, a radical in even this hypothetical universe, takes a few like-minded individuals (like Crouch Jr.) and murders Lily and James Potter, only failing to kill Harry through the timely intervention of the other Marauders.

Wizarding Britain recoils from the news of these murders as you would expect and Voldemort's plans are set back by years due to the damage to the movement's image. This, of course, isn't a major impediment to a man who has theoretically obtained immortality, it will simply mean another decade or two rebuilding the public trust, but now the Dark Lord has to worry about Harry growing up under Dumbledore's tutelage to seek revenge on the man he must believe ordered his parents' deaths.

You could go almost anywhere with this premise. Maybe Voldemort makes his move early and manages to get the Malfoy's to take custody of Harry, after disposing of Sirius or somehow making him ineligible to be guardian. Maybe Harry goes to the Dursley's as usual but when he arrives at Hogwarts it isn't stammering Professor Quirrel teaching DADA but the intelligent and charismatic Professor Dolohov, who slowly gains Harry's trust and introduces him to new viewpoints and magic Dumbledore and the other teachers might not /trust/ him with. Maybe he does nothing and story picks up after Hogwarts, with Harry working inside the Ministry or with the Order of the Phoenix to take the Dark Lord down, up until he learns that what he has been told and assumed correct all these years has been completely wrong.

Damn, makes me want to write something.

Edit: Thinking on it, there would actually be quite a lot of differences to work from with this AU. Sirius wouldn't be arrested, Peter wouldn't be a traitor, the Death Eaters might not have so bad of a reputation when Harry goes to school, there would be a lot more students at Hogwarts due to the lack of a war, and Snape could be radically different depending on whether or not he turned double agent or even cares to watch over Harry in the absence of a real threat from Voldemort. He could just be written out of the story or he could end up in some new and interesting role. Hell, throw him in charge of the apothecary in Diagon Alley if you like, the sky's the limit!

*** Would they even be /called/ Death Eaters if Voldemort's campaign was pretty much just a political movement, since it's such an "obviously evil" name? I'd think in this AU, the Death Eaters would solely refer to the radicalized movement spawned by Bellatrix Lestrange.

Also, would there even be a curse on the Defense professorship, given a less vindictive Voldemort? If no, which political faction would the long-term Defense Professor be? Would Voldemort be able to get any of his supporters in a position of authority over children?

Sirius would actually be in a /prime/ position to take care of Harry - and not influence him too much politically. He seems like the kind of character to stay out of politics altogether.

**** You're right on all counts, I just didn't want to make the comment too lengthy or confuse people too much by changing terms. There's a lot of wiggle room to change or outright ignore parts of canon in this AU.

*** Read linkao3(My Darkest Devotion by Lomonaaeren) It's basically the last scenario you described, and is very well written.

  Harry Potter has been hiding in plain sight all his life, since he carries the soul-mark of Minister Tom Riddle on his arm---and a fulfilled soul-bond will double both partners' power. His parents and godfather are fugitives, members of the Order of the Phoenix, and Harry is a junior Ministry official feeding the Order what information he can. No one, least of all him, expects Harry to come to the sudden notice of Minister Riddle, or be drawn into a dangerous game of deception.
