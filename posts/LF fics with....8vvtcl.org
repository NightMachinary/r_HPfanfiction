Any non slash pairing Over 80k words Anyone except Hermione bashing. If it's huna or harmony that's an added plus.

Thanks in advance


** Go to fanfiction site. Harry Potter section. Filters: words >80k, main characters Harry + Hermione (or Luna), or use pairing tag if on Ao3. Continue narrowing with genre and ratings if desired.

*** I think you are underestimating just how bored I get.

I have ~40 hrs a week that I have to fill with something at work and for the last year or so that's been Harry Potter fanfics, my search at this point is no slash and I feel week by week even that resolve slipping.
