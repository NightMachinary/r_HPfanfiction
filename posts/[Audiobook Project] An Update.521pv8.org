Hello, everyone,

I'm very sorry for my absence, the project is still going on, and I would like to thank every voice actor who has sent voice lines.

My microphone has just arrived, and I finished splicing Ginny's lines into individual files. I plan to start recording tomorrow so you should see an upload either Sunday or sometime next week.

Thanks, everyone,

Best Regards,

ThePianoProdigy
