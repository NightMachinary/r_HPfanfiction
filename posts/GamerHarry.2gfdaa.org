So I can't find a thing on Google but I read a fic a while ago where Harry became a gamer over the summer and he made all kinds of pop-culture references. The fic was hilarious but I can't find it anywhere. Please help! Edit: found it. turns out I had recc'd it on here before [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9807593/23/Harry-Potter-the-Geek]]
