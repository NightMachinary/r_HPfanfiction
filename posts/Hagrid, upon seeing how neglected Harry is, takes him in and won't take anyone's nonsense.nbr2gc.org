"Look Dumbledore, yer a good man but get yer head out of yer arse. The lad needs a safe place to be and love and them rotten Dursleys aren't giving it to him."

2 weeks into term, Snape struggling to open his quarters, sleeps on the hallway, goes to breakfast. "Ya know Snape keeper of the keys isn't some random title, I control who can and can't get into any locked space in this here castle. Maybe ya best be nice to the students, especially little Harry"

Headline:Voldemort and followers dead having been killed by a horde of what we are told are called Blast-ended Skrewts


** Perfect setup for a Beastmaster! Harry, where his affinity for dealing with creatures extends to basically everything. Baby dragon? I think you mean NEW BEST FRIEND! Basilisk? Dump down a heat lamp and wait for it to go to sleep under it. Acromantula? Bit too many of them here Hagrid, maybe move them to a heavily warded magical preserve and set up a silk business on the side. Another Dragon, but this one is nesting? Forfit the task, then go on a 3 hour rant to the organisers about how idiotic it is to put nesting dragons in and how this could have led to the deaths of several clutches of eggs. Have to be restrained from extreme violence once it's known that some of the eggs didn't make it.

Anyway, basically this.

** I've considered the idea before of having Harry be some sort of exotic dark creature, like something from the very worst sort of fanfiction, but instead of the story revolving around that, Hagrid immediately adopts him and won't let anyone interfere. So Harry just lives with Hagrid now, and that's the whole story. Harry living with Hagrid and Hagrid telling everybody else to bugger off. I intended it to be a deliberate subversion of the elder vampire quarter banshee nephilim incubus nonsense.

Still, there's merits to Hagrid just adopting Harry anyway without an excuse. I don't think I've ever seen it anywhere before. It might be an interesting excuse to go with some of the more unusual and underused ideas some people have thrown around, like the notion that Hagrid must actually be quite good at magic and quite good in a fight: he keeps the creatures in the forest at bay through fear of angering him, which means Hagrid is extremely dangerous when he wants to be. And he can manage partial human Transfigurations and mid-tier Charms with a */broken wand/*. We know good and well how hard having an unsuitable or broken wand can affect spellcasting; we have Neville for most of the books and Ron in second year as examples. Hagrid managed to put a pig tail on Dudley and regularly charms the pumpkin patches and Christmas trees with the snapped pieces of a wand encased inside an umbrella. That's actually kind of incredible. And others have also pointed out in various fics that Hagrid must be accomplished at Occlumency, because Dumbledore trusts him to keep secrets, and even Quirrelmort had to get him drunk and talking to learn what he wanted to know about Fluffy; they couldn't just pull it out of Hagrid's head.

Naturally, I think the real reason Legilimency wasn't used book 1 is because Rowling hadn't invented it yet, just like how Dumbledore flew to the Ministry on a broomstick because she hadn't invented apparation, the floo, or portkeys yet. But even so, canon must be retroactive for it to be valid, which means either Legilimency doesn't work on people with giant blood, or Hagrid actually knows Occlumency. For the purposes of a story, you could easily claim the latter over the former.

So there's potentially quite a bit of skills Harry could pick up from living with Hagrid. They actually compliment each other very well. Harry can actually cook, at least according to the fandom, while Hagrid is skilled at hunting and growing produce. The two of them working together would never want for good food. Hagrid could teach Harry how to fight, how to hunt, whatever tricks it is he's using to use advanced Transfigurations and Charms with a broken wand, and possibly Occlumency.

Harry could end up being quite the competent and dangerous teenager after a few years of Hagridization.

[EDIT]

The more I think about this, the more I want to write it. I've been trying to get back into writing by working on another project, but this really tickles my fancy. I might pick this up, if no one objects.

*** I would 100% read this. Hagrid is underutilized in the Fandom. And it's clear he very much loves Harry. Also in addition to everything you said think about the Skewrts. Hagrid engineered an entirely new species of creature that is seemingly immune to magic can breathe fire and is extremely durable. Thats the sort of science that generally is done by someone with multiple P.H.Ds. it's not like it's a simple crossbreed. And he did this while doing his 2 jobs at hogwarts because he didn't stop being Groundskeeper when he became a teacher. So, kinda makes you wonder if Dumbledore sent Hagrid isn't because Dumbledore is incompetent like some fanfic suggest but because he literally can't think of anyone safer. Best of all, Hagrid being powerful is a secret between him and Dumbledore. A secret weapon so to speak for if Dumbledore falls.

**** Wasn't Harry able to stun the skrewt in the maze? IIRC, the skrewt shot fire from its back- end to lunge at its prey

Comparing Hagrid to someone with multiple Phds is a bit of of an overstatement. The guy didn't have any idea of what he created. He didn't know their diet, their behaviour or the difference between the sexes. I mean he even suggested 14 year olds to take the thing for walks. Smh

*** Please, if you decide to write this, tell us here. I'm pretty sure quite a few of us would absolutely love to read a story like that! Also I feel like people sometimes forget how good Hagrid is at training magical creatures despite that being one of his main jobs. It's stated in the books that he has the only tamed herd of thestrals in the entire UK, he managed to successfully tame a Cerberus, raised an acromantula while still a teenager, and got Grawp, a giant, a species typically known for fighting, violence, inter-species fighting, and brutality, to not only speak English, but also politely sit in a tuxedo at Dumbledore's funeral. I feel like that's the real reason Dumbledore always refused to fire Hagrid, the half-giant knew his job and did it better than anyone else ever could have.

**** Nah, he was great at taming creatures and bonding with them. But he was a shit teacher. The guy after the Buckbeak incident, wastes the entire year on Flobberworms. Starting that year with a hippogriff was also a mistake. It is a XXX creature that adults can handle; not 13 year olds. (Buckbeak attacking is Draco's fault)

Next year he takes two creatures and then crosses them, creating a new hybrid without the ministry's permission. He doesn't know anything about them, not their diets, behaviour etc. How did he think that teaching 14 year olds about them is a good idea? He wastes the entire year on them, except the nifflers and the unicorn foal class.

Grubbly-plank was a better teacher than Hagrid. Most students, except Harry's gang didn't like him as a teacher. Ravenclaws considered him a joke, including Luna. Even Harry knew that Grubbly-plank was a better teacher

IMO, Albus should have appointed Grubbly-plank, and if needed make Hagrid as a teaching assistant or something

  broken wand
#+end_quote

Dumbledore had a wand that fix broken wands and Hagrid that Dumbledore gave him permission to use magic while looking for Harry... that's not to say Hagrid is not skilled at magic considering he accomplishes all you said with not even three years of formal training and assuming he is not allowed to use magic, he'd normally be a little rusty.

As for the Legilimency part... for a real life explanation you might be right and it wasn't invented yet. However a simple in-universe explanation would be that it requires eye contact and Voldemort's face is covered by a turban (besides he says in GoF that in wraith form he only maintained the power of possession) and being that Hagrid is later proven to be pretty spell-resistant a failed Imperius or Confounding Charm could have exposed Quirrell.

**** Whether Dumbledore used the Elder Wand to repair Hagrid's wand is debatable. It's strongly implied that he has them in pieces only. Olivander explicitly said "and you don't use the pieces, do you?" to Hagrid, implying you CAN work some kind of magic with them.

And even if I grant you that Hagrid has a working wand, human Transfiguration is NEWT/post-NEWT. It's the most advanced kind of Transfiguration that exists. Hagrid was expelled in his */third year/*. He only has three years of formal magical education. But he could put a pig tail on someone with Transfiguration. That's incredible. Either Hagrid has a great deal of magical talent, or he kept studying and practicing magic in secret. Possibly some combination of the two. He does, after all, have infinite access to the Hogwarts library. All year round.

She's not "good" at explaining things. She sounds like an actual lunatic. Her reasoning for Dumbledore being a raging misogynist is that he viewed Lily's love as very powerful, and therefore he's horribly sexist against all women for praising a woman's femininity (love?).
