JK Rowling has never touched the subject about how spells are created in the wizarding world. I want to write a fanfiction where Harry goes to another school where a subject is Spell Creation. So please whatever you think about creation of spells in the Harry Potter universe write in the comments and please write long answers if you have enough time.


** Guess work that requires an understanding of Latin and maybe Greek. If I'm recalling correctly Snape had a bunch of crossed out words in his potions book. You can also add in arithmancy where a created spell matches the social, personality, and heart numbers.

With that said, you should probably have this Spell Creation class as a 5th/6th year elective with Arithmancy and language class as prerequisites.

** You need to decide for your fic whether you want spell creation to be a science or an art.

If its a science, there'll be some sort of mathematical/equation based approach - either using numbers or runes (which can be given pseudo-numerical values) probably would be the best way to go.

If its an art, then there'll be something more to do with intuition in finding the right combination of wand movement and incantation to get the effect that you're looking for. There'll be many different options that all work, some better than others. The key to being good at spell creation would be in finding the variant that works best for the most people, and doing so reasonably quickly. There might be a meditative process involved, or perhaps potions, to achieve a particular state of mind that helps you develop spells. There might be connections to be drawn between what sort of person you are and what sort of spells you can create.

Which way to go depends on how what you're wanting to use those scenes for in your fic. If you want to see Harry struggling with complex STEM like subjects then go for the first one. If you want to see Harry have to explore and develop who he is as a person, like artists often do...then take the second approach.

** I've read a few interesting stories where spell creation was a subject. They had arithmecy (idk how to spell it) and/or runes having links to it, as well as several languages. Most of them were in Latin but an interesting point I found is that Latin may not have a specific word to bring about the intent you want for the spell, so you would need a different language for it. Because of the background knowledge and complexity of something like this, it would likely be offered with the other highest level classes or even after them.

** Magic seems to be somewhat sentient, or acts in response to the mind of the caster. The words used for spells have a meaning, and if magic is sentient, it knows the meaning. I think that the words used for a spell must have an established meaning for an established result- and this is based on magic having memory, not necessarily the caster knowing the meaning of the words.

When harry cast Levicorpus, he didn't know what the word meant, but the magic followed his command because magic has a level of understanding- it understood what that spell was supposed to do. Levi = levitate, corpus = body. So the words used in a spell must be real words that read as orders for what magic should do.

In my version of events, the reason they use latin and greek based spells a lot is because a lot of simple one-word spells were standardised in Europe a long time ago, and we still use them. If you went to asia, they would be using different words to do the same thing.

Maybe, since magic has memory, old spells that use dead languages still work- e.g., even though the caster doesn't know what this very old artefact does, or what the runes on it mean, if they channelled magic through it, there is a good chance that magic will still work as it would have done when the thing was created, because magic doesnt exactly forget instructions. It's like if you turned on an old computer from decades ago, electricity hasnt forgotten how to flow through it's wires.

So magic runs on meaning. Humans ascribe meaning to all sorts of technically meaningless patterns and objects, that's how our psychology works. Maybe thats an evolutionary method of training magic to work the way we want it to.

Of course, there are other aspects of magic that they canonically have in the books- magic likes number patterns (arithmancy), and specific meaningful actions of wand waving, and different people become good at particular types of magic, and there is creativity in how your magic responds to your needs and skills and abilities. But my takeaway is that there are things that are meaningful to us, which we have made meaningful through our own language or actions, which magic understands and works off. And there are rules that are intrinsically meaningful to magic that we have discovered, such as arithmetic patterns and combining ingredients into potions. I also think that magical people have instincts we don't, because I cant think of a logical leap for someone to discover the animagus ritual unless they could instinctively know that doing certain things would have magically significant results.

** i love the idea that a lot of people thinking a spell does something makes the spell work so the class is literally just kids chanting: lumos makes light. lumos makes light. etc but then for a new spell (its a personal thing i have i don't know how many fics use this)
