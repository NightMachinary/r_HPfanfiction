I´m looking for a fic whose main character is going to become the best duelist in the world and thus is doing everything to improve himself/herself. I´d like to see great and reasonable character development and understandable explanations for why the main character struggles or not. It´d be great if the fic isnt about the bwl (I´m tired of those stories), OC are fine, tho. And last but not least, the longer, the better. Epic length fics are the real shit, and I always love to compare how the mc is doing at the beginning with how he has changed at the end.


** Well, linkffn(Fate by TheTrueSpartan) checks quite a few of your boxes, epic length, a MC who isn't BWL works to improve himself, good character development and writing. I'd suggest just going in with the expectation that a character may be OOC compared to canon, but it's explained in a good way partly into the fic.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.

** Note: I forgot to add that I´ve read parts of Hogwarts Battle School which I eventually dropped. The idea was good, but sadly the story didn´t live up to my expectations.
