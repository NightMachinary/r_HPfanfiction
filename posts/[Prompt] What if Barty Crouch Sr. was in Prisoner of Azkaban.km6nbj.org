I feel like Rowling could have introduced Barty Crouch Sr. during /Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban/, even if briefly, so we're already acquainted with him before the big role he takes on in /Goblet of Fire/. She could have written him in as being obsessed with catching Sirius since he was the one who threw Sirius in prison without a trial, and it would be in character given his zealousness towards catching dark wizards, using the Imperius Curse to keep his son under house arrest, and rendering Bertha Jorkins brain-damaged to keep her from telling his dirty laundry. Perhaps this could be done by shifting some of Fudge's role in /PoA/ over to Crouch (like the "Kiss on Sight" order on Sirius). It's underwhelming that Crouch is introduced and killed in the same book and we never hear about him or his son again, despite how integral they are to the plot and Voldemort's plan to return.

I'd be all for seeing a rewrite of the scene in the Three Broomsticks with Fudge to include Crouch Sr. Perhaps his presence changes how the scene goes, with Fudge sort of bragging on his behalf, dragging the details out of him, while Crouch is mostly just sitting there being professional, and only speaking to correct Fudge, or something like that.


** I misread this at first as Jr, so my first thought was "yeah, I've always thought BCJ as the servant in the 2nd prophecy has so much potential."

That still works with this prompt, but, and I know this is fan fiction so you can do whatever you want with characters, I just don't see uptight Crouch sitting in the 3 broomsticks, especially not with Fudge. And I don't think the Head of the Department of the International Cooperation would have the ability to order a kiss on sight.

But Harry wanders Diagon Alley for 3 weeks, which is also an under utilized avenue. He can believably meet anyone by chance.

*** You make good points, but I think you could rationalize each of them out with some creative writing:

- Play up how uncomfortable Crouch is in the Three Broomsticks and/or dealing with Fudge. This gives us an introduction to his character as an adult version of what Percy might turn out to be (which is great foreshadowing for GoF) and also raises the question of /why/ he's there if he's obviously disgusted by it. Presumably something more important than his personal comfort (i.e. any news on Sirius and/or trying to get Fudge to give him oversight on the search).
- Canon doesn't really establish how the Dementors decide who to listen to, right? This leaves a lot of leeway for an author to invent a reason for Crouch to be able to order the Kiss. Maybe it's a set of spells or a coded language and Crouch knows it from when he was running the Death Eater Trials; he's not /supposed/ to use them now that he doesn't have the authority, but maybe he figures this is a 'cast first, ask questions second' situation and he can get away with it. Or maybe the Dementors remember him from the DE trials because he gave them so many victims and they're willing to listen to him because of that and he's willing to risk collateral damage to avoid any possibility of Sirius being found innocent.

In general, I think there's a lot of room to make Crouch the second (third or fourth, considering Fudge and Macnair) villain of PoA, especially if he's initially set up as a joke or washed out bereaucrat and then it's revealed at the end that he's crazy ruthless and willing to sacrifice people left and right to maintain his position. He'd kind of take over the villain in government role from Fudge in this case though. You'd also have to reinvent his role for GoF, since his relative innocence vs his dark past would already have been kind of spoiled in PoA.
