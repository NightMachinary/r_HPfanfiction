I will expand upon this idea if people like it. I will post the gist here and if you want a full on story, I will write here

--------------

The book focuses on a kid who is son of divorced parents. He never really hung out with his dad because around when the kid was 10, the father started to go a bit crazy. So, on the kids 17th birthday he gets to go visit his father who lives in a remote area in the forest. The kid gets there and the father is not there. The kid wanders about, curious as expected and stumbles into a room filled with newspapers clippings about magical occurrences. The father is a fanatic and conspiracy theorist about wizards. But he has been very, very careful - or so he has thought.

So, the kid is walking about this room thinking "what the fuck" and the father comes in. The father, turns on the light and tells him its time for him to know the truth. The father goes through years of data that he collected about this magical world. Blurry pictures, broken wands, weird magical artifacts that don't work and so on. The kid slowly becomes convinced about this. After a long night the two retire for sleep. When the kid wakes, the father is gone.

The whole "evidence" room is clear and the father is gone. The kid then finds clues that the father left behind in case he was ever taken and so begins our adventure.

--------------

I don't know about you, but I would so love to see a muggle in the world of Harry Potter. Using his whits and what not to survive without magic. I think it might be super interesting. What do you guys think?

Anyways more ideas include the kid getting brought in by the government. Saying they have an "anti-magic" task force assembled and his father was one on the cusp of finding out about everything but they did not take him.


** I like it. Try giving this story a read for ideas. It's well written and your idea has some similarities to it

The first several plot arcs of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036071/1/With-Strength-of-Steel-Wings%20With][/With Strength of Steel Wings/]] (W: 719,300; WiP) are like this. The difference being that Harry's still a wizard, and so they eventually use him to try and infiltrate the magical world (since he's the only one who can get past the anti-muggle / pro-wizard barriers).

Somewhere into the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1795399/1/Resonance][/Resonance trilogy/]] (W: 1,713,423; Abandoned), there's a peripheral character that does this. Unfortunately the idea doesn't get explored and featured to its full potential.

#+begin_quote
  What do you guys think?
#+end_quote

I think if done well this can be a great story. Especially since the protagonist himself is a child and doesn't have a powerful patron to be supporting his endeavours. If you decide to write it, please make a new thread linking to the first chapters.

*** Kind of thinking Artemis Fowl meets Tony Stark. Like a very smart kid but he's incredibly cheeky and constantly pokes fun at the magic world (like the newspapers and what not).

I would like for him to be a bit older than a kid, like 15-17 only because it would make sense for him to know certain things I plan on him knowing.

Also having the government involved would be an interesting but complex subplot. I wouldn't want the muggles to have tools that could silence magic or negate it (unless a rogue wizard taught them). I would love a scene of guns versus wands because that would just be fun to witness.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20)

There's a sideplot with a muggle police officer finding out about magic, is obliviated, but she has already written the report on the station's new computer (1993, ye?), so she realizes something is wrong.

Her adventures trying to figure out more about this world is probably the best part of this fic, and she gains more and more scene-time as the story goes on.

As for your idea, I like it - as long as there isn't any mugglewank, the characters are done well and it's paced well enough. I can see a setting like this be quite hard to pull of right.

*** Ok, haha, sorry what is "muggle wank?" This is literally an idea I had last night and I have never even read any fan fic or been to this subreddit.

Yeah, a lot of people told me about that story - I got to check it out. I am thinking the character to be like a cross between Artemis Fowl, Tony Stark and a James Roday Character from Pysch. I want him to be cheeky, smart, cocky and confident. Incredibly likable. Basically constantly cracking jokes but he has the skills to back it up because there really has not been a character like that in the series and I also think he would be super fun to write.

The sole focus would not be on the kid. Probably for the first 1/3 of the book would be just him. Him talking to his father and beginning his investigation would be like the first 2 -5 chapters of the book. He would then meet with the government (i am not sure how, most likely immediately after) because they are curious about this world. I really love the idea of the US government (or UK) having knowledge of wizards but it is some super secret stuff, like only a handful of people know. Think X-Men first class when the guy from the CIA brings the mutants to his base. But I DO NOT want the Humans to have ways to negate magic. That would be too game breaking I feel. Like if they had "silence" grenades or helmets that prevented "Obliviate." That would be way too complex and make the humans too powerful. I mean, they would have obviously a very strong technical advantage and maybe in the inevitable firefight they get a kill or two, but they still get destroyed.

I also would like down the road for the kid to meet a wizard (female) and introduce that kind of love story. For starters, I think it would be really fun to see a muggle impress a wizard with his skills, his tools from the muggle world and what not. It would be fun to see a female wizard who has a certain disdain for the muggle, slowly become infatuated with this world. Like basically you get to see a wizard and a muggle fall in love (akin to Harry Potters Parents). Because you only read about it, in the series, in terms of they are already married. I would like to see it unfold. This would also make for a funny epilogue sequence with the kids.

But honestly, I got like maybe a 1/3 of the story figured out. I have no idea who the villain would be or what would happen after he meets this girl. Would he go to Hogwarts? I am thinking this all takes place before Voldemort and have the "big bad" be some disciple of his who has plans to do something bad (like destroy Hogwarts, Kill Dumbledore, blow up Diagon Alley, etc). That feels a little bit to generic for my taste. I was thinking of introducing maybe a human villain as well. An eccentric rich billionaire who wants to rid the world of magic for his own crazy reasons. I feel that this is where the story goes awry because I want the story to stand on it's own and not really re-introduce characters from Harry Potter's world. But it would be a hell of a lot easier to do so because the world is already there and I wouldn't have to envision a whole other school and what not.

Ok, I am just rambling here - I am not sure if I will ever write this but the ideas are fun.

** It might be fun to have a free-form RPG where the PCs are very rich Muggles in the post-Voldemort Potterverse who got a hold of some preliminary evidence of magic and are trying to learn more about the wizarding world while flying under the proverbial radar. (Very rich, because it means that they can have easy access to things like bodyguards, DNA sequencing, and whatever else they feel like using, /from Muggle world/.)

It'd require the players to be /very/ good at separating player knowledge from character knowledge, though.

** If there was a HP spinoff I would like it to be another magic school story but in another country. In HP almost everything took place in the U.K, just imagine what is going on in the rest of the world....a series of books taking place in the American school of magic, or even Durmstrang would be so amazing.

Thats actually a good point though you brought up. Harry Potter had a very cool feel that would really only work in the UK. I agree that I don't think it would translate well to America.

Very curious to see the world outside of the UK. But it would be very difficult for JK to world build like that given that she has written the wizarding world to have a certain look.
