  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

** linkffn(Behind Blue Eyes) is poorly-paced, riddled with flaws, and badly written at parts.

But the story is relatively entertaining, takes place mostly between fifth/sixth year, and is somewhat canon compliant.

It's a fun story to read once, but isn't really rereadable.
