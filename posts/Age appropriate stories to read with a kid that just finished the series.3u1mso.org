** A lot of the Second Generation fanfiction is kid-appropriate:

[[http://www.jamespotterseries.com/muggle_index.html][James Potter Series]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/Hogwarts-Houses-Divided][Hogwarts Houses Divided]] or linkffn(3979062)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick Series]] or linkffn(3964606)

*Parental Discretion Advised for Alexandra Quick - I'd say 12+

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

*** Thanks for the suggestions. I'm looking at my list of favorites and some other lists and almost every one is either too mature, as in how do you explain to a child that Dumbledore might not be the good guy, or something like Make a Wish where they couldn't possibly be old enough to understand the historical or literature background enough to enjoy it, and it would just be a waste of time to read huge portions of it, or too sexual, even if its subtle, or too gory. Next gen is definitely the way to go, but I really don't read much of it because I'm not generally not looking for stories suitable for a kid =/

Great one-shot, but maybe a bit sad? I thought it was great for bringing the story to a close.

** I mean, by the time you finish the series, it's gotten fairly grim. I'd say anything that's appropriate for 16 and below is fair game at that point.

** Maybe this? linkffn(5677867). Haven't finished it yet. Otherwise Alexandra Quick as mentioned.

#+begin_quote
  The story of "Harry Potter and the HBP", but told from the 3rd person POV of Ginny Weasley. Strictly in-canon. Suitable for anyone whom the "Harry Potter" novels themselves would be suitable for.

** My son's first fanfiction, which he read back when he was nine and finished the series, was linkffn(The Best Seven Years by Blu Taiger), a Calvin and Hobbes crossover.

About this time, he and I conspired to co-write a short and very silly Star Wars crossover (the Omake linked [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/11/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][here]]; warning: the main bit of story, a sequel of sorts to "Sirius gives Harry The Talk," isn't age-appropriate.)

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]]'s stuff is probably largely appropriate, though whether or not your kid would like slice-of-life fluff is another matter.
