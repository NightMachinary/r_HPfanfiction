Yeah the epilogue is suppose to be so mushy, and it's not a big deal, but sometimes listing the names will go on for so long and they're so goofy my eyes almost fall out from rolling. I get it's to pay respects to other people within the story, but when theirs 15 people babies and not a single one is not named after someone else in the group, it gets pretty wild. Overall it's just the epilogue and it might just be the fics I'm reading, I'm not saying I don't want to hear any of those bababy names, but whenever every child is named after someone in the story, the emotion in the whole naming to honor someone is kinda lost, especially if poor and cheesy af.

No. Why? Mushy is bad. I don't think epilogues have to be bad.

It's definitely the fics you're reading. Listings of all the children and other descendants is a terrible way to write an epilogue and only some of the worst fics I've seen had epilogues like that.

definitely.

It's dumb anyway. I don't understand why someone would write that. It's just a very cheap attempt at evoking emotion from the reader. Listing a bunch of names certainly has never worked for me in that regard.

A good epilogue can be a short slice of life, maybe the characters reminiscing about their adventure, a re-framing the events of the story from another perspective (different PoV character) or an entry from a history book of the world.

The Epilogue by JKR was structurally sound. It makes a lot of sense to show a new generation leaving King's Cross and going to Hogwarts. I just hated the content. To her credit she definitely didn't just write out the history of all their families.

Why this inspires authors to take the worst parts from it and just list baby names for two pages and who married whom or became godparents for which children I will never know.

**** For me "mushy" has pretty negative connotations, but I'm not a native english speaker. If you're aiming for "heartfelt" or something like that, then, yeah...
