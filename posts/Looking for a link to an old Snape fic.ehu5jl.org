Hi, I am wondering if anyone has a link to Pigwidgeon37's Sybil's Oracle fic. There is a copy that used to (may still) be hosted on WIKTT but I can't seem to reset my password or set up a new account to access that version.

If anyone had a link to an alternate copy or knows what is happening with the WIKTT site, it would be appreciated!

Thanks!!
