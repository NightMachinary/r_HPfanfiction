A fairly erroneous loophole in the Goblet of Fire's decision making means Harry is catapulted into adulthood far sooner than he is ready for. With it comes the sudden Headship of his family that he is not prepared for.

Particularly the land.

All Noble Houses (of which the Potter family is Ancient & Noble) were granted small fiefdom's by the Queen upon the acquisition of that title. The Potter's are no exception, granted a sizeable island (hidden under careful wards that warp and expand the space within them) allowing the lake and land to be far larger than it would appear from outside.

Newkirk, once upon a time, was one of many magical settlements that were ruled by the Lords of the (would-be) Wizagmot, who they would go to represent at Wizagmot meetings to the Queen and Ministry. The land House Potter governed, complete with it's own subjects, industry, facilities and homes.

Long since abandoned, with the mass migration to Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade after the population plummeted.

Yet despite this: Muggleborns, the disowned and all sorts of non/halt-humans remain unemployed and homeless. These people were those the Potter family swore to protect and have failed to as the family rapidly declined in numbers and influence.

With decades of expectation dropped in his lap, a myriad of properties he has no idea on how to manage and a political career he has not been prepared for: Harry James Potter, Lord of Newkirk has to decide who to trust and who he can use...

...

Not a Dumbledore bashing fic, but I'd like Harry to turn to Dumbledore and realise he may not be quite that helpful. And that the few who DO have knowledge or experience are some of the more snotty Purebloods who've been doing/attempting a similar private community of their own.

I like the idea of most families having sold their land (possibly the Prewits and Weasley's) whilst others have the capital to simply use the abandoned spaces for leisure. And Harry then having to contend with individuals like Umbridge and Fudge who are against his specific brand of humanitarianism (as it doesn't fit their agenda)


** Harry James Potter, Lord of Newkirk, unexperienced and unwilling to invest time into developing his property with Voldemort after him, decides to hire a qualified property manager to handle the decision-making for him. Deciding to go muggle, Harry finds out about a luxury real estate organization. Harry likes the head's go-get-it attitude and hires Donald Trump.

** Would like to see at least one story in which Dumbledore didn't prepare Harry to take over an inherited title because he genuinely doesn't know enough about it to even consider it could be a problem.

Bear with me for a moment. Dumbledore has much in political capital and experience, plus is a big academic, but all of this are things he acquired through his own merits, not through inheritance. It's perfectly logical then that Dumbledore just didn't have any overt experience with nobility and with being the liege of a territory (no, Hogwarts doesn't count, it's a school). All his positions are related to mediating between politicians or being a politician, and his academic success was always related to magic study, so he really could just not know enough to think it could be a problem or that Harry could need any training to it, even more so if almost no one still keeps lordship in the original sense of the word. I can actually see him waving away Newkirk while at most sending someone to keep the buildings in it's state and then never considering it anything more than Harry's future beach house. It's not his job to know details of every wizarding family's history nation-wide.

*** That's exactly what I was thinking. THEN I want Harry to go to him for advice, because he's so wise and worldly, and Dumbledore's advice (what little he can give, after admitting he doesn't have a clue) is more philosophical and far from practical. Leading Harry to have to seek help from elsewhere.

**** Neville (and Draco too for that matter) would be kind of cliche, but maybe Viktor or Fleur -could be a difference between the countries- or someone less used to this, like Bragman, Slughorn or even a portrait of some ancestor of him that dealer with it (Phineas Black or Charles and Dorea Potter maybe?)

***** My initial ideas were:

â–ªï¸Ž Narcissa, manipulating him for her own ends (and, to a much lesser extent) on the instruction of Lucius later on.

â–ªï¸Ž The Delacours, as eventual allies as well as to see how a community functions seperated from its countries Ministry.

And,

â–ªï¸Ž Newt Scamander, as Newkirk is more focused on giving non-human characters (like werewolves) places to live and work, so he'd be a consultant to ensure their individualised needs can be met as more and more flock to Newkirk.

****** Given that Scamander created the werewolf register and seems to deal more with non-sentient creatures, I'm not sure he'd be the guy to call to liaise with sentient magical creatures (used "creature" instead of "being" because being has another meaning in HP I don't remember). In addition, werewolves are cursed humans. Think of them like people with HIV/AIDS. They're human, but with an affliction.

******* I get that, but the Ministry (and the public) very much treat them as if they aren't. Hence why they'd be welcome in Newkirk.

And I just like the idea of Newt understanding their physiological needs (as the lake is filled with merefolk) and I plan on having Harry accommodate species with very specific dietary and environmental needs AS WELL as humans.

******** But hosting someone takes more than simply accommodating physical needs. Otherwise, prison would be a 5 star hotel. I'm not sure someone who created the werewolf register is the best person to consult on this.

****** Maybe a mix of all three? Harry is not idiot enough to trust Narcissa blindly but still needs her experience on dealing with Britain's government and it's nuances, the Dellacours genuinely want to help create a society there but don't have the knowledge of how things are handled in Britain/have too many French prejudices/can't do much because of international politics and Newt is the go-to guy about live-accommodations of the citizens and about how the environment should be, but has little to no knowledge of politics and very little understanding of humanity as a whole. Separated they would create each a hellish landscape or make the project crash and burn almost immediately, but the three together moderated by Harry's sanity and with the magical abilities of Dumbledore form an almost good community.

******* That's what I meant. I'd have Harry effectively cut Narcissa off upon realising Lucius was acting through her (up until a later point when he dies and she and Draco are huntin for sanctuary) whilst the Veela and Newt are a more constant part of Harry's "Council" and help facilitate his ideas.
