Just looking for the story where, because wizards call non-magical folk muggles he decides to call wizards wiggles. I think it also catches on pretty well.


** Great! I came to this site to post a Fic search, and stumble on this thread. I remember reading a story with this, and it was recently aswell, so I went back to Fanfiction.net looked at my favourites, and followings, went through ALL of 2017 and still cant find it, I mass clicked next chapter> Ctrl+F> wiggle for like 30 minutes, and Im giving up! All that I remember clearly about this story is that it was 100k+ words, most likely 200k+ (I tend to read them more) I also remember that the people who start using the term did so almost automatically really, some were quite shocked that it even came out of their mouth the first time. OH and Mcgonagall really didnt like it!

** what next, the hidden muggle world? wonder how they would do that.

hrm... star trek world finds an intact quantum mirror that leads only back and forth to a world of wizards. muggle disease killed all non-wizards. star trek cloaking tech can block magic energy so allows star trek muggles to build secret observation areas.
