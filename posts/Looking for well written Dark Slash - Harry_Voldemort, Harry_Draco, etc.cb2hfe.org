Also very up for fem!Slash, like Hermione/Bellatrix or Hermione/Daphne, etc.

Only stipulation is they have to have good writing and not be full of tropes.

** I just recently read Dark and Twisty on AO3 and I really enjoyed it. It's still ongoing, and has 4 chapters left I think. It involves Harry accidentally bonding himself to “Minister Gaunt”. It's very AU, has some cool stuff with politics and has Harry as a werewolf. Lily and James are alive but have a super strained relationship due to the whole werewolf thing. Linkao3(17826557) Hope you like it

  When Hadrian Potter performed a Dark ritual to become his best self, he wanted to be more magically powerful, stronger, and more intelligent. Instead he bonded himself to the young and handsome Minister of Magic. There's a solution to the problem, of course there is, if only a certain Dark Lord will agree to a breaking spell like any normal wizard would. AU Werewolf!Harry Grey!Harry Tom/Harry SLASH

  Try as she might, Ginny can't make herself stop loving Tom. The knowledge of his true identity doesn't prevent the memories of how wonderful he was from consuming her thoughts.

** For darker Voldemort pairing stories, my favorite authors are Ansketil and ObsidianPen. Their stories typicaly delve more into fascinating possibilities of the horcrux connection and unhealthy relationships.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8988616/1/In-Somno-Veritas][In Somno Veritas]] - Harry/Voldemort story cowritten by Ansketil and ladyoflilacs. In year six, Harry's dreamscape begins to combine with Voldemort's, with unexpected consequences. linkffn(8988616)

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7502151/][No Glory]] - Harry/Voldemort story by ObsidianPen. Rather than kill Harry in the Dark Forest, Voldemort discovers that he is a Horcrux. A darker future for Harry proceeds from there as Voldemort enacts his vision of a brave new world while coming to terms with his human horcrux. linkao3(7502151)

For a (slightly) more fluffy Harry/Voldemort pairing, I recommend:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1356754][The Prison and the Glaive]] series by purplewitch. The starting premise (two enemies locked up together) might sound cliche, but the desolate setting and the evolution of the characters is beautifully written. The first fic in the series is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14368581/][Of Your Making]]. linkao3(14368581)

  The Dark Lord divines what Harry Potter is in the Forbidden Forest, and revelations lead to incomprehensible consequences. Lord Voldemort has won... and the dystopia is damning. A tale of a fallen hero, dark desires, and a Dark Lord's obsession with something he has lost and finds himself unwillingly lusting after: a soul.

  An unexpected twist during the final battle has Harry trapped inside a magical artifact with only his greatest enemy for company. The Carcerem will release them, but the requirement for freedom is an impossible one, for neither Harry Potter nor Tom Riddle will ever forgive the other.
