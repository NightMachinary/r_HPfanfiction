:END:
I am looking for a specific fanfiction where Snape is deaged and sent to live with Sirius and Harry at Grimmauld Place. I think it was Christmas time. And while he was there Sirius abused and neglected him. Later on in the story both Harry and Snape are seeing a psychiatrist and he and Harry mail each other back and forth. I have looked everywhere for it does anyone remember it or does it sound familiar?
