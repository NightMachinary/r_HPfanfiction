So as the title says I thought that The Nice Guys was hilarious, I also really like Midnight Blues, can't wait for the next update. So I was hoping for fics that are similar to both or just one of those things. Thanks for your help.

  After the fall of Voldemort, Harry makes a dumb career choice and Ron tags along. Hermione, sensibly, doesn't. Seven years later, a very different trio are drawn into an international web of intrigue by a little girl and an old relic. Lesson to be learned: stay in school, kids. Post-DH; Slightly AU. Rated M for language and violence. Not slash.
