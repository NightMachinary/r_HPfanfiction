I see fanon characters fall into 2 categories

one is canon characters who have a clear canon characterization but fanon sometimes takes them in a different directiom

Like say lord potter, asshole ron, good guy snape, reformed Draco, hyper competent master minipulator Hermione etc

The other is fleshing out minor characters who were barely mentioned or only name dropped or you really dont know their canon personality.

Like say all the founders, Pansy, Theo, Blaise, Marlene, Frank, Alice, Regulus etc

So who is your favorite and least favorite of each category and why?


** I like fleshed out fanon Pansy who's undeniably selfish and bitchy, but not evil. I would say I like her as a mix of Ginny and fanon Daphne. More relaxed and less proper than Daphne, but more high-class, expensive and choosy than Ginny.

Fanon Theo when he's this quiet, smart student that keeps to himself. But also when he's not overdone on being super tolerant and hating pureblood rhetoric.

Regulus when he's more polite, proper, classy and tempered version of Sirius. I like when Sirius and Regulus are written as more similar than either would like to admit with Sirius being more brash and openly rebellious, while Regulus is more private in that sense and adheres to social expectations, while keeping his critical thinking to himself.

I like fanon Patil twins when they're more than two dumb bimbos. My favorite fanon interpretation of them so far is both of them being Mind Healers.

And as far as canon characters with clear canon characterization go... I'm ok with almost anything as long as it a progressive well-written change and not abrupt ‘personality AU'.

*** I agree 100% with everything you said. Do you have any fic to recommend??

( although I do like Theo and Blaise, depending on who writes them)

*** u/Raesong:

  Daphne Greengrass (not the Ice Queen cliché). There's still more you can do with Daphne even in 2020 onwards.
#+end_quote

I actually have an idea for a different take on Daphne Greengrass that may or may not borrow elements from the backstory of Asuka Langley Soryu, with the goal of setting her up as the primary rival for Harry Potter, possibly with Daphne viewing Harry in a similar manner that Asuka viewed Shinji.

** I like needs-a-hug Draco, strong/confident Harry (not an asshole), nice/polite Remus (didn't really come as such in canon although he was still polite. fanfics make him uber polite and I like that.

from the other kind, I like Justin. he is really rare in fanfics as well. and I only like him if he is a nice hufflepuff in it. cause sometimes he is an ass.

Aberforth as well. very rare.

from Slytherin Blaise.

** I've read a few fanfics that really fleshed out the teachers that i have really enjoyed. With lives and backstories that operate outside of the students and Harry. If well done its fun to read about their interpersonal relationships and how they interact in the teachers lounge. One fanfic i read took the time to give Charity Burbage a backstory and personality. I enjoy a perspective that paints them as more than the 2D view we get from just Harrys perspective.

** My fave is Daphne Greengrass by far, then followed by Astoria, Pansy, Flora, Hestia & Tracey in that order.

I don't have a least favourite really. Maybe Ron.

** "Daphne Greengrass (not the Ice Queen cliché). There's still more you can do with Daphne even in 2020 onwards."

I wish more people would come up with different things with Daphne. Like the way people sometimes write Tracy Davis. Bubbly, outgoing and all that jazz. Just make it Daphne instead. Super short girl, bubbly, a Hufflepuff in Slytherin, short dirty blonde hair with brown eyes.

Edit: I don't know why I can't get the quote thing to work. So, I'll just do quotation marks lol

** Best - Reformed draco for my Dramione. And Daphne... Just 'cause.

Least - there is no one in particular just the evil/jealous (manipulating) characters.

** I've been liking Luna in recent reads, but it all depends on the particular fic. Disliking a character usually means they're badly written.
