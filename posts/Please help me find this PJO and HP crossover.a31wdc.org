So basically, Percy and Harry meet in their dreams. They can see and act in the other's world when one of them is dreaming (or awake if they're both there) and talk through their minds. They become very close, and declare themselves brothers.

They help each other through the books. However, Percy falls into Tartarus, the one place where their communication does not work. Later on, Annabeth and Ginny die.

Harry, bitter and angry, vanishes and returns as the guardian of hogwarts, his identity a secret. Percy sets off to find him. However, he gets captured and only manages to escape years after the 2nd Giant War and The Battle of Hogwarts.

Percy, disguised as a student in Hogwarts, finally finds Harry and they reunite. Another war happens. Harry ends up with Bianca Di Angelo, and Percy, with Hannah Abbot.

Bianca realises that her bond with Harry will never be as strong as that of Harry's and Percy's, but she is content.

PLEASE HELP ME TO FIND THIS CROSSOVER! It is in 2 books. I was pretty sure the 2nd book was 'The Guardian of Hogwarts' or something but I could not find it.

If you guys have read/heard of this crossover, please inform me of it's name or the author. THANK YOU!

(I really hope the author did not delete the account or take it down.)


** Btw, Nemesis is involved in the war in the 2nd book.
