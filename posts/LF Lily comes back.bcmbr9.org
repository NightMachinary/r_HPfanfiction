Hi I've been reading an amazing fic called To Love and Protect. Snape discovers Harry's abuse and mentors him over a summer as this occurs Lily reappears. She then becomes active in Harry's life. Its a great story but I've never ready anything else like it. Nor can I find anything like it. Any recommendations? i don't want a what if she never died or what if her and Snape raised Harry, but a what if the rules change for Snape when Lily returns.?What will she thing of petuna? What will Harry's life be like?


** Harry Potter and the Runestone Path? This story doesn't focus on lily's return or anything but it does happen? That's the only one I can think of really. Good read though!

This fics depiction of GoF is one of my favourites

** This isn't quite it, but if you're interested in the subject of Lily and Snape's relationship and doing things differently, you might want to check out linkffn(Ananke). Lily gets temporarily pulled into the future, when Snape is Headmaster, and she learns about what has happened, then goes back to her own time. And does things differently, with rather mixed results.
