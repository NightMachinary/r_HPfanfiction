** Well, since without Aurors able to come and help her, Umbridge just has a bunch of Slytherin idiots as her muscle while the DA has the support of the teachers (and could easily defeat Umbridge and the Slytherins without help anyway), wouldn't that be a rather short story?

*** Exactly, Umbridge without Ministry support is NOTHING.

** So I don't have exactly what you asked for. But I do want to recommend this really interesting next generation story linkffn(Ignite by Slide) that has the whole quarantined in Hogwarts and teachers fighting from within. One of the few next-gen fics I can stomach reading.

  A mysterious illness leaving a mere handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy.

** Going to go ahead and link linkffn(Under Siege by Dens Serpentis) for a Hogwarts-is-cut-off-and-the-DA-takes-charge story, though it doesn't have the Umbridge aspect.

  7th year fic. Hogwarts is the safest place in the Wizarding World. What happens when its teachers are struck down and it's separated from the rest of the world, leaving the students to fend for themselves? No slash, pairings undecided. No HBP or DH.
