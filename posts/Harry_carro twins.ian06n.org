I just read Twins by Andrius where harry and ron take the carrow twins to the yule ball and it was super adorable. Got major Ram/Rem from Re:zero vibes. It's not a pairing I see often so I was wondering if anyone had any fics of harry with them. Would like to see more fluff like that.[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13491812/1/Twins][Twins by Andrius]]


** not that I can remember. I too really enjoyed this fic though
