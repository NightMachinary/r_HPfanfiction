** I feel the need to challenge some of these.

1.  Eyes are infinitely more complex than bones, so of course it will be more difficult to fix them.

2.  Fair enough.

3.  Enforcing it in any school, especially one the size of Hogwarts would be impractical.

4.  THAT'S NOT HOW TIME TURNERS WORK! FOR THAT TO HAPPEN, THEY'D NEED TO HAVE SURVIVED THE FIRST TIME.

5.  ...

6.  See 4.

7.  When the big man does magic, and the story is confirmed by your Aunt and Uncle, it is legit.

8.  He saw others do it.

9.  The magical world is rather small, so there won't be that many red-haired families.

10. Fair enough.

11. Fair enough.

12. Fair enough.

13. Does Filch really clean the whole castle? /Really?/ I would prefer to think that the castle is mainly self cleaning, with Filch performing maintenance.

14. Ever heard of blood protections?

15. He's a show off, sue him.

16. Permanent sticking charm, b*tch.

*** Eh, the whole "give Harry tons of points" thing is ok for me. In the first book, he does manage to confront Voldemort, and he does protect the stone. Granted, he wouldn't have had to if he hadn't gone. In the second book, both he and Ron did go after Ginny in the Chamber of Secrets. Harry fights off a basilisk (which had been threatening the entire school) and unknowingly destroys a horcrux. Not to mention you could counter argue with Snape. "Huh, Potter is alive. Better take 10 points from Gryffindor."

**** I get that Harry deserves recognition for what he did, but throwing away an entire house's work for the full year just because one person did something amazing doesn't seem really fair. Harry probably should've gotten special services to the school or something, because the entire Slytherin house shouldn't have been punished just because Harry managed to save the stone.

***** Eh they shouldn't have been publicly humiliated but Harry totally deserved the points. In the same way that Gryffindor likely would have won/come very close had Harry, Hermione and Neville not been caught out of bed those 3 plus Ron won it back after essentially losing it for Gryffindor.

****** And then Draco wouldn't have been caught, and Slytherin would still have won. Also, Harry using the cloak (and later the map too) to completely disregard rules goes largely unpunished. I think that Slytherin got shafted and that it was a very damaging thing.

In essence, the point change at the end of the first year sends the message that school rules mean little, and a house-wide effort means nothing compared to a single person willing to throw his house under the bus for his own agendas. Slytherin, who for the past few years were a well-oiled house cup winning machine, suddenly see that Gryffindor is rewarded for Harry Potter, a first year, doing something exceptional (youngest seeker instead of any punishment, house cup instead of punishment). Anyone with any ambition would say "screw the house effort as it means nothing, I want that kind of glory".

I don't disagree with the fact that rules can and should be broken if it means doing something great for everyone. I do disagree with that being the academic standard as set by a headmaster, especially with regard to 11-12 year olds.

****** I don't have an english version of book three (only 1,2,4,5), but my translation basically says "they heard bunch of murmured male voices, then silence and suddenly the unmistakable whirr and muffled impact of an axe". And on "run two" the executioner indeed hits the fence. Although I actually think that sound wise, the movies pumpkins make a bit more sense!

** The Time-Turner ones really bug me. It was stated in canon and on Pottermore that Time-Turners shouldn't be used for even more than a day in the past and you need to be wary about using them for important events. Anyways, we can see from PoA that it's all closed loop time travel anyways.

** I think we can all agree that JK Rowling hadn't thought through some of her ideas. And that's fine. Harry trusting Hagrid, Molly Weasley are acceptable if only because that was a story book for children and Harry is also young with an absurd good streak. Some of the other things are indeed ridiculous wizards game world ideas: forbidden forest, Filch being the caretaker, and many other things not in that link like the third floor corridor, half the teachers being unqualified, lack of syllabus, lack of support structure including counselling, the clearly corrupt government, the discrimination against many citizens and beings. I will say that I did shake my head and disagree with the link in many cases. The one that stuck out for me was the time turner. It doesn't rewrite history. History still moves forward. So if Lily and James Potter are seen dead, it means regardless what you do with a time turner at some point in the recent past, Lily and James Potter will die. This is carefully crafted in book 3 by JK Rowling making sure no one sees Buckbeak die allowing for him to have NOT died when they go back in time. Similarly, Harry saw an amazing patronus and knew that when he goes back in time it will be there at the same time. He doesn't realise that it is his until he is forced by reality to cast one himself.

*** I think that the time turner complaint is still valid, James Potter's body could be a fake. Lily has to die because we already know that Harry survived. History keeps on moving forward but that doesn't mean that things are as they seem. Dumbledore could have, say, gone back and stunned James and created an illusion of him to fight Voldemort. Really, it all depends on how effective conjuration and illusion magic is. Is it realistic enough to fool somebody into thinking it was real. Yes, I do put too much thought into these things.

**** Ok, so this illusion stuff had crossed my mind as well. You're absolutely right in thinking that time turner magic should be based on the concept that facts stay facts, so events occur in the same way in every viewing of the event. This can be therefore, fooled by illusion magic and the fact that what we see may not be fact. At the same time, time turners are rare and so people like Sirius or Hagrid showing up at Godric's Hollow may have used credible magical means to confirm identity and life status before realising that not knowing allows Dumbledore to fix things in a certain way. I wonder if the Fidelius would have messed with that though. But realistically, this is JK Rowling we're thinking of here and she would have never looked this many levels deep.
