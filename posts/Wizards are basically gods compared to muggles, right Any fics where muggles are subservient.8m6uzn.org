#+begin_quote
  Tom Riddle received a thorough education in magic, cultivated an influential following, and secured his immortality. He then disappeared into the Muggle world and was quickly convinced that, left unchecked, Muggles were certain to doom the entire planet. Tom returned a decade later with a careful strategy for world dominion. He succeeded. By the time a young Harry Potter, Heir to his Name and ward of the Malfoy family, is handed a wand at the traditional age of eight, he stands to inherit a modest territory of 25,000 square kilometers and eight thousand restless Muggle subjects.

*** Christianity: God killed with crucifixion.

Norse: Baldr killed by spear/arrow.

Egyptian: Osiris was drowned in a box.

I'm sure there are many more examples. Gods fighting and killing each other with weapons is a common theme.

(Obviously am going to ignore the Muggle vs Wizards bait. That discussion has been done to death.)

***** No, he was always a god. For example he is the brother of Set, the god of the desert, and he descends from Ra.

What you are thinking of is that Osiris became the god of death following his murder.

*** Powerful and influential Muggles IRL have successfully posed as gods to the masses for millennia. Who's to say that a wizard couldn't deliver a more compelling performance? Given that they actually have access to reality-bending powers, they would, at the very least, appear godlike to their followers, and that's all that really matters in the end for said followers to assume subservience. But I'm pretty freaking high right now, so this might just be BS.

**** Deification requires two points: power and uniqueness.

Power is obvious. Demonstrating ability/power/talents that no one else believes possible elevates you in the minds of the masses. Its especially easy to do this when the population is fairly ignorant: the "god-kings" in the ancient world often made astronomical predictions (ex. eclipses) which they used to prove there divinity. People worship what they cannot understand or do themselves.

Uniqueness is harder to understand. Its one thing to create fire and wow the ignorant. But what if there is another guy who comes up and does the same? Not so special anymore. What about hundreds, or thousands as is the case in the HP universe? When Moses tries to prove his divine empowerment, he transforms his staff to a snake. In response the Egyptian priests do the same thing, not to prove that it cannot be done, but that it is not exclusive to them.

A more appropriate analogy would be that wizards/witches would be seen in a similar manner to the elves or dwarves in Middle-Earth. Men know they exist, know they have powers beyond them, but they do not worship them. There are multiple reasons for this, but the most important are there are a lot of them and they can die/be killed.
