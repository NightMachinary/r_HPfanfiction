I usually try to write them up just to get them out of my head, but never share them. Though I really don't want to write anything but focus on my story at the moment. Currently I'm imagining Fawkes being owned but some semi-friendly wizard hermit, then poofing to Ollivander to give him two more feathers and Ollivander saying 'oh god not again.'


** I write them up as a prologue/snippet, and usually post them here and in the HP threads.

**** Yeah. I've got a number of those snippets.

"Returned, Extremely Dangerous" - Grindelwald has changed during his imprisonment, grown remorseful and accepted his punishment, but when he hears about Albus's death, he decides to break out and save Britain from Voldemort (and redeem himself in the process). The rest of Europe is shaking in their dragon-hide boots, expecting him to resume his conquest. And his old comrades, called to his banner once again, have a little trouble adjusting to the new policies.

"Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider" - Petunia never married. She studied archeology, and, being a squib instead of a muggle, works both for universities and Gringotts, exploring tombs warded against muggles. And raised her nephew well until he receives his Hogwarts letter.

"Puzzle Pieces" - Ronald "Ron" Wesley, member of MI5, thinks his new assignment, observing a possibly endangered scientist, Hermione Granger, with his partner (and future brother in law) Harry Potter, is routine. Until she spots the two of them and blurts out their names - but neither of them has ever met her before.

"The Return of the Boy-Who-Lived". Harry has been raised by Sirius, Remus and Albus, and trained to face Voldemort since he was little. Now he is sent to Hogwarts, to gain some experience with others of his age - and to protect the students and staff in case there's a Death Eater attack. After all, none there have his training, and some students getting saved by Dumbledore after stumbling into a group of Death Eaters infiltrating the Ministry hardly makes them skilled fighters. Hermione, Ron, Neville, Luna, Ginny and Lavender have dealt with problems and Death Eater plots since first year. After Voldemort's return was revealed at the end of the last school year in the Battle of the Ministry, they are preparing for yet another year of danger and plots. And they'll have to protect the Boy-Who-Lived as well, who is apparently coming to Hogwarts. Lacking their experience fighting Death Eaters, they expect him to be a spoiled, pampered boy.

** I write them out too and then leave them in a file where they'll never see the light of day. It's the quickest way that I know of to get ideas I'm really not interested in pursuing seriously out of my head.

** I write them down. Sometimes they develop, sometimes they don't. I have one that I started writing down on my phone while waiting in line at a Barenaked Ladies concert about three years ago. It's morphed from third person to first person and I think about it every now and then and poke at it some more, but it hasn't developed much.

Sometimes I'll incorporate little bits I've written into a larger piece. My HDD is littered with bits and bobs, some of which are over 10 years old. Right now I'm working on finishing up a multi-chapter that I /think/ has one chapter left to go and a one-shot birthday fic for a friend. I've written down a few scenes for an Auror Teddy story and another one-shot that was inspired by a post here.

I've started using the Scrivener app and I like it a lot. You can have a master document with sub-documents and it has a handy place for notes and research and everything is saved as one file. It encourages me to make more notes on thoughts I've had so when I go back to the piece I'm not like, "What the fuck is this shit?". Well, maybe not /as/ WTF. I can have scenes as different sub documents with their own notes sections and I feel like it's really helped me get away from my seat-of-the-pantsness.

**** [[http://literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview][It's a powerful piece of writing software.]] I don't often pay for software--I'm on a Mac and had previously been using Pages and I bitch and moan when iPad apps cost more than a dollar--but I ponied up for this real quick after using the free trial for a couple of days. I'm only scratching the surface of what it can do the way I use it. One of the things I like the best is the name generator!

** Stored away in my gdocs Like, I wrote something like 300k words in 2017, and only published maybe 60k of them - the rest are all plot bunnies and snippets that are just going to languish there. Occasionally, if something was developed enough, I'll post it to my ffn misc document.
