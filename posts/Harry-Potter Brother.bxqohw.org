Hello! I wanted to see if more people could give me insight on how one of the most cliche plot in history is by my ideas if that makes sense? My book, Secrets Of Magic, is an AU where Harry was born in 1979 (same birthday) and his baby brother was born in 1980. The prophecy was changed to fit all three boys (brother, Harry and Neville) instead of just two, Harry's brother is in the esteemed Hufflepuff house and Hermione is no longer female but male (also in Hufflepuff) so what do you say? Give it a go?
