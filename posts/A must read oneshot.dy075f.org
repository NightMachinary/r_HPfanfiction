This story on wattpad, is a fremione oneshot, and I love it. Find it [[https://www.wattpad.com/myworks/205892244-sleeping-beauty-a-fremione-oneshot][here]]. It's a must-read, do vote for the story on wattpad, and tell me in the comments what you think! Here's the short description of the story.

/Hermione Granger finds Fred Weasley lying, apparently unconcious, in a deserted corridor, with Draco Malfoy and his two cronies standing around him. What could they have possibly have done to Fred? Would this incident reveal more things than intended?/

Plz tell me what you think of the story in the comments.

P.S: To those concerned. This story is written by my cousin, and this account is shared by me and her, and I posted thi post, which is why there is some confusion that maybe I am 'leading you guys to believe that someone else wrote this fanfic when actually I wrote this', blah blah.... anyway, I dunno if it's against the rules of truth and dare to tell u guys this, but sharing the story on my cousin's reddit was a dare by my friend Emilia. Thanks. :)


** You're leading us to believe that you loved a story from someone else, when what's really happening is you wrote the story and want votes. You need to be upfront about that.

*** This account is shared by my cousin and me, and this story was written by my cousin. I am sorry if that created some confusion, but I didn't write this story, she did. Thanks. :) P.S: I dunno if it's against the game rules to tell, but sharing the story on my cousin's reddit was actually a dare. :)
