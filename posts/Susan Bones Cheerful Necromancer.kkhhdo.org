One might think that the 5th year Hufflepuff girls dormitory would be the last place one would find one of the most powerful dark rituals known or unknown to the magical world. One would be correct in their impression... most of the time.

Susan Bones was the very picture of Hufflepuff ideals. She was generous, a hard worker, and absolutely loyal to her friends. Susan loves gossiping with her dorm mates, watching her house quidditch team, and stressing over whether the boy she likes noticed her new haircut. She is also attempting to resurrect Hannah Abbott's recently deceased pet bunny.

As far back as her family's records show, the Bones family have always been necromancers, and always been Hufflepuffs. From the very first Lord o' Bones, who threatened to wipe out the entirety of magical Britain, the secret knowledge of the Bones Family Necronomicon has passed from head to heir through countless generations.

Most people wouldn't expect such purveyors of dark arts to reside within the halls of the 'Puffs, but oh how wrong they were. Necromancy was hard work; it requires years of training, dedication and absolute focus. As for Loyalty? Well, who could value loyalty more than the master of an army of mindless, undead thralls? Susan Bones was the ideal Hufflepuff, and she was proud of it.

  “No. I think she might study her own family Grimoires. The Bones family might pick up a few members that way.” He took a sip. “Perhaps not. Their family magic was a type of Necromancy. Magic of the dead. Illegal, though not for her, if she uses Family Magic.”

  Arcturus Black, in failing health, receives a vision of the Black Family Progenitor, Caderyn. TheProgenitor has a plan. If followed, it will strengthen the Family Black for a millennium. Arcturus also learns the true meaning of Toujours Pur. He calls together the remaining family, except for Sirius, a group of elderly women. Arcturus desires to see Harry Potter before he dies. This summer, when Harry goes to Diagon Alley to purchase his Hogwarts supplies, will be the perfect opportunity.

** I'm getting a Mrs. Cake vibe, here. "The church, the Ministry and popular sentiment all said that communing with the dead was vilest blasphemy. The Bones family have long held that it was, on the contrary, no more than common courtesy. Just because someone had passed beyond the veil was no reason not to stay in touch."

**** Mrs Cake is a minor character in Discworld. They're able to talk with the dead and also have precognitive powers (which they can switch on and off). Mrs Cake rents out rooms to those who aren't human so that they have a place to stay, especially those who are related to being not-quite-living. They occasionally help out at temples (when they aren't barred from entering) and generally take care of the place in accordance with the temple laws...except for the whole talking to the dead thing (which is why they get kicked out a lot).

** In one universe, Death's granddaughter is a governess who is sheltered from her grandpa by her parents. In another, she was a witch. In the Bones' family, Death was a friend of the family.

'AGAIN?'

'Death...' Susan looked up at the hooded skeleton with her best attempt at puppy-eyes. 'Binky is such a sweet rabbit! And just look at Hannah, she's heartbroken!'

Death sighted like the rustle of dried leaves on graves.

'ALRIGHT. WE'LL PLAY FOR IT.'

'YAY!!'

'AND NO CHESS,' he warned her.

'But no sacrifice needed either, right?'

'NO. BINKY HAS LITTLE IMPACT ON THE FATE OF THE WORLD.'

In the end, they settled on Colonists' dice game. Susan made tea so strong it could, metaphorically at least, raise the dead, took some time out to comfort her friend and won the game.

With a slight stutter, Binky came to life.

'It's a shame you have you lose him,' she said.

'YES.'

Then, hesistantly: 'TELL YOUR FRIEND I'LL TAKE GOOD CARE OF HIM WHEN HE RETURNS.'

Death faded away. 'THANKS FOR THE TEA,' she heard faintly.

'No problem,' she told the thin air.

** As it turns out, the Peverells were true masters of Necromancy as well - but their greatest masterpiece was attaining eternal life through death - Lichdom. Horcruxes were mere scraps from the true heritage of the Peverells. The Potters had inherited this heritage, but preferred to not publicize it like the Bones. However, there was still an allegiance between the two Houses of Death.

...This absolutely leads to nowhere since Harry doesn't give a fuck about his Peverell heritage, he couldn't care less about his Potter Heritage either. He does love his Grandfather's Sleekeazy money tho.

*** Nice. I'd love to see a story that starts like this but with Harry slowly realizing how important (and comforting?)the Old Alliances are as he slowly learns all of the respective family magic provided by his unique bloodline.

Something like he slowly turns into less himself and more Lord Potter-Peverell-Black or something. Maybe the addition of Slytherin Family Magic gained from right of conquest in defeating Voldemort in three separate fights he started makes him more like himself.

Idk, seems pretty cool

**** Part of me also wants to see Susan at least flirting with Harry, maybe like the idea of a Potter-Peverell/Bones marriage having been something that the families have joked about for a millennia but have considered forbidden because of what such a union would be capable of, and now with ol' Tommy Boy there's a legit debate as to whether it could be worth it to risk the future repercussions of kids drunk with the power of both immortality and armies of undead servants (or at least a few powerful bodyguards... maybe a squib of the Bones family who had studied their necronomicon travelled to Europe and took the name Frankenstein)?
