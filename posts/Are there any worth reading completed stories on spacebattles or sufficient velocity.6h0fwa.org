I encountered recommendations but every single one is about just starting quest/story or something long abandoned.

I am interested in wide variety of stories - without tragically stupid the things like OOC, bashing, idiot ball etc.


** Strictly HP? I haven't seen any worth reading that are solely on there and uploaded nowhere else.

*** Crossovers are ok, if truly great nonhp stories are also ok as bonus.

**** If you're familiar with Naruto then [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/sasuke-uchiha-and-the-power-of-lies-naruto-comedy-au.472801/][Sasuke Uchiha and the Power of Lies]] is absolutely fantastic. It's by the same guy who did the Seventh Horcrux.

**** blood and chaos is pretty amazing; its buffyverese and its kinda a cross between milo natural 20 and hpmor(except with end goal of gaining power compared to uplifting humanity)

** There was or is one HP crossover with Worm(the current spacebattles fandom) about a Harry that has Dementor-Rogue(xmen) type power going on.

He absorbs their soul(or something, it hasnt been clarified) and gets their powers(if they had any). He is posing as a "good guy" while Dementor Kissing useful parahumans for their abilities.

Incredibly slow updating almost to the point of abandonment.

Another quirky story in the same crossover setting has Harry being transported to the Worm universe by Voldemort at the end of the Goblet Tournament because he knows the prophecy and the best way to deal with it is sending Harry away with corrected(by Voldemort) school material so the mediocre person that is Harry can survive and not die in a week.

This one harry is friends with Grues sister and they started selling Cheering Charmed lemon juice to people.

Both havent been updated in a month I think so I cant remember the names. Stupid authors.
