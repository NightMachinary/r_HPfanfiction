rules: no harry <-> tom/voldemort, ginny <-> voldemort. I am looking for body swap fic, preferably between different gender, but not a requirement. The more people swapped the merrier.

Luna does not feel comfortable in her body so she convinces Harry to switch body with her for a week. Its Harry/Luna genderbent full of fluff and very interesting. Post-war I think. I enjoyed it. Hope you do as well
