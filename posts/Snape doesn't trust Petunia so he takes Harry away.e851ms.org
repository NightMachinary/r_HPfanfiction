Snape remembers from his childhood that Petunia hated all things Lily and doesn't trust Dumbledores belief that they are family so she will care for him. Instead he takes Harry away amd either raises him or takes him somewhere else.


** linkao3(the meaning of mistletoe by Endrina) has this exact premise! The first story is heartwarming and adorable. If you continue reading you are in for a wild ride but it's worth it! I loved the whole thing.
