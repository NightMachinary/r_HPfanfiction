i'm looking for fics that are either centered around Luna or feature her heavily, preferably darker stuff. no graphic noncon or underage stuff; violence/dark magic is fine. lighter or crack-y fics are welcome if they're well-written.

  After one taunt too many by Draco & learning of dark things while possessed, Harry refuses to play his part anymore. Into this comes Luna with her own dark story to tell. They shall both get revenge and shake magical Britain before the end. - Harry/Multi

** Reading A Little Lunacy by BellonaBellatrix is like a trip to wonderland, a free ticket to Luna's head. It's a Tom/Luna story that surprisingly made sense dynamic-wise. Dark themes ahead, tho.

  All good plans go awry sometimes. Luna can attest to that. Her first year was a strange one, and Luna decides to take matters into her own hands. In her sixth, she sees too much and pays the price. TRLL

** **** I really enjoyed this Druna. It does briefly touch on rape when she is taken by DEs, but not graphically that I recall.
