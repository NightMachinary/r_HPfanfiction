I've been searching for bad HP fanfiction to read for fun, and I've been coming across a LOT of "Harry comes into his inheritance" stories. It /is/ something that could be interesting if done in the right way, but there are SO many fics that begin the exact same way.

- Harry is about to turn 15/16/17,
- He has a flashback to when he happened to overhear Ron and Hermione talking to Dumbledore about how they're getting paid to be Harry's friend.
- At midnight he goes through /a change./
- He then immediately gets a letter from Gringotts about his inheritance, and portkeys to the bank.
- Seven drops of blood onto a parchment/ in a bowl
- List of Harry's parents, ridiculous number of lordships and heirships, all the blocks put on his magic/ love potions to Ginny/hate spells towards Voldemort.

There are dozens of these. I'm sure you guys all know this, but I was kind of amazed. Why do they all start the same way? Is there some famous fic that all these originated from? Or does it come from some sort of collective consciousness?

If you've got 'em, I'd love some recs for your favorite inheritance test fics, good or bad!


** The first instance I remember of the "At midnight he goes through a change" trope is Ruskbyte's /The Order of The Phoenix/, back in 2002.

The inheritance thing and the Gringott's test were massively popularized by /HP & The Power of Time/ by Rosswrock in 2007. The whole story was basically tropes in fic form.

Dumbledore stealing Harry's money and love potions were likewise massively popularized by jbern's /Bungle in the Jungle/.

The blocks on magic thing, I *think* might have been first used by some dude named Fyar Warning (or something, he's since changed his profile name and I can't find him). He had a very popular story about Harry reaching Dumbledore's/Voldemort's level very quickly and playing both sides against the middle. I think it would maybe still stand up to this day, due to the writing style being unusually good.

The trip to Gringrotts was iconic in Full Pensieve's HP & The Years of Rebellion. It was full of delicious, delicious drama, I still remember parts of it.

The lordship thing I can't think of right now. I think it was an evolution of the "Heir of Gryffindor" thing, that a lot of old fics used at one time.

Note that, a lot of the above suffer from the Seinfeld effect - less well known stories might have used the tropes before, but the above stories were a lot more popular.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

**** Jbern's Bungle in the jungle is a lot of fun. Since a lot of HP fanfiction blends together in my head I don't remember the specifics, I just remember that I enjoyed it a lot. Some stories don't age well though. Mileage may vary.

** Thinking about it, the idea of an inheritance test in the wizarding world is not really silly and is a reasonable idea, the only thing is that in 95% of fics it's absolutely over the top and like you said, leads to 10 different lordships and more money than you can spend in a million lifetimes.

But done right, I think that it can be a good plot point.

** [[/u/T0lias][u/T0lias]] went through them better than I could, but I would like to add that I feel like a lot of the bashing tropes became codified by Reptilia28's "Don't Fear the Reaper" challenge, which had dozens of stories written for it, the earliest in 2008.

Even though it's a time travel plot with Soulmate!Hermione and doesn't explicitly mention any of the above tropes, it usually results in the sudden power boost, Thief!Dumbledore, and Love Potion!Ginny, and often the other ones, too.

** Maybe it's time that some sort of chronological record of the detailed etymology of fanfiction be worked on. If it has can someone give me links? (yes, I've googled it. All I've found so far is very general term/broad brush rough history and often inaccurate).

** I think being able to magic potion up your family tree is totally cool, but I also think it's more of a novelty item than something you can take to the bank.
