So, I've read linkao3(The Devil's White Knight) and would like to read same idea, where Harry suddenly goes in other demention or time line is changed, but he has old memories. Harry suddenly have lover/fiance/spouse he didn't expected, and, well, confused at first. (I think I read something similar, where Harry thought he was in other world, but it was artifact which changed his memories, and that goes too.)

I prefer slash, so that would be awesome, and it doesn't have to be a masterpiece. I hope there's something.


** This is the closest i can think of linkffn(4080247)

#+begin_quote
  When Harry wakes up in an alternate timeline--a timeline where Voldemort was defeated long before the first war--he discovers everything is different. His parents, his godfather, his friends--and him. Harry must deal with the consequences of who he would have been if he had been raised by his parents, and figure out where he stands with his casual hook up, Draco Malfoy.

  One good turn always deserves another. Apparently. Epilogue compliant/AU. HPDM slash but some canon het along the way. Please trust me - I promise the epilogue will not bite you.
