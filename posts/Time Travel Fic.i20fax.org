:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for a fic where the following people go in time: Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Draco, and Astoria. I would like them to go to their 1st year, or in Ginny and Astoria's case, pre Hogwarts. If anyone has a good fic suggestion, pls tell me! Thanks in advance!


** This one has most of those people (missing Ron and Ginny, you get George instead). linkao3(25071553)

  Things in the future got so fucked up. After the mess with Ginny Weasley and the diary, the girl housed a shade of Voldemort's soul. And thus, ended up helping bring him back, start another war, and a bunch of other shit. - This isn't that story. This is the story of what happened to the good guys and heroes after the villains executed them by throwing them into the veil.  (Unfinished. Hopefully, one day, will be completed.)

** This sounds like something I would love to read! But alas, haven't found anything similar. I do remember some fic about Harry, Ron, Ginny, Hermione, Neville and Luna going back in time to the Golden Trio's first year. I don't remember the name, but could probably find it if it is something that might interest you.

​

Cheers!

** This was the first page in a google keyword search, if it's right?

If you put something in quotations in google, it'll give you only results with those words exactly. I did each of those names in individual quotes, as well as “Fanfic Time” without quotes.

  When Draco Malfoy misses his weekly probation meeting Auror Harry Potter and his partner Ron Weasley agree to quietly look into it. What they discover at his home will send them and their wives on a mission through time. After all the only reason Draco Malfoy would go back in time would be for evil purposes... Right?
