Perhaps Lily's protection responded to the soul sliver with a hard no.

Any good fics where Harry never plays host to a piece of Voldemort's soul?


** The Horcrux latched onto the nearest living thing instead, the Potter's cat. A Ministry employees inspecting the house afterwards adopted it, a kind-hearted lady who loved cats and colour pink.

  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.
