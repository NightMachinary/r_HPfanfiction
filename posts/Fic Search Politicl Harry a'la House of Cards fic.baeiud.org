HI, I'm trying to locate a short fic (5-6 chapters if I remember correctly) that dealt with Harry in politics. What was in it:

- Harry came back to UK after some time and got shafted during the elections and didn't got the department he wanted, instead he got educational department

- he was sleeping with Demelza or Romilda who was a reporter

- he was using his department to undermine the current minister

This fic is basically House of Cards in Potter robes, but I just can't find it. Anyone knows anything? :)


** Does Harry break the fourth wall to explain his moves to the reader?

Can't have House of Cards without it.
