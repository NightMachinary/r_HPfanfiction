I know this may sound really crazy, but hear me out. I recently came across *[[https://www.inverse.com/article/23769-newt-scamander-tom-riddle-harry-potter-fantastic-beasts-alternate][this article]]* where, surprisingly to me at least, Eddie Redmayne had auditioned to play young Tom Riddle Jr before Redmayne had landed the role of Newt Scamander. This really peaked my interest of the idea. I highly doubt that there are any fics like this, but if there are anything with this idea, please point out the fic to me. Other than that, I guess I would like to challenge any writer to take this idea and makes something out of it. It could even be a one shot.

*** Now I'm just imagining Riddle escapades around the world where he documents how he pulled off particularly spectacular murder sprees. Someone needs to write this, lmao

**** Well, now I'm considering doing a crackish one-shot on this sometime this week. I've not come across this before, heh.

*** Is "Do" really the best you can do? How about "How to Commit Them"? Or "Perform"? "Do" /is/ a bit bland, I think.
