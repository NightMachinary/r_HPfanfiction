Redemption/character development? A big contrast for interesting plots?


** Snamione is definitely...something I was confused about until I read some fanfiction.

I think the draw for me to it is that they are equally matched as far as intelligence goes. I feel that they would have been able to have stimulating conversations and even teach each other something. - I feel this has been affirmed for me through fics.

Again, she's so, gentle and he is not. I like that she kind of has the ability to make people listen and I suppose maybe it's sort of a beauty and the beast sort of feeling (gosh that's funny though cuz you know...the actress did play Belle... but I've been shipping them since before that.)

The fics I've read, he does sort of redeem himself as far as after the war, you know, people do write him as someone who is incredibly guilty and full of self-hatred for the mistakes he's made. As far as for during the war, I understand people do not agree with his treatment of Harry though, I find that through the help of Hermione in a lot of these fics, that she tends to sort of bring them together in at least some kind of understanding. As far as the student/teacher thing...I shamefully have a thing for that, but I always read them where they end up together after she is of age. The age gap thing does not bother me, as I am also in an age gap relationship.

I guess...most people hate this ship so defending it for me is hard (being someone who can't properly explain themselves, thanks to the ADHD brain!)

*** Wow, thanks for the reply!

I definitely agree with you that they are both intelligent, though I think Hermione has more book-smart where Draco has more wit. I picture that they might be able to work on something together post-Hogwarts, like if they seek jobs in the Ministry. The only problem I have is that I'm not sure if Hermione can forgive Draco, let alone develop a relationship more than friendship with him. In canon she consider morality to be extremely important in a person, basically hates anything dark or anyone that's dark. Consider how much Death Eaters have damaged her life (she had to Oblivite her parents, her friends died fighting them, and herself got tortured), I am not sure how far Draco has to go to redeem himself, until she sees him as a different person. Especially consider Voldemort is now gone, there probably isn't enough chance to prove himself. Still, I can see the possibility if the author can put up a interesting plot, like getting him to help capture other death eaters in the hiding. It's wonderful to have a new insight on this pairing! Is there any work you have read and particularly liked?

**** I actually see Hermione as the one who would have the easiest time forgiving DE's out of Golden Trio. She's suffered ofc and made sacrifices but she didn't really have any deeply personal loses unlike Harry and Ron, Fred and Remus probably being the closest to it. Aside from Bellatrix there was also never anyone attacking her (or her family) personally. She was the one who always argued a presumption of innocence for Snape against Harry&Ron and encouraged them to ignore Malfoy. All that combined with having a proof that DE's can change in Snape and Regulus, I don't see it as impossible for her to forgive some of them (esp if it's well-written).

***** Really, really agree with you. Also think that she'd understand the power dynamics of those things (like they were kids taught something wrong and then told they had to abide by it ~or else~, like I have a hard time imagining they weren't told their parents would be punished/killed/tortured if they didn't fall in line) and try to fight for like mental healthcare for kids raised in that and for them to have a second chance before dismissing them all as just as evil as their parents

** I've really enjoyed Dramione for a few years, but haven't read any of the others. For me, it's the draw of a relationship where two characters challenge each other and learn from each other. For the most part, I believe that Hermione, forever the champion of those that are taken advantage of, would have a heart for someone like Draco post-war. He obviously was under a lot of pressure in sixth year and, in my reading of the series, wasn't just letting death eaters into the castle and trying to kill Dumbledore for the fun of it. The scene in the books where Harry runs into an emotional and overwhelmed Draco in the bathroom speaks a lot to that imo, especially considering the trouble he had ultimately going through with it. I think anyone pressured into such awful things at 16/17/18 has been pretty awfully manipulated and traumatized. Compared to Harry and esp. Ron, Hermione had a few more traumatizing experiences and was fighting a cause that would have been more morally damaging to her. I see big potential for her and Draco bonding over being forced into a fight that wasn't their own, for their likely similar alienation from their families or the shared feeling of needing to fight for or do awful things to defend their families (esp. assuming Draco's family was threatened to get him to do his sixth year tasks, implicitly or explicitly), shared intellectual pursuits (often times, though not necessarily canonically, he's painted as well-read or studied in a particular area of magic, like potions) and for a mutual attraction based on things they can learn from each other (wizarding customs or a loving family structure or traditional/old magicks or even just confidence or self-acceptance).

I kind of just went on way more of a tangent than I expected to, so shoot me questions if you have any or if I really didn't make sense.

** Snape is a hard no for me because we get enough insights into his mind and I honestly find him to be one of the most repulsive characters there is.

Malfoy, I can envision a few plots which would not be too unbelievable, but they would result in a very different Malfoy compared to his canon characterisation and you would need to diverge before year 2. Afterwards, way too much water under the bridge. Certainly by year 3 where he spends the entire term trying to get an innocent creature executed for his own incompetence and the joy he takes from Hagrid's suffering. As far as I know, there are no such stories, or at least none which do not whitewash Lucius and Snape along the way, something which would be too unbelievable for me. The only way would be him taking one look at Hermione's scores and then stalking her the next year to see how that mudblood is cheating. Only, she isn't. Slowly, he questions blood supremacy. By year 5, you could turn it into a romance. However, Draco would not suddenly be friends with the Weasleys, and neither would any other Death Eater.

Bellatrix is only viable if you diverge before she kills Sirius. Harry thrown into the 70s like in Passageways works without any problem in that regard (although I dislike the OP Harry aspects of that fic). You can sell it without time travel as a pretty unhealthy relationship (Bellatrix is 29 years older than Harry, 28 to Hermione), but again, she must defect before the DoM battle. The best way to handle her would be a defection after the break-out and her then playing a crucial role during years 5 and 6.

Preferably Harry, Hermione, Bellatrix, Sirius, Andromeda and Nymphadora doing their own Order equivalent because Bellatrix does not want to go back to Azkaban, no matter what. They go death eater hunting. They take care of Umbridge. Maybe they deal with the Ministry in general. And over two or three years, there is enough time to slowly turn a shaky comradery into a friendship into a relationship.

** I think it's the ”forbidden fruit” aspect that's attracting people to it, it's not expected, it's probably not even possible in the HP universe, but it'll happen just because people are attracted to the forbidden, for example: the third floor corridor in first year..

**** For me its like a Prince and a commoner, so if you like the Disney Princesses, I associate it with that. Opposites attract etc

Most fics I read that is Dramione are either post-Hogwarts where Draco tried to redeem himself or time travel. I have some recommendations if you're open to it?

** Great question, for the first time in my shipping career I'm actually having to analyse my Hermione/older man ship preference haha! (I mainly ship her with Severus or Remus.)

I think for me Hermione is a character that I just can't see settling for someone who doesn't challenge her intellectually and I feel both Remus/Severus could manage to do that quite easily. With Severus, I think the reason I always like to ship her with him is that it sort of fleshes out the character a bit better.. I know the book goes into a lot of detail about him and his backstory but I feel like there is so much of him that goes untouched and unexplained..... reading scenes in fanfics that talk about Snape in his spare time, between lessons, in the middle of the night... I just find it fascinating. Maybe it's the fixer in me, I just want to see the damn man happy!
