"What are all the Spells we'll learn in this class" or "What are all the spells we need for OWL and NEWT" and asking someone (Not Snape) for the Potions that will be learned too. If he has a Flat list of "This is everything a 7th year would know" and learns all the practicals, then the Tournament would be a lot easier for him. The "Teachers can't help" Thing wouldn't apply as it's asking for Class Stuff. Just Harry with a bit of sense and learning to catch up with everyone.

Also works for post 1st year where Harry realises "Fuck, Voldemort is still out there and after me specifically, I'd better learn hard" rather than "YAY QUIDDITCH LET'S PUT OFF VOLDEMORT TIL THE LAST MINUTE!"

Also works for... just any time at the start if you have a more excited Harry. "YAY I'M LEARNING MAGIC" rather than him getting into the monotony of it like the Wizard raised were. Harry should have been to practicals as Hermione was to Theory and Revision. (He had some signs of that between 3rd year where he learned a spell a lot of adults cant cast, and the DA)


** This is a fun story, from what I recall. He gets his shit together to actually give some effort a couple months in. Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10192722/1/Overheard-Conversation]])

#+begin_quote
  Harry overhears a conversation between two of his teachers early into the first year at Hogwarts. What he hears makes him ponder about how he's going about his school work. He decides to take action and make his parents proud of his performance. Just how will that little change influence the events taking place at the school?
