This could be fun. Exactly what the title says, find a disturbing fic and link it here and I'll respond once I've read it. I'll try to read as many as I can.


** linkao3(4356347) should be fairly disgusting, but more because of the picture it paints of the author rather than the content.

I also believe I remember someone saying that Fem Harry gets knocked up by Aragog in The Rise of the Meretrix.

  Harry Potter is not like other boys. He's not even like other wizards. Everyone thinks they know the real Harry, but they're wrong. He has a secret even his friends Ron and Hermione don't know about, a secrets that he fears they would never understand or accept about him. But he may have found someone who understands and accepts him completely; someone who shares his secret. (AU)
