#+begin_quote
  sight of the dead bodies,
#+end_quote

I'd use 'dead children' he's already just seen two bodies.

#+begin_quote
  their deaths were for the Greater Good
#+end_quote

Get rid of that.

#+begin_quote
  Dark Lord's demise because of the intense longing feeling his tatoo was giving off.
#+end_quote

The mark fading is canon, I'd just keep to this unless you have a reason for changing it.

#+begin_quote
  He was certain she had told him that the names of their children.
#+end_quote

He knows one of these kids is the child of prophesy but can't remember their names?

Unnecessary use of full names here. You can drop the twins middle name later if you want.

#+begin_quote
  No longer smiling, Dumbledore suddenly recalled the event that initiated all of this. He could still hear the eerie words spoken by Sybill Trelawney.
#+end_quote

Suddenly recalled that did he? We've all read the books, don't need to hear the prophesy again in Dumbledores thoughts.

#+begin_quote
  The Killing Curse as its name suggests, kills. Infact, it could be considered the perfect spell in a twisted way.
#+end_quote

I've read the books, don't need to be told this.

#+begin_quote
  Legilimens!" he shouted
#+end_quote

Dumbledore doesn't shout.

#+begin_quote
  Using passive legilimency, Dumbledore assured himself that of that it wasn't originating from the child, but it was still coming from his direction.
#+end_quote

I'd just cut this. Passive legilimency is almost always a mark of bad fanfiction.

Using legilmency on the horcrux and it working? Why wouldn't Dumbledore just take all Voldemorts secrets from Harry's head? If this is only for purpose of diagnosis than do something else.

#+begin_quote
  normal Dark Lord.
#+end_quote

Dark Lords are so common they are stereotypes.

Nevermind the fact the power for powers sake is probably the most common reason people would use dark magic.

#+begin_quote
  Its for the Greater Good, Dumbledore reassured himself.
#+end_quote

Stop saying greater good, and stop fucking capitalizing it.

#+begin_quote
  Hell, if not for his sister's death
#+end_quote

Dumbledore doesn't speak this way. Even in his mind.

--------------

Okay I skipped to the last bit. I like the idea of this fic, but I wouldn't continue reading. You're either doing a manipulative!Dumbledore fic or you have a poor grasp on the canon character either way I'm unlikely to follow this. This whole chapter is probably unnecessary in any case. I'd just ditch it and have the the story start later on and explain things as the story progresses.

** If it's an interesting read, I'd be willing to beta. I haven't been able to sign up as an official beta on ffn because I haven't had the nerve to post anything yet....

**** Definitely within my wheelhouse. I've only read the first few paragraphs, but I'll finish the first read through in a bit. Fairly well written so far, I think I've seen one grammar error / badly formed sentence. The only critique I have is word repetition. Shall I send you a PM so we can share emails?

**** I think people have already given some great advice. I think your characterization is off, that isn't Dumbledore, and that you're trying too hard. Fledgling scar, ancient wizard, premature corpses... It reads as if you're trying to up your word count and jam in flowery language to impress. It's bloated. As to the plot, what makes it original? There's tons of stories like this, so what will set it apart?

*** Agree. I feel the same way. If it is in my wheelhouse, I would also beta. I haven't touched my own works for years (muse, where are you?) but you can see my work on fanficauthors.net.

Give us pairings and general plot so we have an idea if we can help.
