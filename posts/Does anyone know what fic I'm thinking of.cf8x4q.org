:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I can't for the life of me remember the name but it was essentially that the Horcrux in Harry's scar gains it's own consciousnesses and Harry calls it Tom, before the Philosopher's Stone. It was long ago but I don't think Harry was OP in this fic, cause otherwise I probably wouldn't have been that interested in it. Last I read, Harry had chose not to destroy Riddle's diary and instead keeps it in his trunk with a rather ominous ending that it wasn't all that safe. It's driving me mad and I hope that someone here has read or heard of it


** Linkffn(The Memento) although the sequel whuch contains years 4 and on has been on unofficial hiatus since March

*** That's one of my favorite fics, but there's no sentient horcrux in it, and Riddle's diary hasn't made an appearance. Maybe you were thinking of a different one?

Edit: From your description it looks liked you meant [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11762850/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Accidental-Horcrux][Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux]] and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12278649/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Chrysalis][Harry Potter and the Chrysalis]]. linkffn(11762850; 12278649)

  Until he befriends a grass snake in his aunt's garden Harry believes his relatives when they say there is no such thing as magic. Looking for a place to belong, he ventures into an elusive world shackled by age-old prejudices and fear of a man who may or may not be his father. What he finds is more than he expected, but less than he hoped. First Year AU
