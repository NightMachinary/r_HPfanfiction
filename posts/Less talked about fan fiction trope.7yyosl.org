So something I've noticed throughout many, many pics is that flitwick seems to fall out of his chair a lot. Do part goblins have problems sitting in chairs? Or does flit wick just like falling out of his chair?

Edit: so this was kinda meant to be a joke. Like not at all serious.


** I wouldn't call it a trope. Tropes tend to transcend a single universe.

But to answer your question, it's just an extrapolation of an event that occurred in Sorcerer's Stone. Flitwick was doing the class register, got to Harry's name and, presumably because he got excited, fell off of the stack of books atop his chair that he was using to see above his desk.

** I read one story (don't remember the title) in which Flitwick did it at some point in the first class every year, just to make himself seem less intimidating to the students.

** You might want to start by reading the books.

Flitwick falls off his chair when reading attendance in HP first charms class when Flitwick gets to Harry's name.

*** True, but it's like Dumbledore and Sherbet Lemon Drops. Yes, it happens in the books, but only /once/, and it's kind of a weird thing for fanfiction writers to have latched onto in particular.

It's like they went: "Wait... what's Flitwick's characterization, again? Let's check his first appearance, those are usually good... ah, he falls of his chair. Uh... okay. So Flitwick is the guy who falls of his chair all the time, I guess? Blah, too lazy to read beyond the first sentence. Let's go with that."
