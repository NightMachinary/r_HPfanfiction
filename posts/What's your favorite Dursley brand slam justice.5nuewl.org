You know what I'm talking about, probably - most fics include some character close to Harry discovering the abuse. Said person apparates there immediately, fit to be tied, and The Dursleys Get Punished. I've read some creative ones... in one fic I read, they made the Dursleys very claustrophobic, unable to taste food, and irrationally afraid of the dark.

I have to admit that it's one of my favorite tropes. Usually, it's unnecessary for the story as a whole, but I rub my hands together like a gleeful cockroach anyway. Feed me, pls.


** I just have to recommend "Seventh Horcrux", linkffn(10677106), again.

This time, the Dursleys had the misfortune of getting Harrymort into the house, and they suffered mightily as a result:

/It started small as I relearned the art of wandless magic. Forget to feed little Harry and Dudley's bottle explodes. Insult him and your tongue starts to swell up. Go ahead, lock him in a cupboard. He will always find his way out, and you will somehow find your way in./

/Even misfortunes that could not possibly be my fault, such as Vernon's demotion at work, were attributed to my malice. I, of course, never argued against anything that made me seem more powerful./

/The Dursleys eventually decided that they feared my dark presence more than Dumbledore's threats. They dropped me off at the orphanage, the firehouse, and deep in the wilderness. They even called Child Protective Services on themselves. Repeatedly. Yet I was always back by morning./

...

/Thick as they were, the Dursleys eventually realized that the only way to live unharmed was to accommodate my desires. It was the childhood I had always dreamed of./

...

/I stroked the parchment of my Hogwarts letter with fondness./

/The youngest Dursley nearly wet himself at the deranged smile on my face. That was an expression usually reserved for our little "chats" (These usually involved quite a bit more screaming than chatting. Still, I always healed him at the end, so it's not like he has anything to complain about)./

/My "loving" relatives were more than happy to ship me off to Hogwarts where I would be far, far away from them. The desire was mutual. Even with training, the three were barely tolerable./

** I just love the wording on this one - it's spoken by an OC:

“I've already taken the time to ruin their lives,” he admitted. “Vernon Dursley is currently in jail for financial crimes. Since Lord Potter didn't want his circumstances revealed to the world at large --- I took a different path in punishing them. Petunia has developed a case of kleptomania. In a matter of weeks, she's going to get caught and when they investigate the Muggle police are going to find at least a hundred thousand pounds in stolen goods. Right now, the charm work is letting her get away with it --- but that part will wear off and she'll get caught. It's going to be /amazing/.”

Minerva grinned at him. “You were always one of my favorites even if you were in Ravenclaw.”

***** She has also said she is taking a break until 2018. Entirely her right but she lists whining and entitlement as reasons, so she really doesn't seem to have a filter for dealing with the internet.

Her site actively blocks copy/paste so a workaround plugin is required for offline saving.

Her policing of fics is borderline absurd, actively insulting people who try to give constructive criticism and being rude towards people who want to extend an excerpt of hers.

As an author she is a great but as a person we would be enemies. I can't confirm any rumors but an .epub file of the story you mentioned might be floating around. You would have to PM me if you want to research the topic.

At least she unlocked her site so everyone can read. And the taking a break only applies the the HP fandom, so I have high hopes for more Sentinels of Atlantis.

** I prefer that they're punished with their own transgressions.

Vernon loses all sense of taste making all food bland and boring. He starts negotiating bad deals and his work-related contact network unravels when his customers leave. He gets demoted at work and loses the company car. Dudley starts painting happy trees and goes to ballet school, and then moves in with Cedric, or Celine as she now calls herself after the operation (no offense, but it'll be a /nightmare/ for Vernon). For obvious reasons they never have children of their own, but Dudley keeps borrowing the neighbourhood's young boys. The police find that very interesting.

Petunia becomes the center of gossip. The garden starts to wilt, and she can't seem to clean the windows properly. She's no longer invited to tea by the other gossipers after that time when she sneeze-farted. It was a smelly one, too. A strange affliction makes her half deaf and unable to whisper or talk quietly. She then gets a bad case of vocal Tourette's Syndrome after she accidentally brains herself when a /soapy frying pan/ slips out of her hands. She manages to offend the entire Little Whinging in just a week. The police starts to investigate how she ended up with a strange child, and what really happened when her sister disappeared all those years ago.

Dudley gets thoroughly beaten up after Mark Evans learns karate. Dudley's entire gang deserts him and starts hanging out with Mark instead. They soon lose interest in the new game "Dudley-hunting", because he's too fat to run away, so there's no thrill of the chase. He gets blamed and arrested for everything wrong anyone else does. He fails all his exams and is sent to St Brutus's Secure Centre for Incurably Criminal Boys. Aunt Marge disowns him after he accidentally stumbles over Ripper. Then Ripper chases him up a tree which he's unable to climb because he's too fat. Mark's gang watches the entire embarrassing incident. Mark has a camera. Mark is vindictive.

** Not sure if it's the one mentioned by OP but the marriage stone on ffnet (sorry on mobile, I'll try remember to come back later and add links) is similar. Personally, my favourite ones are where Dudley and or petunia, in the absence of Vernon, are able to reform. A good example of this type is seen in 'a year like none other' by Aspen in the sunlight on ao3.

*** Yep, that's likely it. It was a long time ago that I read it, but that part stuck with me in particular.

I've read fics where they reform, and they are almost as satisfying. Dudley was as much a victim of circumstance as Harry. Environment has a huge impact on character and views, especially in formative years. Anyway, thank you for the rec! I'll look into it.

All of Petunia's spite, Vernon's anger, and Dudley's petty brutishness are still going to be there after Harry leaves. They will all just find new targets. I don't think anyone could make them more unhappy than they make themselves.

It was another Independent!Harry plot.

Lord Hadrian James Potter, wearing his House Ring on his left hand, enchanted robes on his body, shrunken trunk and broomstick hanging from a necklace around his neck, strode out of his bedroom at the Dursleys for the last time.

As he approached the front door, the sun just rising, Harry suddenly turned around.

Quietly humming to himself, he drew his wand. It wouldn't hurt to.../pay back/ the Dursleys for the years they had neglected him now, would it?

Harry's wand waved through the air, heedless of the now-absent Trace, and magic /happened/.

Below his feet, the carpet leading to the door was suddenly tracked with stains, mud and wine and something disturbingly yellow.

The cupboards in the kitchen slid and swung open without a sound; food scraps from the nearby rubbish bin flew out and stuck themselves to every plate, with dribbles of juice and milk re-pouring themselves into every glass.

Another wand wave, and dust bunnies appeared out of nowhere, soiling the floor, the walls, the curtains, the photos on the table, with a thin layer of dust. Spiders flew out from the cupboard under the stairs and scattered themselves throughout the house, weaving their webs in every corner and behind every couch.

Petals from Aunt Petunia's pot plants scattered themselves across the benchtops. Bird poop splattered itself against the windows. Toys and games were unpacked and left lying everywhere. A thousand weeds sprung up in the garden outside.

Harry lowered his wand, and smirked before stepping out and quietly shutting the door.

/Lets see how THEY enjoy doing all the housework for a change,/ he thought to himself.

As an afterthought, the Boy-Who-Lived let himself into Vernon's car and covered the floor with mud and grass, before he finally Apparated away from Privet Drive forever.
