In cannon, Olivander's wands cost 7 galleons. JKR's conversion is 1 galleon = 5 pounds. This means that Ron's family is unable to spend 35 quid to buy him a new wand (and wands are, of course, the most important thing a wizard owns).

This seems ridiculous to me. I could buy Ron using an old wand more if they were actually super expensive, or if he wanted to use Charlie's wang for another reason, like perhaps he idolizes his older brother.

What do you think is a more appropriate price for a top of the line wand from Ollivanders? 200 galleons (£1000), 500 galleons (£2500)? How about wands from lesser wandmakers? Perhaps 75 galleons or 50 galleons?

Edit: Upon further reflection, and several people pointing out that my knowledge of when Ron's wand was damaged in Chamber of Secrets, I have decided that a big part of this post (ie Ron's family not buying him a new wand) is flawed. Since Ron's wand wasn't damaged until /after/ they flew the car into the Willow, we can assume that, even as it was a hand-me-down, it worked for Ron just fine during his first year.

After royally pissing off Molly and almost costing Arthur his job, Ron was too ashamed to ask for a replacement from his parents or older brothers, and his hold-ups with his family's relative poverty meant he wouldn't ask Harry (plus it's weird for a teenage boy to ask his peer to buy him something, in my personal experience).

After the year is over, Ron's parents are more than happy to drop 35 g's on a new wand for ya' homeboy Ron.

Also, I quite like [[/u/Noexit007]]'s headcanon that the ministry subsidizes wand production. It makes sense that they'd want to keep their society thriving, and pushing this absurd cost of entry onto incoming muggleborns would be a deterrent.

*** The timeline is still kind of wonky if you think too hard.

For example, Lily and James died on the evening of Oct 31, and Vernon saw wizards celebrating You-Know-Who's defeat on the morning of Nov 1. Harry doesn't get dumped on the Dursley's front step until the evening of Nov 1, and doesn't get picked up with the milk bottles by Petunia until the morning of Nov 2. What the hell was going on with Harry in the ~30 hours? Did Dumbledore feed him or change him? Because he had no problems with leaving a baby on a doorstep during a winter night, lol.

Another example is Tom Riddle's horcrux timeline. He has 5 horcruxes done by the age of 25, and was planning to make 6 in total for a 7-part soul. He was going to use Harry's death for his next one... at age 50?!

*/July 1995/*

Voldemort settled into the Malfoy Manor. He finally had a body of his own for the first time in fourteen years. There were so many things he missed, one of which was being able to hold his own wand. But he felt like something was missing...

"Hmm, I've got a half-dozen loyal servants in prison. They could be useful. Maybe I'll let them out... oh, look, house elf room service! They even have the expensive spicy grain mustard, my favourite!"

  “How come he's stopped killing people?” Harry asked. He knew Voldemort had murdered more than once in the last year alone. 

  “Because he doesn't want to draw attention to himself,” said Sirius. “It would be dangerous for him. His comeback didn't come off quite the way he wanted it to, you see. He messed it up.” 

  “Or rather, you messed it up for him,” said Lupin, with a satisfied smile. 

  “How?” Harry asked, perplexed. 

  “You weren't supposed to survive!” said Sirius. “Nobody apart from his Death Eaters was supposed to know he'd come back. But you survived to bear witness.” 

  “And the very last person he wanted alerted to his return the moment he got back was Dumbledore,” said Lupin. “And you made sure Dumbledore knew at once.”

Dumbledore was aware of Bryce's murder and the uptick of other suspicious goings on. I'm pretty sure Harry's disappearance and murder combined with the escape of Moody/Barty Crouch Jr. would have been enough to support the conclusion Voldemort returned. After that it was only a matter of time before Voldemort made enough noise to make it unimpeachable.

I do agree with you, but I'm just saying that if Voldemort really wanted to start his second rise to power in the shadows there were better ways to do it then abducting Harry and murdering him in a very conspicuous way.

** JKR's money and pricing is whack all over the place, not just Ollivander's wands. For example a wand is 7 galleons, but Hagrid says the unicorn hairs he finds in the Forest are worth 10 galleons at market, which is why Slughorn gets all greedy over them. Ollivander's wands are all handmade, with hand collected and carved wood, so he's losing lots of money... unless he's subsidized by the government as a necessary public service or something.

Another example of whack pricing is Fred and George charging 7 sickles for a canary cream, a handmade enchanted item they invented themselves, and probably is individually made rather than mass produced. At the conversion rate, 7 sickles = ~£2. TWO BLOODY POUNDS?! I guess it's an okay price when targeting the student market, but how are they making money to afford to stock and fit a Diagon Alley store?

I keep seeing this point but it's not really fully through through.

Firstly, we know Ollivander collects his own materials, he doesn't buy them. So the cost to a consumer of those materials isn't really relevant.

Secondly, if Ollivander did buy his materials, he would be a trade buyer. You could make a similar point with regards to many things in the Muggle world: compare the price of a McDonald's burger with the cost of going to the supermarket and making an equivalent burger yourself. It's more expensive to a consumer to make it themselves, but that doesn't mean that McDonalds is losing money. It means that McDonalds has access to lower prices than consumers do.

**** But why would Ollivander use the unicorn hairs he collects to make wands if he can just sell them on the market and get more money than he would get for a finished wand? It's like people in Soviet countries feeding their farm animals with bread because it was government subsidized and cheaper than the grain it was made from.

Besides, wandmaking is presented as an incredibly complex craft that only a handful of people are competent in in the entire world, so it just doesn't make sense that finished wands are even remotely in the same price class as the raw materials they are made from.

Even if unicorn wands cost 13 galleons (so you can't just make money by snapping wands and then selling the unicorn hair for more money than you originally paid) it's still one or two magnitudes off from what one might expect as a price for a wand.

It's like expecting 2kg of steel to cost about as much as an intricate sword created with a secret technique known to only ten smiths in the entire world that took several days to forge. That's just complete bullshit and absolutely not how economics work.

** Well my headcanon has always been that because wands were such an integral part to the Wizarding world, allowing witches and wizards to learn magic in a controlled and proper manner (obviously quite important to the success of the world), that the reason the wands were so cheap is that it was simply a processing fee, and the real cost was covered by the Ministry or local wizarding governments.

So in other words, the wand itself might cost 1000 galleons, (Perhaps 600 in materials, 300 in labor, 100 profit), but the government covers the cost as part of its services, and you simply pay a transaction fee to the seller for their time/energy during the sale.

Think of it as taxes covering a "basic fee or service". And let's be honest, that's kind of how important Wands are in the Wizarding world.

Of course, this is just my headcanon. Long ago I planned out a fan fiction that had a more detailed explanation of this in it, but then I had some real life health troubles and writing was put on the back burner and it never happened. But if anyone wants to borrow the idea (I don't even know if its original), go right ahead.

Imagine volunteering to compete in the Tri-Wizard Tournament, literally risking your life multiple times, for a grand prize of 5000 pounds. That same amount of money is also a sizable enough investment to make a person a 1/3 owner of a successful small business. Wands should probably be 1000 pounds or more, but I also wouldn't be against seeing the purchase of a person's first wand being at least partially subsidized by the Ministry which could substantially reduce the price.

The average class size at Hogwarts is between sixty and one hundred, so even at the thousand pound price tag, he's making a maximum of one hundred thousand pounds a year.

**** We all know that Rowling wasn't great with numbers. But for both you and [[/u/themackattack90][u/themackattack90]], consider the other end of the spectrum, specifically for the Triwizard Tournament. The size of the wizarding economy is presumably much smaller. The fact that most wizards can magically produce 90% of their basic needs already makes money less of a necessity, especially in a world when objects can last for lifetimes. So smaller amounts can go a much longer way. And I doubt Rowling took this into account, but the value of the 5000 pounds in 1994 would be nearly doubled today due to inflation.

Also, prizes for kids competitions don't really stretch up into 250,000 pounds, especially for something with such a small pool of potential participants. On the other hand, something on the order of $10000 or 2000 galleons is reasonable for both prize money. If you look at prize money from business/startup competitions, those tend to be in the $5000 to $10000 dollar range (ergo it's not a crazy amount if you're aiming to startup a small business). Something like the International Math Olympiad gives basically no direct monetary prizes. Highest prize money I can find from a quick search is ~45k from the Howard Scripps spelling bee. And from what we saw of the actual tasks, the threat of serious damage was generally overblown and facing down a dragon, especially if you go with the common fanon interpretation of trained dragon handlers staying in the area, is probably safer than playing football or Quidditch.

** Maybe I'm missing something here (as an American), but if it's 1 galleon = 5 pounds, that's 1 galleon = $6.56 USD. So, a wand is 35 pounds, or $45.93 USD, which is kind of expensive. I mean, considering it's for a witch or wizard's MOST ESSENTIAL TOOL EVER, I can absolutely see how that seems pretty cheap. But with 7 kids so far, 3 of them already in school at the time and also needing new supplies, that can be a strain on a one-person income.

Now, consider I calculated this in 2018 money. I don't know how JK did it. But converting 2018 money into 1991 money, that ~ $46 wand is roughly $25. Sounds a lot cheaper, but we have to remember that the rate of pay back then likely reflects this.

So while I can see that being 'cheap' for a wand, I can also see how the Weasleys could be stretched too thin to manage it at the time - especially with still another kid to put through school, and one that can't rely fully on hand-me-down clothes.

The real question here is "why didn't Charlie the dragon tamer or Bill the curse-breaker lend a bit of money to their family to help out?"

*** By the time of the first book, 2 of their kids were out of the house, Ginny was still homeschooled with Molly, and Ron was given a secondhand wand, which was Charlie's first. So I guess the Weasleys don't really care about the quality of the MOST ESSENTIAL TOOL as long as everyone has one.

Whenever the Weasleys' poverty and inability to afford school supplies is brought up, I always wonder why they can't use magic for things like clothes, which don't break Gamp's Laws to create or modify. Even if they aren't able to conjure robes from nothing, surely they can transfigure old robes into new ones so they don't look secondhand (which Draco notices and comments on). Or maybe they can buy a single new set of robes, then duplicate them so all their children can wear new clothes for the start of the year.

The Weasleys' poverty is basically an unintentional implication that Molly and Arthur suck at magic. But that's contradicted by the fact that Arthur can enchant a flying car, which seems like pretty advanced magic... but if he's not using his advanced skills to transfigure school supplies and clothes for his family, then that's an implication that he doesn't care how they dress or present themselves in public, lol. No wonder Percy left and Draco thinks Ron was born in a bin.

I know that it's a plot device/authorial contrivance to characterise the Weasleys as humble, endearing, and relatable to First Year Harry, but it still bugs me to heck.

**** This is a good point, all of it. I suppose when it comes down to it, they figure that any wand is better than no wand.. However...it just occurred to me how little the Weasleys SHOULD need to purchase each year. It seems like the vast majority of it should be able to be passed down - the robes (once the current boy grows out of them), the hats, gloves (maybe), they should be able to share 1 or 2 telescopes, since none of them have Astronomy on the same nights or at least at the same times, and pretty much everything but the DADA books should stay the same yearly. Standard Book of Spells, Grade ___ can be passed down, etc etc.

Also, it's noted that Molly has the time (or magical skill) and money to knit every Weasley PLUS Harry a Christmas sweater, so she IS capable of making clothes...she just doesn't, except for the holidays. Why not knit more or, like you said, modify a lot of stuff?

I doubt duplicating them would work - I feel like there has to be some type of charm or law in place to prevent it, or clothing stores would go out of business if you could just buy a few things and then duplicate and modify them. However, that wouldn't stop Molly from making her own stuff by hand and duplicating THAT...

That leads us to your ' unintentional implication that Molly and Arthur suck at magic', but like you said..Arthur enchanted a dang car! And let's not forget Molly clearly does several spells to wash, dry, fold, move, cook, etc throughout the series, and she killed Bellatrix! So she can't be too shabby, either!

The one thing I could think of that could possibly explain Ron's wand is that maybe it's not a well known fact that a wand that doesn't choose you won't work as well? After all, Ollivander mentioned it to Harry - but then, that's Harry Potter. Maybe it's not a thing that gets told to everyone? It doesn't excuse the shabby clothes and such, but it at least could explain that one thing.

Add in: as far as we all know, didn't Ginny get her own wand the next year? I don't recall any mentions that hers was a hand-me-down. If so, that really SUCKS, and makes me think of how the locket Horcrux called Ron 'least loved by a mother who wanted a daughter'.

Another thought - why on Earth could Charlie even abandon that wand? If the wand chooses the wizard, and that was Charlie's match, what reason did he have to give it up? I don't remember any mention of wands compatibility changing for people the way their Patronuses (Patroni?) could..

Now I'm just rambling and overthinking!

**** Magic just creates so many problems and we're all here scrabbling to try and solve them. =)

If going to Hogwarts, on top of the supplies required, needs a tuition then it makes more sense that the Weasleys are poor. Arthur's a department head, makes a pretty good salary, but has to pay tuition for seven kids for seven years at this super prestigious school.

As for transfiguring robes, perhaps it can be done, but transfiguration is difficult and making a robe that looks modern and tailored is out of most people's depth. Maybe Molly is good enough to patch holes and lengthen/shorten the robes to a good approximate size, but it's still not runway quality.

You want runway quality, you go to Malkin. She tailors the robes to you and maybe even adds in some neat warming charms or something.

So the Weasleys only have to pay for the uniforms, books, and equipment. It's a once a year expense, and it makes them look bad at budgeting (and extremely irresponsible) when Molly opens the Weasley vault for the yearly Diagon Alley shopping trip, and there's only sickles and knuts.

In the 90's a newspaper cost around 0.75 cents which is between 50p and 60p depending on the rate of conversion. If we use 50p, this would mean a knut is worth 10p. There are 493 knuts in a galleon meaning a gallon is worth around £49.30. So it would seem £50 a galleon is more accurate than £5.

** I'm a little chary of attempts to make the wizarding economy make sense: leaving out of account the fact that their currency is denominated in prime numbers and they've handed over control of their currency to a hostile foreign power, the fact that they've all got magic means that their economy is at least partly post-scarcity. The use of money is more like its origins, as a means of settling ritual 'debts' that can't be settled with goods or services. At the same time, their money has to function well enough as modern money that they can buy stuff from the muggle world that their magic can't make for them. Food being the obvious one - it being an exception to Gamp's Law, after all.

Ollivander's 7-galleon price tag really only has to cover his grocery bill, and £35 in 1991 wasn't much less than a weekly family supermarket shop. If Ollivander can shift fifty wands a year, he's in eating money, and can use his magic for the rest. He doubtless sells accessories too - polishing kits, holsters, whatever - and they'll contribute a bit, too.

The price point of a first wand - we never see anyone go in for a replacement - may well have been set at a magically-significant number rather than anything to do with mundane economics. If you break your first wand, it may well be that you get charged a more economically-sensible price, if only to express his disapproval of you not taking better care of one of his creations.
