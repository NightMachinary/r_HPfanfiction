** The True Half-Blood prince by likdrummetboi. It's a wip but the author is working on multiple stories so what happens is the author will write a few chapters for this story and post them all together day after day then leave the story for a few months.

  While Magical Britain may be content to ignore warnings of Dark Lords the ICW takes such threats much more seriously. They dispatch an investigator to look into the claims, and what he finds will shake the bedrock of the Magical World.
