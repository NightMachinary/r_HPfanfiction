:END:
Everyone is playing pranks on Umbridge and blaming Harry, I think he might be trying not to get arrested? It also might be a time travel fic, I'm not sure.

Edit:

Thanks so much [[/u/Erebus199]]! That's the one I was looking for.


** Sorry, I don't know. =/

But, you're the first person to use the renamed "What's That Fic?" flair and, honestly, I'm loving the hell out of it. Great idea, [[/u/thrawnca]].

** linkffn(Courage and Cunning) is what you're looking for. Still WIP, but the writer remain alive and activeish so it will /probably/ get finished at some point. Enjoy.

The scenes you refer to are in the later-middle parts of it.

#+begin_quote
  Salazar Slytherin has had enough of Dumbledore and Voldemort's stupidity, so on October 31, 1981 he decides to put a stop to the wizarding war. Things do not go according to plan. He loses his memories, but 10 years later he regains them when he gets a familiar letter. Bashing of some characters at first, but it gets better. A twist to the Harry is Salazar genre. More inside...
