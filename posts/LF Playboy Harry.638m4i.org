Looking for a Harry Potter that's confident in himself and can bring witty remarks towards girls that try and flirt with him instead of just blushing.

  The stress from the Triwizard Tournament was building up. Harry just hoped that the Yule Ball and his date with Lavender Brown might alleviate some of it. Lemons. Harry/Multi. Hermione, Cho, Fleur, Lavender, Susan, Hannah and possibly more.

  After the defeat of Lord Voldemort, Harry Potter finds himself being even more famous than he was before. Returning to Hogwarts for the finally time, there doesn't seem to be an end to the amount of beautiful girls who want to physically thank him. This is an Adult alternative-timeline Book 8, filled what-ifs and hook-ups. Strong sexual content and language.

  Privet Drive is home to many secrets, many lies... And many sexually frustrated women. As Harry Potter soon finds out. AU Fifth Year, HP/HG/NT/Various, rated for general naughtiness. R&R
