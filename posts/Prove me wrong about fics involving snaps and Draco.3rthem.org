** For me you're right about Allen Rickman, his voice definitely is a major factor in why I like snamione. Although I do think there's room within canon for redeeming him.

Draco though, I see him as someone who was indoctrinated to believe certain things, and who eventually realizes that (in sixth year in canon). It just makes me want to see him offered a path out of the terrible situation he's in. It reminds me a lot of how I was raised strictly Catholic and slightly racist, yet I've managed to shed most of that. I like to see fics that explore the toll it has taken on him to do so. Breaking with his family, stress from the internal conflict between what he's always known and what he sees and feels himself.

Then I like to see him come out allright on the other end, and I want to help him get there. But I can't since he's a fictional character, so I'm okay with Hermione (the character I identify most with) doing that instead.

Tom Felton at the age he was in the movies was not my type, though he looks good now, that didn't influence my opinion about Draco, the books did. In fact, the development of Draco's character beyond just a bully is the only thing I liked about the last two books

Since you asked for an example, here you go: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3187054/1/For-You-Always-For-You]] . It is a tragedy and takes place after HBP. Even without the additional book with multiple signs of Draco not being happy with where his family has been pushim him, it makes for an emotional read about his situation.

** For a large number of fans, Rickman is only barely relevant; I personally don't care for his portrayal. Or for the movies, period. The version of Snape in the books is infinitely more interesting and complex to me.

I can offer you a scattering of fic recs, and I'll mark the pairings to give you a heads-up on whether they're m/m, m/f, or gen. Of course, not everyone can agree on what constitutes a good version of Snape, so we'll see whether or not your taste coincides with mine.

The Boy Who Lived is about Harry, Snape, and Dumbledore, and why Harry named his second son after them. It contains Snape/Dumbledore, but that's not the subject of the fic, although their relationship holds up a concise, startling mirror to their narrative purpose. The ending, which shows us Harry with his baby son, is deeply moving.

linkao3(The Boy Who Lived by Delphi)

"Though I do not wish to wish these things" is a story of intertwined relationships, emotions, and memories amongst Snape, McGonagall, and Rufus Scrimgeour, centering around Scrimgeour as a prisoner of the Death Eaters, with Snape as his jailer. Snape/McG, Scrimgeour/McG.

Night-blooming heartsease develops a relationship between Snape and Neville, told from Neville's POV. Written early in canon, so completely AU. Try this one even if only out of curiosity. It takes place during the war, and it's energetic, beautifully written, smart, and moving. A fandom classic, actually.

linkao3(Night-blooming heartsease by julad)

Mutability is a persuasive, intelligent, incredibly well-written portrait of a very bleak Snape, self-controlled and very nearly beyond caring. Voldemort orders him to seduce Minerva, and it almost - /almost/ - brings a flicker of humanity to his arid soul. Snape/McGonagall.

linkao3(Mutability by kelly_chambliss)

Those children's voices - a short Snape/Lily fic that is not romantic, not redemptive, not pretty, but is poetically and harshly convincing. Written in 2006, so not DH-compliant.

To Dwell on Dreams depicts a Snape addicted to a potion that allows him to hallucinate a phantom Lily. But the potion will obviously kill him if he doesn't stop, so Dumbledore locks him in a tower room and forces him to endure withdrawal. Harrowing, incredibly vivid, sympathetic yet unsentimental. A great psychological portrait of Snape.

linkao3(To Dwell on Dreams by musamihi)

Penultimate Acts is another character study, this time of Snape during his year as headmaster. It's quiet, sharp, cool, fair, and a little bit heartbreaking.

linkao3(Penultimate Acts by pasi)

Match Point (Unforgiven) takes place mostly in Azkaban, as a chess game between an incarcerated Snape and Remus Lupin, whose testimony put him there. Their conversation reveals the real stakes at play, and flashbacks give a glimpse of a years-long, passionate, angry relationship. Major character death. Snape/Lupin.

linkao3(Match Point (Unforgiven) by snegurochka)

The Sin in Your Grin (and the Shape of Your Mouth) is primarily a portrait of Sirius, his pessimism and recklessness, and the intermittent hate-sex he has with Snape. It alternates between the first and second Voldemort wars, and it's got a fantastic, /noir/-like atmosphere.

linkao3(The Sin in Your Grin (and the Shape of Your Mouth) by xylodemon)

And although it's a bit narcissistic of me, I'll include a gen piece I wrote as a character study, which could also be described as pre-slash but doesn't stray too far in that direction. It starts with Eileen Prince Snape receiving a visit from Harry Potter after the war, which pulls her memories and opinions about her dead son to the surface.

Sorry, I can't help you with Draco fic because he doesn't interest me very much.

  Snape swooped around the room like a giant bat, adding ingredients to some cauldrons and stirring others. Then he stopped and tapped his wand against the benchtop impatiently. "Well? What is so important that I must risk a vital brew of Animaserum by having you in the room with it?"His tongue was so dry, he didn't know how he would ever get the words out. "Heartsease, Professor." There, that wasn't so hard. He took a deep breath. Dementors were worse, surely.

      This is a prequel to Transfigurations, begun as a birthday present to Resonant, at least two birthdays ago\. Best laid plans, etc\. This departs from canon when Transfigurations does, after PoA, and I've tried to avoid using anything from the later books\. Massive thanks to Resonant, Cesca and particularly Mia, who fought for the story she believed in\.Please note: There's a quote at the start of the story, and it's there to serve as a gentle reminder for those who've read Transfigurations, and a warning for those who haven't\.

  Severus thought he'd already imagined every possible order the Dark Lord could give him. He was wrong. Set at the end of GoF.

      Written for the Snapecase fest on LiveJournal\.  My thanks to my expert beta readers, Moira of the Mountain \(aka Mountain Moira\) and The Real Snape\.The first line of the story comes from Goblet of Fire; the rest is mine, though of course the characters are JKR's; I make no claims to her empire\.

  Lupin pays Snape one final visit on the night of Snape's execution.~9,000 words. NC-17. Major character death. Multiple chess metaphors. Written for the 2005 Snupin Santa exchange. Thanks to Smoke for the beta work. November 2005.

  #+begin_example
      Written for Rex Luscus at the 2005 Snupin Santa exchange on LJ, who asked for Darkfic for the following scenario: Snape has been sentenced to be executed for the murder of Dumbledore and other war crimes\. Lupin goes to bid him a very conflicted farewell\. Take in any direction you want, though sex is highly encouraged\. Caveat: no happy endings, sentence being commuted, last\-minute rescue, etc\. Snape really must die \(though not necessarily on\-screen\)\.
    The white prison cell, and the chess, is obviously inspired by a similar scene between Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart in the film X\-Men 2\. Used as an added homage to Rexluscus, who I know is an X\-Men fan\. :\)The epigraph \(epitaph?\) is from the Meat Puppets song, "Lake of Fire\."The segment headings are chess terms, in case that wasn't obvious, and mean the following:J'adoube: From the French, "I adjust\." A player says "J'adoube" as the international signal that he or she intends to adjust the position of a piece on the board without being subject to the touched piece rule \(in which a player who touches a piece with at least one legal move is obliged to move that piece\)\.Gambit: A chess opening in which something is sacrificed in order to achieve a better position\. \(Yes, also an X\-Men reference, but an unintentional one\)\. Castling: A special chess move involving the king and either rook, in which the king moves two squares towards a rook, then moves the rook onto the square over which the king crossed\.Endgame: The stage of the game when there are few pieces left on the board\.Checkmate: A position in which a player's king is in check and the player has no legal move \(he or she cannot move out of check\)\. A player whose king is checkmated loses the game\.Definitions courtesy of Wikipedia \(http://en\.wikipedia\.org/wiki/Chess\_terminology\)
