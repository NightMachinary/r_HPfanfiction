I don't know about you, but I usually have 2-5 tabs of fanfiction up 24/7.

While going through some of my fanfictions I was reading, I got curious as to how addicted you are.

So, on a scale of 1-10, how addicted are you to HP?

I'll tell you right now that mine breaks the scale and goes why past 100!


** I'm hovering around 8.5 most of the time. It's sort of my go-to when I'm bored and sometimes I'll find six or seven fics to look at and just leave them tabbed open for days so I can sort through which to follow.

Also, I'm on this site every fucking day.

** You people are all amateurs.

I have devised and thrown out entire fic cataloging systems because Google and ff.net aren't good enough and my own attempts at sorting have collapsed from sheer volume.

Just in H/Hr finished fics alone I have 500 bookmarks and that is a safe estimate. Adding on the pairing and non-pairing categories I easily have more fics finished than most small fanfic sites have available.

My main computer has 64GB of RAM available. I don't render videos or host 50 VM's, I leave fanfic links open.

** I've been reading HP fanfiction pretty much constantly from fall of last year to now.

- I have 230 fics bookmarked that I haven't read or attempted to read yet, because sometimes I just have to close out the tab because they're just awful.

- I have 97 fics favorited on fanfiction, 31 on AO3, 2 on LJ that I've already read and enjoyed. And I'm sure there's just as many that I've read and didn't like enough to favorite.

- And if I'm not reading, I'm writing my own.

Does that make addicted?

** 10 or 0, there's no in between for me. I either binge it almost every free moment, or don't read it at all. Most of my interests go in cycles like that. For the first time in 6 months, I read fanfiction. I read [[/u/floreatcastellum]] 's "The Aurors" last night and I really enjoyed it. I'm excited to see what comes out of that melon of theirs as I really liked how they wrote the characters.

I've several hundred bookmarked fics I need to see to, but I'm not sure when it will catch my interest again.

** Well I've been reading fanfiction for like twelve years, had midnight book releases for 5-7, midnight movie releases for 5-7, day of viewings for 2-3, and saw 4 a week before it was out because I won a trivia contest. (I saw DH part 2 midnight in Texas, then later that afternoon in Michigan. Hell of a day!)

Plus activity in forums like hexrpg, a world building project that I started like two years ago about the DoM and history of magic development, debates, and most of my supplies for my job at the school being Potter themed...

Oh and having a few hundred fics saved on my Kindle.

I'd say twelve.

** I would say a 7. I've definitely read more HP fanfiction back when I found fanfiction a decade ago, and I've gone back and forth through the years. I've recently picked up a handful of HP fanfics to read because writing my own has rekindled my interest.

I see myself spiraling more into HP in the coming future, especially since I want to re-read the books (in Spanish this time).

** Definitely an all-out Harry Potter fan, here. But I wouldn't say I'm any more or any less than any other fans. Currently I have about ten fanfiction a updating daily that I'm following, 15 fanfictions open in Chrome on my phone, and about 25 open on my computer.

I love to read, and I try to read other things, but I always go back to Harry Potter fanfiction which makes me really sad in some points, because I feel like I've already read all the good ones, when in reality I'm too lazy to look for new ones so I re-read ones I've already read and stay up to date on ones I'm all caught up on.

** Right now I've got 7 FF.net tabs open. Each one of course being H/G.

As for my HP obsession more generally... it only really became an obsession back in September of 2013 (I still liked the series before, but I wasn't really doing anything apart from re-reading a bit the canon). I think there's a fine line between being a hardcore fan and actually being addicted. So I'd say... 9.75

** Not very. 2? I normally have some fanfic opened, but I'm not addicted.

I read fanfiction because there are amazing writers, and I enjoy the community and characters. But there's not really any connection to HP for the sake of HP. I enjoy Sudden Contact linkffn(11034056) no less for the fact I've never played either setting. The same for Worm.

I enjoy them because they have good writing and tell good stories, not because of the HP element or lack thereof.

As the galaxy catches fire at this sudden conflict, unlikely alliances are formed while ancient directives are carried out by the oldest minds in the Milky Way.

** I don't know if my measly six tabs out of nine being fanfic (and only half of those HP) count me as addicted--Tumblr, Reddit, and Pandora are the other three. However, I've been in fandom continuously since '99, saw most of the tropes being created, and watched some of the 'Old Classics' as they were first being posted.

After so long in fandom, I know quite well where my tastes and interests lie--and I can usually tell within a chapter or two whether any given fic is headed even sorta in that direction. 99% of stuff posted on FF.N doesn't qualify, and even in my Tracked Tags on AO3, I still only get about a 20% return rate on stuff I'm interested in enough to keep reading after the first chapter.

Plus I'm working on a few fics, so there's that as well.

So, 8/10?
