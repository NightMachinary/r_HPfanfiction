:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi all, looking for a fic I read a couple months back (I think). I can't really recall many details of it but I remember it was a somewhat Ron-bashing fic where he ended up getting Lavender pregnant from unprotected sex. He ended up having to drop out of Hogwarts and hurriedly marry her which the Weasley family was not too pleased about. This happened about halfway through the fic I think. I remember one scene where the twins tell Harry the news by telling him "He forgot to use the charm, the stupid git" or something similar. I hope someone knows what fic this was, thanks!


** Harry Potter and the Last Chance by LeQuin linkffn(11922615). It is a Reptillia28's 'Don't Fear the Reaper' challenge story, so all appropriate warnings apply.

*** I don't really mind Ron bashing, to a degree, because I do not like him. Some fics take thing waaay to far, though. This is one of them.

**** Yup, I have very firmly did NOT offer my opinion on the story. It has some nice elements though (and some horrible ones).

***** I just think the 'proper' way to bash Ron, is to take his very human flaws, and ramp them up a bit. Any fic with an evil ron, for example is an instant drop for me.
