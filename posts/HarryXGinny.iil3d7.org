Is there any good Ginny and Harry fanfictions? Preferably hogwarts years. I just want a deeper connection than what we get in the canon books(and movies).


** My friend, go to siye.co.uk or [[/r/HarryandGinny][r/HarryandGinny]] for this. You will get MUCH better results there. About your question, I'd suggest Bits and Bobs, by Epeefencer on fanfiction.net.

** Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12924292/1/]])

This is almost Excellent story which really captures Harry as a child, pre-teen and teenager as well as a beautiful connection between him and Sirius who has no idea how to be a parent (at least at first).

It builds into a Hinny ship, but not too quickly.

*** "Not too quickly" meaning like 200 chapters in before they even hint at anything official from what I remember.

It's a really well-written fic, a perennial favourite, but /by Merlin/ when Breanie says "slow burn" they mean it.

Breanie's other works are also very good, OP. I recommend you check them out.

  What if Sirius didn't spent twelve years in prison, but was given a trial after four years? Follow the story of Sirius Black as he learns what it means to be a father/brother/guardian to his young godson & the story of Harry Potter, a young boy with a loving home who learns about the Marauders from the two men who should have raised him. Slow-burn Hinny. M for sex & violence.
