So this is going to be spoiler filled about halfway down but i'll try and mark it clearly but there will be some very minor ones (e.g.house sorting).

The premise of the fic is Ron getting visions of the future and starting to work towards avoiding that future. He sees Fred die (not a spoiler, it's like chapter 2 ) and goes full Indy!Harry wants to be really powerful to avoid it.

But unlike Indy!Harry he's still only averagely intelligent and a bit lazy. So he is considered a prodigy but he's basically just memorising his older brother's notes and practicing a ludicrous amount.

The writing is /phenomenal/. Like it's >1million words, updates very regularly and it's only been going for like a year and a bit and there are no spelling mistakes, no grammer issues, it's so well written it's unreal.

Ron is a Slytherin and it tops every single Harry in Slytherin set up by such a long distance it's like comparing My Immortal to the actual series. There's some Slytherin. Politics ^{TM} drama but it's more like house specific prefects than actual real world issues (other than recently were Ron is getting involved in real world stuff).

The romance makes me want to vomit with cringe. It's unbearable. Which makes it perfect, because they are 12. Think awkwardly talking about peck kiss vs tongue kiss with your mates. It's makes you want to die inside but it's so much more realistic than the weird pedo sex stuff most people write. All of the friendships are actually pretty well written.

*THE SPECIFIC GOOD AND BAD STUFF ABOUT IT COMES FROM HERE AND IS ALL SPOILERS*

*THE GOOD*

After about 6 months of first year Ron tells Snape and Dumbledore what's going on and they actively work with his information. The other kids don't find out because they don't have to and they slowly bring people in when needed but not before.

Also because Ron gets limited future info it moves at a completely believable pace (sort of, more later) and they currently think Voldemort has 4 horcruxes because there's no in universe evidence of more. It's so refreshing because it's not just assumptions made based off what we know.

Sirius gets freed early and Wormtail kissed. It's amazing from here because Voldemort ends up possessing Wormtail and coming back to life sooner. It even involves a potions ingredient Ron sells (basalisk venom) to a shady guy in 7th year who later sells it to a Death Eater like 400,000 words later and really shows all these little effects that his actions have. It's just amazing.

That being said Ron gets rich through a Chess Apprenticeship with Lord Greengrass and it's just fucking stupid. He makes more money from it than Harry did winning the TWT. I get it's kindof a necessity to set a lot of things up and give Ron independence and money but it's just ridiculous when you remember they're playing Chess. Make it dueling or something and i'd maybe buy it but...yeah it's chess.

The World Ender.

So the visions etc all come from an immoral being that is essentially the death of all universes, predates Death and is imprisoned by Fate. It restarts Ron's life over and over to ensure Voldemort looses, either when Ron dies or when he hits 24. It's by far my least favourite part of the series. It tortures him and the metaphysical god character stuff bothers me. It's not ever present so it's not the end of the world but I don't think it adds that much. Ron half merges with it later and it gets all weird and like he's going to be tortured for all eternity along with all other versions of him...like it's just a bit much.

Although I do like the evil Ravenclaw Ron memories/persona that's starting to bleed through occasionally. (Basically a Ron who didn't save Ginny and went insane becoming the next Voldemort and making his own Horcrux to avoid the new cycle starting, and Ron starts remembering/seeing him, it's really good).

Also Ron get's brain damage in first year from Voldemort and Chronic Stress Syndrome and it's slowly killing him. I personally don't think it's well done or accurate to how a brain injury would work in real life but there's enough of a World Ender implied effect to ignore that for me. The Stress Syndrome is a good idea though. Just not the slowly dying (which then causes the eternal torture to up the stakes later).

Other than that the bad stuff is entirely and completely associated with the utterly ludicrous timescale.

Ron is 13 after over 2.5 million words. It's an amazing story but I don't understand the decision to not have the entire plot just take longer. Not even be different, just each event take over a month instead of a week and you have a 16 year old Ron that's much more believable for everything he's expected to have done. Also he was made an ambassador to France which is the one thing that's just so beyond ridiculous for a 12 year old when it happens I can't ignore it. Because of the Brain Injury he's supposed to die before he's 15 so...just why make him so young all the time?

*TL;DR*

*Plot* 8/10 dropped only because I don't like the World Ender stuff and timescale.

*Writing* 10/10 just incredible

*Tropes* 9/10 any that are there are done better than anyone else and the only daft one is the ambassador thing

*Characters* 10/10 completely believable and well written, everyone feels different and true to canon under the circumstances

Cannot recommend it enough, don't let the length put you off!

I mean, not to be more of a dick than I usually. But, well, it's grammar. And there's sentence structure and grammatical issues in the first paragraph. And they continue through the entire first chapter.

I figured maybe it improved so I went to chapter 114. Same things.

Again, not to be more of a dick than I usually am. I mean, hell, just ask [[/u/rpeh]] about some of my spelling errors in first drafts. But the sentence structure, which is a huge component of writing, is downright awful.

Honestly, then you shouldn't be remotely calling something 'phenomenal.' There's a vast difference between 'phenomenal' and 'just incredible' writing and an author who doesn't seem to know the difference between a complete sentence, a run-on, and a fragment.

All you're doing by praising it is invalidating your own opinion when it is apparent by about the sixth paragraph that bad structure is going to stay through the entire thing. There's plenty of fanfiction that is capable of utilizing the most basic sentence structure principles.

It not bothering you is fine. But, well, that does not mean it's good writing.

And, as others have pointed out, the length alone shows that the author probably doesn't have much of a plan. I'd be willing to bet I could go through and edit out 80% of it and have the same story. A lot of it meanders. Two point five million words should be a red flag, not a selling point.

****** If you're saying that this is "one of the single greatest fanfictions ever written" then you should be able to defend that position. Retreating behind a "It's just my opinion" defence is cowardly at best.

I read this story to somewhere around the chapter 40 mark before giving up. I excused the over-simplistic grammar at the start because I read the story as kind-of coming from Ron's mind, and eight-year-old boys aren't noted for their Dickensian writing ability. The trouble is that that doesn't stand up. Not only does the writing not improve as Ron ages, but it's still poor when the scene can't possibly be from his POV. So we're left with the result that it's just simple bad writing.

Fate doesn't come close to "tower[ing] above 99% of fanfiction in it's writting style". If you want examples of good writing in fanfiction, try [[/u/TE7]] since he's already here, plus - off the top of my head - [[/u/Starfox5]], [[/u/Taure]], and [[/u/FloreatCastellum]] since they're definitely on Reddit, and then murkybluematter, WhiteSquirrel, Northumbrian, Annerb, Shayalonnie, jbern, FarenMaddox, and AngelaStarCat. I'm not always a fan of what that lot write but I can at least appreciate that they know how to do it.

As to the length, Shakespeare used 884,421 words to produce 43 plays; the King James Bible has 783,137. To point out that Fate currently has 2.5M words isn't to compare the story to either of those but to show that the author is simply rambling. Whether or not the author has a plan, he's doing a hell of a lot of meandering along whatever path may or may not have been laid down. Pick any chapter in that story and you can cut out huge chunks of it because they're just not necessary. Want an example? How about this from chapter 33 - just where I happen to be:

#+begin_quote
  Ron woke up in his bed later that night. It was clear that a Healer had been there because there was an empty potion vial on his nightstand. His headache was still there, but it wasn't nearly as bad as before. Ron hoped that he never felt that kind of pain again. Deciding to go back to sleep, he closed his eyes and began trying to find a comfortable position.
#+end_quote

That paragraph appears between two lines in the story to indicate a separate scene. It adds nothing. If you really, really want to keep the information that the healer had been there, move that bit to the next morning. But personally I think there's 70 words that can be cut without losing anything - and there are examples like that everywhere.

In summary: yes there are definitely worse pieces of fanfiction out there. A lot of them, in fact. But this one is average at best. You should really read more widely before holding up this sort of thing as one of the best around.

I've read most of the people you're talking about, this is better, substantially in some cases.

I think complaining about the length alone is pointless, there's actually more words in Harry Potter itself than those things you mentioned. No complaints. Also comparing fanfiction to Shakespeare and the Bible...come on...

You also lack the ability to debate: I wasn't comparing fanfiction to Shakespeare and the Bible, I was using the total length of Shakespeare's works and the length of the Bible to point out that this one piece of fanfiction is far too long. If you want to bring the original books into it, those total 1,084,170 for seven books. This POS is already 250% longer.

If you genuinely think this story is one of the top five of all time, I feel sorry for you.

Grow up.

One doesn't need to read a whole story to be able to judge it. I've read at least a third of the damn story and, like TE7, flicked through the rest to see if the quality of writing got any better. It doesn't. It is simplistic at best and should more accurately be described as childish.

The only thing I said in my post that could even possibly be construed as an insult was to suggest you read more widely before calling Fate one of the greatest pieces of fanfic ever. I stand by that suggestion. Just by reading the authors I listed you can find at least 100 stories that are far, far better than Fate. Not subjectively - very much objectively.

Of course, if you're actually 14 or so then this would all make more sense. If that's the case, I apologise. You'll appreciate the better writing when you grow up.

** My counter-review:

I've been following this story since around 1 million words. I enjoyed the Ron-centric POV and some parts of the plot. The issue for me is that this story comes with a lot of baggage. The writing style is bland and the author insists on capitalizing oddly, sometimes for emphasis and sometimes for no reason at all. Character arcs regarding Ron's relationships with his family and friends keep repeating. It was okay the first three times but after countless arguments with his friends and family that are resolved only to occur again, it ends up being too much.

The character arcs and slice of life sections end up creating a fic with horrendous pacing. The story is at 2 million words and at the end of the third year. The arc with the French veela families took countless chapters to resolve and the arc could honestly have been contained entirely in one of TrueSpartan's longer chapters. The politics is also disappointing. There's a lot of the posturing behavior in political fics that's cringy. Ron's hatstall leads to some of the Slytherin kids look for "new allies with Ron" instead of Draco. Theo and Blaise lecture Ron about his eating habits because they want a powerful ally. Getting a haircut is treated as a huge deal. Despite how the story describes seating and posturing as the end all to politics and the future, the end goal of all the Slytherins is winning the house cup. Don't forget the 11 year old being appointed as an ambassador to the French (did they not have one previously?). Suspension of disbelief is required as to how he achieves said position. The only consequence for Ron not actually doing his job as the ambassador is that his boss threatens to fire him if it happens again.

There are other issues as well. Ron thinks about women in the context of sex constantly. I find it hard to believe a 6th year is really pressing her breasts into a first year's face and arm because she enjoys teasing children. Who knows? Maybe it's more common than I think. Regardless, after countless incidents of Ron admiring the body of <insert whichever woman or girl>, it starts detracting from the story and piles onto the horrendous pacing. Even the magic used by Ron's auror trainer to heal him has to get him erect, because it adds a few more paragraphs. The magic system feels disappointing in some ways. Wandless magic is treated as more powerful, Dumbledore is disappointingly weak, and there's a magic dummy that can outduel and outthink aurors (but I'm willing to bet we'll never see said dummy in actual combat despite its ability to be repaired). There are a few upsides to the magic system, but not many.

Money makes no sense.

It's not all bad. Theo and Blaise have interesting characters and backgrounds. Some parts of the plot are interesting, but in the end, the story is a wish fulfillment story. That said, it's still a guilty pleasure of mine, and I do eagerly await every chapter. I wouldn't recommend it to others unless they desperately sought a Ron-centric story though. It's the Red Knight but with the problems compounded. 2.5/5, rounded down.

Yeah I did mention that, it nearly killed the fic for me and I genuinely forgot he was supposed to be 13 until one of the recent chapters when it was /still/ Christmas.

Just spreading it out would make it a loss less annoying, in particular the repeating family elements which I agree are a lot in the time frame.

I did mention this, and iirc he was recently fired hence Ron stepping in, and it's stupid. Again make him 16/17 and keep the plot and it's /almost/ believable.

I think both of these fit the age range perfectly actually. Ron's absolutely thinking about sex that much and the be all and end all of Slytherin politics being to win the house cup makes total sense to me. What else would they have to achieve?

*** Do you have any tips for how to write a Ron-centric fic? One of the people I know is writing a Ravenclaw Ron fic with Ron and Harry as protagonists. The lack of Ron fics is a problem too. The guy just want create an interesting fic. But I don't know what to tell him.

He said he has some cool concepts but is struggling with his writing style. His idea is broader and will take a lot of chapters to write. So he's confused. I don't know how help him.

****** We aren't talking Noble Prize here. But there are certainly fanfics which match the source material. "Chasing Dragons" would be a good example of this in the GoT/ASoIaF fandom (AU rebellion ends in Ned and Robert chasing Rhaegar across the narrow sea and building a kingdom there).

While I would not be as harsh as TE7 here, Fate certainly has issues when it comes to its writing. A lot of the dialogue tags could be removed and it would actually improve reading flow.

Hell, when it comes to "fanmade" fiction, I've read an insert into Sir Arthur Harris the other day over on alternatehistory, and the author had a research bibliography which would put most PhDs to shame. And even though it was stunningly researched and had very good characters, I would be hesitant to describe it in such a style like your review here.

Fate might be good or it might not, I have no interest in reading the whole thing since I find Ron boring (I had never heard of Fate before clicking on this thread), but "one of the single greatest fanfiction" is a bit too much for the writing as it is. Too dialogue-heavy and it could do with a bit of editing.

** Too long, didn't read. Or rather, I tried to read the first few chapters. There are some punctuation and grammar mistakes, but it's just boring. I can see so many redundant words that could be cut to improve the prose.

For example, part of chapter 12 could go from this:

Ron stepped into the abandoned room and immediately noticed a giant ornate mirror in the middle of it. It had clawed feet, and a gold frame that had odd inscriptions carved into it. This is the mirror with Harry's parents... Was he telling the truth? Bloody hell... How do we get them out! Ron stepped out of the cloak and slowly approached the mirror, with Harry quick on his tail.

"See Ron" Harry said, his tone boastful. "My parents are in there! C'mon have a look!" Harry said as he overtook Ron and jumped in front of the mirror. Harry looked hungrily at the reflection in the mirror, while Ron stood just a little behind Harry. All Ron could see was Harry, but it was clear to Ron that Harry saw much more as the boy-who-lived had tears welling up in his eyes.

"Harry..." Ron said softly, making Harry turn and face him. "Harry, I don't see your parents in there... just you." Harry looked at Ron in bewilderment, and then Harry shook his head hard.

"No Ron, they're right there! I can see them!" Harry implored, his voice was strained. "Come here" Harry said quickly as he pulled Ron into the spot that Harry was just now occupying, right in front of the mirror. "Ok, now look into the mirror..." Ron gave Harry a quick smile, though Ron felt quite sad at seeing Harry so desperate for something. Ron then turned and looked into the mirror. What he saw within brought tears into his eyes, and a terribly sad smile upon his lips.

Ron's reflection was surrounded by his loved ones, and his loved ones were all older than they were now. Fred was standing right behind Ron, alive and happy, and he had his arm draped around Ron's shoulders. Around them were the members of the Weasley and Lovegood families, all of them were beaming at Ron. They looked so happy, so content, and so full of life. Ron felt his own hands tremble slightly and he gave a wet chuckle at the sight. /They're all alive, and unharmed... Fred is alive! I did it!/

To this:

Ron stepped into the abandoned room and noticed a giant mirror with clawed feet and a gold frame. The top was covered in odd inscriptions.

This is the mirror with Harry's parents. Was he telling the truth? Bloody hell... How do we get them out? Ron stepped out of the cloak and slowly approached the centre of the room with Harry quick on his tail.

"See Ron," boasted Harry, "my parents are in there! C'mon, have a look!" Harry jumped in front of the mirror, looking hungrily at his reflection while Ron stood behind. All he could see was Harry, but it was clear to him that Harry saw much more.

"Harry..." Ron began softly, making Harry turn and face him. "Harry, I don't see your parents in there... just you."

Harry looked at Ron in bewilderment, tears falling. "No Ron, they're right there! I can see them!"

"Come here," Harry said, pulling Ron in front of the mirror. "Ok, now look into the mirror..." Ron gave Harry a quick smile, though Ron felt quite sad seeing him so desperate for something. He turned and looked into the mirror.

Ron's reflection was surrounded by his older loved ones. Fred was standing right behind him, alive and happy, his arm draped around Ron's shoulders. The rest of the Weasley and Lovegood families surrounded them, beaming. They looked so full of life. Ron felt his eyes water and he let out a wet chuckle. /They're all alive, and unharmed! Fred is alive! I did it!/

Not perfect but a bit better. Little changes here and there can really help trim the fat.

The word count is another factor. 2.5 /million/ words and it's only completed up to third year? Maybe if I read from the beginning it'd be easier. I really want to enjoy this fic but it's just too much.
