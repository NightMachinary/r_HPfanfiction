I'm going on a flight tomorrow so I'll have no internet access.

Does anyone know if you can open up an entire fanfic at once instead of chapter by chapter so I can read it on the plane?

Or does anyone know of any really really long one shots?


** Fics on AO3 can be downloaded using the AO3 'Download' button for offline reading. Fics on fanfiction.net requires an app or website tool like FFnet Downloader.

** Although it is no longer being actively maintained/upgraded, I've found [[http://www.omnibuser.com/][Omnibuser]] to be useful for saving fanfics.

*** I think I only used it for spacebattles and/or sufficientvelocity and it was very temperamental. Best ones for most mainstream sites currently is ff2ebook.com, I'd say

** Ficsave.xyz is a site that Lets you download from ffn and a few other sites to a variety of formats. It's what I would recommend to save full stories.

** You can use the bot to link stories from Fanfiction, linkffn(#), or Archive of Our Own, linkao3(#). It will give you download links (epub and mobi, I think) for them.

(You might have to open the link in a regular browser, not just from the reddit app.)

** There's a application on the chrome store where it scans every thing in the fanfiction and then you can copy it all at once and put it onto a Word document I can't remember what it's called though

*** No need for an app to copy/paste from ffn. If you're using an actual computer and not a tablet/phone, just bring up the mobile version of the page (replace the "www" with "m") and the text is completely selectable.

** AO3 can open a whole story at once. FFN, not so much.
