Since if they're that common the staff should have suspected and handled the basillisk promptly for the school to be the safest place.

** I'm in the American southeast, so maybe it's different here, but there's a ridiculous amount of child endangerment going on in the schools here right now, and they're generally still open.

Also, when I lived in the northeast, this happened at a school near me: The gym had a wall that moved to divide the room into two rooms. The wall had a safety feature, that it could move only if a person was turning the key while standing right in the spot where they could see the wall. All the teachers did as they were told by the administration and overrode this safety feature by turning the key, then hanging a weight so it seemed like there was still a person's hand turning the key, then leaving that area to supervise kids elsewhere.

One kid, a class clown, thought it would be fun to squeeze past this wall as it was moving. His backpack got caught and he was slowly crushed to death as he screamed for help, in sight of all the other kids, including the son of a friend of mine. That school didn't get shut down.

So yeah, I can believe Hogwarts didn't get shut down.

***** I do note that this incident happened in January 2001, which was not far off from the wild and wooly days of the 1990's that HP took place in.

IIRC, the modern school safety measures that kids today deal with began with the Columbine Shooting in April 1999. That started a conversation about bullying which was simply not happening before that. Bullying was taken as morally wrong on the part of the bully, but just something that happened as part of the childhood experience- maybe something that was even good for kids so they could "toughen up". No one gave a shit about it otherwise.

Then 911 happened and security really ramped up, plus continued school shootings and zero tolerance policies.

If in that time period it was actually a Ok thing to do then maybe Voldemort and Grindelwald were onto something with their world-conquest plots.

************ From one side we have Lucius let's-kill-all-muggles Malfoy and from the other Arthur let's-study-their-mating-habits Weasley, no, they aren't big on respect for muggles.

They play Quidditch in a school where the nurse actually can deal with any problem caused by the game, in their houses we only see the Weasley's who don't use Buldgers (let's be frank here, without the Buldge the sport isn't much more dangerous than football) and even in school people worried that the Buldge could cause damage when it was cursed in COS, a small child being attacked in the head by what is comparatively a very, very smaller-scale buldge in an environment where there /isn't/ someone capable of dealing with any problems in seconds by someone who barely anyone in their society and government would consider even human would cause problems.

I generally regard the danger of Quidditch and it's reception by society by comparing with the punishment for thief in ancient societies. In that kind of society thief was taken much more seriously than today, with the punishment sometimes reaching even mutilation and death. But thing is, at that time it actually made sense to punish thief harder than today, there wasn't any form of global surveillance, and what they had was limited by the available technology, the time it took to pass information along, misunderstandings with the information that was passed on, politics... which made it much easier to get away with stealing; considering that there was also much less products and the production of what they had was much slower and the many problems related to distribution of food and thief become a much greater problem than it is today. All this sums up to a need of trying to curb such practice so as to not let it grow to the point of creating large-scale problems for everyone, and the way they found of doing such was using gruesome displays to create fear of the consequences for those who were caught.

It all comes down to how easy or hard it is to repare the damage and what would be the consequences if it becomes widespread, Quidditch results in a great deal of damage, but it is relatively easy to solve (taking at most one night to completely re-grow bones) so it isn't an issue, at least while there is a competent healer around, but Harry didn't have the luxury of having a healer to help him at that point, so while the injury itself wouldn't be as grave as the ones from Quidditch the reception to it would be much harsher.

************** Assuming it's velocity is about as high as a cannonball if not higher and that their vests have absolutely no protection? Maybe. Remember that the bludgers move at a slow enough pace as to be dodged on brooms (fast, but not really something otherworldly) and the force the balls create when at full speed is enough to only break a bone, Harry didn't suffer anything worse than that during the incident at second year despite having been bitten at full force on the arm, this, plus the fact that the beaters are capable of sending them in other directions at all imply that not only are the bludgers much lighter than we would first imagine but probably also hollow and moving at much more manageable speeds.

We also have to take into consideration that their clothes must have at least some minor kind of protection. The Weasley Twins figures out how to create protego imbued hats and they were barely out of school to say nothing of not having expressed any focus towards enchanted clothing, so it stands to reason that the clothes used specifically for a dangerous sport might have some protection to stop things from getting too bad. At a stretch it would make sense (though I'm the first to admit that it is only conjecture with little to no evidence) if every article of clothing had some protection against trauma-damage.

Between wizards being more resistant and wizards having better protection my explanation is actually more in line with biology. Of course we wouldn't see it in Quidditch through the ages, same way we don't see that wizards are more resilient, why the hell would information about clothing be at all relevant in a book about the history of a sport, even more so if such protection is the rule instead of the exception?

If the bludgers are as you describe then the beaters must be moving at a speed even higher than that, have the adequate reflex and not only be tougher than regular humans have any right to be, but also much stronger as well to be able to beat the balls in other direction when moving at full speed, the bats would also have to be enchanted to not break on contact.

Newt straight up says in Fantastic Beasts that Wizards have a different physiology than muggles which is why he doesn't need a helmet like Kowalski when dealing with a magical creature and why magical poison affects muggles much stronger.

******************** The detail about physiology was first mentioned by Clearence's (Aurelios'? I am still confused by that plot twist at the end of CoG) care-giver (can't think of a better way of calling her) it was only implied that magicals have distinctive esthetic characteristics and even that doesn't make much sense since she never saw it in Clearence. Newt never said that he was immune to physical damage, only that forgor his name was vulnerable to it, it could easily be that he was confident that he could cast a protective spell fast enough to save himself but didn't want to risk it with another person who isn't able of using magic while he was worrying about dealing with a Rhino with an explosive horn. And I also remember what JKR wrote in Pottermore, it was in the section on healing and she directly said that wizard healing could overwrite non-magical health issues, a wizard won't be able to just ignore a scorpion poison, but he will be able to deal with it with absolutely no problem. You want to quote someone, be sure they are saying what you think.

We know that the Firebolt /can/ go up to this speed, now I ask, if there are plenty of different kinds of brooms on the game that are slower why isn't the difference more remarkable? Harry should be able to fly in circles around any other seeker. The answer is that while he can get to this speed inertia is still a thing, so if he goes too fast he won't be able to just change directions on a moment's notice when the snitch change it's path, to say nothing of things like the risk of just flying straight outside the field or the risk of him colliding on other players. And then it still doesn't answer how wizards would be able to beat bludgers around if they really are as heavy and moving as fast as you are saying, even more considering that they would need to gather velocity in the movement of the bat in relation with their bodies to prevent the buldger of just knocking the bat out of their hands while messing their balance. Either they are super-strong in and /out/ of the field or they have equipment helping them.

Fred and George managed to put a spell that protects against magic in their hats, in no moment was there said anything that suggests that there weren't spells in the clothes protecting against physical damage. I will be the first to admit that the protective spells on clothes is a HC more than anything, but the resistance thing is also a HC, the fact that it is widespread doesn't make it cannon or logically sound and I still say that my protective clothes HC is more reasonable as in it doesn't create so many plot-holes. The players use different clothing for games and it is also not addressed in the book, if the use of protective charms in clothes is widespread enough it would have been considered implicit.

And yet Draco broke Harry's nose at HBP, Neville broke his wrist at PS, Snape was bitten by the Cerberus, Umbridge felt threatened by the arrows in OoTP, Harry wasn't physically stronger than the Dursley's... I stand by what I said, either wizards are more durable than muggles and this applies to all situations or they are physically the same but have ways of solving the problem afterwards.

This wasn't even mentioned in cannon, do your research right before declaring something cannon or call it what it is as I did: *HEAD* cannon

Yeah, I did take specific situations in cannon and used it plus logic to create a theory, news flash: you are doing the same thing.

  I decided that, broadly speaking, wizards would have the power to correct or override ‘mundane' nature, but not ‘magical' nature. Therefore, a wizard could catch anything a Muggle might catch, but he could cure all of it; *he would also comfortably survive a scorpion sting that might kill a Muggle, whereas he might die if bitten by a Venomous Tentacula.*

We see countless scenes were Harry puts in full speed when aiming for the Snitch, hes faster than other because of his broom, but not much more, Draco for example still catches his broom at one point with his hand, And we see several scenes especially in Chamber of Secrets that show that Bludgers are faster than brooms.

There aren't distinct charms to protect against physical damage or magic, the shield charm is used for both and thats what the Weasley twins invented protective clothing with.

If Neville had been a muggle child a fall from over twenty feet would have done much more than just break his wrist, especially since he didn't know how to fall properly.

And breaking a nose doesn't mean much since thats just damaged cartilages, not any bone or muscle, there isn't any reason why increased durability would protect from it.

Snape being bitten by a magical Creatures proves nothing since it being dangerous was the reason it was put there in the first place, you notice how it's not able to get heal quickly either.

Centaurs are beings with several kinds of their own magic, obliviously Umbridge felt threatened when they were literally threatening her.

******* I mean, the attacks on the Longbottoms happened /after/ Voldemort was dead, and Lucius was only one amongst quite a few followers that walked free. Dumbledore says exactly this in OotP:

#+begin_quote
  “You might ask---and with good reason---why it had to be so. [...]

  “My answer is that my priority was to keep you alive. You were in more danger than perhaps anyone but I realised. Voldemort had been vanquished hours before, but his supporters---and many of them are almost as terrible as he---were still at large, angry, desperate and violent. And I had to make my decision, too, with regard to the years ahead. Did I believe that Voldemort was gone for ever? No. I knew not whether it would be ten, twenty or fifty years before he returned, but I was sure he would do so, and I was sure, too, knowing him as I have done, that he would not rest until he killed you.

  “I knew that Voldemort's knowledge of magic is perhaps more extensive than any wizard alive. I knew that even my most complex and powerful protective spells and charms were unlikely to be invincible if he ever returned to full power.

  “But I knew, too, where Voldemort was weak. And so I made my decision. [...] Your mother's sacrifice made the bond of blood the strongest shield I could give you.”
#+end_quote

I'm pretty agnostic on the whole sending-Harry-to-Petunia thing, tbh, but clearly Dumbledore assumes he has this one chance, right now and never again, and if he doesn't take it, it's gone and Harry would end up like the Longbottoms or worse (if death is worse).

********* You're assuming DD knew that actual abuse was taking place, and also that the definition of abuse is is the same in the Wizarding World as in the muggle. DD knew Petunia didn't have much love for magic. I don't think that he knew Harry was missing meals, and even though Harry was missing meals, I don't think it's really meant to be to the levels fanon makes it. Canon says he was never starved, exactly. He was made to sleep in a cupboard, was he ever actually locked in, in canon? I don't think so. And there's no one outside the household who even knew about it. He was made to wear Dudley's old clothes- wizards don't know shit about muggle fashion.

So what DD would have known about was Petunia was cold to him, had him do some outside chores- I don't think all day most days to anywhere near the extent that fanon has it- and he wore baggy clothes. Ok, is that removable abuse?

Yes, but there's no evidence Dumbledore or anyone in government knew of either of those instances. The twins and Ron knew, and they told Molly who may or may not have taken them seriously, but I don't think it went any farther.
