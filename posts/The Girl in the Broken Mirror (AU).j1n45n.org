Hello. This fic has now hit the 40,000-words milestone and I wanted to share this with you all.

*Summary:* In the summer before her fifth year, Iris Potter is given a journal that belonged to her mother from Sirius. She discovers that Lily Evans and her maternal line have been practitioners of forgotten arcane arts since time immemorial; in a desperate attempt to rid herself of her hated enemy Voldemort, Iris attracts the attentions of ancient entities with unimaginable power. Now she must gamble things she never even knew she had, to find the strength to survive.

This fic focuses on a fifth year fem!Harry but with a deeper background AU inspired by /Dresden Files/, /Pact/ and other supernatural works. Rituals, Legilimency, and Occlumency will serve as the tools of Iris' survival in a world that is much bigger than she ever imagined.
