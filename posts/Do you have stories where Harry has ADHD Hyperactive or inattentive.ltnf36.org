  What happens when a brain damaged Harry and a transgender Hermione both get sorted into Slytherin? Snape's not sure, but he thinks it's likely to be an interesting term. This story follows various first years through the trials of their first year.

  Harry Potter is a geek, a nerd, a total dork whose favorite hobby is "transfiguring stuff." He doesn't understand what rules are, has no social skills, is barely sentient, and is very smart.

** Harry is autistic in The Little Bat by Elvirakitties, but it's a Severus/Tom Riddle and a bit cracky, not to mention Dumbledore-bashing and still in progress. But hey, it's a neurodivergent Harry. linkao3(11811135)

There was a mentor!Snape fic I read once but can't remember---wish I could!---where one of the Dursley rules was for Harry to "not think," so he trained himself to keep his mind jumping from topic to topic. In a detention, Snape tells him something like, "don't even think about X," and he reflects that he has a lot of practice at that. Later Snape berates him for not concentrating, and finds out about his self-taught deficiency.
