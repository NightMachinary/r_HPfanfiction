So I'm totally in love with this fic by MayMarlow and was wondering if anyone knows something similar?

For those that don't know this fic. Is a Harry travels back in time to raise Tom. Is really good.

I tried "47 days to change" but didn't like Harry in that one

I also tried Crawlersout. Harry gets too close to be a Mary Sue a little too often for my taste but is good. The world building compensates a lot.

I also tried Red Right Hand about Hermione and not Harry raising Tom but this one I didn't like at all.

I would be okay with Voldemort raising Harry too. I do love Train to Nowhere.

I'm looking for a super slow burn with a lot of character study.

  After the infamous massacre of the Potters, young Harry Potter went missing. It doesn't really help that years later he turns up again, a bit darker, stranger and more erratic than anyone had hoped for. But Harry hardly cares, since in the end it's his decision on which side he will fight; Dark, Light or no side at all.

  Harry, after being saved by a mysterious stranger, is flung fifty years into the past, where he resolves to save the future by killing a 10-year-old Tom Riddle. He ends up raising him, instead. But when young Tom develops an unhealthy fixation on his new guardian, things quickly spiral out of control, and Harry finds himself entangled in a deadly game. Will history repeat itself?
