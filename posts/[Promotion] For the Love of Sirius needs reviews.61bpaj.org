** This is... surprisingly good. The story starts and proceeds well, there's no extraneous stream-of-consciousness that inexperienced writers often resort to, and there's no jarring out-of-character behaviour. I hope the author decides to continue writing and updating this story.

I just realised that this sounds awfully negative. I like the story and encourage others to read it, also.

** Just left a review at the link! It surprisingly exceeded my expectations, since the author includes original elements (or at least stuff I haven't read before) instead of resorting to clich√©s. Definitely would recommend!
