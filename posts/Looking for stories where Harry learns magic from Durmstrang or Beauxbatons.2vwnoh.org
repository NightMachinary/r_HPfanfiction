I'd love to read a story about Harry learning magic from somewhere else besides Hogwarts. Or any good story in general.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life][A Second Chance at Life]] and sequels by Miranda Flairgold certainly qualifies.

*** I did come across this one and I very much enjoy it. It's the story that prompted me to wonder what else was out there.

*** It was also jist updated January this year after a pretty long lull. Way more excited for this than I am for updated nightmares of futures past.

** I'll edit this with a link when I get back to my computer, but Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum is a story that I really like with Harry, Draco, and Viktor going to Durmstang together.

Edit: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9939304/1/Si-Vis-Pacem-Para-Bellum][Here]] we go. If you like action, particularly dueling and quidditch, you'll love this fic.

**** Hmm, I didn't even notice that Thanks to a Snake was by the same author. I might have to give that another try, as I'm a fan of Harry/Daphne. I could never get past part where he decides to go by "Hadrian," is it worth it to push through that kind of thing?

***** I hated that too, but I found you stop noticing the annoyance after a few chapters and hadrian sounds right. Like in a second chance at life when rahkesh just started making sense.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3762636/1/The-Black-Heir][The Black Heir]] is the only real Durmstrang fic I've read so far

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4001281/1/][Jaded Eyes of a Prodigy]] is an odd one where he goes to a school we haven't heard of before. It's not exactly a happy ending, but they do win, and it is complete. Dark Harry, and the summary says LVHP, though I don't remember their exact dynamic.
