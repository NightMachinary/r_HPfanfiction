I'm looking for a fic where instead of returning to life in the train station with Dumbledore, Harry instead decides to travel to an alternate universe and give the horcrux in his scar a proper childhood.

He gets new books from a being on the train about old magic and finds a house near the Weasleys and Lovegoods that he buys.

The Potters are alive and he makes friends with Luna's mother who assumes he is a spell crafter when she sees him cast spells from the old books.

The only other thing I remember is that he is trying to learn the fidelius.


** If I remember correctly this fits the bill. linkao3(1358209)
