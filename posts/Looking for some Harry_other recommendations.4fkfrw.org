  I'm looking more for the hurt/comfort, angst, damaged goods aspects of these stories.
#+end_quote

I super highly recommend Grow Young With Me. It just hits all the right notes.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

  Alternate Universe. Two hurting, almost broken people reach toward the sunlight. This story has implied sexual violence and a Ginny who is two years younger than she was in canon.

** Try linkao3(Tomorrowland by winterfool). It is frustratingly incomplete, but probably the best H/L fic.

Alternatively, linkffn(The Quidditch World Cup by TheEndless7) is quite good as well, but Luna is the one with issues.

linkffn(The First Day) probably fits this as well to some degree, though if you have read Tomorrowland and Seeking Ginny you have probably read this too.

linkffn(The Refiners Fire) and it's sequels are pretty damn angsty, but IIRC they haven't aged very well. That said it's 1 million words of teen angst, so maybe you are OK with that.
