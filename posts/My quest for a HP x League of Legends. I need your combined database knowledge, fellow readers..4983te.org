So, I recently became interested in crossovers again. In particular I became interested in a crossover between League of Legends and the Harry Potter universe.

Riot Games has really put a lot of effort into their story in the last year. Runeterra started off as a clusterfuck of thrown together lores that had no real connection beside the occasional opponent relationships (Soraka - Warwick) and the overlying Demacia - Noxus conflict. Compare that to the recent stories of Emperor Azir, or Kindred. A big leap towards engaging world and story.

But my search brought up nothing on FFN. All I found was mediocre at best, and if it was written well enough, it barely stretched the 5k words mark and/or had more than 1 chapter. Also I found some weird Harry becomes Jinx challenge... yeah.

So, I ask you: Do you know of any crossover between HP and LoL?


** Nothing of any quality. I have an idea for a Xerath!Harry (fuck the lore) but it'll be a while before I start writing it.

Best chance is to write it yourself, I'm afraid.

*** Unfortunatly, thats not an option. I'm already writing on two stories and am slow to update as it is.

Seems I have to wait for someone to get down to it.

*** Wrong game, but honestly, I'd take the Dota2 crossover as well.

*** But would Harry be an exort invoker or a quas-wex invoker

Er, really? If anything, the opposite is true. They're on record as saying that a story is unnecessary for a video game. League is a collection of popular character tropes, nothing more. The lore is about as deep as a kiddie swimming pool.

*** In comparison, of course. They went from "close to none" to "patchwork" with their lore.

Runeterra will never come close to thought out worlds like that of Warcraft, The Witcher,...

But recent events like Bilgewater, Mount Targon or the various new lores for their champions begin to draw a more detailed image. Its still a lot of tropes, yes, but at least they get a bit more depth. They also do a lot to make their old champions fit better.

And I also completely agree with them that for a Moba, story is not necessary. However, they realize that by adding story, they can give characters their players care about more depth and hence, get more emotional attachement from the players.
