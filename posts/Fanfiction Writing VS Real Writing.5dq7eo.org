** I don't like the idea that fanfiction is less "real" than original work. Not everyone wants to write professionally - fanfiction is a fun pastime, and it's not less real or less work because it's fanfiction.

Implying it's not real implied there's less work and effort in the actual writing, and that's not necessarily true.

*** And it doesn't involve any less time or effort either. Some fanfics are true masterpiece that could very well be standalone or sequel. And sometimes surpass the original.

***** The OP didn't say fanfiction takes less time and effort - in fact they said that fanfiction is more difficult and more time-consuming for them.

The opposite is true for me - I find wriiting original fiction much more difficult. But everybody is different and plenty of people write both. The reasons for and rewards from writing either are different.

*** I was going to say. Some of these stories are better - overall - than those that have gone through professional editing. Most of them are more entertaining, but then the background story is already set.

There's something for just about anyone that reads fiction.

** The latter means I spend a lot of time on world-building. It requires more effort in that regard, so it is not something I can do without mental preparations (so to say), but the very fact that what I am writing is about something /I/ created leaves me with that sense of fulfilment.

That said, if I were to put my notes about the world created and its lore and the basic mechanics of how certain important for it things work, I'd get another book out of it, and not just a thin booklet at that.

PS. I'd change “real” to “original”, as it's quite a commonly used way to refer to stories that fully originate from their authors rather than being derivative works (which, by the way, is also a fine way to call fanfics: “derivative works/writing”).

** It would certainly be easier for ME to write fan fiction ( especially HP ) because of course I'd already have a lot of foundation to begin with. I don't think that me doing that, and "playing in someone else's sandbox" debases my own creative writing ability. Its not like any 'good' fan fiction writer is writing the Canon work over scene for scene ( though some do ). I think it takes equal ability to be able to pull it off smoothly.

** I like both. The attraction of the fanfiction is the heavy lifting of the world building is done. The stage is set now I get to play on it. Then again I write stories that revolve around OCs which seems to be fairly atypical for HP fanfic.

** I enjoy writing both. In my original fiction, I love the greater freedom I have, there is no way a character "should" be, there are no limits other than the ones I give myself. My motivation for original fiction is, among others, to write something worth publishing, while that for obvious reasons is not a possibility with fanfiction. Fanfiction I continue to write for the fun of exploring JKR's magical world, for the readers who enjoyed reading my story so far, and also for the at times insightful reviews I get that help me improve my writing. For me, writing fanfiction is a bit like a treat. I enjoy it, but I'm aware that it won't get me anywhere in life. I can't publish it, won't put it on my resume, I won't mention it in interviews, while with original fiction these things are at least possible (even if not probable ;) ).

** I like both equally, I'd say. Writing my own stuff is challenging. You can't just type ahead and hope for the best if you want the result to be any good. Characters need to be designed, story-elemets and plot,............

Fanfiction is great because it lets me just type ahead, almost meditative. Its a great pastime if I can't focus 100% on what I'm currently doing. Its gets my head free and the results of that get posted on FFN from time to time.

  How do you feel writing fanfiction compared to writing your own story?
#+end_quote

I've had what you might call a ‘difficult relationship' with fanfiction. It is two years ago almost to the day that I started posting my first story. Of course I was looking for some sort of validation and I didn't get it -- not at all. It pretty well crushed my already fragile self-esteem. It's painful even to remember how awful I felt at that time.

You would think I'd have stopped then and taken up crochet or something, but I'm a bit bloody minded and I didn't. I'd caught the writing bug, and once you've got it, it's hard to get rid of. From the sense of failure grew a desire to understand why what I had written failed to engage many readers. Was I a bad writer or a bad storyteller or was it just that I was in the wrong place altogether? I suspect that if my fanfiction stories had been more popular I would not have felt the need to move into original fiction, so unpopularity can indirectly have a positive effect. I became interested in the whole storytelling process; the tradition, form, structure, archetypes and why things work in certain ways. So I kept writing fanfiction, but fought my way through ‘The Seven Basic Plots', joined a local CW group and started writing some original pieces. Then I started taking an evening class and wrote some short stories and at last I realised I didn't have to write fanfiction any more. I could write anything. It took a while for me to fall in love with my own characters, but when I did, it was liberating. They're mine, I can do whatever I want with them and it's delicious.

So now, as I write what is technically my first novel (and everyone knows first novels are always terrible) I don't regard it as my real first novel. My first novels are my fanfictions; that was my apprenticeship. And yes, the first one was pretty bad but my writing has improved over subsequent ones.

I find writing original fiction harder and more challenging than writing fanfiction. I wrote an 80k fanfiction in seven months, it will take me at least twice that long to write the same length of original fiction. It's frustrating and exhilarating in equal measure, but I'm finding it very rewarding - though I do hope to go back next year and finish the fanfiction I put on hold back in September.
