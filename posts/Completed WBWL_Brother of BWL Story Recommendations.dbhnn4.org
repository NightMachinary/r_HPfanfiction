Recently been on a fanfiction binge, and I stumbled on Three Black Birds linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13247979/1/Three-Black-Birds]]) which I binged in a day.

While I am happy that it is being actively updated with weekly chapter releases, I've got an itch that I am hoping that you guys can help scratch with some COMPLETED wbwl/brother of bwl stories that have been completed in the past 3-4 years.

I don't care if it's the most trashy story (just no slash, not really my thing), I'll take any recommendations. I've read a couple in the past, though I really can't remember any names, so I'm just hoping to catch up on any new completed fics that fall within this category.


** linkffn(Antithesis) is great. Definitely tragic, one of my favorite stories.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

*** Worth noting that this isn't a typical WBWL fic - it's a deconstruction of most of the common tropes like James and Lily being assholes to Harry, Harry being a Slytherin who's distrusted, a political genius etc. It starts out by playing these straight, but piece by piece you realise that everything in The Sinister Man's world makes sense and fits together. No "why didn't character A just do X?" plotholes or inconsistent worldbuilding.

It also has a hell of a lot of exploration of magic and wizarding society, in a way that manages to be both consistent with JK's vision most of the time, and actually considered and detailed and logical.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween, the wizarding world hailed Harry's younger brother Thomas as The Boy Who Lived. But were they right? As Tom starts Hogwarts, wheels are set in motion, assumptions are questioned, and lives are changed forever. Harry's POV. He's two years older than canon, light, and smart. Eventual HP/DG.

** linkao3(brothers divided by jeleania) is a good one, slightly outside your timeframe because it was published in 2014. At 14K words, it's a quick read and complete. I really appreciated it because it has the brothers raised together and doesn't feature abusive/neglectful Potters; I don't remember any character bashing either.

  For as long as he could remember, Harry Potter hadn't been alone. By his side had been his twin Jason.Then they arrived at Hogwarts and were Sorted into different Houses. Suddenly, a chasm lay between them, one Harry couldn't cross and Jason refused to.So Harry had to learn how to stand without his twin, finding friends and fighting a war along the way.
