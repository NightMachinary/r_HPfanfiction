** Honestly, there are very few(if any) decent HP SIs. Your best bet would probably be space battles or sv.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter, Self-Insert by 15Redstones) shameless self promotion, the first chapters are rough (I plan to rewrite them sometime) but I'm getting some good reviews on the rest. No ships until at least 6th year.

#+begin_quote
  I am a 18 year old fanfiction writer, schoolkid and computer nerd. I also just woke up in the body of 8 year old Harry Potter. How did I get here? No idea. What am I going to do? Priority one, survive. Priority two, drag this world into the 21st century.
