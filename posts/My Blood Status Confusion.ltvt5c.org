pureblood + pureblood = pureblood

pureblood + any non-pureblood = halfblood

halfblood + halfblood = ?

muggle + muggle = muggleborn

muggleborn + muggleborn = ?

Are you a pureblood only if your ancestors are pureblood? Additionally, is it better for you to be a halfblood with pureblood/halfblood than pureblood/muggleborn, or are all halfbloods put into the same category in terms of purity? is it better or worse to have creature blood than it is to have muggle blood? Please help <3


** I think a pureblood is any person with 4 magical grandparents. So presumably, if someone has four muggleborn grandparents, they would considered a pureblood. But I'm not 100% sure

** Depends on who is asking. And who is answering.

And realistically, I think that's the way it should be.

So there really isn't one answer. Leaving aside that they sweep unliked relatives not fitting their dogma under the rug, the idea of Malfoys or Blacks concerning purebloods clearly is having all-magical (and hence, pureblood) ancestors for all eternity. That aside, as Rowling notes, it often functions more like a declaration of intent than a true fact: Declaring yourself a pureblood means this is relevant to you; you're not going to get involved with Muggles.

On the other hand, even though there is actually /no/ quote literally saying this (only one of Rowling noting similiarities with Aryan rules in Nazi Germany), a formal definition might be "all-magical grandparents", so Harry's children would be purebloods.

And finally, you might conceive of conservative circles, as opposed to extreme blood fanatics, who consider /ancestry/, and if a family name like the Potters has been around for many hundred years in the magical world, then they will remain equals, regardless who they marry, and as such might be considered "purebloods". We don't see that in the books though. Harry is clearly a halfblood because of Lily's parents, but since he never cared about his family name either way, it's not like he ever tried to be anything else.

** First of all, I want to point that the "Blood Status" are only a social construct. There is absolutely no "physical" difference between a Muggleborn, a Half Blood and a Pure blood, and Harry despite being considered as a "Halfblood", Harry might as well has been a Muggleborn since there is absolutely no difference between him and, let's say, Colin Creevey.

Now, Pottermore (which is not really Canon I know) gives the number of "3 Generations" before someone being considered a Pureblood. It means that, while Harry children would still be considered Half Blood, his Grandchildren may be Pureblood depending of who his children marry.\\
But since the Blood Status is a social construct, the attitude of the witches and wizards matters a lot in how they are considered. A witche like Umbridge manage to sell herself as a Pureblood for most of her life, despite having a Muggle mother. And at the same time, a family that has been magical for 10 generations could be still considered as "Half blood" if they keep talking about their Muggle Ancestor. Hell, in DH some Muggleborn even tried to present themselves as Halfblood, explaining they are just a distant cousin or the child of a Squibb line (and I guess some of them managed to succed).

â€‹

Concerning your questions :

- Halfblood + Halfblood = Halfblood or Pureblood (depending of how many generations of magical ancestor the 2 Halfbloods have)
- Muggleborn + Muggleborn = Half Blood (no matter what their parents were, they have magical parent, they are halfblood)
- Only the Blood Purist care about the Blood status, and they make a distinction among Half Blood depending of the parents, though they also take other factor into consideration before judging someone (talent, loyalty . . .).\\
  As an example, Harry as the child of Pureblood and a talented Muggleborn, should technically have more value in the eyes of the Blood Purist than someone like Snape (Pureblood + Muggle). But since Snape is on their side and Harry against, they prefer Snape. Also they have the habit to call every pureblood who is against them a "Blood Traitor", which automatically make them worthless and "killable".

*** This was really well thought out!! The blood status system is very obviously weak and easily disregarded by those who subscribe to it, but it's still super interesting to see the distinctions!!

** Its a fairly obvious analogy for racism and so a hard line distinction is impossible. Some extremists might think that any muggle blood ever makes someone impure where others may say magical grandparents are enough to be purebloods.

Stop trying to make hard and fast rules for a cultural system based around racism, any fic will be better for the author understanding the nuance that needs to be here.

I am acutely aware of the racism analogy (I'm Black), and while I agree racism doesn't necessarily have rules, there will /always/ be a hierarchy. Much like how colorism allows a lightskinned Black person to succeed more than a brownskinned person (and both will trump darkskinned people), I was curious about how this may translate into the magical communities, particularly with how halfbloods are perceived.

**** You have somehow managed to quote and restate my point whilst missing it entirely. Its not something that can be easily defined as 2 halfblood parents > muggleborn + pureblood. Everything revolves around personal opinions and as such, there are no solid rules.

#+end_quote

Depends on the parents of those half-bloods. If they're all magical, then the child of the half-bloods will be a pure-blood. Otherwise, they're also a half-blood.

(Of course, chances are that blood-purist extremists like the Malfoys and the Blacks might disregard this and view the child as a half-blood, irrespective of them having all magical parents and grandparents.)

Half-blood.

** Whether it's good/bad to have creature blood I think depends on what creature as well as location/country we are speaking of. For instance, the veelas in France are almost revered, are they not? While my understanding is that in England, folks with creature blood are looked down upon. Hagrid and the headmistress of Beubatons(sp?) for instance.

** I made my own sort of chart for blood status a while ago that isn't totally accurate canonically or by some others' point-of-view, but is accurate for my own writing.

You're only a pureblood if you have four magical grandparents. Those grandparents don't have to be purebloods. They can all be Muggleborns, and so long as your parents are magical (some will say that having a Squib parent makes you a half-blood, while I personally believe that it depends), then you're a pureblood. However, you would be a "new" pureblood, and since your family isn't old or very pure, you would be looked down upon. However, you would be more respected than a Muggleborn or someone whose parents were Muggleborns or who is a half-blood via a Muggleborn and a Muggle or a Muggleborn and a Squib.

The purer your blood, the more respected you are. If your parents are purebloods, then you're higher than pretty much everyone else. If one of your parents was a pureblood and the other a half-blood, then you're less respected than a pureblood but more respected than everyone else. If one of your parents was a pureblood and the other a Muggle or Muggleborn, then you're less respected than a half-blood with at least three magical grandparents.

Take Tracey Davis and Harry Potter, for example. They're around the same type of purity since one of their parents is a pureblood and the other is not. However, Harry is generally "better" than Davis because he's popular. Now take Seamus Finnigan, for example. His mum is a witch and his father is a Muggle. He would be less respected than Davis or Harry because he's got Muggle blood in him. Hermione would be seen as even worse than him simply because both of her parents are Muggles.

In Harry Potter (fanfiction, at least), who your parents are matters. Or, shall I say, /what/ your parents are matters. Old purebloods rank higher than "newer" purebloods, newer purebloods rank higher than most half-bloods, half-bloods rank higher than Muggleborns, and (it depends), Muggleborns rank higher than Squibs.

Depending on the fanfiction, having creature blood will have you be looked down upon while in others, it is generally accepted that all of the "old families" have some creature blood in them. Like the Malfoys being part Veela (since they're french) or the Zabinis being part vampire. The only unaccepted "creature" blood to have if werewolf blood, and that's mostly agreed upon by the purebloods or anyone who doesn't live in the "slums" aka Knockturn.

As far as I'm aware, it's worse to be a werewolf than it is to be a Muggleborn.
