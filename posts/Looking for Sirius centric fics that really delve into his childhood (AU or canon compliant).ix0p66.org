** Not Sirius centric, but in linkao3(The Heir Of House Black) Harry reincarnates as Sirius's older brother, so there's a bunch of Black family drama. There's also it's direct inspiration; linkffn(Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is).

  It was the year 2003 and Wizarding Britain was finally starting to heal from the wounds of the Second Wizarding War. However, a growing number of Dark wizarding activities across Europe and political impasse in the Wizengamot threatened to destroy the fragile society once and for all. But who was the enemy? Was it just the remnant supporters of Voldemort or was it the rise of a new Dark Lord? 23-year-old Deputy Head Auror Harry Potter tried to get to the bottom of this mystery but there was simply not enough time. There was simply nothing he could do to save the world at this point... Unless he could go back in time and stem the tides... This is a journey of family, of friendship, of self-discovery, and, as always with Harry Potter, a healthy dose of world-saving.(Master of Death Harry Potter/ Rebirth/ Time Travel Fix-It/ Marauders Era)Updates once every two weeks. Inspired by Tsume Yuki's "Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is" and with her expressed permission, this is the author's fiction re-imagined.Link: [https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10610076/1/Time-to-Put-Your-Galleons-Where-Your-Mouth-Is]

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)

They're often from characters like Remus or Regulus's perspective, but they go very in depth into Sirius's childhood.

  It's the summer after fifth year, and Sirius has made himself scarce as usual. But then Remus catches a glimpse of him in Witch Weekly's special on the Black-Malfoy wedding. Something about that photo is very, very off... Turns out this is the summer Sirius runs away. Or tries to. Because the Blacks are not giving up on their heir without a fight.

  "We don't drown. We float. That's how Muggles used to tell, isn't it?"-When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost.It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything.(A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)[Edit: SPOILERS in the comments.]

** These two start quite late, I believe he's 16 in both, but there's a lot of interesting ideas about what growing up in Grimmauld Pl might have been like for him. They are very well-written and have great plot and are more or less canon compliant. As a head's up, he's written as bisexual in the first one and gay in the second one.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19900360/chapters/47135293?view_adult=true]]) Anthem for Doomed Youth is a very detailed and both raw and funny coming-of-age story of the Marauders, with at least 1/4 about Sirius, lots about his homelife and how it shaped him befor and after he runs away from home.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12540852/chapters/28558256]]) They're Hiding Inside Me is about how and why he runs away from home, and if I remember correctly it's from Remus's point of view even though it's definitely a story about Sirius.

  James celebrates Christmas by drugging himself on powdered thestral-hoof (as a joke), Remus visits Madagascar (it's sunny and it brings out his freckles), Peter takes up smoking (and quits), and Sirius flat-out refuses to read Nature's Nobility ever again (he would also like to make it clear that he detests the Christmas decorations in Grimmauld Place).  This version of events takes place from December 1975 to April 1976. There were some animals hurt in the telling of this story, but the boys would like to ensure you that the Giant Squid isn't one of them.
