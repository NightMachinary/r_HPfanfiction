:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember reading this fic a while ago where Harry taught himself to use wandless magic (possibly under the tutelage of his scar horcrux, but maybe not). However, in this world, wandless magic was considered a very dangerous branch of accidental magic; the example given was a girl who tried to bring her cat back from the dead but it turned into an Inferius and her magic burned her up and killed her. I think Filch referred to people who were killed this way as “candles”.

If anyone can point me to this fic, I'd really appreciate it! Thanks.


** Not exactly the same, but I do remember one fic where harry tries to go all indy and dumbledore takes him to see the ministry-run school in diagon alley and sees that everyone is drugged to their gills on emotional suppressants because accidental magic is /dangerous/ and frequently lethal as the child gets older and teenage hormones kick in. And even with the suppressants sometimes students go pop and there's really nothing anyone can do about it.

Hogwarts is one of the premiere magic schools in the world because of unreplicatable anti-accidental magic spells woven into the castle. Hogwarts is one of the few places on earth where accidental magic simply /doesn't happen./ And thus the students can be human before they become fully qualified wizards who can control their accidental magic.

**** hopefully someone else can find it because the only thing unique enough that I remember that could be used to find it is "it's on fanfiction.net"

It's been ages since I read it, so it's probably at least 5 years old.

***** I assume it's this one !linkffn(8643565)

Mass effect crossover, and that scene plays a very minor role in the story, but that exact scene almost exactly in chapter 17 (18 ffn style). Either that or that explanation was inspired by something else.

Beg my pardon. I clearly am clueless regarding the bot: Story: Blue Magic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8643565/18/18]]

*** I don't know a fic where this happened with indy!Harry, but there is a crossover fic with Mass Effect, where Dumbledore shows Liara a ministry run school. I think it hasn't got an update in long while and I'm not even sure that the reason he shows it to her is the same, but this comment slightly reminded me of that. I think it was called something along the lines of "Blue Magic"

**** You know, that might have been it. The fic was so unmemorable except that one little tidbit I couldn't remember the exact reason why it was shown, just that it was triggered by disgust at something dumbledore was doing -- which naturally lead me to think it was indy harry.

**** Just finished reading through, it's implied by Dumbledore in the last posted chapter that the horcrux is more active than in canon, so understandable that aspect would also stick in your mind.

God, that kitten scene pulled at my heartstrings. Damn.

EDIT: also just noticed that this was from four days ago, sooooo, sorry for the ping!

** No idea which fic that is, but I would suggest that the danger wasn't so much from the wandless aspect as it was from the /necromancy/. If you play with fire and burn your house down, it doesn't make a great deal of difference whether you used matches or a lighter.
