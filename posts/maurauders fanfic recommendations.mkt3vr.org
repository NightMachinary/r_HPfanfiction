**** I know! I'm a bit behind on the sequel, (a couple of chapters) but I also just really like love the description for the sequel? which sounds weird, but idk.

/"They deserved a few more years of fun but the world just had other plans for them. At some point, they keep waking up but it never feels any better. All they can do is hold out hope."/

It just seems really sad to me but also oddly happy?

***** Funnily enough I'm also a bit behind. Not sure where I am exactly though.

Wow yeah the description is really interesting! I don't usually read the description more than once but it's actually really good now that you point it out.

Something about the writing style itself is just so beautiful too.

** I like these myself. The first one isn't quite finished and the other two center on just one year. They are all a bit more explicit than lost generation, can't quite remember what ratings atyd has.

  “The Marauders aren't something that will just go away once we graduate.” James continued, taking a more serious tone and addressing not only Remus, but the fear that they all had found recently in the back of their minds about what may become of them outside the walls of Hogwarts. “We're a family. We've proven that again and again, haven't we? We're forever. Unstoppable. We're infinite.”The full story of The Marauders from September 1st 1971 - October 31st 1981. (Heavily centered around Wolfstar and Jily in later chapter)

  James celebrates Christmas by drugging himself on powdered thestral-hoof (as a joke), Remus visits Madagascar (it's sunny and it brings out his freckles), Peter takes up smoking (and quits), and Sirius flat-out refuses to read Nature's Nobility ever again (he would also like to make it clear that he detests the Christmas decorations in Grimmauld Place).  This version of events takes place from December 1975 to April 1976. There were some animals hurt in the telling of this story, but the boys would like to ensure you that the Giant Squid isn't one of them.

  While war brews on the horizon beyond the walls of Hogwarts, the infamous Triwizard Tournament resurfaces just in time for the Marauders' seventh year. When the students of Beauxbatons Academy and Ilvermorny School arrive, the champions are in for three unprecedented challenges. Meanwhile, Remus still has feelings, James is still trying to get the (Head) girl, and Sirius has revelations.

** linkao3(1971)

This isn't one I see recommended often. It's a very different take on the marauders but I found it extremely interesting.

It's not that similar to atyd so you might not like it but I thought I might as well recommend it anyway.

It's eventual WolfStar. Only the first 7 chapters are on AO3 but if you check the comments on the last chapter you can find a link to the rest.

** My first thought when reading this was [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24620707/chapters/59480275][*The Last Enemy: The Howling Nights*]] *by CH_Darling.* The Howling Nights is the first story in a new canon-compliant Marauders era series that starts in their Fifth Year and will go through the end of the First War. It is EXCELLENT, and surpasses all the old standbys of this genre in my opinion. Obviously, the main pairing is Jily, though I'd argue that it's more gen than anything and it will also have minor messy Wolfstar later in the series. It's written from multiple POVs, and it's very clear how much effort and thought CH put into mining every detail she could from canon to figure out their characterizations. The Black family dynamics are especially strong, and Lily is just as flawed and compelling as everyone else. The Whomping Willow incident and aftermath were beautifully written. I also really loved how she wrote the whole process of the boys becoming animagi, and it provides some of the best humor in the story. CH fully writes each fic and does at least one round of edits before she starts posting, so the plotting is tight and consistent. Basically, 10/10 highly recommend! Check out the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRpsSodszhY][trailer]] she made too. CH said that she will begin posting the second installment in June.
