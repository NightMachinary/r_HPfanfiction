Well the question has been asked. I ask it here because I am looking into fanfiction about magical creatures. So what is your favorite magical creature in Harry Potter? Was the reason it is your favorite come from the books or a fic? Mine is a tie between the Basilisk and Phoenixes. Phoenixes are some of the most amazing creatures in the books, and Basilisks are the ultimate killing machines. You face a basilisk, you live by luck, and being kind to a phoenix.


** I like how gnomes are just little shits and to get rid of them you just chuck them as far as you can to make them dizzy and lost. It's a hilarious visual.

** Dementors and Inferi.

Dementors for the mere fact that nobody really knows where they come from, how to kill them, what they are. Positive emotion (channeled into a Patronus) just keeps them away and... well, maybe keeps them from breeding.

Then they're the wardens of freakin Azkaban. Hell on earth. I like them so much because they could be straight out of Dantes Inferno or the Testament of Solomon.

Inferi because I like Zombies and they're the epitome of what the "standard" zombie should be. Mindless, soulless bodies that are out for your brains (and the rest of your body). Relatively harmless alone, absolutely deadly in masses.

** I think Thestrals are by far the most interesting creatures. You can only see them if you've seen death? Seems so specific, I'd love to know the reason for such behaviour - I know this is fantasy, but either an evolutionary reason (that they evolved that way for some reason) or a magical reason (that they were enchanted by someone for a reason) would be intriguing to explore.

Also, apparently the Elder Wand wand core is a Thestral tail hair, which makes them even more interesting.

*** I like Thestrals too! I've always pictured that when someone dies, Death comes and collects their soul. Every time. So Death just travels around santa-like, and while nobody is capable of seeing Him, He is still present in the world. When He collects the newly deceased, His presence is enough to have a lasting impact on the magic of those that were close enough to witness the event. The proximity of such a supernatural entity changes people's magic slightly, in a way that Thestrals become visible. I've also head-canoned that Thestrals are the Mounts for the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse; War, Famine, Conquest, and Death. Which is why seeing Death would somehow change you to be able to see wild Thestrals- it'd just be ridiculous to see War riding around seated on an invisible mount of some kind.

*** i think jk said you have to 'understand' death, so perhaps they are always invisible to other animals. it's just a quirk of their magical evoloution.

they're my favourite by far. i like that they can fly you anywhere with just an address. it's hard to imagine the flying horses even understand what an address is.

*** Ugh. I tired of the way the Basilisk is often portrayed in fanfics. That Harry goes down and has conversations with it, and it is a good creature, blah blah blah. It is a *dark* XXXXX creature. It is evil and wants to kill, by its own very nature.

**** Well, that's debatable. After all, the X ratings are danger to wizards, and doesn't take into account Parselmouths.

In addition, it is possible the Chamber Basilisk was a pet to Salazar, or maybe just a chained guard dog. This has implications for its behaviour and possible personality.

Next, snakes in Harry Potter have shown to have intelligence - they must, if humans can talk to them. Is it possible that a parselmouth actually injects the snakes with magic to give them artificial intelligence? Possible. Is it possible that snakes actually just have intelligence and self-awareness? Also possible. What this says for the rest of the animal kingdom is also a massive question. However, it is impossible to know anything for certain.

However, it is also quite possible, and it seems to be indicated, that the basilisk is crazy. It's been a thousand years, even in hibernation. Ultimately, we cannot know. If circumstances were different, it might very well be the case that you could have conversations with it. Good/dark/evil doesn't mean anything to an animal.

The Ministry rating system only tracks danger levels, not ethical outlook. The Basilisk is a terrible and dangerous monster, but I'm not sure it's Good or Evil in a recognizably human way.

**** I think you're wrong. The basilisk can kill just by looking at people. Not to mention its venom, or simple tearing them apart or swallowing them alive. Yet in both times it is released into the school it only manages to kill one person, and that was because she was looking at the tap when it came up from the chamber.

'Luck' 'Fate' ... Maybe, but I've always thought that the basilisk was being ordered to attack muggleborns, and did so in a way that caused as little harm as possible. Tom Riddle was the evil one, not the snake.

** I'm a little surprised nobody has mentioned centaurs, giants, or goblins (and possibly Veela and leprechauns). I find it fascinating to think about these other creatures at least as intelligent as humans but refusing to be subjugated by them. They have their own social organizations and negotiate with wizards, rebelling if terms are not acceptable to them. They show themselves to be the equals of wizards, and the implications of that are huge. No other non-human creatures seem to do this. Werewolves and vampires are just cursed/enhanced humans, so it's natural that they would have the same demands for rights, even if these are not granted. The very concept of humanity in HP is greatly expanded, and yet the ordinary wizard acts much the same as the Muggles do regarding other species. They set themselves as the standard and attempt to control or regulate the others.

Basilisks and phoenixes are badass and all, but ultimately they're shown to be servants of wizards. Also I love Dementors a lot (they scared the crap out of me when I was younger), but they seem like intelligent plants to me, even though they have language. (Dementor plants. I want a garden with Dementor's Kiss planted next to baby's breath. It sounds so cute!)

** I really like this question. Magical creatures were one of the things Rowling did so, so right - almost everything alive in the world we run into is bizarre and incredible or entertaining, from flobberworms to mandrakes to kneazles.

I'm really enjoying everyone's responses to this - it's quite inspiring.

** I can't remember if these were ever mentioned in the actual books if if they're only found in "Fantastic Beasts...", but I like chizpurfles. Not only do they attack magical items, but they also will attack muggle items that are powered by electricity.

Whenever any of my electrical stuff breaks or goes haywire, I blame it on chizpurfle infestation. If someone else hears me and gets it, then I'll have found a new best friend.
