** That always felt like a horrible plot-crutch to me: Harry knew at least for a year about the /Mobilicorpus/ charm, so if he was not able to perform it himself, the most rational thing to do would be to ask Krum to do it, and transport Crouch Sr. to the Hospital Wing, and /then/ ask Dumbledore to check on him.

*** There's always the fact that, in situations of panic, people don't always think clearly. But there's also the possibility that, between Harry and Krum, they could've just lugged the man into the grounds.

**** Well, one major quality of Harry seems to be (even canonically) ability to think clearly in the situation of panic. It would be quite OOC for him to loose his head.

Only when it's convenient plot-wise. Remember the inferi in the lake?

****** That's a bit unfair. No matter how clearheaded you are, I'm pretty sure you lose your shit when you are stuck on a tiny island with your mentor whom you thought was unbeatable dying next to you while hundreds of zombies try to drag you underwater.

******* This is the same guy who didn't lose his head while fighting a gigantic ass snake at the tender age of 12 years old, and got cornered by an army of dementors (his biggest fear). The guy who kept his head while surrounded by Voldy and a shitload of death eaters. The guy who faced a dragon. All without panicking.

No, I don't buy that the inferi were too much for him to handle without panicking, it's just that his characterization (pretty much all characters' in Harry Potter) bends depending on the needs of the plot.

******** Everything could be justified by the fact that Rowling was not always consistent with her writing but if you want to make an imagination exercise out of it, here's my take on the situations: Harry was pretty panicked when he got attacked by the Basilisk, it was Fawkes's song that gave him courage; Harry pretty much lost his head when the Dementors attacked him, in fact so much so that even while hiding in the bushes he would have allowed his past self to be kissed only in the hopes that he'll see his father; again Harry was still quite scared, it was only in the end that he resolved that it was better to die fighting than hide behind a tombstone; the dragon was in a controlled environment and he had a plan.

***** True. But even clearheadedness under pressure doesn't rule out making a mistake, especially since Hogwarts is, supposedly, a very safe place, and Viktor Krum isn't exactly a pushover. IDK. I don't really know what to say there, you're absolutely right.

** I totally agree with you. I actually remember reading the book, being the same age as Harry was supposed to be and thinking "Duuuh, why not drag him to the hospital wing?" Even if they didn't know the magic to pull it off, big, burly and tough Victor Krum should have been able to help.
