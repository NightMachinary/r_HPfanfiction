I've never been a big fanfiction reader, but I'm really interested in reading about Voldemort's life before and at hogwarts, rise to power, first wizarding war and etc. from his point of view.

I don't know if there's anything like that out there but I figured this would be the best place to ask!! Thanks :)


** Harry Potter and the Seventh Horcrux is a great one that portrays Tom as having his soul sucked into Potter's body. So funny.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8706297/1/Professor-Riddle-and-the-Quest-for-Tenure][Professor Riddle and the Quest for Tenure]]: More than two decades ago, Headmaster Dippet made the fateful decision to hire Tom Riddle as an associate Hogwarts professor. And now, at last, Riddle's double life as Lord Voldemort is threatening to bring the Wizarding World to its knees...if only he can convince his students to leave him alone.

Basically, a smart canon Voldemort rising to power from within a position as Professor. Has some vaguely crackish elements, and quite short, but what's there is very good, IMO.

** Neither of these is quite what you're after, though both are told through Tom Riddle's/Voldemort's POV:

[[http://sam-storyteller.dreamwidth.org/97242.html][Reclamation]] by Sam Storyteller, an outstanding "alternative universe" (AU) story where Tom Riddle chose a different path, becoming the Defense against the Dark Arts professor at Hogwarts instead of the Dark Lord Voldemort.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8892557/1/The-Chronicles-of-the-Dark-Lord-Ginnymort][The Chronicles of the Dark Lord Ginnymort]] by Respitechristopher is another AU story from Voldemort's POV starting after he successfully possessed Ginny in /HP and the Chamber of Secrets/.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6939995/1/The_Crown_of_Metis][The Crown of Metis]]: /1957 A tree in Albania, she said. Straightforward enough, right? Not if someone else got there first. Tom's journey in acquiring the vessel for his fifth Horcrux just got that much trickier. An exploration of White Magic. Canon-compliant. Longshot. OC/

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/505654/1/][The Broken Victory]]: /What drove Hogwarts' most brilliant student to become its greatest foe? Step into a mind that has failed to see past the darkness, and watch the chilling memories that were poured into Tom Riddle's diary resurface.../

The Broken Victory was written between 2001 and 2003 so it won't be completely canon compliant, can't remember the details but I think I liked it.
