Recommendations for fics that have a somewhat militaristic/government-involved teamwork sort of theme? As in, Harry joins up with a government force and gets training and they can throw their weight behind him. If Harry's overpowered/learns improbably quickly, that's fine.

Ideally, no post-DH "Harry as an Adult Auror" fics, I'm more interested in what's been done during the Hogwarts era.

Thinking of something like the raiding squads in Sunrise/Sunset over Britain, the Unspeakable teams in The Summer of Change, I'll even take something like the “Goblin-nation backed champion” nonsense like in Harry Crow (no teamwork there, but at least the government weight behind him is interesting). Less like the house teams in Hogwarts Battle School. As these probably imply, really tropey fics are fine for right now; it's just an interesting concept so I'll take what I can get.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
