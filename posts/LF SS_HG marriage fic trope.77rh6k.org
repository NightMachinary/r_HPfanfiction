Snape sends letter after receiving notice of match with Hermione. Hermione got her notice from Percy.

Patil sisters own a dress boutique in Hogsmeade. They make dresses for balls at Hogwarts.

Or is that a bunch of fics combined?


** I don't think I've read any one fic that quite combines /all/ of those things.

Could you give me a clue who he writes the letter to?

In linkffn(Care of Magical Creatures by Miamadwyn) Percy is involved with the ML and receives a letter from Hermione - but the match wasn't made for them, she chose Snape herself.

I believe I have read a fic where the Patil sisters have a boutique, but at the moment I can't recall much more than that a fic existed where that happened.

If you could give me more details, perhaps I could narrow it down in my memory...

*** Snape writes the letter to Hermione.

Percy is the one sending the letters from the ministry.

There's a few polygamous relationships (just remembered that) that Hermione could join.
