I've grown fond of soul bond stories, I'm looking for a longer harmione fic, being a soul bond fic would be a bonus but isn't absolutely necessary. Any help would be appreciated.


** linkffn(harry potter and the last chance by lequin) this is a soul bond fic though the focus isn't on the soul bond aspect. The fic is a time travel fix it based on reptilias challenge.

** Most of the soul-bond stories are horrible (how to get him and her to a bed without bother of dating and in very improper age), the most famous one I cannot even name here for the Rule 8 (“Ginny, thirteen years old, had an orgasm.”), but there are few exceptions.

- “Meaning of One, Part One: Stone and Fire” by Sovran linksiye(11833) and its sequels; bad robot! forgot linking to SIYE again: [[https://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=11833]]
- “The Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond” by Council linkffn(9818387) with absolutely awesome Dumbledore
- “Error of Soul” by Materia-Blade linkffn(8490518), which unfortunately ends exactly in the moment I would love it to continue, because it gets to really tough questions about pre-determined/arranged relationships and such. Pity.

  A Love Story that doesn't start with love. A Soul Bond that doesn't start with a kiss. Love is not handed out freely. Love is earned. When Harry and Ginny are Soul Bonded, they discover that love is not initially included, and that it's something that must be fought for. H/G SoulBond!RealisticDevelopment!EndOfCOS!GoodDumbledore! Trust me, you've never seen a soul-bond fic like this

  OOtP Mid Year. Every now and then throughout wizarding history, a pair of individuals very close to one another find that their magic has grown attached. A bond is formed. A Soul Bond. And may hell burn the idiot who ever thought having one was a 'good' thing! A Soul Bond story done 'right.' No bashing. A Harry and Hermione love and war story.
