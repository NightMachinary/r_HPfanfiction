There was a specific fic that I'm trying to find in which Harry becomes Ollivander's apprentice. I remember it culminating in [[/spoiler][Harry creating a 'masterwork' wand with a thunderbird feather in the middle of a storm]]

I'm interested in wandlore in general, though, so other suggestions are welcome, too!


** It's not the criteria in your spoiler, but I remember that Harry was his apprentice in one of Old Crow's stories.

** linkffn(11157943) /I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For/ Harry mentions learning wandlore from Ollivander after the War, mainly due to number of wands that families would give him. He also manages to make wands using materials from the Star Wars Galaxy, specifically Kashyyyk , which he finds has enough ambient Magic (It's a force nexus due to the sheer amount of life.) to produce wand-quality material.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.
