Let's find fics where the Dursleys' reputations are ruined due to their abuse of Harry.

Note I don't want excessive abuse (so Vernon doesn't tie Harry to the stairs and beat him) and no fics where Dumbledore and Weasleys are keeping him downtrodden.

#+begin_quote
  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.

*** I've read it, but I'm not that fond of heavily Hermione-centric fics.

But you did fulfill the request, so take an upvote.

**** Thanks, but don't worry about it being too much Hermione, it is certainly not a Harmony (that would be weird, when they grew up together).

***** I did read it before. It might not be Harry/Hermione, but it is about a step away from it.

There is also the whole name for Hermione's parents.

******* On the other hand, I quite enjoyed her role in A Dramatic Reading.

Best Hogwarts reads the books fic I've ever read.
