People give Dumbledore a lot of shit for the way house points were awarded first year, but honestly, I think he was perfectly justified. Yes, he planned the whole thing to give Gryffindor the house cup and give Neville a boost of confidence, but you know what? That's alright. Harry defeated the Dark Lord. The DARK LORD. The Lord-So-Dark-No-One-Speaks-His-Name. That lord. If I was running a school and one of my students killed a terrorist infiltrating the school, I'd give them the fucking cup. I might give them their own house and the house cup for the next 6 years. What Harry did was so much more important and impactful than the little things that the other houses did that Gryffindor deserved the cup, and if Dumbledore can help out Neville at the same time, well, that's just icing on the cake.


** It's not that he awarded the points, it's the WAY he awarded them. The other students have an incredibly warped version of the tale. (They did know about it, but not the extent of it as shown by Ron and Hermione's reactions to Harry's retelling. And remember, they were THERE for most of it.) To an outsider, Dumbledore's reasoning is shaky at best. I mean, 50 points for a game of chess? (I'm not discounting Ron's sacrifice, but Dumbledore awarding him all those points for being good at chess and not, say, being extremely brave and selfless in the face of danger both takes away from his accomplishments and alienates the people in other houses because it just looks like Dumbledore is making up reasons for Gryffindor to win.) Then there's the fact that Dumbledore awarded these points at the end of year feast, which seems to me extremely petty. Remember, some of these kids are ELEVEN. I would have been pretty upset if I thought I had won a big competition only for the win to be snatched from me at the last minute, after I was super happy that my team had won. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville definitely deserved those points. I'm not saying you're wrong about that. But Dumbledore could have handled it better and given them the points BEFORE the end of year feast, like he did in Chamber of Secrets.

TL;DR: The points were deserved, but Dumbledore should have awarded them before the feast.

** Awarding Harry is good but dumbledore did it in a way that made it seem like blatant favouritism at the same tome he encouraged reckless behaviour

It all works out in the end but if I was in one of the other houses and put in an effort in throughout the year to earn points and then at the end of the year someone is just handed the cup for nonsensical reasons like dumbledore came up with I would be pissed.

*** Yes. This. Also they got points for a situation that had nothing to do with gryffindor, and therefore should've recieved another award, and shouldn't have happened in the first place. The stone shouldn't have been anywhere near Hogwarts and Harry shouldn't have had to face Voldemort.

**** Terribly sorry, don't know what happened. I'll put this here for anyone interested.

  Thing is, that wasn't Gryffindor house as a whole, that was just Harry. In those circumstances he should have been awarded the trophy for special services to the school. And on top of that, Dumbledore should have given the points once he found out what happened, so the other houses had a chance of catching up. To be given points after the cup has been awarded is just cruel to the house that had won.

** Half of the problem was the presentation, it was incredibly hurtful to all the Slytherins(most of which were innocent) and some could even say, ALL the other Houses, the damn Hall was already decorated, he could've just awarded the victory points to the Trio and Neville and then given a special services award to Harry, all this with blank flags so the Slytherins don't feel cheated because the Headmaster favors the local celebrity.

For those not in the know, it just seemed like the Headmaster was strongarming the Cup to Gryffindor.

They still got points shoved up their ass by Snape for doing nothing at all.

The way Dumbledore does things isn't good, but if he did thing properly, Slytherin would be dead last all the time. The "you're next, mudbloods" alone would be enough to reset their points to 0 in year 2, especially since no one called him out on it. Or their cooperation with Umbridge (almost all named Slytherins were in the Inquisition Squad), or Malfoy committing war crimes in HBP (perfidy was enough to warrant execution by the allies, so - how many points does that amount to?).

I agree with that, I would have certainly punished them and specially Draco, severely.

But we don't know if Snape does the point thing ALL the time or just when Harry and Co. are around because he sees then as the New Marauders, the way Dumbledore did it, he looked just as bad as Snape, but in the front of whole school, and the part where the Banners change is the worst.

It does give some validation to the fics where Slytherins see themselves as unfavored by Dumbledore.

Even if it's just around Harry, what we see alone is enough to screw over the entire system.

** The main problem I have with that scene is not that Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville get enough points to beat Slytherin, it's more the way it's presented. They get the points awarded after Dumbledore has already announced that Slytherin won. The way it's presented the message Dumbledore is "Yes, well done Slytherin...SIKE, Gryffindor wins, get fucked, idiots!"

** It basically levels out Snape, even then the griffindors lost 150 due to the dragon incident.
