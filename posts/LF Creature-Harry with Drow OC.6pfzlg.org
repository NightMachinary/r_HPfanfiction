I remember reading a fic on FFnet once that had Harry "coming into his inheritance" (which means turning into some sort of half snake creature?) some time between his fourth and sixth year I think (can't remember which but he was a teenager). And it happened gradually at the Dursleys, freaking him out...

He then somehow ended up either in Knockturn Alley or some other Alley (I'm not sure if this was a fic where next to Diagon Alley and Knockturn Alley many more alleys existed or if I'm confusing something). Anyway, there was a hotel, led by vampires I think, specifically for non-humans, and besides some vampires there was a male Drow (all OCs) and I believe this guy was supposed to be Harry's love interest. And later Harry found out through research that he was probably some sort of Naga or Lamia or something, I believe.

It was a series I think, with the first fic being completed and the second in progress. The names could have included something with Silver and/or Serpent, but... I can't remember at all, and I cannot find it anymore, neither on FFnet nor on Google.

Does anyone have an idea what it could be and what might have happened with it? Maybe it's still available on another site or something...? Thanks in advance!
