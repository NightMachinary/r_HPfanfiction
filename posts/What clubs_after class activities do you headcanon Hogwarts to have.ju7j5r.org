I'm interested in hearing about what people have added to the universe in their fics or what they think would be interesting to read about! I know about the canon like quidditch, dueling clubs, and the slug club, but I wish cannon had delved more into the world-building. Maybe a club to tinker with muggle technology and that's what had lead to Arthur's interest?

Edit: spelling error


** Hogwarts explorers - go exploring Hogwarts and all its mysteries. Senior members may add a few mysteries as well. Secret passage between the Great Lake and the forbidden forest? Enterprising upper year needed an alibi to go exploring the forest.

**** I imagine that the map wouldn't have the more recent routes unless the twins figured out how to update it. It would make it a much less infallible plot device.

*** There was a fic where Harry brought some board games like Battleship and Cluedo and cards with him to Hogwarts and then started a club. This Harry grew up with a tabletop RPG group composed of adults that regularly met at a comic book store. D&D didn't flourish because it was hard to reconcile what they were learning with the D&D magic system but another game did. I forgot what it was, though.

Those ideas were some of the light hearted moments in the fic. It was still a pretty weird fic, though, because for some reason Harry eventually became a mercenary.

** An illegal frog fighting ring where older years make bets on whose pet frog would win. Used to be pretty popular prior to 1991, when Neville Longbottom came to Hogwarts with his pet Bullfrog Trevor who proceded to beat and sometimes eat up all the competing frogs, ending competition and causing the ring to close.

** The obvious ones of course - duelling club, chess club, gobstones club, potions club, herbology club etc.

But I always felt there should be more - it's a thousand(according to JKR) of kids with magical abilities in a castle, so I think the teachers would make sure there are plenty things for the kids to do in the free time.

I like the idea of:

Art Club - Photography, painting and some weird instruments. Maybe those with more experience could help renovate portraits in the castle?

Something where the kids could learn about the Wizarding World and culture - traditions, celebrations, important events, and other things they should know. I feel this could be something really useful for muggleborns.

A discussion club, where the students could debate over recent events happening in the wizarding world.

Hogwarts Newspaper.

I also love your idea about tinkering with muggle technology.

Edit: Okay, I remembered about a brilliant fic:

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16375733/chapters/38325272]])

There's a group of people (called "The Ravenclaw Rebellion"), and they meet up from time to time to solve puzzles, riddles and doing stuff like that. When I read the fic, I thought something like this should exist at Hogwarts. A club that would challenge your knowledge about various branches of magic, where you could have fun and also learn new things.

** You know what, I recently got disturbed by how little entertainment the kids talk about in Harry Potter.

And they don't really have that much hobby.

The teens we know best don't really have favorite bands, nor books author, nor magazines, nor favorite show on the Wizarding Wireless Network. Nothing like muggle teens are passionate and obsessed about.

Ron has his favorite Quidditch team, but that's about it. The Weird Sisters band is mentionned as being popular, but you don't really feel it.

It's weird. It's like JKR forgot that one of the big part of being a teenager is exploring your own tastes and interests in arts, hobbies, entertainments and culture.

And so, we lack a lot of worlbuilding on those topic.

Back on what you ask, I like to imagine the followings :

- They have game nights. They play exploding snaps, and other wizarding games (that we have yet to imagine), all in good spirits. No competition or anything. Everyone welcomes.

- There's various bands forming and exploding in Hogwarts. They practice in empty classrooms. People tends to avoid those part of the castle when the kids are practicing. Very few are actually good.

- There's a choir, as implied in the movie.

- A writing club, of course. They imagine fictionnal stories. Both for books. But also plays and series as if they'd be broadcast on the WWN.

- While not an official club or activity, I'm convinced that there are football pick up games on week-end.

I know they have Quidditch, and all that magic, but I can't imagine that a british muggleborn would swear-off football for 9 months in a row.

(Harry even participated from time to time. Not that he loves the sports, but they had an uneven number, and Harry was muggle-raised, so at least he knows how to play football. He is a fine stricker when he wants to be).

*** I feel exactly the same about JKRs world building! I know the wizarding world is substantially smaller than the muggle world, but your idea of talking about bands forming makes me wonder about subcultures. Not all students forming bands have the same taste in music, right? I feel like the movies also exacerbate the problem by presenting almost a uniformity in how the kids style themselves in and out of school robes. Like there had to have been goth group of students forming an 80s alt band or muggleborns in the 90s introducing hiphop to their friends. You've really inspired me!

** As well as there being few canon hobbies, there seem to be very few facilities for students. There is no shared common room for all houses which is a major omission - if you have nowhere to socialise with people from other houses, how are you meant to get to know them? Also no school shop or cafe. What do students do if they want to buy sweets or any clothing or books or spare quills or whatever? The first and second years can't even leave school grounds. Activities outside of lessons and meals in canon seem to consist of watching the odd quidditch match, going to Hogsmeade a couple of days a term for the 3rd-7th years, sitting around in the common room and (weather permitting) taking walks outside. That doesn't seem much to keep the average person entertained.

** Choir and orchestra

Ballroom dancing in some capacity

Photography or art club

And of course the standard stuff:

Gobstones, chess, charms, potions, herbology,

recreational cross houses quidditch for the kids not on house teams (probably just a reserved and supervised time slot for the quidditch pitch),

football (because Britain, duh).

Additionally there's probably some clubs that exist for a few years before their popularity fizzles out again, like knitting, climbing, divination, hogwarts explorers, student newspaper, swimming, electronics, ...

Dueling club and the DA would fall under the same category.
