Does anyone know any good ones? The only one i have read that has this is Delenda Est, and there it isn't really a big part.

No Slash please


** Damn, you got me at no slash. If you can look past the slash, [[http://trickster.org/res/transfig.html][Transfigurations]] is pretty damn good. Sorry it doesn't quite fit your request, I figured something was more helpful than nothing.

** I just read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3675262/1/Stupid]["Stupid"]] last night. Harry being a teacher isn't the main part, but he does become one (after retiring from quidditch)

Harry is straight, but there's some slashy action in the background.

** Deadwoodpecker's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4464089/1/Yellow-Submarine][Yellow Submarine]] has it as a major plot element. 185k words, abandoned. Warning: some pretty disturbing stuff in it w.r.t. Ginny's captivity.

  Alternate Universe. Two hurting, almost broken people reach toward the sunlight. This story has implied sexual violence and a Ginny who is two years younger than she was in canon.
