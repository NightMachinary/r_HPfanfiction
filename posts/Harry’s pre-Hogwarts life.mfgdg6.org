Hi! I have been rereading the series as an adult and holy smokes the child abuse is insane. Podcasts address this but I've not been able to find a fanfic that accurately portrays this. Any fanfic that addresses the Dursley's at all is like.. insane. Like they are either perfect or they are literally torturing him and killing his owl. Are there any fanfics that are canon compliant and address how freakin abusive the Dursley's were without devolving into some crazy bdsm torture thing? I mean, in canon... there must me some time that he opens up to hermione or Ron or Sirius or lupin about what his childhood was like? I'm just in my rereading thinking like... fuck, hermione must have asked questions when he was doing patronus lessons with lupin or detention with umbridge. So anyone have any good fics along those lines?


** I love these kinds of fics:

  Hello journal. Today we have a prompt. Our prompt is our favrit family tradition. I do not have a favrit family tradition because I do not have a family. Signed, Harry Potter.

  Harry Potter's third form journal. A peek at pre-Hogwarts life.
#+end_quote

This fic is written in the form of Harry's journal entries, with a sort-of Outsider POV in the form of Harry's teacher, who reads these entries and provides feedback and things. Harry's entries are really realistic as he actually sounds/writes like an 8 year old boy. Most of the fic is just Harry's responses to the prompts given to him, but there are a few chapters that are written specifically in the POV of the teacher. One chapter even deals with the whole Harry-teleporting-onto-the-roof fiasco.

The fic is still a WIP, but ends at a note that feels complete.

** I've read a few that I can't remember the names of where the Dursleys just make him do chores and underfeed him, with the occasional swat to the back of the head, but his childhood wasn't the focus
