Ok so it has been a long time since i was obsessed with Dramione fics.....4 years to be precise. At that time, i stumbled upon a fic. It wasn't complete and there were not many chapters in that fic then and the plot was just building, so I sort of lost interest at some point and now i suddenly remember that i want to know the end.Ii don't remember the name of that fanfic nor do i know the name of the author, so i just need a little help finding it. I do remember a bit of the plot though. It was dramione and a side pairing of Blaize and Ginny (didn't happen when i was reading). It took place in their 6th year when Draco was given the task of killing Dumbledore. But, apparently he was distracted by Hermione so the death eaters had a back up plan and told Theodore Nott (not sure) to complete that task if Draco failed. That is all I remember. If someone can help me find it I would be grateful. And if not, I will simply accept that the story no longer exist.
