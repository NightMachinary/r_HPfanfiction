In it, Wizards were very rare and sperm was very valuable. Harry had to give sperm to the school and he got help by the teachers. In one chapter, Narcissa Malfoy paid him to have Sex.

It was my favorite sorry and it would mean much to me, if you could help me find it.


** That sounds like Witches World by Dasteiza or Dastelza, it's on AO3.

*** What happened to Dasteiza anyway? I had a couple stories from them that I was following, but it's like their account was wiped. I can still see their bookmarks, but not any of their works. I know that they are on Patreon, but I don't want to pay for something that I could get on a public website for free.

***** I am logged in, and even double checked, because sometimes I think that I am logged in, but am not. But when I go to my history, and go back to the last time I read one of their works, there is a red lock next to the author's name. I don't really know what that means, but I do know that a blue lock means that it is accessible to logged in users only. Is it safe to assume that the red lock means something similar?

** It also could be the one where they are finding hermione's parents in AUS and the AUS government kidnaps ron cause they want his pureblood baby batter and by they I mean umbridges cousin who devises this evil plan to bring back the purebloods and its super strange seeing all these pureblood elitists fawn over ron because everyone in AUS is sterile. Even hermione has to stake claim on harry and hit the other women who are begging for harrys children. Its kinda strangely awesome, but incomplete iirc
