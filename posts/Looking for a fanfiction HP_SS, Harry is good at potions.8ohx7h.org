I remember reading a story that I can't find anymore. It started with Snape realizing that Harry has some kind of talent in potions and Harry only sucked at potions because the recipes they follow in class are just simplified versions and because of his intuition (?) he wanted to do it differently. They get together, experiment together, go to conventions. Maybe mpreg? I don't remember.
