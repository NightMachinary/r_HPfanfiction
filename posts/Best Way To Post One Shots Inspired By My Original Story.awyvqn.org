I recently completed a story on FFN that was somewhat well received. I'm not interested in writing a sequel but I am toying with writing a few one-shots of missing moments and future moments foreshadowed in my story.

My question is this. Should I add these to the end of my current submission or set up a separate story on FFN and compile oneshots there? Just trying to figure out which way would be best to make sure the people who enjoyed my original story would know I have updated content. I'm leaning toward just adding to the end of the original story but would like the community's thoughts.


** I would set up the separate one shots on your ffn and maybe just add an A/N at the end of your last chapter of the completed work? This way people know where it is and it's easily searchable. What's the name of your story?

** I would actually prefer it at the end of the original fic, just put an author's note “chapter” between the fic end and the one shots to explain what's about to follow, then 1 one shot per chapter. I mostly read by app or downloading to PDF so it's loaded on my phone already that way, rather than having to click back to the author and then go into each individual one shot.
