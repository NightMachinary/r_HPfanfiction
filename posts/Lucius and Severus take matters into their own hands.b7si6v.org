So, I just found 'political expediency' by explopyro and I love it; really well written, snarky and sarcastic Lucius and Severus taking matters into their own hand and the fic does not insist on clinging to the good/evil binary. However... It is very clearly abandoned. (2 chapters, last updated in 2012)

Does anyone know of similar fics? I'm not particularly picky when it comes to pairings, it's all good.

Preferably no Molly or Ginny bashing though, as that very often seems to be rooted in blatant sexism.

Actually, bonus points if the show isn't completely run by male characters. (I find it hard to believe that women only worry and pick up the pieces without getting involved in politics, it's the only point I dislike in the fic I mentioned.)

Thanks!


** Linkffn(big name death Eater) is like that. I mean, it's got one of the best OC's I've ever read, Snape and the other death eaters being snarky bastards, and darts going very very wrong. Also Neville winds up winning the day in the best way possible

  Harry & Dudley flee an abusive Vernon to Severus Snape. Severus finds a new home for himself & the boys with dragons and hunt the Horcruxes from there. The dragons, especially one become their allies. Tom R is VERY different.

  A very AU Severus/Harry mentor fic with Lucius as a friend as well. Petunia dies and the Dursley's flee Privet Drive along with Harry. They end up hiding in an unexpected place when the Hogwarts letter arrives.
