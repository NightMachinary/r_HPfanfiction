So, I just had an idea for characterizing Neville into an unexpected badass. He uses farming magic - you know, 'cause he's got a green thumb. 'Ploughing charm' that causes devastating wounds on his opponents, 'chicken-neck wringing charm' that spins the target's head around until it pops off, 'insulation charm' that ends up causing heat stroke on creatures that generate heat, you get the idea.

It doesn't even have to be Neville. This idea could also apply to all the farmers that checked out of magical society.

Anyone know of any fics already doing this?


** I don't, but I'd prefer stuff like throwing Mimbulus Mimbletonia bulbs and having them grow and spew acid/ taming mandragoras to scream only when they're far enough away / generally more direct mastery of herbology rather than your standard violent spells with a vague farmery patina.

*** That's what I've normally come across whenever someone's gone with having neville use herbology in combat. The rest of the time it's just standard defense stuff. I just thought this was unusual and wanted to see if it was already out there

*** They were. At one point during the Battle of Hogwarts Neville and Professor Sprout were seen running to the battlements with earmuffs and potted mandrakes, and Neville said "mandrakes, going to throw them over the walls! That'll give them a nasty surprise!"

Assuming they were full grown (and thus have a lethal cry), Neville absolutely became a one man artillery crew and inflicted the kind of casualties you'd expect from an artillery battery.

*** The Cruciatus Curse was used to remove wheat from chaf? What? That doesn't make a lick of sense

** So whilst I haven't come across a fic, this heavily reminds me of a Korean Novel call Overgeared which has a character that was one of the candidates to be a legendary sword saint that becomes a legendary farmer who's very very OP and fights the actual sword saint candidate to a draw multiple times. The novel also contains the existence of a legendary blacksmith, miner and tailor.

In my head I would want to execute this as a crack!fic but this can definitely be done as a serious story.

I have been debating whether to grab the most interesting prompts I see and just write a few one shots all night so if I suddenly gain some energy to do the above your idea will be my first.

*** +Yeah, basically, but with more angry neville and disenfranchised rural folk subsisting just above the poverty line, and angry about it+

actually no it's not that at all. fucking read my post again - if you want to critique it, it'd help if you were accurate about what I was talking about.
