Looking for the most engaging, fun, and action-packed fics you can provide.

Over 70k+ words.


** I've been binge reading Divided and Entwined linkffn(11910994) the last week and I'm really enjoying it even though it's not something I'd usually read.

*** I honestly wished for a Trio pairing in this fic, but I'm OK with author's current choice.

I kind like the Voldemort in this story, and [[/spoiler][how he blew up Kingsley's force with a muggle bomb and planted the blame on the Resistance]]. I also like the way how the Ministry got slapped silly by both sides.

**** Yeah I like a lot about it, I like how it shows the blood purists views without trying to whitewash them. My only gripe with it is it sometimes feel like the authors too afraid kill off developed characters or let the resistance stumble at all. It's one of the few fics I've gotten invested in that a couple time's I've been like "oh shit oh shit something bads gonna happen to the resistance" and then they just make it out alive.

***** I expect them to suffer serious losses in next chapter though.

The next battle will probably be very ugly for both sides, but remain inconclusive, kind like the Battles of Verdun and Somme.

****** It's not that I'm afraid to kill off characters or have the Resistance suffer a setback. When I plot a battle, I don't go Doyle and say: "the Resistance needs a setback", I go Watson and ask myself: "what are the factions involved in this battle? What are their plans, their means, their goals?"

So far, having the Resistance suffering a serious setback (at least in the field - politically, they suffered such reverses several times, right from the start) simply wouldn't have made sense since they had had all the advantages. They've had time to plan carefully and prepare, usually pick at least the location, most often the time for a battle as well, and generally had initiative and surprise on their side. And they have mostly faced small Death Eater groups or the Ministry. And most importantly, Voldemort hasn't been able to find them or prepare for them.

That won't last, though.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** It's not finished, and it is probably the proto-type of the Peggy Sue Harry Potter fics, and by extent, the source for a great deal of the Super!Harry tropes (though notably to a generally reserved extent) but /Nightmares of Future Past/ is surprisingly gripping when one considers its age--pre-dating /Deathly Hallows/ itself. Also, over 400,000 words.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nightmares-of-Futures-Past]]

Do you like Luna? This story is her POV of /Order of the Phoenix./ I loved it, but it depends on how much you like Luna. Might be less than 70,000 but this is still a relatively long fic.

[[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2023&chapno=1]]

/Stages of Hope/ is a superb dimension-travel story. I dare not give anything away.

** linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom) It takes a while to really get going but it's still one of my favorite fics because I absolutely love the universe and the characters that it creates. At times it definitely feels like a never ending adventure with lots of action, humour and intriguing, intercepting plot lines.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
