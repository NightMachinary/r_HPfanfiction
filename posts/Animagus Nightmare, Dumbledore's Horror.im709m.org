Harry, under the tutelage of Dumbledore and McGonagall, finally achieves his animagus form.

And Dumbledore is horrified beyond belief.

Dumbledore, who had an adventure with the Doctor in the past, immediately recognizes what Harry is, and he actually panics: the horrors of the Last Great Time War left many a scar on many a person.

Unfortunately, even after forcing Harry back into his human form, dalek instincts remain, and those instincts are focused on Voldemort and his Death Eaters...
