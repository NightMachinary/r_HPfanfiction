I was very disappointed that the series never used the Chamber of Secrets except for the Basilisk, and the fight with Tom's soul.

I'd love if there were stories where the Chamber of Secrets is used more in the story. Perhaps it's a place where Harry and the others learn to fight? Perhaps it's a hideaway place for the students during the war? Perhaps it's a place to put potions or whatever?

I don't care how it's used, I'd just like the Chamber of Secrets to be used more in the story. Any rating is fine.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

** Didn't realize Cadmean Victory was already posted. If you're okay with Fem!Harry, linkffn(Iris Potter and the Goblet's Surprise)

It'll be used later on too, during the war and such.

  Iris Potter, the Girl-Who-Lived, gets thrown into the Tri-Wizard Tournament. Seeing the signs of a storm on the horizon, she sets herself on a new path. Featuring the beginning to a morally ambiguous and powerful fem!Harry, a new take on Ancient Runes, animagus transformations, five mostly unique tasks, and some humor. No bashing. First of a multi-part series.

**** This fic has a special place in my heart since I read it before I read the multitude of indi!harry fics that have been written so it stands out to me. This as well as it having one of my favorite pairings as well as doing a lot of the cliche bits a lot better that most fics puts it in my top 5.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

***** The problem with that is that I forget a lot of things over time so I can't simply just jump back in every 6 months when a new post appears. And I'm not sure, all I know is that plums last official bio update said that he teamed up with her but nothing came out of it I think.
