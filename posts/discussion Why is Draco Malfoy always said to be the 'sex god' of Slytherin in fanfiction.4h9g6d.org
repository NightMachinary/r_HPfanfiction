I see this almost always in fanfiction with him in it. Did I miss something in the books that implied that he was?


** Because Tom Felton is so hot!1!1!

** No, it's not about Tom Felton, or at least it didn't used to be.

It's a well established trope that has its roots in the dawn of the Harry Potter fandom. Cassandra Claire (yes, the same person who published the Mortal Instruments series), started writing the very influential series called the "Draco Trilogy" which essentially whitewashed Draco's character, in particular writing a scene where [Draco is in Leather Pants]([[http://www.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants][www.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants]]) and looking good in them. One must also not forget that Cassie and her Draco-loving clique were the "Big Name Fans" back in the day (we're talking 2000-2003 here) and thus they had the monopoly on which interpretation of his character was favoured, since fandom at that time was /very/ insular.

[[https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/ParadigmOfUncertainty/conversations/topics/2598][One fan even commented this]]: "Perhaps it is just due to the fact that we have /so many/ terrific, well-written, and thoroughly believable examples of fanfic here, but I'm beginning to get a little worried. I'm starting to worry that by the time JKR releases #5, we here in fanfic-land will have trouble distinguishing between JKR's Harry, Hermione, Ginny, et al. and Lori's/Cassie's. Especially difficult will be the readers' ability to see JKR's Draco the way JKR's Harry, Hermione and Ron see him - indisputably evil. We have already experienced Draco's transformation/redemption - will we be able to turn a blind eye to that? Or will we simply smirk knowingly?"

Since then, the Draco in Leather Pants trope has spawned thousands and thousands of fics and led to a massive fanon re-interpretation of his character. Though the attractiveness of Tom Felton is definitely playing a yuuuge role, it is not the original reason.

*** This is true. Sometimes I would forget if a certain scene was from the Trilogy, or from the actual books.

And I can't see Draco the same way anymore because of the Draco Trilogy. But I don't really mind, tbh.

We obviously read different fics.

** I think just because a lot of the people oriented towards boys like Tom Felton grew up watching the HP movies: they thought of his posh, arsehole self as the ideal evil boyfriend - nasty but good-looking on the outside, tragic and gentle on the inside.

I blame it on bad parenting.

** Yea its got to be based on the type of fics you read. In all the fics I have read hes described as exactly the opposite of a "sex god".

As others have said, hes not implied as one in the books, but between the actor playing Draco, and the idea that his family is a powerful player in the pureblood world, I think for certain type of Fan fics people paint him in that light. Plus there are a ton of Dramione fans out there (i personally dont get that pairing).

** While the fantastically short, funny answers of "Tom Felton" explain a lot, I think that there is another thing worth considering, a trope that I encounter a lot because my day job is writing, mostly writing romance. Anyway, that trope is:

*The bad boy.*

With every fandom, again and again, people wonder why certain pairings are popular. Especially, they wonder why asshole characters are so popular. In real life, these would be the guys you run away from not towards. So why?

There's more than one answer.

- Women don't get much opportunity in fiction to play the rescuing white knight, so saving someone from himself is as close as they often get. It's a way to be the hero but without a "super" needing to be attached. And an emotional rescue can be committed by anyone, so the female hero can be anyone.

- A lot of these stories involve the bad boy becoming, well, less bad. There is something magnificently appealing about the idea that love can redeem, and, more than that, that it can change a person. Or rather, that he changes himself. The jerk, the bully, the criminal, isn't cured by love but it is a catalyst for his betterment. This is wish-fulfillment at its finest. How often have you wished you could help someone when you see them heading down a dark path?

- Then you have the exact opposite of that, the good girl dragged down by the bad boy. This is a bit more complex in a psychological way, but the short version is that fiction is a safe place to play with darker themes. The reader is in control and can close the book or click out of the story at any time. It's dangerous, but it isn't /real/. (And with this type of story there tends to be a lot of BDSM-y undertones, especially ones that sub-oriented women readers might find appealing.)

As for why Draco Malfoy in particular is so popular, I believe there might also be another factor at work. JKR likes to talk a lot about how all the houses have their good points, but Slytherin consistently gets the short end of the stick in canon. There's good reason for that. The series is almost entirely seen from Harry's perspective, so we don't really get to Slytherin characters be ... you know, anything but generally shitty, petty, terrible people (who are often uglier than everyone else purely by coincidence).

Fanfiction likes to rectify that by showing them as less shitty. It's part of the reason Daphne Greengrass is so popular. In canon, she's a faceless cipher mentioned a grand total of maybe once, but in fanfiction she is a fleshed-out character and an exploration of what Slytherin characters are never shown to be in the books.

Well, except for Slughorn. But no one wants +their Hermione OC+ to bang him because he's old and fat and therefore worthless. Sort of like Peter Pettigrew. No one wants to write redemptive Pettigrew fics. Poor guy. He's so creepy and useless that not even fanfiction can whitewash him hot.

** I hail from the drarry fandom so this is something I've encountered a lot. It's one of the more annoying fanon headcanons, tbh. I have come across a few fics where it was done well but for the most part fics featuring sex god!Draco tend to be pretty bad.

As for the "why"...it's because 1) Tom Felton and 2) Top!Draco shippers.

** He belongs to the House of the sly and the amoral, is rich, well-connected (via his father), confident (usually unjustifiedly), comes from what can be interpreted (if you squint) as Wizarding aristocracy and has the (in)appropriate attitude, is played by a handsome actor, and has a general disposition of petty malice (which, if you squint, could be interpreted as power and dangerousness).

In other words, he is the closest thing HPverse has to the male protagonist from the /Twilight///50 Shades/ school of romance. As a result, he gets shoehorned into that role, with all the things that make him kind of pathetic in canon swept under the proverbial rug.

** The same reason he's said to be as smart as Hermione, the same reason he's said to bully characters cos he secretly wants to fuck them, the same reason why he's said to be always insanely overconfident with comebacks for centuries and the same reason why he's the most popular guy in all of Slytherin and everyone else is his bitch.

Cos many shippers are complete retards.

** Like with the other Malfoy questions, the answer boils down to fan-girls being emotionally retarded. Why is Draco Malfoy a sex god? Why, it's because teenage girls would gladly sell their souls to [[https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/ff/f4/d4/fff4d4f78dce2be62dc4bdc8b8b0480e.jpg][Tom Felton]].
