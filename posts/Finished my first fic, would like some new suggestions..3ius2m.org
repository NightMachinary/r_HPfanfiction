I just finished Six Years, Six Applicants. I loved it. I enjoyed that it was sort of in line with cannon, and the length was desirable.

I'm looking for something new to read. Another fic similar to this one (though the story can be completely different). Shorter, sort of true to canon, from a different perspective than Harry (not a Harry fan).

I'm a Slytherin, so I love that aspect too.

Thanks in advanced!


** Cauterize By Lady Altair\\
Very short (one shot) but is a good after war wrap up. Id recommend investing the ten minutes to read this.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

** *linkffn(Reign of the Serpent)*

It's wildly AU so might be a cool exploration of that for the first time. Primarily from the POV of Hermione, although Harry is a prominent side character along the lines of say...Draco? Or Neville maybe.

If you like Slytherin you'll love it cause it's the world if Slytherin had won and become immortal. Tom Riddle is the Headmaster and former leader of the feared Death Eater Squadron that fought against Grindlewald in an ongoing war in Europe and the Order of the Phoenix is an 'evil' rebellious group like the Death Eaters were in canon.

Oh and the houses are caste systems. Muggleborns have no caste unless risen to a higher one by the Ministry/Salazar.

It's really cool and is a WIP so if you like it I suggest making a fanfiction.net account to get update notifications.

*linkffn(The Snape Chronicles)*

Basically Snapes life. That's all there really is to say there. Really good but he's horrendously whitewashed and ever bad thing he does is somehow a total accident that isn't really his fault and the Marauders barely appear. Really well written though and the pre-Hogwarts years are great.

*linkffn(Against the Moon)*

Also a WIP, but wonderful. Again it's basically Remus' life and there's not much more to say there. IMO is far better than The Snape Chronicles, it's just as well written but makes everything much more realistic from what we know of canon.

*linkffn(Seventh Horcrux)*

Voldemort's horcrux takes complete control and Harry doesn't exist. The single funniest fic i've ever read. I'm actually rereading it now.

I'll also say this, not liking canon Harry doesn't mean you should never read Harry-centred fics, you'll miss out on a lot of amazing works that have Harry there in name but not spirit. Like Harry who's raised by Elves in *linkffn(fantastic elves and where to find them)* is not canon Harry by any stretch of the imagination. *linkffn(harry potter and the boy who lived)* involves Harry's family surviving including his brother, the boy who lived. Harry goes to Durmstrang in this and it's unbelievably good but Harry is basically an OC.

Hope one of these is enjoyable anyway. :)

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

** You mean you just do not like Harry as he was in the books, or you can't even stand the idea of reading a fanfic with him as the main character? Cause if the former is the case, you should know that there is an untold number of stories where with the right 'tweaks', Harry becomes a much better MC.

It is the polar opposite to what you requested. And it is written in first person. And it has some whinging... but it is done right. So very right. If you check just the first chapter you will see what I am talking about. Or maybe not and you will come back yelling at me. Who knows.
