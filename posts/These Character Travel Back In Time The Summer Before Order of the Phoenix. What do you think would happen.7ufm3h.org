** I have the following considerations:

- First, you gotta establish the time travel mechanism: Is it dimensional? In that case, the new dimension might have subtle or even major differences. Friends and enemies might be different. Horcrux locations might be different, or Horcruxes themselves might be different. Even the Halloween event might have played out differently.
- If the time travel is not dimensional, could time travelers affect the time line? What would happen to their old time line? If the time travel is Time Turner based, then they couldn't do basically anything without causing major bad things to themselves.
- Let's suppose the time travel is actually to a parallel dimension and the travelers have maximum freedom of actions, then you need to establish whether they arrived discreetly or publicly in front of everyone, because that would have huge implications on both what their friends and enemies would react.
- I personally would like to have them arrive in secret, so they could have some time and breathing space to explore their situation. It should also be interesting for readers to explore this new world along with the protagonists. When they discovered the first major discrepancies with their own world, they would inadvertently doubt about the validity of their 'advance knowledge'.
- As for what this new world contains, you could actually draw examples from notable AU fanfics: they might encounter Harrymort; they might face evil!manipulative!greaterGood!Dumbledore along with lovePotion!Ginny; they might encounter genius!resistanceLeader!Hermione; they might got hold of notEvil!Bellatrix Black; and they might find James and Lily alive.

--------------

But should they find themselves exactly in their own past, there wouldn't be much of a challenge:

1) Get the kids out of country first, hide them in a house under Fidelius Charm, with Harry himself as the Secret Keeper

2) Assemble team 1 with Sirius, Remus, Tonks, Andromeda, and Teddy. Come clean with them, as they should be Harry's primary confidants. He may want to assign Andromeda as his children's babysitter/caretaker, and his children should be familiar with her.

3) Assemble team 2 with his younger self, Hermione, Ron, and Ginny. Come clean with them, as young Harry takes it very badly of not being informed properly. Get Harry out of country too (maybe with other kids together), so he would be less affected the link with Voldemort and could train Occlumency without too much pressure.

4) Invest Potter and Black (maybe Granger) assets in Muggle stock market, CSCO all the way to March 2000!

5) Now confront Dumbledore and plan; because the huge cost, they couldn't afford to play nice anymore, especially not with those Ministry minions. Getting rid of Umbridge and Lucius Malfoy should take high priority as these two were the primary sources of corruption at the Ministry.

6) Horcruxes: Diadem first, Locket next as it's sitting right in Sirius' house, go after the Ring with backups, and demand to seize Lestrange vault to compensate Longbottoms.

7) In case Voldemort shows up to defend his Cup, that would be the grand opportunity to expose him to the world and to pit the Goblin nation against him. I doubt Goblins would be too happy with a Horcrux hiding in their vaults, and they should be even less pleased if he attacked their bank directly.

8) If he does not, it's time to set traps at Gaunt Shack and the Cave because Voldemort is bound to check for his Horcruxes. That would be the optimal time to capture and neutralize him. At worst, reduce him back to his wraith like condition. If Voldemort is captured, run the most extreme interrogations on him, obliviate him back to his infancy, dose him with Draught of Living Death, and lock him behind wards significantly stronger than Nurmengard. Voldemort's capture should also yield locations for Wormtail and Nagini, two very important pieces to his final defeat.

9) With Voldemort neutralized, they now have the time to work on removing Harry's scar. I refuse to believe that killing Harry is the only option, as he has never been a properly made Horcrux to begin with.

10) With a new alliance formed by Blacks, Boneses, Longbottoms, Potters, Weasleys, and Dumbledore, it's now time to go after remaining Death Eater scums still free. Avery, the Carrows, Crabbe, Goyle, Lucius Malfoy, Macnair, Parkinson, Selwyn, Travers, and Yaxley must all be economically and politically destroyed, and if they had committed enough crimes, also physically.

** A lot of people ending up stunned in Aragog's nest, that's for sure.
