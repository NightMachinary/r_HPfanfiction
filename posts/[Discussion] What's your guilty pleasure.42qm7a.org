Be it a common trope or clich√©, or even an odd pairing? What's your favorite story that you tend to hide? I'll even link mine if anyone asks. And please, no judgement on people's answers. I want a happy thread, not one full of flames!


** Time/dimension travel. Especially when Harry gets to meet his parents.

Hell of a guilty pleasure. It's pretty common in HP fandom, but I swear I've read like all of them. Like every few months I go searching for new fics but every time I do I've already seen/read them.

***** Champion of a Distant Dream, Miracle of Zero: Kingdom of the Forsaken, Mechanized Magus, A Demon Lord's Hero (My personal favorite) A throne Nobody Wants, A Soul of Fire, The YOungest Campione, God Slaying Blade Works, A second Chance, A Fake Familiar, Kaleid Liner Lias' Pawn, Steel Savior, King of Souls, Knights and Swords, Shattered Blade, Severant of Zero, and The Hill of Swords are the ones I have favorited on FFN. I haven't read some of them in a long-ass time, but I liked them all.

**** I don't know where to start with recommendations, haha. I've read a lot throughout the years, but honestly most of them are pretty similar that they've all melded into one in my mind, and I have trouble remembering and differentiating them.

I don't think I've ever read one where Harry brings back his parents with him. I think most of the ones I read (if they even are complete... which you know, it isn't 99% of the time), the lesson/story seems to be for Harry to "get to know his parents and know their love for him" before going back to his own dimension where now he has the strength to defeat Voldemort. Or to save that world from their Voldemort.

Off the top of my head, the only one I've read where a character from the other dimension goes back with Harry is linkffn(3571753). Not his parents though, [[/spoiler][his sister.]] I like this one.

linkffn(7534131) was updated recently. The story is pretty sound. The writer hasn't gotten into much Harry and James/Lily interactions yet.

linkffn(2987160) is my guilty pleasure of guilty pleasures. The story goes absolutely nowhere. There's this plot point that's suddenly introduced during the last few chapters, but it felt tacked on and jarring, like the author suddenly realised the story's lack of direction. And yet... I dunno, I remember that it made me laugh a couple of times, and characters were fun to read about.

You've probably seen linkffn(8730465) and linkffn(6892925) recommended here.

linkffn(4198643) Time travel fic, where Harry meets his parents as teenagers during their school years. The fic has a fair few grammatical/spelling errors and the writing is pretty simple. But I think it kinda has it own charm. Probably only read this if you want something super lightweight. It's pretty slice of life, kind of, IMO.

linkffn(1513042) Another time travel fic. It's pretty much the definitive "Harry goes back to his parents' time." story. I loved it when I read it, but it hasn't held up well.

Haven't read these in a couple of years: linkffn(2507697), linkffn(1962685). /A Stranger in an Unholy Land/ is one of the classics, but I dunno if it holds up well.

linkffn(5757945), linkffn(9649140) I don't remember these at all even though I know I've read them.

--------------

Oh fuck, they're all pretty terrible. And I have a terrible memory. I probably missed out on a lot too; I never used to be in the habit of keeping track of what I've read and titles of fics.

***** *Delenda Est*, linkffn(5511855), is probably the best 'Harry travels dimension/time to meet his parents' story imho. [[/spoiler][Teaching potion to Lily and Marauders, breaking up James/Snivellus fights, assigning detention to James/Sirius, Lily crushing on him... that was really fun to read]]

*** When I first discovered Harem fics I really liked them but soon got tired of the bad writing. Smut is all great and fine but I want some plot too. I feel a lot of writers attempt a Harem story planning to have lots of plot but then get caught up in the whole thing and turns mostly to smut. I found that Harry with two girls is usually more manageable but still has that Harem feel to it.

** I really love a smart!Harry, super!Harry (But, I generally only like this if Voldemort [or whoever the Big Bad is] is also super, it gets super boring otherwise), and Wrong Boy-Who-Lived. The thing is, there are lots of /poorly/ written fics in these categories, where it's hard to find a nice story because of either technical writing issues or general plot issues. This tends to contribute a lot to the stigma of these types of stories, I think.

In general, I don't really have strong likes/dislikes when it comes to pairings, if the author can make it work. I tend to avoid slash, but don't mind H/D.

*** If you haven't already, I would recommend Deprived. It's quite a stretch from other stories, but I loved every bit of it and was devastated when I saw when it had last updated. Obviously I wouldn't recommend HP and the Veela, but I think you should look at it to at least decide whether you like it or not. No judgement in this thread:)

I don't know why exactly, but I actually tend to stay away from the H/Hr pairings, despite JKR saying she thought they should've ended up together. Probably because most of the stories I read were a bit like Harry Crow, a story I absolutely detest, again no judgement if you like it. I really don't like the soul bonding trope as it often comes off as forced and a bit of a cop out on the authors part to actually develop a proper relationship with ups AND downs.

Seeing as you seem to have similar tastes, care to compare stories. I'm new to Fanfiction in the ways of having a profile, so not many faves/follows or reviews.

But I'd love to hear what your favorite is, and maybe get some recommendations :)

**** I saw your other post, and it's weird but we seem to have the same preferences lol. I got up to ch10 of Harry Crow before I nope outta that one. However, don't be discouraged from a pairing just because of one fic/author! There are plenty of H/Hr stories that I actually liked, but I think I forgot to fave them :(

Yeah, I didn't want to list all of the things I dislike, but I really am not a fan of plot devices that encourage lazy writing or weirdness. This includes soul bonds, marriage contracts (they are literally pre-pubescents, pls no), and magical oaths. Sometimes oaths work, sometimes they don't, but I feel that they are a crutch, tbh.

As for recommendations, check out this: [[http://pastebin.com/wwtmhSKY]], it's pretty general, but I enjoyed a lot of the stories on there. And I have a few stories faved on my profile, and most of the authors I've faved have good faves, etc, etc. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6029474/]]

Also, you should check out a few communities, the DLP 5 star community is really good as DLP is known to be pretty harsh in its criticisms. You should also visit their forum: [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/]] and check the library section, it's got good works there too. Also, check out the Sacrifices arc, it's a good take on slytherin!Harry (also one of my faves), super!Harry and a H/D: linkffn(2580283), warning, it's quite long though (~3mil words).

** I love Harry/Draco fanfic. I like reading pretty much anything with them as long as it's not terribly written. I've always liked creature fics, BDSM etc. I don't have a favourite story in particular that I like to hide. I would hide the fact that I read it at all because I've found that other people tend to be bemused by it. What about yourself?

*** I'm not one for slashes so much, but as I said, no judgement here. I *love* wrong boy who lived stories, or powerful!harry and smart!harry. My favorite guilty is linkffn(Deprived by The Crimson lord). So clich√©d, so OP, so *good.*

I've only found one WBWL that I disliked, Harry Potter and the Veela, because it's so poorly written. I hate the fact that it's updating and Deprived has been abandoned :(

**** That's a really good one. I remember reading that a a year or two ago. I don't only read slash but it's definitely my guilty pleasure.

Although, I take issue with the expression "guilty pleasure," I don't feel guilty at all about reading it. If you like something, you like it :)

***** I like your take on the idea of guilt. One of my favorite things which I am completely not guilty about is Blaise Zabini. Not pairings or anything, just his character. It's like the whole fanfic community took what little had been said (slytherin, neutral family, possibly killer mom) and decided upon an almost universal character. Sarcastic, smart, politically minded and neutral. Easily the best character out there, and 9 times out of 10, he's written this exact way.

I think that part of my hate for Harry Potter and the Veela stems from the fact that the author seemed to miss the memo. His Blaise was caucasian, blonde and had a crush on the infallible Harry Potter. Plus the older sister he created to play Draco's sometimes funny but mostly 2d girlfriend.

Anyway, I digress in my train of thought. Though I can't give you an engaging conversation of HP/DM slash, I do like the close friendship dynamic they have in some stories, particularly when Harry can influence Draco in a good way. Do you have any good stories that have that, preferably sans fluff?

*** What are your fave Harry/Draco stories, out of interest? The only one I've liked so far is the Sacrifices arc.

I find it a fairly interesting pairing TBH, due to the history of the parents, etc. That being said, I haven't looked specifically for it as I fear that a /lot/ of stories would have been written that contain heavy shades of Draco in Leather Pants, generally leading to crap writing.

**** Fix-fics are any fics that attempt to 'fix' canon in some way, be it filling plot holes or out-and-out saying, 'This is what should have happened.' My preferred variety is the type that tries to make the outcomes of canon events better for the characters. :)

***** I do read those, quite often in fact. And while I enjoy them, along with a bit of Dumbledore bashing, I feel like a lot of people are so removed from canon that Dumbles to them is completely evil and manipulative. I really don't like Weasley bashing, which often happens in fix-fics, just because it's so ridiculous that 11 year old Ron and 10 year old Ginny are working for him.

** I love powerful!Harry. I can actually put up with a lot of tropes as long as he's powerful and otherwise mostly in-character.

Sunset over Britain and Sunrise over Britain by Bobmin are probably the ones I go back to read when I want to indulge BUT I generally admit that pretty freely.

Since you asked about ones we try to hide, I'd just go ahead and own up to liking What a Witch Needs by Petalsoft. I think it covers all the tropes.

** linkffn(Bittersweet Dreams by Takeda Lee). It's bad. I know it's bad. I love it. I don't think I can classify any particular trope, genre, or cliche as a guilty pleasure, but that story is it.

Oh, and I'll read any Harry/Fleur story. I will close it if its absolute garbage, though.

  [FFO part 1] The line between Fantasy and Nightmare is sometimes blurred, but in this world it no longer exists. A Fallen Angel, a cursed Demon, a vengful Mage and a Slytherin girl, are the pillars holding up the last hope for a failing world.

** Honestly, my fanfiction tastes are almost exclusively guilty pleasures. Marriage contracts, girl!Harry, time turner stories, canon male/OC pairings, book reader finds herself in Hogwarts, the works.

The sheer number of Fred/OC, George/OC, Remus/OC, Sirius/OC, Oliver/OC, Cedric/OC and Draco/OC stories that I've read over the years is truly wild. In my defense, I do limit myself to well-written ones. Mostly.

** Harry/Slytherin girl. Sometimes this falls under marriage contracts, or political fics... sometimes it's just a typical Daphne story, or if it were 2005, fem!Blaise. The problem is, of course, that 99% of the stories suck. So, it's hard to call something a guilty pleasure if I take no actual pleasure from the badness, but rather, I feel like it's an unfulfilled desire to see one done properly.

*** I've read a lot of Harry/Daphne but is there actually any good Harry/fem!Blaise stories? I tried looking once and they all seemed pretty bad. The only good one I read was when Harry was her Grandfathers apprentice but the romance sucked because it was just a big love triangle with Hermione. I'll read H/Hr stories but I hate it when they throw her in as a conflicting love interest just to create angst.
