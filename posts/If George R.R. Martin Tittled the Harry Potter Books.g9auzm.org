***** The best parts, to me, where the finale scenes and the second alternate reality. Everything else felt like mediocre to bad fanfic- messy plot, character derailment, weird ship-teasing, the works. Even tiptoed on the edge of Dumbledore bashing as I recall.

But I'll give it this- I've observed that nearly everyone who's just read the script seems to dislike it, or outright hates it- and nearly everyone who's seen it performed live seems to love it. Plays are generally meant to be viewed, not read. So I don't think its entirely fair to judge it if you haven't seen it performed.

****** Only based on the plot, I'd say the best thing in the whole play was that it had Scorbus in it. At the same time the worst one was that it did not have Scorbus for real. I was really expecting them to have feelings for each other by the end.

******* Oh if only Albus/Scorpius was the worst bit of ship teasing that play does. While I feel its a pairing that's so common in fandom as to be cliche, there's nothing actually /wrong/ with it unless you're a homophobic twit. Time traveling Albus Potter/Hermione on the other hand? That is truly and genuinely creepy.

Maybe Ron doesn't survive the chess game? Or Harry himself dies, and the rest of the story is the others try to carry on without him. What made Ned's death so shocking, in part, is that he was set up like a major protagonist- and then he dies before the end of the first book.

**** People focus on Neville because he was the other choice for Chosen One. But Voldemort picked him, and while Neville develops a lot, he isn't protagonist material until late in the series, if then.

In all honesty, I think if Harry bought it in book one, Hermione becomes the protagonist.

Although GRRM likes his multiple protagonists.
