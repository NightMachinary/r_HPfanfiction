Albus in Slytherin: linkffn(Clash by Shezwriter)

Scorpius in Gryffindor: linkffn(Questions and Answers by little0bird)

linkffn(Backward with Purpose: The Book of Albus) has Albus in Slytherin, but takes place post Hogwarts. Read book I first, or nothing will make any sense.

  When Rose resurrects her brother, she pushes the world to the brink of another war. Meanwhile Albus, cold and brilliant, may just be the second coming of Tom Riddle. Forced to work together to unravel their parents' suspicious deaths, they must solve the past if they want to survive the future. And answer the question: Just why does history keep repeating itself?

  When the past and present collide with the Potter/Weasley children... A bit AU with characters' names and some pairings. Family tree now posted on my profile page. 3/16/10 -- going back and cleaning up a few things; nothing major will change.

  This is the companion novel to Backward With Purpose. I'd read that one first. This story is complete; the sequel has begun.

  UNDER EDITING! (I): After a trauma, the Malfoys are reluctant to send their son off to Hogwarts, especially after Scorpius gets off to an eventful start and nothing goes as planned. He finds things are wrong at Hogwarts under the rule of a dangerous headmaster who has it in for him while in the shadows lie an even greater threat than anyone could have foreseen. COMPLETE
