Looking for a story where the Dursley's either have a baby after Dudley, or is his twin. I would like to stick to canonical parings, and would like the second Dursley to be a girl, who's actually friends with Harry, and not like his family. She would be magical, and go to Hogwarts! If anyone knows anything like this, let me know! Also, I would like it to be completed. I just hate starting a story, and never be able to finish it.

This is one that springs to mind, and it is finished so :)

  We have all read the whole 'HarryMalfoyHermione has a sister, yada, yada, yada.' Idea, but what if the aforementioned sister was not a PotterMalfoyGranger? What if she was a Dursley? Meet Roisin Dursley. Witch of the family.

** linkao3(23305315)

Fair warning here - the first part of the fic is decent (if somewhat RonBash-y and UselessDumbledore-y), but it tips towards Dark!(Jerk!)Harry when he starts learning and using Unforgivables on Death Eaters.

Not complete, but the last update was very recent.

  Two years after Dudley was born, Petunia and Vernon had another child, a daughter. They believed Jackie Dursley was perfectly normal, thank you very much. She wasn't like their freak nephew, not at all. They were wrong. (Takes place starting in Harry's third year)
