I can obviously do the old standby of Site:reddit.com keywords but wondered if there was another way I don't know.


** Only somewhat related but it would be so cool to have stats similar to the ones the XKCD bot has that show how many times a fic has been linked and the % of how often it's been linked compared to others. As it is now, I don't think there's a good way to see if your fic has been discussed on reddit specifically.

** A sudden influx of hits on the traffic graphs might indicate your fic's been linked somewhere, though it gives no indication as to the source.

** If you go to the bot's user page, you can search their comments with enhancement suite for reddit. Should tell you whether it's been linked.

** There's actually a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3f97u2/the_most_popular_fanfics_of_all_time_in/][Most Frequently Recommended fics thread]] on the sidebar. So you can at least see how many times your fic story has been linked in the subreddit.

Hasn't been updated for a while though. May be request the guy to update it?

*** Wow! That is /incredibly/ out of date. I think I will suggest the guy to update it.
