Does anyone know any good depressed!HarryPotter fanfics? I've gone through all the ones that pop up when you search it on Google but I can't find any other ones


** One trick I have learned to find more fics on Google is to do

Harry Potter [put subject here] site:fanfiction.net "Chapter 1"

This forces results to only return searches from fanfiction.net thats at Chapter 1

  Because of a student death, new measures are being taken to screen students for abuse. With Dumbledore facing an enquiry, Snape is in charge of making sure every student receives an examination. Abused!Harry. Character death. Sevitis. In answer to the "New Measures for Screening Abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. Yes, it is a "Snape is Harry's biological father" story.

** I'm not entirely sure whether it truly qualifies as depressed, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8662532/1/Nothing-to-Lose][Nothing To Lose]] may just about qualify...

In the story, Harry logically (but mistakenly) concludes that Ron and Hermione have both been killed by Death Eaters as he can't get in touch with either. Cue self-sacrificing rampage of revenge while the Wizarding World frantically tries to work out just what the heck is going on...
