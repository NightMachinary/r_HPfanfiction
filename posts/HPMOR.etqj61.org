Okay this maybe more a rant, but I must honestly say I have never understood this story, interest in it and all the praise it gets. I see comments that insist it is better than canon, people passionately arguing its many supposed merits, how it fixes everything. How it uses science to explain and explore magic and what not.

When I tried reading it. I really did. Several times in fact. Each time I thought I'll try and get through the chapters. Yeah ... I find it insufferable. It is horribly absurd, over the top, cliche filled and unrealistic to the extreme. Nothing in it makes any actual sense. No matter how much of a genius Harry is. To me this reads as a worst kind wish fulfilment.

Am I wrong? Is there actually anything redeeming about this story? Please can someone explain to me what's the catch there?

... or is it just one big joke everyone is in on, except me?

You must have read that on some other place, because this subreddit's opinion on HPMOR is overwhelmingly negative. Even stories that have all the flaws of HPMOR, but several times more blatant, plus a few more on top, seem to be better tolerated.

** I would say HPMOR started out as something more like a crackfic with some serious conversations thrown in. At a certain point it then became a fix fic, but preserving its earlier canon, before progressing into conventional fanon (with wards and House Potter etc.) and then finally went Happy Feet/The Last Battle (and, in many ways, Deathly Hallows) and was mostly about the author's Views.

Which is to say... if someone can remember all the chapters with the Quidditch alternative, that'd be great.

And it does start with a warning that if you aren't feeling it by around chapter whatever (5? 10? 15?) you should give up on it... so whatever it eventually became, it's very much aware what it is. Hence, HPMOR is definitely an example of caveat emptor.

Note... HPMOR has... as I remember, fairly obnoxious takes on both House Potter and wards but it's hardly unusual in this regard. And you have to get, iirc, bloody far into it to discover these particular issues.

EDIT for clarity... I liked the crackfic stuff a lot. I really, really do not like The Last Battle. Take what you will from that.

** *TL;DR:* It can be an amusing read, especially the first half, but only if you can force yourself not to look at characters as people.

If you mostly share Yudkowsky's metaphysical assumptions and his hopes for the future of humanity in broad strokes, you can enjoy the /first half/ of the fic: it was amusing, downright hilarious in places, and didn't take itself too seriously at the start; it had about the right mix of references (pop-cultural and scientific) that I knew about and that I didn't know about and could learn something from.

The author did take on board a lot of fanon. There was all sorts of wizardly nobility stuff, character personalities taken straight out of mediocre power fantasy fic, and magic that functioned like a battery (though Harry didn't get the biggest one, so I guess that was OK). I didn't mind much the deviations from canon, as long as the author kept the digs at canon to a minimum. It also had its share of inanity, such as characters bursting into song at the Sorting, but it could be chalked up to the author's unfamiliarity with the fandom culture, and it was fairly isolated.

Over time, though, the fun stuff was largely supplanted in favour of Serious Business Slytherin Scheming with basically two people having any agency. I recall largely skimming through the second half of the story, because I did want to see how it ends. (My verdict: Meh.)

There is, also, a price for enjoying the first half of this fic: in order to enjoy the amusing interactions, you should try to stop thinking of the characters as representations of hypothetical human beings---canon or not---with distinct personalities, motivations, feelings, and thought processes. Rather, you need to think of them as acrobats or dancers in a tightly choreographed dance, or perhaps archetypes personified, like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commedia_dell'arte][Commedia dell'arte]] characters, acting out a morality play.

The saddest cut of all, though, is that if one wanted to write a Rational!Protagonist fic in HPverse, the most logical Rational!Protagonist is Hermione, not Harry. To make Harry one, Yudkowsky had to literally have someone completely overwrite his personality (which, admittedly, is more honest than most Smart!Studious!Harry writers, who don't provide even that much justification). To make Hermione one would have taken a few tweaks to her circumstances and interests. (Now, I understand why Yudkowsky chose Harry: his goals were didactic first and foremost, and not nearly as many people would have read a Hermione-centric non-romance fic as would read a Harry-centric one.)

So, I'll end with a number of plugs and recommendations for both fans and non-fans:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9950232/1/][/Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation/ by Robin Drew]] is, in a sense, what HPMOR should have been. Unfortunately, unlike HPMOR, it updates very, very slowly.
- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-wizard-of-woah-and-irrational-methods-of-irrationality.337233/][The Wizard of Woah and Irrational Methods of Irrationality]] is a pretty hilarious MST-style deconstruction of the fic.

When HPMOR was first published, its opening chapters seemed like it would be, well, a story. Nothing special, but entertaining.

It turns out it was intended to be some kind of scientific parable instead.

Unfortunately, the end result was something that fails both as a story and as a parable.

But yes, it's a very niche audience to say the least, sure. Only... why should that mean it's bad?

*** I wouldn't say he's a master author, but many of his stories are quite enjoyable, and I do consider Harry Crow to be better than the last two books of canon, but for specific reasons:

1) Character development - more people get more development in Harry Crow than over the entire course of canon. Then again, having characters grow and change is clearly not JKR's strong suit.

2) No Idiot Ball - every decision the characters make is fully consistent with their portrayal to that point and given the circumstances. Nobody veers wildly OOC because they need to in order to make plot happen. Again, this comes out ahead of canon more because of a deficiency in Rowling's writing, as she treated her characters more as ambulatory plot devices than as actual characters.

3) Victory feels earned - Harry and co. don't win because of some arbitrary rule of wand ownership and blind luck. They train, and prepare, and build alliances, and end up winning victories that truly feel earned rather than contrived.

**** His stories are guilty pleasures, really, as many have alluded to in the past whenever his name's brought up. And I agree with that. You know who's going to win when reading his stories, but therein lies a huge problem: it breaks any spehere of suspence he /could/ create within his stories. Sure, some people don't like suspense and want to know exactly what they're getting when reading his stories, but other people do like suspense, and I think he would be better received here if his stories weren't always so easy for Harry to win.

I haven't read Harry Crow so I can't comment on that, but of his stories I've read, there's been zero character development that I have seen. Not only that, every character of his is one-dimensional and extremely boring to read. Maybe I've been reading too much Stephen King lately, but King kills it with his characters. I'm not comparing Robst to King as King is a professional author and has been writing for decades, but Robst either can't write good character development or simply chooses not to in his stories. Again, Harry Crow may be different.

I agree with you in that Robst does away with the idiot ball (something that really bogged down JK Rowling), but I'd argue that his characters actually are OOC (though not in accordance with the plots of his stories). I didn't read about Harry and Hermione when I combed through his stories some time ago, but instead read about completely new, one-dimensional, boring characters that have been slapped with the names of "Harry" and "Hermione". Ditto that to every other character he writes.

With your third point, although victory might feel earned, in his stories I have read, victory is simply just too easy (referring back to the lack of suspense that doesn't exist in his stories). It's typically a one-off and the good guys (always) win, no matter what. It destroys the mold of his stories and makes them way too predictable (though again, some readers may like that).

** HPMoR was the first fanfiction I read, the one which changed my perception of fanfiction from 'a bunch of weirdos that resulted in 50 shades of grey' to 'wow this is awesome! I should write fanfiction too'. I've recommended it to two people; one loved it as much as I do, the other couldn't stand it. It's definitely not for everyone.

I don't care about canon characterization. I don't even care about realistic characterization, as long as it's internally consistent. HPMoR is an unevenly-paced awesome story, with long sections dedicated to sharing and promoting the titular 'methods of rationality' thrown in with more or less success.

I've read it repeatedly - finished a reread just last week, in fact - and continue to enjoy it fully every time. But then, I'm a rational-leaning person who enjoys most things to come out of the rational fanfiction community and thus probably closely adjacent to the target audience.

It was funny, clever, gripping, intriguing, heart-wrenching, imperfect, and beautiful. I've yet to find more than a handful of other fics I would put on the same level, and it remains in my top-10 to this day. There are some stories you love and then come back to later and discover aren't as good as you thought, but HPMoR somehow manages to surprise me with how good it is every time.

So, I think it's the same as with Seventh Horcux - another awesome story which some people just don't get. Tastes are different. One man's trash is another man's treasure. No one thing will every fit all. I personally don't get why a lot of popular things are popular, so I'm glad to have found some that work well for me. Like HPMoR.

​

And, anyway, isn't about 99% of fanfiction about wish-fulfillment in one way or another anyway? At least this version of Harry is imperfect, makes mistakes, learns lessons, screws things up, and doesn't just have everything miraculously go right with no effort.

******* Yea and thats how Harry interprets it. Whenever i see this comment as an argument to claim its a bad fanfic, its because "omg a child wouldve never said something like that" ( or something along those lines). What people don't say is that Harry is immediately horrified and then rationalizes on how Draco's upbringing and the socioeconomic environment where he lives in(which allows Malfoys to to anything they want) are the reasons Draco could say that and it ultimately needs to be stopped. He does /not/ ever condone it but he understands where its coming from.

And that kind of thinking its not that uncommon (regretfully) in modern society. Have you seen "13 reasons why"? The antagonist said something like what Draco said multiple times and then acted on it because he was an entitled son of a bitch whose parents didnt teach him right from wrong.

Harry then remembers that this is the son of a ruthless killing machine who has control over almost all politics in Magic UK, so he can't really change his whole way of thinking in their second meeting. But you know what? In his own twisted way he succeeds in changing Draco.

*** Although it's true that HPMoR is particularly egregious in that regard due to not featuring just fictional children but fictional /child prodigies/, I don't think singling HPMoR out of all /HP/ media and fanfics for this holds much water. Children in fanfic never act like real children, thank God. Even the children in /canon/ are way more focused and coherent than real children usually are, the overexcited scatterbrains.

Tl;dr, children in fanfic acting and speaking more like teenagers or adults, to me, is just part of the genre conventions. Compare people talking in rhyme in classical theater, or singing in opera/musicals. No, it's not realistic. No, no one's asking you to believe that it /is/, you're just supposed to suspend your disbelief for a minute and enjoy the witty dialogue/nice rhymes/musical number that you get out of it.

'course, if the supposedly witty dialogue and the supposedly intricate plot in /HPMoR/ doesn't do anything for you, then sure, it won't feel /worth it/. But that's an issue with the humor and the plot, not an issue with the way the children are written /per se/.

***** Aye, gotta concur with [[/u/Asviloka]] . The writing and plot strucutre in HPMoR can be accused of many things, but the author clumsily changing course halfway through /really/ isn't an accusation that holds any water. You can argue that his idea (to subvert the "politicking children" trope by revealing his child protagonist isn't actually a child at the very end) makes for an unsatisfying reading experience. But it was a very /deliberate/ writing decision, whatever you think of it. And again, saying "it was deliberate" isn't necessarily an excuse. If you think it's annoying, then it's annoying and HPMoR's not for you, and that's that, the fact that the things that annoy you are deliberate really shouldn't change that opinion.

** To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand HPMOR. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical reader's head. There's also Harry's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike HPMOR truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Harry's existential catchphrase "World domination is such an ugly phrase. I prefer to call it world optimization," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Eliezer Yudkowsky's genius wit unfolds itself on their Computer Monitors. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

**** It would be Rick and Morty if the character were swapped and it would have made no sense, the grandpa would have been the shy and 'dumb' one while the teen would have been the drunk adventurous genius.

It would make no sense and not been as funny. It is a thing to make the reader believe in what they read and if the author don't fail the premise and make it a believable thing into his own universe then it work.

It just doesn't for MoR, it's super cringe and not believable for me, i just can't stand it.

** It really isn't better than original books.

I liked the story, followed it to the end. I still would not recommend it to everyone.

I see it as a good try at establishing the ideas like rationality, scientific thought, problem solving, Bias recognition and many more such ideas. There is good in it, if you are interested in all that.

Narratively, it's Somewhat shaky. Doesn't feel like the author was particularly fond of the original books. But, that is fair it was a children's book. :)

*** Although I wouldn't swear to the fact that the author (or a lot of his most diehard fans) would agree with the following, I feel like the "it's better than canon" argument largely rests on the underlying assumption that no matter how /well/ it does, it what it's /trying/ to do is more praiseworthy than what canon was trying to do. Which, I mean, gets at philosophical and religious opinions, so obviously it's /very/ subjective, but "canon is increasingly about a Christian worldview, albeit not to Narnia-levels, whereas /HPMoR/ is a decent introduction to the concept of rationality and preference-utilitarianism" is objectively the case.

Course, you can think that canon being better at what they're doing than HPMoR is at what /it's/ doing outweighs the fact that HPMoR is doing something more "ethical". Or you can disagree with the author of HPMoR's philosophical views (hey, maybe /you/'re a Christian!), in which case the whole appeal will be lost on you, of course. But that's the core of the argument, I feel. It's a bit uncouth to say it, but the real reason most HPMoR readers are ticked-off at people defending canon is "but J.K. Rowling /believes in heaven/!!..."

I think what I get from this thread - the problem is tone at the beginning of the story - it reads very much like a over the top crack fic. It is kind of hard to take it seriously, relate to it. Few people have said to me that it only picks up much later.

I'll try one day as a challenge to myself to give it a proper read.

Imagine that, only the references are all pretentious classical literature and science jokes. It's a fic written to appeal to the kind of people you'd probably work very hard to avoid at parties.

Lord-Potter-Black in this thread is making a reference to a joke about a show called Rick and Morty that people have rather similar feelings about, but there are people who feel that way about HPMoR.

***** You're making stuff up completely from scratch about the author's motivation.

The author portrays this Harry as a genius at some things and an idiot at others, which makes him a fun character to read about. This Harry's memorized the D&D rulebooks but never played it because he doesn't have any friends. That's not a Mary Sue trait. The author decided to write a character with no social skills, for fun. This Harry's lack of social skills leads him to make some serious and hilarious mistakes.

If the author somehow gets a kick out of being hated, he failed miserably, since he's written one of the most popular fanfics ever. Console yourself with that thought if it helps.

****** Mary Sues are self-inserts. if i had a diaper fetish and wrote a story in which i made Harry into an idealized version of my personality, his corresponding diaper fetish would be a Mary Sue trait by virtue of being part of my ideal personality that i inserted into the character. Mary Sue traits are whatever i as an author aspire towards and consider uber cool. ya feel?

if you do have social skills, it's really not hard to pinpoint the moments in the text where you can almost see Eliezer bending over to savor the smell of his highly rational, exceedingly intelligent, tragically unsociable farts. the emotion i experienced most often while forcing myself through that ordeal was second-hand embarrassment, and let me tell you, it's absolutely no surprise that it's so popular. it's the wet dream of every wannabe Eliezer in the world.

I have read and suffered throught a lot of worse fics, but I really, really disliked the way it all was presented - the author has the habit of making you feel dumb for not getting his references and then gives out praising for getting the others, basically, I couldn't stand the author and his writing style - he thinks himself to be so /clever/, that the /mortal people who don't read his blog/web-page/ are /beings of reduced intellect./
