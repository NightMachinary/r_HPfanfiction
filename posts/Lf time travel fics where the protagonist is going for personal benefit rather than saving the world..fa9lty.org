No bashing, preferably not Harry-centric. Any recommendations?

  Someone has a daring plan to go back in time and fix everything. No wait, not him, I meant the other... how many people have time traveled anyway? Poor Harry seems to be the only normal one left.

  Lavender takes one step forward and -- just like the snap of a finger, the blink of an eye, the drop of a pebble -- Hogwarts is left behind. There's no jump, no flashes of light, no whirlwinds of disconnected images. Just one little step; behind stood her war and in front stands 1947. "Huh," she says to herself, "didn't see this in the tea leaves."

** I don't think there're a lot of them. However, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10672917/chapters/23626929][The Debt of Time]] is quite good. It starts with Hermione pulling Sirius back from the veil and the basically the Deathly Hallows book but then she gets sent back in time to the Marauders time by Lupin to, in his words, have a real childhood. I don't know if it counts as a personal benefit. It's also Hermione/Remus and Hermione/Sirius. And I have to warn you that it's um... smutty.
