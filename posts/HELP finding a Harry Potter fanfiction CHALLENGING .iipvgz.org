Hi, long time lurker first time poster. Ive been trying to find this fanfiction for the last few days and it's just driving me bonkers. I'm officially admitting I need help (cri). It's been years since I've read this fanfiction so I don't even remember the premise just scenes:

PAIRING (honestly kinda rusty on this): - Hermione granger or (fem!harry) x Multiple (Cedric is one of the first ones) - I believe the end pairing was meant to be Tom Riddle

SCENES I Remember

Hermione x Cedric

- Takes place during Goblet of Fire
- Hermione is with the Weasley family when they go to Quidditch World Cup, she bumps into Cedric and they kiss or more. Hermione is the aggressor.
- In this story she is flirty and sexually confident though I think a virgin. Their dalliance continues at Hogwarts until Rita Skeeter publishes the article basically calling her a whore? Not sure why but for some reason Cedric during one of their hookups in the room of requirements implies or says something that pisses Hermione off. She declares he's never getting in her pants and means it. There is SMUT!

Hermione x Viktor Krum

- the whole school is talking/gossiping about Hermione. Viktor, someone I think she's kinda been ignoring, stands up for her or something.
- after blowing up at Cedric she reappears with a gift for Viktor, it's an enchanted quidditch game. There's a smaller table top quidditch field with miniature quidditch players that people can control.
- Professor flitwick rushes down from the teachers table to compliment the spell work.
- Viktor is in aw and asks why, Hermione just shrugs and thanks him for his kindness (don't really remember their being any romantic undertones between them)
- Cedric gets jealous and confronts Hermione alone in the hallway and she literally is like whatever dude and moves on

Hermione x Tom Riddles diary (?)

- I believe I recall that she was slipped Tom Riddles journal as well (This part I'm really not sure if I'm remembering correctly). While Hermione is darker, more bold and casually exploring her sexuality with people you get the sense that she's just been influenced, not possessed. She's still her. I think the diary even tutors her on magic. (How she was able to create Viktors gift.

Remember Cedric/Hermione is NOT main pairing, she gets paired with multiple, he's just one of the only hookups I remember.

FYI: I read the majority of my fanfictions on fanfiction.net and archiveofourown.com. I'm usually really good at finding fanfictions but because I remember only snippets, I really can't find it. ANY LEADS ARE GREATLY APPRECIATED! (And recommendations for sexually free Hermione or fem!harry potter fanfictions.

TL;DR Finding smut with plot fanfic of Hermione (probably or fem!Harry) being smart and sexually curious with multi members, (not one-shots) first of which being Cedric who eventually fucks it up leaving an opening for next guy. Takes place in Goblet of Fire. May be Tom riddle end goal and Hermione may be influenced/taught by Tom Riddle diary.

If you've made it this far you're seriously awesome. Even if you have no idea what fanfiction my scattered brain is trying to find you spent time reading my message, I appreciate that very much :)
