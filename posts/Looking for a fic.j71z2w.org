:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember a fic, where Harry went and joined another war. It wasn't long after he beat Voldemort. I think he went to The U.S. maybe? Gabrielle and he meet cause she's a nurse and they eventually get together, it also has him tell Ron and Hermione that he has to go by himself it that helps. Thanks in advance
