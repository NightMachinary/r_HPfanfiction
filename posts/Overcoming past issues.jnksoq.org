Rather it be Harry slowly accepting what the Dursley's did to him wasn't cool.

Or Snape realizing that his treatment of Harry isn't good, or letting go of Lily

Or Sirius growing up

ect. Can be a number of things to any of the characters.

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can be any length, can be old or new.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine

Am fine with het/slash/femslash/threesomes etc.

Would rather NOT have Weasley bashing where the Weasley's are using Harry for his fame and fortune, and no Ron abusing Hermione.

NO Rape of the characters please.
