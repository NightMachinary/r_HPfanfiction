** Perhaps bc she's the main female character in the series?

*** Does that really explain it though? I don't see how her being the main female character invites her to be paired with characters like Draco's obscure grandfather or the most random of names mentioned in passing in the books.

**** Harry is the main dude in the series and he's paired with everyone.

Stands to reason that Hermione would get the same treatment for people who want to write about a female pairing.

**** It explains it.

Most fans love her. Many fans are pretty weird.

** Like another user said, first reason that comes to mind is because she's the main female character

Second is that a lot of female readers identify with Hermione and it could be wish fulfilment

*** But if you're going off the wish fulfillment angle, what would draw the author to a name with no character behind it? The more I think about it the more I start to believe that the literary challenge of it all might play a role in these cases. Perhaps the author'll see a writing brief in learning of a character's name and reading the barest of backgrounds about them and relish the idea of writing themselves out of a self-imposed corner. Perhaps romance involving Hermione is simply their preferred medium for engaging such challenges?

It's like you said about Daphne Greengrass, there's a bare minimum of information so it's a character someone can start with a (close to) clean slate and write whatever story they want, when I think of wish fulfillment in that sense it's sort of like idealizing who you think a character is when it's some standard you've built in your mind and want to see written out

Not necessarily saying that's always the case or reasonable, but I'm sure it happens

I agree about the challenge it presents, as an example, I'm working on a fest fic that will have multiple rare pairs in it because I'm wanting to write for different characters than I normally do, one of the pairs might be Draco/Charlie, no idea why or how but I figured why not it'll be interesting to see how it plays out

** People want to pair the hero with everyone. Look at how much Harry gets paired with everyone. Girls. Boys, Pets, things, concepts. And he is just the sidekick.

** It's "Let's pair my favourite Female with X Character I want to write a story about" even if it doesn't make sense to an outsider looking in. Also with the Emma Watson effect. If Hermione had been played by someone unattractive, there'd be about 90% less Hermione pairing fics,
