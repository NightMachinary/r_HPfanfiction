:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I vaguely remember this fic (it might have been a series) on ao3 in which harry is adopted/taken away pre-hogwarts. he lives with either mcgonagall or maybe sirius/remus (i can't remember). I very vividly recall harry having a joint birthday party with neville and then remus or snape (idk) attacks the cake and all the children were crying.

I know it's not much to go on but I remember it being a funny and sweet story and I want to reread it so any help is appreciated :)
