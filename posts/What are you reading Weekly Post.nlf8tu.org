** Not sure if One-shots are okay. But I just found this Gem..

Rated T. For implications and mentions of multiple types of awful things. But not much happens on screen.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13889396/1/What-If-Lord-Voldemort-Had-Won]])

Its a decent show of muggles vs wizards. Not MUGGLE WANK. But yeah it is from POV of a muggle in a world where voldemort took over all the wizards and then just attacked muggles from the shadows. Really can't suggest you read this enough.

** Yesterday I started reading "Ghost of Privet Drive" by Andrew Wolfe, linkffn(13636100) for the first time. 7 chapters in, I'm enjoying it. It's a creative SI approach and has one of the most hilariously bizarre sentences I've ever read: "That'd be diagnostic: if Nazi Germany's history is the same but the meth consumption figures are lower than I remember, then wizards." Also reminds me of one of my favorite Dresden Files novels, Ghost Story.

I've also, ugh, started rereading "The Price of Everything" by sabhnc to try and see if I can make sense of it on a second read and if it's as much a hot mess as I remember (yes, it is). It's on AO3 but I'm not linking because if memory serves it's borderline at best on Rule 8, and also not super good.

Somehow in the course of 49 chapters it goes from "Hermione (no last name known) is an orphan surviving on the streets of London through prostitution and coping with it through drugs and alcohol when Professor McGonnagall makes her standard Muggleborn Induction Visit" to "The magically-conceived daughter of Bellatrix Lestrange and Lord Voldemort, who used to go by Hermione, has been crowned Queen of Scotland and arrested by the British (Muggle) authorities and is backing the IRA who she convinced to break the Good Friday Agreement, as well as other militant separatist movements in an effort to break up the United Kingdom and she arranged a second Death Eater breakout from Azkaban as cover for rescuing former Hogwarts students who'd been imprisoned for speaking Celtic languages and to placate her dad."

With stops along the way at Several Unpopular Gringotts Tropes, Slytherin Hermione, Veela Mates, Laird McGonnagall, Ludicrously Unique Wand Cores (Bellatrix's new wand has as its core one of Hermione's wing feathers, and no Hermione is not a Veela in this story), Prophetic Unicorns, Rewriting Voldemort's Resurrection Ritual, and of course the beginnings of a UK civil war featuring British authorities shooting protestors in Scotland and a wizard commando raid to disable the nuclear weapons at HMNB Clyde.

It's just so wierd.

Is this a popular setup? I've definitely read a fic that started this way before, but I didn't think I'd ever come across it again. In any case, your rundown makes it not at all interesting for me to follow up on it :D

Ghost of Privet Drive is great, I recommend it all the time, as is AndrewWolfe's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13694344/1/No-Fate][other fic]] which I hope they will return to, it's been lacking updates for a while /and we haven't even reached the timetravel bit yet/!

  Hermione Granger knows she's not a good person. Disillusioned with life at only twelve years old; she is cynical, manipulative, ruthless and, above all else, a survivor. For six years she has lived on the streets of London with only her sharp mind and her sharper knives to keep her alive, but a letter from an owl changes everything for Hermione, and the bond she forms on the Hogwarts Express with a timid boy with broken glasses, skinny wrists and a lightning-shaped scar will change the whole of Wizarding Britain.  Main Pairing: Harry Potter/Hermione Granger/Tom Riddle

** im reading this fic "Andromeda Liberata". it's about andromeda and ted tonks falling in love, but it's also about oppressive systems and political awakenings and toxic relationships and family dynamics

​

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/30448452/]]

​

it's outrageously good. it makes pureblood society feel so bizarre, mentally ill, and fucking *oppressive* to be a part of, all while also telling this wonderful story of personal growth and falling in love. it's one of the best things i've ever read in fandom lol./ i hope some of u read it, it's CRIMINALLY underrated bc it isn't a popular ship (it's also a femslash reimagining), but as far as interesting stuff within the universe goes it's SO good.

please comment for the author if u enjoy it, i really want her to feel as appreciated as she deserves to :)

** I'm reposting this comment, because the author has just updated the fic and I still have my expectations really high for it. For me is very original.

*Title:* Mendacium

*Author:* SomeoneFromBrazil

*Rating:* M

*Link:* [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13883437/1/Mendacium]]

*Summary:* It's a non-BWL Harry, who grew up with a different identity in an orphanage. He enters the Wizarding World when he receives his Hogwarts letter and the author is trying to make a parallel between young Tom Riddle and Harry. The twist, is that Harry has a brother who is the BWL (for real, no WBWL), his parents are alive and we still don't know why he was in an orphanage (the author claims not be due to "We need to focus on the BWL" type of explanation).

*What I Like About It:* So far, there are no annoying tropes. It's well-written (considering the author is a foreigner), and there is no bashing, child politics, or Lord Peverell-Black-Potter kind of thing. Honestly, in chapter two, the Weasleys make a small appearance and I was so relieved to read them as ordinary people and not the stupid ones we usually see in fanfiction.

Another positive point is that Harry isn't a right away genius (the next Merlin) on magic because he read three books in a week. I personally got interested in this fic because it's a No-BWL Harry, intead of the classical WBWL trope. Also, the usage of canon not-so-famous secondary characters to help the plot, such as Bathilda Bagshot, has got my interest.

*What I don't Like About It:* I don't like much the name the author chose for Harry's new identity (although I reckon he chose it to avoid the Hadrian kind of thing). It's not finished, but the author seems to have it mostly done (or, at least, planned).

I recommend this fanfiction because I think there are more positive points than negative ones. I would give it an 8 out of 10.

I got two more if you are into that generation! If you like Walburga or that era in general maybe you'll like them.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3736303][Dark and Fearsome]]

Walburga obsessing about Minerva in a way that kind of is similar to canon Sirius about Snape or canon Bellatrix about Voldemort. Disturbing and intense. Beautiful first-person pov. Short read around 3K. *Walburga/Minerva.*

[[https://eldritcher-hp-fics.dreamwidth.org/14994.html][Azrael]]

A calculating and charismatic Voldemort deliberately destroys Walburga's family because he wants her to go mad. It's pretty intense. Short read around 3K. *Gen darkfic*

***** I have read these before! Pretty sure it was your post somewhere else that I saw, ha.

The Minerva/Walburga one interesting. There wasn't a lot of work done on the relationship part of it, it was mostly trying to get inside Walburga's head, which I can respect as a thought exercise, but it didn't grab me.

Eldritcher's Minerva is great! I love all of their stories about her. Walburga's POV was a great choice for this piece. Intense is the right word!

Ha, what I am into is anything about Snape. I love Snape rare pairs (defined as anything but Snarry and Snamione). I think we have discussed this before in the context of Snape/Voldemort :) It's so hard to do and preserve what I love about Snape's character, though, you know, so when I find one that does, I'm so excited.

****** With you 100% on the Minerva/Walburga fic! I sometimes nerd out on writing choices and forget about the immersion and story part!

Eldritcher's Minerva is a proud and flawed character. Flesh and blood! I really love her characterization. The Riddle/Minerva dynamic, the Severus/Minerva dynamic and the Albus/Minerva dynamic is just unique in their Minerva fics.

Yeah! I remember you mentioned that maybe on the Sniddle thread! For Snape fics especially rare pairs [[https://snapecase.livejournal.com/][Snapecase]] can be good. YMMV because a lot of those are Snarry authors writing non-Snarry fics. Their Snape characterization in non-Snarry fics can be pretty similar to their Snape in Snarry fics.

I don't have any strong recs for Snape fics :( I love that theme also! Definitely lmk if you stumble on something interesting!

******* I don't have anything against Snarry as a philosophical matter, but I will say the Snarry fics I have liked are ones where Harry undergoes some experience so major (like, you know, traveling a thousand years in the past and spending the centuries as a portrait in the Slytherin common room) that he is unrecognizable as Harry and basically an OC. Harry as a main character in fic does nothing for me.

That was an elaborate way of saying I will definitely check out rare pairs written by Snarry authors, lol.

** I would mention two stories, one which was really excellent, other one ... not so much.

1. “Wind Shear” by Chilord linkffn(12511998) is really a great story. I am not a big fan of super!Harry and fight-centred stories, but this one is really well written. Harry, experienced Auror and an international Dark Wizards hunter falls back to 1970 in the beginning of the Blood War and he has to work from that situation. I usually complain how thin and too long most stories are. The author claims in the introductory author note that “this fic has been more thoroughly rewritten than any of my past fics. I hope it shows.” It truly does, it is very tight (/just/ 126,280 words) and even otherwise it is obviously very well polished. Also, although there is a motive of the potential relationship between Harry and Bellatrix Black (very common for Harry-in-1970s stories), it is a way more complicated and interesting than usually fast one. Highly recommended.

2. I was really looking forward to reading “When Hermione said ‘NO!'” by LordCroussette linkao3(27474469). I like very much “The Accidental Animagus” by [[/u/TheWhiteSquirrel]] linkao3(14078862) and the idea to the twist where Hermione rejects the idea of adopting Harry into the Grangers' family looked intriguing. When I was saying in the previous review that the story is very nicely tightly written, this is just an opposite. The story weights nice 30,664 words, and what interesting story we get about this basic conflict of Hermione rejecting adoption of Harry? Re-narrated mostly unchanged abbreviated story of the first four years of Harry, and that's basically it. Have you expected some psychologically complicated explanation of Hermione's [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/one-more-on-breakfast-in-new-york.html][seeming failure]] in this long narration? Nope, this is a Harmony story, so there is no character development allowed, the explanation is brutally boring: the unfeeling manipulative Dumbledore send Confundus charm on her. That's it, there is really not much to the story. I don't think you should bother.

** I'm currently re-reading, and awaiting updates on, Snipers Solve 99% of all Problems by silentwalrus. It's a hilarious crossover between Fullmetal Alchemist and Harry Potter. I highly recommend it to anyone needing a laugh. The author has other wonderfully well-written stories on AO3 as well.

** I'm reading this fic that updated today, [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13866437/1/An-Only-Child][An Only Child by Darkpurplelighter]]. It's a Percy-centric fic that starts in OotP when Fudge goes to arrest Dumbledore and Percy finds the Mirror of Erised, where it shows him as an only child and sets out to make it true. I like it because I think it's something different and unique in comparison to other Percy-centric fics I've read. As per the author's words, it's not a redemption story or Percy sees the light and somehow changes things, it's about a brother wanting to erase his own siblings from existence for his parents' sole love and affection. It is a dark theme, and that's the point and I love it.

The pacing is a bit accelerated at the beginning in the attempt to get the set up out of the way, but other than that it moves along steadily. The characters are well written, with Percy being a pretty good blend of his canon self and the cold-hearted sociopath he's turning into. Updates are slow, though, and it's only a few chapters long.

  Percy Weasley was shocked when he looked into the Mirror of Erised. It showed him, alone with his mother and father. No brothers. No sister. Him, alone as an only child. That was what Percy wanted, and there was only one way to make his deepest desire come true.

** I just finished Blackpool by The Divine Comedian, which I saw rec'd on another thread. 10/10 would recommend - it was well written and the story was was captivating. I loved both Regulus' and Sirius' characters, and their relationship. It's pretty dark, and reads like a combination horror mystery, but it was honestly so good you should read it even if dark fics aren't normally your thing.

  COMPLETE. When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost. It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything.

** I've been reading some crossovers the last couple of weeks. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28146954/chapters/68966568][Padfoot and Hound]], T, which is a story set during Harry's third year. In it, Kakashi, from the Naruto series, about age fourteen, ends up in the HP-verse. He meets Sirius first right after his escape and helps him a bit before they get separated. Eventually, Kakashi ends up a student at Hogwarts because he's agreed to help out Sirius with his goals and knew from their time together that it's where he'd show up again eventually.

It's updating pretty steadily. At least once a week and so, far, is pretty interesting. Kakashi is hiding a lot about himself and coming up with stuff on the fly and, at times, is funny with the stuff he spouts to cover up things he does or doesn't know. It's also kind of neat seeing how he navigates Hogwarts without magic but convinces people he belongs with his ninjutsu. As well as how he get along with various characters.

Sirius and his struggles to get to Harry and protect him/kill Peter are also a part of the story. He also muses pretty heavily on Kakashi the longer things go on and has, at this point, even figured out Kakashi is not of the HP-verse. So that's another cool layer.

I've also read, but not as much, of another HP and Naruto crossover. This one is called [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26686966/chapters/65093611][Sticks and Stones]], Gen. It also is about fourteen-ish-year-old Kakashi going to the HP-verse. In this one, he's sent there on a mission to protect Harry and it's set in Harry's fifth year. Up until the point I've read, he's still kind of just aquainting himself with the characters who are unsettled by him overall for various reasons.

I'm hopeful it will comtinue to be interesting once they go to Hogwarts.

** I occasionally fall into the trap of wanting to read George or Fred fics. For some reason, the quality of writing of those is usually higher - perhaps because twins are a challenge to write, or they aren't popular main characters, I'm not sure - and get sucked into reading that instead of doing, well, anything. I can't help it, the way people react to the twins in many fics, with happiness, delight, and a neverending bucket of forgiveness for their ridiculous pranks can make me well up even when what I'm reading is just harmless fun / not particularly emotional or romantic at all. There's a fic (maybe Arithmancer) where George picks Hermione up and makes her laugh in the dining hall? That's the kind of scene that sticks with me for years and fills me with jealousy for the way I am in real life - not such a bringer of joy who can get away with this kind of thing. Anyway. Give me your non slash or incestuous twin fics please!

Today, I read all of [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14005107/chapters/32250834][Playing with Fire by BlueKat]], an OC/Fred story that is unfortunately not yet finished. I have confidence they will get around to it though! The OC is very fun and realistic for a 16 year old. Maybe occasionally they speak like adults more than the teens they are, but it's very rare, and most of the time is very funny, touching, emotional, etc. It is set during Harry's 4th year, and the summer term just finished. There's also a companion fic for the OC's best friend and George.

A Hermione/George fic I've read before but re-read was the [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/657044/chapters/1197513][Prankster's Apprentice]], a post-war romance between those two where Hermione works at WWW that again, really just treats the characters like human beings, and is just something I really like reading. It's also quite funny, and I like the way they used obscure ingredients for the weird science that occurs.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18651592/chapters/44231980][Snake Shop by Wynnebat]] has Tom Riddle meeting a timetravelling Harry Potter who takes care of him. I enjoyed the fic a lot, although i'm a bit disappointed that it finished where it did. Again, there's a bit of humour, but for the most part what I enjoy is that it's from Riddle's very young point of view, and that a Snake Shop sounds really is the best kind of place for them to hang out in.

One fun fic: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29034237][neither can live while the other is high by scaredcrow]] - cannabis arrives at Hogwarts, but unfortunately Harry's link to Voldemort is not good for his trips.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8770888/chapters/20104951][Mother May I by Esama]] is a great little fantastic beasts fic, that very quickly goes a different way than the first movie did. Newt can tell when someone is an obscurus, thus reacts differently the first time he sees Credence.

I read through what exists of [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25133773/chapters/69162402#workskin][Of Clones and Wizards by Zirakinbar]] because someone asked for star wars fanfic recommendations and I found it again while looking for them. Harry lands in Star Wars, but as a result of Quirrelmort, which means he isn't all that good at magic and not OP. The Clones kind of adopt him, and he becomes a padawan. The plot is really well thought out and Voldemort is an issue, so there's plenty for him to do. The origin of the Sith made me laugh out loud, there's really a bit of everything: action, humour, hurt/comfort, worldbuilding... give it a go! Also has a companion fic with snippets.

Last but not least, it's not a manic phase of reading Harry Potter fanfiction without a good Slytherin!Hermione story, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29980422/chapters/73808532][Aberration by Cocoartist]]. I only wish they'd stuck with the disdain towards Harry a little longer but overall a good fic in the genre. Also, it doesn't drag on, which is always a plus from my point of view.

** I just got into Three Hallows, a Rat, and Redemption, by AverageFish. The prophecy's different, the Hallows are much more important, and most importantly, the crux of the story is about how Peter gets reincarnated as Harry. That premise originally turned me off the idea, but once I actually started reading, I got obsessed. It's pretty serious at the moment, and I don't see the tone changing, but I'd say it's worth the angst.

This is the story of a man who did the wrong things for the right reasons, a man who betrayed everything he was and is now trying to make things right. A Peter reincarnated as Harry redemption fic you didn't even know you wanted. No character bashing---Peter's character is very relatable.

  First-year students at Hogwarts summon Familiars. While most are harmless, some are things a teen shouldn't be in charge of. Carnivorous flower spirits, armored murder-owls and walking incarnations of fury roam the halls of Hogwarts. This is just as bad of an idea as it sounds. Probably even worse. Our "heroes" might just save the world, assuming they don't destroy it first.

** It's a two part story that starts with Harry and Ginny accidently stumbling on a Portkey while cleaning Grimmauld Place during the summer before Harry's fifth year. It has A Harry/Ginny pairing, but we still got a little bit of action on the side with them trying to take down Voldemort. Turns out Regulus actually wanted Sirius to discover his secret, too bad (or maybe good?) Harry and Ginny discover it first.

Part 1 :

** I've read three fab ones over the last few days. I'm quite new to linking things so apologies if the links don't work. Brontide: by Seriously Sam. A post Hogwarts but pre-epilogue Fick, it's great. Focuses on Harry‘s relationship with his family, and his own Demons. I loved the family dynamic within the thick and how well the author manoeuvers Harrys problems, I also love the split points of you, so it's not always focused just on Harry, it's how other characters are perceiving the situations within the thick. Would highly recommend. Shifting lines: by DovahTobi. Marauders at Hogwarts from Remus perspective. It's a series as far as I'm aware and this is the first. Sirius/Remus relationship in further fics. I'm loving it. Beneath a Big Blue Sky: by Eyra. Remus/Sirius and James/Lily. Muggle AU set on a Yorkshire farm. I am in love with this fic. Full of utter sweetness, baby lambs, funny/grumpy animals. Incredible image descriptions and them there's the romance between Remus and Sirius.

If you want the bot to show the summaries, you need to do either linkffn or linkao3, then put something in the paraentheses for it to find the story. Either the title (though that often times finds other stories with the same title), a full link, or the fic's number (the first set of numbers from the URL (I prefer this one personally because it always gets the right story and it is fairly short). This is all assuming the bot is actively working, which isn't a guaranteed thing.

** I spent the past week reading /Remain Nameless/, a Hermione/Draco love story. It's quite well written, very lengthy, and complete. I found that for my tastes it lacked plot beyond their relationship. They never really faced any significant challenges other than relationship drama, and Malfoy was IMO a toxic partner for about the first 1/2 of the book. He is dealing with being a recovered potions addict.

  How did it feel? It felt like he was barely holding it together. She, of all people, should shun him. Or yell at him. Curse him. Spit at him. Take out her wand and blast him off the face of the earth. It was crushing guilt and relief and confusion all at once when he looked at Hermione Granger.The monotony of Draco's daily routine had become both a lifeline and a noose. But this new habit of grabbing coffee with Hermione Granger is quickly becoming a reason to get out of bed and is unfortunately forcing him to re-evaluate his inconsequential existence.Hermione is living her life in fragments, separate pieces scattered about, and she can't find a way to step back and let the full picture form. Why are morning meetings with Draco Malfoy the only thing that make sense anymore?

** Read a fairly long one shot but I enjoyed it anyway.

Hermione jumping through time, but always centred around Remus Lupin.

** I've just finished linkffn(Who Dares Wins by OlegGunnarson)

For anyone that rolls their eyes at the summary, give the first few chapters a shot. I normally associate this entire premuse- Harry's parents are alive and he actually has a brother they neglected him for- with terrible writing, but this is actually pretty well done. Dumbledore, James, and Lily are bashed some but it's not ridiculously bad.

Harry Potter and The Two Flowers by Azaron also started updating again, and that's a pretty good read. Though it's moving a bit slowly.

  A Harry Potter who grew up studying military tactics and strategy uses the attack on the Ministry as an opportunity to lay an ambush of his own - only to learn that his parents are still alive, as well as a twin brother whom Dumbledore calls the true boy-who-lived. And then, things get complicated. Military!Harry. A subversion of DZ2's Prodigal Son Challenge.
