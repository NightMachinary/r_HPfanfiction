I enjoy the concept of having the characters read the books, but all the ones I've found either haven't been updated in forever, are poorly-written (as far as grammar and what-not goes), or feature bashing. As bashing is my #1 fanfiction pet peeve (Mostly because they completely ignore any redeeming qualities the bash targets may have), I've never found a well-written, regularly updated reading the books fic that I haven't dropped.

** There's "The Discovery Series." The next generation reads the books, by themselves. Harry and the others were sparse on the details of the War, so a lot of things take them by surprise.

There's not much in the way of bashing, except for the kids really not liking the Dursleys.

It got taken off Fanfiction.net so this is the best I could do. [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/9307442/1]]

*** I can't find the first one on fichunt. If you've got the fanfiction link in your favs then I could find it from that, I think.

**** Sorry, but fanfiction.net purged most of the Reading the Books stories and because it happened before I learned how to archive...oh wait, I still don't know how to archive, I wasn't able to find it.

** One of the very best one's I've ever read, it hasn't been updated in a while but the author normally does take quite a while anyway so I I'm hopeful. It's a fem!Harry take, but it's actually really well done.

I also know for a fact that some other sites like Quotev and Archive Of Our Own have some but they still don't beat 'Cris Potter's Life".

** I don't remember the titles, but there have been some good ones where Umbridge gets her hands on copies of the series and decides to read them aloud for the entire school, as well as some key Ministry people, and it sort of backfires on her. They really don't have much more bashing of Umbridge or the Ministry than canon does, and even for the good characters, we get to see how other characters react to the actions taken in the books, or how Harry and friends have changed and grown by their responses to their own actions in earlier years.
