:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
i have been going absolutely insane trying to find a hermione/cormac fanfiction based at a muggle summer camp. she starts going there as extra credit for muggle studies, eventually becomes a counselor, she and cormac fall in love and it's overall a really well-written story. does anyone possibly know where i can find it? i've read it a few times on fanfiction.net but i lost my account so i don't have it bookmarked anymore. one scene i particularly remember towards the beginning is draco is there and pushes hermione and cormac punches him... i hope this helps and someone can help me find it! much love <3


** any of these?\\
