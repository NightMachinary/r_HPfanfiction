In recent years, it seems as though canon is no longer as highly regarded. Even outside of this sub, I've seen and heard more and more people criticize HP canon; a lot of whom have legitimate reasons. And overall, it feels like HP is no longer as popular, so what caused this?

Of course, it isn't just one thing. Was it Rowling's comments? An aging fanbase? The rise of social media as a whole? Something else?


** I think a combination of your listed reasons, but the Cursed Child served as some kind of catalyst. Before that, JKR basically was in "couldn't do wrong" land. After that, she seems to have lost her marbles on the fandom. Wizards pooping on the spot, Professor McGonagall in 1927, Aurelius Dumbledore, and many other nonsense tweets have all undermined her reputation.

I think her disregard for worldbuilding consistency in pursuit of some 'exciting' plot has finally caught up to her

***** Honestly the only reason I watched the FB movies was for a young Dumbledore. The second movie was really extremely boring and convoluted. They made the whole story about a kid who we've not even learned to like or love --- he's about as interesting as the ikea armchair I'm sitting in. And anyway they basically made the whole movie about him searching for his true identity or true parentage or whatever. Who cares. Honestly. It's their responsibility as writers to make us care about who bis parents are, and not by telling us that he's got some fascinating story, but by making us care about the character enough that we go ‘huh wonder who his dad is'.

And then there's the fact of the threads in the second FB film finally coming together... and finally, after like two hours we're told this kid is Corvus Lestrange and wow --- only less then a second later it's contradicted by Leta and suddenly it's turned into a season of the tv show the Blacklist. More questions, less answers, less fucks that I care.

So these plot twists are all about the ‘gotcha' effect and not the ‘oh shit what happens next' kind.

******* Eh, I think it has something to do with the way storytelling as a whole developed here. The way that it was explained to me is that while in the east stories tend to be divided in arcs where the MC has to deal with separated problems with the occasional interference of other past or future plots that are mostly unconnected to the current arc in the west story telling is mostly based around the “great man” theory which puts both good and evil sides under the authority and power of a MC.

Fantastic Beasts is set around a time where the obvious “Bad guy” would chronologically be Grindelwald, so they used him to keep the plot mostly under a linear set of circumstances in which either a character is on “Dumbledore camp”, “Grindelwald camp” or trying to decide between those. If it is or not a good way of telling a story in such a (relatively) short time (making a rough approximation we could say that the complete set of FB movies would have around 7:30/8:30 hours all in all, yeah, it is a lot, but not that much) is up to debate.

Honestly it gets kind of annoying because Newts involvement in the story feels forced. It really came from left field, we saw in DH the bare details of the war and Newt wasn't mentioned at any moment then, so him being suddenly the protagonist of the story seems weak. If they wanted to tell the story of the war (which I would love to watch) they should have told it with other character as MC, preferably Dumbledore himself as he would have much more reason to be involved and had a much higher stakes at it than Newt's vague love story and general activism (which really isn't that big of a point inside the war plot).

Newt's story would potentially go much smoother if focused on a villain that had more to do with creatures, maybe a group of radicals that are trying to get magical creatures under heavy control or trying to exterminate some species. The problem of the movies is that they try to cobble together two vastly different stories, with the one with higher stakes but less personal connections to the MC all but completely overshadowing the other that becomes little more than a side-plot.

I'd rather know the definitions of words than google them all, or know trivia instead of needing to look it up, or have many other basic skills. Considering the things wizards do have automated, like massive magazine printers or fire travel, I don't think a spell so simple as a vanishing spell is at all taxing on any witch or wizard once they've learnt it. Once plumbing was invented, no vanishing spell would be required and no enchanted chamber pot. Before that, enchanting a chamber pot in advance to vanish your shit vs vanishing your shit has such a negligible difference in effort that I don't see why wizards would only ever restrict themselves to chamber pots when they have the freedom to shit anywhere. Enchanting an object also requires magic and effort. In conclusion, I firmly believe wizards and witches shat where they pleased like birds, and that chamber pots were a restrictive means of bowel release because they limited the places your shit could go and they don't actually reduce your magic expenditure because you still have to keep reenchanting it whenever the enchantment fades.

** I know this may be unpopular, but while I do sincerely love HP canon, I've been reading so many fanfics for years that I actually have a preference for fanon in certain cases (or can't remember which is fanon or canon), or I actually prefer the story/character building of some fanfics over the read books. I will always love and cherish my memories of reading the books and my physical copies (especially my wife's illustrated editions) and will probably read those to my kids when they are old enough. I just personally prefer the world building and plots of some fanfics to canon.

I would also hazard that a much larger proportion of the fandom each year either came in from the movies or is movies-only, and those have a lot to critique in them - while still also having a lot of good in them.

The third reason would be, as mentioned already in the thread, JK Rowling herself making the choice to transition (ha) from being generally an open and welcoming figure who explicitly blessed fanfiction and fandom expansion, to something of a loose cannon - which now causes people to perhaps come at her work with a more critical eye rather than kindly giving her the benefit of the doubt regarding certain decisions made in the bulk of the story, because we liked and trusted her implicitly.

****** Firstly, you're deliberately twisting the definition of transphobia, which is "a dislike of or prejudice against transsexual or transgender people". This is commonly accepted. going "phobia = fear and we're not scared of trans people we're just prejudiced against them" has the same energy as getting scared if someone says "wow, that's a wicked car" because wicked used to mean sinful and witchy. Language evolves, get over it or stick to speaking latin.

Either you have: A.) never heard anyone talk about this issue, in which case you probably should do any amount of background reading before posting, or B.) are aware of its current usage and connotations but refuse to publicly accept that, for whatever reason, and so argue in bad faith about real, vulnerable people on the internet to stop the people who are actually harming these real, vulnerable people from being identified as prejudicial bastards. I hate to tell you this, but it is wrong to protect bigots from being called bigots.

Secondly, no. "hating them because they are trans" is not a valid worldview. Hating anybody because of an arbitrary difference is never valid. Just in case you didn't know [[/u/Lynix2341][u/Lynix2341]] valid means something that is based in logic and fact. Prejudice is inherently illogical, and there is no factual, peer-reviewed piece of scientific evidence that suggests "every single transgender person ever is doing something worthy of scorn.

A valid opinion you don't agree with would be "cars 2 is the best movie I've ever seen" because of the FACT that art is subjective and the logic that they've seen every movie they've ever seen, and this has been the one they've most enjoyed viewing",

Hating trans-people is an invalid opinion, that can lead to discrimination, violence, and death, which you feel the need to defend from being called out in frank-terms. And yet supposedly don't support.

It is not the majority, but it is a viewpoint that they have, because it was how they were raised.

And, can transgender people reproduce naturally? No. They cannot. Therefor, they are breaking the natural convention, and disliking things that go against natural convention is something that it would be valid to hate, but only if we needed them to survive. However, we don't need them as a species to survive, therefore it is irrational to be prejudiced against them.

Additionally when I finally started Fantastic Beasts I started to consider it tentatively canon but then she goes and shows that she doesn't actually know her own characters or timelines as McGonagall pops in that series, when Tom Riddle Jr. aka Voldemort was supposed to be born in 1926 (I.e. the first Fantastic Beasts movies) whereas from all the clues she has dropped along with the other characters estimated ages, McGonagall actually attended Hogwarts after Voldemort graduated.

Let's not include the whole chamberpots and stuff. She started to give extra info and while yes, fans were hungry for that, there wasn't much consistency in it and fans became pretty dubious of whatever she was going to write next.

Also she is blaring out her personal opinions on social media platforms and is a much looked on figure by almost every generation(so imagine the effect her words are having). I won't go into that as it will start up another debate(I do NOT agree with her, period.)

Additionally people are getting disenchanted with her works as they grow up. Why? You will find that she has actually made quite the morally grey(shall we say) characters. Fanfiction especially has been blaring up about that. The Dursleys, Dumbledore, etc.

While her world is still wonderful, inconsistencies and incidences swept morally under the rug are souring the perception of her readers further.

(By traditional fanfic I mean your classic 2000s era shipfics, drabbles, slice-of-lifes. Heavy on romance and introspection, low on content changes. Draco Trilogy and stuff like that, not magical exploration or plot-driven epics.)

I think that's because most people here, including me, are second-generation fans who weren't even alive when the books started coming out and have almost no clue what the fandom was like back then.

JKR's bigotry, Cursed Child, etc. probably has to do with it, but in general the world has become a /lot/ more tolerant since 2000 and people tend to be less judgmental in general, particularly on the internet. Ships don't mean as much anymore (and moreover aren't canon-compliant) so long after the series have ended and people typically won't get on their high horse about it, which creates more room for plot-driven stuff that distances itself from canon. If you look at the most followed updating fics on FFN, it would be pretty hard to imagine DP&SW, Junior Inquisitor, or Prince of Slytherin so high on that list around 2000 or so.

It's also worth noting that in many fanfic communities, the platform drives the trends - since 2010 or so HP fanfic, particularly this sub, has conglomerated around FFN, which tends toward non-canon and plot-driven fics. The age of 15+ fanfic sites in the 2000s, where each one had a very specific purpose, is long gone.

#+end_quote

Speaking as one of the few first-generation fans here, I definitely think so.

2nd-gen fans are also a new breed of fanfic writers and readers. Grimdark, rational! and more densely built worlds and fantasy AUs are much stronger prospects now than they were 10-20 years ago, across multiple fandoms. Not to be gender essentialist, but from my observations a big part of that /is/ the influx of men into particularly fanfiction-creation spaces, which previously were definitely female-dominated.

Not to say that gender inherently informs interests, but creators who will have been more likely to have consumed different media as kids and teenagers are able to pull different elements out of the source text to 'what if' and do that in different directions from those who have grown up on a completely different set.

E: For example, the atmospheric rise of Harry /essentially female OC (Daphne, female!Slytherin, Tonks, Fleur) over the last 10 years compared to the pairings that dominated in the 00s - Sirius/Remus, Harry/Draco, James/Sirius and Harry/Snape. The simple reason as to why Daphne, Fleur etc. weren't previously as fleshed-out is because they weren't characters that appealed to the majority of the fanfic fandom at the time, when that majority was heterosexual women with a preference for male-pairing characters - which, due to Harry Potter's fairly gender-balanced core cast, meant reaching into the past or using the adult supporting cast for main pairings - or going for hero-enemy pairs. But, to readers and authors coming in wanting to write a female love interest, the series has many options of characters to whom depth can be added - and indeed, I'd argue that many of the Haphne stories that we get now are essentially at their core similar stories to Drarrys.

E2: When I think about it, even the difference in how some Harry/Hermiones tend to be written now compared to how they were previously - when female authors wrote Harmony pairings they were nearly always from the perspective of "Hermione is the most competent character and the character I identify with the most and so she deserves the main character instead of Ron", whereas newer authors (whether just male or coming from movie canon) are more likely to come from the perspective "/Harry/ is the main character and the character I identify with most and Hermione is more competent/better suited to him/sexier (thanks, Emma Watson vs Bonnie Wright) than Ginny".

**** I was actually going to append my post with the thought that fanfic has grown much less gendered over the years - the whole notion of H/G being "female" and H/Hr being "male" is completely silly at this point. The fics I like lean /very/ second-generation, and I read a lot of both male and female fanfiction authors. I understand this was extremely rare back in the day. The focus away from gender has actually helped moderate the community, and certain things that are acceptable in other fandoms are really unacceptable here. For example, the Worm fandom is almost entirely based on Spacebattles, an extremely male-dominated space, and many of their popular fics have issues with female characters that wouldn't pass scrutiny in today's HP fandom.

I think the emergence of Brandon Sanderson and George Martin as the leading fantasy authors of the 2010s and 2000s, respectively, has also changed the way people think about writing, with many of them using that spectrum of how to conceive a story as a model for writing.

I still think this sub, because of the average demographic of Reddit, doesn't grasp the full world of the fandom, possibly because many first-generation fans are middle-aged women, who are severely underrepresented on Reddit in general. But at least the fandom is probably healthier internally now.

***** I'm not sure whether I'd agree that the fandom is /healthier/ now just because it's no longer female-dominated - speaking as a 1stgenner myself. To me, there isn't really a value judgement associated with that - it simply has changed, and now has a new composition as a result.

But the former structure of the fandom never felt oppressive or unhealthy or anything either - it simply was a different space. One could make the argument that the influx of new fans changing the space is actually a twisting away of the space from its original function and purpose - rather than a balancing of the scales, if that's how you're choosing to view it.

Because the things that women /do/ love and value in general in society are still treated as fringe, and the difficulty to an extent when a space like a fandom gets an influx of new (male, or otherwise) fans, the existing space risks becoming marginalized. For example, this sub has a pretty rocky record with how it treats slash pairing requests and recommendations - which, given the history of the fandom with those as its foundation - could be perceived as quite unfortunate at least.

That's not to say I don't think you make valid points, of course - just some food for thought to go along with.

****** I phrased my point extremely poorly.

As you point out, "healthier" is not the right word. Many of these fanfic communities, many of which were populated by societally marginalized groups, were hurt by each other and particularly in the end by DLP infiltrating and attacking them, and none of those attacks helped their survival.

Maybe what I intended is "more stable." There are not as many communities around, and the ones that are tend to be more inclusive than they once were. Whether that's a result of people leaving the fandom out of choice or feeling like they don't have a place anymore, I don't know - I suspect it's some of both. There's massive room for improvement, and the history of this sub and DLP can't be ignored even if they have gotten better.

Part of the point of my original post was to draw people's attention to the fact that we really don't cover a whole lot of fanfiction on this sub. It has become almost entirely a second-generation sub, and for a sub called "Harry Potter fanfiction," I do think we can do a better job overall of supporting people who want to read or write in any style on this particuar subreddit.

** Can't speak for the larger fandom, but the main reason I've 'soured' on the canon is largely due to issues with the lore and how certain characters are seemingly given a pass by the text when they arguably should be vilified or at least made responsible for their actions. The world of Harry Potter served the series well enough for the plot Rowling wished to tell, but it wasn't well thought out to be frank. Combine this with some narrative dissonance in the actions of characters like Dumbledore, Snape, and Ron with how they end up being viewed by the story. There is a reason why Dumbledore bashing and Ron bashing are popular fictional tropes, because they are treated way too kindly by the source material. Don't think the books are bad necessarily, but due to the fact so many read these when they were young, a lot of these deeper issues were ignored. Rowling's recent transphobic tweets certainly didn't help.

** I'm a bit late to this thread, but I wanted to add something I haven't seen discussed here yet, which is that a lot of it stems from imagining yourself in a different house than Gryffindor. Slytherins and Hufflepuffs really got done dirty in canon, and if you identify with either of those houses, you probably started to see it a lot quicker.

That opens the door to seeing how a lot of background characters, especially the women, like Lavender Brown, Cho Chang, Marietta Edgecombe, etc. got treated really poorly in the main text, and often just for having stereotypically female traits. That opens the door even further to questioning which characters got too good of an edit, and from there it spirals into questioning a lot of what's in the original text.

Oh, and JKR being terrible and insane on the internet. For those of us who stood up for her in the beginning especially (obvi not more especially than trans ppl tho), the recent comments really felt like a slap in the face. I had no problem with Dumbledore being gay, that's definitely the way I read it in the text the first time I read DH; I've had plenty of teachers whose sexual orientation I don't know, and that's fine and normal. She was trolling people all day the day that Pottermore stuff about the toilets happened, like, I thought that was obviously not serious. And I defended her for those things, and I gave her the benefit of the doubt when those early things happened, like liking that one transphobic tweet and saying it was an accident. I trusted her and looked up to her and believed in her, and now I don't. And that's changed the amount of grace I'm willing to give to the text itself and the benefit of the doubt I'm willing to extend to it.

** During my first readings of the series I loved how boundless the world in the book seemed to be, magic was so experimental and versatile, gender norms were very different, because any wanded person dueling another wanded person would be just as deadly as the other. The Weasleys were poor but they weren't starving, they just had to rely on hand me downs. Magic could give you the ability to change whichever thing (superficial) about your appearance that you disliked or that caused you pain. Aging in canon might not be glamorous but there most likely aren't care homes because magic gives you the ability to care for yourself safely pretty much indefinitely.

Of course there were rules but we saw characters think around them or innovate when they needed to, so I apply that same energy to my discussions about the HP world and conversations about canon.

JK Rowling can't break down my door to stop me from saying "Why on earth would there only be one wizarding school in all of South America, and why would it be in the only portugese speaking country of all places? Like wtf that's just dumb. Lmao I guess learn Portugese or you don't get to be a wizard" just like nobody can take my joy from having read and liked HP by saying that I shouldn't because of the Author's political views.

I know I'm usually just posting in this sub for a chance to air out my Kneazel Knationalist propaganda but the idea of canon across all media, I think has been dying out as a whole or rather the strict adherence to the 'rules' of adaptation.

Hell in 20 years or so we could get a grimy reboot of the HP universe on HBO where Harry and Draco are Buddy Aurors who used to have beef in school taking down anything (um I dunno maybe magical Monsanto?) and boy howdy my 50 year old self would watch that. Maybe with my kids? Oh gosh wouldn't that be the time for Drarry to get fanservice attention right in front of them with me having to explain which elements from the greater fandom the show runners pulled from to get the attention of 50 year old horned up fanfic writers.

It wouldn't be canon, but whoever gets to run dead JKR's estate can decide that whatever makes them money is canon and if that means that Harriet Potter happens, or Sexy!Snape or even Slytherin Ice Queen Daphne freakin Greengrass gets her own three part mini series....then that becomes canon and the current purists will be the non canon peeps and so the wheel will turn.

TL;DR all canon is changing across all media. Might be really cool imo to have less and less strict boundaries for what HP and other things can or should be. Also it might be bad but it will at least be.

** These are my major dislikes/confusions with Harry Potter; most could probably be ignored as never completing the films individually or read any canon books. I expect I missed important details and had fanfon colour my response to this.

I remember as a 12 year old not liking Harry Potter and the first film and in later years the rest. I only got into HP fan fiction because of a crossover and realised I preferred fanon to canon. I in fact to this day have not finished any of the films/books from start to finish; cant stomach them to be honest.At the time I could not say why I disliked it; explaining now is complicated but easier.

Harry Potter as a character only acted as a abused child when it suited the plot; it seemed forgotten until it was needed to highlight some plot point or another. His character became what the author/director wanted but never seemed to keep a personality type.

I did not feel Harry grow as a character, it felt forced in lots of places. He did not learn from mistakes is probably simpler to say.

Harry also seemed to love staying uneducated when it came to his life; I don't mean in the sense of dark tomes or powerful ancient lost knowledge but in the regards to his finances/holdings and catching up on what he missed out on. He showed no drive that poor person would have finding vault full of money. For good or ill he showed no interest when it came to steering his life to a better place.

Would have it been difficult to locate easy to learn life hack type magic for his situation.

Would have it killed him to look for ways to fix/alter his clothing. He just seemed so unimaginative when it came to getting a head in life. He got swept by the waves and stayed put not bothering to direct his own life.

Really Ron as a character is probably the best one out of them all, he got his character fleshed out with arcs that showed him growing and coming to terms with his shortcomings. But still Rowling liked to pick the scabs with character flaws. Exaggerate them too.

I really wished they developed more side characters early on as most introduced seemed 2d at best.

Looking at Harry I am baffled how he allowed Ron to act towards others when his early actions should of had produced flash backs to his life before magic.

Hermione just did not gel well with me, her strong willed and opinionated character seemed to have been there only to drive the plot in the direction that would show Harry in the best light.

I still have problems figuring out how Harry became good at defences against the dark arts. From all that I have read(fan-fiction) and little that I have watched it seemed he only put in the bare minimum or what prodding Hermione had done to get him and Ron to learn.

The romantic relationships seemed forced but I will not complain, the foundation could of been set better and hints made to be more natural. I just get the feeling it was planned from the start but not executed well and that comes across as forced.

The adults are characterised as Self-centred people and the only group that acted in anyway believable were the children and villains. I will say that they went for cartoon evil until the later movies.

Dumbledore as a character is wasted, Rowling pretty much ruined him. In trying to make him larger than life character she added inconsistencies into the universe. Should of left him as a war hero and headmaster. Now as the years went on I had questioned what he did with all the seats of power he held.

Did he have any power or were they appointed titles with little to no power available to him? These questions are what made my perception of canon sour.

Suffer from dyslexia and I apologies for any mistakes.

Like that time he found out that he was part welsh, and then wrote A Shadow Over Innsmouth, where the protagonist goes to a village on the coast, discovers that the villagers have been..ehm... badonkadonking the local fish monsters and then by the end discovers that he is part fishmonster himself. He goes on to describe the "innsmouth look" in great detail, which fits racist caricatures of welsh people at the time he lived curiously well.

JKR, in contrast, didn't let the beliefs she holds influence the books back in the day, and it's honestly debatable if she was a TERF when they were written. There's some strangely racist things in the books, like "cho chang", a name which is pretty much just "ching chong chang" but stylized, or "Anthony Goldstein" being jewish with the most jewish name to ever jew, but I have never noticed any transphobia, explicit, implicit or allegorical.

***** It might be debatable if she held those beliefs at the time of writing the books, but you can't ignore the misogynistic language used to describe so many of the women in the series, from the shrill, shrieking, crying, nagging Hermione and arrogant, conceited, snobby, rude, shallow Fleur (up until she gets together with Bill, then suddenly Rowling writes her better, even as the other characters are rude to her) to Rita Skeeter who is described as having large mannish hands, thick fingers, a heavy-jawed face, gold teeth, pencil-thin eyebrows, fake curls, fake nails regularly described as claws, gaudy clothing, etc. The written descriptions of Skeeter are so ridiculously exaggerated, she reads like Rowling was trying to describe a drag queen.

Her negative and closed minded comments are absolutely disgusting and just fucking rude. I get not supporting something. Quietly vote against it and keep your mouth shut.

In fairness, if someone sincerely believes in their own position, then might they not say the same about you, that you could quietly disagree with them and yet say nothing?

The thing about protecting free speech is that you only need the ironclad rule when there are people whom you disagree with, even whose positions you thoroughly hate. When you agree with someone, you don't need the law to protect their right to speak up; it comes naturally. The point of the First Amendment is for the situation where "I disagree with what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it."

So, it doesn't make a lot of sense to say that you are ok with someone believing something but not saying it. If you don't think they should say it, then you ought to be trying to persuade them to change their underlying beliefs.

(Which is also where free speech protects you, btw. A millennium ago, trying to publicly criticise a very wealthy person and persuade them to change their social views would have been a very perilous thing to do. Now, you can go for it without fear.)

**** ..... I feel you misunderstood me. When a person has BILLONS fans of /usually/ children then yes, something like lgbt+ rights is something to keep your homophobic mouth shut about if you don't support it. Ever heard of “keep your opinions to yourself?” Or “If you don't have anything nice to say then don't say anything?” /Especially to children!/ Now should they keep their mouth shut about true injustice?! Like child abuse?! Or r/pe? Absolutely not! But, and if I'm getting downvoted let's go the entire way, but instead of being transphobic what if they were being racist? I'm sure billions of people would have something to say about that. But for transgendered people it's “freedom of speech”? Now, your not saying that, I don't think at least, but some people out there I'm sure 100% are saying that. Who cares about the trans? It's not very common and a lot of people are transphobic. There is a very thin line where freedom ends and harassment begins. I'm saying for *JUST/ movie stars, influencers, people with THOUSANDS of viewers and supporters being YOUNG PEOPLE and mostly UNDERAGE that they should be much more careful what they say/do. And they're learning with this “cancel culture” (that I don't support) that they shouldn't joke about x,y, and z. I was following an actor on Facebook but with his constant every day propaganda to his mostly young, not voting age, audience just pissed me off. I was, personally, there to hear news about his show, and his upcoming shows, to see glimpses into his family life, and some wacky ideas he had at 2am - not be preached at, at only 16 how we were all going to die in flames if X didn't become President. It's sickening and he truly didn't help my anxiety which is why unfollowed him. For famous people with thousands of thousands of followers? Yeah I think they should keep OPINIONS to themselves. I got very heated, sorry, but suicide is a all time high. Children are viciously bullied and adults most the time aren't better. Why can't people keep they're mouth shut about homophobic, racist, bullshit? It's /stupid/ and immature and ridiculous. I support freedom of speech obviously but this kind of stuff just pisses me off.

And what I say to you is, don't stop at "she can be privately wrong but she should keep silent." I think you should explain why her beliefs should change, not just call for them to be quieter.

The UK doesn't, for example (our closest equivalent uses the phrase 'freedom of expression' and makes it clear that shit is limited to 'restrictions (etc) that are necessary in a democratic society').

We have all sorts of laws against people saying you can't incite violence or say dangerous shit (the usual example is 'yelling fire in a crowded theatre') and our culture really doesn't emphasise caring about 'universal free speech' in any regard (generally speaking, we are moving very rapidly towards 'buying your blue jeans and listening to your pop music' territory with the US here).

The people we talk to tend to express more "You're being a dick here, so shut the fuck up, you wanker." kind of opinions. Though they are all young people.

My colleagues, on the other hand, are more the "You're expressing some opinions here, but do you think they're really true? Let's explore them." crowd. More likely to convert a misogynist than defend one's right to be one. :)

As for social media- I don't have a twitter and even if I did I still wouldn't follow Rowling. Her personal beliefs and opinions do not make me enjoy Harry Potter more or less. I listen to heavy metal and some of it was made by people who are not... very nice. So I learned early on to separate the art from the artist. Remember when everyone thought Johnny Depp was abusing his girlfriend? Some people even wanted to boycott the Fantastic Beasts movies and kept defaming Depp. It was ridiculous.

Also when you think about it Pureblood only is the stupidest thing. As many people pointed out that leads to inbreeding since they refuse Muggleborns. I highly doubt there are enough Halfbloods to make it work. Even if you factor in other countries it still would lead to that. Plus what are the chances someone outside of Britian looks up Tom Riddle and find his secret past.

Actually now that I'm ranting, why didn't Dumbledore push that out. He could have easily gave evidence that Voldermort was Riddle. People from his Hogwarts day would have remembered him and backed him up. Then when he denies it pull a America on him. Demand he provide his Birthh certificate. Call him out and force his hand.
