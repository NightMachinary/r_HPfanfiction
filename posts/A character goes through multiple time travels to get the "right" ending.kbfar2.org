Say Sirius still dies, and Harry or another character goes back (again) to try and save him, and doing it and doing it over, to the point where they get confused by the plots/plots start changing because of the mistakes and going back so often?

** That perfectly describes the sequel/companion to /Backwards With Purpose/ by deadwoodpecker, but you'd need to read the first part first. Which I recommend highly, BTW.

** linkffn(The Many Deaths of Harry Potter)

Not exactly what you're looking for, but it's fairly close - the premise is that when Harry dies (which he does a lot, because Voldemort is dangerously competent) he is thrown back in time with his memories.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

  The war is all but over, and the wrong side won. Worse, the Wizarding World's hero and Ron Weasley's best friend died in the fight. When Draco Malfoy offers Ron a way to go back and fix things, he jumps at the chance. But can he anticipate how his changed moves will affect the board? [Trope stew: this fic began as an exercise, an attempt to use problematic or challenging tropes. A meta-discussion of each trope to follow each chapter.]
