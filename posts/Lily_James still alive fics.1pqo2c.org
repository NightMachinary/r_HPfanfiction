I'm looking for great fanfictions that take place after Halloween, where BOTH are still alive, they never thought Harry was dead and no time travel and or dimension hopping is involved. Kinda like "The Family He Deserves" on ffn.

Loking forward to your recs.

  "Lily, it's him! Take Harry and run!" It began the same way, but ended in a very different way. This change caused life instead of death for many. Life altering changes provide the Power The Dark Lord Knows Not. J/L, H/Hr

  Could a chance meeting change history? What would a different Halloween in 1981 mean for wizarding Britain?
