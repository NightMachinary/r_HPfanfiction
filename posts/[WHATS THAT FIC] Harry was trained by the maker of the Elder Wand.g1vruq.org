:END:
Here's the few details I remember:

-Harry didn't go to Hogwarts but had some tutors

-He traded his phoenix wand for a wand made by Greggorovitch or something in Knockturn Alley

-Remus Lupin ended up teaching him defence

-He met Hermione, Neville and (I think) Draco, Blaise and Luna /before/ Hogwarts and though they had diaries to communicate through Harry didn't go with them.

-He had a couple of familars

-possible manipulative!dumbledore and good!snape

-Oh god it sounds like a total powerwank now that I think of it, but i want fics where Harry hides from everyone lmao

Thanks!

Edit: Harry also had his own apartment


** I don't know what this is but I want someone to find it so I can read it too!
