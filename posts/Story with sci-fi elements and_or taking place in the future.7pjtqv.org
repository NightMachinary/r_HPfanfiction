Hello! I'm looking for any good story, that still somewhat follows the canon plot (not necessary but appreciated) but one that has sci-fi elements to it, either as plot points or just in the background, and/or takes place in the future. And by "future" I mean a year that has any other number behind the two other than zero (or even starts with the three or four). Can be a crossover.

PS. NO superheroes or slash.

Totally doesn't follow canon, well IIRC canon did happen but it was in the past and Harry became immortal unlike in canon but other than that... :p

oooh wait nvm I just remembered it wasn't that far into the future... like maybe 100 or 200 years or something. whatever, leaving it here.

  Harry's unspeakably bored, and bored Unspeakables make bad decisions. Like jumping through the Veil of Death, when they're barely even certain it's safe. Now where it goes, on the other hand... That's still a mystery. But hey! Adventure, right?...Right? - Harry steps through the Veil, and into Mass Effect. The Reapers won't know what hit them. MODHarry.
