I'm a picky reader so I don't really variate much between the certain genres I pick, and even then I only read it with specific certifications.

Here are mine:

-Time travel (Harry has to be in his Hogwarts years though)

-Severitus (probably my favourite ever genre. Definitely not Snarry though, ew. I did read "invisible" be DebsTheSlytherinSnakeFan and it's the only Snarry I've ever enjoyed, except I gave up at the mpreg)

-Slytherin! Harry (not to be confused /interchangeable with Dark!Harry)

-Salazar Slytherin fics (either Harry meeting his potrait or a Founders!era fic)

-Abused! Harry (guilty pleasure, I know)

-Harry in his Hogwarts years (idk I scarcely ever want to read either a prehogwarts or posthogwarts Harry)

-Drarry! (I used to read purely for slash but now having drarry in a story is pure privilege. I prefer Hogwarts years ofc)

-WBWL!Harry (not when he joins Voldemort or becomes dark)

-Harry actually applying himself in lessons

-Tomarry time travel fics are my latest craze. NOT to be confused with harrymort

Anyway thanks for coming to my TEDTalk and if you wanna comment your favourite tropes feel free. Likewise, if you have any recommendations for me don't hesitate to link them ðŸ˜‰


** - Slytherin!Harry

- Fics with extensive worldbuilding. I mean, come on, a whole world of magic out there and we barely know about it. Seriously, Rowling?

- Grey!Harry, and I mean truly gray, where he's not evil but not above dirtying his hands and the only things that matter is what HE wants. Try linkffn(4133028)

- Snarky Harry. I just love fics where he's a little shit and gets away with it like linkffn(13460508) or linkffn(5199602)

  Tom Riddle was able to use magic long before he received a wand. In this AU, Harry has the same grasp on his magic...and a hatred for Muggles... Watch the birth of evil. Smart!Dark!Evil!Harry, All 7 Years

  Harry Potter was not above doing whatever it took to get what he wanted. It often meant he'd have to go to extreme lengths to make people suffer for their stupidity, but the results were always worth it. This Harry Potter takes things too literally. ON PURPOSE. A/N: Slytherin-Harry.

** - I like wizarding aristocracy/Noble and/or Ancient Houses, but it's so often done wrong and cringe to write that I might as well dislike it. I dislike Harry being a Lord minus exception and if he is he has to only be the Lord to House Potter and it has to be average in the hierarchy at most when he starts.
- I don't exactly know if its a trope or not, and if it is it may be multiple, but I like when the wizarding world and population are seemingly bigger than in canon. For example: more alleys than Diagon and Knockturn, bigger Hogsmeade (or seemingly bigger, some stories are able to imply by writing about residential areas that Hogsmeade isn't just the Main Street with Honeydukes and the Three Broomsticks).
- Canon compliance until deviation point(s) except if you say, write about another wizarding country and as a native you feel you could make it more interesting and true to the country's culture. But if suddenly you change Pansy Parkinson's entire personality and background because you want your Muggle-born female OC to have a friend in Slytherin, than you lost me.
- Different Triwizard Tournament. Could simply be different tasks or you keep the first because it's logical but change the other two because the audience and judges see nothing. Can be additional champions for each school, which makes Crouch Jr's job easier. Can even be an additional school (you must change the Tournament's name, though). Anything to make fourth year into something else than a rewrite of canon.
- Chamber of Secrets and Heir of Slytherin but with a twist. Lucius can put the journal into someone else's things. The attacks can be more lethal and different than petrification so as to throw Dumbledore off. I read a story in which a Slytherin seventh year made attacks in the name of Slytherin and announced the opening of the Chamber of Secrets way before Halloween because the Muggle-born OC was in Slytherin and he wanted to get back at the Muggle-borns. After the diary started the attacks the mood in the castle was very different than in the books. At some point the Diary was able to contact the random attacker and they worked together. It must have been the best version of CoS that I read.
- Different and/or more protections for the Philosopher's Stone.
- More teachers for the core classes and staff in general and more NEWT optional classes than only Alchemy (you can at the very least add Magical Healing and Basic Curse-Breaking).
- Similarly to my last point, more in-depth and detailed curriculum for classes. You can add more to certain classes than others, but it'd be fun if you added just a bit to each class.
- Fanon Ancient Runes and Arithmancy and Useful!Astronomy. Astronomy is so useful in myths and legends and was one of the most useful sciences during the Antiquity until the early modern period and is even hinted at in canon.

- Additional and original subplots. I think it makes a story tenfolds more interesting when you have the characters do things they never did in canon, particularly when you're writing about an OC. they must do things other than school work and participate in the main plot, write about it.
- More names. I absolutely love when authors seemingly enlarge the student body, and it can be just as simple as making a big list of random names and having someone name them in passage without them becoming major or even secondary characters. You'd probably not use all of them, but not every character that interacts with your mains have to be major or canon. you can have a random telling x teacher wants to see them or have x teacher finding z and y students snogging in a broom closet after curfew while Harry is sneaking under his invisibility cloak.
- Smarter antagonists for your smarter protagonists.
- Exile. Voldemort, his Death Eaters and other possible allies took over magical Britain and the good guys and the British Ministry go into exile. A bit like how France and the BeNeLux did in WW2.
- International wizarding affairs and important ICW. The ICW has canonically more power than the UN and can and will intervene faster than the UN.
- Multiple Azkaban escapees/ multiple succeeding Azkaban break-outs in PoA.
- Visible Board of Governors. I want to see the Governors actually do something and work with Dumbledore to hire new professors deal with the Chamber of Secrets situation and possibly intervene in the work-outs of the Triwizard Tournament.

** Here's my addictions to the list:

-Snarry, ONLY if harry goes back in time to young Snape.

-TriWizard Tournent rewrites

-Harry goes to Hogwarts later (mostly at 4th year) for some reason

-Harry not being on oblivious idiot for once

-Slytherin Harry with Draco friendship

-SOMETIMES manipulative Dumbledore and good Voldemort if its well written which is very rare

-Time travel if Harry goes back either to Tom or Snape but NEVER to his parents or if he does they are not nice/bullies. I read one where Lily was also an asshole and very mean girls type diva and it was not very good but I enjoyed that.

** - More British Wizarding Culture with Lordship and even Royalty and its consequence on Custom and Government.
- Harry that is not a puppet but one that does know the chessboard more than Dumbledore
- Harry and Salazar in all its forms be it Time Travel, Portrait, Ghost or other means and forms of relationships be it mentor to romantic.
- Dark or Gray Slytherin Harry that is the epitome of cunning and ambition without a ounce of Gryffindorish tendencies.
- Harry don't kill the Basilisk
- harry paired with a boy or girl that is not from Light Families or Neutral Families. Yes I want someone from the Dark.
- Harry restoring dark magic course and ancient magical course at Hogwarts by being heir to one or multiple founders.
- Harry very early on the Wizengamot without help.
- Harry very different from his parents and having traits that his parents would have perhaps disowned him for.
- Harry that is not friend with Ronald, Hermione Granger nor Greengrass.
- Harry schooled at Dumstrang after he learns from Hagrid of Dumbledore having his Gringotts Trust Vault Key and so his guardianship.
