The diary horcrux retained most of its humanity compared to the other horcruxes and Lord Voldemort himself and having spent sometime in solitary confinement (in the diary), I'm curious as to how the diary and Bellatrix's relationship with each other be like.


** Not really what you're looking for, but [[https://hp-backtosmut.livejournal.com/6184.html][this]] has Bellatrix interacting with the diary and it's one of my all-time favorite one-shots. (As evidenced by the fact that I still remember it more than a decade after it was written.)
