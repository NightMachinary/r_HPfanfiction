Looking for fics like [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127417][Saving Harry]], [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=130353][Path Diverged]] and its [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=130365][sequel]], that focuses on Harry healing from his stronger than canon PTSD with the help of his friends and/or found-family.

Preferences for Harry/Ginny, other canon ships, no bashing, and pre-DH.


** An Hour of Wolves by thebiwholived [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14164617]]

Absolutely gut wrenching. Eventually Hinny, but right now Harry is just hurt and dealing with a lot of mental issues

There's also [[https://wizard-trauma.livejournal.com/]] although they're not all PTSD-focused

*** I neither like or dislike Serveritus, I think it would have to depend on the quality of the fic.

Edit: I'm not at all interested in fics where Snape is Harry's biological father. Adoptive or bust.

** Have you read Melindaleo's works on SIYE? Harry Potter and the Power of Emotion was written post-OotP and has a completed sequel, Harry Potter and the Curse of the Damned. Incredible stories, excellent doses of PTSD in both.

Also, I love that you're reading my Path Diverged stories! Next chapter will go up this weekend, I promise.

** Here's one you might enjoy. It's still being written, currently around 250,000 words:

[[http://archive.hpfanfictalk.com/viewstory.php?sid=721][After Destiny]]

All of the main characters are struggling with a lot of stress and trauma from the war. Canon ships and fully canon-compliant.

** Not Harry, but Ginny. However, it is a very good story in my opinion (it persuaded me, that fanfiction stories could be as good as “normal” literature) linkao3(Inner Demons by serendipity_50).

  Long-distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances, but Harry and Ginny don't have the luxury of living normal lives. Their relationship is put to the test when Ginny returns to school and Harry stays behind to continue his Auror training. Ginny soon realizes her greatest challenge may be in coming to terms with Harry's fame and dangerous line of work and deciding if she can make the sacrifices needed to be part of his life. Sequel to Starting Over. (COMPLETE)
