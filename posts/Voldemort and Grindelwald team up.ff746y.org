Exactly what the title says, anybody ever read one that has Voldemort breakGrindelvalt out of Nurmengard maybe in the 60's? After his Albania excursion, team up and create the fiercest group of baddies in the wizarding world. This would have to make Voldemort not so proud like he is in canon so he is willing to do such a thing.


** A Writing Challenge (Prompt) I'd written a while back had this. It was called 'Among Titans', but unfortunately, no one responded. :(
