Hi, All! I just started using A03 quite a bit for my fic search. I like the "tag" feature no there. Makes things pretty simple. However, I am a "canon" shipper. I ship mostly Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione with other canon pairings.

For smoe reason, if I search Harry/Ginny, I find that most of the fics are also Harry/Draco. I am not a fan of this ship at all. It is just unrealistic to me... But anyway, how do I avoid this using AO3? I love it as a database, but this gets frustrating.

I am also open to other pairings with Harry if they seem realistic, but it's so irritating when literally almost EVERY fic is Harry/Draco....


** In the 'Search within results' box, include the following:

-"M/M" -"Draco" -"Snape" -"Lucius" -"Avengers" -"Thor" -"Sherlock"

That should filter out most of the boy-love for the boy-who-lived.

Thank you! I didn't know you could do that. Awesome!
