Do you know some good portrayals of Hermione where she is actually her canon self? Where she isn't her movie's counterpart or a OC with her name slapped on?


** I think Slide does a pretty great job in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4327485/1/Renaissance][Renaissance]] (which, btw, also contains a great in-character Ron).

For something completely different, there's also the sweet one-shot [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13258502/1/You-Only-You][You, Only You]] by Bowtruckles, who is very good at writing in-character Romione.

I also think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12919788/1/The-Cactus-and-the-Toad][The Cactus and the Toad]] captured Hermione really well, but she's not the main character in that fic.

** My readers enjoy my portrayal of her here. She's full of righteous indignation and has no patience for fools.

#+begin_quote
  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?
