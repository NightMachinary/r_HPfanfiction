I personally really liked it. It's so fucked up, and it draws you in. It's definitely in my top 5 HP fanfics of all time.


** Holy fuck what the fuck did you just have me read. That was honestly, one of the most fucked up fanfics I've ever read. And now I have to favorite it cause it's so well written. That ending though, I mean holy shit what the fuck.

** It's well written but very disturbing. Even more disturbing is that it is true to life in a way that many HP fanfics aren't.

** That was disturbingly good. And I do mean emphasis on disturbing. Anyone have any idea if someone ever tried to continue it?

*** I don't think so. No sequel could live up to this though

**** Maybe so, though I'd sure love to see someone try.

** That was...something.

It's wonderfully written and brilliantly disturbing. I really liked the pacing. The point of view switching was bit clunky at first but it drew me in enough that I stopped noticing it.

Going to go read something light and happy now though.
