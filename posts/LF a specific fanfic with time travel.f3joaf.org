Looking for a fic that I read years ago with time travel or dimention travel with Hedwig. Draco's ghost went with him. Also harry can apparate like a pheonix in the fic. It had daphne and fleur as harry's romantic interests.

Also harry trains daphne in this fic and fleur is stalking harry because she is suspicious of him :() sorry i cant quite remember more but i loved it since it was one of the first fics that I've read that got me hooked on HPfiction.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

  It all went wrong. Harry is locked away in Azkaban for decades as Voldemort destroys and conquers the magical world and beyond unchallenged. However, Voldemort's greatest strength will be used against him, and Harry is sent back in time with one mission: to kill the Dark Lord before he rises again.
