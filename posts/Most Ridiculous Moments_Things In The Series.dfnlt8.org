  The wand should only be passed on via murder right?
#+end_quote

No, the ownership of the wand is transferred by defeating its previous owner. Of course Voldemort would have the misconception that defeat equals murder.

**** The history of the Elder Wand is a bloody one. Most of it's owners took it by murdering the previous one. But the change of ownership does not need murder. Grindelwarld took the wand from Gregorovich without killing him, and nothing say he was not the master of the wand.

This was expressly rejected by Ollivander in the books (and films as well). Grindewald got the wand from Gregorovich by theft, and Dumbledore didn't kill Grindewald either.

***** Because it was set up in the Story of the Three Brothers that that was how the wand was passed on, by killing the previous owner (thus the name Death Stick) then later in the same book Rowling backtracked it to make it so the wand could change allegiance without having to kill the previous wielder.

My entire issue is that Grindelwald, Dumbledore, Draco and Harry didn't have to kill their predecessors to claim the wand even though Rowling claimed earlier in the book that they did...

It's almost as though old fairy tales aren't 100% accurate.

#+end_quote

She didn't backtrack, the protagonists learned new information. It's almost as if characters in mystery novels don't have access accurate information 100% of the time. Funny how that works, eh?

Rowling never claimed that. YOU (incorrectly) assumed that an old fairy tale was 100% accurate. That's your problem, not Rowling's.

******* In a world of magic where it's possible to fly on broomsticks and talk to ghosts forgive me for taking information I received at face value. Especially when the Elder Wand is a set of three, set up in said fairytale, and the other two in the set operate exactly how they were described to... You're literally pointing a finger at me a claiming, "HA! You're the idiot for thinking J K Rowling told you the truth!" My guy, she established in the book that the Elder Wand passed on its allegiance via murder then later retconned it out.

Narrative-wise she set up a premise for the wand and quickly shied away from it in order for Harry, Draco (and Dumbledore) to get their hands on it without having to get their hands dirty. She literally set something up and ran away from it for the sake of her main characters.

Forgive me for thinking it's a bit ridiculous and not liking it.

So Pettigrew actually was murdered by Sirius Black? Hagrid really was the Heir of Slytherin? Barty Crouch jr did die in Azkaban? There are so many examples of the protagonists receiving wrong or misleading information, I could spend all listening them.

Once again, the Harry Potter books are mystery novels, and therefore, not everything they hear is correct. Unless you're going to tell me every twist and surprise Rowling made was a retcon or mistake, your argument holds no weight.

I'm sorry, but this is really dumb. If she really was retconning the Elder Wand, why not, you know, edit the chapters? We're not talking about her retconning something from books 1-6, it's literally all in the same book. If I made a mistake in a story, I wouldn't retcon it in a later chapter, I would just go back and edit it out. Why would she leave a major mistake like this in the book? Your argument makes no sense.

The characters literally started picking apart the unlikely occurrences in the fairy tale immediately upon reading it. Their source for even believing that three real items existed was Xenophilius Lovegood, not known for total accuracy (to put it mildly). And in the vast majority of cases, defeat and death went hand in hand, so the fairy tale probably wasn't wrong about how the Elder Wand was previously passed down.

That's not "established" nor does it require a retcon.
