** Most of them are a mashup with the HP world and Marvel world being the same world which makes the story automatically crap unless it's crack.

Also way too many of them are Tony Stark adopting Harry Potter somehow.

  Steve has a routine, and god help him if he's going to break that routine for anyone - yes, that includes you, Tony. Enter a local barkeeper with a penchant for the occult and the gift of good conversation. EWE, not slash, just a couple of guys and a few hundred drinks. Rated for fear of the thought police.

** Well it was unfortunately never finished (and the guy posting said it was missing only one chapter) and is a bit of a crackfic but I still loved "Terminal Justice" which is a HP/DC crossover (with elements from the Justice League (Unlimited) animated series (and if you know the series well you can clearly see the references). It's a sequel (not from the original author though) to Make a Wish (from Rorschach's Blot) in the Mr Black Fanfiction Universe linkffn(11965672)

  A slightly different encounter with Quirrell at the end of first year leads to new problems, new abilities, and a gateway to the extraordinary. A HP/Avengers crossover that respects the timelines while throwing in new twists and characters you may not have seen coming. It starts slow, but will speed up significantly at the beginning of Second year. Enjoy!

** There are quite a few Marvel Crossover fics that I like. Just saying these are all pretty long and are pretty much about Harry becoming an avenger. I'll just list them here: Child of the Storm: linkffn(8897431)

*** I find Avengers: Battleground to be quite bad.

The author switches between present and past tense throughout the /entire/ fic, despite how many complaints they've gotten about it. I believe the author has acknowledged this themselves, yet they continue doing it.

There are /numerous/ phrases and outright paragraphs that get repeated. Harry rants to Nick Fury about muggles killing wizards like 5 different times, and each time, Nick Fury asks the same damn questions. It's as though the author completely forgets that he already wrote this part.

I also don't think the story actually diverges at all. Despite Harry's extraordinary abilities, such as repairing all of New York's damage with a single spell, he still isn't capable of changing events and we get the stations of canon throughout it.

I'm honestly very surprised it's gotten as many followers as it has.

  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.

** I tried to not have any repeats from the others listed, but here is the list I gathered.

Unfortunately, there's not a lot of DC crossovers, but a couple are:

- Heroes Stick Together: linkao3(9580523)
- Robins, Sparrows, and other Gotham Dwelling Songbirds: linkao3(10116155)

In the Marvel category, there's a lot more to choose from:

- Mistletoe - complete: linkao3(6915793)
- Transliterations*: linkao3(1047766)
- No Single Road but This One - complete: linkao3(3613548)
- That Blue Voodo Alien That You Do (Please Stop, Begs Harry): linkao3(11907681)
- Turned Around in Time: linkao3(3898957)

*Transliterations by Shuu-M (Lyzaander) is my favorite on this list, but needs an AO3 account to read; the author had issues with FF comments. Unfortunately, when they made the transfer from FF to AO3, they choose to only upload some of the chapters they had written.

  Harry's done with wizards, but he still wants to help; by now the urge is practically burned into his DNA. The Justice League gives him that chance.

  Harry Potter united the Hallows and, in doing so, became the Master of Death. A totally meaningless title... right? Perhaps not. It turns out, Harry passed a job interview and the responsibility doesn't come with the perks you'd expect. Eternal youth? Nope. Invulnerability? Think again. Time-travel? Sure, but what's the point when changing the future is impossible? And yet, resignation isn't an option, because the universe is a game and it has rules: you can't win, you can't break even, you can't stop playing. At least, that's the case in Harry's home universe. There's another one. It comes with superheros and mutants and whistling blue aliens. A new dimension, with access to the past and future, and perhaps enough flexibility to change. This story blends the entire Marvel cinematic universe with JK Rowling's. I won't just be rewriting the plots. Anything is fair game. Brace yourselves.

**** Well after Harry arrives from the Phantom Zone and meets the Fantastic Four, he teaches at the Xavier's mutant school for a bit. He doesn't like Xavier's or Magneto's solution to the mutant problem so he sets off on his own third path, hence the title. He goes at this from multiple angles. He gets rich and gains influence by creating a company that sells some magical healing stuff, but only to countries favorable to mutants. He also forms a group of superheroes that defends the Earth from threats and uses the visibility of mutants from his group to further his cause. He teams up with Doctor Doom and Mr. Fantastic and hires Carol Danvers to help with planetary defense against the Kree empire. There are a lot of different plot threads woven throughout the narrative. Utilizing tons of various characters that the Marvel universe has to offer. Harry also gets in a polyamorous relationship with Ororo, Jean Grey, Emma Frost and eventually Hela (comic Hela). There's a whole Asgardian plot happening with the Shadows Above All (I think that's their name) controlling the Asgardians towards Ragnarok. And a bunch of other stuff, the fic is almost 1.6 million words, there are almost too many plot threads to name but the author is somehow able to keep track of them all.

I just really like how the author is able to combine all the various elements of Marvel comics together coherently. Like I have only ever seen the MCU and some of the other movies, never read the comics, and it is relatively easy for me to follow and introduces parts of the Marvel universe I was never aware of. Off the top of my head, the fic has included elements of Fantastic Four, mutant, Hellfire Club, Kree, Savage Land, Sinister, Selene Gallio, Shield and Sword, Asgardians, and Doctor Strange. The relationship stuff is also well written and as realistic as a relationship between 4 or 5 people can be. It is not a harem fic. I just think this fic as a whole is amazing, and it is still being updated too with massive chapters.

**** Its got a crapton of not terrible harry potter wrecking shit in the marvel universe. Hes overpowered as heck, but as far as i can tell, its a superman type of overpowered rather than a marty stu type op. there is wish fulfillment, but also evil characters we see that are doing shit that keeps the story tense enough to be interestibg. It toes the line with power for sure though. Of course, harry potter magic is broke asf anyways.

the chapters are long as heck, the story is long as heck, but its not a chore to read when you are looking to spend that much time reading anyways.

As a wish fulfillment fic, its pretty easy to follow, and generally a good chill read to spend a good few weeks just going through the content. Sure, theres plot, but its about as important as the rest of the stuff.

I enjoy catching up with the story when i have a weekend with nothing to do but read an easy to follow wish fullfilment fic.

** Chapters 4, 19, 29, 32, and 45 of linkffn(9900528) take place in marvel fusions or crossovers mostly. The mechanism for dimension travel in 19 and its sequel 45 is my favorite thing i may ever write and i really want to continue it someday. It also gave me the idea of "a snog of fire and ice" where bobby drake and johnny storm are otp.
