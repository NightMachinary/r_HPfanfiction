Ah. To be young and enthralled with the wonders of a website,and this one in particular. One of the most memorable fanfictions for me was a badly written first year one where Harry, Ron, Draco, Neville and Hermione are given their own house LMAO. And it was called unity or something. Not trying to bash an authors work but...

Anway. I'm sure that there's /got/ to be some good fanfiction out there. Did any stick out to you in particular?


** On Wattpad? None that I'm aware of. Either there's genuinely nothing worth reading there, or there's too much garbage to sort though in order to find something good.

** Sadly wattpad seemed to slowly loose all true writers in the past few years.
