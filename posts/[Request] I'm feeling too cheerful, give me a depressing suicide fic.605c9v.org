IDK why I suddenly want to ruin my good mood and read a depressing possibly angst filled fic in which Harry/Snape/Hermione?/Ron/AnybodyButDraco commits suicide for some reason. In summary: A good fic in which the main character who isn't Draco commits suicide and the fic deals with the reactions of the remaining characters. For example, say Harry off'd himself, I'd expect the fic to deal with the reactions of Ron, Hermione, possibly Snape, etc.

The only fic I've read that deals with this was a terrible fic I don't remember the name of in which Snape commits suicide (in his Hogwarts years, after the werewolf "prank" and in doing so somehow invokes some sort of "ritual" in which he gives magic a personified physical body (???) which then goes and summons a bunch of embodiment of other things like Justice (??????!?!?) and all around had terrible grammar.

Preferably no Slash, and no AUs. This event has to be the divergent point from canon.

Thanks for any replies

** linkffn(Too Young To Die). Not gonna lie. The main character is edgy and arrogant, there are lots of action scenes, and it is the quintessential Dark!Harry. No suicide, but despite all that, this story messes with me particularly because you get a front seat view of someone spirlling into addictions, self-destructive behavior and evil, for the sake of ends justify the means. No matter how dislikable Harry is in it, it is hard to watch someone systematically destroy every piece of their life and future, by fixating on an impossible task.

*** The story is good because Harry isn't even all that unlikable. He had a shitty childhood that ended with the death of the only family member he loved. From there it is a downward slope of immorality that culminates in his eventual success, shortly before discovering that Dumbledore was the reason for his entire life path.

But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
