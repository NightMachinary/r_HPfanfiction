Hello all! I know! I know! Please forgive me a bit of self promotion for a moment. Although, if I'm being honest, I'm not so much promoting myself as I am offering myself up to your criticisms, impressions and opinions. Allow me to explain.

I am currently entrenched in a long-term fanfiction project that I have been thinking about for years. I believe that I have now finally reached a skill level to do it justice, and I believe that I may have finally achieved the discipline necessary to see it through. The project is */The Ballad of Celeste Lestrange/*, a full re-write of the series with a primary focus on an original character, that being the (completely legitimate) daughter of Bellatrix and Rodolphus Lestrange.

Of note about the series (because I am aware that shoddy canon rehashes abound in the fandom), I am priding myself in significantly altering at least one aspect of every year's story (do bear with me in first year - it's very difficult to alter that story too much). I am interested in fleshing out background OC's. I am interested - when the story matures to that point - in mature storytelling that tackles difficult subject matter. I am interested in allowing Celeste to grow naturally through her arc (which is centered chiefly around her fear that she will grow to be exactly like her mother). I am interested in enriching canon characters, leaning on their best (or the worst-in-a-good-way in the case of the Death Eaters) aspects. This is not a bashing fic, I assure you.

With that in mind, I am writing the story out of order - and will not publish anything until first year at least is entirely complete. But I have written the first chapter of the story to completion, and I was hoping all of you could read it for me and tell me what you think. Does it interest you? Is it well written? Is it compelling? If the answer to any of these questions is no, please tell me why in a constructive way. This story is my passion project - my long time coming passion project - and I very much want to do it the justice it deserves. Thus far, I have fifty pages of the story (across several time jumps) written, but no one has yet read any of it.

Anyway, I'm sorry for rambling. Thank you for reading both this post and, if you do, the chapter. Without further ado [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uynyapl0gLikqMvQzpIwuHZnMccxad89R2O9kMAphlI/edit?usp=sharing][Chapter 1 of The Ballad of Celeste Lestrange]].


** The first chapter is great, I'd love to read more.

** Please, do write on!

About your questions:

Does it interest you? -Hell, yeah! I'm always interested in Stories like that - but if you also put in a bit of pureblood society (dark is not bad and that stuff) I would be deliriously happy^{^} But it seems like a well thought of approach which I have not read yet. :)

Is it well written? -It seems like it. I'm not a native english speaker, but there weren't any obvious mistakes, like wrong names and similar. You've got your timeline right, time jumps are recognisable and the plot seems (so far in) well thought of.

Is it compelling? Yes! I was stuck right there with Celeste and /really, really/ want to read the next Chapter!
