I've been reading some fanfic preferences and I was confused ... for some the fic with good structure is the one that follows the canon events, for others the good fanfic is completely different from what we know from each book. Is there any balance on which proposal is the most popular / welcome?


** For me it's all about the quality of the fic, not whether or not it follows canon or not. Not just the writing but the pacing, the planning the author has done, their major and interesting plot points. You can have that with canon or non-canon events, though I do think it's harder to make an original and interesting fic that almost completely follows canon events unless you have some other major twist. Especially as you get into later years of Hogwarts. Things happen in a linear fashion. So one change in year one may have a small ripple in year two but by year 7 it should have changed the entire plot. Fics that try to conform to canon in later years after making a lot of changes early on just seem forced and unimaginative.

** As far as what's welcome, people don't really care. There's readers out there who are okay with generally the same events playing out, as if the universe runs on fate and seeks to self correct to stick to the original script.

I get utterly bored of stories that follow the exact events of canon. Especially if they're impossible or implausible.

If Dark!Harry, Remus, and Sirius crucio'd Peter to death during the events of POA, then it's highly unlikely that Voldemort's coming back in year 4 in the exact same way he did in canon.

He only knew about Barty because Peter had a chance meeting with Bertha and they kidnapped and tortured her for information. Then they set off to deliberately free Barty and bring him back to their cause. Convienently, he was at the Quidditch game under an invisibility cloak.

There were A LOT of events that had to go right for this to happen and so it's cheap for Voldemort to turn up with his best pal Barty at his side with no explanation.

I'm not against Voldemort returning, it's just that him reappearing should make sense in the context of the story. If the actions of the main characters don't matter and the same thing happens regardless, then I already know how the story ends.

If your story is going to turn out basically the same way with slightly different dialogue I'll just read something else.

I'd love to see some actual consequences for if your story does something different. A story where Harry drowns Draco in the bathroom in first year and blames it on Marcus Flint should have some major differences later on.

Same deal if you kill off a bunch of major characters or if Harry grew up being raised as a crime lord. If you spent 20,000 words detailing how different your version of Harry was before he came to Hogwarts and then it follows the exact events of canon...well, that's a let down in my opinion.

** It really doesn't matter to me, as long as it's written well. I think authors should change cannon as much as they feel like, so long as the changes make sense. Logical actions and consequences are great to have.

** Im of the belief that you start with the events as closely as you do in canon, but that if a character does something to change the perspective, it becomes a butterfly effect.

Year 2 for instance, when Hargid is sent to prison without a trial, i imagine a butterfly effect would ensue, all inmates would be checked for trial data on and Sirius lack of one will appear. said event snowballs, Sirius becomes free and Peter flees immediatly.

Events that changes like a logical story would, then twist it to your liking. Fudge loosing his position in the backlash for instance, or the triwizard being either cancelled or propped up even more in the coming year to bolster his standing, things like that
