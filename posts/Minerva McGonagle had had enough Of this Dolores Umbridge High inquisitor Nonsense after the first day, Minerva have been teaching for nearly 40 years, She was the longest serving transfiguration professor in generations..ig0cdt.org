** As always, I assume you'll get similar responses to your previous post which was exactly the same here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ewjams/minerva_mcgonagle_had_had_enough_of_this_dolores/]].

May I suggest editing your post with this? I took a few seconds and quickly made a few edits. You found the time to copy your previous post; I'm sure you have the time to edit one.

#+begin_quote
  She had taught every minister, clerk, Auror, and curse breaker to come out of Hogwarts since Scamander had been minister. So Minerva did what any seasoned professor would do when dealing with a misbehaving former pupil. Minerva marched into that little rapscallion Fudge's office, and dragged him out by his ear. She stood there staring over his shoulder while he signed into law a retraction of the high inquisitor laws, putting a kibosh on ministry interference at Hogwarts. At least by Fudge's administration.

  Minerva left a terrified minister in her wake but not before tapping her wand on his desk, transforming a paperweight into a cat, as a not so subtle stone reminder that she had her eye on him.

*** Dude it's a prompt. I am the OP from the original post so I decided to repost the prompt. It's a little bit different than what I usually see on here so I figured it would give some people some new ideas for writing even if it had been posted before simply put I thought it might spark a change in perspective or give someone an idea we don't have a lot of stories focusing on mcgonagall within the fandom.

Plus I figured it might make people laugh and Lord knows we all could use more laughter with all the crazy crab going on this year.

**** "New Ideas"

Dude you just reposted an old prompt that you made yourself

At least invent something /new/ if you're gonna say you do it to inject /new/ ideas into the sub.

**** That's totally fine. There's nothing inherently wrong with a repost. But if you're going to repost from 6 months ago, seemingly for karma or attention (remember when you reposted four times in 24 hours and called it an accidental deletion? - [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/i7zsd7/when_it_came_to_group_entertainment_each_house/]]), take the time to edit the title and post.

Edit: Upon review, it may have been three instead of four times. My point stands though.

****** Just make the absolute minimum of effort to fix glaring mistakes like "McGonagle". I mean seriously.

Also, a prompt is supposed to be a themesetter, not a plot description.

Additionally, it would come across as less shady if you linked to the previous repost.

****** It's a pretty poor one, you've told the whole story and not left the writers invited to work with it much room to do their own narrative.

****** And again, it's common courtesy to edit for basic grammar. No one expects perfect grammar, I know I make mistakes in my posts all the time, but at least edit your post quickly. I've even started providing edits for you. If you can copy a post from 6 months ago, you can copy a comment.
