The Darkness Within is my favorite fanfic, and I'm looking for something similar!

​

-James and Lily alive, I don't care if it's about WBWL, etc. I just want something where they will rebuild their relationship little by little, that kind of story captivates me a lot!

​

(Note: I've read Light Up The Sky)

​

Thank you guys!


** Could you link the stories please
