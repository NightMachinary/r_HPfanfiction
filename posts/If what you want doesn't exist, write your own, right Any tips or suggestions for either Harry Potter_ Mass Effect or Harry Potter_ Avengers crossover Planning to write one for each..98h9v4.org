** A possible Avengers Idea how about,- Harry being a 21-29 year old Auror, he's has basically become the Harry that everyone usually treats him ass during the Voldemort War. He's badass a leader spells and tricks out the wazoo. He's already done a stint with the ICW as a International Auror and is on track to be a Auror captain and eventually head of the DMLE. but one day Harry best called into Kingsley's office and joins Kingsley In a meeting with important people on both sides of the divide mostly military personnel. Harry is asked to join a program and become a agent of MI6 to act as a guard against supernatural threats that have been targeting Muggles recently, Vampires, Werewolves, Demons and Giant Monsters ect. And to assist in his efforts he is to become Britain's very own Super Soldier 'Union Jack' empowered by rituals and powerful rare potions Harry takes on insane odds.- this gives you a direct plug into both the untapped parts of the Marvel Universe since no one uses the Horror comics as a bridge between the two universes, and the normal things, I mean the US could contact their British friends in hopes of using their Monster Slayer to slay a monster in the US, or maybe Shield being employed by the UN and the World Security Council pushes To induct the British Monster Hunter into the Avengers

On the one you have, it's interesting but it feels like all the Kid Harry gets raised by XYZ stories that are around alot, I mean how many plots can a highly limited 13 year old get intangled with? In combat he has literally nothing, he can make some smoke and some small fireworks like explosions and that's it, maybe the bind spells and flipendo at the most. Even walking X Men joke Jubilee and her 'Fireworks' still can make those fireworks blow through a solid steel door.

It could be more interesting if he gets banished to the Marvel Universe by Voldemort while Harry is all tied up in the Graveyard, Voldemort unwillingly to try and fight Harry knowing it has never gone well for him uses a spell to spin him off into a parallel world, at 14-15 and after the Triwizard Harry can be treated both as a kid who is in over his head and as a threat if you give him some more impressive violent spells and assigning his knowledge of them to his training for the TWT.

General Avengers thoughts, use the Comics, and ideas from them especially for Harry's adventures. The worst thing you can do is make him into the MCU's Rick Jones. Who's Rick Jones? Well he's most notably the Guy that Bruce Banner saves from the Gamma Bomb that created the Hulk in the Comics, Rick then goes on to be the uninteresting generic side kick of the Hulk and then eventually the Avengers that Young readers were supposed to identify with, he often has to be saved was called Bucky by Captain America while Bucky was still officially dead but did no badass Bucky things and all around was boring as fuck. Don't be afraid to send Harry off on his own adventures while other characters are having their own adventures, imagine how lame you would see The Hulk if during the Fight with Blonski Iron Man shows up to save him, that would make you never be impressed with the Hulk and thus see him as a weakling. The same applies to Harry if we never see him succeed by himself against major threats. But how can he find a major threat and take it out if there all accounted for and beaten by the main players? Make some of your own or harvest them from the source material. Tony is dealing Ivan Vanko, well Harry is off investigating a Cult of people obsessed with the Snake God Set, and has to stop them before they break open a gateway and allow him Dominion on Earth, or Captain America is dealing with the Winter Solider, then Harry has gone to South America where he can feel powerful Magic being preformed only to see a Giant Monster burst forth and Harry has to kill it before it reaches a city and kills people. How about Thor is dealing with the Dark Elves and Harry afterwards has to deal with something the Dark Elves released, the Executioners Axe, which like super Horcux takes over the holders body and mind replacing it with the Executioner's which is a being on par with Thor himself and Harry takes it upon himself to stop the monster separate the innocent person from the power of the Axe and destroy it without falling Prey to it himself. All three Scenarios I've offered there all involve ideas from the Comics, all make Harry out to be a hard ass on par with the other Avengers and all allow for Harry to Grow up without being a Tag along kid or a useless burden. Hell all three could and do relate to the 3 main Avengers, Serpent Society is tied to Cap, the Giant Monster was gonna be Fin Fang Foom the Giant Dragon is tied to Iron Man and The Executioner and his Axe are tied to Thor. These Adventures away from everyone else would make your Harry his own character not only on the Marvel Universe but also in the Harry Verse, he wouldn't just be Bland Ole Harry, he's a interesting badass who won his own fights. Plus you could give him his own Love interest without scrapping around for people his age for him to date

*** It sounds like you have stories that you want to write, which is pretty cool. Personally, those types of stories are that one I don't have much interest in anymore. The Avengers/ Harry Potter crossover archive has enough stories where Harry is super power/ super veteran/ etc.

As far as Harry's spellset goes, he has more options than you would think!

Below are the different spells Harry would have learned from his first two years at Hogwarts (there are some repeats; at least one spell is taught across all three books).

The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 1

- Wand-Lighting Charm

- Softening Charm

- Severing Charm

- Fire-Making Spell

- Unlocking Charm

*Levitation Charm

- Locking Spell

- Mending Charm

The Dark Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection

*Curse of the Bogies

*Green Sparks

*Red Sparks

*Knockback Jinx

*Smokescreen Spell

*Wand-Lighting Charm

*Wand-Extinguishing Charm

The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2

*Wand-Lighting Charm

*Severing Charm

*Disarming Charm

*Skurge Charm

*Avifors

*Dancing Feet Spell

*Engorgement Charm

*Fire-Making Charm

*Freezing Charm

*General Counter-Spell

*Memory Charm

*Tickling Charm

*Unlocking Charm

*Arresto Momentum

Now, not all the spells are relevant or would see any use in day-to-day life or combat. But I would say that Avifors could very well be his ace spell, as it turns the target into a bird--or flock of birds. Personally, I think a wizard's home is not on the battlefield, but developing and applying utility spells that could help logistics and stuff.

Edit: Sorry bout the formatting. I can't fix it...

** Interesting idea for the Avengers crossover. I would like to see a Harry limited to only first or second year spells, actually. As for some actual tips... I suppose that would be don't include X-Men unless you're willing to get your brains fucked by some seriously messed up timelines. I'm writing an Avengers crossover myself and I personally do not want to touch the X-Men universe with a ten-foot pole. Another thing would probably be to work out a timeline for the canon events of MCU, especially if you're starting early on like during the Incredible Hulk movie or something. It'll help work out where your plot fits in and how to pace your story so that it complements the MCU universe. There's a pretty detailed timeline available on the MCU wiki page, but you'll have to sift through a lot of the TV series stuff too.

Can't really comment much on Mass Effect as I don't really play the game - I only heard about it through fanfiction actually.

The reason is simple: another wears her face and claims her life. Jessamine Potter, Mistress of Death, arrives at the dawn of a new world of superheroes and gods. Fem, Amoral, OP, MoD Harry.

** Mass effect, keep magic and biotics separate. They are different, have different rules and uses. You risk offending both fans by smashing them together and compromising both. Biotics are very, very limited compared to magic, there is absolutely no reason that wizards would have given up the greater flexibility of magic for biotics. There is no way for them to be the same without damaging what has been built. You risk losing any immersion if you start out with things that don't make sense.

Mass Effect was great. The games were fun, but we all know about the ending. The Reapers were too strong, it made sense for them to be but it also meant that a deus ex machina was needed to beat them. The reapers have to be strong else they would have been stopped before. The first two games are about building unity in the galaxy only for you to realise that it doesn't matter, the Reapers are too strong. Think carefully about if you'd be better off focusing on the first conflict war. Beating the Reapers should be almost impossible, is the way we see the only way? If you can't think of another way then you risk being slaved to canon. What is the point of adding magic to the Mass Effect universe if it changes nothing?

Tom Riddle being behind Cerberus is an interesting idea. His diary potentially trying to indoctrinate the Reapers. Are Cerberus that different to the Death Eaters? Would Voldemort rise above muggles vs wizards if it became humans vs aliens? Or would he just be fighting for magic still?

** Mass Effect crossovers where FemShep is thrown through time and space together with Liara and Tali and they end up at Privet Drive roughly two hours after Dumbledore dumped Harry there. While looking around, Jane finds a baby on the doormat and brings it back for hypothermia treatment while Tali is working her own branch of magic and repairing the shuttle/spacecraft. They end up adopting Harry ( technically kidnapping) and create a company which introduces all kinds of future technology, making Jane an better version of Elon Musk. And no one has qualms about messing up the timeline since they were getting bend over by the Reapers and needed the extra edge.

They set up a hidden base at the Prothean archives and are surprised when an owl shows up there a decade later, bringing Harry's Hogwarts letter. He ends up telling everyone that he was raised by two aliens on Mars and all magical children are like "sounds like something Harry Potter would do".

** I'd love to see a young Harry being taken in by Dr. Strange and learning Kamar-Taj style magic with a sling ring- Perhaps he has to be convinced by the Avengers to do so.

One possibility, he needs instruction after he starts to lose control of his magic due to the stress of finding himself in a new dimension, and there's nobody else who can teach him.

  A slightly different encounter with Quirrell at the end of first year leads to new problems, new abilities, and a gateway to the extraordinary. A HP/Avengers crossover that respects the timelines while throwing in new twists and characters you may not have seen coming. Now in Year 3. Enjoy!

** With Mass Effect, if you can try to avoid the "Stations of Canon" of the ME universe. 90% of the crossovers I've seen just follow the events from the game religiously, which is frustrating. If you wish to /undermine/ the original storyline, then by all means pretend to go that way at first, but the universe is really wide and it makes a lot of the stories feel the same just sticking to those few things.

The horcrux idea is cool. What happened to Voldemort Prime? Would he still be a wraith somewhere? Or maybe he decided to take a quieter route to power and is now the Shadow Broker? Would the Prime and the Horcrux be allies or enemies? Does being trapped in an object have a negative effect on the soul, or are they in stasis for all that time?

Avengers is a lot wider since there are so many character plot paths you can follow, so less of them feel "the same". I'm not sure I've seen 11yr old dimension travel to Marvel before, so it'd be cool to see it done!

*** Yeah, that's something that frustrates me, as well, about a lot of the ME fanfiction. I really, really hate it when the "new character" (canon character from different series, SI, OC, whatever) just steals or uses someone's lines, too.

I have some ideas of what Voldemort accomplished from still having a horcrux to keep himself alive. However, I'm still torn between what to pick. Like, he could be a Shadow Broker, or he could be a monarch on a planet hidden by magic. Or he could be waging wars again other magical races. There's a lot of options.

I think a lot of Avenger stories is about what kind of story is unfolding in addition to the Avengers movie, which is can sometimes be neat. But writers do it too often, I sometimes feel. But there's quite a few enjoyable crossovers, although my favorite is still "Ink Stains". If you haven't read it, I suggest reading it! I linked someone else to the story in this same thread.

One good thing to consider if you're about to write an Avengers crossover, is that you can cherrypick from the Marvel Universe in general. If it comes down to it, you can always designate it Earth-62442 or whatever later. Actually, Earth-62442 might be an excellent designation for Harry's /home/ universe...

****** Oh! The different Marvel "Universes" (e.g. the MCU, Earth-616 where all the main stuff happens, the Ultimates Universe) all have a "designation" of Earth followed by a number. 62442 spells out magic on alphanumeric keypads, which is why it's the passcode for the Ministry's phone booth guest entrance. If you branch out far enough in scope to need a designation, I thought it'd be a cool one to use. Sorry for any confusion I might have caused!
