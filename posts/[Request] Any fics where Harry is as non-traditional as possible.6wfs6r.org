There's plenty of fics out there that have Harry becoming a massive traditionalist, trying his best to be as pureblood as possible, but are there any extreme non-traditional fics? I haven't read any, so I was wondering if anyone knew of any.


** The [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/51538][Harveste Addams]] series by Kyaru, in which Harry is raised by the Addams family. He's traditionally non-traditional, in that it's traditional for an Addams to not be traditional. He follows blood magic traditions, but not dark magic or pureblood traditions. Excellent series with a story for each book, unfortunately abandoned at the beginning of the 6th book, but worth a read anyway.

** Well I suppose being literally raised by aliens would be non-traditional as possible.

  Harry Potter has just received his Hogwarts letter, but really doesn't want to go. After all, who would want to live on a planet? Especially one where the natives think nuclear energy is high science. And let's not forget the 42,000 lightyear commute.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.
