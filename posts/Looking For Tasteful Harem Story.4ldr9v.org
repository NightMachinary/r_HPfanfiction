**** Not really. It might have the bare bones of a decent story, but those bones would be the skeleton of a 800 pound man. The author doesn't know how to shut the fuck up about anything, and uses the most flowery language he possibly can. Also, Fleur's father is infuriating. IIRC he acts like he's known Harry his whole life, knows what's best for him, and is practically his father. His name is also annoying. It gets old really fucking quick.

It's probably the best one I've read. It's pretty smut heavy though if that's not what you're looking for. The characters are all pretty believable and all have different reasons for being there, they're definitely more than just names. It's is unfinished though and might be abandoned.

** The Firebird Trilogy. It's creative, original, the characters are well-written, the plot is complex, and the harem is believable.

However, it's is extremely dark and gritty, with multiple horrific deaths and incidents. It's a tribute to the author's writing that this warning is necessary but nevertheless be warned it doesn't have a fairy tale ending.

**** Basically, the wizarding world is extremely female-dominated. Male birthrate is extremely low and so by law males are required to take multiple wives (normally 2). However, taking a wife (bonding) decreases the magical power of the male and the bond is permanent; thus politics is dominated by women, who control their husbands like puppets.

Also, there are four types of magic inside a person, like the Greek elemental types; thus four houses at Hogwarts. Harry is a rare fifth type that can interact/manipulate with the four.

The world, obviously, is highly AU. It gives a lot of characters different motivations. Also, some characters are female instead of male due to the birthrate. This can put off readers who despise OOC characters.

Luna doesn't make a major appearance until book 2. She is an Aether, like Harry.

I admire it for its creativity and new world, despite how dark it gets (Voldemort isn't the only villain, just the most evil one).

*** /Firebird/ has good wordbuilding and its writing is technically not bad, but I wouldn't recommend it as “tasteful harem story”. In fact, on the Luna-punishes-Hermione scene alone I would specifically recommend to stay away from it, if what OP's looking for is tasteful polygamy \ polyamory.

  Another scene in the same story was when Luna, as the “1st wive”, invoked a kinda-ritualistic punishment on Hermione for sleeping with Harry out of her turn. I know that it hardly compares to the first one, but it was just so OoC for Luna's character that came as completely out of blue for me.
#+end_quote

The story was all about how the protags were trying to break the barbaric status quo, and then Luna gets /really/ pissed off and causes much distress to Hermione just because H. unintentionally (IIRC) screwed up the schedule and spent a night with Harry out of turn. Nobody thought Luna was overreacting or being unfair either --- it felt like a scene from some cult community, except you were supposed to root for the cultists.

That said, I don't know what happens in it exactly because I only skimmed through certain parts as I have enough experience with romantic weirdness that most romantic stories in general (not only the harem ones, but those too) make me just give up and stop reading because they're as if the authors had no experience with romance at all (which probably is the case with most of them), but this particular author has a tendency to justify weird stuff tradition or other such excuses. It doesn't necessarily mean it's all bad, but yeah, sometimes there are those “rooting for the cult” vibes.
