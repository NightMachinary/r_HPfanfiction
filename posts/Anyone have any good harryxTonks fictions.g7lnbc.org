It was the best of honks it was the worst of honks.

Or any great Susan bones fan fictions but those are far and in between that I haven't read


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11995519/1/Harry-Potter-Air-Elemental][Harry-Potter-Air-Elemental]] HarryXSusan with a strong mc who finds out his secret power that was mentioned in the prophecy. The way Voldy and his pack of baboons dies is also pretty neat.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12886674/1/The-Green-in-the-Grey][The-Green-in-the-Grey]] HarryXTonks. I haven't read it yet, but the author usually provides top-quality stories! :)
