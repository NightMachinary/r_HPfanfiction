I remember that in first chapter Umbridge confronts Harry who is very calm and seems to have a command on all the students.


** First, your flair is wrong. You should be using /What's that fic/

  They expected him to be a paragon of virtue, a champion of the Light, the personification of all that is good and noble in their world...they were wrong. Explore the legend of a darker Harry Potter, seen from the eyes of friend and foe alike. Multiple POVs. Non-linear narrative. Rated M for violence.
