i've read some fic where harry is overpowered and instead of fighting the Dark Lord he kind of... enslaves him? traps him? keeps him tame? keeps him prisoner? various types of endgames.

i've been enjoying the fics of this type i found on ao3, so i'm mostly looking for recs on Livejournal or FFN because those sites are harder to search on.

It's cool if its sexual or non-sexual. It's cool if its voldemort or tom riddle. thanks for the recs!
