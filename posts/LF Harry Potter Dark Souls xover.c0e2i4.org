** The Soulsborne lore takes a bit too much work to learn than most of the people writing fan fiction are willing to put in. So unless you write your own, no.

I've been writing an HP/Bloodborne crossover for a while now, and it's hard work. I have pictures and notes on all the little in game lore snippets, watched just about every video on YT on the subject, and I have a few Google Docs that are novels unto themselves.

** Most of the time any kind of crossover like this or the Witcher series, Harry ends up being one of them, rather than someone like Dumbledore. I mean, can you imagine the Witcher trying to take on Dumbledore? A swish and a flick and Geralt ends up hogtied and hanging on top of a tree.
