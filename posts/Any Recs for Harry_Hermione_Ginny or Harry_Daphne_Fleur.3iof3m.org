** H/Hr/DG that is long. My only complaint is that i feel it could have had a more difficult plot and more realistic reactions to a 14 year old. I get that he time travelled but to everyone else, they are 14. But i love Daphne and Hermione so I couldn't say no to a story with both of them haha Linkffn(Harry Potter- Three to Backstep)

*** I really dislike this fic. I mean, I would actively dislike these people in real life, and judging from the reviews, I wouldn't be the only one. I totally agree about them apparently forgetting that to others, they're just fourteen year old students, not sixty year old political mavens. Good technical writing, but inconsistent characterization, bizarre monologues, and too many tropes (one or two is more than enough) made this a DNF for me.

**** That was my biggest issue. I was excited for both Her,ione and Daphne as they do bring different experiences to the table but i felt like every issue was handled too easily and come on, how do you get to verbally spank literally everyone when you are just fourteen? I feel like it could have been executed much better. But it is long, technically well written, and includes two of the women that the poster wanted.

**** You can definitely tell the author writes Jane Austen fiction for a living. The prose is really tedious. It could be cut in half by rewording the sentences alone. That said, I like the plot ideas the author has, and I have managed to slog through it a time or two.

***** Yes, the story is more wordy than most fanfics. However, the vast majority of fanfics develop relationships unrealistically fast within a couple of chapters. This story is imho, the most believable development of a threesome in the HP fandom.

**** Yep. Unfortunately, this is the case almost exclusively with really long stories in fanfiction, because with that length, you either need to procrastinate with the plot and focus on details, or use a large number of plot points. And really, not many writers are able to dish out that many plot points without the majority of them sucking or being tedious.

Actually, having checked out a large number of stories, I think that only one(!) long one (500k +) was /great/ and not either repetitive or plainly dull.
