I re-read /Conditionally/ recently, and it's got me craving fics where Sirius disowns or cuts Harry out of his life for whatever reason (they don't have to be Severitus fics).


** The Substitute linkffn(4641394)

Only one I can think of. Sirius and Remus both.

**** It's unlikely you'll find an upbeat fic that fits your request.

***** I know that, but I don't like fics with the main character dying in the end.

There's a big difference between upbeat and that.

  The magical contract made by the Goblet of Fire inadvertently sets underway events that change everything you thought you knew about the boy-who-lived. AU GOF, depressing and a bit dark.

  Ten years of life at the Dursleys have healed Alexandra Potter of any good feelings she might have towards her aunt, uncle and cousin, leaving her friendless and sarcastic about life. On her eleventh birthday, a letter sent by a school of magic may give her a providential escape. Except, of course, things may not be that simple for a girl fan of the Lord of the Rings...
