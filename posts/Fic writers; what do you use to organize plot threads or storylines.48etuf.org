Trying to tackle my fic that's collecting dust and realizing I need something better then pen and paper for documenting the twists and turns. What kind of programs, online editors, or software do you guys use or have you tried out? Looking for something free and user friendly.


** I use two methods to keep track of my shifting POV story.

My plot arcs are organised by POV in a Word doc by bullet points outlining the broad strokes as each. A (generic) example:

- *Harry*

- Leaves Privet Dr

- Boards HE at KCS

- Etc

This method isn't great for keeping track of things chronologically, so I use Excel for that. Here's a highly redacted [[http://imgur.com/7ucjpzs][image]] showing how that works. It also lets me keep track of where I've left off editing, which goes a long way toward saving my sanity.

Great topic. I look forward to seeing what other methods people use to stay organised.

** Well, I just use word. I have two documents about the fic I'm working on right now. The first is "notes" where I keep the basic summary, important twists and turns, explanations for things happening that are intentionally vague, etc. The second is "outline" where I've outlined the name of each chapter and the basic events that take place. Once I've finished the outline and notes, I'll actually write the story on a third word document. I don't know if this is the best way to do it, but it's how I always have.

*** This is how I've been doing it as well. But sometimes I want to rearrange scenes or plot out multiple storylines on one thread to make sure everything matches up, and I'm finding Word inadequate for that kind of thing.

**** Dramatica (there is a free trial version you can have a play with to see if it will suit you, but is frustrating as you cannot save anything) is a tool which essentially helps you develop and outline by asking you a series of questions (You can set it at 3 different depth levels of questioning, with the highest being several hundred questions long.)

As you answer the various questions (Or leave them, it will allow you to come back when you have a clearer idea) regarding the synopsis, your characters, their relationships and motives it assists you by telling you what archetypal model your story is drawn from or most resembles. So you can decide to subvert that archetype or use it to ensure your story hits all the beats to be fulfilling to the reader.

Periodically it generates reports with all the information you have given it regarding character and plot so you can see how it all fits together.

Its a great place to start if you have only a vague idea or plot bunny as the questioning will challenge you and get you to examine your idea and what your true premise is. I find it particularly useful for outlining. It can be daunting and a little overwhelming at first, but ultimately I find it useful for more complex and nuanced pieces where their are a lot of moving parts. I'd say have a good play around (allow yourself a few hours) with the free trial. I know there is a version of Dramatica Pro (the full version) available as a torrent ... (Umm pirate bay I think) is the $70 odd price tag is a deal breaker.

The Robert Marshall Plan for novel writing began as a book, which has been a staple for many years. There are a lot of free versions of the book around which will convey Marshall's ideas.

I use it to shape an outline into a draft by making it run practically and logically and see where there are gaps in the narrative.

It uses a series of tried and true formulas for writing to keep you on track. Some people find it too prescriptive and think it stifles you. (It will do things like tell you if the model it thinks you story is most like would have X scene or Y scene written from a different character POV for example). I quite like the nudges, I find them useful to keep moving forward and know I don't have to take its advice.

It is a lot more pricey about $120 US and I haven't found a free version of the software anywhere so it might be one for down the track unless you are looking to make an investment - but even so, I'd suggest reading the book first.

** I use a combination of Google Sheets and Evernote for organizing.

In Sheets, the rows have the scenes and twists I need organized chronologically. I use columns for chapter, description of the scene, approximate date of event, and POV. If there's subplots, I add one column to identify if the scenes are part of the main plot, romance, etc. (This makes it easier to filter it if I just want to see how just one plot is going.) A final column is labeled links, which is where Evernote comes in.

I organize the scenes in Evernote. They're often written in Notepad, but I get confused when I got a whole bunch of scenes and parts of scenes in one document. So I cut and paste scenes into Evernote. I can create a note and name it something like "Harry finds Sirius" and another "Ginny talks to Arthur." They're separate. I can tag them based on character POV and nest those under the .scene tag. Backstory and explanations get nested under another tag. I know what's happening chronologically and what scenes I still need to write by copying the link of the note into the column in Sheets.

It's awesome being able to access Sheets and Evernote from everywhere too. I tried carrying around pen and paper for if I'm waiting somewhere, but I prefer just adding notes to my phone.

** I use Scrivener a lot. I have different documents, one for the text itself, one for character development and one for plot lines.

Most of it is in my head, though. I only use those extra documents for snippets and sudden ideas I need to write down. I have a certain idea of what I want to achieve with a certain scene, and then I write it down and see where it takes me.

** I sorta don't. I'm a very go-with-the-flow kind of writer and run around haphazardly writing things that come to mind. I have a bunch of unfinished stories across multiple fandoms (only one I have up on ffnet now is a ASOIAF one) where often, I'll write a prologue, then a chapter midway through, then somewhere way later, then fill in the blanks, hopping around a lot.

Sometimes I have to backtrack when I stray too far - one of my OC fics went pure Mary Sue self-insert - but generally that's me.

That said, Google Drive could be good. And Scrivener, which I used once then forgot about because of my writing style.

** It depends on how your narration is organized. For a fix where the narration is as messy as...let's say...Pulp fiction, good old excel is a must, because you need to keep track os the chronological order of events (this is from personal experience). For something more linear, you don't need anything overly complex, a simple writing software should do the trick. Then again, excel might be useful to keep track of the progress in the sub-plots.
