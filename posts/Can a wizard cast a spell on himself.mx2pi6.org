Like, cast a Mobilicorpus and fly.


** Yes? There are spells, like the disillusionment spell that they use on themselves. I imagine the levicorpus wouldn't allow you to fly though. Isn't is designed as a prank spell?

** There are a few canon examples.

Dumbledore disillusions himself to surprise Harry in the Mirror of Erised room (it's not explicit but Dumbledore pretty much spells it out, no pun intended).

In the films, Harry casts Ascendio when he's about to drown in the second challenge... although we might want to ignore that one.

The spell to extract a memory for use in a Pensieve is seen cast on oneself a few times.

Then depending on how pedantic we're going to be here, you could say the summoning charm is cast on oneself too - you can't summon to someone else after all. It's obviously cast on the object concerned, but there's an unspoken secondary part.

We don't know what spell Voldemort and Snape use to fly but that seems to be cast on oneself too.

** Yes, there are tons of examples in canon of this.

Self Transfiguration

Bubblehead Charm

Disillusionment

Cosmetic Charms

Drying Charm

Warming Charm

Healing Charm

Memory Charms

Sonorus Charm

These are just the ones off the top of my head.

** Some spells seem to while others don't. You have plenty of examples of spells that are used to cast on oneself. However in the extended canon (up to you if you consider it as canon or not), Wingardium Leviosa only works on clothes but not on the person so you risk remaining naked if you use it. Also I doubt that the Summoning spell works since you're already there.

** I think it depends on the spell. Some are intended to be used that way, but some maybe not. For example Mobilicorpus is used to levitate someone else, there's a good chance it doesn't work properly when used on yourself. Like you can pick things up by grabbing them, but you can't pull yourself up by grabbing yourself.

** There is no canon answer for sure. In fanon though there are spells that affect animate and spells that affect inanimate. For example you can wingardium a book but not a person. You can disillusion a person but not an object.

*** The disillusion spells work on objects in canon otherwise the floating clothes/glasses/wands would be a dead giveaway.

**** The question is if a SPECIFIC spell can be used. There are variations that have the desired effect but you can't use the same spell on a person and on an object.
