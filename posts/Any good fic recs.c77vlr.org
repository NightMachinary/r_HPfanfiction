I like the next gen, but anything is fine. I prefer angst over fluff, and I'm not a big shipper, so as long as it's done well, I won't judge by ship, but I love post-Cursed Child and/or pining Scorbus. Preferably complete. No noncon or explicit sex scenes.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

** Linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution)

Post-DH but not epilogue compliant, the death eaters bribed themselves free again and try to regain power through the most idiotic concept of all of fanfiction: Passing a marriage law. The general population isn't amused and then Hermione gets the idea to re-enact the french revolution.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

** Linkffn(Democracy by Starfox5)

The war is won. Neville goes into politics. Hermione does, too. But unfortunately the muggleborn witch and the pureblood wizard have very different political opinions.

  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.

** I probably rec this too often, but I love linkao3(Fate is a Four Letter Word). It is post-epilogue and has a good amount of the next-gen characters, although it isn't Albus/Scorpius and focuses on Harry. A lot of people write it off because of the ship Harry/Kingsley/Snape but honestly, you can skip the romance part and it's still a good read.

Edit: I just re-read your request and now I'm worried that there are explicit sex scenes in Fate, but I can't remember! If you are already on the fence due to length, maybe give it a pass.

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?
