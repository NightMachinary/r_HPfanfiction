There are quite a few fanfictions out there where Harry undergoes the Animagus transformation, and quite a few of them have magical creatures - but they're always the same ones, like a pheonix, magical wolf/dog, large dragon. What i want to see is something less impressive and maybe more amusing, i remember reading a Hp/pokemon crossover where his form was mew, but i rather cracked up at an idea i had for him to find he has a dragon animagus, be really excited for it, and to end up as Toothless from 'how to train your dragon' with the playful personality as part of its instincts. Any thoughts or Reccomendations?


** By the 'Mew' one, you're talking about Harry Mewter, right?

I wonder if anyone has done a Diricawl animagus (aka dodo animagus)?

That'd be funny, having a Harry who just goes ~poof~ whenever danger comes along.

Broom trying to buck him off during his first Quidditch match? ~poof~

Basilisk slithering through the halls to try and find him? ~poof~

Tied to a gravestone in Little Hangleton? ~poof~

(...And just to be clear, Diricawls, aka dodos, in Harry Potter, have an ability to teleport away from danger, a technique that led Muggles to believe they went extinct. I'm not talking about a furry Harry who fluffs up his fur whenever something threatens him, though that would also be funny.)

*** HA! That would be amazing, although very problematic if he could not control it, like he's trying to protect his friends in the DoM battle but keeps 'poofing' away whenever he's threatend, and yes the story i referenced was Harry Mewter.

** I can't recommend it as a story (unless you're in the mood for a manipulative!Dumbledore Weasley-bashing parody), but linkffn(harry potter and the manipulator of destiny) gives him the form of a robin. An adorable, fluffy, English robin. And he's humiliated. And barely ever changes, even though that would actually be pretty useful. Oh, and the portraits of Sirius and his parents all crack up when they find out.

  Post OotP. Harry finds that Dumbledore has been less than honest or helpful with him, takes control of his own life and finds the training he needs from others. HHr, NL, no slash. COMPLETE
