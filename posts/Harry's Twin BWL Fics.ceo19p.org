Why is it that whenever I read a fic where Harry Potter has a twin and said twin is the BWL, they always have the most ridiculous scars? Like a V shaped scar, a Z shaped scar, etc. I want to say that I read a fic where someone said that the V for Harry's twin's scar meant Voldemort but I'm sincerely hoping I'm wrong. What I'm wondering is why not use another, different rune instead of a letter?


** Just here to confirm that you did, in fact, read a fic with a V for Voldemort scar. There's also a heart-shaped one symbolizing someone's sacrifice and love.

(I can remember neither story)

*** I think there is a V scar in Harry Potter and the prince of slytherin.

***** It's probably 'sowilo', which -- at least -- is a real rune (sun and such stuff (compare to ON sol, OE sigel)

** I remember a couple, one where the v was actually from falling debris and another where it was carved by Bellatrix (but I think that one was Neville).
