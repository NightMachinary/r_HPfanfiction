Well, since there can be only one sticky, I suppose this will just have to do. Once it goes to page 2 (it'll be a while, since this sub is rather quiet), I'll make a part 2 thread and link to this one.

OT: I have just finished reading part 1, and here's my opinion:

The Good: The fleshed out universe, characterization, and the Evangelion-ish vibe to the post Voldemort world. I really like the government hierarchy between wizard and witch, and the goal change for Voldemort. I actually like this Voldemort, since he's a genuine villian/anti-hero instead of an image villain that's just there for Harry to defeat in book 7 to end the series. Umbridge once again, managed to retain the same feel she has in the original series, in this universe.

The Bad: How the PoA arc resolved. There was no background information on Sirius, and the ending just felt abrupt. The gist of it ended up being Sirius hate Lily for not having pity sex with him and breaking up the Marauder.

EDIT: Regarding the whole darker and edgier back story:

I felt that was part of the fic's appeal. It's a deconstruction of the Rowling's HP world, and its characters. At the end of the day, HP is fairly wishy washy and its meant to reach out to its readers. Voldemort is a fairly generic villain at the end of the day. Umbridge was the better created villain, because she's real. She represent the government's oppression, and while she's evil, she's evil in a completely plausible way. Voldemort and the Death Eaters just felt like mooks for Harry and co to defeat until Harry finally kill the big boss. And this fic delivers. A civilization that stopped developing in the 17-18th century comes with its own set of prejudice and rules. And there is no real "good guys". There are different political faction, they may show a certain allegiance, but at the end of the day its all down to their own self interest. The Sabbats represent the archaic system. The death eaters represent the violent revolution (they don't want equality, they want to reverse the power balance). And we have the protagonist smack bang in the middle, stuck between a power struggle. As someone who enjoyed works such as:

- Neon Genesis Evangelion

- Berserk

- The smiling, proud wanderer (A Wuxia novel btw, for those who don't know)

Firebird Trilogy felt very familiar thematic wise. If you don't like this particular fanfiction due to the excessive violence, I'd suggest checking out any of the above work.


** The setting is a unique one that is properly fleshed out, but I absolutely hate what he is doing to the canon characters. Everyone who is not in Harry's direct circle is so absolutely evil they make canon Voldemort look like a boyscout.

He also delights in letting the bad guys win time and time again, and each time the good side has a victory it is at the cost of someone's death, or rape, or worse.

The Muggles are experimenting on witches and literally torturing them to death. The Sabbats are so outright evil they have enslaved all men and are selling women who cause trouble to the Goblins as sex slaves. Voldemort is the anti-Sabbat, he murders any bonded women without giving a damn. And Harry and his harem are in the middle, getting kicked in the head by everyone.

I stopped reading it a while back since the story is so absolutely dark I don't care anymore to read it. I cannot see it ending in anything other than either the death of our protagonists, or the complete destruction of the world.

#+end_quote

Deconstruction implies taking source material and filling out "skipped" details to point out inconsistencies that make the original story fall apart. Perhaps evolving from there.

The term doesn't apply here because Firebird's magic world is built on an entirely different premise than Rowling's setting - different rules of magic, entirely different society, entirely different characters.

** Read all of parts 1 and 2.

So I like the world building and how the author has addressed the balance of powers in the story (characters are stronger than in the original, but also have more drawbacks and enemies), but I just can't bring myself to enjoy for a bunch of reasons:

- *The Premise* To me, the whole story feels like a bad writing prompt for a contest or something. In the fewest words, the plot can be summarized as "men's rights horror story crossed with harry potter harem fiction". Oh, men are leagues more powerful, but the eeeevil women are always keeping them down with the very act of sex (or just eye contact for that matter) weakening them. Even just the sight of a naked woman renders them catatonic. Also, adults raping young boys is perfectly okay, if not encouraged, in this society. Harry, of course, is immune to all of this, but for everyone else it feels like a ridiculous caricature of a matriarchal society. Also, 14 year old orgies and lots of sex talk.

- *The Characters* A lot of the supporting characters in part 2 go through some pretty wild personality swings. Luna goes from scared, wide-eyed child to "I am first wife and I have the right to kill [my friend and sex-partner] if I choose to." and back over the course of about 3 days. Everyone in the Order agrees with her, of course, even though they are all working together to try and dismantle the society that supports that kind of behavior (and said as much not hours before the incident).

- *The EEEEEEEEvilness* Like others have already said, half the plot is rape/murder. And it seems like the only reason they do that is because they want to maintain their dictatorrape society. There's a country-sized example of how to maintain their population despite the genetic issues (which wouldn't require them to lose the matriarchy-dominated government) assuming they don't just ban men from politics/spellcasting altogether, but neither of those options are rapey enough.

- *The Plotting* When the government isn't trying to rape, murder, or rape-murder harry and friends they act pretty stupidly. Not to give away too much for people that aren't caught up, they essentially recognize that harry and the gang are active dissidents and a threat to their society but don't really do much to directly stop them. They just interrogate them occasionally and task someone with watching their door (without magic of course, because that's cheating). Despite years of political maneuvering they even fall for the jenius-level deception of: "We'll agree to marry a girl from X family, but not specify which. That way we can pick girl #2 (who we like) even though they want us to pick girl #1 (who is a government-sanctioned assassin)."

So, yeah. I want to like it, but morbid curiosity is pretty much the only thing that keeps me going at this point.

*** Yeah I always hoped that they would be stuck with Daphne cause lets face it, noone falls for the "oh we've conveniently not specified that he's fo deffs taking the daughter you want him too"

Would also be nice to have a middle ground somewhere of countries that are normalish.

** wow, that second part was written fast. 145k in half a year

also, concerning Sirius in part 1 - he was crazy toward the end and not all that coherent. Past may have been more nuanced but we ended up with more calcified remains of his recollections after his ordeals. Fanfic authors need to pick which parts of source material will be in and which will be discarded - and apparently Sirius didn't have a place in this one.

Also, I hate/love this story. It is very engrossing to read, but the world he created and the society he describes is just depressing to follow. I mean... I've read "Voldermort won" fics that had a more cheerful feel to them. This book is like 1984 in terms of mood.

*** My problem is that the Sirius arc wasn't resolved properly, it just felt abrupt and stale. I felt that was a really good opportunity to have Sirius going off on a long monologue and reveal some backstory.
