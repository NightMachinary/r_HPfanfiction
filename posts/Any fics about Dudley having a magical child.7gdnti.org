Either he marries a witch and they have a child, or he marries a muggle and they have a magical child. Would like to see the reactions of his parents and Harry and see how it all pans out.

Does the child get ridiculed for being the offspring of the family that abused the famous Harry Potter?!?

Does Dudley's parents disown him or the child?!?

Would be interested to see!!!

  Minerva needs help delivering another letter to #4 Privet Drive. At forty, Dudley is not at all what Harry expects. A long overdue conversation ensues. DH cannon compliant, but probably not the way you think. Prologue to "Snape's Memories".

** Holly at Hogwarts is pretty decent. Dudley's changed his name to "Dillon Wycliff" and has two children, one of whom is the titular Holly. Dudley does not like his daughter being a witch at all, and he's really uncomfortable with all the magic stuff, but he tries to be supportive, even if he doesn't really want to know anything about what she does at Hogwarts.

(Story is based on the books ONLY, so it contradicts a lot of things from interviews and Pottermore and all that stuff. One of the more interesting ideas is Luna Lovegood as Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher.)
