Hi,

I have been working on my first fic and I would love some feedback.

Background:

I wrote “The Stirring” because I was tired reading fics with a kind, polite Snape. What makes him interesting to me is that he's cruel and ugly but also gifted and technically on the “good-side”.

The protagonist is an OC final year student and the story focuses on how her sexuality begins to overwhelm her.

It's not really [OC/Snape] because it isn't a romance, but there will be eventual sexual interactions between them (so if you don't approve of fictional relations between an 18 and a 35-year-old then it mightn't be for you).

(I've never posted on reddit before so I apologise if anything is off)

Thanks :D

  A final year Ravenclaw student has an awkward problem and Professor Snape may be the only one able to help. Rated M for language and sexual content.
