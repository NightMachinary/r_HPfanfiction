  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

** linkffn(Eclipse of the Sky, Harry Potter and the Elemental's Power) are also some good believable romances.

Also worth considering imo even though it's not harry is linkffn(You'll be the death of me) with Neville/OFC. I've put reading that off for a while since it wasn't Harry-centric and honestly after reading it I regret doing that.

It has a similar slow pacing to The Legacy (HP/DG) but isn't an angst train written specifically to make the boy suffer by making every interaction between them a misunderstanding or making characters like wet cardboard specifically for the sake drama like Black Bond (HP/OFC). Speaking of black bond, it's sadly the best fic with a HP/OFC pairing around Sirius' fictional daughter and that's not a compliment. HP/fem!HP fics are also in the same boat, all of them so far have very poor romance.

  The magical world has been split between wizards and magi for centuries, and both sides are happy to pretend the other does not exist. Unfortunately all good things must come to an end as Harry Potter finds himself growing up on the wrong side of the magical divide. Harry Potter/ Nasuverse AU. Sporadic updates.

  AU. OC: Graces Malfoy, Draco's twin sister. Neville, with his usual bad luck, ends up partners with Graces Malfoy for Herbology, just after landing her father in Azkaban, after the Ministry ordeal. Will this partnership prove to be as awful as it sounds? 6th year. Rated M for sexual content.
