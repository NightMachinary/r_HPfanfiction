** I touched on this in a discarded draft I did. It was overdone as a whole, so I just deleted it. Anyway, the price for Basilisk venom /was/ insanely high, more money than anyone would ever know, but it was a trap to lure people into the Ministry and to be tossed in jail for illegal breeding of XXXXX creatures.

In the end, I simply decided against it and just waved it all away, claiming Basilisk pieces would instantly disintegrate when the creature died, something about the blood burning all the scales alive. The only way to get the parts was to gather it from a live Basilisk, and they were too prideful to give it up, even to a Parselmouth.

** The Hogwarts Basilisk should be worth a bunch even without the typical potions stuff. The novelty of owning the skeleton of the hundreds of years old Basilisk from the fabled Chamber of Secrets should be worth a small fortune for some pure bloods.

The observation, that just leaving the carcass down there to rot, is utter lunacy is a fair one made by lots of fanfictions, but as you pointed out the "Harry gets a fortune from the Basilisk corpse" trope has become super cliche. So if it were up to me I'd just find a way to get rid of the corpse.

** I think you're discounting some things. Making a Basilisk is easy but it's impossible to make it safe. It's capable of killing a wizard from birth by two means that are really easy to fall prey to with a moments inattention: "Oops, I looked it in the eye" or "Oops, I didn't notice it hatch and it bit me. Too bad I don't have a phoenix on hand...".

Basilisk parts are almost certainly very valuable (not absurdly so, but enough that you might be tempted I'd wager) but it's just not worth the risk when you can use dragon skin and such. The fangs probably have no real equivalent though.

** I have a snippet that I wrote with a Harvester!Harry that sort of starts to explore this idea. I can send it to you if you want, but it's not very long.

*** I wouldn't mind that at all. I've always though that would be an awesome concept. Harry with parseltongue is uniquely suited to the venom business in particular. Some snakes venom can be sold for massive sums per gram, and Harry can pretty much eliminate the risk if he can actually walk the snakes through the process.

** Since basilisks are made, not bred, if there was anything economically worth harvesting off the blighters, 'basilisk farmer' would be a job you could get. Now, maybe there is such a thing and Harry just never comes across it during the books - dragon farmers are clearly a thing, since dragon parts are sold as a commodity on Diagon Alley. Whether the dragon reserve that Charlie Weasley works on is also a dragon farm - there's a "wild boar reserve" near me that sells the meat, it's basically a farm you can visit to look at the animals - isn't said either.

*** I think the problem is Basilisks are even more dangerous than dragons. They're not just massive (something like 60 feet long or more) but they can kill with a look and have incomparably acidic venom. So it would obviously have valuable parts like dragons (the fangs we know have worthwhile use) but since a Basilisk is mortally dangerous from birth it's just not feasible economically.

It's a bit like nuclear weapons in that regard. Oh sure it'd be worth tons if you could sell a nuke. Good luck doing it given just the danger of being near radioactive materials.

That's a health-and-safety-at-work issue, though, not an insurmountable obstacle: the more dangerous the production process the more you charge the customer. Nuclear materials are, as you say, dangerous, but there are safety procedures in place for working with them - there's a nuclear fuel processing plant just about visible from my house, and I know a couple of the workers there socially. The procedures for dealing with Uranium Hexaflouride are more than a little stringent, I'm told.

Now, that resulting price may well mean that nobody can afford to deal with basilisk-sourced ingredients so the knowledge has either been lost or was never discovered to start with, which removes the economic incentive to devise safety measures for farming the beasts.

***** The issue is two-fold though. Dragonskin is apparently plentiful enough that every Hogwarts student (and presumably every other school student, likely anyone making potions anywhere) has a pair. And they're likely just as effective at blocking or weakening magical effects as Basilisk skin. So the demand for that would be low since an equivalent alternative is readily there. The Basilisk fang is another story, but given it's powerful enough to destroy anything (Horcruxes included) probably anyone needing a powerful acid would use anything else.

And consider, dragonskin is taken from a dead adult dragon. You're not getting diddly from a baby Basilisk (doubt the skin would be matured enough to risk it at that point), and you surely can't let it grow to an adult to harvest its materials. According to Pottermore, the main impetus preventing dark wizards (who'd obviously want a powerful beast) from pumping them out is that the Basilisk usually kills the person who hatches them. Production is only possible if it's actually possible to produce them. And short of being a Parseltongue it doesn't look to be possible, so now I'm not actually sure there's an incentive for it. Either it's too expensive to be worth it (because getting it safely and in abundance doesn't seem possible) or no one would bother due to the alternatives and so it'd be priced lower.

*** That's pretty much true. Dragons just can't be allowed to roam free since they are pretty much armored fire breathing, flying violations of the Statute of Secrecy. I'd assume that dragons are farmed as well.

** It might be getting old that the basilisk is basically sold in "every second fic" - but then again:

It is a damned magical snake that can basically kill everything (even Dragons have a hard time fighting it!), not to mention that this one is ANCIENT (at least a thousand years old!) so yeah, people would want parts (scales, venom, teeth, bones, skin, organs etc.)! Hell, the very fact that Harry killed it is probably worth a markup! Seriously there's bad childrens books in HP that tell bad stories (seriously unrealistic, even in a world of magic!) that have Harry's name attached to them and they probably do sell (Ginny had them!), so yeah:

Harry's fame sells! Books and probably even basiliks parts (even if there are no potions that use them - which is probably unlikely, as getting basilisks is rather easy, I bet dark wizards did have them from time to time, maybe the DoM, too etc.)
