  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him.

  The conclusion of the AO3 work Sarcasm and Slytherin. Chapters 1-16 are available here. https://archiveofourown.org/works/15848610/chapters/36912186This is Sunmoonandstars, back from the dead. Original work summary: Harry Potter returns for his fifth year at Hogwarts amidst an increasingly unstable political situation. And this year, for the first time, Hogwarts is no longer firmly under Albus Dumbledore's control. Threats inside and outside the school put pressure on some of Harry's closest friendships, and power struggles lie beneath the surface of every faction in the brewing conflict. At its center is the Potter family, and Harry's position is more critical, and more precarious, than ever.Happy reading everyone. I have no clue when book 6 is going to be done or ready to post but have at least the end of book 5 because it's been languishing on my hard drive for too long.

*** A lot of tropes in this fic seems like cliches now, but they mostly weren't cliches yet when the fic was written. Second this rec, one of the best and most epic HP fanfics of all time imo.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
