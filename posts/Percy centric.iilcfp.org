(I have a few prompts to share but I wont do it all today)

*this isn't meant to bash anyone. I'm just trying to be realistic

*set between book 5 but before 7

Percy becomes estranged from his family. It's sudden after seemingly growing cold and distant. His family is heartbroken at first but then they seem to move on. No one speaks about Percy and if they do, they're terse and hateful. Most of the Weasleys (except for the twins) try to just move on and forget about the lost son after some time passes and they realize it's happening for good; that he isn't coming back

For Harry, he starts to feel unsure. Percy wasn't his favorite but he didn't think that he deserved all of it. He tries to talk some sense into Ron and Ginny but they stubbornly ignore him and change the subject

More time passes. Harry and the twins start to notice signs that something isn't right and begin to suspect something is wrong. They eventually sneak out to the Ministry of Magic so they can try to talk to Percy but then they spot Percy being tied up and struggling. Turns out Minister Fudge has been using the imperius curse on him so Percy would follow him and not his family because they know Harry

Cue a battle between them and Voldemort might or might not show up

So, what do y'all think? I haven't figured out all the details yet but it sounds cool. I might write it


** I dont think the twins would be the ones noticing something off with the way Percy acts. Even bevor the rift in Canon the twins dont really care for Percy, trying to avoid him or at most Prank him. After he leaves they are especially spitefull if my memory serves well. If you wanna have a weasly notice maybe Ginny or bill? I dont know. Fells like the prompt could deteriorate to weasly bashing quite fast. You could also let Percy be found by Audrey (is she his Canon love interest or is that just fanon?), thinking up a belivable backstory for her, how she got close enough to him in the ministry to notice something was off (maybe let her be a frind of Fleur so you do get the other weasleys involved thought that) and then let her be his hero or something.
