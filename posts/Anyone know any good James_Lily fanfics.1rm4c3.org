looking for any good ones.


** Hi. When you read/obsess over this please don't hate me too much. Jewel writes in the JK Rowling style and her fanfic "The life and times" is stunningly accurate. I've never read anything so beautiful. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5200789/1/The-Life-and-Times]]

Disclosure -Reg Cattermole makes appearances and Nevilles parents are BALLERS

Let me know what you think!

**** It's not finished! Jules has a blog (itreallyatemyhand.tumblr.com) where she talks about it (and posts extra information / deleted excerpts), and she's started chapter 37 already. She also has a page on there where she links her favorite stories, many of which are Lily/James and which tend to be very good ([[http://handlessreadingcorner.blogspot.com/]]). I haven't been able to find another novel-length L/J fic that lives up to the really high bar set by TLAT, but I have found some shorter stories that I like:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3730343/1/So-The-Story-Goes]] - sad, slightly more abstract oneshot near the end of their lives

[[http://fanfiction.mugglenet.com/viewstory.php?sid=87015&warning=5]] - James and Lily growing up (as a couple, not from childhood) told in 10 short vignettes

Sorry for the potentially poorly formatted links - I am on my iPad. Hope you like some of these stories!

** The best one I've ever read is Before They Fall, by JChrissy: [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=315315]]

Full disclosure: I beta read for this story.

Fuller disclosure: The ending will stomp all over your feels.
