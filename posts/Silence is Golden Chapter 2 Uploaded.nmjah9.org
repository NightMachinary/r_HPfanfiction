*** Absolutely! The story is about Daisy, a girl in the year below Harry, Ron and Hermione. When she was a baby, she was accidentally hit by an overpowered Silencing Charm, and was rendered completely mute, permanently.

A lot of the story will explore the difficulties Daisy faces learning magic and interacting with her peers in a world where people are constantly shouting spells, which she is obviously unable to do. Silence does have its perks, however. Since she makes no sound at all, not even footsteps, it's easier to sneak around and not be heard. Since she becomes friends with Ginny, it will also see how her presence in the story will affect canon events.

I hope you have the time to check it out!

** I didn't get a chance to comment on the first chapter, so I may as well here!

I'm very much enjoying the story, you have no idea how refreshing it is to hear things from not only another perspective, but another year. Not that I mind Harry and his yearmates, but there's only so many stories to be told from them.

I adore Daisy and Ginny's friendship, they seem just right for each other. The part where they said they'd protect each other was very sweet. I can't help but wonder how much this will affect certain canon events. (don't tell me though, I'd much rather learn when those chapters come out!)

Daisy's father seems great and I look forward to learning more about him. Flitwick is nice to, glad he asked her before sharing to the class.

I look forward to seeing where this series goes!
