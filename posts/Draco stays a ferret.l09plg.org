Prompt/request from my 12-year-old: For whatever reason, Barty Crouch Jr.'s transfiguration of Draco can't be reversed, so he just stays a ferret.


** "Moody, we never use transfiguration as a punishment!" said Professor McGonagall weakly.

"I didn't. I was just trying to /Finite/ whatever charms Malfoy uses on his hair. How was I supposed to know that he was really a ferret transfigured into a human?"

McGonagall waved her wand at the panicking ferret. Her frown deepened when nothing happened, and she cast several more spells with increasing desperation.

Eventually, her shoulders sagged in defeat. "Against all common sense, it appears you were correct. How could this ever have happened?"

"Hah! We both know the crowds Malfoy, the human one, used to hang around with." Moody's smile turned predatory. "He probably had an unfortunate encounter with a castration curse, and had to improvise."

** I've read a similar fic but it is NOT appropriate for a 12 year old.

Edit: here's a link. It's not anything awful just some smut later. (No beastiality just trapped animagus nonsense). It's actually marvelously written and feels very well paced and natural.

**** Hes trapped in his animagus form for most of the time. I clarified because smut+story where Draco is a ferret= questionable click.

** I like Heroes Assemble, Harry cracks up when he realizes Draco's patronus is a ferret.

** Have Lucius and Narcissa unknowingly adopt him as a pet and have the transfiguration reverse after 30-40 years. It will be an angsty fic.
