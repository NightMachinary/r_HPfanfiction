I cannot for the life of me find this, and I've read it more than once - but I want to read it again. In this fic, Harry discovers(can't remember how, but something to do with Dementors) the ability to see the webs that bind other species/beings to wizards/ministry.

Specifically, he releases the Dementors from the webs first, eventually Dobby, Goblins in the South(I think, could be North), Unicorns, and others. Harry is powerful(enough to scare people) but claims neither light nor dark, and this is why he is able to release them from their bindings.

Edit: Sorry, title is supposed to say LF. :/


** Sounds like the Sacrifices Arc, starting with linkffn(Saving Connor)

  AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE

** I don't like HPDM, and have stayed away from this story for such a reason, but after that interesting little tid-bit I have to read it now. If this story makes me start to enjoy such a pairing i'm going to blame you.

Thanks,\\

*** Haha, I'm not a huge fan of HP/DM either and honestly I don't like their dynamic in this(I feel like it's too controlling) but the main plot is so interesting I just bear it and grin. :)

**** How is it too controlling. Sorry i'm just not clear if you mean the story, Harry, Draco, etc...

***** Harry and Draco's relationship. It's pretty slow and takes quite a long time to develop to anything close to romantic, but Draco often treats Harry like a child or someone he's responsible for instead of an equal. "Punishing" him when he does something he's said he won't, etc. The author stays true to the characters as they are written(not canon) though, and fleshes out a lot of characters we normally don't see.

****** I'm not sure, I greatly hate submissive anyone in stories, unless it's done for comedic purpose, but with how you said Draco treats Harry that put me right off it again.

******* Well, the dynamic is that's how Draco treats him but Harry either doesn't notice it, but is also not submissive. What is nice is the relationship does grow to be more equal as they both learn, as all the relationships grow and change in the story. It's realistic, I guess - I just dislike people like the Draco in this particular story if that makes sense? It's still very well written in my opinion.
