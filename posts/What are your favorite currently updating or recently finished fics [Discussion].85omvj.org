Looking for people to talk about their favorite current fics. I would consider anything that has updated within say the past 6 months to fall within that category. I have many and will probably chime back in with some more later but I think my absolute favorite right now is Limpieza de Sangre by TheEndless7. Emily is my favorite incarnation of Lord Voldemort that I have read to date. She manages to be the Dark Lord that caused the deaths of so many innocents while at the same time managing to be a caring mentor to Harry. As you start to learn how Emily Riddle transformed into Lord Voldemort you can't help but sympathize with her. The story is currently at a point where the author could end it if she chose to do so, but I sincerely hope that she instead chooses to have this just be the beginning of a new tale.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

  There's nobody like her. She's smart, beautiful, and witty. Unfortunately for Harry, she's also engaged. When Fleur Delacour returns to Hogwarts to help prepare for the war against Voldemort, Harry has to manage an uneasy balance between the demands of the war and the demands of the heart.

#+begin_quote
  Growing up as the middle child of war heroes is already hard enough as it is. How much harder can it be when everyone seems to think that you're a little girl? That's what the second-born child of Neville and Hannah Longbottom asks all the time, as he's the only one that knows the truth: he's a boy, no matter what everyone else tells him. He is Dean Longbottom. This is his story.

  Todd Ollivander can't seem to shake his feelings for the new apprentice at his father's wand shop. It's not a good time to be distracted, as it's becoming clearer and clearer that Ollivander's is a major target of Lord Voldemort's during the First Wizarding War.

** I'm really enjoying linkffn(puzzle by we-built-the-shadows-here). A lot of people can't stand the Snape/Lily pairing but it's done really well in this post-war Voldemort won fic.

Also, shout out to linkffn(reign of the serpent by AlphaEph19) which updated the other day so that totally still counts! :)

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

  Power is a fickle mistress. You court her for centuries, nourish her, shelter her from those who are unworthy, and everything is as it should be. But then, she laughs, stabbing you in the back with cold daggers of reckoning. Still, the Blacks aren't overly discouraged. They've been at this dance longer than anyone else, they know one thing for certain: an old flame never dies. AU

** linkao3(Unforgiven Pride by Laziza) is a pretty good Snape Lives story. It updates a bit erratically, but the chapters are pretty long and the plot is intricate and interesting.

linkao3(Picketing for Peace by Chuksha) is from this January and probably my favorite story written this year so far.

  Severus Snape never expected to go back to Spinner's End. But when news of the 1984 Miner's Strike, and subsequent sympathy picket in Cokeworth, hit the Daily Prophet front pages he couldn't help himself, even if that meant facing his estranged father.This story was a submission for Age range category 3 (20-30 years old) in the 2018 Snape Showcase over on LJ which has been publishing Snape!centric fics to coincide with Sev's birthday and #SnapeWeek. Beta'd by the fantastic Snarry5evr. snapecase: Celebrating Severus Snape throughout his ages!

  Post-war politics is just as deadly as ever, when you are called Severus Snape and you are accused of war crimes... But when past students who should hate you prove to be your staunchest allies, you might just decide that life is worth living. Many canon characters. Adult themes. Slow build. EWE. Continuation of Unforgiven Love but can be read independently.I'm not JKR, I don't own anything about Harry Potter, and I don't make any money.
