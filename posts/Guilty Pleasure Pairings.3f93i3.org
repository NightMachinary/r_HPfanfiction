Like the title says, what is your guilty pleasure couple?

I have no shame, I love Snape/Harry and Snape/Hermione...especially the former. I guess their uh, complex relationship really appeals to me?

I also read this beautifully written crack!pairing of Bellatrix/Hermione...never thought I'd say this, but I loved it and it is a weird guilty pairing now too. Thanks a lot, fanfiction.

I like a load of weird pairings...Fem!Harry, Tom Riddle/Harry, Sirius/Hermione...crack pairs. Ugh. I.Have.No.Shame.

Carry on!


** I guess Snape/Hermione or Draco/Hermione. Every once in a while I apparently like to read the equivalent of trashy romance novels set in Hogwarts using just the names of the characters and maybe a few of their cherry-picked qualities.

** femharry/voldemort. I mean, he killed her parents, this is not a good basis for a relationship... Yet there are some really trashy stories where I actually like it.

hermione/voldemort too. Let's date someone who leads an organization hellbent on eradicating my demographic? Though those tend to be better written from what I've seen.

  Being the Master of Death was a curse, plain and simple. That had been death's intention when he 'gifted' his trinkets to the brothers three.

***** I'm totally fine with non-sibling incest in fanfics, I don't give a shit. The cousin thing is fine with me as well, especially if they're not first cousins than it isn't even a remote problem. And well, even if they're first cousins - its a fanfic guys. And it was (is?) still a part of culture for some.

Calm down, folks.

On the other hand, I very rarely read sibling-incest and don't do the whole "parental-incest" thing. Not...something I'm into in all honesty.

I REALLY want some Sirius/Tonks fanfics. Somehow the thought of such opposite personalities together amuses me - I think they'd work together really well! (And wait a minute, if I recall...wasn't Tonks' mum Sirius' first cousin? Doesn't that make Tonks and Sirius second cousins?)

****** Sure thing! I love getting to share my favourite contributions to the HMS Prudence and Potions. ;)

Fair warning: I tend to like epics, and I don't shy away from explicit material. Though not everything I like is all that long, I don't typically do one-shots. And not everything I like is NC-17, either, but I don't tend to mark out most stories in my head by the presence/lack of explicit content. So, basically, I don't remember relative lengths or ratings on the vast majority of these. If those are concerns for you, I recommend reading the authors' synopses before beginning reading! :)

Anyway, here're a few for you to take a look at. :) If there're any recs you'd like to make in return (I haven't read everything!), I'd love that! :D

- [[http://www.witchfics.org/fr/][Fire and the Rose by Abby and Anne]] -- The one that got me into liking the 'ship. :) I frequently rec this one to people to introduce them to HG/SS in general.
- [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=2981][Somewhere I Have Never Travelled by Strangeland]] -- Time Travel, but not the usual way
- The Phoenix Trilogy by grangerous ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4763572/1/Phoenix-Song-or-Hermione-Granger-and-the-HB-P][Phoenix Song]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5129305/1/Phoenix-Tears-or-Hermione-Granger-and-the-DH][Phoenix Tears]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7600629/1/Phoenix-Fire-or-Hermione-Granger-and-the-EW][Phoenix Fire]]) -- companion 'fic to HBP, DH, and replaces the epilogue. All three are epics and wonderful.
- [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=1574][Cloak of Courage by WendyNat]] -- Written pre-HBP; features lots of interesting Dark Arts theory.
- [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=12541][Vanity by Wartcap]] -- companion 'fic to HBP; time travel; very funny in places
- [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=2665][Unfinished Business by Ramos]] -- Ghosts!
- [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=2002][Soul Searching by Quillusion]] -- somewhat older 'fic, but kind of classic, imo
- [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=20534][The Problem with Purity by Silver Birch]] -- Epic length, innovative magic ideas. Also involves H/D (ancillary pairing)
- [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=250][Time Does Not Heal All Wounds by WendyNat]] -- This is in my to-reread pile; it's been a while and literally the only thing I remember is loving it, LOL. It also has a sequel, [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=646][Some Scars Never Fade]].

*** I'm curious as to what the draw of Snape paired with anyone is. My interpretation of him from canon is a petty, abusive, vindictive, arrogant, asshole. His only redeeming qualities are intelligence and magical talent. Many call him brave but he only turned on and fights against Voldemort because V killed the women he was obsessed with.

**** So, different readers and writers have different reasons why they find him interesting to pair off with people.

Certainly, the best fanfics preserve the canon traits he has, such as having a truly appalling temper, being vindictive, arrogant, snarky, intelligent, and an asshole -- but they also tend to ascribe to him the /positive/ sides of those traits. In canon, Harry (our sole viewpoint character) is the person absolutely least likely to ascribe any positive traits to him whatsoever, but inherent with a such a limited viewpoint is the possibility that /other/ characters interpret him /differently/, and fanfic takes advantage of that.

In Snape-centric fanon, he's generally presented as a snarky, cynical, brooding, passionate (in canon, this is generally seen as anger, but you can see some of his passion for his craft in his opening speech in SS/PS), brilliant (frequently emphasizing his canon skills in creating/refining potions and spells), /sexy/ (essentially never for his appearance, but most often for his voice and the way he moves and his manner), confident, strongly principled man.

His defection from Voldemort in 'fic written either after the revelation of his love for Lily or with that as the author's headcanon (a very common headcanon, even for people who ship Snape with other people), was due to /love/ (which you interpret as "obsession"). His fanon reasons for /joining/ Voldemort in the first place (not discussed in canon, to the best of my recollection) are generally not due to any adherence to Voldemort's racist rhetoric, but other causes -- often, an interest in Dark Arts or a thirst for revenge against someone (frequently James Potter and/or his own father) -- which means that when Voldemort betrays Snape by targetting the woman he loves despite him begging Voldemort not to, Snape turns coat to try to protect her. (Remember, Snape /did/ turn /before/ the Potters were dead.)

His status as a double agent is almost always a subject of interest for fanfic writers, too -- the tension inherent in such a position and the need for him to maintain his cover /despite/ any personal feelings he might have allow for a lot of leeway regarding his outright cruelty towards others. (After all, even in the years when Voldemort was believed dead, Malfoy and many of the other Death Eaters were at large and could easily make his life hell, if not murder him outright if they suspected he /hadn't/ been trying to play Dumbledore for a fool.)

So, basically, a lot of it comes down to interpretation and personal opinion -- like everything else in fanfiction. :)

A lot of people don't see this, they like to romanticise Snape and tend to forget the bits where he tries to get Lupin the dementor's kiss because he doesn't like him, where he enjoys tormenting Harry while he's trying to save Crouch Sr, where he forces kids to do horrible, painful detentions, where Snape was a willing death-eater for ages before the prophecy, where he forces Harry to dive into a freezing pond to get the sword for lolz or where Snape sells the Order out with the seven Harrys thing even though he's already Voldemorts right-hand man after killing Dumbledore and doesn't need to prove himself any further.

I can't remember what other crap he's done but the sum of it is that Snape is an arse who deserved a much more painful death.

I always feel like Snape could have said to Voldemort: "I had to act like a decent human being to convince Dumbledore." but instead chose with Dumbledore to act like a bastard to convince Voldemort.

If you've got some pro-Snape points then please let me know them but they'll have to be bloody good to convince me after he tried to have Lupin kissed.

************ All the while 3 children are proclaiming Black's innocence, which Snape should instantly be able to see as true if he's as much of a super!Legilimens as the later books claim him to be.

Also, depending on when Snape looks at the map (which doesn't show the shack) he either sees Lupin chasing after Sirius, Ron, Harry et al. or he sees Lupin going into the tunnel by himself. If he saw the earlier he would have no reason to not assume that Lupin saw the map and is off to confront Black (in which case he could have taken the wolfsbane potion that was with him at the time to the shack) or he sees Lupin going to where he was able to transform safely by himself and he had no-reason to go at all. There is no reason for Snape not to bring the Wolfsbane other than him being an arse.

I can see how Snape reacts in the shack from your point of view, but even then with Granger asking him to stop and listen to them he doesn't. He acts in an unreasonable and arseholic way because, although he is one of the good guys, he is in fact and unreasonable arsehole.

**** Here's the thing, though--we know that from cannon /now/. I started reading fanfiction with Snape as a main character (or at least a primary influence) only a bit after the fifth book was published, and much of it had been written before (or ignored) the fifth book. Back then, Snape was very much an ambiguous, intriguing character. Was he on Dumbledore's side or wasn't he? He was a complete arse to Harry, but he was trying to help him and protect the Stone in the first book, and he went up against a werewolf to protect the students in the third. We find out that he had been bullied by Harry's dad and his friends in the fifth.

By the time the sixth book came out I had come across many different characterizations of Snape--both good and bad, but mostly good--for years and that definitely clouded how I interpreted cannon, how I reacted to it. Then afterwards we had two years to wonder--was Snape actually on Dumbledore's side, or Voldemort's? Tons of new Snape-centric fanfiction (ok, a lot of fanfiction in general but I mostly read Snape-centric stuff) came out in this period exploring his motivations, his excuses, his background, everything. Every time I'd read an intriguing opinion, I'd think to myself, "I wonder if/how Rowling will cover/explain/include this in the real book?"

Unfortunately, I found myself having the same thoughts while reading the seventh book shortly after it came out. I had to remind myself that this /was/ the real book, it wasn't just another fanfic that I could ignore and dismiss as unimportant if I didn't like it. And I was so, so disappointed by the way Rowling wrapped up Snape's story. I had seen him as an unpleasant man who did the right thing not because he wanted people to like him, not because he thought he'd get anything out of it, but because it's Right. He had made a grave mistake in his past and he was doing everything in his power to make up for it despite thoroughly despising the other people he worked with and for. Instead, Rowling made his primary motivation his obsession with another man's wife and Dumbledore's manipulations.

/That's/ why I'm drawn to fanfiction involving Snape--not because I love his characterization in cannon, but because I don't. I read Snape-centric fanfiction so I can read about the character I "knew" before the seventh book came out. I read Snape-centric fanfiction so I can read about a man who got the short end of the stick time after time after time--an abusive childhood, parents with a broken marriage, really unpleasant looks, a complete inability to socialize normally, an unpleasant personality/disposition (no doubt exacerbated by his upbringing), being sorted into the "evil" house, being endlessly bullied by the "popular" kids in school, whose only friends (besides Lily) were only his friends to use him for his abilities, who made a horrible mistake that affected for ill the whole rest of his life--and who nonetheless is able to redeem himself and find peace with himself and his past and find his version of a happy ending instead of dying cold and alone on the floor of the Shrieking Shack. I read Snape-centric fanfiction because it shows that the world is not just black and white--unpleasant people can still be good people, and you don't have to fit in someone else's cookie-cutter mold of "that's just what nice people do!" to be admirable. I read Snape-centric fanfiction because it gives me hope.

The romance aspect is just icing on the cake. :-)

But seriously in retrospect, I think that the ending that was originally given to THAW is the one that is the most realistic in that situation, and it almost feels like a Shakespearean tragedy in that respect. It's what the consequences of the plot threads lead to, and it tears your heart out of your chest, and that's the end of the story. It achieves a sort of catharsis, and while I love reading "A Good Elf" because it turns that around and is likewise also cathartic (because we get to see them reunited once more as they were in the beginning), THAW proper has a perfectly legitimate ending.

I really enjoy linkffn(one hundred and sixty nine by Mrs J's Soup) but I know some people felt like it dragged on a little bit. Has some scenes that made me crack up on the first read through.

I enjoyed the interactions and overall story in this one, but felt like it would have been much better expanded and broken up a little bit. linkffn(temporality by fangirlwithak)

I think linkffn(reason for life by ladyseradereturns) is a good one, and if you need smuttier smut, I believe the uncut versions are also on her blog that you can find through her bio page. She's got a couple good stories.

***** Ages ago I read this Sirius/Hermione story called Lavender and Lace - I thought it was going to be some smutty, trashy crap...boy was I wrong!

It was this fantastic non-magic AU set in mid-1800's England where Sirius is a roguish, charming man who is losing his fortune thanks to his own bad behavior and recklessness while Hermione is a bookish young maid working in his household who becomes his confidant. It had a very slow developing, very realistic relationship/romance and correct mannerisms/behavior for the time with very in-character characters.

SUCH a good story, but sadly I think the author deleted it. I cannot find it anyway.

** Hmmmmmm

Harry/Fem!Voldemort, Harry/Lily, Harry/Charlie, Hermione/Charlie, Snape/Lockhart.... as long as both characters actually have canon characterizations (none of this Daphne Greengrass stuff) and stick to them (/cough/ Harmony /cough/), I'm a happy camper. The more surprising the better.

Plus, if you can convince me of Snockhart, that already says loads about your talent as a writer

There are really far too many Fem!Harry/Voldemort fanfictions out there, and not enough of these.

** I don't know if I'd really call any pairing a guilty pleasure, but I guess fem!Harry/anyone or Harry/harem. I don't really know if either count. To be honest, I never really understood the concept of a guilty pleasure.

** Probably Harry/Fleur or Harry/Tonks.

Er... I may also be one of the few who actually ships this but I do like Harry/Ron/Herimone. As a trio. There aren't many fics like that out there. Also quite like James/Sirius if it's implied but not overt, ya know? Or Sirius/Lily (same as before, implied not necessarily overt). Or James/Sirius/Lily. As a trio.

*** I'm quite a fan of that dynamic as well! The problem is, we don't get a lot of options on the het side of the fandom. I usually have to resort to the rare Harry/Pansy fic, and even then it so seldom turns to a real romance. I think It's Just Sex and its abandoned sequel are the only ones.

** Snape/Draco. I wonder where my shame's gone to. I've never thought about this pairing, ever, I don't even like Draco that much, but once I saw them mentioned somewhere together and thought about it, it all started to make a disturbingly huge amount of sense. It just...works for me.
