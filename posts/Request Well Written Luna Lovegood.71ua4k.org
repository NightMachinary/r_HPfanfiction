I love Luna Lovegood's character, she's one of my favorite characters in the series. But the problem is that the writers tend to write her too random/weird/crazy not make any sense. Which while she is weird and random she does normally at least make some sort of sense.

Plus she was the one to get Harry to talk after Sirius died and she was the one who realized that it was Harry when he was polyjuiced.

She might have had some weird theories, but for the most part she did make some sort of sense. (Normally towards the end).

I want well written and beliavble Luna Lovegood.

Any rating is fine, am fine with any pairing het/slash/femmeslash.

Doesn't have to have Luna Lovegood as a main character, she could be a minor character or whatever, just written believably.

If a multi-chapter would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine.

Those two authors write Luna wonderfully.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10393778/1/The-Biter-Bit]]) Is an excellent fic, it hasn't updated in a while though the author assured me he was still working on it when I reviewed some time ago.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7086910/1/Retroactive]]) has an excellent Luna also.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6619152/1/Harry-and-the-Hobgoblins]]) Arguably a bit OOC, but still an amusing take on the character.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5136938/1/Innocence-and-Roses]]) Crazy awesome.

  It's the morning after Ginny and Ron's fight in Half-Blood Prince, and she can't concentrate in DADA class. Unfortunately, that means she incurs the wrath of Snape. But somebody in the class has had enough of Snape's bullying and decides to take a stand. No longer a one-shot, and spinning out from HBP into something AU and silly. Harry/Luna.
