I'd love some feedback on anything, really. The chapters are quite short, it starts of pretty teenage-romance heavy, and I really enjoy writing it.


** Thoughts as I'm reading:

Your technical skill is great! Better than many I've read.

The fact that Ron didn't immediately deck someone "openly supporting" Voldemort is odd, considering they killed his two uncles. Even making a joke about it would probably sour things, I think.

The immediate jump into the action with no lead-up is a little jarring, but it's much better than the standard abbreviated overview of an OC's childhood leading up to Hogwarts, where not much plot is happening, and so the author feels compelled to stick to terrible jokes. That said, some earlier information about William's family's reputation would be nice. It's one thing when Harry doesn't know and has to rely on what others like Ron and Malfoy say about each other, it's another when your viewpoint character is literally a member of said family. We get the paragraph of info on William's grandfather a bit later down, but that's not the family's reputation as a whole, I don't think.

'Muggle' is usually capitalized, but I doubt anybody cares.

You're quite good at slipping descriptive language into the narrative without bogging down the pacing. The tone reminds me a lot of the earlier Potter books.

From memory, I think that's the canon Sorting Hat song? I know it bugs some people when you include it in a fic, but I've always just scrolled past it if I didn't feel like reading it again.

Oh, shit. He's read /Hogwarts, A History./ There goes half of Hermione's contributions to the plot (/s).

The timeskip is awfully jarring. If I were you, I might include the first two chapters as a flashback instead of the massive timeskip.

I typically prefer more back-and-forth for the fight in Book 4. Harry's staunch refusal to speak to Ron out of wounded pride did just as much to exacerbate that fight as Ron's initial comments.

Going pretty hard on the Idiot!Ron for someone who claims to love him. In canon, Ron only thought Harry put his name in the Goblet because they had literally discussed it the night before and Harry said if he could get away with it, he would. I guess William and Hermione's excursion is a factor in him literally attacking them?

You get a follow from me.

*** Thank you for your very detailed and thought out feedback! It really helps a lot. I'll try to answer your questions as well as I can.

I agree. I tried working it in but I just kept ruining the pacing, so I have included some more in later chapters.

Completely forgot that, I'll fix it (just for you!).

Made my day!

It is, and I didn't know that (haven't read many fics). A bit too late to fix that, though. At least I know now!

#+end_quote

Point well taken, I'll look into doing that.

I /do/ love Ron, mainly because I relate to him a hella lot. I would have probably been equally pissed as him, if not more, which is why I made him act a bit irrational (cause that's how I would have stupidly acted at 14 years old). But things will clear up regarding the small changes in character and events as the chapters roll out. I have 12 or something already pretty much done, just working out some kinks.

Thanks again!!!

** No thanks. This reads like pretty much every other story with a self insert, sorry "original character" joining the trio. Its nor really original or unique.

*** I figured it did (that's basically what it is), though I haven't read a lot of fics. This isn't really about being original for me, just about having fun in writing something.

Appreciate the feedback, though!
