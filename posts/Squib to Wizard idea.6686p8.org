I had the idea for a fic where a Squib, aware of their heritage, goes into genetic research and manages to kickstart their dormant magical gene and gain magic, any thoughts?


** i assume that descendants of squibs could become magicals again, although they were often thought as "Muggleborns".

** I was never a fan of (current) science being able to frame and explain magic. I always assumed that if you look at the DNA of wizards, squibs and muggles, you basically see the same. Magic doesn't do science. Magic mocks science.

Is a line you'll be able to read in one of my upcoming chapters.

*** If you use science to explain magic it just becomes science and stops being magic. Here lies the problem with midichlorians in Star Wars. I am however a fan of Magic being applied to technology.

*** I was thinking that this would (possibly at least) be in the future to some degree. WoG has confirmed that magic is based of genetics, and that Muggleborns are the descendants of Squibs, with their dormant magical genetics reactivating after generations.

But I do remember that Rowling once said that muggleborns are squib-descendants, or something like that.

** Magic being manipulatable via science is often the hallmark of a crap fic so You need to make it beyond obvious. Gene therapy could work, like kickstarting the ancient tech activation gene in stargate atlantis. But even that falls back to the obvious. Perhaps something along the lines of the super soldier serum of captain america could be the way. Where his best traits are magnified due to the magical variant of the sss.

*** I disagree, the idea that science can work with it is IMHO a great one (I mean it does in Star Wars - at least in the EU-Legends-Canon (!) - where the Force is basically magic (it can do most things magic can, except create stuff from nothing! It can however imitate transfiguration (Sith Alchemy!), Defense Against the Dark Arts (Jedi-Fighting techniques!), Dark Arts (Sith Sorcery!), Divination (future visions and combat-predictions (otherwise you could not intercept blaster bolts with a lightsaber!)) etc. etc.) and can be influenced by science (the Imperial Remnant managed to make crystals that gave normal people access to force abilities for example!)

**** There are tons of great stories where magic is properly studied like a science. Mistborn and Fullmetal ALchemist are my favorites.

There aren't a lot of good fanfics, however that do that. I think mostly because (1) defining a whole system of magic from the ground up is very difficult and (2) JK Rowling's magic isn't well defined. If you wanted to define it you'd have to change it substantially.

HPMOR and Prince of Slytherin (two fics with great magic systems imo) both heavily change how magic works in canon.

**** Midichlorians ruined it though. The force being used and manipulated was great but once they explained it took a lot away. What was that about the Imperial Remnats crystals though? I dont remember that, although its been a while since ive read most of the books granted.

*** I was thinking something like them comparing the DNA of themselves and their wizard relatives for similarities and noticing the difference, allowing them to find a way to activate the dormant gene(s).

**** Then magic is seen as subservient to known muggle science, when canon doesn't show that performing magic has any relation to muggle science.

It'd probably be more reasonable if the squib collaborated with a potioneer to kickstart their magic after activating their dormant genes. Then you get a nice mixture of the two instead of a Super Science Beats Magic showdown. The mixture of techniques would horrify blood purists too.

Or you could go really dark and have the squib steal a muggleborn's magic in an ironic twist on canon.

***** Alright, using magical components to help figure out the best way to jumpstart the magical gene(s) sounds like a good idea, but the stealing magic thing goes way against canon, and I'm not a fan of the idea for a few other reasons.

** Smutty, but related plot: linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/8376331]]). The plot involves an Unspeakable Hermione researching 'the Squib Problem' as magical birth rates fall and the Ministry tries to pass a Marriage/Procreation Law. BDSM, etc.

  When there's a significant drop in the magical population, stressed Unspeakable Hermione Granger finds the answer. The Wizengamot threatens a Marriage Law unless a temporary Procreation Bill can make them see reason. Fortunately for Hermione, her chosen spouse knows how to work out all of her tension.

** I would imagine a Squib being exactly the same as a wizard, except for on a metaphysical level, their magic is either blocked or being rerouted. Meaning any procedure to 'restore' their magic would have to either forcefully destroy the reason for the blockage or forcefully reroute the magic. Both are likely extremely painful (why most squibs don't take the risk) and could possibly give the user magic akin to Ariana Dumbledore's.
