(I keep getting this idea after reading Percy Weasley redemption or Spy fanfics. And I really hope other like this type of fanfic too.)

Percy was a very smart wizard. He knew that the ministry was wrong. He knew they were prejudiced, incompetent, horrible people. But this was politics and it needed a fine touch. Feeling horrible he cut ties with his family. Thinking along the lines of ‚ÄúI'll protect them for this is the only way.‚Äù He knew how to make puppets, port keys and many other magical gadgets so time to put his knowledge to use. Throughout the years he gained higher and higher clearance making fake documents and hiding the originals in a lightweight flammible box that never left his side. He port keyed those falsely incriminated out of England. He replacing them with puppets. He worked hard keeping hidden in order to do what he thought right.

On the final battle day he was caught with the fake documents. He grabbed the box and ran. Running he made it to hogs-hedge and joined his family in the fighting. When he saw the minister it was different. The minister confronted him demanding the documents. Percy of corse didn't.

(Anyways have at it if you like. And you can tweak this however ya like!)


** I love this!!!!

For years I hated Percy for only joining his family in the last battle. It wasn't until a few months ago that I read a fic and in it they said that for months leading up to the final battle, Percy was using his position in the Ministry to forge documents for Muggleborns to keep them safe and it felt like a slap to the face with how much more likely it was that he was doing underground spy work in the Ministry to help out. It's not even a headcanon for me anymore I'm 100% accepting it as canon because it makes more sense. The Weasleys didn't believe in blood prejudice and Percy was just an idiot not cold hearted!

(Also can you link some of those redemption/spy Percy fics please üòÅ)

** This was always something I internally sort of accepted; Percy's ambition finally gave way to fear, realising that the Ministry was nothing more than a puppet of Voldemort and the Death Eaters. Obviously Percy comes to his senses, no matter how much he wants to succeed, he knows that he can never do it by colluding with a government that goes against every principle he'd ever considered. Knowing that leaving and reaching out to his (known blood-traitor in the eyes of the new Ministry) family would arouse suspicion, and he couldn't risk a potential exposure to the Order, Percy slowly began to resist the only way he knew how: by working.

Thousands of documents pored over, sleepless night after sleepless night spent in the Ministry archives tirelessly correcting records to smuggle Muggleborns out of Britain, fake their deaths to avoid prosecution and switch around Snatcher orders to protect the innocent. Upon being found out, and logically surmising that the war would soon focus on Hogwarts, Percy fled to reconcile with his family, the Ministry hot on his tail...

(I may write something on this; it's a really interesting prompt)

** Percy would take one look at this thread and clarify that the box is "inflammable." :)

But yeah, as others have said already, Percy working undercover against the Ministry corruption is sort of a headcanon of mine already.

** Here's an excerpt from linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5537755/1/Amends-or-Truth-and-Reconciliation]]), a Hermione-centric epic that picks up after the Battle of Hogwarts. It's not a major part of the fic, nor is it a spoiler for anything:

#+begin_quote
  [Hermione] sits and presents her credentials from the War Crimes Commission, then says, ‚ÄúI'm looking for some documents from the diplomatic correspondence,‚Äù she says. She puts down on his desk the parchments she has. ‚ÄúI seem to be missing the French text for the extradition orders sent to the French Ministry for Magic and the final draft of the orders sent to Central Europe.‚Äù

  Percy looks at the scrivener's copies she has given him. ‚ÄúNo, these are final draft. You can request copies from the appropriate foreign Ministries to confirm.‚Äù

  ‚ÄúThis order was sent to the French Ministry in English text only?‚Äù

  Percy adjusts his spectacles on the bridge of his nose. ‚ÄúYes, this is the final version---see the date? You'll want to confirm with Paris, but this is how it went out.‚Äù

  She frowns. ‚ÄúBut you were in charge. You signed them, and I'm assuming you drafted them as well.‚Äù

  ‚ÄúThat's correct.‚Äù

  ‚ÄúAnd the language in these extradition orders to Central Europe---well, it just doesn't look like final draft.‚Äù

  Percy looks at her. ‚ÄúThese are the documents that went out. It seems you have a full set.‚Äù He adds pedantically, ‚ÄúOf course, you know that with them the official version is the Latin text.‚Äù He thumbs carefully through the stack for Central Europe and moves the Latin version to the top. ‚ÄúYou'll want to refer to that one in any correspondence.‚Äù

  ‚ÄúYes, well, but the language... it's not the way I would have written it if I wanted the extraditions to go through: ‚Äòwe hereby demand in the name of the greater good...'‚Äù

  He cuts her off. ‚ÄúThat's the way it went out. Again, you can confirm with the appropriate Ministries. I take full responsibility for the final text.‚Äù He runs a hand through his hair and sighs, looking tired. He's eyeing a stack of correspondence at his right elbow and clearly thinking about the next task at hand on his overcrowded desk.

  ‚ÄúThe extradition orders went out to Grindelwald country demanding things in the name of the greater good. That just seems calculated to... stir up bad memories.‚Äù Percy shrugs. Hermione wonders how explicitly to spell it out. There's something odd going on here. She knows that Voldemort came calling for Grindelwald in his cell at Nurmengard. He didn't go look up the local fifth column, because there wasn't one. Nor did the Death Eaters have much success trying to recruit foreign auxiliaries. Memories are long in that part of the world, and Grindelwald is not remembered fondly. So that language strikes her as conscious sabotage.

  As does the arrogant, commanding tone.

  As does the failure to address the French Ministry in French, when the Central European correspondence was sent out in six languages in addition to Latin.

  ‚ÄúPercy, do you mind if I ask you a personal question?‚Äù

  He looks up from the work on his desk.

  ‚ÄúWhen did you really switch sides?‚Äù

  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.
