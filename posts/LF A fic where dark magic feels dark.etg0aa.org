So many fics have the main characters argue that dark magic isn't really a thing, you can kill with almost any spell ect.

But are there any fics where dark magic actually has consequences to the caster? Where excessive use can hurt them, warp their personality or any other effects that make using it not as simple as casting wingardium leviosa

  Shortly before dying, Merope Gaunt gave birth to a pair of twins. As an infant, Mary Riddle was adopted by a caring family, leaving Tom alone at the orphanage. Naturally, when the twins reconcile at Hogwarts, they feel a great deal of affection for one another---affection that most would consider abnormal between a brother and a sister.

** linkffn(Too Young To Die)

Dark magic is incredibly addicting and basically works like a drug---especially the withdrawal. Harry gets addicted to it, and he frequently has to deal with the consequences.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

** The Albus Potter series deals with an aspect of dark magic that has consequences to the caster. I don't want to say to much, because it will be easy to spoil, but its very long (7 book series) and very good (imo).

Linkffn(Albus Potter and the Global Revelation) is Book 1.

The parts you're requesting don't really get seen until the later books, but they are there.

  *SERIES COMPLETE!* Book 1/7. Structured like original HP books. Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all. COMPLETE!

** Colubrina has some really good stories, my favorite of which are Lady of the Lake and Pygmalion. The characters both SAY that dark magic is no different but the author is really good at subtly showing you it is in fact twisting the characters.

A warning: the magic is often times really graphic, no rape but very violent. And some of her other stories are too much for me, but these two are really good.
