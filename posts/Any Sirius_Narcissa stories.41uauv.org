I've read a few stories where I liked the interaction between the two but i have never actually seen them paired.


** Didn't they get together in linkffn(Growing Up Black by Elvendork Nigellus)?

It wasn't a big focus of the story regardless, so it may not fit what you're looking for

  What if Harry had been rescued from the Dursleys at age six and raised as the heir of the Noble and Most Ancient, etc.? This is the story of Aries Sirius Black. AU. Part I complete. Part II in progress.

** I googled and read for an hour now, hoping to find something even remotely good.

There is nothing. The bits I found were clusterfucks of the highest order, in the best of cases.

*** Someone recently requested Giant Squid smut fics and got several responses. Also Lily/Harry. Cousins is kind of tame.

**** I didn't say it wasn't tame. I just commented that they're cousins. Though IMO the fact that she comes with a Draco is worse than them having the same grandparents...

** I remember reading two old stories with Sirius/Narcissa. One wasn't in English, and in the other one they were minor characters (Cassandra Clair's The Draco Trilogy). Sirius and Narcissa weren't first cousins in these stories though.
