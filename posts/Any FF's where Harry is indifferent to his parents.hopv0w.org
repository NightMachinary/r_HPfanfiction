Like he doesn't jump at everyone who insults them or isn't sad about their death because "why should I mourn someone I never knew and had no sentimental connection to?"


** I kinda remember a hilarious quote from assassins creed games. When asked to surrender or else her kids will die, the lady lifts her skirt up, and exclaims. "Kill them. I have the instrument to make more of them!"

  AU. Harry was born with a power the Dark Lord knows not: the magic to see into shadows, to walk the shadows, and to send the shadows everywhere. This changes his life rather dramatically.

  What if that night in Godric's Hollow went differently? What if Harry did die? What if Death stepped in and made a deal with the Savior of the Wizarding World? How different would Harry's life be after that deal?(Or, Harry makes a deal with Death and in exchange gains something Voldemort has fought his entire life for. Immortality. And a strange friendship with Death)

** Well, this sort of happens in /Harry Potter and the Iron Lady./

Harry has no connection to Lily and James, but he's fiercely defensive of his ties to his adoptive parents.

  Even muggles notice thousands dead, and Margaret Thatcher had the help of one Sergeant Prewett of Her Majesty's Special Air Service. Harry Potter is taken in by a loving family, and raised to become the hero of both worlds. Even as he enters Hogwarts looking for friends, he is confronted by the darkness in the wizarding world. Now complete! Sequel: Nymphadora Tonks: The Last Auror.
