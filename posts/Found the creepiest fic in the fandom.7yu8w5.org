** What about the one where Krum rapes Hermione and then Harry has to "fix her" by having sex with her?

Or the one where Umbridge doses the entire DA with Lust positions and have them gangrape Hermione?

**** Yeah, I read through it, hoping for some plot twist like someone stabbing Umbridge or her getting the Centaur treatment in return. Nada, nothing.

*** The second reminds me of Stephen King's "It." And not in a way that's positive.

  Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see. Harry Potter and the Cthulhu Mythos clash.

** OK, if you really want a creepy fic, no other is creepier, disgusting and inhumane than this. I regret even reading the first line of this. So, be warned. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6129388]]
