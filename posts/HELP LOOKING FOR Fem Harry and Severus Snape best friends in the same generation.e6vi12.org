:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for a fanfic I read a while back. Basically Harry and Severus meet as toddlers after his mum Eileen leaves him with James and fem harry while she goes to sort some things out.

James gets Jealous that his daughter's attention is no longer on him and hates baby Severus and tries To keep her away from Sev who is not her best friend.

Later they go as dates for the Yule ball and share their first kiss.

So - Fem harry and Sev meet as Toddlers - James and Lily alive - Overprotective father James who does not like Severus

Edit: If I remember correctly I think there was one character that attends Hogwarts the same time as them that seemed like he would have been in the 70s in canon. He flirts with "Harry" at the ball tries to kiss/grope her and gets punched for it by Severus. Who later gets approval from James and he shares a dance with "Harry" at the ball and they kiss.


** Dose that mean that snape was born 20 years later?
