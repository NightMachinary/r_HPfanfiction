I'm trying to find a specific fic I read years ago, in which Harry, Ron, and Hermione meet each other on the train and somehow decide/convince each other/make a pact that they should all try to get sorted into Slytherin. It only covered the first night, so the train and the sorting and so on. There was a bit where Hermione was arguing with the Hat?

It's not "A sky far far away", in fact I'm pretty sure it was a oneshot? (it's been years though, what do I know)


** I couldn't find the story you're looking for with a quick search, but here's a couple of stories that feature the three of them in Slytherin.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8779343/1/The-Silver-Trio][The Silver Trio]] by Kyong Kybis. In this one, the Sorting Hat convinces them all to go to Slytherin.

I've never read it, so I couldn't tell you if it's particularly good.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2725123/1/Silver_Trio][Here's]] an older story by the same name, but it's also not a one-shot.

Most of the other results were just one of them in Slytherin, or weird blogs where people gush about how perfect the three of them are at fulfilling House roles or something.

Good luck finding the story you're looking for.

*** No, it wasn't those either. Probably should have added that into the original post, as those three were the only fics I could find when I tried searching myself.

The reason I mention 'Sky' is because I feel like it was in the AN of this fic as inspiration? Perhaps not, though. I am as sure as I can be, though, that the fic began on the train. Like, after Draco left, Harry and Ron talked, and then Hermione joined them a few paragraphs in.

It'd be just my luck if it got deleted or something.

*** No, sorry.

The fic I had in mind is a very old fic, and it involved the Trio coming to the conclusion that their best bet was for all three of them, together, to get into Slytherin. No adult POVs, nothing past the First Night (so no troll).

**** It actually does go into the planning on the train after the sorting. We get a sort of flashback to that decision

*** /shrugs/ This is part of the reason I want to find it again. Offhand, I suspect it's less "because he fits" and more "let's the three of us do this thing together", along with a smattering of "I want to outshine my brothers" which is PS canon and a type of ambition, even if Ron doesn't do much during the series to actually achieve it.
