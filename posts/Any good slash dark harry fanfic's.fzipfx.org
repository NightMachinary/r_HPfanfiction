** 0 points (50% upvoted), why exactly? I'd recommend Darkly Loyal, though it's not strictly slash. The pairing is Harry/Draco/Hermione. It's a genuinely good read, imo.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

** Tom Riddle/HP

A brilliant fic. So much Worldbuilding in terms of dark magicand Horcruxes. It's very good and interesting. Tom Riddle pov. So not a lot of Dark!Harry that you see but I highly rec it. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16497056]])

A dark Harry fic with a twist. I absolutely love it. I wish there was a sequel. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6006037]])

This is one of the best Tomarry fics I ever read. Ending with a twist. Basically what if Harry acted like a Horcrux in Tom Riddles mind. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11244426]])

Very interesting. Not reall Dark Harry though. Harry gets trapped in a memory inside Dumbledores pensieve. He changes timelines. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/995179]])

This is a Wolfstar not a Harry fic but I highly rec it anyways. The whole series is so well done. Angsty with a hopeful ending. Linkao3(Howl by Shiftylinguini)

This is a WIP Linkao3(The Master of Death by Quine)

  In limbo, Harry doesn't choose to go back to the Forbidden Forest to face Voldemort. He makes another decision and finds himself in a baby's body: little Tom Riddle. Years pass and intimately bind the orphan and his imaginary friend, in a hopeless and incestuous relationship. Indeed, all the odd events of Tom Riddle's life happen in spite of Harry's presence: could he be the one who provokes them?This is Tom Riddle's entire life, as close to canon as possible, if he shared his body with Harry Potter (and fell in love with him).

  “Don't talk about her,” he snarls, and Sirius knows what will happen from here. He likes to bait Remus, snark that it isn't the wolf but him that comes crawling to Sirius every moon, but he knows it's only partly true. There's an animal there, just under the surface, an animal with a man's desires. He can hear it in the way Remus can't catch his breath, feel it in the way he leans down to run his open mouth over Sirius's neck, inhaling his scent.

  "I can't go back, can I?“ Harry asked after a while."Do you want to?“ Death asked instead of answering. Harry stayed quiet."I could choose to go on,“ he said after some time."You could,“ Death replied and paused for a moment. Then he started to talk again. “But there is something you want more than that, don't you?”“What do you mean?” Harry asked as he let his hands wander over the back of a bench."A second chance,“ Death said. Harry stopped and turned around to look at the being. “I cannot simply bring back the dead. But If you were my Master, I could bring you back to the dead." Twenty-four-year old Harry Potter feels like something is missing in his life. When Death offers him a second chance, he takes it.Accompanied by the being, Harry travels back to the summer before Sirius dies. Inside his younger body and the memories of an older self, Harry realizes, that being connected to Death may have twisted his morals a little more than expected.And while the Ministry could use a change; this time he won't let himself being used in this war. Neither by Dumbledore nor anyone else.
