** Hmm...not quite "best" but they do get along very well (better than canon) in Nightmares of Futures Past. Currently the best source for it is [[https://github.com/IntermittentlyRupert/hpnofp-ebook/releases/][the eBook]] (includes PDF).

**** It's one of the early Peggy Sue fics, where the war dragged on for thirteen years until almost everyone was dead, and after killing Voldemort, Harry had nothing left - so he and Dumbledore's portrait invented a method to send his spirit back in time to when he was 11.

It has a great balance between foreknowledge and the butterfly effect, and a strong emphasis on Harry building up his friends and preparing them for what's to come. It's unfortunately incomplete, though technically not abandoned, updating about every three years (the author has serious health trouble).

Official summary:

#+begin_quote
  The war is over. Too bad no one is left to celebrate. Harry makes a desperate plan to go back in time, even though it means returning Voldemort to life. Now an 11 year old Harry with 30 year old memories is starting Hogwarts. Can he get it right?

** I did a little research and that's what I found, but beware I didn't read them so I don't really know what they are about, just that harry and the twins are friends in these ones.

  Harry ends up sharing a compartment with Fred, George and Lee on the train, instead of Ron. Harry gains new friends on the ride to Hogwarts. Rating may change later.

  (Re-Posted!) What if Harry Potter met Fred and George Weasley years before he found out he was a wizard? What if they didn't know he was Harry Potter until they helped him on Platform Nine and 3/4? How would Harry's first year at Hogwarts go with his best friends who were infamous third-year pranksters? Well, read and find out! First Book-UA. (No pairings in this book!)

  The watchful eyes of the adoring public are locked on to the girl-who-lived-to-be-frustrated-by-society rather than where they ought to be: on her scheming twin brother. Slytherin!Harry, no Potter favoritism, no particular romance, HIATUS, but being worked on as of 2-1-16

  The first thing everyone noticed about Hope Potter was that she may have had her mother's face, but she had her father's penchant for causing trouble or somehow finding it, and it only made sense that danger was attracted to her very scent. She was going to prove she was more than just the Girl-Who-Lived. (Fem!Harry) Mostly canon-compliant, diverging in book eight
