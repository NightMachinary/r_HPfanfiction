I have read many stories where Harry writes for newspaper, but is there any story where he creates a newspaper company. For example, he buys a building in Diagon or Knockturn alley, hire wizards and witches also squibs who is working as a journalist in muggle world. The newspaper competes with the other Newspaper providing accurate news. Something like this.


** The series starting with "Harry Potter and the Vault of Time" linkffn(13315643) has Harry founding an alternative newspaper to the Daily Prophet. It takes a while to reach that point.

linkffn(11602420) I've not actually read it but I believe this story fits too.

  One tiny change makes all the difference in the world. When Harry discovers a small box in his vault during his first visit to Gringotts, he is hoping for a memento of his parents. Instead, his discovery starts him down a path of intrigue and suspicion. Not sure who he can trust, Harry will have to learn to rely on himself. Book 1 of The Cry of Freedom. Updates every Tuesday.

** Well, it's not primarily Harry, but a wartime newspaper is launched in the Revolutionary Arc to compete with Daily Prophet propaganda. You really need to have read at least the first three books of the Pureblood Pretense series first, though, which is nearly a million words, and then Revolutionary Arc is another million.

  Alexander Willoughby is not entirely human. Some would say he is entirely inhuman, but it is with an entirely human sense of curiosity that he sits down beside Aldon Rosier in their very first Magical Theory class. (Liar Liar)
