I'd love some recommendations of fics in which Hermione is wrongly accused of being a traitor (or any similar storyline).

Long, complete fics with any pairing would be awesome if possible (though non-Ron/Hermione are preferred).

Thanks in advance!


** ffnlink(Kiss of the Traitor) is one I really liked and sounds like exactly what you're looking for.

  “Hello, Hermione,” he said from the shadows. She froze. He watched the colour drain from her face. “No...” she whispered. He was a living nightmare... And that broke his heart.

  After a humiliating incident, Hermione ponders the nature of trust. Trust is a curious thing. It's like a window, fragile and easily shattered, but as long as the frame still stands it can be fixed and made stronger than ever. HHr
