:END:
Hey everyone!

I am looking for a fic where Harry makes a deal with Voldemort at the end of first year. He gives him the stone, if the voldemort rescues him from the Dursleys. And Voldemort actually rescues him a few weeks into the summer holidays.

I dont remember much more though.

Thanks you all! :)


** Maybe Contractual Obligations on ff.n (or ao3 come to think of it) by witchlips

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12610948/1/][the same as above but on ff.n]]

Not what you were looking for but also called contractual obligations

The top one is one of my favorite slightly crackedy fics

  What if Harry wasn't the Savior they thought? What if he just honestly didn't care about the light? Horcruxes. Dumbledore/granger/molly/ron/ginny bashing. implied slash.
