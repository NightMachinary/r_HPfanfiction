  What if Harry's friends tried to help him out in getting a date to the Yule Ball and he suddenly found himself with too many dates? Hilarity and romance ensues of course. Harry/Multi and eventual harem.

#+begin_quote
  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.
