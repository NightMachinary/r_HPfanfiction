Too many fics have a Voldemort who sits around on a throne torturing his own followers for failures all while doing nothing himself unless the occasion is dramatic enough. Linkffn(I Am Lord Voldemort) Is a good example where he isn't afraid to get his hands dirty. Are there more fics like this?

#+begin_quote
  A genre savvy but ignorant of canon OC insert into Voldemort right after the murder of James Potter. Greed replacing pride at the helm of a terrorist group just might change the course of history. After all, the magical world is full of potential waiting to be exploited. (Inspired by The Evil Overlord List and 48 Laws of Power.)
