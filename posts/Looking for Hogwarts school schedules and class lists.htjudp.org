Hi there. I think I've seen somewhere that people have timetabled which days Harry and co have their lessons each year, and also made up lists of which Hogwarts students are in each year. I've been looking on Harry Potter wiki but haven't been able to find these. Does anyone have a link to either of them? Thanks.


** Is something like this what you're looking for?

** My only issue with the pre-year-six timetables is the fact that it's implied that there are no free periods in those days (i.e. Ron's super excited to finally be getting some free periods in book six).

How in the world does the staff keep up with such a schedule when it seems that they don't have Time-Turners? It's implied that the entire stock was destroyed in the Dept of Mysteries.

Common sense would be for fanon to include no more than two of the same lessons per house, per subject, per week (e.g. no more than two Transfiguration sessions for the Gryffindors per week) as well as giving the first to fifth-years free periods here and there to balance the staff's schedule.

Also, from what we know, some classes are joint sessions, which eases the pressure off the staff.

- Potions: Gryffindor + Slytherin, so therefore Ravenclaw + Hufflepuff as well.

- Care of Magical Creatures, as above.

- Not Divination, most likely.

- Herbology: Gryffindor + Hufflepuff, so therefore Ravenclaw + Slytherin as well.

- Probably not History of Magic, or Defence Against the Dark Arts.

- Astronomy unknown, but probably not joint.

- Muggle Studies might be a joint session, as Ernie Macmillan mentioned seeing Hermione there.

- Unsure about Arithmancy.

- Transfiguration is most likely just one house at a time.

- Not Charms (as we never hear of anyone but the Gryffindors when Harry's in there, I think).

- Flying Lessons (first year only): similar to Potions.

- Unsure of Study of Ancient Runes.

Hope this helps in case you decide to draw up your own timetables, otherwise, feel free to search the HP lexicon for timetable info. They seem to have a schedule of sorts available for year 4 (it's incomplete) at least.
