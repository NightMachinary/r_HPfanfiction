I was recently rereading CoS (Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets) and, while reading chapter 18 "Dobby's Reward", this question came into my head: what if Harry never told Dumbledore that Ginny was the one to open the Chamber of Secrets? Now this change a bit the story and exact events of said Chapter but i think the evenst would go like this.

Following their escape from the undergrounds of Hogwarts, Harry doesnt tell Dumbledore that Ginny was the one to open the Chamber of Secrets, but instead tells that she was simply abducted by the monster and not possesed by Tom Riddle's diary and forced to open the Chamber. Now i think Dumbledore would still know the truth as he said himself, in chapter 37 "The Lost Prophecy" of The Order of the Phoenix, that he is a quite skilled Legilimes, so i think he would have just "looked" in the mind of Harry without him knowing. This way Dumbledore would still be able to come the same conclusions he did in the book. I also think that Dumbledore wouldn't have confronted Harry with the fact that he lied but kept the secret.

Harry not telling that Ginny had been controlled by the diary would have saved her from her "public humiliation" that she got in the form of her father, Arthur Weasley, yelling at her that she had leard nothing from him, that she never has to trust something that thinks for itself when you dont see were it keeps it's brain. You might think that this would take away the life lesson but i dont think that she would have ever trusted something like that again, since she hasn't even forgot it in OotP, circa 3 years later.

The fact that Harry didn't tell the truth about Ginny, in my opinion, would make their bond even better. I think they would have an extra toppic to talk about while their dating in the Half-Blood Prince and i think that Harry would ask to talk with her during the events of OotP, as she is the only one that has been possesed by Voldemort he knows, where he thinks he is being possesed by the Dark Lord. This, i think, would create some interesting scenes with Harry and Ginny setting up their friendship and their future relationship even better.

Also, any kind of experience together, in this case the events of CoS and their shared secret, creates a very strong bond between people, connecting Harry and Ginny, not only thruogh a relationship, but also on deper level.

We could also have some more scenes of them both talking and supporting each other as friends in difficult moments such as the first task of the Triwizard Tournament, during which Ron wasn't talking to Harry, or during the already mentiond events of OofP.

This shared secret, i think, would have made her more timid and unsecure and even less secure about herself around him, due to the fact that only he knew this secret, something she would only overcome during their long talks and conversations about being possesed by Voldermort during Harry's fifth year.

To be clear, Hinny (Harry-Ginny) is really good, one of my favourites, but this would have added something more to an already great story line/arc

P.S. Let me know what you think of this question/theory and sorry if i am not always super clear, but english isn't my first language.


** Ginny was not humiliated in public if her father yelled at her in Dumbledore's office. She wasn't forced to wear a hat which read idiot or anything like that.

Now I get where you are coming from, but IMO it'd be way better if they bonded over you trauma (eg Ginny feels like Harry is the only one who understands since he was the only one down there) rather than about a pretty insignificant secret (since again, all she got was a dressing down).

** I am sorry, but I have a very strong dislike for this idea, for several reasons:

1. *Why would Harry lie?*\\
   At that point in the story (end of CoS), Harry doesn't really like Ginny. He only "knows" her because she is his best friend's little sister, and because she is one of "the annoying fan" like Creevey. In contrast, Harry has a lot of respect for Dumbledore, and is very grateful toward Arthur and Molly, who welcomed him the last summer. So why would Harry lie to them?\\
   All in all, Harry is a pretty honest kid. It's not to say that he never lie, but he has generally a good reason to do so (like saving people). There is always the "/Ginny is ashamed just like I was when Dumbledore asked me if I had anything to say to him and I didn't mention the voice in the wall/", but it sound like a weak argument, especially if it's to lie to people like Dumbledore and the Weasleys.

2. *If Ginny is just another victim, then who is the Heir?*\\
   In this particular case, the truth is great because it explains who opened the Chamber (Ginny), while making her another victim of the Heir (she was unwillingly possessed by a Dark Artifact). If Harry lie and say Ginny was only "abducted" by the Heir, then who opened the Chamber in the First Place? Dumbledore may learn the truth via legilimency, but other can't and Dumbledore still need to create a believable story.\\
   Without the presence of Ginny as the "unwilling Heir", then Harry, as the only known Parselmouth of the school, is the N°1 suspect. For outsider, the story would sound a lot like Harry was the Heir who got cold feet after aducting a student, and who was protected by Dumbledore. I doubt this kind of reputation would be helpul in the later years, especially the 5th.

3. *Why should Ginny not be scolded by her father?*\\
   You called Ginny being scolded by her father a "public humiliation", but is it really?\\
   Only 8 person are in the room when Arthur scolded Ginny, and if you exclude the Weasleys it leaves Harry (who knew everything), Dumbledore (the Headmaster), McGonagall (Deputy Headmaster and her head of House) and Lockart (irrevelant since he lost his mind after a botched memory charm). That's not a lot of people for a public humiliation, especially since most of them are were totally in their right to be present at that time.\\
   Also, why wouldn't Arthur scold her? If Arthur said "/What have I always told you? Never trust anything that can think for itself if you can't see where it keeps its brain?/", it means that Ginny actions during the year were extremely stupid from the point of view of a wizard, equivalent to a Muggle child putting his finder in a power plug. By all means she should have died, and it's only by miracle that Harry saved her, being scold for a fautl "she did" is not a heavy price to pay in comparaison. Especially since Ginny is not all white in this story. She "learnt" pretty quickly that the Diary was Dark, and that she was at least partially responsible for the opening of the Chamber, and yet she did, or said, nothing. Her actions during the year were enough to have her expelled, or even put in a trial. And yet she was only lightly scold by her father, and Dumbledore never gave any punishment to her, or even revealed her part in the story, she got an extremely lenient punishment.

4. *Would it be really good for Ginny?*\\
   Let's say that Harry does lie the Weasleys, that nobody know Ginny involvement in the story, and even that Dumbledore does find a story to clear Harry, would it really be beneficial for Ginny?\\
   First of all, I'm pretty sure that you do not care for "/a poor girl that was abducted but quickly saved/" the same way you do for "/a girl that spent most of her year possessed by the spirit of Voldemort who used her to try to purge the school from Muggleborns by opening the Chamber of Secrets/". Lying to the Weasleys would rob them from any chance to heal their child, since they would not know what is wrong in the first place.\\
   Lying would also mean that Ginny would have to lie with the guilt of not only helping Voldemort, but also lying to her parents, and everyone. I'm sure it would do wonders for her emotional growth. Just like "Harry is the only one who can reveal my darkest secret" would do wonder for her relation with him.

​

In the end, it sound like this idea would create a lot of problems in canon, just to create one or two scenes between Ginny and Harry, and it doesn't seem to be a good deal for me.\\
But it's fanfictions so people are always free to do what they want. I also think that's it may be a pretty good subplot for a "Cunning Harry fic". Where Harry doesn't have any trouble lying, is less suspected by the public and doesn't really care if this lie would fuck up Ginny emotionally. Not being friend with Ron or indebted to his parents would also probably help.
