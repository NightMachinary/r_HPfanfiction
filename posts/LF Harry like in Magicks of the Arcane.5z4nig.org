Looking for like I've written in the title, a Harry Potter like he's portrayed in Magicks of the Arcane.

I love how he interacted with multiple woman and the relationship he had with Dumbledore.


** I saw the title and thought you were talking about [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8527691/8/An-Incomplete-Potter-Collection][a Harry Potter/Magicka crossover I read once]].

That's a Harry I'd like to see more of, for sure...

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

** So people don't have to read the fic in order to help you, what's Harry like in the story?

How did he react with the women and what was his relationship like with Dumbledore? What was the basic plot structure?

Also if you reference a fic, please make sure you either provide a link to the story, or use the bot: linkffn(8303194).

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand, the incentive to survive. And thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

*** He slept with a lot of women and was a player who liked getting an eyeful. Pretty standard wish fulfillment.
