Harry Potter is a big world, and it has a lot of people in it. However, many of these are in ffnet's character list but not in many, or even any, stories. These characters are needlessly causing clutter. Why are they there?

According to a quick check of the app, there are characters such as "Karkaroff's Aide", with five stories, and "Apollyon Pringle" with one. One story out of several hundred thousand. Why do these characters need to be on the character list?

I think this is you imagining a problem rather than there being a problem in reality

** Not sure if anyone else is going to reply but the answer is becuase the author created that character and tag. Hermone is a meme for a reason, things are calm now but yeah just be happy ffnet exists at all and don't worry about other authors work so much.

**** Glad I could provide an answer for you and sorry if I came off a bit snappy in my reply. Tired af yesterday with a high fever so I couldn't even sleep it off. Feeling better and looking back I was not a happy camper yesterday ðŸ˜‚.

Yes though when you publish something you can use a name tag or add one. So if I wanted to use President Trump or Governor Schwarzenegger that could be done. Now I want to make a Muscle Wizard crack fic with Schwarzenegger being a godlike wizard ðŸ˜‚

***** And that explains why there are so many characters; it's because HP is such a large fandom.
