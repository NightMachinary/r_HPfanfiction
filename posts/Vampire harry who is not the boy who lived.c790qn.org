:END:
There was this fic which I read a year or so ago

Harry is not the boy who lived .. Neville is ..and he is also best friends with Hermiones and Ron... I believe the fic starts in 6th year... Hermione suddenly notices Harry and the tri wonder how they haven't known him through he is from their house....

Harry is a vampire in this fic...

There were no pairings and I remember one of Harry's ancestors a woman is also a vampire and she is out to get Harry

  Alternate Universe. Neville is the Boy Who Lived. So what does that make Harry Potter? Just a shy unpopular kid right? No, nobody could have imagined just how wrong they were. Secrets and Lies, Truth and Protection. Welcome to the War.
