We've all read our fair share of abandoned or slow to update fics. Some of them we don't think too much on because they're entertaining, but maybe nothing special (which, to be fair, can sometimes be exactly what you're looking for!) but other times, you stumble across an incomplete fic that is absolutely outstanding and it's such a shame that it's unfinished. In a community of fan authors, I imagine that the idea of writing fic about a fic has crossed many minds. Have you ever written or read something like that? Did it hold up (well enough) to the ‘original'? What's your stance on meta-fic?

Personally I think that it's amazing that something fan-made can take on a life of its own in a similar fashion to an original work, but I'm undecided about how I feel about the appropriateness of it. On the one hand, I think that creativity knows no bounds and if you're inspired by a fic enough to create something of your own about it, it would be appropriate to reach out and ask the original fic author if they're okay with it. We're all peers here, after all. On the other hand, I imagine some people feel protective of their work (naturally), and they may not be amenable to sharing with another creator. What's your stance on it in this circumstance? As an author, would you prefer that another person create a fic about your fic, or create something ‘original' even if there are striking similarities?

Lastly, if you've ever stumbled across a meta-fic, please share it!


** As long as you credit the original author of the fanfic, I don't see any problem with it.

I don't even think you need permission. Sure, asking for permission is nice, but most fanfic authors didn't ask the original creator for permission either. In my opinion, it would be a bit ironic if a fanfic author wasn't okay with fanfiction to their work.

** I haven't seen it much anymore, but back in the day, you would see fics with summaries saying they are abandoned and you can adopt them. Sometimes they got finished that way! But like I said, I never see that anymore.

** I've seen fanfics of finished works, and that was super neat. I'm also super bad at finishing works, so if anyone wanted to pick up the torch I'd probably let them. I've also wanted to read fanfic of fanfic, and I feel like an 'inspired by' fic would be amazing in a lot of cases. Something that takes place in the same universe is mostly what I find myself wanting.

As an author and reader I'd love them, but it depends on the person.

** I think it's important to give authors their due and I could maybe see using the idea of a fic but not continue where it left off without permission if it isn't finished.

*** So...you don't approve of how many authors wrote their own versions of books six and seven before those were actually released, then?

I mean, I guess you can say that JKR gave blanket permission for people to write fanfic, but then it hardly makes sense to say that those authors can in turn forbid fanfic of their fanfic.

** This is called recursive fanfiction, and is generally considered a compliment. However, you may wish to ask the author if you can use their characters/AU/whatever first, since some take a dim view of others using what they made (because irony is hard to understand).

Continuing fanfictions, particularly dead/abandoned ones, is a slightly more difficult topic, but if you ask first, and either get a 'yes' or no reply at all, then there's no real reason not to give it a try.

** Anyone who gets mad that you've made a fanfiction of their own story has an extreme double standard going. I don't even think you need to ask permission. Just tell the reader's point blank about the original work. If you're feeling generous, then send them a notification about what you're doing and send them a link. If they tell you that you can't do it, then laugh in their face and go for it anyways.

** There are two (authorised) one-shots by different authors, giving more background to Nightmares of Futures Past.

Generally I like the idea as a reader. If I were authoring...I think that I would like reading fanfics so long as the authors demonstrated that they had really read and understood what I wrote.
