I admit, this is a very general question and not strictly related to Harry Potter fanfiction, but it has happened quite frequently when I was browsing [[https://FF.net][FF.net]], that I came upon comments/reviews not only on my own but on other fictions too, about the length of paragraphs.

When has it become fashion to cut away a story telling, making it into parts in favor of the inability of people to follow a string of thought? I don't understand this attitude towards lengthy paragraphs, or even one-paragraph tellings that keep with one narrator, going through a story hand in hand, reader and author.

Could someone enlighten me? Are not books quite often written with lengthy paragraphs? I have, if I remember correctly, yet to come upon a book that was as fragmented with lines inbetween sentences much like most fanfictions are written.

All the best.


** I personally don't have a problem with it, but I've seen people say it is hard to keep up with paragraphs that are 6+ lines on a computer screen. Nothing to do with your actual writing style or anything. I try to keep my paragraphs to be max 4 lines on fanfiction.net. One problem with my writing I had to solve early on was not lumping together dialogue between two people into one paragraph. Always a new line when a different person starts talking.

*** Indeed? Then it would seem the culprit is the computer screen. Free Tablets for all, I say! (But not from me, I am a poor fellow.)

I admit I find myself easily frustrated when people seem incapable of reading simple paragraphs of maybe twenty to thirty lines, because that yet is nothing much, - but when through the formatting/the display, these paragraphs suddenly are stretched or compressed, it may truly become hard to read.

***** Yeah, a computer screen can easily fit an A4 page worth of content. On a tablet, it would be impossible to read. I mean, I have a 27 inch monitor and a 10 inch tablet with the same resolution. What is easy to read on a monitor would be very bad on a tablet, especially since you control it with your fingers instead of a mouse with thousands of DPI.

** A large paragraph can automatically make someone start skimming. You want to avoid that. Lots of people also read on phones, and when the paragraph covers the majority of their screen, it's a bit much.

And you're not cutting away story telling. Breaking up paragraphs doesn't mean ruining the flow. Don't just break them up randomly. See which parts can be split. Part of being a good writer is watching out for these things.

Paragraph control also isn't something you should learn just for easy reading. Certain sentences may stand out and hit harder if they're not part of a huge paragraph. Just like sentences, you want to vary their length.

You said in another comment you become frustrated when people don't want to read 20-30 lines. Honestly, 20 lines is already pushing it a bit. 30 is definitely too much. 30 lines covers up most of my screen, and most of a book page as well.

Take a look at a book you have and find the biggest paragraph you can, then count the lines. I just did and I couldn't find a single one that was 20. This entire comment was 20 lines and yet I broke it up for easier reading.

*** There are some rules I have found being used in the most books I have read, and they are that only one person is to speak per line, and that a train of thought is to be continued and not to be broken apart by creating artificial paragraphs.

Hah, I say, and I just have to take Demian from my nightstand, randomly open any page and there I have it, one wall of text filling a page or two, sometimes even more because it's all connected in a train of thoughts that musn't be cut open.

But I understand what you are trying to say. Still, these comments/reviews that give critique to the author as if it was the authors fault that the reader can't comprehend what his own eyes are reading, they seem unfair to me.

Well, no matter. Thank you for the reply.

**** I think you're a bit exaggerating what a new paragraph does. You can have the same train of thought separated if it goes on long enough. A new paragraph doesn't break it up to such an extent that it's going to be jarring or confuse the reader. You can take a paragraph that's 20 lines and of the same train of thought and split it two or even three and it would likely be perfectly fine.

It's your job as a writer to make your work readable. Some people have trouble reading large paragraphs because it's just a big block of text and if the reader finds themselves bored with the first sentence, it becomes ever more likely they'll skim the rest of the paragraph. It's not an uncommon thing to not want large paragraphs.

This is one step away from blaming the reader for not enjoying incorrect grammar.

Post a 30 line paragraph of yours and I'll be very surprised if I can't break it into two in a natural way.

***** I do not. Paragraphs have a proper structure and meaning. They close off topics from one-another. That's how I have learned it to be. Now, when a character is building an empire in the clouds, do I interrupt it in favor of creating a paragraph, or do I continue the explanation that is coherent and momentous? I create a paragraph once this topic is wholly done and over, don't I?

I disagree. It is the authors job to build the labyrinth and it's the readers job to navigate together, with the author, through it. It's a joint adventure. If people are having trouble reading long paragraphs because they are unable to comprehend the content, (if it is well-written, of course) then it is not the authors fault but the readers, and either the reader must seek different readingmaterial or learn to read properly. Certain authors take longer to get used to, certainly, but that doesn't mean their work is any less good or right, and it certainly doesn't mean that their way of writing is wrong.

Grammar, now that is a matter altogether different from paragraphs.

But I can agree with Boris_The_Unbeliever, who wrote that indeed paragraphs and their use have changed over time. [See his post for details].

No, I'd rather not see you break apart the paragraphs I have so carefully crafted into existence, I am quite attached to them how they are. Thank you for the offer though.

****** But you are. You're taking too seriously the supposed interruption a new paragraph brings to a train of thought. They /can/ close off topics, but they don't need to. You can have the same train of thought going on for several paragraphs and there would be nothing wrong with it. You're not going to interrupt the building of an empire in the clouds by creating a new paragraph.

You can certainly overdo the amount of paragraphs you have in a single line of thought, but you can also overdo the amount of lines you have in a single paragraph. There's a middle ground the readers should find, and if your paragraphs are so frequently large that they feel the need to mention it, you're probably not finding this middle ground.

It's all subjective, isn't it? You have a limit, too. You'd certainly find a paragraph with 60 lines far too much, wouldn't you? You can handle paragraphs of 30 lines, and that's fine, but the average reader, especially in this day and age as Boris_The_Unbelievable pointed out, will not find it tolerable.

#+end_quote

Not if your paragraph is stretching beyond what your average reader would find manageable. If you're into the 20s in terms of lines, it's time to break it up. You don't have to start a new paragraph right there. You don't have to cut it right in the middle. It may take some rewording, cutting a sentence or two from the beginning or end, but it should be done for the sake of your reader.

It's not about being unable to comprehend the content. I'm sure your readers can understand what you've written just fine. It's about them losing steam as they delve deeper and deeper into an overwhelming block of text. It's about them wanting that split second long break, which is no more of an interruption than someone taking a quick breath in a speech; yes, technically, it /is/ an interruption, but you can hop right back into the same train of thought without any problem whatsoever, and to suggest otherwise is an insult to the reader.

** Well I tend to break up my paragraphs in my stories BECAUSE on Fanfic.net and on Notepad files they look really bad if the paragraphs are too long! "Wall of text" the phrase is.

But I see where your idea and argument comes from, indeed the fact that at least on [[https://FF.net][FF.net]], (as it is the only page I have a reference to) the width of the website's design makes it hard to calculate just how big these paragraphs look like.

**** Paragraphs are ways to organize words and ideas.

Generally, a natural break occurs when 1) the action or dialogue belongs to a different character ( a change in perspective) 2) there is a difference in theme / idea (such as internal monologues) 3) there is a shift in tone, focus, or thought 4) there is a choice to emphasize 5) there is a significant shift in setting

Done properly, there are very few cases where an extremely long paragraph is warranted, and certainly never one I've seen in fanfiction.

** In addition to answers of computer screens and efficient paragraph breaks, there is the fact that literature has changed. The age of long paragraphs, of sentences and strings of thought that lasted pages, is gone. This was popular in the 17, 18 and 19 centuries, because very flowery language was used. Writing was embellished, and that was taken as a sign of beauty and intelligence. Now, most writing courses and universities teach concision. Why use 10 words when you can one?

This is then exacerbated by our culture of instant gratification, where something funny or exciting (like a cat meme) is literally at the fingertips, seconds away. In order to grab a reader's attention, story-telling needs to adapt to this format, providing a narrative that is quick, digestible, and fun.

** For myself, Fanficion.net has terrible spacing between lines, so when authors use large paragraphs it makes it a pain to read. It gets worse if I'm reading on a phone. I admit there have been otherwise decent fics that I didn't follow up on simply because the author used long paragraphs and it was painful on the eyes for me. Ao3 didn't have this issue so much for me because the spacing between lines was larger than on fanfic net.

** Digital publishing standards are different to those in hard copy. This is not limited to fanfiction, you see it in professionally produced e-books too.

The digital convention is that paragraphs are not indented as they are in hard copy. That means that the reader needs a different way of breaking up text, which has become the line break.

With neither indents or line breaks you are essentially writing without paragraphs, which is incorrect English.

** I personally don't like them. Don't get me wrong, I can follow, and understand with the best of them, but I don't see the point. It's firstly more visually appealing to the reader. Secondly, it's not something I believe a skilled writer should find difficult to do. Thirdly, it allows seperation of thoughts, dialogue, and such. Lastly, even if this one character is having this 40+ line thought, you're able to seperate it. In my opinion, the mark of a good writer is to be able to know when, and how to seperate paragraphs.

Honest question, give me a 10+ line paragraph, and I guarantee i'll be able to seperate it in a natural way without it losing the flow, or impact. Take me up on this challenge if you dare, but if your putting your writing out there, it means you want people to see it. It's your job to make sure they get the best experience out of it. If you don't care what people truly think, you wouldn't share it in the first place. Simple as that.

** It would depend on the story and author.

I've seen plenty of authors that write long paragraphs filled with nothing, like, I get it, your story-your style-your whatever but I really won't even try to read a wall of text, not even counting authors that put dialogues mid- paragraph making even more of a mess.

If I was a writer I would take those ''long paragraphs'' and shorten them as much as I could, that way you can make sure you are actually transmitting you message across to the reader instead of just inflating the word count by writing in an extra flowery way :B

​

Also, it's been said already but screens aren't fully compatible to reading, for example to read on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] I have to zoom in 80% while on reddit that would be 10%.
