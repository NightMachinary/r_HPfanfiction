I have at least 15 tags I always sort out but it's annoying and tedious.


** Not that I'm aware of.

What I've found to be helpful is excluding all the tags I don't want, then bookmarking that tab on my bookmarks bar. Anytime I want to look for a new fic, I just simply click the bookmark and add specific tags I'm looking for at the moment.

I hope this makes sense. I haven't slept in 20+ hours, and I'm a bit out of it, lol.

** There is a JavaScript addon through greasemonkey etc. that allows you to blacklist tags and do a few other things on ao3.
