*** Harry/Ron is a rare pairing, but I think it's a really good ship, especially considering the books!

** I'm guessing it's Snape/Hermione for me, even though I can't stand that pairing anymore. That was waaaay back in mid-late 2000's. I've grown out of the ship since then.

Other ships I've read a lot were Fred/Hermione, Tom/Hermione, Salazar/Hermione.

But these days, I mostly read gen.

I wish I could include it, however it wouldn't allow me to add any more options for some reason...

*** YEAAAAH! I love Harry/Luna.

For some reason, I always thought it was Huna, but apparently it's Larry.

Shrug.

** Golden Trio OT3 for me.

I also enjoy the oh-so-rare Bill/Fleur/Tonks and Colin/Luna (which is harder to find than Bigfoot)

** Wow, Drarry and Harmony being second and third, behind literally every other ships combined. What a surprise.

After that they want to tell us this subreddit hates Drarry because we're homophobic or some shit, and we hate Harmony/Hermione for no reason.
