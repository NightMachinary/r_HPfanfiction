Hi, I was wondering if any authors on here would be interested in writing something based on the song Code Name: Raven by House of Heroes. ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O26qAjcBx8w]])

I figure it would be cool to see Harry during WWII and the War of Grindelwald, and this song is full of fun imagery. Plus Harry as a spy and raven animagus would be fun as heck.

It doesn't have to be much of anything. A one shot or something similar would be amazing. Just putting it out there I guess. :)
