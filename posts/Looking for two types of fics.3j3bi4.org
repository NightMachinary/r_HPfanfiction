Hello there !

I am looking for some new fics to read today, and basically there are two fields I am curious to explore :

- Fics where Flamel didn't die and is Harry's mentor.

I remember reading one once (with some hints at Harry/Fleur) but I 1) never found it again 2) never found any other one

- Fics where the protagonists are older, especially in the 20-30 range.

I am fine with teenagers being in love, but please don't make me believe that at 15 or 16 you were at the same time smart, confident, good looking, in love with your future wife, mature with enough experience to know anything in the world. Basically any fic where the main characters are in their twenties, discovering life, alcohol, relationships and the harsh reality while having fun. I don't really care about pairings (but if you want me to quote some, I am like many others a fan of Tonks / Fleur / Daphne / Pansy

Thank you :D


** In Echos Of Power linkffn(3322666) (uncompleted) Harry was trained by the Flamels but we don't get to see much of it, just some flashbacks. There's also linkffn(The Bonds of Blood) where Harry and Ginny get some traning from the Flamels but then again, we don't see a lot of them.

I can recommand linkffn(Homecoming) as a 20's fic where Harry gets back in England after the war and never went to Hogwarts. He gets to meet Ginny and lives with Tonks as a friend. Really interesting.

**** Echoes Of Power is uncomplete and unlikely to be one day though. Still a good read but keep that in mind if you want to read it!
