I tried checking the wikias and Pottermore for birth dates or order of birth but couldn't actually find a definitive answer. I wanted to start a fic in around the Marauder Era but wasn't sure what the possible age differences would be. If they were younger than Molly they could potentially still be at Hogwarts when the Marauders attended. Also, am I correct in assuming that there is no actual mention of them being pranksters? I can't tell if they are even twins outside of the hints that Fred and George were possibly initialed/named after them.


** In the books there are only four mentions of Fabian and three of Gideon. None of them specify that they're twins or their age relative to Molly:

...Gideon Prewett, it took five Death Eaters to kill him and his brother Fabian, they fought like heroes - book 5, ch 9

and Gideon Prewett, who had died like a hero, book 5, ch 9

...brutal murders of Gideon and Fabian Prewett. book 5, ch 24

it was actually my brother Fabian's and he wasn't terribly careful with his possessions, book 7, ch 7

He checked the battered old watch that had once been Fabian Prewett's. book 7, epilogue

** It has honestly never occurred to me that the Prewett twins might not, in fact, be twins. However, if they /are/ twins, then more than likely they're younger than Molly. Parents usually stop if their first children are twins (but that's not definitive, of course). In that case, they were probably born post-1950 and closer in age to the Black sisters than the Marauders.

*** Tell that to Molly and Arthur. They had an additional two kids following the twins.

**** I said with /first/ children. When you have additional children /before/ the twins, it matters less. The "singlets" are less likely to feel excluded from the bond most twins share. It also explains why Ginny was born at all - to give Ron a playmate. That often occurs if a singlet is born after the twins: the parents will have one more child so the singlet won't be so lonely.

I feel like it's really not for Weasleys.

**** Typically, if a single child is born /after/ a set of twins, then parents will have another child so the other one isn't so lonely (Ron+Ginny are an example of this). So, as I said, if Fabian and Gideon are twins then /more than likely/ they are younger than Molly.

** I always assumed they were older and never even considered that they might be twins, but I don't know where those assumptions came from. As far as I know, canon does not make it clear.

** I think this is a case of fanon becoming confused with canon (at least for me!) because before this thread I would have said absolutely without a doubt they are twins and older than Molly. It's interesting that canon actually does not specify.

** I always thought they were younger than Molly, based on Fred and George being named for them. I assumed Gideon and Fabian were murdered somewhere between Percy being born and the twins being born, hence why the twins names honored them, not any of the older three boys. If Molly and Arthur were already out of school and on her 4th pregnancy, they would be younger and closer in age to the Marauders and co.

** Thank you for all of your answers. I'm glad to see I didn't miss a resource, and it's kind of nice knowing I can put them at Hogwarts in a time frame closer than when Molly was attending without it having to be an AU element.
