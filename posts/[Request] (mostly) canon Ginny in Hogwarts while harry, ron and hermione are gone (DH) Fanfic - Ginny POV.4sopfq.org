I'm looking for a fanfic about the year of the Deathly Hallows book, where Ginny is at school, with canon ships and mostly canon setting and stuff. Anything that it's not settled in the books, ok to imagine it new. Do you know any that's good?

thanks!!


** Bruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh

linkffn(Not From Others) by [[/u/FloreatCastellum]] is *THE DEFINITIVE* fic for that request.

*** Agree so much on this. As someone who loves Ginny-centric and Harry/Ginny post-hogwarts stories, [[/u/FloreatCastellum]] is the best. When you think of the thousands of stories written on Harry Potter, to get to a place where so many consider one story as the definitive story for a particular genre is really something.

Part of me heaping so much praise on [[/u/FloreatCastellum]] is so she'll agree to write the definitive "first 3 years after the battle" story. "The Aurors" is shaping up to be the definitive story based on Harry as a full-fledged Auror, so it only make sense that we get a good portrayal of the time in between ;)

**** You're too good to me. :) I will be setting fics within that time period, but I don't know about a recovery style fic. I need there to a be an anchoring plot or I just end up writing nonsense.

***** The one thing I rarely see in fics is the year apart Harry and Ginny spend at Hogwarts. I always thought that there was a lot of built up story in how they manage to be apart for a year so soon after they just got back together after the events of the deathly Hallows.

So many "right after the battle" fics have no conflict in the Harry/Ginny storyline, and they just portray them as this once-in-a-lifetime couple. But I think they should have to work for it and having them go through the trials of a long-distance relationship, act like teenagers and grow independently would be really interesting.

If you are planning on pursuing a story for that time period, I'll pm you some thoughts I have.

****** Don't you think that 'the guy went out on guerilla warfare' and 'the girl stayed to run underground resistance' is very very romantic?

******* Not necessarily very romantic, no. But even if it was, I'm afraid I don't see your point. Harry and Ginny might have this eternal love, and I have no issues with writers who want to portray that. But if I'm going to read a novel-length story, I need there to be conflict in the plot. And too often, writers will have no conflict between the two. I'm not saying they need to cheat on each other or nearly break up at the end of every chapter, but I like a more realistic portrayal of the couple.

****** I'm not planning that just yet. I have plans for a Remus Lupin fic (which would be heavy going but therapeutic to write) and a humour fic inspired by Brexit (which I think may be too political and get me a load of hate, but would be so much fun to write), I just haven't decided which one. I have some ideas for one shots and short stories within that time period, but for the time being I won't be writing a large fic about it.

** Aside from Not From Others, try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8078750/1/A-Call-to-Arms][A Call to Arms]] by My Dear Professor McGonagall. The second half is from McGonagall's PoV, after Ginny has to leave Hogwarts.
