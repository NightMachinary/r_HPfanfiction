A few observations from canon:

1. From the fact that he doesn't do so, we can assume that Voldemort is not strong enough to just waltz into the Ministry and take it over by force single handed.

2. Dumbledore mentions that Aurors will be coming soon to Voldemort in OotP, as if their arrival would present a genuine threat to Voldemort.

3. Dawlish, Fudge, Umbridge and Percy in OotP presented no threat whatsoever to Dumbledore, who took them out with a single spell in an instant. I've excluded Kingsley due to his true allegiance, but it's worth noting that Dumbledore's spell took him out along with all the others.

4. Dumbledore toys with Dawlish like he presents no threat whatsoever.

5. In FB1, if you consider that canon, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HERsolqyZc][Graveswald]] was able to shield the attacks of maybe 20 MACUSA wizards simultaneously.

6. In FB2, if you consider that canon, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EV4HAN44104][Grindelwald]] was able to defeat a large number of Aurors (again, around 20), not only defending himself from them but also killing most of them.

So, with that in mind: how many Aurors do you think would have been necessary to take Voldemort down?

Canonically, I think 15 Aurors is the bare minimum needed, but given the Grindelwald scene in FB2, that figure may be far too low.

In fanfic, I prefer to make Aurors fewer in number but more powerful - elite dark wizard hunters, as they were originally billed in GoF, rather than general law enforcement personnel as JKR has come to use them as.

I would have it as maybe 4 Aurors being sufficient to bring Voldemort in, if they managed to confront him in a fair fight - but the Ministry would have access to maybe 12 Aurors total, with most of them away on long term missions at any given time. And the gap between Aurors and the average wizard would be much greater than in canon, such that Voldemort would still be pretty untouchable no matter how many normal wizards ganged up on him. So I don't /downgrade/ Voldemort; rather, I /upgrade/ the Aurors.


** In canon he single-handedly fought Professors McGonagall, Slughorn and the auror Kingsley Shacklebolt who apparently was one of the stronger aurors in the force. All three were protected by Harry's sacrifice, and he still finally knocked them over with one single spell. Since I'd consider the average auror to be far weaker than Shacklebolt or Hogwarts professors, Voldemort could probably take on more than three. Though it might depend on how well they can actually work together and how afraid they are of him.

After all, when Dumbledore single-handedly demolished the Death-Eaters in OotP, they didn't even try fighting back. It might be similar for aurors against Voldemort.

** I think the threat was about Dumbledore + a few aurors, not the aurors themselves. Like, as shown in canon, if Dumbledore is fighting Voldemort, Dumbledore can mostly keep up. Say Dumbledore and 1 auror focus on defense, and the other 3 focus on offense, it doesn't seem crazy that they could hinder Voldemort. If nothing else, they can cast Avada Kedavra, which might cause at least transient death or disembodiment to Voldemort.

*** There actually isn't any standardised Auror training in canon - they only recruit one new Auror every few years, per McGonagall in OotP. Nowhere near enough to populate any kind of "Auror school". Rather, they appear to have a kind of apprenticeship to an experienced Auror - we know Tonks was taught by Mad-Eye.

In any event, their training would not be what makes them "become a quarter as powerful as Voldemort". Rather, the Aurors would only recruit elite students - those who had that potential already. After all, as described [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/gi2own/realistically_how_strong_could_a_wizard_be_at_a/fqcs331/][here]], most of the magic which Aurors use will be magic they already know from Hogwarts, meaning that Auror training is going to be focused on /applying/ that magic to hunting Dark wizards, rather than learning entirely new magic.

** Canonically?

I'd say all of them, like at a certain point they are just going to stand in each others way, and adding more wont really do anything to improve their chances against Voldemort, while having them worry about friendly fire. And I honesly believe that point is reached before you could ever overwhelm him.

There is also the problem that Voldemort has no qualms about using the Imperius curse and each Auror you add is another possible enemy the other Aurors have to face, and definitely decreasing their moral. And before you say that wouldn't work on Aurors, we see the Imperius curse work on Moody in addition to Crouch Jr and Sr.

The only difference is if one of those Auror has access to significant magical knowledge Voldemort isn't fully aware of, like Harry did in the end with the whole wand ownership thing, or manages to somewhat catch him off guard like Newt did with Grindelwald.

Unlike in other universe where a wizard learn to cast "Fire lvl1", then "Fire lvl2" and so on, in HP, a simple Incendio, that can only do a weak little flame when cast by a 1st year, can be used by an experimented wizard to burn an entire forest.

So even in the case where Auror where "trained to resist the Imperius" (which is already discutable since the spell is an Unforgivable, and Crouch Jr using it in GoF is really shown as "Mad Eye Constant Vigilance ideology" rather than a Ministry approved training"), being able to resist the Imperius cast by a fellow Auror, or even a Death Eater like Malfoy, does not mean you can resist one cast by Voldemort himself.

To be fair, I got the impression Voldemort never did that because he'd draw the attention of the International Confederation of Wizards, and then have the whole world against him (instead of just the Order + the Auror Office). Also doing that might force Dumbledore's hand and he would want to avoid a duel with Dumbledore if he's no guaranteed to win. It just means Voldemort is paranoid and wouldn't take unnecessary risks, even if he wouldn't be in any actual danger from the Ministry alone.

#+end_quote

Personally, I don't think Rowling downgraded the Aurors to being regular police. Its just that Aurors are put against far stronger opponents.

- Moody vs Crouch Jr + Wormtail --- Moody was retired and outnumbered by two highly talented wizards, taken by surprise, and wasn't as good as in his prime. In DH, Voldemort believed Moody was more skilled than Kingsley.

- Moody vs Dolohov --- Dolohov is one of the most skilled Death Eaters (held his own against Sirius, dueled the Trio almost singlehandedly then later killed Lupin) so its not a bad showing for Moody, who was retired and not as good as his prime.

- Tonks/Kingsley vs Bellatrix --- Bellatrix is either the best or second best of Voldemort's Death Eater (depending on how you rank Snape). Tonks had far less experience, and Bellatrix only needed one direct hit on Kingsley so maybe she was just faster than him.

- Grindelwald in FB1 and FB2 --- Its Grindelwald, so the Aurors getting stomped was the expected outcome. Dumbledore could probably do the same to the Death Eaters.

Kingsley and Moody don't really represent the average Aurors since they would be much more skilled than other Aurors. I'd say Tonks is far more accurate of how skilled most Aurors are, and I'd say any Auror would be able to comfortably beat DH Harry 1v1.

Its interesting that after Voldemort's first downfall, the Ministry was perfectly capable of defeating all of Voldemort's Death Eaters using the combined numbers of Aurors and Hit WIzards Even the top-tiers like Bellatrix and Dolohov who could beat the likes of Kingsley, Tonks, Moody, or Lupin 1v1. So with Voldemort out of the picture, the Aurors is capable of dealing with even the best Death Eaters.

We also see Slughorn as highly courted by Voldemort (though that could be personal connection or potion ability alone). All the jmportant Hogwarts professors seem to be about as powerful as a normal Wizard/Witch we see.

Tonks is a promising Auror and from what we have seen she isn't anywhere near as powerful or respected as the Hogwarts professors so I take most aurors to be a tier below such that you would need two or three aurors for a given main professor.

To be fair he took them by surprise.

4 aurors is imo way too little to pose a real threat to Voldemort. He took three top tier wizards at once at the end of Hogwarts battle, Kinglsey and McGonagall are probably head and shoulders above the average auror, it would take more than 4 Tonks or Dawlishes to defeat Voldy imo.

** 4 Aurors just sounds like too few in my head.

Given that, and given your criteria, I think with 4 Voldemort has the slight edge. ex.

- 1) A desperate fight for Aurors, but one if it were a story (particularly with Harry) the heroes could /just/ pull out of the bag, or otherwise delay, hamper etc.\\

But

- 2) if it were 'offscreen' then every chance it would be a shocking and terrifying news story 'Two Aurors Slain! Two more injured, one critical...' And would need to be given the sort of weight of major battles or countries being lost. Think Holland, Belgium, and France fall like dominoes, Dunkirk and Britain reel, the war has suddenly become bitter and desperate, and (on appearance) it's only a matter of time until victory of the enemy is assured.

5 could go either way (more like WW1 trench stalemate), and 6 Aurors gain a distinct edge.

Only other thing I disagree on is FB1/2, I sort of dismiss the specifics (like numbers, actual Aurors, even spells) and accept the broad-brush strokes that a single wizard bested many government wizards.

** There's no set number - it depends on the circumstances of the fight. An ambush by Aurors will go much differently than an ambush by Voldemort, for example. Generally, in most battles, the attacker has the advantage and initiative, at least at the beginning. The defender is reacting, perhaps caught on the wrong foot, and usually takes at least a bit to find out what is happening. If they're in their home base, so to speak, they'll likely have some preparations and plans, but if they're caught somewhere else, the battle might already have been decided by the time the defender gets a clearer picture of what's happening.

Strongly disagree. Magical fights are almost always won in canon by the greater wizard, and are almost always won by the application of superior magical ability.

I agree that objectives matter - but then what you haven't isn't necessarily a fight, but something else (e.g. a chase scene, like the DoM fight).

Unless you are talking about how you prefer to do things in your fanfiction, rather than what you think canon shows? I find it's generally best to flag which one you are talking about.

Anyway, even without canon support, logically magical ability is clearly the most important factor. If Voldemort's magical ability is such that he can cast a single spell which can instantly obliterate 20 Aurors, then this is a game-changing ability compared to a world where Voldemort's strongest spell can only kill, say, 3 Aurors at once. Which is in turn game changing compared to a world where Voldemort can't immediately kill any Aurors, but rather has to work to overcome their defences. All three of those positions is potentially canon-compatible.

******** Without objectives, you just have some thought exercise without any value. Like those vs. videos where a couple of soldiers are put against each other in "simulations" without taking into account how they actually were deployed. Morale also plays a huge role - few will fight to the death no matter the odds. Voldemort has a huge advantage in that his reputation alone will have a significant effect on his enemies, making them more likely to flee than fight as soon as things get tricky.

However, in canon, Voldemort couldn't even kill a single boy in a graveyard. So, the ability to actually hit what you're aiming at, and - for Harry - the ability to take cover and move - seems a bit more important than knowing spells. Also, the mere existence of the Killing Curse means that we've got a similar situation as with modern firearms - anyone with a minimum of training (and the needed hatred) can kill anyone else if they manage to hit them. You don't need superior magical ability, you just need to land the Killing Curse. And the only defence against it is not to get hit - meaning, using hard cover, movement, and concealment. Or, in other words, tactics. (Unless you fold all the tactics of how to use spells and how to move and take cover etc. into "magical ability".)

In the same sense, a spell that can wipe out 20 Aurors at once is useless if you can't hit the enemy - or if you can't detect them in time. Or if they are spread out so you can't get everyone even if you hit one. Also, based on canon, we can safely assume that if Voldemort cannot kill Harry in a rigged duel as soon as Harry starts running and taking cover, then he would have trouble killing Aurors as well if they used similar tactics. On the other hand, standing your ground seems to be asking for a Killing Curse to the face, and, therefore, an inferior tactic.

So, based on canon events, how powerful your spells are doesn't matter as much as how well you can use them and how well you can fight from a tactical point of view.

Actual combat is more complex than an arena death match.

** Depends. Does he use fiendfyre? (Why doesn't he just always use fiendfyre?)

The way I've always imagined it is, as a rule of thumb - the average wizard isn't particularly skilled, the Hogwarts Professors tend to be at the top-tier of their respective subjects, the Aurors are highly-trained, but Dumbledore and Voldemort (and Grindelwald as well) are so beyond everyone else they're basically demi-gods. If you were rating the wizarding world 1-00 like in fighting video games, Dumbledore and Voldemort would be mid 90s and then the next best would be mid 80s, but there's probably loads of wizards in that cluster of 'next best', such as McGonagall, Snape, Aurors, Bellatrix, Harry by the time he's Head Auror etc.

I'd gather Voldemort could probably defeat a whole bunch of Aurors on his own, but it'd be a struggle, bothersome and cost a whole lot of time. He doesn't seem like the type to enjoy long or exhausting duels.

There is no canon evidence that /anyone/ can control Fiendfyre. It's quite possible that the standard tactic is to just cast it an apparate away.

**** My understanding was that it is exceptionally difficult to control Fiendfyre, but that the more powerful/disciplined/greater the wizard, the more chance they would have to actually control and use it, but you're right that there's no actual in-text evidence to support that.

*** I agree with your number system adding the other 2 HoH to your 80s (high 80s), rest of (long term) professors high 70s and 80s, field experts high70s, field specialists low 70s, average wizards 60s. Poor wizards 30s - 50s, poltergeists and Squibs 10s and 20s (based on Mrs. Fig could at least see the dementors unlike Muggles), Muggles and ghosts 1 - 10, corpses 0.

This is the first time I've ever actually wrote all that out, normally it's just something I keep in mind when writing. I believe power and ability depend heavily on dedication and practise. Like a 13 yr battling how many dementors singlehandedly? I think if Harry applied himself enough he'd make demigod status like the old geezers. I also headcanon all souls have magic but it's blocked.

**** I think the number system helps as a general rule of thumb (and makes me crave a Harry Potter fighting/dueling video game) but as you say, it's more about dedication/strength and practice (as well as intelligence etc). Obviously got to be careful not to fall into the trap of assuming that wizards have different inherent 'power levels' or 'magical cores' though.

***** Agreed, I see it as potential energy vs. kinetic energy. Everyone has the potential to be level 99 or 100, and for some it's easier to level up. Neville was thought to be a possible squib until he bounced and that's when his internal power surfaced. I feel most of his 'energy' is internal making him great at herbology. I think if he could focus his memory he'd be just as good with arithmancy and other internalized magics. Take Mrs Fig, she communicates with her partial kneazels, but Hermione doesn't because she focuses her magic in other ways. I believe Mrs. Fig's internal magic is blocked from becoming external, but she focuses so much on her kneazels her interval magic manifests into communication giving Mr. Tibbles to literally spy for her. Just think, if Hermione knew that was a possibility she might have worked with Crookshanks and the whole mess with Peter resolved much easier.

Edit: forgot to ask your thoughts.

3,Dawlish,Fudge his lackey and Percy aren't exactly the toughest with a wand..... Kingsley went down willingly for appearances sake.

4,see my response for 3.

5 and 6,Grindlewald may actually be a better wizard than Voldemort...... From what I gather Grindlewald led an open war as opposed to Voldemort who used hit and run tactics and fear to rule the day.

** Voldemort is as strong as needs to be. We go in assuming the end boss is Voldemort, unless stated otherwise, so that many Aurors.

Voldemort's operation is based on the Terrors so he's at his best doing hit and run diversion tactics. Actually pinning him down and dueling him would probably show he's kind of a one trick pony.

A trained Auror, that I would write, on an even field should last a while, 10 would definitely bog him down and I agree 15 would ice him. However Voldemort, to me, wouldn't do that.

He'd surprise them along with scaring the hell out of them from all the stories they heard and would dip after he AK'd 30 cackling madly after.

** tl;dr: There is no amount of Aurors that can defeat Voldemort. He is too smart to be overpowered. He is too powerful to be meaningfully opposed. He is too skilled to be outwitted magically. He is too experienced to let himself get into a situation that could feasibly end in his defeat. After all, the all-consuming driving force behind him is his /fear of death/.

This topic reminds me of this great quote: /“Hearing a succession of mediocre singers does not add up to a single outstanding performance.”/

If you want to survive Voldemort wand-to-wand (not oppose him, just /survive/ a confrontation with him), then you /need/ to be Dumbledore-level (or one lucky AF scarface).

--------------

But I enjoy your intepretation.

#+begin_quote
  I would have it as maybe 4 Aurors being sufficient to bring Voldemort in
#+end_quote

Big disagree. I think you're severely underestimating Voldemort's intelligence, and just how much MORE powerful he is than even powerful wizards. Quite simply: he would never allow himself to be in a situation where any array of powerful wizards can simultaneously oppose him.

As with the Ministry battle in "Order of the Phoenix" - he sends his lackeys in first, and not just shitty Snatcher-tier ones, but his "elite" - the Inner Circle of his followers.

I would say that Voldemort is easily the most powerful wizard in the "Potterverse". After all, he is decades younger than Dumbledore and can quite handily give him a run for his money. People always talk about how Voldemort has never beaten Dumbledore. But Dumbledore never defeated Voldemort when they duelled, either. Drift your mine back to the Order of the Phoenix, Ministry Atrium duel - at some point, Voldemort just screamed in rage and the sheer power of it threw Dumbledore off his feet and /forced/ Dumbledore to defend himself and Harry.

But to directly target your question - if we assumed that there is a cornered Voldemort, with seemingly no means of escape... then, simply put, he will kill everything around him and escape - there is no alternative. I like to envisage the Dark Lord as having "Hulk-like" power, whereby his anger magnifies his strength beyond what seems possible. We see this in the Deathly Hallows movie too (much as I hate to reference it); When Voldemort's diadem Horcrux is destroyed, he feels /something/, and that makes him angry enough that he single-handedly shatters the protective enchantments surrounding the school. If that happened in fanfiction, we'd say he was overpowered. We've already seen hundreds of Death Eaters being unable to take down those enchantments from the Outside, but when he got angry. He just fucking annihilated them

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zV7jTYTK6Us][Seriously, just watch it.]] - Stupid-levels of power. One thing I'd forgotten from this scene, which is QUITE SIGNIFICANT - /His power CRACKS the Elder Wand.../ - This is the single most powerful application of magic we ever see in the movies.

Cue "It was at this Point, the students knew they fucked up."

Bonus: [[https://youtu.be/Dkxx0pKgkN4?t=186][Here's ANOTHER]] depiction of the Dark Lord screaming and wrecking stuff in his rage. Neat little thing to notice - when he destroys all that around him, he /isn't holding a wand/ (due to him using Malfoy Sr's and Harry just having broken that). That's just his straight-up hilarious amount of power ruining everything around him.

Think about it.

His power (with the Elder Wand) is greater than the /combined/ power of /every other/ mage who erected those protections.

Given that interpretation, which I quite enjoy, I would simply say that there is no collection of magical individuals in the "Potterverse" that can oppose him.

Aurors are nothing in comparison. I just think he's /too/ powerful. Once he is on the backfoot his power explodes out, and there is /nothing/ you can do to defend against it.

--------------

Assume there's - let's say twenty - highly-skilled Aurors battering him down, making him weary, cornering him and forcing him to defend himself. In my mind, no matter who is in front of him, at some point during their fighting, Voldemort will start unleashing ridiculously powerful magic that (some) of the Aurors are unable to defend from.

20 Aurors dwindles down to, say, 16. Errant Curses, still blisteringly powerful, slice through the weaker Aurors. They were too shocked at suddenly fighting /the Dark Lord/ to form adequate defence as he blasted them to atoms.

The Dark Lord continues throwing stupidly powerful magic around. One wrong move from the Aurors, one hesitant Shield Charm, one slow deflection - they are insta-killed.

16 Aurors becomes 12, becomes 10.

Perhaps he grows weary, or distracted, and is again forced to defend. His fury grows at his circumstances, these Aurors are /inferior/ to him and he needs to prove it. He either finds a means to escape, or gathers his magic in another explosive ejection. They are powerless to his might.

10 Aurors becomes 5 in an instant. The victims of his wrath are reduced to smears of blood and charred bone.

5 Aurors are insufficient. Maybe they retreat? That would be the sensible option. Their spells are too slow. Combined, they are vastly too weak against the fury of a Dark Lord. The Aurors tire too, they have faced no other opponent who throws stupid-levels of magic around like he can.

5 Aurors becomes 4, becomes 3... He's toying with them now, he's getting /creative/ with his spell-choice - his cruelty is refined, and without equal. The people cleaning up their bodies will known what it means to oppose a Dark Lord.

That is the level at which I think Voldemort operates. Dumbledore is his singular peer. His biggest enemy is himself.
