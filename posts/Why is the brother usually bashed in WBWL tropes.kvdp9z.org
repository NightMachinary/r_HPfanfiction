** I would say the reason the WBWL is bashed is either, 1) people want a bully or an antagonist that is easily hateable, or 2) They feel that due to the fact James/Lily/Albus/whoever got rid of harry, the other twin would be spoiled to an amount originally fit for two very very very rich kids.

** The author wants to highlight how dysfunctional the potter family is and how much better Harry is to the other twin.

** They want a James Junior as a marauder bully. Having that parallel of someone who truly is 'just like your father' gives Harry a reference point, to highlight what's different. And since Harry is the protagonist, the comparisons focus on the areas where JayJu is lacking.

Yes, the relationship developing is scarce. But that's because the focus is often to compare, not uplift everyone.

Linkffn(His twenty-eighth life) has a loveable WBWL.

  HPLV. Harry Potter has been reborn again and again into new bodies as the Master of Death---but he has always helped to defeat Voldemort in each new world. Now his slightly older brother is the target of the prophecy, and Harry assumes his role is to support Jonathan. At least, that's what he thinks until Voldemort kidnaps him that Halloween night.

** Ok you know what would be funny a Wbwl fic where the Op God Protagonist gets bashed after a couple of chapers.

** Because that's what the trope is about and that is sadly what the readers like.

How would you like a fic where:

James and Lily abandon Harry.

Harry's twin becomes super powerful and defeats Voldemorts for breakfast. He completely toys with Harry and then kills him after giving him a speech on forgiveness. Then in the Epilogue he and his parents live happily ever after.
