Still no word from the beta reader, except that she/he accepted, and asked if he/she should focus on grammar and IC-ness, and can he/she copy-paste it and point out the mistakes. I agreed to both, so I'll be waiting.

EDIT: Here's the message.

Hey! Yes, I'd love to beta-read your story for you. Just to be clear, you want me to focus on just IC-ness? Or add comments about the grammar as well? Also, is it fine with you if I copy-paste the story into a Word document, so I can properly edit it?

And as I said in my beta-reader profile, I'm honest----sometimes, that can be a bit painful. How thick is your skin when it comes to reviews?

My reply: Thanks for the reply, sorry I haven't replied though. Now I want you to focus on IC and grammar. And yeah, it's fine if you copy-paste it. And it's alright if you're an honest beta reader, I'm used to criticism, so it's all good.

EDIT: I just got a review a few days ago, and thank God it was a positive review.

Okay, I'll be announcing some recent changes. Fred won't be back, well, not alive at least. I'm rewriting it again, this time it won't be too fast, I'll be taking my time. Snape might make a come back, just have to figure out how.


** Honestly this is a bit of a mess. Lots of stuff that is ridiculously OOC. e.g.

You have Hagrid cracking jokes, Puns even.

This exchange between Arthur and Molly is just ridiculous. Arthur wouldn't be that insenstive: "It's all right, Molly, it's alright."

"NO! It's not alright! We just lost our children!" Molly shouted, angrily.

"I know that, Molly! But it already happened! And there's nothing we can do about it!"

Harry (the high priest of guilt, in love with Ginny) and Hermione (has been in love with Ron forever) just decide to go for it at their funeral? Really? I think you could have an interesting story about what would happen to Harry and Hermionie's relationship if Ron and Ginny died. But there is no way those characters would rush into something like that. It just doesn't make any sense. Have a little patients and you might get a more convincing story.

*** Hmm, you have a point there, I might edit it one day, you mind pointing out all those characters I got into OOC?

EDIT: How about this, I rewrote that part. "Are you feeling okay, dear? You haven't talked to the guests."

"I'm still distraught from what happened, it's just too soon, and Ginny was my only daughter." Molly replied.

"I know how you feel, dear, I miss them too, but I believe that they're both in a better place now."

"You believe in that, Arthur?"

"Of course. You need anything else, dear?"

"Just stay close to me, Arthur."

"I'm okay with that, now, let's go to our son and daughter."

** I didn't get very far, and here is why: grammar.

It looks like you tried to write long, complicated sentences by mashing smaller sentences together, rather than using proper grammar. This makes your sentences hard to read, and therefore unpleasant to read. Unreadable sentences and bad grammar are my number 1 reason for not reading a story, and you've got bad grammar right in the description.

Also Harry has never once called Hermione 'Mione. If you're desperate for this nickname for some reason, let the characters grow into it.

*** I don't get it though, some people say my grammar is really good. I don't see nothing wrong, just some characters gotten OOC.

****** A great fix for this would be to find a grammatically-inclined beta to read over your chapters and discuss stylistic problems and grammatical errors with you.

** In regards to dialogue, I think it comes off as stilted and unnatural. Part of the problem is the grammar--you should consider getting a Beta to catch some of those problems if you can't find them yourself. But another problem is just that, to me, the dialogue doesn't flow well. When you're writing a conversation, you should try reading all the lines aloud. You can even get a friend to help read a conversationwith you. Can you imagine two people talking like this? Sometimes phrasing we use in writing just isn't ever spoken, and it comes off awkwardly when you use it in dialogue.

** You should work on sentence construction, particularly commas. And there's just no real build-up. It is very weak.

You also honestly should have just made up new characters--as other people are saying, your version behave terribly out of character. They are barely real people, just names. Read some more books and perhaps the highly acclaimed fanfictions (Dumbledore's Army, Difference in the Family, and Alexandra Quick) to really study how the characters and magical world are portrayed.

** I gave up because the dialogues are too stiff: it doesn't sound natural, be it the form or content. You should ask yourself if you would speak like that yourself.

** Okay, I've decided to take it down, as I've sent a request from a Beta Reader to beta read it. I'll be posting it again if I know how the characters works, what their personalities and traits are etc.

*** Please also do some more reading and get a sense of what makes a story a story. My first stories were terrible. I'm rereading and editing some of them now and laughing at how bad I used to be. How did I improve? I kept reading and writing, kept comparing my plot and style to other writers. I have my own style, but it's one that works.

*** Yes, it includes Ghost Ron, and I tried changing the "Harry P. and Ron" into "Harry P. and Hermione G." But it still turns into Harry P. And Ron W. I'll just edit the description right now.
