I know this is terrible, but don't judge me!

So essentially Harry gets sent to the Marauder Era and falls in love with one of his parents. I would prefer fem!Harry with the James pairing but I'm not picky. Thanks!

Harry travels to the 70s and becomes his mother's fuck buddy. There's a funny scene where the Marauders catch them fucking, but instead of stopping, Harry and Lily keep going at it.
