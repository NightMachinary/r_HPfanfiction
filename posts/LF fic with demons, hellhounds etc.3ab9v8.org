Recently I read Bound in Servitude by Little.Miss.Zanda, and I was wondering if there were any others like it floating around out there. I'm interested in anything demon, demonic, hellspawn or Lovecraftian... but no bad manga x-overs with evil ninja butlers. Help a bored nerd find something to read, please? =-)


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4323036/1/Gentleman-Usher-of-the-Scarlet-Rod]] is the only crossover with Lovecraft I've really read. I've not read much Lovecraft so it was nice not knowing what was coming next. I enjoyed it enough to recommend giving it a read and even if you don't get on with it, it's only 40k words so whats the harm?

HGSS "After the Final Battle, everyone has their demons to wrestle..."

I found this fic to be very compelling, and the demon aspect played a prominent role in the second half of the fic. I know it isn't some epic romp, but it is quite lovely for what it is.\\
Also, I adore this author.

  Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see. Harry Potter and the Cthulhu Mythos clash.

  The Tale of Three Brothers was not a legend. It was a warning. No one cheats Death. And luckily for Lily Potter, the promise of the Cloak's return in exchange for her son's life was a fair deal. Stare into the abyss, Harry Potter, and we will see who blinks first.
