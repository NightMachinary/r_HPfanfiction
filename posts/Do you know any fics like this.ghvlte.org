Hello! I am looking for more fics to read and feel like reading the following kind of fic at the moment.

Any fic with harry, or femharry I don't mind, where he is very powerful and that is postwar, timetravel or a combination of both.

Thank you very much in advance.

  Hollis Potter walked into what she thinks is the final battle of the war that's been raging for the last six years, only to find, when it's over and she's officially lost everything, that she's not where she's supposed to be. Or, rather, she's not when she's supposed to be. She wouldn't have made it as far as she did without being stubborn, however, so she pushed past the surprise and the grief and decides to change it, no matter the cost. --Cross-posted on FanFic: Hollis Potter, with grim determination, walks into a battle that will make or break England - and affect the World War raging around them. The outcome is surprising, even for her, and she is left with nothing to do but adapt. [Slightly Edited/Reworked]
