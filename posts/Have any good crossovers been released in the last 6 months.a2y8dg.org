** If you relax your timeline to the past 1.5 years, then Ripples in the Force is quite good. HP/SW X-over. It is still being updated, got one last month.

  This was turning out to be one of 'those' missions. Truly, Harry should have expected it. He was a Potter. Without fail, every mission eventually turned out to be one of 'those' missions. Some actions send ripples throughout the galaxy as a whole. This is a story of one such event.

** Swords and Sorcery, a Harry Potter/Fate Stay Night UBW crossover, is actually really, really good. Interesting premise, updates regularly on Spacebattles, has been going on for two years now, I love it.

Susanooh does a very good job of making everything interesting and awesome.

Otherwise, there's a recently started HP/Worm that looks interesting.

Any fandom in particular that you would be interested in as a main crossover?

Can you give me a link for this one or do you mean "Simurgh's Son"?

The only HP/Worm Crossover that ever really hooked me was "Insatiable" and that updates so rarely that I never even want to recommend it to anyone because it's just too short for now...

*** How much knowledge you need from the Fate to get this fic? I only saw Fate/Zero, the old Fate/Stay Night(like when it came out) and UBW. None of the new ones. Didn't read the LN either.

***** Cool. At first I didn't know if I'd like that, but then I saw its femHarry and said, "Fuck yeh".

Idk why, but I love xovers with femHarry. There's 2 in the Eragon world that I simply adore.

  After Voldemort's defeat, Helena had thought she could live a quiet life (as quiet a life as The-Woman-Who-Conquered could live). Fate had other plans for her, and one morning she wakes up in the Spine in Alagaësia. With a new companion by her side, and new friends at her arm, Helena takes on the world. Rider!Harry. Fem!Harry/Eragon. Book One of the 'By Wisdom and Courage' series.

**** I've never watched any of the Fate series and I love that story. I had to look up Shirou for reference on who his character is, but even that isn't really necessary.
