I'm looking for is also a pureblood one. Marcus Flint/fem harry potter.

They're betrothed but she isn't totally pleased. But he gives her a beautiful doll and she also moves into the slytherin dorms.

Oh and its normal for pureblood girls to have dolls well into their teen years as it helps them practise magic???
