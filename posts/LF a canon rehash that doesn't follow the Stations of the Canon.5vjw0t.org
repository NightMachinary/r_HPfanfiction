*** I think he's looking for an AU story of the same time period that canon occurs in. He says canon rehash but I think he means Years 1-7 rehash, but with "doesn't follow the Stations of the Canon" I think he means that the same major events of canon do not take place.

** That's a double-negative there mate. It can't be a canon rehash if it doesn't follow the layout or events of canon.

** So you're looking for a story that's not a canon rehash? That's generally referred to as AU - Alternate Universe. There's a million stories though, gotta be more specific.

** If you are looking for Years 1-7 fics that do NOT have Voldemort returning around Year 4, then you will be SEVERELY disappointed.

I made [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5kb91z/rant_and_request_looking_for_fics_that_begin_in/][a similar request]] last month and didn't get a single (completed) recommendation to my liking. However, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11669575/1/For-Love-of-Magic][For Love of Magic]], linkffn(11669575), looks promising.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/Patron][Patron]], linkffn(11080542), is as AU as you can get, and written by someone who generally doesn't care much for canon stations. Voldemort still came back at the end of Year 4, although he didn't bother to abduct Harry at all.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5604382/1/The-Accidental-Bond][The Accidental Bond]], linkffn(5604382), still has Voldemort trying the TWT plot, [[/spoiler][but Harry and his girls nuked his attempt right in the Graveyard, and Harry got rid of his scar earlier]]. So I would say this fic came very close to what you want.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** The All New Adventures of Hermione Granger in... The Chance of a Lifetime (linkffn(11453335)) just updated recently. Hermione from an apocalyptic future time travels to her childhood, where she slowly regains her memories. Her changes from Book 0 (as a child) changes enough that Book 1 (first year) is quite different, where a malicious hag is charged to protect Harry. There are other plotlines behind that though, because Hermione is trying to also save the world from the apocalyptic future.

Whenever I think of a cannon rehash, I always think about this fic, which has nothing to do with a philosopher's stone or a Quirrelmort, as a comparison for uniqueness.

  After bitter losses but more than a century of magical study and growth, the smartest witch is reborn to defang the wicked, save Harry, friends, and perhaps the world. Childhood plus Hogwarts years with villains but no Voldemort, so 8 all-new books. Action! Adventure! Angst! Puzzles! Problems! Payback! Fantasy! Friendship! Fluff! Harry/Hermione. Plus Neville. Ron. Ginny. Luna.
