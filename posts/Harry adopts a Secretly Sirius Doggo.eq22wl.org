So, I read Rune Stone Path at some point and really liked the treatment of Sirius in that fic - he pretended to be a dog for a while until Harry adopted him - so I'm looking for more fics with a similar idea where Harry adopts Padfoot.

He can do so without knowing like in Rune Stone Path or knowingly like a fic I can't remember the name of where Sirius slept at the foot of Harry's bed after Dumbledore let Sirius stick around. There was some mention of Sirius returning to Padfoot as a comfort form - or so I think, anyway. But yes. Harry adopts the Secretly Sirius Doggo Padfoot fics, please. :)


** There is one fic about Harry being more abused than canon and he adopts Sirius as a service dog.. can't recall the name for the life of me. Pretty sure he befriended Draco as well but that's all. Hopefully someone else remembers it and can give a name.

**** That's the one! I remember I came across it during a Luna/Harry phase. Hasn't been updated since late 2018 though, so just a heads up to any interested.

** The Wolf Lord has something along that line happen, though it is someone other than Harry that adopts doggo Sirius, [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12855468/1/The-Wolf-Lord]]

** There was a great fic where Sirius was adopted by Harry, who thought he was a normal dog. He was called Wolfsbane. :) really sweet and cute fic

** Nightmares of Futures Past did this, though as a Peggy Sue story, Harry naturally knew that Sirius was Padfoot.
