It's one of the oldest and best fics on there! Every time I do a search of the site. It doesn't come up and I have not been able to find it search Manually or just going through the top favorite fics. Does anyone have a link or a downloaded copy?

** linkffn(5554780) and yes [[https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare][FanFicFare]] (either as a standalone command line utility or a Calibre plugin) is hugely useful.

** A lot of the classics tend to no longer pop up when you search for them, both Genkai and Rorschach are good examples of authors who can be damn hard to find if you don't have them in your follows or otherwise saved
