Awhile back I read an omegaverse story where Harry Potter was an alpha and Hermione was his omega. In this story, Molly was drugging them both with different potions so as to get Ginny with Harry and produce a kid even if he ended up dying due to a broken heart like all alphas in this world who aren't able to find their omega. Ron was the unknowing deliverer of the potions and when he left is where the story starts since the potions start wearing off.
