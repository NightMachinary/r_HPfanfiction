Hi! As the title says, I'm looking for good LONG hermione-centric fics. To give you an idea, here's what I've recently read/my thoughts:

-Applied Cultural Anthropology: it was good, but I think over-hyped by this sub! (IMHO)

-Lady of the lake: LOVED IT!!

-The Green Girl: didn't like it as much, thought the writing was weak

-"the changeling," which is Ginny centric but also a very good read

-Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation: did not like

-The Muddy Princess: just started reading it

As I think this list suggests, I'm currently enjoying the dark-hermione, slytherin-hermione, or pureblood-hermione types of fics, and I also like dramione (although I've read MOST of the standard dramione recs), but please feel free to recommend anything with a good hermione character, even if its not dark and twisty.

Please no time travel stories, or H/Hr pairings, and I'm also looking for mainly late hogwarts or post hogwarts. Ginny-centric fics are also welcomed.

Thank you!!

Edit: Wow! Thank you so much everyone. SO many great recommendations on here, much more than I was ever expecting. If people are still coming to this thread please feel free to keep adding, these are all being bookmarked :D


** Have you tried The Arithmancer or Lady Archimedes by White Squirrel? It's one awesome series split into two books. There's no dark!Hermione, but the plot and characterization are very good. linkffn(11463030) linkffn(10070079)

There's also this collection of long Hermione-centric fics on ffn. Maybe you'll find something you like in here: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/The-Best-of-Hermione-60k-words-or-more/126645/99/0/1/0/0/0/0/]]

  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.

** "Reign of the Serpent" is very AU, and has a big ensemble cast, but Hermione is definitely the main character. The fic features a very cool Hermione who toughens up in order to survive in a more warlike wizarding world. No pairings yet, that I can see.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** Pet Project is a HG/SS I enjoyed a lot. It has some delightfully creative magics, avoids bashing, and doesn't make Snape into a nice person. He is still kind of a dick, Harry and Ron are good friends as best they can be, and the house elves are genuinely awesome. linkffn(2290003)

Another story I like is Big Name Death Eater. It's comedy, lighthearted SSHG with ridiculousness and no Horcruxes etc. Adult Hermione is bitchy in a charming way, and Lucius Malfoy kinda steals the show. Voldemort's demise is rather entertaining. The sequels are fun too, if I recall correctly. linkffn(2533891)

** For Slytherin Hermione, linkffn(Six Pomegranate Seeds by Seselt) is very interesting and unusual, with superb writing. It is technically a time travel/reincarnation (to 1991), but give it a try. No pairings so far.

Then there's linkffn(Keogh by ChelleyBean), which is probably my absolute favorite among Hermione-centric stories.

  In her sixth year, Dumbledore makes Hermione a key figure in a plan to help Harry defeat Voldemort. (It's difficult to summarize this without spoilers--- HG/SS; there's a Time Turner involved but probably not how you expect; the story really gets started in Chapter Three.)

To her, Hogwarts is a relief: a new school with new people who have no knowledge of her past...only, they keep asking the hard questions. And it's getting harder for Hermione to maintain the lies.

** linkffn(Those Gilded Chains We Wear) it's as much Bella-centric as it is Hermione, but overall very good fic, unless you are avoiding romance stories. Hermione isn't dark in this one, but there's quite a lot of dark topics in general. Unfortunately it's unfinished, but ends at a point where you won't be left with some massive cliffhanger or before the actual romance takes off.

****** I've gotten to a point where I usually reject most other pairings. But it works very well in that fic, the author actually manages to bring them together while still keeping them in character. Obviously they change a lot throughout but it's not like Hermione suddently decides to become a death eater after an argument with Harry and Bellatrix isn't a misunderstood good person who puts on a crazy facade, which is how people often seem to write her.

** Got quite a few for you here. Muddy Princess is great, you should pretty much just dig into colubrina and shayalonnie's stuff. Not all of it is dramione, but they both do stories on Hermione really well. *Debt of Time* linkffn(10772496) is Hermione/Sirius (and time travel) which I have never shipped, but it's /amazing./ Highly recommend.

- *Not From Others* - linkffn(11419408) This one gets recommened a lot on the sub and it's quite well-deserved. It covers Hallows from Ginny's POV, very good Hogwarts Resistance type stuff, with a well fleshed-out Ginny.

- *Better Off Forgotten* - linkffn(10715813) is an interesting one. Post-war AU with kind of a dark/manipulative premise, but the characterization is genuine and it's weirdly good dramione.

- *The Deadline* - linkffn(9831689) A lot of PWP here, so if you're not a fan of smut turn back now. But it's epilogue compliant dramione done well. I don't normally relate much to middle-aged depictions of HP characters, but this one managed. Bonus: one of the only times I've ever cared about the character Astoria Greengrass.

- *The Politician's Wife* - is amazing. Post-epilogue setup, with possibly my favorite depiction of Draco in any fic. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/90292/chapters/122722][link]]

- *Secrets* - set 9 years post-DH, not epilogue compliant. Has both Hermione and Draco back at Hogwarts as professors. Not exactly a dark depiction of Hermione, but definitely conflicted and weary. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/487896/chapters/850826][link]]

I completely agree about Applied Cultural Anthropology btw. It's decent, but not nearly as much as it's made out to be.
