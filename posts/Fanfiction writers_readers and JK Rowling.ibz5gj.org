I've been lurking on this subreddit for a while (I made my account a fortnight ago) and I've come to see that fanfiction is expanding and having fun with the world of Harry Potter without really interacting with the official people that made HP (if that makes sense). Saying that, I wanted to ask: what are the views of people here on JK Rowling- her tweets, both about Harry Potter and not, things she's done in the movies and books that have been slightly controversial, etc. I'm asking here rather than the Harry Potter subreddit even though I know this doesn't actually have much to do with fanfiction because people here have more of a... degree of separation from the official books/movies and thus, can be more objective. I don't want to start an argument, I don't want to make this a big deal, but I want to understand the general view in this subreddit.

Thanks

Edit: I was open for a friendly discussion, but I have see a comment under this post that I want to kindly ask the writer to delete. Let me make it clear: rights for people are not a grey area. You can say you agree with what Rowling is saying. I won't agree with you, but I'll leave it be. Saying that it is common sense to think that trans women are not women and slamming the black lives matter movement in the comments of my post is not something I will accept, as it doesn't contribute to anything. Someone going on a spiel about political views (especially ones including homophobia and racism) is not something I want people to see when they click on my post. Maybe replace your comment with something saying you think people are overreacting about what Rowling is saying and stick to the question asked, please. I want discussion, not hate.

Edit again because clarity- I'm not trying to say that you should cancel Rowling or force my opinions on you, as some people seem to interpret my post as that. Just to clarify, that was and is not my intention in the slightest. I'm just curious sjfnsofjeksdjnsjd


** I don't care much. She can tweet whatever she wants, I don't follow her on Twitter and don't really care about her opinions. I have my own and I don't need JKR to show me the way.

As for her additions to the HP world, it depends whether I like it or not. If it's something stupid I ignore it. If it's something I like (eg. Process of becoming animagi, Fleamont and Euphemia Potter) then I accept it as canon.

** Personally, I don't give a toss. I hold the author and the work separate and, while I might not agree with her opinions, I don't allow that to affect my enjoyment of her work. I do think she's been overly villainised for some poorly-expressed thoughts, I guess in part because she's such a prominent figure. For example, with the TERFism, I'm 50/50 because I kind of understand the point I think she was trying to make, but she did it very poorly and I equally understand how people who are stigmatised in that way would be offended. Without being inside her head, it's impossible to know. All the hate for e.g. Cho Chang's name is utterly ridiculous imo. It minimalises the impact of the genuinely potentially problematic issues (again, the TERFism) by creating a fuss out of a complete non-issue.

tl;dr: JKR has some thoughts I don't agree with, but I think she has been turned into a villain for lite reason. I keep my opinion of her opinions separate from my enjoyment of her work and I still love Harry Potter regardless of what she says.

** My feelings towards JKR are a combination of (1) ongoing respect and (2) frustration.

*Ongoing Respect*

Ongoing respect because I still think that what JKR did with the HP series is amazing, and it remains fresh and original and so captivating in comparison to pretty much everything else in the fantasy genre to this day.

There have been some post-DH creative missteps for sure, but I think many of these have been overblown by the fandom, often deliberately from a position of malice - people who want to tear down rather than build. I am not a particular fan of the Cursed Child (having both read it and seen the play live), but I think the way people have reacted to it has largely departed from cool headed rationality. I often feel quite embarrassed by the lack of moderation and respect in the behaviour of my fellow fans on this front.

Similarly, reactions to some of her HP-related Tweets seem to come from a place of malice. The Tweet that pre-plumbing, wizards would relieve themselves where they stand and vanish it has been deliberately misrepresented by a certain section of the fandom intent on destroying anything JKR produces. I think it's clear that (i) JKR was specifically referring to urination ("relieve themselves"), (ii) she didn't mean to imply that they did it in front of other people ("where you stand" does not imply in company, it merely implies that there is not a specific location you go to do it), and (iii) they would still "unzip" first.

Yet the malicious fandom has deliberately turned it into "wizards shit their pants".

It's still a regrettable addition to the universe (if JKR had thought about it a bit longer, she would know that plumbing has a long history and that it's perfectly plausible that wizards would have had it in the year 1000). But it's nowhere near as bad as people portray it to be and I do find myself irritated every time fans deliberately misrepresent it.

On the whole, I would say that 90% of the worldbuilding elements JKR has added to the HP universe post-DH have been good. That's not too bad a record.

*Frustration*

The frustration comes from the fact that I feel like JKR is wasting her talents in terms of the projects she chooses to engage in.

JKR's talent is writing novels. Specifically, writing genre fiction: mystery/adventure novels. And her greatest brainchild is the HP universe. That's a once-in-a-lifetime idea.

Yet she seems intent on spending her creative energies on projects that are outside her principal talents. Ill-advised attempts at literary fiction. Within the HP universe, average movies, poorly considered plays, and web content that was originally supposed to be an HP encyclopedia and just became a short article on a random topic once a year. None of these play to JKR's strengths and all of them disappoint because of that.

The Fantastic Beasts movies are... fine. I like the visuals, I like the worldbuilding and magic. The characters are... okay. The plot is meh. But what is absolutely clear to me is that these stories would have been infinitely better if they had been written as novels.

I remain of the view that JKR, if she sat down and wrote some novels in the HP universe, could still knock it out of the park. Certain worldbuilding elements in the FB movies show that she still has that magic worldbuilding touch. But for whatever reason, she refuses to do so. And that's frustrating.

As for her political views, she is certainly entitled to her viewpoint and entitled to promote that viewpoint if she so wishes. I do find it regrettable, however, that she uses her time in this way rather than remaining focused on creative endeavours. I don't want to speculate too much of her personal life, but I can't help but feel that constantly getting into political arguments with strangers on the internet (and on the cesspit that is Twitter, no less) cannot be JKR living her best life.

**** I think ever since DH came out, JKR has been struggling with the idea that nothing she ever does is going to eclipse Harry Potter. She's been doing everything she can to get away from the franchise that is by far is her best work.

That's entirely understandable. I can only imagine how it must feel to be the most successful author of all time and still be the recipient of endless sneers about how you've only ever written children's/genre fiction. The desire to produce something that would establish her as an author who can do more than just Harry Potter is entirely understandable.

But the thing is... it's failed. It's been over a decade now, and pretty much all her post-HP projects have not gone well. I think it may be time for JKR to make peace with the fact that she is "the Harry Potter woman" and, instead of trying to escape it, double down on it and give the people what they want: full length, properly crafted (and professionally edited) novels set within the Harry Potter universe.

** Honestly, anyone who has much experience with fanfiction comes to the realization that HP is /full/ of holes, strange logic, "problematic" aspects, and the feeling that it could have been better.

That said, if you focus on /anything/ for years and years, you will see ways to make it better.

As for the political stuff... she could do anything with her money and clout. And she has done some good things. But the trans thing... like, why are you having this fight? Why do you even give a shit? Sigh

***** Because it's tough to separate the author's opinion from the work, sometimes. It's one thing when the author isn't really present (eg - classic books where the author is deceased), but when they're still here and making very public remarks it can color everything.

As another example, I found it a lot harder to enjoy Orson Scott Card's books when I found out his real life views. It made me reconsider certain aspects of his books, put things into a new light even within the things I'd previously enjoyed - on top of making it harder to want to support him (which buying/consuming/discussing his works does).

Sometimes it's easy to divorce the author and the books. Other times... It's not.

** Harry Potter was such a huge part of my childhood, I will always love it for what it is. I can't deny though that I am massively disappointed by J.K. Rowling. It was quite a let down that the woman who gave us Hermione Granger turned out to become Pansy Parkinson in the end. I still hope she digs herself out of this hole of bigotry she has descended into.

Doesn't change that I love Harry Potter. Tolkien was a conservative catholic even for his time, yet I love every single page of his legendarium. I don't have to agree with an artist on everything to enjoy their art, especially since Harry Potter is completely free of the views she has recently begun to espouse.

For a lot of my childhood, I felt like I existed more in the books than I did in my real life. It was a massive part of my life and this has been a huge let down. I still love Harry Potter, but now, I do not love or support J. K. Rowling. I actively consume fan fiction and I would buy fan made merchandise, but I don't give her my money anymore. I know this doesn't hurt her in any way, and this isn't my goal- I just do not want to support a person who, at best, dog whistles support for people who hate people like me.

** I find her eagerness to court political controversy quite sad, particularly when it comes in the form of attacking and mocking a minority community that is literally smaller than the number of followers she has on twitter. And her insistence on playing the victim is really quite pathetic.

That said, I'll always hold a small spot in my heart for the fact that she created the HP series, which helped me get through some extremely dark times as a teenager. She gave me a safe place to escape to every day. And I will always be thankful for that.

I believe firmly that you can appreciate the output of an artist without liking or supporting the artist or their views. Particularly when it comes to fan works, I have no issue continuing to appreciate and enjoy the HP world despite Rowlings views. I'll hesitate to spend money on things that send the money back to her in the future. I imagine I'll only watch future films when I can get them second hand for example.

** As a writer, I have a generally positive view of J.K. Rowling. The overall plot structures of the /HP/ books are more than questionable, but she undoubtedly knows how to write a page-turner, and imbue her characters with a certain depth and likability; I also take a kinder view of her worldbuilding than many; it was never meant to be realistic and it is not, but not all great worldbuilding has to be in the "plausible alternative history that meticulously accounts for how the economy of centaur commodities works" category. The /HP/ universe is a deftly-brushed fantasy land that provides a backdrop for, as fanfiction demonstrates, a nearly-infinite array of possible stories, and that's got to mean something.

When it comes to what she's done with /HP/ since the release of the final books, she's as much derided here as anywhere else, especially because as fanfiction-writers, we know how it's done and are all the more able to make fun of some of her decision for the Potterverse's future --- because we /are/ able to put our money where our mouth is, and not only criticize what she did, but show the world how to do better. That being said, personally, I find the whole thing generally harmless. There are stupid decisions in her latest additions to the canonical Potterverse, sure. But there were stupid decisions in the books too, and there are some good ideas in the new material, as well. (I /like/ the eldritch Trolley Witch, dammit!)

As a person, though? Blergh. Blergh, blergh, *blergh*. Now, I don't hate her or anything, and her attitude towards fanfiction is certainly praiseworthy, so especially on this subreddit, I feel like I do have to give her props for /that/.

But... even /before/ she decided to make being awful to trans people on Twitter her new favorite hobby, there were undercurrents to her public persona which annoyed me immensely. Her tendency, once she got onto writing Book 5 or so, to believe she was writing some sort of philosophically complex masterpiece with Things To Say about Deep Topics, was certainly one of them, insofar as she had very little to back it up save making some trite parallels between her villains and the Nazis. Which isn't exactly the height of complexity. Besides that, her idea of moral complexity consists of washed-up Christian aphorisms, including some really quite poisonous ideas about courage vs. cowardice and about the topic of death. I would hesitate to give children of mine the later /HP/ books unless I had a long talk with them about taking a lot of the narrator and heroes' moral opinions with a Mount Everest-sized grain of salt.

** Honestly it boggles my mind that she wastes her time arguing with people on Twitter when she is a millonaire. I don't understand why she doesn't just amuse herself with her money and keeps her opinions to herself. It's ridiculous that she's trying to imply she's a victim of 'cancel culture' when she was the one that started posting hateful things in the first place. Maybe she thinks she is some kind of political rolemodel because of all the attention and status she's gotten from Harry Potter, but she is not. She needs to put her phone down asap.

I'll always love Harry Potter, however, this debacle with JK Rowling has definitely woken me up to problematic aspects of the universe.

'Left-wing' and 'left of centre' are two decidedly different ideologies. She's not being forced to kowtow to anyone. Out of nowhere, she decided to share her opinion on a persons word choice in an article about mensturation, and now she's facing the consequences. Harry Potter is about love and acceptance; I don't think it's strange that the readers of her works expect her to have similar views, and act in accordance with those views.

*** Hey bud! Since you deleted your other comment, I'm going to post my reply here. In your post, you brought up the point that accepting trans people would cause “sliding degeneracy” and that INCELs and pedophiles also say that they want “human rights” (which I guess by that you mean their “human right” to rape people? Which is not a human right.) Here is my reply:

INCELs and pedophiles are rapists. They actively hurt people by acting out their sexual fantasies. Their perceived “right” to act as they would like to infringes on other people's right to not be raped. This is obviously not okay.

******* ...Yes, and that's why we say people are trans/gender/. Because humans are capable of comprehending nuance and transcending biology.

******** I mean, that's fine for you to believe. But it's not scientific. And I'm not convinced by it. I'm perfectly fine with just leaving people alone though. Live and let live, etc. But if you get up in my face to demand approval, I'm going to push back.

But it is! [[https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/voices/stop-using-phony-science-to-justify-transphobia/]]

Sex and gender don't equate to the same thing. Gender roles were once formed by necessity of survival, but have since evolved along with the evolution of the forces of production and culture. Even certain chromosonal defects show that gender is not set in stone.

********* Well, as long as you're not actively discriminating against trans people or denying their right to exist I have no quarrel with you.

edit: but if you don't believe in transcending biology... fundamentally, the entire project of human civilization has been transcending biology.

***** this is complete pseudoscience.

you're linking one review paper by one author in a journal called /"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences"/ which deals with *primate* sex roles in a way that is as conjecture as it is evidence-based, and that has no relevance at all to the question being asked. it's an incomplete theoretical model! as the author themselves explains.

did you read the paper? would you be willing to tell me what relevance it has to proving that JKR is right about trans people?

scientific consensus is vastly against TERF claims.
