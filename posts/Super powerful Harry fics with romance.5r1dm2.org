** I really like Stepping Back linkffn(12317784)

A WIP, but the pairing (Harry/Bella) is just starting, and the characters are more 3D than most Super Harry fics. It is Time Travel however.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

It's really old and abandoned but I think it's pretty well written even if pretty angsty.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and The Lightning Lord)

This fits the bill rather well. Harry Potter x Daphne Greengrass, Ravenclaw/Gray/Super Harry. It's pretty good, and in my opinion is better than most Super!Harry fics if only because Harry gradually becomes Super, as opposed to /Poof/ Harry can beat Dumbledore with a twitch of his finger.

  This is a smart! Powerful! Ravenclaw! Harry; How would the wizarding world react to a Boy Who Lived who is much different from what they expected? One that is set to change the course of the magical world forever? Manipulative! Dumbledore Bashing; Weasley Bashing; Harry/Daphne
