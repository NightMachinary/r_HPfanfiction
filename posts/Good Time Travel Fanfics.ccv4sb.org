Are there any good time travel fanfics that is centered around Harry? Also, I would like the fanfics to actually have Harry meddle with time and not sit back/let events play out all over again. I have no real preference for romance, but romance should be in the stories too.


** Linkffn(Returning to the start) fits, Harry pretty much immediately takes care of Voldemort and kills all the future Death Eaters.

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.

** If you want the polar opposite of Harry letting things play out the same way again, there's a really good one where two year old Hermione single handedly wins the war a few days before Voldemort attacks the Potters: linkffn(A little child shall lead them)

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

** Linkffn(Reunion by Rorschach's Blot) is also pretty interesting. Harry goes around killing criminals as little child vigilante, Hermione does advanced physics, Luna and Susan develop spells before going to Hogwarts, and Neville defeats the Dark Lord who was thrice defied by his parents.

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.

** If you don't care too much about realistic character development and 11 year old geniuses, then HPMoR. It's got quite frequent and consisted time travel. For example, when Harry's trapped, he plans to use the time turner to rescue himself once he gets out and gets rescued by his future self. Then there's quite a few scenes and fights where he's in multiple places at once.
