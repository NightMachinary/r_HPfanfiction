Hello all,

I read some time ago a nice fic, starring Hermione maybe in fifth year. She starts to work for the dark, recruited by a Malefoy, maybe Lucius, possibly after a break-up with Ron who cheated on her. Her change of allegiance is slow and well documented. She feeds more and more important informations to the Death Eaters. It is possible that she ends up killing some Order of the Phenix people.

If you stumble upon any good Dark!Hermione, please don't hesitate to post it here in the same time !

** That sounds like an interesting premise---though doing a 180 on her morals to embrace a genocidal terrorist just because her boyfriend cheated on her seems a bit far-fetched.

Most Dark!Hermione fic is romance written by people who just don't pay attention to any part of their fic that doesn't revolve around their 'ship, unfortunately. Anyway, examples in my library:

- linkffn(Hermione Granger, Demonologist by BrilliantLady)
- linkao3(And She Shall Reign... by BeastOfTheSea), Hermione takes over the world; it's more of an outline than a fanfic, and is a bit bashy, but it does have a great passage: "[[/spoiler][It was so blindingly obvious, in retrospect, that it stunned her that she had not seen it immediately after the final demise of Voldemort. What had Dumbledore left them? Ronald had been given an indulgence to save him from his own misguided behavior, Harry had been given a relic to encourage his martyrdom, and she - she had been given Dumbledore's own youthful inspiration. Clearly, he had meant her to succeed where he had failed.]]"
- linkffn(Darkest Witch of Her Age by darkrose0510), unfortunately abandoned.

  When she was young and naive, she thought that nothing could justify slavery and the end of liberation justified any means.

  Like all children, however, she grew up, and put aside childish naivete; she came to realize that slavery was not such a bad thing - that slaves did not desire freedom, but a kind master.

  In which Hermione takes over the Wizarding World.

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete.

  Hermione was known as the brightest witch of her age, but time and circumstances would soon change that. Who will survive a brilliant mind's descent into darkness? A dark Hermione fic'.

** I know this is an old post but you might be interested in this story: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5010568/1/]]

â€‹

It's called In Too Deep, and it's about Hermione being raised as a spy by the Death Eaters after they kill her parents. She's essentially brainwashed to believe Harry's responsible for her parents' deaths. She's not super dark and it becomes a Harmony fic, but it's pretty well written imo.
