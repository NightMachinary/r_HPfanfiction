Stargate crossovers would obviously be modern day but other crossovers that take place in the future like Star Wars (even though it takes place "a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away) or Star Trek would be good too.

**** I watched firefly just so I could read this. Honestly, I was kinda underwhelmed by both. I'd say read a synopsis for the show, watch the movie (Serenity) and that should be good enough.

*** To link it just type linkffn(the havoc side of the force) and FFBot should give you the correct fic. That is only for fanfiction.net. Different sites have a different command. The full list is on the sidebar.

That looks like a good fic but it's sadly incomplete/possibly abandoned. I wanted complete fics. But thanks for the rec.
