The Goauld invade Earth in 1997, at the height of the Wizarding War. Stargate Command contacts the ICW to inform them of the attack. Their pleas are at first dismissed, until the Goauld destroy Diagon Alley, as well as other Wizarding towns. The Death Eaters join with the SGC and ICW to resist the Goauld. The Goauld unleash everything they have on their nemesis, causing the devastation of Earth.


** Does the Wizarding world gets revealed? Do they create a Wizard Alpha Site or do they join the regular Alpha Site?
