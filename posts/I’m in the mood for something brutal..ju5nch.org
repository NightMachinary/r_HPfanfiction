Includes a list of brutal fics I've already read for anyone that comes across this post. ☺️

I mean something that will absolutely rip my heart to shreds. Not romance angst, mind you (thought I don't mind a good romance), more of a war-time angst, my best friend just died fighting beside me kind of angst, or I've got to kill the person I love to save them world kind of angst. Preferably with grimdark vibes, but I'll take what I can get. Only compete fics or fics steadily updating please.

Any pairing except Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione. Unless it's an already established romance and their relationships are not the focal point.

Preferably under 150kish words, but I'll commit to something longer if it's really, really good.

Just fuck me up fam.

I've already read: - [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11248015/1/Pygmalion][Pygmalion]] - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6334630/chapters/14514247][the Sum of Their Parts]] - [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13328397/1/You-Meet-in-Paris][You Meet in Paris]] - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7548181][slythering]] - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5103614/chapters/11740079][the art of self-fashioning]] - That one fic with Lily that's pretty much a magical Holocaust - That one WBWL fic where the basilisk is a total cunt

  Since Ron got a new owl, it's only fair that Ginny gets her own pet. She adopts a big black dog.

  A trap during the Horcrux hunt sends Harry into a dimension where war has raged for 28 years. Harry must not only protect himself from Voldemort, but also from a rising new Dark Lord, the evil Ministry, a war-hardened Dumbledore... and himself. Will he find his way back home to finish his own war? COMPLETE. Currently editing fic.

** If you don't mind snarry as a semiside line, this savage serie is what you look for. I also should warn you for it's sexual explicit content involving minors. It's basically the scenario where Death Eaters take over the Hogwarts.

1. The first one is brutal, but it's still bearable.

   And Just Plain Wrong by Amanuensis

2.The second one is so sick I don't want to ever read that again. I'm serious, I was really fucked up after finishing that.

Damage Control by Juxian Tang

1. This is just Ron and Wormtail sequel, but it's not bad.

Cut With Diamond by Eodrakken

Hope you enjoy it. :)
