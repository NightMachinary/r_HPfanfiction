Can you recommend some fanfictions where after the battle harry is growing into himself, preferably where he is powerfull. idc if its in the auror dapartment or just travelling around the world. 40k+ words please


** I detest OP!Harry, but two best series which are post-war about Harry's getting on with his life are:

- “[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Nineteen Years and Beyond by Northumbrian]] (start with “Tales of the Battle” linkao3(1615616) and go on, you can return to the earlier stories later), and

- “[[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?uid=143134][Mrs Granger stories]]” (Summer goes before Winter)

  Over fifty people died at the Battle of Hogwarts. There are dozens of stories of loss, betrayal, heroism and sacrifice. These are some of those stories.

** This is probably like what you are looking for.

​

I like this sort of Fic, normally without OP harry, but can still them. Someone else has linked MRS_Grangers fics, they are good and VERY long, 500k+ words over the 2 fics.

If you have any you have read that you like ping me a PM so I can take a look :)

** You should try Loose Cannon by Manatee-vs-Walrus. There's a bait early on in the story where they “prove” that Harry isn't magically powerful, but the story then goes on to demonstrate how incorrect that is.

He quits the aurors to play for the Cannons, develops relationships (not just romantically), tries to recover from the trauma of the his life up to that point, learns new magic, broadens his horizons, tries to fix the problems with wizard into society, becomes a fashion icon, and just generally has a good time. 900k words so far, so probably long enough for you, haha.

  Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Heaps of dialogue and world-building, and OCs galore. Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. NO MORTAL PERIL.
