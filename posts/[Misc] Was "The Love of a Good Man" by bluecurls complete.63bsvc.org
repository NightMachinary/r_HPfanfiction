On their FFN profile they stated that their completed stuff moved to Granger Enchanted, and since that's down now, to AO3.

Buuut, I don't know if this story fell into the limbo of "still transferring things over" or if it was just never completed.


** I've got a copy from 2015-09-01 where last update was 2015-05-10, 8 chapters, 33205 words, from Granger Enchanted.

When you last read it, how far along was the story?

*** I didn't, it was on my list of things to read, I didn't know it was pulled until I went looking for it. And I couldn't find any info on whether it was finished or not when I went hunting for it.
