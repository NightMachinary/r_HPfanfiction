** The warlock's apprentice, serpentine, a cadmean victory, barefoot, hp and the elemental change, knowledge is power (fettuccine) and a Grindelwald's tale are some of the better ones I remember reading. Though I haven't read some of them in a while so they might be worse than I remembered. Hail Odysseus and other works by that author also tend to be enjoyable.

Edit: I forgot The Mind Arts
