#+TITLE: Unfortunately, Arabella Figg didn't make it out of the first wizarding war, and so, when baby Harry was left with the Dursleys, Dumbledore was at a loose end of who to plant in Little Whinging as a minder. Filch, Hagrid, and Professor Trelawney had all been angling for a career change lately...

Crack fic, obviously. These were the first three characters that jumped to mind, trying to avoid the old Lupin cliches. Maybe you could think up another minor character who would fit incongruously into middle-class muggle suburbia?

My immediate constraints on the prompt:

- Harry isn't immediately (or at all?) removed from the Dursleys' custody into the minder's, because the minder knows the importance of the blood wards and believes wholeheartedly in them

- The minder has to try and fit somewhat into local muggle society and avoid breaking the Statute of Secrecy, but has all of magic at their disposal to do that

- No matter how badly things go, the minder doesn't want Dumbledore to know - or think that - they've failed, because this is a big Moment for them professionally and they don't want their old career back.

Enjoy!


** So Rita Skeeter volunteers. At this point in her life she is still not known for her /sharp/ quill. She builds her career by reporting on the treatment Harry receives from his relatives. One day Vernon opens the door to find an angry mob waiting for him on his lawn.

** Filch. He's grumpy and old and has just as many cats as Ms. Figg did. He trudges around his house, and wheezes and complains.

At least he doesn't smell of cabbages.
