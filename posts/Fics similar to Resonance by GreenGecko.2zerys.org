I love this fic and its sequels, especially the post Hogwarts auror training. Are there any other good, long, preferably complete similar stories? Thanks.


** /(spoilers)/ [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567][Temporal Beacon]] could be compared to it in a sense that where Gecko's story goes sideways (playing with dimensions), willyolioleo's goes up and back down (playing with time travel). Not sure if it fits well enough with your request.

The story is 428,826 WL and, unfortunately, abandoned.

*** Thanks, unfortunately that's one part of the series that really annoyed me though.
