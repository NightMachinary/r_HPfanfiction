** Scabbers: 1: Fair enough 2: Irrelevant to Ron's fights with Hermione and also no one actually blames Ron for not noticing as the only ones who could have were his brothers and Harry who had the marauders map 3: Ron and Percy didn't have any right or special permission as far as we know that they could bring a rat in as it wasn't on the approved pets list. Cats. Eat. Rats. And cats are allowed when Rats are not.

Yule Ball: 1: Again, fair enough. 2: That's just a person's opinion of Krum and might not be shared, also that part is irrelevant. And it's Ron's own fault which people like yourself have rightly called him out on. 3: Whole heartedly agree on this point. Disgusting.

Lavender: 1: Not an excuse. Childish 2: If you're talking about the confundus charm, then yeah, that is fair and correct. 3: It's not up to Harry to tell Hermione. If she needed to know, she would have asked or not found out if it wasn't her business. 4, 5 and 6: All fair and justified

DH abandonment: 1: Can be argued that he could have taken blood replenishing potions. Otherwise, sort of fair. 2: It is unlikely that he was complaining about lack of food for recovery, given his previous years at Hogwarts overeating and gorging. What Harry said was right to some degree, he knew or should have known what he was signing up for. 3: Applies to the previous point as well, but he was not injured then. If he was, he wouldn't have been able to apparate successfully away from the tent. 4: Unfair as Harry and Hermione to some extent also had family, in the Weasley's and Hermione's parents as she did not know if Voldemort could find them. Also he didn't know if all seven family members in Britain were actively fighting/defying death eaters and Voldemort. 5: When exactly are his feelings belittled? And for what stuff he (rarely) achieves he is rewarded e.g Ron getting Pigwidgeon after helping Sirius escape, getting a new broom and hence onto the quidditch team because he got the prefect position (which if it didn't go to Harry should have gone to Neville as he was in far less trouble and would have done better in those duties) etc.

Romione: 1: Your opinion. (One I do not share. Harmony only for me) 2: Hermione would not have liked Harry or Krum because of either of those facts. Case in point the goblet of fire. Hermione didn't care about Krum for quidditch and Harry wasn't her friend because he was the ‚Äòsaviour of the Wizarding world' 3: While yes, they have Harry in common, it was never proved that Ron was actually the thing that Harry would miss most, especially considering his half-assed apology after the Dragon task. Dumbledore and the other judges decided who he would miss most for Harry. 3b: What are you talking about?! When Ron wasn't interrupting and complaining about lack of food or whining about other pointless bulls***, Harry and Hermione figured out how to destroy the horcruxes with the sword, that the sword in Dumbledore's office was a fake, found Nagini, and found the real sword hidden in a lake. 3c: They can hang out without Harry as friends but that doesn't mean they're going to start snogging every time he is away. 4: They balance each other out because Ron is nearly as normally thick as Harry is dense when it comes to relationships, and Hermione is too smart for both of them tbh. Also they share no common interests or traits. Find one that doesn't relate to Harry, go on. I'll wait. 5: When it comes to family, yes you are correct. But when it comes to say apologies or showing even an ounce of caring, well I'll sum it up in a quote directly from the Goblet of Fire just after Harry has beaten a dragon at it's own game and taken the golden egg

‚Äò ‚ÄúHarry,‚Äù he said, very seriously, ‚Äúwhoever put your name in that Goblet - I - I reckon they're trying to do you in!‚Äù It was as though the last few weeks had never happened - as though Harry was meeting Ron for the first time, right after he had been made champion. ‚ÄúCaught on, have you?‚Äù said Harry coldly. ‚ÄúTook you long enough.‚Äù Hermione stood nervously between them, looking from one to the other. Ron opened his mouth uncertainly. ‚Äò Hmm, really sounds compassionate and heartfelt, don't you think? In case it wasn't obvious, that was sarcasm. Also the line after where Harry miraculously forgives him is just utter bs. A fourteen year old who was betrayed by his best friend and also has only one other person besides the adults in the castle that doesn't hate his guts would not publicly approve of such a weak facsimile of an apology.

Found that common trait or interest that Hermione and Ron share yet? No? I thought so.

***** Yeah fan fiction does that.

In the books hardy never shows any romantic feelings for Hermione. Even from the first book it's always Ron who cares more about her. It's shown again and again and especially in DH. Harry and Ginny are arguable but Ron and Hermione's relationship develops over seven books.

Honestly most if not all harmony shippers formed those opinion ls after the movies (Ron was actually more popular and liked than Hermione before the movies). Steve Kloves made movie Hermione a flawless goddess and gave all of Ron's character developing lines to Hermione.

The books paint a much different story than the movies.

All I can tell is look past the hot actors and look at the actual characters in the book. You'll understand why Ron and Hermione work better than harmony.

****** Blatantly untrue. Harmony is one of the oldest ships in the fandom and there are so many who started shipping them before the movies even came out. I don't particularly love the movies and don't consider Emma and Dan as the characters when I read the books.

All 7 books show a clear bond of trust, understanding, and love between Harry and Hermione. For me, those actions and interactions have always shown the deepest connection in the books. If you have another interpretation of the books that's fine, but don't go around making grand generalizations with this superior tone, as if other people aren't allowed to read the books and come to different conclusions. As if the only possible reason people disagree with you is because they follow the movies and not the books.

It invalidates your whole argument and makes you come across as rather judgmental and close minded.

#+begin_quote
  ‚ÄòCome on, Hermione, come and have some food,' Harry said, looking over at Ron and wondering whether he was in a good enough mood to bury the hatchet.

  ‚ÄòI can't, Harry, I've still got four hundred and twenty-two pages to read!' said Hermione, now sounding slightly hysterical. ‚ÄòAnyway ...' she glanced over at Ron, too, ‚Äòhe doesn't want me to join in.'

  There was no arguing with this, as Ron chose that moment to say loudly, ‚ÄòIf Scabbers hadn't just been eaten, he could have had some of these Fudge Flies, he used to really like them --'

  Hermione burst into tears. Before Harry could say or do anything, she had tucked the enormous book under her arm, and, still sobbing, run towards the staircase to the girls' dormitories and out of sight.

  ‚ÄòCan't you give her a break?' Harry asked Ron quietly.

  ‚ÄòNo,' said Ron flatly.

************* Man I just got tired of replying to dunderheads like you who seemingly forget every good quality Ron has in favour of making Harry and Hermione seem like saints. They are flawed characters, all three of them, the ungodly amount of hate Ron gets is unjustified. You guy's seemed to forget that Ron actually grew as a character. And in DH he even console and comforts Hermione when she cries. That boy was willing to give his life to save Hermione from torture and you guys make him seem like some emotionless buffoon. I just hate bashing. I hate it when even when the characters themselves forgive ron, you guys can't. He's not a useless character. I may get defensive over him because I relate to him in many ways. Low self-esteem, no appreciation extra. You know I made a point about his achievements being overshadowed. So he wins the quidditch cup 2 times in 5th and 6th year, both times either one or both his friends aren't there. Out of all the people in the stadium he seeks validation from the people he loves the most, but they aren't there. You might see Ron as a Jealous or greed or hurtful. But I see a character trying to make himself better, a character that has as actual ark. The boy you see at the beginning of the 1st book isn't the same person as the one who you see standing at the platform with his and Hermione's kids 19 years after the war. Without flawed characters this story does exist. People tend to make out harry and Hermione to be some kinds of Mary Sues but in the books they are actually flawed, they too just like ton don't make the best decisions sometimes. They were kids after all. We tend to forget that.

#+begin_quote
  why this Fandom hates Ron Weasley or why sometimes fails to even acknowledge he exists
#+end_quote

Because he's a normal character in a series about extraordinary people and magic. He's a lazy, but above average student. However, he doesn't have a talent. Harry has Quidditch and defense. Neville has herbology. Harry, Hermione, and Neville have big moments that overshadow their flaws. Ron doesn't. Nevermind his biggest moment was in the 1st book.

Ron doesn't solve the puzzles. Harry and Hermione do and DH narration points this out:

#+begin_quote
  ‚ÄúSo where next?‚Äù was his constant refrain.

  He did not seem to have any ideas himself, but expected Harry and Hermione to come up with plans while he sat and brooded over the low food supplies.

  Accordingly Harry and Hermione spent fruitless hours trying to decide where they might find the other Horcruxes...
#+end_quote

Ron is supposed to be the "faithful sidekick" archetype and he fits that for the 1st 3 books, but GoF begins a fall he doesn't really recover from. Sorry, but "he believed you'd come back" or whatever Harry says is insufficient.

TL; DR Fandom doesn't like that Ron is too normal and that's JKR's fault.

He needs someone who appreciates him for him and won't outshine him which lavender and luna do. Hermione would never settle for Ron.

I don't believe anyone who was bullied for 5 years by a friend would date much less marry that fool. Harry doesn't make her cry. Even in DH he comforts Hermione while Ron is the cause and perpetrator of her pain.

Attacking someone for your own mistake isn't justifiable. Ron could have avoided the whole thing by locking his pet. His pet isn't even regulation. There are far more cats in Hogwarts than rats so Ron should have been careful considering a cat preys on rats.

Ron never grows. He always remains a petty boy throughout even DH. He never sacrifices for the Trio. He is the freeloader while Harmony do the brunt of the work.

You see a young woman sitting alone reading a book that most 7th years would find difficult to understand. Given your experiences in the past you would not automatically assume that she was a 4th year regardless of her stature. And again I must point out a 3 year difference in what is essentially high school is nothing. Arguing that it is is the same as parents who hate their daughters slightly older bf and the day he turns 18 they call the police even though most places have a preexisting relationship law. But I digress. What we have here is the same mentality as bashing ron. There is nothing in canon to suggest Krum is anything other than honorable.

Which indicates that he wasn't the type to use his fame to break up a happy couple for his jollies.

  1) Hermione didn't try to control her pet from eating her best friends pet even after numerous warnings
#+end_quote

Hermione has a cat. Ron has a rat. Of these two pets, which one of them commonly lives in a cage? Hint: It is not the cat.

Ron's rat is described variously as being in his bookbag, his pocket or just randomly free-roaming around the boy's dormitory. That is not a healthy or safe way to keep a rat that isn't also an animagus and therefore much smarter than your average rat.

Should Hermione have brought Crookshanks into the boy's dorm? No.

Of the two pets, is Scabbers the one that could and should be kept in a cage? Yes.

If I'm walking my dog off leash and my dog runs in front of a car and dies that's my fault. If my cat is an outdoor cat and it gets killed by a wild animal that's my fault. If I let my small furry and/or slithery animal roam around unsupervised or transport it improperly and it dies, guess whose fault that is? Mine. As the human who has chosen to care for an animal, I have a responsibility to care for that animal to the best of my ability or find someone else who will. That includes appropriately protecting it from dangers.

Hermione is not particularly sympathetic about the whole situation but frankly, the whole situation could have been solved by keeping Scabbers in a cage in the boys dorm.

Also.

  A beam of light fell across the grass, hit the bottom of a tree and illuminated its branches; there, crouching amongst the budding leaves, was Crookshanks. ‚ÄòGet out of it!' Ron roared, and he stooped down and seized a stone lying on the grass, but before he could do anything else, Crookshanks had vanished with one swish of his long ginger tail. ‚ÄòSee?' Ron said furiously, chucking the stone down again. ‚ÄòShe's still letting him wander about wherever he wants -- probably washing down Scabbers with a couple of birds now ...'
#+end_quote

Hurting someone else's pet in defence of your own pet - that's perfectly reasonable. Nearly throwing a stone at a cat who is doing absolutely nothing. Not reasonable.

  1) He basically had to wear rags while the twins and even Ginny got half decent dress robes.
#+end_quote

We don't know anything like this. In book canon, we never get a description of either the twins robes or Ginny's. Mrs Weasley delivers wrapped parcels with dress robes in them. Also, Ginny was a third year, why would Molly buy her dress robes when she didn't have to until they knew for certain that Ginny had been asked to the ball?

#+begin_quote
  1) Ginny practically virgin-shamed him
#+end_quote

And he tries to jinx her? I'm not sure what your point is

#+begin_quote
  2) Hermione does hide a very big thing from him, one she knows will affect him.
#+end_quote

She might or might not have kissed someone two years previously? They're not even dating, who she might or might not have kissed has nothing to do with him.

Damn, I always forget about this. Throwing stones at animals? Come on, Ron.

** I think [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/review-of-escape-and-mr-and-mrs-percy-weasley.html][there are no rational reasons]], people just have tendency to turn around everything good in the original books to evil. See that post for my longer version of the argument.

** In the Yule Ball bit, did you mean ‚Äúsnagging‚Äù or ‚Äúshagging‚Äù? If you mean ‚Äúsnagging‚Äù, Ron waited until the last minute to ask Hermione. If you mean ‚Äúshagging‚Äù, could you point me a quote or chapter?

Edit: I really hate fics that have excessive Ron bashing. They make him out to be this terrible person, and make the rest of the characters essentially have no flaws whatsoever. Everyone in the book has strengths and flaws, and I think many fics over look this.
