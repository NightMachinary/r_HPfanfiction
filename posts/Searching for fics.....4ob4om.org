Searching for fics like 'Midnight Gold The Rise of The Forgotten Lord ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7694530/1/Midnight-Gold-The-Rise-Of-The-Forgotten-Lord]])

Basically fics where Harry is intelligent and is involved with making money and the financial part of the wizarding world. Cheers for any suggestions :)

Sorry about the formatting, I'm on phone atm


** Well, if you don't mind a dark, criminal Harry, you might like this longish one-shot: linkao3(Business by esama)

  Where there is a Moriarty, there must also be a Holmes. Now let's see if she is up to the task. AN: Based on 'Business' by esama. Reading that first is required to understand the story.

**** Uh, close, but not precisely what I was going for. (Didn't know there was a continuation, but now I do, so that's nice.)

The ID number on it should be more precise, I hope. linkao3(1113588)
