I'm pretty sure in this fic during the fight at the department of mysteries Harry almost fell into the veil going after Sirius, to stop him Ron and Hermione try to hold onto him and Hermione casts a spell that causes them to always have to be touching at any given time. This eventually leads to the trio getting together romantically.

** KetchupKK has the right name for the fic.

The scene you specifically mention happens in the last third of the second chapter.

*** this fic is gross. golden trio gets stuck together with a spell and literally 24 hours later in story there's explicit fifteen year olds fingerfucking hermione in a bath because i guess that's how people work? a teen girl would just let herself get fingerbanged by two guys in a bath just because they're stuck together. she wouldn't hate it, or tell them to turn away. nobody has any problems with it. let's just have sex because we're stuck together i guess. ridiculous and disgusting.

**** If the story is meant to be porn, then that's a downright modest logical leap. Most HP porn involves teenagers screwing all over the castle for basically no reason at all.

**** So, I've never actually read the story beyond the second chapter and didn't realize this. After skimming through it you're right and I'll remove the direct link.
