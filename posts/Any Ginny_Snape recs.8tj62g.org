** Since so many Ginny haters equate her with Lily Evans, the lack of Ginny/Snape fics is surprising.

I think it's even possible that Voldemort initially had dastardly plans for Ginny, considering her relationship with Harry. But Snape stepped in and told Voldemort that he wanted Ginny for himself, so Voldemort backtracked and left Ginny alone. Then in front of other Death Eaters, Voldemort made fun of Snape saying he had a thing for redheads, but that he made a better choice this time by picking a pureblood.

*** Really, what's with the Ginny haters? Yeah, her character is kind of two dimensional in the books, but that's why it's fun to flesh her character out in fanfiction.

Interesting idea! Yeah, Voldie's plans for her were thwarted.

**** Lots of people from places where redheads are rare think Ginny is just another copy of Lily and that H/G pairing is something of Oedipus Complex.

***** Ohhh interesting. That's possible...but maybe it has something to do with Rowling being a redhead? For some reason I thought that she was redheaded as a child.

Honestly, I like the idea that he becomes a Weasley because he didn't grow up with a loving family. His best friend becomes his brother (a redheaded family).

****** In most of places of the world (Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Southern Europe), red haired people are indeed extremely rare. I think it's an inherent human bias to consider ethnic groups they aren't familiar with as â€˜look like the same'. When I had worked in China as an expat, I had plenty of people there confusing me with someone else from my ethnicity.

But in Britain, red haired people can make up to 10% of the population.

In the Books of course, there is absolutely no indication that Ginny and Lily resemble each other physically. Personality wise, Lily has more in common with Hermione anyway, from the little tidbit we know about Lily.

******* Yeah, when I was in Japan people asked if I was from Brazil lol. I'm mixed race.

So you're saying if I move to Britain I'll have a better chance of marrying a redhead?! :D

Lily seems to have a similar temper and bravery as Ginny, but I see what you mean about the intelligence and analytical mind being similar to Hermione.

***** I was reading the books before the movies came out, so in my mind the actors are separate from the characters.

Well...except for Alan Rickman lol.

******* Wow, really?! That would make me happy if it's true. <3

The most disappointing casting was for Lupin. :( David Thewlis is an awesome actor, though.

** This fic is kiiiinda Ginny/Snape (also Ginny/Draco), and surprisingly good in spite of that (not gonna lie, the idea of this pairing generally creeps me out): [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/ginnysdarkside/SDIWIWIS.html]]

*** I think Snape generally creeps people out, so it's okay lol. He's my favorite character though. Thank you! I think I've seen this fic mentioned before. I'll check it out.
