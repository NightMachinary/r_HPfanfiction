** linkao3(11827911) is one of my favorite fics. I am actually not really a fan of drarry in general but this is so so good.

There are sexual situations but no smut. If I remember correctly some shirts come off and there is heavy making out but nothing further than that (and it's not between harry and draco). It's genuinely used as a plot device and isn't gratuitous.
