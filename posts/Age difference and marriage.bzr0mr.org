Is it just me or every fiction with Harry/older woman everybody have problem with age difference even if it's just a few years (Harry/Fleur is 3), but if it's Bill/Fleur or Remus/Tonks everybody is ok? Also why do they marry so young?


** Search me, I never understood either. There's no reason for them to marry so young when they live at least 30 years longer than Muggles.

*** A bunch of reasons. Firstly Hogwarts, the classes aren't huge, chances are, if they marry someone within a few years of age then they've known each other for years. Harry is the exception rather than the rule with how anti-social he is. Population size is a factor, if you're going to marry another magical rather than muggle, chances are you met them already. JKR maths is off, we all know that, but if you marry domestically in HP to another magical there is a very high chance you met them at Hogwarts. Compare that to how couples meet in our world. There are millions of us muggles in each country. Its one of the reasons I'm not a big fan of stories that imply all of Hogwarts was getting off in broom closets. Everyone knows everyone and everyone knows who did what with whom. Everyone is somebody's ex/cousin/best friend.

Another reason is Voldemort, people were dying, now or never was a very real pressure. Grindelwald was only a few years before him too.

Lily and James fill both of these. They knew each other and lived around each other for years. Longer than most couples are together before they get married. Then they jumped right into fighting Voldemort, people they knew were dying, they had to have known they could die any day and they wanted to make the most of what they had. Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione both fit this too, they knew each other for years they were close and then more.

Young marriages aren't a guarantee either. Tonks didn't marry right out of Hogwarts, Bill must have been nearing 30, Charlie Weasley never marries and Percy doesn't marry right out of school. Kingsley, Mundungus Fletcher and Moody are never mentioned to have married, nor are many other of the Order members. It seems those close to the central plot marry young but the rest of the Wizarding world doesn't always.

** A number of reasons that I can hypothesize (in order of impact):

First, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_disparity_in_sexual_relationships#Reasons_for_age_disparity][this article]] might help you understand that marriage on average favors near parity ages up to men being five years the elder, with only 10% being such a reverse of situations. Its not that common for women to be older in general, and generally rarity often makes people notice (and have problems with) such marriages.

Second, Harry and Hermione (as well as SI OCs) are to many people the character they imagine themselves as. From a societal point of view, at least in a lot of western culture, there is a not inconsiderable stigma against large age differences between men and women in relationships/marriage. Some of this is because of the possible idea of one taking advantage of the other for (often for money, e.g. "gold digger"). Thats not to say its even a common issue, but its part of the why people generally are inclined to frown on such relationships (accurate or not). Thus, people are uncomfortable with "their character" doing things they find wrong on a personal level.

Third, from a story perspective, the Bill/Fleur and Remus/Tonks situations are kind of black sheep in wizarding society. Considering that nearly every British wizard is educated at Hogwarts (for the full seven years), its likely that you are going to school with if not in the same age bracket as your future spouse(s?). More so, considering puberty and relationship interest usually kicks in around 12-14, this probably limits the number even further. Bill lived in a separate country for years, so relationships were probably difficult at best, while Remus was forced to the fringes of society with his only likely candidates probably less than reputable individuals. And, related to the first answer, both of these are also older men with younger women.

I don't see that much of a problem myself, but these seem to be the best explanations.

*** Until 1875, the age of consent in England was 12. Considering how the Wizarding World seems slower to change socially than Muggle society, at least partially due to the significantly longer lifespan of wizards and witches, one has to wonder what the legal age was when Harry Potter was at Hogwarts. It makes all the fanfic pairings in the first few years of Hogwarts even creepier if you think about it.

***** In the US, age of majority at 21, but age of consent ranges from 16-18. In England, age of majority is 18, but age of consent is 16. In Europe, age of majority is generally 18, where as age of consent ranges from 14-16 (except for Cyprus (17), Ireland (17), Turkey (18) and Vatican City (18)).

In England historically, age of consent was 12 until 1875, 13 until 1885, and 16 since then, whereas the age of majority was 21 until it was reduced to 18 in 1969.

In the 1800s, the US's age of majority was 21, but age of consent ranged from 10-12 (except for Delaware which was 7 - yikes...)

So I would expect that the age of consent in the Wizarding world to most likely be a number of years before the age of majority. If we go by modern times, it would probably be 2-4 years. If we are going by the norm during 1800s, it would probably be more than that - probably 5-7 years, which would put age of consent at 10-12. Considering that Wizarding children are walking around with (potentially) lethal weapons at age 11, I wouldn't be surprised if the age of consent was the same.

***** Well, Remus and Tonks are, according to the laws of the wizarding world, both adults. This is /not/ the case with Harry and Fleur as of /GoF/, since (assuming that Dumbledore's comment about coming of age in "the wizarding world" applies to the wizarding community worldwide) she, at 17, is legally an adult, and he is not. There are therefore potentially unfortunate implications that are absent in the case of Remus/Tonks.

The Wizarding World is often viewed as being behind the muggle world socially/culturally/technologically.

Depending on how quickly social change occurs in the Wizarding world vs the muggle one, it is quite possible that both of the previous examples would be legal (and possibly even socially acceptable).

The things like candles, robes, steam trains - they're purely cosmetic. Rowling used them to give the school a more magical feel.

Wizards are vastly more advanced technologically compared to muggles - they have spells that output energy indefinitely. This is something that's not there now, in 2019. They can teleport vast distances, they can make mountains of food out of a morsel, and they can heal and cure almost every single ailment.

James and Sirius used mirrors to talk to each other in the 70s - that's like video calling about 30 years before it became a thing.

There is literally no comparison in technology between the wiz world and the muggle one. They're miles ahead.

****** You're right - there's no comparison in technology between the wizarding world and the muggle world.

They have no internet. They have no computers. Their information storage, search, and retrieval technology is medieval. THEY HAVE NO MEANS OF SHARING CAT VIDEOS!!!!!!

Their entertainment is limited to a few radio stations and live performances. They have no TVs, no movie theatres, no game consoles. To watch a sporting event, you have to go to it and sit in the stands.

Wizards haven't been to the moon. They haven't landed rovers on Mars. They haven't sent probes out of our solar system. They aren't working towards manned settlements on other planets.

Their weapons are slow, inaccurate, and require years of training to be used at all. They haven't harnessed the power of the atom and sun to make weapons capable of destroying whole cities nor threatened to depopulate the entire world.

Yes - James and Sirius used mirrors to talk to each other in the 70s. They are also the only people we see use them and that was limited to a single pair of mirrors. There is no worldwide network of mirrors for them to link into. Most people use owls or flue calls and neither of those match the speed and convenience of cell phones.

Some of them can teleport vast distances. Most of them can't Apparate or dislike it, dislike the spinning of portkeys, and rely on the flue network and brooms to get around.

Their rate of development is glacial in comparison to muggles. Muggles have advanced more in the last 50 years then Wizards have in the last 500.

Yes - in many ways Wizards are vastly superior. But that superiority is shrinking everyday.

Why is it even in those fics somehow OK for Remus and Tonks to end up together? He's known her for her entire life. It's freaky.

** I don't have an answer for the age difference issue, but for the getting married early one, Wizarding youth are functionally adults as soon as they graduate Hogwarts at 17 or 18. There is no higher education, so people are evidently expected to get jobs and start their lives right out of Hogwarts.

It's definitely evident in my grandparent's generation that the lack of higher education and a need to start building a life young leads to young marriages. I would expect that, with the exception of people taking on apprenticeships or doing jobs that require several years of training, like auroring or curse breaking, most Hogwarts students get married within three or four years of graduating.

** The age difference is always mentioned because Harry is either underage or very near and Tonks/Narcissa/McGonagall etc. are normally well into being adults. It's like how the half your age plus 7 rule gives more flexibility to older couples.

As to why they marry young, this is fiction and that is the zenith of the fictional relationship that most authors aim towards. Additionally, people idolise marriage and believe that, if it can be achieved, it solves all relationship problems rather than leaving you with the same problems and an incredibly powerful legal binding to the person you have problems with.

** Wizards have a lifespan at least double that of muggles even in canon. Makes sense they'd have a different idea of what constitutes a noteworthy age difference.

** If a young man is successful he can marry someone his own age or younger and have several children, meanwhile, a young man and an older woman can't. Therefore men marrying older women is generally seen as socially undesirable and is generally disapproved of.

Additionally, when Harry and Fleur meet Fleur is somewhere around 17 and Harry 14. 14 year olds are little kids, and Fleur expressed this view in GoF when she learned that Harry was in the tournament. A 14-year old has been a teenager for a year or two, while a 17 year old has been one for 4-5.

Similarly, if Remus and Tonks met at 35 and 22 respectively they had been adults, in the wizard sense, for 18 and 5 years respectively.

To answer the final question: because that's when they become adults. IRL it's a major social problem that education and the early stages of careers drag on for so long as they do these days.
