** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home]] is my favorite story. Unfortunately it seems to be abandoned. :(

It's a fem-Harry time travel, but not your standard redo, as Jasmine stays away from her past and allows it to happen.

** If you've been in this sub for a while, you've probably seen me post this somewhere before, but here it is again.

My Top HP 10 Fics: a copypasta.

Most of these are either Hinny, Peggy Sues or both.

1.  Hiatus/Abandoned: Meaning of One by Sovran [[http://www.siye.co.uk/series.php?seriesid=54]] is my favourite fic, period. It's a Hinny soul bond fic, which is rightfully a turn off for many people, but Sovran takes the idea and makes a gripping and emotional retelling of Hogwarts. Every character feels as if they have been ripped straight from canon while allowing for further intricacy and depth. The bond itself isn't prone to being trashy and tropey like similar stories, while Harry and Ginny do become fast friends, their developing relationship is tactful, believable and ultimately wholesome as hell. The bond's mechanics are developed early and have a complete set of pros and cons that don't derail the story into wish-fulfillment, it even addresses puberty in a way that is in-depth yet mature and reasonable. Seriously, I could and have gushed and gushed about this fic for hours, so I'll stop myself now.

2.  Ongoing: Before I read, Meaning of One, Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past by Viridian [[https://viridian.fanficauthors.net/harry%5C_potter%5C_and%5C_the%5C_nightmares%5C_of%5C_futures%5C_past/index/][https://viridian.fanficauthors.net/harry\_potter\_and\_the\_nightmares\_of\_futures\_past/index/]] was my favourite fic. It's a Peggy Sue in which Harry won the war, but Britain and everyone in it died in the process. Essentially he cast the killing curse on himself in order to go back to 1991. It's an emotional story in which Harry questions his moral integrity for, in his eyes, manipulating the younger versions of his friends like Fanon!Dumbledore.

3.  Ongoing: Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay by Saphroneth [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-is-a-dragon-and-thats-okay-hp-au-crack.731548/reader/]] linkffn(13230340) was my introduction to HP fanfics, since I was reading Saphroneth's other works before then. And it's a good introduction. It's a crack story where Harry is a dragon. Not a dragon animagus an actual dragon. The idea is taken to its logical and hilarious extremes that somehow still make perfect sense. Original plotlines are derailed constantly, only for a new slice-of-life comedy to take its place that adheres to and closely examines canon and side-content to come to new and innovative conclusions. Starring: a Black-Backed Bookwyrm, a club of "Oddly Shaped Students," Astronaut!Ron, Neville whacking things with an iron pipe, Velociraptor!Hermione, the best interpretation of Dumbledore ever, and a very confused Draco.

4.  Finished: This goddamn cryfest by The Seeker. Saving Harry [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127417]] takes all the abuse that Harry went through in canon and analyses what a child in that situation may have ended up like. It is pure Hinny hurt/comfort injected into your veins, and absolutely heartbreaking. Luckily, the ending isn't tragic, so you're not endlessly wallowing in sadness.

5.  Ongoing: Inspired by linkffn(10610076) Time To Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is by Tsume Yuki, ravenclawblues' The Heir Of House Black linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20459714/chapters/48544922]]) is another Peggy Sue, however Harry is born as Turais Black, the elder brother to Sirius and Regulus. If you've read Galleons, it's a far more in depth version of that, going into the events of each year, that really emulates the style of canon with mysteries. The original characters are memorable and provide interesting parallels to canon. It's just an overall good quality fic.

6.  Ongoing: Now for something that isn't Hinny, but Drarry. The Time Twister series [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/670418]] starting with Draco Malfoy and the Resurrection Stone linkao3(10021610) by YouAreMyHappilyEverAfter. It's a Draco Malfoy Peggy Sue from after the war where he regrets everything he did and goes back in time to be friends with Harry and help him out. Only it turns out to be a lot more friendly than he intended. What I love about the fic is just all the wholesome feels that come from it.

7.  Abandoned: I love the concept of Forced Maturity by pseudonym. [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127442]] It's a post-Half-Blood Prince Harry Peggy Sue, but the twist is that Harry loses all his memories of the future. So he's got all of 16-year-old Harry's magical abilities, muscle memory, and emotional associations, with no explanation as to why he has any of them. There are a couple things I take issue with like the whole age line thing and the fact it's abandoned after the end of CoS. I mostly love it for the idea which has plenty more room for exploration, and the Hinny because I'm trash.

8.  Ongoing: Magical Metamorphosis by Eon_the_Dragon_Mage linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11063298/chapters/24670002]]) is a Transgirl Harry or “Holly” fic that I think is the best of its kind. The fic actually goes in depth on the Trans experience, focusing on gender dysphoria, the reactions of the Hogwarts students and general public, and the struggle it takes to achieve a trans person's preferred body. Also the fic has the absolute miracle of creating a good and friendly relationship between Holly and Rita Skeeter. As in, they even go shopping together. It's surreal yet makes perfect sense.

9.  Ongoing: PadfootIsMyHomeDawg's Parsel linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6146470/chapters/14082718]]) is a story where instead of going to the Dursley's, Harry, dubbed Silas, leaves the doorstep in the morning of November First in a snake animagus form to live among other snakes. After he has been missing for 10 years, he's discovered by Fred and George in the Forbidden Forest. It's a Harmony fic, cute as heck, and a cool exaggeration of Harry being a fish out of water, having to learn magic and how to be human at the same time.

10. Finished: In Care Of by Fang's Fawn, linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4927160/1/In-Care-Of]]) is a fic where Harry finds an injured bat in the Dursley's back garden and decides to nurse it back to health. What he doesn't know, is that the bat is actually Snape. A heartbreaking story about Severus learning about how spoilt Harry really is, and he's pissed at it all.

  It was the year 2003 and Wizarding Britain was finally starting to heal from the wounds of the Second Wizarding War. However, a growing number of Dark wizarding activities across Europe and political impasse in the Wizengamot threatened to destroy the fragile society once and for all. But who was the enemy? Was it just the remnant supporters of Voldemort or was it the rise of a new Dark Lord? 23-year-old Deputy Head Auror Harry Potter tried to get to the bottom of this mystery but there was simply not enough time. There was simply nothing he could do to save the world at this point... Unless he could go back in time and stem the tides... This is a journey of family, of friendship, of self-discovery, and, as always with Harry Potter, a healthy dose of world-saving.(Master of Death Harry Potter/ Rebirth/ Time Travel Fix-It/ Marauders Era)Weekly to biweekly updates on Friday/ Saturday. Inspired by Tsume Yuki's "Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is" and with her expressed permission, this is the author's fiction re-imagined.Link: [https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10610076/1/Time-to-Put-Your-Galleons-Where-Your-Mouth-Is]

  This is it. This is the end of it all.Draco Lucius Malfoy has survived the Second Wizarding War and has been miraculously kept from going to Azkaban. The Aurors have his wand while he's on parole, but at least he's a free man. Free to do whatever he wants, including go to Diagon Alley where people shun him at best and throw curses and slurs at worst.Draco made the wrong decisions. He doesn't belong in this world anymore, this world he helped to create. When he finds a way to go back to when it all began, he realizes this isn't the end.This is just the beginning.UPDATE : Vietnamese translation now available!! Thank you, ChunyuPink!!!

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/285498][boy with a scar]] on ao3 is so good, independent one shots of what-if scenarios (like good dursley's, or no bwl).

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8045114/1/A-Marauder-s-Plan][marauders plan]] Where sirius comes back for harry at the end of 3rd year.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879852/chapters/1692695][turn]] A drarry fanfic where harry gets a glimpse of a universe where Malfoy turned to their side (I'm not doing the story justice, it's amazing)

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][the arithmancer]] In which Hermione is a math genius, and starts on arithmancy and spell learning early on. A wonderful fic with a brilliant, yet still human, Hermione.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12473874/1/][Things in Common]] Where Ginny is sorted into slytherin, but doesn't remain the gryffindor type girl she does in other fics with this trope. It's similar to the Changeling that was recommended earlier, but her outlook on her family is much different.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]] Where Harry becomes a dark lord to fight discrimination that would harm Teddy, but without the bashing and super Harry

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6413108/1/][To Shape and Change]] In which Snape goes back in time to prepare Harry for what is coming next. It's a bit canon divergent, but very easy to follow and very heartfelt with a good strong plot

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/][The Pureblood Pretense]] A female Harry goes to Hogwarts in disguise in order to achieve her dream of being a potions mistress. I'm not doing the story justice, the work is wonderfully done.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12783124/1/][Rewriting Destiny]] Hermione and Draco go back in time, but not as theirselves. Instead, they're reborn as siblings to those in the Marauders Generation as a way to bring about change. I'm probably explaining it more confusing than it is, the summary probably does a better job. But it's wonderful and well written.

I have so many more, so if you enjoy the ones I recommended, feel free to message me for more!!!

** A bunch of fics of various kinds.

linkffn(Backward with Purpose) My first experience (after hpmor) with HP fanfiction. It's a good fic, and a primer of do-over, or the "Peggy Sue" trope. Harry, Ron and Ginny travels back in time, redoing the canon events after the first go-around went very awry.

linkffn(Delenda Est) The best fic of its kind I've read (at least the first half). Harry falls back in time to a time period before Bellatrix, turns into her canon self, ultimately changing her fate. Includes Harry teaching the Marauders (and Lily, Severus, and the rest of the gang of the era). Puts major focus on the First War.

linkffn(A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles) Follows the life of Severus Snape, from shortly before he is born, to his end in Deathly Hallows in a mostly canon-compilant manner. While I consider a few events implausible (the author tries a bit too hard to excuse his actions at times, especially towards Harry), it's a great fic of its kind.

I can link more specific things (especially if you're interested in fics featuring Severus Snape as a major character) if you're interested. These recommendations were done to basically serve as "entry-level" fics of their kind -- simple fics that doesn't stray too far from the norm, beyond what is expected of it.

Here's some more that I've liked.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13133746/1/Daphne-Greengrass-and-the-Importance-of-Intent]] my favorite Harry/Daphne fic. Unlike most of them, puts very little focus on Lordship shenanigans, which I never cared much for.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12188150/1/Like-Grains-of-Sand-in-the-Hourglass]] This fic is what got me interested in the Harry/Nymphadora pairing. Unfortunately, most fics of this kind are incredibly cliché ("you asked for my true form! let's love each other forever"). This one isn't like that -- it depicts Tonks having an accident in the Time Room during the DoM fight throwing her back to the start of 5th year. She goes undercover as a student to watch over Harry.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4113737/1/Promise-Me-Love]] I personally never cared much for Draco/Hermione myself, but if you like the idea of a redeemed Draco, this story is wholesome and fluffy. It's a good and enjoyable fic if you don't take issue with the pairing (I read it a while back when I had an urge to read Dramione).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12369512/1/The-Peace-Not-Promised]] Severus/Lily is my favorite pairing to read about, and this fic is what got me into it. Severus, after death, gets to re-do his life starting from early 6th year (i.e. after the fallout). Not expecting anything to come of that, he instead focuses on taking on a mentoring role for Slytherin House, showing them that there are other options than Voldemort.

** Some of my favourites with a variety of genres:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12424344][Grey Space]] - No pairing, what if Hogwarts doesn't start until you're 14?

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3503388/1/][Birth of a Phoenix]] - A bash-free WBWL with affectionate siblings that'll make you cry. No Pairings. Could've used a beta, but is still excellent.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2352896][Gelosaþ in Écnesse]] - Time travel with Harry ending up as a teacher. A there-and-back-again version of time travel. Slash that's more sweet than explicit.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1124404][One Hundred and Sixty Nine]] - A Hermione-centric time travel. Hermione/Sirius. Fantastic story!

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/][Browncoat, Green Eyes]] - A crossover with Firefly that takes place in the 26th century. Firefly knowledge not really needed, but you should watch it anyway. Who doesn't like a space western?

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11284494][Of a Linear Circle]] - A dude falls out of a portrait in the Slytherin common room. Slash, Snape/OC, but is thus far a minor thing plot-wise. I'm in the progress of reading this and ohmygod, I've been missing out. It's a huge series that's still in progress (1.2 million words and counting).

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8148717/1/][Finding Home]] - Avengers crossover. Watch the 2012 movie or don't, either way is fine. No pairings, Tony & Harry friendship and MoD!Harry. Really wish the later installments weren't abandoned!

- ... I should probably just leave it there. Lucky 7, yada yada.
