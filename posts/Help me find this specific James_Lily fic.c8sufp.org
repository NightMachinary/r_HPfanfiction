There's a specific James/Lily fic I read and enjoyed many moons ago. I think I originally found it on crack-broom, but maybe not. The central conceit was it was written as a diary kept by James during his Marauder days as he met and was falling in love with Lily. There was much mention of bacon and a rather demented cat. Can anyone help me find this one again?
