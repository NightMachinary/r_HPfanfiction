** Hmm... The premise of keeping Harry's characterisation more consistent is fine. There's certainly potential in that idea.

I read through chapter 1, though, and the impression that I had was that it was being written the way that someone would speak; less punctuation, more casual. It makes it harder to follow. A beta reader could probably smooth it out a lot. Furthermore, there were many small changes in dialogue etc, which don't seem to be related to the premise of keeping Harry's character consistent. Perhaps it would be feasible to just assume that readers are familiar with canon and skim over a lot of that.

Having Harry more studious and thoughtful could certainly be a decent foundation for Harmony. I've found very few fics that really sold the relationship to me, but the one that stands out was quite a good read.
