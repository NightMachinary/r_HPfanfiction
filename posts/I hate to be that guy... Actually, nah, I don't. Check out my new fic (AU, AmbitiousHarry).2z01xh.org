Hi all! I started writing a fic a few weeks ago. I'm a uni student, as such, I don't have much time to update. It's also kinda short so far.i

But I hope you will enjoy reading the first few chapters of my fic. *This is the first story-like piece I've written in years! So, I would /love/ feedback.*

I always loved Dumbledore. This fic will have a lot of Dumbledore.

 

*This fic will become very AU.* I will also avoid canon rehash. Harry will be in Slytherin.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11007761/1/Worth-It][*/Worth It/*]] - /Follow Harry through a journey of epic proportions as a bit of extra ambition influences the rest of his life. There are men, and then, there are titans. Will become VERY AU. (Looking for beta) (Non-slash, no pairings)/

** The beginnings of a good story. Just some things.

I agree with [[/u/Zeikos]]. An error a lot of writers (myself included) make is to become too superfluous in our prose. It's often better to simplify the sentence instead of trying to insert so many qualifiers that the sentence becomes broken. Take one of your opening lines for example -

*Robed men and women milled about, returning to their tents, or tending to them, before settling for the night.*

The sentence becomes so muddled that it is easy to confuse what is settling for the night. Is it the men and women or the tents? A better way to phrase it would be:

*Robed men and women milled about, returning to their tents and retiring for the night.*

Simpler and less effusive, but conveying the same point. This isn't to say you should never layer your descriptions. It's just that keeping it simple goes a long way to making it more readable instead of filling sentences with words just to be descriptive. It's just something to keep in mind while you're writing. More periods doesn't make you a simpler writer. It will often make you a better one.

The general plot and characterization is on point. Only 3 chapters in and 6k words aren't much to judge by, but the seeds of a good beginning are there. One thing to consider would be to tone down on the jumping POV's. I think it's another case of keeping it simple rather than over complicating things. If you divert to a different POV than Harry, either make it consistent enough where it appears several times throughout the story or use it infrequently so that it is important when it appears.

I think multiple POV's work often, but it can distract more than anything if used incorrectly.

Keep it up!

*** Thank you! I will make sure to proofread my future chapters specifically for superfluous descriptions.

The two main characters here are Harry and Dumbledore, so I'll keep the POV's locked down to them for the most part (with a lean towards Harry). They think far too differently to convey them properly through only one POV. One is a child brimming with excitement and ambition, one once /was/ a child brimming with excitement and ambition, but is now weathered by the resulting hardships of leadership and life.

So basically, Harry will be the focus of this story, but I will also feature Dumbledore several times. I'll try to make it less distracting, though!

** Hmm, i'm torn. There's nothing objectively wrong in the story but my brain is a jerk. So i'll go to point out my main concern : if you introduce something (like Harry being a metamorph) not Canon be sure it's worth it plotwise. I know it is an AU and you've all the authorial fiat you want but at the beginning it might be the thing that drives people away.

I like the competent!dumbledore bit, at least this assures me that you didn't fall for too many clich√©s. Ps : Canon dumbles never talks about the greater good Ps2: the only criticism i find myself able to do is your prose : in some points you write a lot without saying much, it's not a big deal and it's a personal preference of mine but be carefull to not lose the flow of the story, it would make it a lot harder to read.

*** Thanks for the feedback!

Rest assured Harry's metamorph abilities are not simply just another thing to check off in a list of superpowers. It will be a crucial ability.

I see what you mean about Dumbledore and the Greater Good; however, I think he does truly believe in the Greater Good, or the benefit of all over a few. (However, even he has his weaknesses, and I hope to go more in-depth with his character.)

About the story being a bit wordy - thanks for pointing that out! I'll keep it in mind while writing.

** Like it so far! One tip: try to avoid things that are obvious, like in chapter two: 'Dumbledore's aged voice spoke'. It's a bit redundant. You have several times accentuated that Dumbledore was old. As the reader, we know. And the 'aged voice spoke'... it's not the voice that speaks. It's the person using it. You could skip that whole sentence. We know it will be Dumbledore that answers the question.

Please, don't see it as an attack on your story! Again, I like it so far! Just some constructive criticism.

*** This is actually a very good suggestion - it's also what I get for writing during a time crunch! Thanks! I'll be sure to avoid the redundant prose and phrases.
