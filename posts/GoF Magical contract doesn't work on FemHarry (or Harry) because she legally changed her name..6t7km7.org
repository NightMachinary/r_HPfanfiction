There are many fics out there (Usually crossovers) where Fem!Harry is usually abandoned in a other country, and then get adopted by a family or someone and get named something else, Harriet Potter becomes Jessica Bernstein for example. And then as usual GoF happens and she is forced to compete, despite not having the name ''Harriet Potter''

I want to see Fics out there that just Have Harriet just enjoy her own adventure (usually in a anime) and doesn't go through the whole ''angst/drama'' of the whole GoF shebang.

You might or might not have seen my older post, but I prefer if she ISN'T friends with Hermione or the weasley twins, or sees Sirius or even Remus as ''Family''


** I know I've read a couple where this has happened, though not necessarily with a girl Harry. I think it might actually have been a Sirius adopts Harry one.

Anyway, most recently, linkffn(like a red-headed stepchild) did it, but it does not feature a femHarry (yet...you never know though), and it actually worked. It's also not a crossover...technically. Has a fair amount of intersections though.

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind.
