He implies that he's bringing Harry in on hunting the horcruxes, but what if he had another reason? What if the protections on the cave could only be breached by Riddle? By bringing Harry, and by extension the scar Horcrux, the cave recognised that Riddle's magical signature was there. Discuss?


** Dumbledore already knew what the potion was gonna do. He knew he needed a 2nd person to take the locket. Since he didn't want to tell anyone in the order about the Horcrux, he took Harry. Simple. Taking Snape was out too, given the amount of time he was likely to spend in Riddle's company in the future.

Your theory is plausible too, I guess. But then Dumbledore had the Elder Wand. You can do quite a bit with that, like deactivate that part of the protection, for example.

** How would R.A.B. have been able to get the real locket then?

**** True, but that has nothing to do with the point I wanted to make about him having no part of Riddle. If the theory that you need a piece of him to enter the cave was true, Regulus wouldn't have been able to get the locket :)

** Harry had plot armor thanks to the prophecy, so he knew they'd make it out.

** May you correct the flair of your post, I am afraid it is not correct your question is not about the subreddit in itself.
