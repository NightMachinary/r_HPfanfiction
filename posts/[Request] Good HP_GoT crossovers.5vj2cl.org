It can be with A Song of Ice and Fire, too. I feel like I've dried up the well of decent stories and hit the "Harry with his harem go to the GoT universe" muddy bottom...

Help D:


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11098283/1/The-Black-Prince][*The Black Prince*]] linkffn(11098283), is definitely the best of the lot. Harry is 'reborn' of sorts (it hasn't quite explained what's going on yet) as the second son of Robert Baratheon and Cersei Lannister. While this is definitely Harry, he's also molded by his life in Westeros - and the world adapts to his presence. Currently ongoing.

There's also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12000096/1/Duelling-with-a-Glass-Sword][*Dueling with a Glass Sword*]] linkffn(12000096) which is a female!Harry interacting with a reborn Rhaegar Targaryen in the Harry Potter world who is looking to fix where he went wrong.

  He remembers being Harry Potter. He dreams of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a beast borne of ice and death with eyes red as blood and an army of cold dead things. He is the second son of the king, a spare, but his fortunes change when secrets rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming, but magic is might.

I will read Dueling with a Glass Sword, though.

EDIT: I read Dueling with a Glass Sword. It honestly didn't impress me, as it stuck pretty firmly onto canon, and the writer always dragged every moment out. I have always believed that brevity is golden.

** I've struggled to find one that is any good, and I've tried all of the ones recommended so far... I always had this idea of a character swap, some ancient device that was activated and swapped two of the characters (I was thinking the Mirror of Erised with a similar mirror in Westeros). I've thought Ginny/Sansa, Ron/Jon, Harry/Robb, Hermione/Arya. I thought it could be a chapter at a time for each of the two stories, and the stories slowly meld together by introducing a communication device of some sorts (think of the mirrors that Harry and Sirius communicate with). Somehow in the swap the Westeros character would have to be given magical powers and gets to attend Hogwarts, not sure yet if the HP character would retain their power. Whether my story would be just a swap for a short period of time or whether they basically live the others life throughout the story, I'm unsure. The most difficult part if it is novel-length, is how do I explain how the swap has affected the overall ASOIAF universe without introducing other POV characters. The universe is so expansive, how do I explain how Jon is affected by Arya Robb or Sansa being swapped out, or how if any affect it has on the Daenarys across the world, what does it change in the Lannister/Varys/Littlefinger schemes, especially if I swap someone so important in their schemes like Robb or Sansa (I think a swap of Jon or Arya would have less of an effect). Explaining the effect on the HP universe is easy because in canon we are only ever given one point of view anyways.

I've thought about this idea a lot, and I've never actually endeavored such an undertaking that this story would be, but of all the possible ideas I've thought of, this is the only one that really seems to turn my gears and get me thinking about it for more than a passing moment.

That said I'm extremely surprised linkffn(The Difference One Man Can Make) hasn't been suggested. Maybe that fic was bad and I just remember it being great for some reason.

I recall that it drags a bit here and there, but it was still my favorite HP/GoT. The only thing that competes is The Black Prince, and it's just too short.

****** This is exactly how I feel reading your fic. I was super put off by the fact that it's got a very anime feel to it, but it's fun for what it is. I've been following it for the last few months, and despite it's flaws, your fic is entertaining and engaging. Excited that Harry's in Essos now. Keep up the good work!

In that vein, I've got to recommend linkffn(The Wizard of Harrenhal). The writing in this story is actually pretty decent. Harry is really likeable, and reasonably close to canon (At least in personality, maybe not in his actions and decisions). Not exactly a masterpiece, but it's a fun fic.

linkffn(A New World to Conquer by LordOfTheGrey) is really fun as well. The summary and premise were pretty off putting to me at first, but it was definitely readable (compared to most HP/GoT crossovers anyway)

linkffn(Game of Magic by ColonelChips) isn't too bad, but it's super unfinished. It was worth a read to me though.

linkffn(Harry Arryn by BloodKing9) is about the same.

I'll highly second Last Lion of House Rayne and The Difference One Can Make.

******* Thanks mate, am writing the latest chapter for it, right now.

And yes, as a gamer and anime fan my fanfiction is heavily influenced by it, making it a hit and miss for many people.

  My reward for beating the Demon Emperor and sending him back to hell? Finding myself in an unknown land, hounded by heralds of ice and fire, as well as the idiotic peoples of the lands in this... Westeros. Is it possible to find a way home? I don't know. Eventual Harry/Daenerys. As in way, way later. Stop asking when :P

** There's [[https://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/patroni-in-winterfell-an-asoiaf-hp-crossover.315157/]["Patroni in Winterfell"]], you need to register to read it, though, and that can take a day or two. "Harry Potter, his wife Ginny Weasley/Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger/Weasley and Ronald Weasley, after dying of old age, are reunited and asked by Death to give her a hand in stopping so much death from happening in Westeros."

Not a curbstomp so far, more subtle influences.

*** I tried it. The story felt like the author was too afraid to curbstomp, and it ended up sticking primarily to canon with no divergence...

I read up until "the harridan", btw.

**** Indeed. Given what those characters managed as teenagers, there shouldn't be many if any problems. Hermione by herself could simply duplicate what she did with her parents, and personality-change any troublesome noble. Add the Gemino Charm and Apparition, and logistics are suddenly much easier as well.

***** It's saddening how many people fall into that trap. The crossovers I read are more along the lines of "look at how Harry and co. react to moments we thought shocking in Game of Thrones" rather than legitimately have him forge his own path.

And, hell- in that story, Harry's presumably a seasoned, wise 150 year old wizard and his idea of protecting the Starks is to maintain a reactionary stance-- even after Bran gets thrown out of the tower?

Same applies to Ginny, she's also quite old, but derived pleasure from humiliating Joffrey? I feel like the author hadn't quite considered the effects age have on a person. I'm halfway in my twenties and I find the antics of teenagers to be quite boring. Imagine someone seven times older than I am, like the protagonists of the fiction.

That's why I'd used post GoF Harry (with a few tweaks I'd made in one of my stories) in my HP/GoT x-over. He was old enough to be able to make halfway intelligent decisions, but young and stupid enough to run roughshod over established rules and principles.

TL;DR some writers are just bad.

** linkffn(Hadrian Lannister Lion of the Rock by Sage1988) and linkffn(A Lion Still Has Claws by Light-in-Oblivion) in my opinion two best ongoing. I don't really like stories where Harry solves everything with magic. Although there is magic in those two stories but not as much as in others. You should also check out linkffn(Dragon of the North by Tellie571) and linkffn(The Dragonborn by DragonsKing83) if you want more magic.
