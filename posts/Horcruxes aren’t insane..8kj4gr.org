A bit of history and thought experiments first.

Fear is an incredibly useful tool. Can you imagine how many millions of lives have been saved by the flight or fight reaction over the course of all human history? Fear allows us to react in reasonable ways without breaking down the options. You see a hungry big cat and you escape or fight. Pretty reasonable and pretty obvious right?

No I want you to imagine a society in antiquity. You have a neighboring tribe that may or may not threaten you. You decide to build a wall and fortifications. Then they don't attack.

Was the wall worth it? You devoted precious resources to this wall. Was the opportunity cost worth it? Regardless of whether the wall made your neighbor second guess themselves. Regardless of whether they were or weren't going to attack. Could you ever know?

I want you to put yourself in the shoes of a man born in the early 20th century. You grow up with McKinley was assassinated by a anarcho-leftist then you grow up into the first red scare. Is it crazy for you to build bomb shelters to protect yourself and your family during the second? Is that reasonable? Forget what you know now and try to put yourself in that level of fear.

Or try and put yourself in the level of fear the romans felt when the Cimbri were at their doorstep and they gave Gaius Marius extra-constitutional powers and elected him for an unprecedented fifth and sixth term as consul.

Or try and put yourself on socrates' jury.

It's really easy to make the decision when you aren't afraid or aren't attached to the system in question.

Now imagine this boy who grows up terrified of dying. The thought of dying haunts his every moment. Every single second that hungry beast is at his heels and motivation him. Pushing him to run.

In this way, horcruxes are a logical answer to a terrified person's desperate attempt to survive. The idea that Voldemort was insane or stupid for what he did shows blatant disregard for his character and a total lack of empathy with his fear.

Is he a megalomaniac? Sure. Does his fear make him lash out? Of course! Is he truly crazy for responding irrationally to irrational terror? Categorically we can say no.

It really bothers me to read fanfiction where he is portrayed as just a crazy big bad guy who is bad because bad bad bad.

** I just figured that he's an actual psycopath.

Straight from the wiki article on psychopathy:

- Boldness. Low fear including stress-tolerance, toleration of unfamiliarity and danger, and high self-confidence and social assertiveness.

- Disinhibition. Poor impulse control including problems with planning and foresight, lacking affect and urge control, demand for immediate gratification, and poor behavioral restraints.

- Meanness. Lacking empathy and close attachments with others, defiance of authority.

*** JKR originally wrote crime fiction before the Harry Potter series. Which is why she returned to it under her pen name Galbraith afterwards. But I think because of this, Voldemort basically covers a checklist of psychopathic tendencies. I remember when trying to create my own Voldemort for my fic that I compared him to such a list, and he checks all the boxes, even including the killing of small animals (although arguably this was a calculated move against Billy Stubbs rather than for the sake of killing the rabbit).

***** While, I believe that OPs point is a valid one, I also believe that Voldemort just craves power because it is offering him gratification and probably is filling some void (inability to love or something like that). But in the end that's what he wanted: full control over the other people including their thoughts, overcoming human weaknesses such as death, making his name so feared that people would not even dare pronounce it... he wanted to become a god and I think that's pretty much it. And it's not such a stretch of thought to believe that such people exist. The book "The 48 Laws of Power" is full of historical examples of real people that thought like him.

Besides Voldemort is supposed to be the opposite of Harry. Tom Riddle comes into the magical world as a nobody and is desperate for attention. Harry Potter comes into the magical world as a celebrity but does not want the fame. Voldemort gains his followers by seducing them with the idea of a world where they will be superior and then enslaving them through the dark mark, whereas Harry gains his support from people he wins over with friendship and treating them as equals. Voldemort kills others to overcome death and meets a worse fate, while Harry accepts death to save others thus returning to life.

****** There seem to have been a number of people who have made one horcrux. Read up about them, check that they didn't suffer ill-effects. If not make one horcrux. Step two, seek out other forms of immortality enhancement, preferably including a few reputable ones and use them. Have as many and varied fail-safes as possible.

However, in each case he should try to have an accomplice, someone fanatically loyal (Bellatrix would work) who can try the method first and who has been bound to silence. Observe them for signs that the methods have detrimental effects. If not pursue those methods. Preferably try to be cautious so that you don't use up the follower. Then, if you really feel the need test out the effects of multiple horcruxes on an individual and decide whether you want to endure those effects. Then consider whether you want to destroy this follower if you think they know too much (preferably you may have removed a few key pieces of information from them periodically).

If you feel uncomfortable about trusting a follower coerce a prisoner.

In any case experiment before acting and have a good excuse as to why you're immortal.

Unless you absolutely have to wage a war to take power, don't (not if your primary objective is living forever), it just incentivises people to kill you.

Edit: I thought this was a reply to a different comment, but it mostly stands. Also though, if you are waging a war make sure you have a spare identity or twenty to that you can vanish if you really need to.

Work in the Department of Mysteries and get a time-turner if possible (Voldemort must surely be able to pass their vetting process).

Make sure that horcruxes work. The problem with them is that you can't test if they work on your own.

** The insane part of his Horcrux creation is in other aspects of it than the underlying survival instinct.

- You need to commit cold-blooded murder to create one. The "cold-blooded" part of it certifies at least a modicum of psychopathy on his part. Snuffing out a life just like that, this total lack of empathy, /that/ is insane.

- His choice of horcrux was tremendously impractical and entirely steered by his megalomaniac desires. High value artefacts and his pet snake? Why not take a pebble and drop it into the Atlantic Ocean? You obviously don't need a horcrux present to resurrect yourself, so why not keep them somewhere so far away from any living soul that finding them is practically impossible? He wasn't rational about it. It almost seems like he /wanted/ people to find them by guessing on the clues like a psychopathic serial killer wants to be found.

He was legitimately evil by pretty much every moral code out there. He had no redeeming qualities in his later life. During his teenage years you could maybe just call him a deeply disturbed boy, lashing out at the world. But in his later life, when he aimed to conquer and destroy, he was 100% just /"crazy big bad guy who is bad because bad bad bad"/.

We don't know what a horcrux does to your soul aside from preventing it from passing on. No one really does. Even the creator of the Horcrux, who by all accounts was an extremely evil man and would be a role model to Voldemort, only made one. The soul is not a trivial thing.

****** I think the two aren't mutually exclusive.

OP is trying to merge the canon interpretation of the Soul - a known and valued factor - with that of the IRL interpretation - complete lack of knowledge. This is actually accurate, and partly why I think Voldemort is deserving of his title as the worst dark wizard of the century; He does not share the wizarding viewpoint of the soul and its value. However, in learning and performing magic that involves the soul, he would have learned of its definite existence and thus its inherent, if subjective, value. He would have learned of the Dementors and the result of their Kiss, leaving a body soulless and yet still alive. He would have /known/ that a soul matters in at least one respect.

Thus, from a wizarding viewpoint, it /is/ insane to create a Horcrux. It is an extremely significant act to tear off a piece of your soul and seal it away. Almost everyone would have satisfied their fear of death with just one horcrux. Yet Voldemort did this not once, but multiple times, an act not even the creator of the Horcrux attempted. I do think that by this point Voldemort was clinically insane, his phobia so overwhelming that it drove him off the edge and damaged him beyond repair. The only way to remove a horcrux from existence, aside from complete destruction, is personal and sincere remorse. By his sixth Horcrux, Voldemort was completely incapable of that. He was no longer a human and was instead evil for evil's sake.

** I find this incredibly true as I grew older. When I first read the HP books (Avatar the Last Airbender can also be a good example), I always had this perception that people can be ‘evil' just because they can. However, it shifted when I started to try to see it from a their point of view. Yes, there are some that can be evil just because they can, but I find that the majority draws their motivation from something deeper. Sometimes tragic childhoods or something that pushes them over the line. Other times because they come from unfortunate circumstances. There are plenty more situations, but those are some of they big ones I could think of. They don't justify the truly bad decisions they put others through. They simply show that circumstances can push anyone to do truly immoral acts.

**** Mostly Zuko. The others you mentioned can be used as examples as well. Any AtLA character really. But since I'm talking about Zuko, I'll explain him.

I mainly use Zuko as an example because when we where introduced to his character we immediately would dislike him because he is the ‘bad guy' trying to attack a peaceful village and take the main protagonist. In the first episode we judged Zuko for how he looks and how he acts without much context other than “Fire Nation is bad so he's bad too, oh, how he acts add facts to this conclusion. And he follows them persistently and ends up setting places on fire. More facts.”

However, as we learned more about Zuko's character we began to root for him. One example was Zuko's Agni Kai with Zhao. Even though it was established that Zuko was an antagonist, we began to become sympathetic towards him since we learned that Zhao is even worst. We began to notice more admirable qualities. Especially with Iroh as his conscious.

Since that was overshadowed by other events that adds towards his bad guy persona, it is not till we actually learned about Zuko's backstory which really open our eyes. The reason that Zuko was a portrayed as a ‘bad guy' draws from his motivation of wanting to go home and simply be accepted by his family. Those motivations give context towards his actions made him truly complex. The reason why Zuko did all the immoral acts generic for a antagonist is drawn from him wanting his father's approval. Thus reveal that motivation is the source of why he became an antagonist towards Aang from the start.

** Agreed with the others that he's canonically an unhinged psychopath - but your points on horcruxes are spot-on. From a materialist (i.e. non-Cartesian-Dualist) point of view, horcruxes are the right* decision. Is the HP canon dualist (and in particular, does an afterlife exist that souls can travel to)? Canon presents a bunch of things - ghosts, the resurrection stone, the veil, dementors - that kinda-sorta could go either way. Certainly, for someone very paranoid and afraid of death, who might not know about the veil or resurrection stone (which doesn't even work that well), the evidence wouldn't seem very conclusive.

Two identities exist, but neither are the original self that was torn apart to create a horcrux. So from that point, they're not a sane choice.

**** That's a pretty complex question - a materialist in the HP universe could plausibly come to several different answers.

Of course, in the real world, all the evidence points to the physical brain doing the thinking (including subjective experience - qualia). In the HP universe it's a bit more complicated - do ghosts and portraits "think", and is it a "soul" that does the thinking? Do dementors act on some real, magical entity called the soul, or is "eating the soul" just a fanciful/superstitious way of referring to massive, irreparable brain damage?

There are a number of possibilities:

- Pure dualism - You are your soul, the soul does the thinking and has subjective experience. It can exist without the body and can "go on" to an afterlife. (Whether the afterlife exists is actually a separate question - existence of souls does not /necessitate/ the existence of an afterlife.) What "splitting the soul" does is also a separate question - the diary (seemingly) had subjective experience, and Nagini may have, but did the locket/cup/etc? If horcruxes do have qualia, does the original qualia disappear, does it necessarily stay in the original body and the horcrux's qualia is new, or is it a SOMA-like copying where you don't know which one will be "you"?

- Souls exist but are simple magical entities, and do not think or have much to do with identity, but can magically anchor a person to life (with possible applications in healing as well as dark magic).

- Pure materialism - "souls" are nothing more than superstition, ghosts and paintings are just magical apparitions/constructs, horcruxes root or backup a person's brain in some complex way, and of /course/ anything that seems like an afterlife or a "limbo" - Harry's King's Cross - is pure hallucination. This perspective is pretty dodgy in the HPverse, but might attract cynics and muggle-raised wizards.

Canon intentionally shies away from giving conclusive answers to any of these questions, but seems to be gesturing very strongly towards pure dualism. Voldemort would /probably/ be inclined towards pure materialism, but even as a pure dualist, it's possible for him to believe horcruxes are useful.

** I mean, building a wall is a little bit different from murdering someone in cold blood. Plus, apparently the rest of the procedure for making a horcrux is Bad News.

I don't think anyone is calling Tom Riddle evil just for being scared of death. Horcruxes are only "logical" if you have no empathy for other people and place no value on their lives - which is what makes people call Tom Riddle evil.

I will say that of course it's more interesting to read a Tom Riddle that's more than just "crazy bad guy that's bad because bad". But it's possible to write one and also keep in mind that horcruxes are...well, not good.

Prior to that, baby killing isn't actually that crazy.

Alternatively he could just not have killed babies, but it is fairly plausible that Voldemort is trying to learn from history.

****** I've been proposing this theory for some time:

The Books were a test and PR campaign undertaken by the British Ministry of Magic. Its original goal was to identify Muggles' response to the concept of Magic. Needless to say, the results vastly exceeded its most optimistic expectation. Not only were the great majority of Muggles happy with Magic, but those involved in this campaign made billions in profit off those gullible Muggles.

While key outcomes in the Books were not altered, actual details of that conflict greatly differed. As often the case in history, winners were highly praised, and losers mercilessly bashed.

--------------

Following this theory, the 'real' Voldemort was nothing like described in the Books. He neither looked like a snake nor did he mutilate his own soul (although he did perform several dark rituals to increase his magical power).

Although he fought for a cause that might appear archaic to the modern Muggle world, it nevertheless made some sense in the Magical World (one major point of the conflict was the governing structure of Magical Britain. Voldemort favored the traditional oligarchy in which 'Old Families' called the shots, while Dumbledore wanted to turn MoM into a centralized modern government. The boiling point was reached when Dumbledore tried to pass a law that slapped enormous inheritance tax as a mean to weaken the 'Old Families'.)

Tom Riddle had been teaching DADA from 1957 to 1968 when he resigned the post in protest. The war began in earnest when MoM tried to arrest him for his almost militant opposition to the Inheritance Tax in 1971. From then on, he adopted the mantle 'Lord Voldemort' as he completed a very important power boosting ritual.

Voldemort inspired loyalty not through wantonly torturing his followers, as the Books fondly depicted, but through persuasion, protection, and true leadership. He was also very protective of his loyal members, and went to great length to extract retributions for their sufferings.

His tactics were brutal and ruthless, but so were his enemies that were supposed to be on the 'right side on history'. Both sides did commit their shares of atrocities, as was generally the case in a civil war.

But in the end, despite defeating his arch rival Albus Dumbledore in a decisive engagement, Voldemort underestimated the cunning and ruthlessness of the young Trio, walked into their traps, and was killed.

After his death, the winners instituted systematic purges in Magical Britain, and silenced most critics. The Trio, just as brilliant as Octavian (the most famous case of a teenager trio seizing power), eventually earned their legitimacy by improving the lives of most wizards and witches in Britain.

Sure, it's extreme but you didn't really hurt somebody else (to some extent) or mess yourself up, did you? Horcruxes involve not only murdering another human being but also tearing apart your own soul. It's, well, blasphemous. It's considered taboo in the Magical world to even consider making a Horcrux and tearing a part of your soul away. To willingly do it six times is just unheard of! Not only that, but the making of a horcrux is also for selfish reasons: to make sure you can't die. In a way, you sacrifice somebody else's life and a piece of your own humanity just to extend your own life. And Voldemort does it six times (willingly).

At the very least he has an irrational fear of death. I find it completely okay to call him bat-poo insane... especially if you believe in a soul in the first place (and whatever you believe they were talking about, their magic, their soul, their astral self) then he was tearing apart the thing that made him .. him..

I don't think you can tear your soul into several pieces without going insane. Whether or not he was insane before he started is of little consequence considering he was still in High School when he began.

I like a little nuance, I like a bad guy that is the hero of their own story. I like when the bad guy has a point and you grudgingly see why he does what he does. In Fanfiction I am hoping for more from Voldemort most of the time than we got in cannon.

***** But righteous murder doesn't lead to a horcrux. Killing in the name of justice doesn't count. Killing in the name of mercy doesn't count. You have to kill an innocent life - take someone entirely undeserving of death and kill them in cold blood.

And killing child and animal abusers is as easy as pulling a trigger; as easy as letting a blade slit their throat. Killing isn't complicated. The mechanics of it are incredibly easy, really. Take a big stone and let it drop on their heads.

The problem with killing is that people are capable of extreme levels of empathy. To think someone deserves death and to actually kill them are action which are /worlds/ apart from each other. Why do you think soldiers need to go through a drill? Humans are incapable of /just killing/. There are plenty of stories of soldiers from the Napoleonic wars to the first world war in which they screamed, roared and threatened the other soldiers, shot wildly in the air, but when they had the other guy in the crosshairs and looked them in the eyes, they just /stopped/. They couldn't kill them, even though they were the enemy. The drill is there to make killing an instinctive reaction to enemy contact - and plenty of soldiers suffer the consequences of it when back home, when civilians surround them. Untrained, non-fanatic and psychologically sound humans - /most of us/ - are practically incapable of cold-blooded murder. That is a truth. Every great army on the planet has studies underlining this, because they had to deal with this to make effective soldiers out of otherwise normal human beings.
