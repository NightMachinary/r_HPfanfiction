Hey There! Are there any FanFics you guys can recommend where Harry get re-sorted due to some event? Be it due to the treatment he received from the school because of the Tri-Wizard tournament or any other reason. Also, I do not mind which house he'll get resorted to even an AU house like "House Emrys" for example that I have seen being used a few times. In regards to the pairing, I do not mind but I prefer it to not be slash. Thanks!


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Distaff Side) Harry gets thrown into a Rule 63 Universe and has to be Sorted again. Since his counterpart is already in Gryffindor, he ends up in Hufflepuff. (Who turn out to be their own secret society in the magical world.)

*** Meh. There is annoying bashing, the author doesn't get any characters right (Harry letting a man he barely knows bash his friends without defending them at all in the first chapters is the biggest sign), the exposition dump is done very clumsily at the beginning, but Harry seemed totally into it for some reason, never questioning why he even needs to know it.

Sirius is of course different, I can live with that - but it's annoying that the attributes Hermione and Ron get bashed for don't exist or are vastly exaggerated - even if there are better ways to bash them.

So yeah, the fic sounded interesting, but it's a big no for me.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.
