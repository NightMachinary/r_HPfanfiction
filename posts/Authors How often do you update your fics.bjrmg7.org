I try on average for every ten days but I worry that's not soon enough? Or perhaps my readers are extra greedy?

I'm writing my most "Popular" fic to date (popular for me with 16,000+ hits- laughable for all experienced authors) but because it's a higher hit count than my others, I feel a strange pressure.

How often do you update? How long are your chapters? Do you worry taking a longer time decreases readership?


** Weekly, until I don't, and then it's years in between. Years, and counting. Chapters were a couple thousand words each, at least. Up to almost 5k for one of 'em, I think.

*** This is me.

​

The trouble is writer's block. When it flows I can easily churn out multiple 10K+ chapters in a week. But when it stalls I miss years between updates.

**** I got halfway through the opening act of a Worm fanfic, and then I wrote a chapter that on re-reading would absolutely not have fit in with what I was trying to do. So I have like 2k words that are coherent and fic-compliant, but somewhat irrelevant to the story, and that just kinda cooked my goose.

I've a HP adventuring/cursebreaking/zombie(maybe? Maybe as 2nd part, after adventuring thing?) thing started, but it's one chapter 2/3 done and then the 2nd chapter half done, and Harry is about to fight his way out of the bank.

There's nothing lost if you just open a google doc and write some words down for your story. I have a bunch of pages that are only the beginnings of ideas, but when I get enough words on 'em that as a reader they'd be worth reading, I'll throw 'em to the winds and see who likes it.

** Most people try to update somewhere between 1 or 2 weeks. Slower updates are somewhere between 2 weeks and a month, but those are usually larger (10k+) chapters. Updating every 10 days is perfectly average, your readers are just being greedy.

Update at your own pace and don't let the whining of greedy readers pressure you into writing faster, otherwise you'll just burn yourself out and end up with writer's block.

** When I start a story I experience a burst of energy that usually results in me drafting a large portion of the text, probably around 15 or so chapters. I'll then post these at a rate of one per week.

However, after that initial burst, I find it much harder to write, so it can take me months to get anything else written. So I'll slow to something like a chapter or two ever six months or so. It's not a good system.

Chapters are usually around 4000 words.

Long breaks between posting does decrease readership. After finishing my first story I swore to never post again until the entire fic was finished. I then promptly disregarded that self-given advice when I got that burst of energy for my next story...

** Your popular fic is much much popular than anything I've written so far haha. But then, I tend to read for a niche audience.

Anyway, that's probably better for them because I'm a highly irregular updates. Sometimes it's days (in the beginning), sometimes months, more often, it's somewhat yearly. Fortunately for me, my readers never tried to pressure me into posting more often.

My minimum length for a chapter is 4K+ words,except for the one-shot collections, but I adjust the length to be around the previous chapters' one. I don't mind going long though: my longest chapter to date is between 10k and 15k words. Actually, I have to consciously force myself not to go overboard because I'm the kind of person who feels like they always have to write more than the previous chapter.

** For my bigger stories, I updated every 3 days for each one. One of them averaged 5,140 words per chapter (for a total of 34 chapters), and another averaged 8,770 words per chapter (for a total of 21 chapters). My two smaller stories average 2,200 - 2,440 words for chapter (both were 18 chapters long) and updated every other day. My current story is 9 chapters in and averages 4,600 words per chapter. I began updating it every week but work has been too busy to keep up with that schedule.

** Between work, home maintenance, family obligations, grandkids' school, and sporting events, and hobbies (Got myself a spiffy 3D Printer that I'm learning to play with) I average 3 chapters a year.

​

My chapters are a minimum of 10k words long, and aren't all for the same story. Some are for an original work that may, or may not ever see the light of day, others are for Technomage, my most popular story, and I also put time into older stories that I haven't finished yet.

​

I am an utterly undisciplined writer. Sometimes I'll go weeks without writing a word, other times, the words just pour out. Sometimes I will take my 10k word chapter and start editing it and end up with three or four scenes of less than 500 words each.

** I start 2-3 very promising chapters, watch hundreds of hopeful followers flowing in, end with a cliffhanger and a note "that really, next chapter will be posted soon guys" and then enjoy their anguish, rage and suffering, letting me revel in the satisfaction of being a more cruel villain than Voldemort.

​

No seriously, my I prefer writing big chapters of 10K words or longer and posted those every month or two-three. I stopped writing because it was only a minor hobby and everything else in real life takes priority.

  Who knew Harry asking Hermione to the Yule Ball in Fourth Year would cause so much drama? Especially amongst those whom they thought were their truest friends! H/HR. Rated M for an eventual reason. Bashing of Dumbledore, Weasleys (Ron, Ginny, Molly), Snape, Viktor Krum, others.

** I tried it every day, I tried it every week. Once I left it for a month. I tried mornings, afternoons, evenings, weekdays, weekends. Nothing made the slightest difference: they still didn't get any attention. In the end, I settled for two or three times a week just to get the damn thing out of the way. Those stories, of course, were complete before I started posting.
