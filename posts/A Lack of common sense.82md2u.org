I'm looking for fics that have harry or the MC suffer from a lack of common sense. Where they feel like what they are capable is the normality For example: A Harry Potter that feels that it's normal to levitate a Cerberus with the levitation charm Or That it's normal for wizards to just cast spells directly without a wand and that you only need a wand when you're first learning the spells

Basically I'm looking for a character that's overpowered and believes that their strength(overpowerness) is the normality for everyone

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.

** Sounds like the old "Harry breaks the rules of magic because he doesn't know it can't be done" trope. I vaguely remember linkffn(2379367) having something along those lines.

*** "This means war" by Jeconais has that trope too. Harry gets OP as fuck because no one told him that there's things you can't do, so he does them anyway.
