So I been having this idea for story for while now, basically since I heard comedian make joke about Trump winning presidency and how he would expect parades in the streets everyday proclaiming the greatness of America.

My idea I been forming in my head is a very stero-typical American (with stero-types that non-Americans perceive.) school showing up and competing. I do not mean the pansy Salem Witchcraft school either. I mean the United States Magical Military Academy, or something similar like United States Battle Mages Academy. Basically the school trains students that voluntary to enlist in the U.S Military after completion of their magical training. School where the students main focus on muggle and magical combat.

Some of the plots with the story I have in my mind are:

The main person from the U.S heir to old family from the UK and missing part of old alliance between his family and the Potters and Longbottoms. I am thinking of family name Wallace. (No my name isn't Wallace, but I do have ancestors with name Wallace. I just always liked it....probably braveheart.)

The reason for U.S getting involved in this competition, because they been gathering reports of Voldemort possible return or of his old followers starting to make to much activity, and wish to be able to help before it gets worse. ( Good going DE at the world cup.) Because, eventually they know the dark bady will eventually turn it sites on America.

Also, play off the stero types of Americans, because I do find them to be funny. While also trying to just have fun with the story.

Also, have there competitor use as much muggle military technology in the competition to try and rattle the pure bloods and show how far muggles have come in terms of combating and effectiveness. For example competitor transfiguring some rocks into mini-guns or rocket launchers to simply kill the dragon in the first task. Simply showing muggle weapons cutting down of the hardest magical beast with ease. Granted still in early thoughts about this.....at least with ease part.

One scene I have in my mind is having the school show up crashing through the Hogwarts front gates with a MRAP vehicle with Red, White, and Blue smoke bellowing behind it. Then deploying flash bangs or something similar before the students storm out of the vehicle to stand in formation in front of the school.

I just curious is there something like this already? If I where to try and write something like this would be actually like an idea of this. I would like to try and make it with some comedy but, also series in what happens. I kinda of idea for similar plots stretching 3 stories. I do now know about couples or how I present some people compared to the books.

MRAP was only introduced during the Iraq War (2003-?), it didn't exist in 1994 when that TWT was held.

--------------

With respect to magical US, we really don't know anything about modern day MACUSA. They might have made a 180 degree turn during WW2 on their strict segregation from Muggles, just like their Muggle counterpart who made a 180 degree turn on isolationism.

Seeing Grindelwald going all in with Hitler, American wizards might have gone all out to help Allied forces. From then on, they could become an important part of the US government and later play important roles during the Cold War, for example safeguarding US nuclear weapons from Soviet wizards.

So your story would have merit, but please don't involve Muggle technologies that didn't exist back in mid 1990s.

*** Original idea was just troops transport vehicle. The MRAP just the first the pop in my mind as I was writing. I would try to stick with time frames.

***** Thanks. I think the idea of a M2 Bradley might be great idea for what I am thinking.

**** Military high schools in the US don't have access to military-only vehicles - and while I realize magic could replace that, it's not really in-theme. If you're going for something truly American Military Prep School, I think you'd do better with either a WWII-era plane, or a Revolutionary War era or Civil War era ship. Those are very much considered "patriotic symbols"

***** Thanks for the ideas. One of the plots in my thinking is since the government is taking interest in developing situation of "dark" activity that the government might be more accepting of using modern equipment as a early intimidation tactic. The school just being a benefactor of a situation. While they truly just stuck in the middle.

I have this idea of trying to write from the school side but, while also showing government involved more then normally would....or maybe I am just sitting here trying to justify my original ideas.

Thinking of B-52 plane flying over Hogwarts and having everyone paratroop out. Does this seem little over the top? First thought was have them storm out of the plane with brooms.

I liked the idea of land arrival since Durmstrang showed up in a boat in the lake, and Beauxbatons showed up from the air with the carriage.

** US should get involved in the Tournament not because of Voldemort or anything so plot heavy. They should literally just show up because they want to win. And /then/ plot things happen and they help because Americans don't know how to mind their damn business when it comes to foreign affairs.

*** I like the idea of Americans intervening against Voldemort, using a ritual that was specifically designed to kill individuals with horcruxes. They got rid of Voldemort quickly, but messed up the occupation afterwards, and now multiple factions were fighting an endless civil war in magical Britain.

A decade after Voldemort's fall, the civil war in Britain had spread to continental Europe, with Germany, Balkans, and Spain all in chaos. More distant magical foreign powers were further drawn into the conflict, such as Russia, Ottoman Empire, Abbasid Caliphate, Greater Persia, East African Confederation, and United China.

** They would arrive on a parade float travelling at 10 mph along the road through Hogsmeade and up to the castle, constantly blasting something by John Phillip Sousa. Once inside the gate, the front of the float bursts open, allowing the two dozen students to drive out onto the grounds in a collection of go-karts.

If Gilderoy Lockhart were not stuck addle-pated in a hospital, he would bemoan their lack of composure.

*** The buzzing vehicles drove around the courtyard and between panicked clutches of students. A tall man in a uniform exited from a hatch in the top of float and blew a shrill whistle. From what seemed a random and chaotic swarming of toy cars, the cadets drove back to the float, aligning themselves in a ruler-straight row a few yards in front of it. They still had their engines grumbling, as if ready to drive off again at a moment's notice.

A second pattern from the shrill whistle prompted them to turn the engines off.

Dumbledore approached the array of vehicles, meeting the tall uniformed man as he stepped down onto the ground.

"Sergeant-Major Krang, I presume?"

"That'd be me, Headmaster Dumbledore."

"You know, we were expecting you a week ago."

"Ah, well, we originally deployed from our stealth craft at the harbor in Inverness, but then we ended up driving all over hill and dale looking for this place. You know, it ain't on any of our maps? Damned inconvenient. I think the boys might actually be a bit deaf from the march playing after so long. Won't complain about it, though, nosiree."

"You were playing the music all the way here?"

"No sir- only during daylight. We're not idgits."

** Illvermorny champion sounded more realistic than this (and I still don't know how an entire school can be a Gary-Sue). Frankly, I believe that Illvermorny is largely similar to Hogwarts in many aspects since it was founded by a brit. It's likely that the castle is just bigger, and they maybe have a dedicated Duelling/Dark Arts Class, simply because it's the American way to 'practice what should be prohibited'.

I would rather see a story where Harry takes up Duelling and meets Illvermorny, Mahoutokoro, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang students in combat.
