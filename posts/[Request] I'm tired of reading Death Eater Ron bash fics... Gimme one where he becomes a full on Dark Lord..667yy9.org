It's funny, I'm actually writing a Slytherin Hermione fic, and my Ron ends up making some dumb decisions (because he's 11, and that's what 11-year-olds do) then thoroughly regretting them later. Yet one person still claimed I was "bashing Ron and Gryffindor" ... go figure :)

****** I think it's an issue of trust- if I see Ron making dumb decisions in a fanfic, I have to know if I trust the author to develop him as a character or expect his character to devolve to bashing. A lot of fics bash Ron or make him act OOC so the readers can see how dumb/angry/etc. he apparently is, which is often done by give him simple screwups. Other people give him simple screwups and sideline him almost immediately afterwards so they don't need to deal with him as a character, which is generally better, and some "redeem" him. If someone sees a fic where Ron makes dumb decisions and has previously read any of a multitude of fics where he makes dumb decisions just so he can be bashed, they're going to be understandably leery.

I'm not sure that's what they think. A large percentage of H/Hr shippers already dislike Ron for obvious reasons and are not particularly interested in writing about him.

Then there's the romance stories where he'd just be a third wheel or you have to get him together with someone else right of the bat to avoid that (which is often just as annoying). And then, even if you manage to avoid all those pitfalls, Ron is still an incredibly dull character. My hatred for Draco is probably a thousand times stronger than my slight dislike of Ron, but at least he's interesting. The only things Ron has going for him is comedic relief or a cliche badass soldierboy character - going "Grr I won't let you hurt my friends" all the time. Unless your story is about Ron from the outset and you have some unique character arc for him in mind he doesn't bring that much to the table IMHO. I've gotten pretty good at putting my dislike to the side when he is prominent in a story, but the dislike is most often just replaced by intense boredom with a one-note character.

****** I feel that's far more on poor writers than on Ron as a character. Most of the Ron-centric fics I've read have been fantastic, and Ron has enough interesting character traits and room for growth. I've honestly grown to dislike Hermione in fanfics from her constant portrayal as a supergirl who can do no wrong.

Name some please (except, "he's joe average and so relatable to a normal slacker like ourselves", because that's the opposite of interesting). The only interesting thing about Ron is that he is friends with Harry.

******** The only interesting thing about any character is their relationship to Harry. We don't necessarily care about Sirius, we care about what he and his death mean to Harry. We don't care about Seamus Finnegan, we just care that he talked shit about Harry. We don't care about Draco- he's just a brat for more than half the series and a conflicted soul for the last two books, we mostly care about him being antagonistic to Harry. If you're familiar with BnHA, there was a recent youtube video that discussed how the show is only effective able to balance its (much larger) cast by keeping them straightforward and defining them in relation to the protagonist- fanfiction can be about going beyond that, but even then you can't go beyond a certain number of characters before you stop really caring about what happens. There have been tons of longer series that have fallen prey to this, i.e. Naruto- Kishimoto's not a great storyteller, but you can see he really struggled to keep his story coherent as the cast grew. Similarly, for Bleach, Kubo explicitly said he threw in a bunch of new characters. Series that keep a much more limited cast, such as Gravity Falls, are much more adept at navigating complex character interactions.

It's also important to think of the type of story Harry Potter is- fairy tale, clear good and evil, etc. Something has to give.

Ron is the abandoned child- at least a couple fics play with him having a close relationship with Ginny before she was essentially dragged away to be the long-awaited daughter for Molly Weasley, and he doesn't really see a way to distinguish himself from his brothers (one adventurer/tombraider, one dragonkeeper, two smart pranksters/bullies, one booksmart governlment official). Ron has hobbies- he plays chess in addition to following his Quidditch dreams. From a sociology perspective, Ron acts as a connection to the wizarding world- he has been socialized there longer and is a better gateway to understanding the culture and social norms. A lot of people bash him because Rowling calls him the loyal one when he "abandoned" Harry before the first task and during the Horcrux hunt, but the first is well-explained by his character (i.e. he's in-character even when doing something the reader disagrees with) and the second is confounded by the Horcrux, which he had been wearing for weeks. He's humorous and snarky, with some great and memorable jokes from the series. You clearly don't want to hear about him being "normal," but that's a pretty valid fact and in line with how most people live life. Better yet, he's one of the only characters with whom we get a window into his emotions- we see his (childish excitement), anger, etc. We see this with Harry as the protagonist, Hagrid as an emotional individual, and eventually Dumbledore in the final book, but we really don't get to see the thought process of very many other characters. His negatives are largely a vehicle for conflict- Harry in book 4 doesn't really care for the attention, but Ron is there to raise the stakes for him and acts as a narrative device to increase interpersonal conflict- that's not a negative about him.

********* Okay this is weird. We clearly seem to have a misunderstanding in regards to the difference between "relevant to the story" and "interesting". Yes, of course in a extremely protagonist-centered story like the HP-books a character's relevance is anchored in how they relate to the protagonist (and if they don't, they don't matter to us).

An "interesting" character that I was talking about is something entirely different. Sirius is interesting in his own right: He's a pureblood outcast from a bigoted family and a rebel. He was wrongly convicted and managed to escape from one of the most secure wizarding prisons. He is intriguing. So is Voldemort (and most of the interesting stuff about him is his backstory which has almost 0 interaction with Harry). Seamus Finnigan doesn't become interesting just because he knows Harry (unless you're vain fangirl). He's still boring.

Your next paragraph deals a lot with Ron's role in the story. I understand his purpose... that - again - doesn't make him interesting. I can very well imagine an interesting pureblood-character giving the reader the inside-view into the wizarding world (fulfilling the same role): Just replace Ron with Neville and you can have pretty much the same thing, but with a more interesting character (Neville has serious struggles, not this bullshit teenage-angst about successfull older brothers, give me a brake you entitled asshole).

Being an underappreciated younger child and wanting to become a +football+ quidditch prodigy are like the most mundane things I can think of. People deal with that everyday and I have a lot more respect for those who at least give a serious attempt at trying to achieve their dreams. Is the British national Quidditch league even professional (like do they have jobs or do they play full-time?). Because if Ron - a guy who barely plays any quidditch - can have serious aspirations of playing there it has to be some kind of joke amateur league.

You are really scraping the bottom of the barrel here if you try to convince me of the merits of a character by mentioning that they have emotions. Like... whoa! ;)

*********** Agreed... it's a difficult role to write if everything hinges on the main-protagonist so much. That's probably why Ron sucks too.

If Neville plays a major part he's almost always this poor meek little puppy that Harry & friends have to nurse back to health, who doesn't take any initiative on his own.

Don't care to argue or nothing, though. No time for or interest in it. Carry on with that with the other guy if he replies.

Now take that into the magical world. The Dark Lord Ron does not need to throw obscure dark magic around like it's a hot stone, he just needs to be a figurehead of a movement. Someone else might pull the strings or work together in a sort of triumvirate, but the public sees Ron as Dark Leader.
