So the wood is outside, or how people view you without getting to know you, what you act like in a strangers company. The core is what you are at at your core, your core personality, so like if the wood is described as brash you are brash on the outside. The state(springy, spight springy, stiff) is how flexible you are to change, and adapting. The length would be how much of that personality is in you.they are your reflection basically.


** I think another viewpoint is valid concerning wand flexibility. A flexible wand is open to change, including changing wand owners, where as an unyielding wand is not open to change and not open to being owned/used by another witch or wizard

** I think that the WW had some descriptions on the elements:

- The wood represents the 'personality' of the wand;

- The core represents its inherent nature - for example a Unicorn hair wand will be less likely to turn dark arts, a Dragon heartstring core is easily swayed toward dark arts, a Phoenix feather core is shy, but very picky, however when it reveals its powers, they can be very powerful;

- The state is pretty similar to what you said;

- The length is usually proportional with the height of the wizard but a very short wand may choose a person that has a need to prove themselves, while a very long wand may choose an overconfident person.

*** Ah, then I'm just dumb bum who doesn't research. Can't believe it took this long for me to realize it.

**** No you're not. You just came up with pretty much the same thing on your own. Good job!
