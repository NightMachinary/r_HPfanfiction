What is a trending topic in ff that's pretty cool? I've read an all lives au and Dudley having a magical child, but what's another interesting topic?


** I don't think that there's any current trend. As for interesting topics, well what kind of fic do you want to read? Because what's an interesting topic for some will be an instant out for others (eg I'd rather read Malfoy being kissed by a dementor than by Hermione). There are fics where Harry is sorted into Slytherin, Bellatrix/Hermione is really popular for some reason (most of those fics aren't exactly true to canon), there are fics where Harry becomes an edgelord, there are fics where he dates Fleur, where he has a harem, where the Weasleys are traitors or the best thing since sliced bread...

So what are you looking for?
