Been reading a couple stories where Harry reunites with old friends after several years abroad. It got me thinking about a more geriatric Harry gathering together a bunch DA members to deal with some up and coming threat.

A bunch of experienced and grey witches and wizards being complaining and reminiscing as they wipe the floor with some upstart dark lord or something.

I'm imagining Ron former professional quidditch player with a body like Bagman's, mocking Neville for growing a beard that, "makes him look like dumbledore!," Neville responding, "at least I still have hair." That kind of shit.

Him and Harry complaining about the state of racing brooms these days as they outmaneuver younger fliers.

Hermione, steeped with decades of deep and esoteric magic research, being extremely respected for campaigning rights for all manor of species organizing the whole meetup and convincing people like Harry to leave his retirement.

I think there have been movies about old retired agents having to band together for something or another? I want that but with Harry Potter. A young, misguided generation who think the people who offed Voldemort are too old to be relevant anymore getting proven severely wrong. Youth vs experience, new vs old


** Dumbledore was 115 years old or something and could make Voldemort with a young body look like a student in a duel. Age is not that big of a problem for Wizards. Minerva McGonagall and Flitwick were kicking ass in the Battle of Hogwarts, with both being over 60.

Slughorn was /dueling/ Voldemort with two others and IIRC he was already a centenarian by that time.

If anything they get stronger when they age, if they keep themselves active and studying/training.

*** Dumbledore was 115 years old and voldemort considered assassinating him

which means there was not much of a chance dumbledore would croak soon from natural causes

**** Griselda Marchbanks had been one of his examiners when he was a student, and his predecessor, Armando Dippett, lived to at least 300.

** Interesting idea. I don't think wizards look at old age the way we do, however, because, put bluntly, a wizard's capacity to inflict violence doesn't really decline with age. Nobody is going to underestimate an old wizard just because of age. They don't really do retirement the way we do, either, because for them, work is largely optional in the first place, unless they want to raise children or live in luxury.

It would be interesting to see these dynamics explored.

** So this made me picture what Hermione would do/say to get Harry out of retirement, and I came up with the following:

After Molly's death, it is revealed that she left each of her kids (including Harry) a bunch of their favorite foods in stasis so even after she's gone she can still take care of them. Harry demolishes his bequeathment of treacle tart in about a month.

Ever since, other members of the Weasley family use /their/ stashes of treacle tart to bribe him into helping when he doesn't want to.

“Hey Harry, could you help me move out of my flat?”

“Hey Harry, could you make a statement with the Prophet supporting elvish welfare?”

“Hey Harry, could you and Ginny watch the kids tonight?”

Years later, the bribes stop, and Harry just assumes that they ran out. Little does he know that they all put one each away just in case they needed something BIG.

Cue this prompt.
