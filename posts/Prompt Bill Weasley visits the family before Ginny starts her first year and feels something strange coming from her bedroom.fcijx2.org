He's a curse breaker, so I'd assume he'd be able to "feel" (for lack of a better word) magic better than a lot of other people around him. And would eventually be able to locate the Horcrux.

Plus, Harry's second year is when he was trapped like a dang prisoner by the Dursley's, with bars on his windows, locks on the outside of his door, and the cat flap installed. Ron, Fred and George could be just about to rescue him, Bill stops them in their tracks and finds out about how Harry is treated at "home"

After seeing another prompt on here using Bill, I wanted another way to use him. Bill was not only underused in canon, but also in fanon unfortunately, want to see more of him.

I'd love to write it, but don't think I'm skilled enough/haven't written fanfiction in years.


** Yes, any story which actually remembers that Bill is highly trained cursebreaker (and not like the canon) is plus for me.

***** I finished it because I hate starting something and not finishing. It kinda fits the requested prompt, in that it utilizes Bill's Curse Breaking. My biggest issue is that it makes it too easy and everything just goes right. There was no real tension, just the issue with the potions. Harry and Hermione became Mary Sue's.

** People often mistook a curse breaker to be someone with natural talent and a certain, special form of intuition; the reality is much simpler and far more complicated in that.

Magic has a sort of signature, you see. To untrained witches and wizards- to those who do not pay attention- the presence of magic is subdued and even unconsciously overlooked.

It was magic that gives certain places a sense of familiarity. It's how some muggles managed to get inside the Leaky Cauldron despite not having an ounce of an idea who or what is surrounding them. It's how children, magical and non-magical alike, found themselves on the forbidden fairy path and get taken away. Magic is omnipresence, but it is not so supernatural that it is 'unreal', by any means.

The first and hardest part of being a curse breaker is simply to be able to recognize magic.

Some say the task is not unlike trying to identify the list of ingredients and spices in a dish. Others jokingly compare themselves to a sommelier, learning to pick the apart the type of spell and intentions of caster like a steward would the citrus note or oaky finish.

Bill Weasley is more inclined to compare magic signatures to music. He hears vibrant timpani in how his mother layers multiple simple household charms into something as complex a breathing organism. He remembers the lightness of flute in his father's spellwork interwoven in his collection of the muggles' artifact. Then came Charlie, Percy, the Twin, Ron and Ginny, and his household became an orchestra of laughter and chaos and /music./

Bill first realized that something has changed in Ginny from the letters she sent from Hogwarts. It wasn't the content so much as it is the ink that carried the littlest trace of magic from when Ginny had used the quill refilling charm. There was something off-tuned; something transformative and unusual to Ginny's bright marimba. There was something cold, dark, and decidedly /not/ his sister. Bill continued to ponder as the dissonance grew stronger with each letter he received.

Then, the Chamber of Secret happened. Bill's blood still boiled when he thinks about how late he was to recognize the sign of darkness.

So, Bill committed that little off-tune melody to his memory. Not only because it is what he is trained to do, but because he understands how close he comes to losing his family. The diary and Voldemort's magic influence may have been destroyed before he got to the evidence, but Bill never forgets what he's heard. Silently and nightly, he vowed to stop that strain of magic from ever coming close to his family ever again.

It was two years later, as he was waiting at the Weasleys' kitchen table when it comes back to haunt him. Bill is far too cautious to think it's his imagination playing tricks.

The emerald flame from the floo died in a flash, revealing a pair of emerald eyes behind the round glasses. Bill's heart dropped at the recognition that the dark tune is resonating from the very being of the Boy with the Lightning Scar.

--

I changed the prompt slightly to how Bill recognizes the Horcrux's magic in Ginny's diary and managed to match it to Harry's scar, I hope this is okay. The idea came to me and I can't seem to manage to twist it back into the original prompt.

I really just hope that Bill realizes quickly enough the implication that Harry is a Horcrhoux and that he proceeds to kick Dumbledore's ass.

** William "Bill" Weasley was sensitive to magic around him. So, one day while he was home, he got a shiver down his spine. He felt... Cold. Usually loving wards, the kinds that would protect you, were warmer, and got increasingly colder. However, he's never felt anything like this. This felt as if somebody turned him into ice. So he went into the closest room. Which was Ginny's room, where he had gotten even colder.

"G-Ginny? Did you bring anything unusual home today?" He asked, sitting on her bed.

"What? I found this diary, no clue where it came from though." His baby(though she wasn't a baby anymore) sister said, waving the diary. Now that he had a good look at it, he could see that it had... Something around it. He remembers seeing something like this before, but not this horrifying. He didn't want to scare his sister, but he needed to have it out of her hands. Now.

"Can I see it?" "Oh! Sure, everything I write in it disappears, so you can have it!" She said, handing it to him. Oh Merlin, she's written in it. He plastered on a smile, and spoke. "Thanks, Gin."

He swiftly left the room, his hand feeling like it was freezing down to the bone. He Flooed to Gringotts, where he knew one of his coworkers would know about this kind of thing. "Hello, can I get in contact with Senior Annabelle Dubois, quickly please." He said, however, the Goblin in front of him wasn't even looking at him, but at the little black book in his hand.

"Come. Quickly." The Goblin demanded, having Bill follow him. The former pretty much ran to the head of the rituals department, a section Bill had never seen before. Bill swiftly followed behind the shorter, when the Goblin leading him stopped. "Rankor, we request your assistance. This Human." The goblin spat. "Brought this in." Rankor noticed the book and took it from Bill.

"Very well. You were smart to bring this to me. Good job, Ward Breaker Weasley, and Teller Garnett. Both of you are dismissed." With that, the two were banashed from the room, and Bill was led out of Gringotts.

**** Bill Weasley's first day home was... Interesting. It started out normally, as any Weasley's return home could. As soon as he walked into the door he was crushed by eight Weasleys, his loving family. "Hey, what's up?"

"Tell us about curse breaking Bill!" Ginerva "Ginny," his youngest sibling and only sister said, excited.

"Okay." And that's how he spent his day, talking to his siblings, with Percy leaving the room more often than being in the room. Oh well, teenagers will be teenagers.

Did I say day earlier? I meant night. After dinner, and all of the Weasley's turned in for the night, Bill checked the wards around his home. They were all good, he could tell. He walked inside, only to find his three youngest brothers looking like deers in headlights. "What are you three doing?" Bill asked.

"Going to rescue Harry." Ron said, immediately. Fred and George both gave him the 'look' that said to 'Shut up. Right now.'

"Rescue? Why would he need to be rescued?" Bill asked.

"His aunt and uncle are really mean to him!"

"How so?" Bill quizzed. Ron shrugged.

"I dunno, he never talks about home. It's just a feeling Bill, leave it alone."

"Well Ron, I'd say we better check up on your friend. I've found that going with my gut is the best way to go." Bill said, and Ron grinned. "How are we getting there?" Bill asked.

"The Ford." Fred spoke, grinning. Moments later, they were off. Bill was driving, as he was the only one with a Drivers license (It benefitted him to do so.) As well as being the only one old enough. Once they got to Number Four Privet Drive, Bill felt... Pain. All over. So he got out, and checked the wards. There was one, a blood protection one that was quickly fading. As it was connected to Harry, Bill felt every single pain Harry felt within this house. All at once. His eyes grew, as he then rang the doorbell.

Petunia Dursley was half awake, as she stepped down the stairs. When she opened the door, she found a handsome young man, with bright red hair and hazel eyes. "Hello?" She asked, groggily.

"Yes, is Harry Potter here?" The man asked. A sneer grew on Petunia's face.

"What do you want with that delinquent?" She asked.

"Well, I believe its time to relieve you of your duty to take care of him. And I would like to thank you for taking care of my cousin." Bill said, smoothly lying. About the cousin thing.

"Good Riddance. The boy is a problem child to begin with, and we'll be happy to have him gone. I'll go retrieve him."

Bill stood as the horse-faced woman walked up the stairs. Moments later, Harry FREAKING POTTER walked down the stairs, but Bill smiled. "Harry! I haven't seen you since you were a baby! You're quite dashing, if I do say so myself. Come along, if we wish to be home before sunrise we must leave immediately! Do you have everything?" Harry, confused, just nodded, not trusting his mouth. Bill smiled again at Petunia. "Thank you again for taking care of him, we must be off now!" Bill then took Harry to the car, where the child brightened up seeing Ron and the twins. Bill got into the drivers seat and drove to the Burrow, handling his mothers temper, as the younger children were off to bed. After Bill was sure that the children were asleep, he explained everything to his mother, and both vowed to keep Harry out of the Dursley home. It worked.

*** Once Albus tells Bill about the blood protection surrounding the house, I'm sure Bill won't care after what he sees at the house, and Harry treated like a prisoner/captive instead of a kid. And will either get his parents to raise Harry, he'll do it himself, or he'd find someone he trusts to do it. Maybe Tonks? Since in fanon they're often friends, no idea how close to canon Bill and Tonks being friends actually is though, but it's fanon, we can play with that idea.
