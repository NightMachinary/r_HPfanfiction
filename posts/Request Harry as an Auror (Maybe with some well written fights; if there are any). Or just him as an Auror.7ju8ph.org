Looking for any Harry as an Auror stories with some interesting cases, can be as canon or as AU as possible. Would be interesting to see some well written fights that don't make you want to cringe, if there are any at possible.

Any rating is fine, am fine with het/slash/femslash. No character bashing. No Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione but any other pairing is fine.

Would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine.

** I was asking around for this exact thing a few months ago, and this is an exceptionally good one: "The Aurors" by FloreatCastellum. Harry takes a young, peppy rookie under his wing - just as a murder spree targeting former Death Eaters takes off. I love this story, especially since it gives an indication of the tensions that might exist within the Auror department following the Second Wizarding War, as new Aurors like Harry uneasily team up with the Aurors who worked in the DE-controlled puppet Ministry.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11815544/1/]])

Next, there's this one that I was made aware of a few days ago, which is also an interesting concept: what if there were a case going on that impacted both Muggle and Wizarding worlds and required them to work together - and what if Harry's Muggle counterpart at Scotland Yard was none other than his cousin Dudley?

As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon...

** /A Foreign Language/ by FarenMaddox -- linkffn(3801134) -- has an interesting mystery, though not much fighting. Harry and Draco are Aurors and work together to investigate a dangerous magical drug that is becoming popular among students at a Muggle school in the USA. The rebellious students, some of whom have difficult family situations, are interesting original characters, which is good because there are a lot of them. Harry's first appearance in the story is in “Chapter 4: A Saving People Thing”.

The story is a sequel to two other stories that also feature Harry and Draco working together on a mystery, but I didn't like those other stories as much. I think you should be able to start at this story without too much confusion.
