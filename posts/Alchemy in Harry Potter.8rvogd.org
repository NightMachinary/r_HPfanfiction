** I see alchemy as the "better" counterpart to Transfiguration which produces permanent and true substance. Transfigured Gold is stable, but if anyone suspects that it's not real gold, they can just use an Untransfiguration spell and return it to whatever it was formerly; this is the reason you can't make true food with Transfiguration (because a wizard's magic has a built-in trigger response to Untransfigure anything it consumes) and that Transfigured gold is worthless.

With Alchemy, you make /real/ substance, which can never be reverted to its previous state; this enables creation of true gold with the Philosopher's Stone, and "human transfiguration" which perenially makes you younger and healthier (whereas, again, the body's magic rebels against Transfigured or Polyjuiced changes and you have to keep reapplying the magic every few hours).

As to how it's practiced... it's more akin to Potions than Transfiguration, I suppose, but it uses test tubes and glass phials and things, so to speak. I picture it as a child's idea of chemistry, you know, looking like [[https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5c/39/f4/5c39f4962481e7e04522cdbaeb16521a.jpg][that]], with all sorts of colorful liquids and funny items. Much as in potions the ingredients would, of course, be odd and often magical in nature. (Dragon's Blood, for instance...)

*** I suspect that in canon you cannot Transfigure other objects into gold, otherwise the Philosopher's Stone's ability to Transfigure any metal to gold is a lot less noteworthy, yet Ron at least made it seem especially... special.

**** Well my headcanon is that you /can/ theoretically (though the specific spell to do so has probably been long discarded for being useless, someone like Dumbledore could play it by ear and succeed), but any savvy buyer in the Wizarding World would cast some Untransfiguration charms on the stuff before accepting it, and then you'd be thrown in Azkaban for counterfeiting. So while theoretically possible transfiguring gold would not be an "option". From there, as I said, the general populace would sort of forget it was ever possible in the first place. Like how a random IRL kid wouldn't necessarily know that transmuting lead into gold /is/ possible if you've got a nuclear plant (because all projects to do so were abandoned when we realized it would be more expensive than the gold's worth).

** Pretty much Potions-based transfiguration. In canon (as with historical alchemy), it's primarily concerned with creating a Philosopher's Stone, which can Transfigure any metal into gold (which normal transfiguration cannot, presumably because it's an exception to Gamp's Law of Fundamental Transfiguration) and create Elixir of life.

This, as a description of real, historical alchemy, is approximately as accurate as describing biology as being primarily concerned with placing organisms, by twos, into jars and observing which devours the other.

Harry Potter alchemy uses the 'philosopher's stone lets you make gold and live forever' version, but that's what three eleven-year-olds learn from a school library.

Venturing into a mix of headcanon and the actual, attested work of alchemists from 300CE onward, alchemy is the study of the change of substances from one to another - /cheirokmeta/ - the nature of substances, and the reflections of the spiritual in the material.

(To do this they had to discover a lot of chemistry, and also invent a lot of lab equipment. If you've ever used a bain-marie, it's named after the alchemist credited with inventing it, the woman only referred to as Mary The Jewess or Mary The Prophet. Although she wasn't credited with it until about a thousand years after she died, so your mileage may vary. She's the oldest known alchemist, and the alchemists liked to attribute their stuff to the Wisdom Of The Ancients, so quite a lot gets credited to her. The distillation apparatuses she designed are attributed a lot closer to her lifetime.)

So alchemy with real magic involved is the study of the exoteric and esoteric properties of matter and the reactions of substance with substance, effecting transmutation and transfiguration using, and giving rise to, the inherent magic of the universe as expressed in matter, and the interactions of that magic with the alchemist's own spiritual and material self. Alchemists are careful to only speak of the ultimate goal in riddles, talking of the 'Great Work', the 'Elixir', the 'Philosopher's Stone' and 'Alkahest', implying that there is some danger in arriving at the knowledge at the heart of alchemy without discovering it personally.

On this basis, the stone in the mirror behind the teachers' defences was never the thing that Tom Riddle truly sought. He had learned the Dark Arts, but nothing of the Great Work, so he did not understand that there never really was A Stone, he could only seek, and create, his own stone. Whether or not he could do so without purifying himself of the foul transmutations he had worked upon himself, we cannot say, except to hope not. Fortunately, all he knew of the Great Work was the storybook version.

General footnote: magic and alchemy are some of the best bits of history and anthropology. I recommend the study of it to absolutely everyone, and people interested in the magic of Harry Potter in particular. The stories behind the folklore JKR used to create her world are generally at least interesting if not outright mind-expanding.

Your response annoys me a bit, as entertaining and informative as it is. The other goals you mentioned (the alkahest, the "great work") are nearly always connected with the creation of the Philosopher's Stone in alchemic discussions in European history, which was my point, as that's what HP draws on. The religious and mystic connections aren't really connected to HP.

** I'm still iffy on how exactly make alchemy work in technical terms, but the gist of my version is that where transfiguration is transformation of the physical, alchemy seeks to use eclectic set of methods to transform magical.

** People are lazy. Lazy authors take the FMA concept and try to fit it into the HPU. Which doesnt work.

Imo: Alchemy in HPU is neither transfiguration nor potionswork nor science. It is a blend of all disciples that does not follow any already established rules. It does what it does. How it works is the job of the Alchemist to find out.

However from reaching conclusions based on what we know about Alchemy in HPU it can be said that Alchemy is not as useful overall, to the common wizard / witch.

** My headcanon is that alchemy is similar to potions (with potions actually being a sub-discipline of alchemy), but instead of making liquids, you make solids and semi-solids.

** Huh. I didn't realise my personal headcanon about Alchemy was so different to the norm. I think of it as being very philosophical, and very much about the nature of things. In my AU I followed the Platonic model of Forms and Matter. Think of Matter as being the stuff it's made of, and Form being the object's inherent essence. So most of the time, Magic manipulates the Forms of an object, and the Matter changes to reflect this. But it can't alter the Form completely, only impress your Will upon it to twist and shape it. Alchemy looks at, among other things, the study and true manipulation of Form.

Here are some ideas for things which I think come under alchemy:

- The study of how physical and chemical transformation can affect Form
- The purification of Form; Idealising substances.
- Philosophy of where Concepts come from, and whether they can exist without Matter.
- The Nature of the Soul (it is in many ways the complex Form of a person)

** My headcannon is that alchemy is doing microscopic transfigurations using charms.

You could easily transfigure yarn into cloth, but if you charm it into weaving itself into cloth, then you get utterly mundane cloth using magic.

So alchemy would be the same. Using charms to vanish protons and neutrons to turn lead into gold makes utterly non-magical gold.
