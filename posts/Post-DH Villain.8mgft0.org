Hi! I'm planning to write a Next Gen fanfic that won't quite follow CC, and I wanted to ask for your opinion on what type of character would make a great villain. I know they could be someone looking for revenge after Voldemort's defeat, but I wanted to have someone who's not that. I'm thinking of having someone who as the child of a Death Eater suffered the backlash of being related to someone like that. Do you think the Slytherin prejudice (or the House prejudice in general) would have stayed, at least until maybe a few years after the war? Thoughts? Suggestions? Opinions? I'd love to hear it. Thank you :)

*** Interesting! Although I'm not quite sure how you would destroy magic itself. I suppose it's impossible, or maybe possible through mass murder... but if you just supress magic, everyone would turn into Obscurials or pseudo-Obscurials... hmm...

Thanks though :)

*** Destroying magic sounds a little too far fetched, but destroying the existing magical establishment using Muggles seems more reasonable.

Nuking the Quidditch World Cup final, where up to 20% of world's Wizards are congregated in one spot, could be the opening move of this new Dark Lord.

Harry, Ginny, Ron, and most of their clan perish in this attack. Hermione and ASP, who don't like Quidditch and did not attend that event, survive and must now carry on the fight.

*** Makes plenty of sense. In the grand sweep of history, the next Voldemort is only a matter of time. And he or she might not be stopped.

It's not as if magic benefits humanity as a while in any way. It doesn't even benefit Wizards that much - for most it's just an alternative to technology for doing day-to-day stuff.

But it definitely puts too much power in the hands of flawed human beings, so it's not as if its destruction would be no loss. Perhaps there's some McGuffin in the department of Mysteries that could do that..

** I think you have to be careful with post-Hogwarts villains.

If they're too strong, they step on Voldemort's toes. Voldemort was supposed to be the kind of big bad who only comes along very rarely. It would cheapen him as a villain, and Harry's actions in the war, if another, similar figure appeared shortly after.

However, if you make them too weak, you have the opposite problem: the reader ends up frustrated that Harry, who was able to beat Voldemort, is struggling to deal with someone much weaker than Voldemort.

The solution, I think, is to simply tell a different type of story. Making the villain be clever, not powerful, and make the threat they pose be political rather than violent.

*** I do want to make them clever. I'm much more interested to write someone whose not too powerful, since that stops me from accidentally creating a Mary Sue-esque character. Thanks for the new perspectives :)

** To be honest, the Death Eater or Death Eater's relatives that come back to get revenge is getting a little bit old. I'd love to see a totally original villain that had nothing to do with Voldemort. One that is charismatic and powerful, a little bit like Tom Riddle (young).

*** It's not really the revenge that's motivating them. It's more of the prejudice and backlash that came after. A little like Scorpius's situation where people assume that he's going to be like his father. They want to stop it and change, and they even did everything they can to show that, but nobody seems to understand and suspects they have ulterior motives or something. So they turn cynical and bitter and decide to turn on the world like it did on them (or something along those lines). I think that's still revenge or revenge-esque? But not because they wanna bring the Dark lord back or something. It's based heavily on the concept that villains are made, not born. I hope that made sense... hehe... I should probably edit the question... Thanks for the input though :)

**** I see what you mean... Maybe you can try a muggleborn dark lord/villain. One who fought against Voldemort and lost a lot of friends. He thought that now that Voldemort was gone, Muggleborns would have more rights but nothing changed. So he decided to make the changes the hard way. I just love villains who have good reasons to act :p

** It could be foreign intervention against another dark lord wannabe with Horcruxes. Only this time, the villain used mundane objects and dumped them in truly inaccessible locations. On the other hand, this villain was not as powerful as Voldemort.

** One my personal favs is when a muggleborn or Order member decides to take revenge and specifically targets purebloods and/or DeathEaters and their families (Scorp!!).

Or perhaps a disenfranchised muggleborn who resorts to terrorism.

**** Yeah I once read an interesting next gen scorose auror fic where (I think) they were setting up a villain who was trying to use science to steal magic from wizards, possibly to make himself one? It was incomplete at the time so I'm not sure where it was going.

***** Someone related to a Muggle Prime Minister, probably, because there would be a chance that they know of the existence of magic. Maybe even the Prime Minister themselves... or someone who witnessed magic, and wasn't Obliviated.. or a Squib... That would be interesting..

***** Huh. I don't read Dramione so I didn't know that. Muggleborn would be more plausible for me than an Order member personally but that's because there's not much of them left now... though a Weasley villain is a scarily interesting thought...

** For my villain, it's someone who blames Harry for leading children into battle. They're not even related to the Death Eaters. Really, they just became the leader of the opposing side by accident.

*** Interesting... It wasn't exactly Harry though... it's more of Dumbledore who did that, I think. I think that would be nice, someone who didn't like Dumbledore after it was somehow revealed how questionable some of his actions were or maybe read his history in general (aka believed a bit of Skeeter's /The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore/). But seeing as it was Harry who seemed to be the center of the war, maybe someone who hates him because of that...

Anyway, thank you :)

**** No problem!

Also, the villain chose Harry because 1) it's much easier to blame someone who is alive than someone who is dead and 2) Harry was viewed as the leader of the DA, some of whom died during the Final Battle.

Good luck on your story!

** I would try to consider the current political climate. After all, Grindelwald and Voldemort only became power because there was enough political backing to make them powerful. You could have a villain that wishes to restore wizarding society values... or perhaps on the other side of the spectrum where the villain is a tragic villain where a character affected by death eater attacks begins killing pure bloods, regardless of economic level.
