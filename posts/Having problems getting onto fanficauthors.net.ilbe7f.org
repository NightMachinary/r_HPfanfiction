I was reading White knight Grey lady on fanfiauthors when it suddenly wont load, ive tried multiple ways of getting it to work but it just wont happen. Can you tell me how to fix this or if you are having the same problem?


** I've been having the same problem since this morning. Probably the site is down, not sure there's anything we can do about it.

** It always seemed like the authors on the site hadn't uploaded in years - at least, according to the home page, the last real update was like, four years ago. I'm honestly surprised they even still pay for the hosting for it.
