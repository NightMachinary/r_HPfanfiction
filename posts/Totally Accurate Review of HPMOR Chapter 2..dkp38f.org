So normal disclaimer, this was written for fun not to egg on people that like HPMOR, you like or dislike what you like and no one can take that away from you...unless it's the government.

Some Patch Notes From Chapter 1 to fix mistakes that I made in my deranged tired state last night.

#+begin_quote
  Harry's nerd castle of books is actually NOT his room, it's his living room, that just means his entire family are Hermione and he doesn't know it yet.

  The Communist Manifesto is apparently not a big ass book like I assumed, I have to turn in my history major because I thought this, but in my defense I'd rather read Twilight and Fifty Shades of Gray back to back and wash it all down with a healthy dose of My Immortal before I read the Communist Manifesto.

  People really like the Idea of Petunia being a Horse.

  I got a reviewer and the Author Mixed up, shows how much of a fan I am of his work.
#+end_quote

Now on with the show!

Chapter 2 opens up with Harry explaining the scientific method to his Parents, one of whom is a biochemist and really should know this by now.

McGonagall during this entire explanation is sitting through the explanation looking at her watch thinking about how her weekday is being wasted.

When Harry finally gives her the OK to begin the experiment she levitates Harry's father, both Harry and notvernon under react to this revelation.

So to blow their goddamn minds McGonagall transforms into a cat and Harry proceeds to lose his goddamn mind.

Not in a good way either like in a Pope just found out the world was Round kind of way, the only thing missing are the executions and excommunications that normally coincide with such revelations.

On a side note we get probably the funniest interaction in this entire fic.

#+begin_quote
  "You turned into a cat! A SMALL cat! You violated Conservation of Energy! That's not just an arbitrary rule, it's implied by the form of the quantum Hamiltonian! Rejecting it destroys unitarity and then you get FTL signalling! And cats are COMPLICATED! A human mind can't just visualize a whole cat's anatomy and, and all the cat biochemistry, and what about the neurology? How can you go on thinking using a cat-sized brain?"

  Professor McGonagall's lips were twitching harder now. "Magic."

  "Magic isn't enough to do that! You'd have to be a god!"

  Professor McGonagall blinked. "That's the first time I've ever been called that."
#+end_quote

After this we find out that Harry doesn't go to school, mainly because he can't sleep proper hours...I don't even think this is a real thing, so basically he falls asleep 2 hours later each night. So if he goes to bed at 10 PM the next night he'll fall asleep at 12 AM. Why his parents haven't pumped him full of sleep aids and melatonin I have no clue.

He's also a conscientious objector to child conscription, meaning he doesn't like school because the teachers suck and the schools don't provide adequate learning materials.

so discounting the fact that he is 11 years old and shouldn't even fucking know what a Conscientious Objector is, I dislike this version of Harry ALOT and it's only been 2 chapter.

See, the reason we like boy geniuses like Dexter and Jimmy Neutron is because they are still Kids, they still at like Kids and they still make childish mistakes. Harry in this story does not act like a child, he acts like a grown ass man and it's the same mistake most Heir Potter stories do.

Also this kid bit a teacher because she didn't know what a /logarithm/ was, keep in mind He was 7 at the time that means at least in the American School System he was a Kindergartner/first grader, he expected his 1st grade teacher to know what a logarithm was and explain it to her first grade class when you usually don't even learn it until SENIOR YEAR OF HIGHSCHOOL.

With that rant out of the Way, McGonagall decides the same thing I did, that Harry is a walking time bomb and shouldn't be allowed human contact, I jest but she does say that she's going to take Harry shopping right before Hogwarts, so he can't science his house out of existence.

******** His idea of rationality is ‘doing the best with what you got'. Basically this means that you form the best possible beliefs with the evidence you've got and make the best possible choices to tackle a problem or situation.

A popular view of rationality is when you completely disregard your emotions and intuitions, because you ‘cannot trust them'. Popular literature and movies often have these characters, a good example is Spock form Star Trek. He's always cold and logical, doesn't let his emotions overcome him - and gets outmaneuvered when meeting a completely random, “irrational” opponent.

I actually prefer the author's version of rationality. Or rather, a mesh of the two. Emotions and intuitions can be quite useful (they can also backfire), and most of us cannot disregard them (should we, even), so why bother. But carefully analyzing situations is also very important.

********* To me, naming a method 'rationality' when it isn't following what most people would see as 'rational' (eg, logical) is a bad idea - it's a misnomer. For instance, I don't find the author's Friendly/Bad AI takes to be particularly rational - but I'm sure he'd include those in his list of rational takes.

In addition, from the perspective of the fic itself, Harry makes a /lot/ of leaps to conclusions - in how magic works, in his exploration of the world, in his strategies... They might work out often, but that's because the author is writing it that way - it doesn't make the way he acts 'rational' to me.

I'd 100% be reacting differently to it if it were presented not as 'rationality' but by some other name, as well. Perhaps I just have higher standards for lack of subjective beliefs in something that describes itself as rational, I don't know. Because in many cases, I wouldn't say that that Harry carefully analyzes situations and runs an analysis on them, or compares different approaches, or runs experiments - most of the time, what I remember thinking was that it was like he made a decision from thinking a bit, and it happened to be right through author fiat.

** I totally knew what a conscientious objector was by the time I was 11. My goon show tapes would have been well worn to death by then, so likely was in the habit of listening to Dad's Army on radio 4 (and other stuff). Mainwaring was livid when he found out Godfrey was one of those cowards in the previous war.

Joking aside, knowing what a conscientious objector is at age 11 is not amazing.

I have a vague suspicion that Harry biting his logarith-ignorant teacher is supposed to be his way of being an idiot 7 year old. He has all that math in his head but hasn't yet learnt that the adults are not all supposed to be more advanced versions of himself.

Also, come to think of it, yes Harry did sound way too old for his age throughout the fic, even well before the traumatic event that is supposed to make him mentally age prematurely.

Possibly the strangest thing about this interaction is how incredibly unimaginative Harry is, where he jumps onto the first explanation he can possibly think of to understand what's happening and immediately assumes that must be how reality works. This character trait is completely unremarked upon, but continuously pops up throughout the story and really damages the credibility of the story as pedagogy. (See: the mokeskin bag, ghosts, resurrection stone, etc etc etc)

There are so many possibilities of human-animal transformation that don't require all that dumbass jargon spewing. Maybe McGonagall's body gets shunted to a magical plane and is replaced by a cat she controls remotely? Maybe the cat is her familiar and she can just switch places with it? Hell, he didn't even check if she just /made an illusion/ of herself turning into a cat and is still sitting invisibly on the couch.

But no, she MUST have transformed into a cat! Hamilton signalling!! Unitarianism!!!

I wasn't so much belittling Harry in this comment as much as the people that glorify this fic and think that by liking it that it means they're also a deep thinker and great scientist. It does not, as one of the biggest plot points is that the Harry in this story---for all of his reading, his claims of scientific reasoning, his rationality---does not think like a scientist. He has a completely rigid and almost binary method of looking at the world, and this is exploited multiple times throughout the story.

Also, the science references in this fic has cut closer to being a wikipedia article with Harry Potter characters wrapped around it while reenacting Ender's Game. You can, of course, look further into those if you're interested.

****** Also, in my previous answer I tried to say that Harry making mistakes is completely normal. If the author wrote him deliberately this way. I understand that many people view his character as the one who educates us about scientific and rational thinking. And it can be definitely confusing when Harry contradicts his own teaching.

But he mostly read a bunch of books and research papers. It's a whole another thing to know the theory and apply it in real life. In my own experience at least. Now you could say that maybe I'm just not cut out to be a scientist and that's why it's hard for me. And you might be right, there are times when I'd even agree with you.

But sometimes even accomplished professors mess up. There are books and papers about how most scientists wrongly use statistical analysis methods (sometimes even deliberately to get better results) and how their inferences are inherently flawed. And wrong interpretation of results are a whole another thing.

So all I wanted to say that good scientific work is damn hard. I just worded it really badly and I am sorry about that.

You like the story and you have a soft spot for it, that's great! There are many stories and things I hold a soft spot for as well! However the twisting that you're doing to try to and justify why you like it (there's nothing inherently /wrong/ with liking something) is illustrating many of the reasons that other people don't.

You don't need to be defensive about liking it. It's great that you do and that it's done--apparently--great things for your life having been exposed to it! People disliking the story, it's presentation, and things surrounding it does not invalidate what it is to you.

But yes, I did miss your point and I regret that I didn't think through properly what I wanted to convey (also, weak excuse that it was around 2:30 am here and my brain was a mush).

I just feel like that this fanfiction gets an unnecessary amount of bad rep just because a subset of it's readers behave in a certain way (like you described, I also stumbled upon those individuals). But I don't think it's fair. It should get bad rep for it's own mistakes. And it does. :D

**** Point on the comed-tea, but having that kind of realization towards the end is pretty weaksauce for what was ultimately supposed to be an educational work about the "methods of rationality". Reading a story and the main character goes "Oops! I've been doing things wrong this whole time. Better learn better for next time! The end," is not really helping the reader learn anything.

I can't speak for what other people describe as absurd or not, but I agree commenting on Harry's unrealistic vocabulary is missing the point--he's supposed to be a mouthpiece for the author, so being able to communicate those views is expected. To me, the absurd things occur when the author tract bulldozes over any semblance of characterization or narrative flow.

So the things that kill MoR for me are events like:

- McGonagall, a middle-aged teacher with decades of experience dealing with kids and teenagers (not to mention member of a semi-secret paramilitary group), gets constantly sassed, insulted, and blackmailed by a precocious little turd, and just kind of accepts it all with a stiff upper lip and bluster.

- Draco Malfoy, a high-class socialite groomed by multiple tutors and his parents in manipulation and charisma, decides to mention to a boy he's talked to for all of an hour about how he wants to rape his future classmate.

- The entire SPHEW thing just... existing.

I disagree. I think it's a really important lesson, that pretty much everyone gets things wrong. It doesn't invalidate the lessons the story was teaching, because Harry did know some good principles, but for all that, he still fell way short of his own ideals. And that is normal, and anyone who really wants to be a rationalist needs to be ready to acknowledge when they themselves have entirely failed to be properly rational.

- In chapter 19 Quirrell forces Harry to acknowledge the mistake of his absurd overreaction to Snape in the first Potions class.
- In chapter 22 Hermione proves that Harry was conceited to assume that he could reach a scientific understanding of the nature of magic with just a few quick experiments at the age of 11.
- Hermione proves that Harry's dismissive attitude toward his classmates is wrong in chapter 30 when she and her team win the first battle against him.
- In chapter 50 Flitwick points out that Harry's convoluted method of dealing with one of his classmates was unethical and unhealthy.
- Harry realizes how stupid he has been after his flawed reasoning leads to the fiasco of chapters 52 to 60.
- At the end of chapter 82 Harry realizes what a hypocrite he has been in a recent conversation with someone who doesn't deserve his ire.
- Harry's dismissive attitude towards other people is proven wrong once again when he fails to gain their support at a critical moment in chapter 88. In particular, the author uses that scene to demonstrate how Harry's attitudes towards Hagrid and Ron are wrong. That whole arc forces Harry to acknowledge numerous mistakes in his reasoning because he failed on a number of levels.

Those are just the cases that spring to mind at the moment, but there are many more instances of the author using the narrative in HPMOR to point out Harry's mistakes.

******* But that's just the thing. Sure, it's fun to read about Harry being 'superior' to everyone else, but at the end of the day, he /doesn't learn/ until the end. Most of your examples of Harry's mindset being wrong focus on how he's arrogant and has a god complex in regards towards people around him. Sure, it all comes crashing down on his head at the end, but that's still a good 100 chapters of essentially a static character who keeps making the same mistakes despite supposedly being smart.

Harry in HPMOR has all these high ideals of applying ethics and social psychology etc. to his daily life, but, like a typical person, there's a huge gap between Harry understanding something on a cognitive level and being able to carry through on those principles when stuck in emotionally charged situations (or when his ego gets in the way). It's realistic for people to often fail at being rational, and its realistic for there to often be negative consequences as there were in the fic.

That's completely fair.

I just wish he'd caught himself in the act of making the same sort of arrogant blunder just once, or maybe had some reflection on why he keeps making the same mistakes. (That's part of the reason I think Significant Digits is a decent sequel, honestly--it has an older, wiser Harry who understands the cost of arrogance.)

I would've liked some 'show, don't tell' with regards to character development. It's been a while since I've read HPMOR, but do you recall any parts where he does that before the end?

Because otherwise, he's kind of a static protagonist, and while that's fun for the first 50 chapters or so, it doesn't feel as fun when the stakes rise.

Same to you. If you haven't read Significant Digits yet, I do recommend it. It's no longer centered solely around Harry and plays with the sandbox of the HPMOR world, but it's undeniably a very different sort of fic. It approaches literature more than most fanfic, in some ways.

******* Many of those moments felt like false modesty signalling to me, designed by the author after either having read objective criticism or just having modeled the average reader that has gone through one too many smug-Harry chapters.

These scenes mostly also either don't matter in the grand scheme of things, or /would/ have mattered if Harry actually learned something from his own previous acknowledged mistakes. From your own comment, Hermione confronts him about his flawed reasoning in chapter /22/, and then in chapters /52--60/ his flawed reasoning leads to another fiasco.

#+begin_quote
  he jumps onto the first explanation he can possibly think of to understand what's happening and immediately assumes that must be how reality works. This character trait is completely unremarked upon, but continuously pops up throughout the story and really damages the credibility of the story as pedagogy.

This is a really great point for OP to make about HPMOR, in my opinion. HPMOR initially introduced itself as a tool that would storify various pieces of useful knowledge --- like the scientific method, common biases, etc. Yet the only (more or less) true experiment I can remember him conducting was the bloodline strength research that he did with Malfoy. In his other important experiments:

- partial transfiguration of large solid objects (the wall) --- he thinks really hard for a few hours (I think) --- without doing any proper research or experimentation --- and magicaly comes to the right conclusion to figure out how it works, and to instantly become able to perform it.
- Patronus 2.0 --- again, right when he is already facing a crisis, he /thinks really hard/ and magically produces a 100% correct hypothesis of how dementors work and dementor-killing patronus spell should work. He again doesn't need to do any proper research, data gathering, hypothesis pruning and testing to arrive at this correct final answer, and he again becomes able to use the recently deduced spell / knowledge in the first several hours.
- time travel --- he plays with it for a little bit, gets a magical warning on a slip of paper, and then that's it. He does neither any practical experimentation about it (even ones that would've been safe because of him knowing that people like Hermione routinely abuse a time turner like that with no ill effects) nor any theoretical work about it.

For a work that was supposed to demonstrate and explain the true nature and value of scientific method, he surprisingly often butchers it and uses it as a cargo cult. And you can't have it both ways either. Either "HPMOR sucks when judged just as a work of entertainment because it's supposed to be educational first and entertaining second", or "Harry fails to clearly demonstrate the things he himself is trying to teach because he should be a believable character". There wasn't even any reason for these two statements to conflict: the story could've been told from /someone else's/ point of view --- a character's that has already recognised that knowing something and being able to do it is not the same thing, and has also learned to do it themselves and that can be used by the author to properly explain, and demonstrate all these important ideas that the author is meaning to convey.

I do think that HPMOR had a great influence as a genre-builder and as a propagator of certain types of knowledge (e.g. " these cognitive biases exist!", "scientific method is useful and cool", etc). But I also think it would've been great if either HPMOR itself stayed true to its initial promise, or if some other author / story appeared to take what HPMOR failed to do and weave it into a better story.

** Please review every chapter in this style; it's much preferable to reading it oneself! I have mixed feelings on HPMOR, as it was in fact the fic that got me into the fandom (and Partially Kissed Hero nearly took me right back out, but that's another story). So while I have good memories of the fic from my first time reading it, I just can't bear reading it again, as the way it's written is nigh-unbearable at times.

That said, I do really appreciate the climax of the story, particularly where Voldemort is explaining his plan and the world to Harry. The worldbuilding is excellent, and it comes the closest to living up to the promise of a more rational Harry Potter universe. Of course, then the actual ending is really abrupt and to me, quite unsatisfying.

I have no idea about the British system, but the system here actually has teachers go through introductory mathematics. Logarithms aren't taught to kids, but I'd assume a first grade teacher (no such thing, either, you are either a grade 1 to 4, 5 to 9, or 5 to 12/13 teacher here, but anyway) to know what a logarithm is. Heck, I asked my spouse, whose a licensed adult language teacher, and she had simple analysis as a requirement to get her license to teach German, English, and Russian at state vocational schools.

But anyway I locked myself into a toilet stall when I wasn't "allowed" to read a book by myself when I was unhappy about having to sound out letters when I had been reading (some children's) books since I was four in first grade. So it's not /that/ far fetched for a freakopath like that Harry to overreact.

I don't actually know who that is, so that's not going to be hard. Though I suspect if I say something that's similar to that other person I'll just be accused of parroting them anyway. Conservation of energy is the principle that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted into one form or another. So Harry is right that a full sized human woman turning into am average size cat means a decrease in mass without any obvious output of the excess energy (since the mass-energy equivalence essentially means mass is a form of energy in itself.) The 'quantum Hamiltonian' (which I'm assuming is the Hamiltonian operator relating to quantum mechanics since 'quantum Hamiltonian' is not a term I'd use for that, I'd just stick with regular ol' 'Hamiltonian operator') is the sum of all the kinetic and potential energies for all the particles in a system. However, and this is a key issue, quantum mechanics relates to particles no larger than an atom. There is zero reason to witness a human-to-cat transformation and bring up quantum mechanics. Nothing he said is actually /wrong/ per se, it's just a baffling direction to go. It would be like someone showing you a car engine and you started talking to them about rocket science; they're related concepts sure, but there's a big gulf between them.

I didn't need to google anything for my reply, so I guess I had that disadvantage; when you're studying quantum theory anyhow you don't need to put 'quantum' in front of everything unless you're Hank Pym.

And if you notice closely, I never backpedalled on anything. My point stands more than it ever did; it seems more like Yudkowsky himself googled stuff on the principle of conservation of energy and stuck it into the story without any regard for whether or not it was appropriate. Because intelligence is more than just memorising a bunch of facts, you need to be able to apply those facts in a relevant manner. Which quite frankly, he didn't.

********* You know, attacking a person instead of their argument isn't a particularly good strategy. If I cared enough I could go get my certificate out of the box and show you (covering up personal details, obviously), but even if I did, would that give anything I said more weight? Of course not, the reasoning behind an argument isn't related to the person giving it. Now, you'll probably go on the same lines you did before, saying my refusal to prove my degree is then proof that somehow, everything I said is wrong and/or hypocritical. But unless you can actually /respond/ to any of the arguments I've made rather than dragging the conversation around on tangents then there's no point to this either way. Remember, intelligence isn't just about reading through an encyclopedia. You need to be able to /apply/ that knowledge.

...no I didn't. At all. I said the things he was saying were /scientifically correct/, they just had little to no relation to what he was actually talking about. As if, and I will say it again, he just memorised these science facts and was spouting them off with no understanding of what they actually /meant/ or how he could relate them to the story. There's no reason to get into quantum theory here, everything is working on an entirely macroscopic scale. I even said before, it's like if someone showed you how they improved their car engine and you started relating it to rocket science. Sure, you're probably right, but what does it have to do with the topic at hand?

And as far as I can remember, I haven't mentioned studying QM in a reddit comment before, for this exact reason; saying 'I have a degree in Quantum Mechanics' doesn't prove anything. I once mentioned I took a course in Astronomy though, if that helps. It was that or Advanced Statistics, and I hate Statistics.\\

  To continue with the comment since i was driving at the time, I do agree that doing this chapter by chapter is a stupid idea, especially with how popular and divisive this story actually is, people love this story and people hate this story and i'm getting a lot of both in both of these threads. So I'm probably going to force myself to read through it and write an actual well thought out and at least edited review for HPMOR, I did have fun writing out these two threads, but they are low hanging fruit and I can do better with more valid criticism that doesn't just kneecap the source material for cheap laughs.

However, the bystander effect doesn't apply to geopolitics, it applies to interpersonal relations. By applying a person-to-person psychological phenomenon to countries, Harry does bad science.

I don't know about you, but let's use statistics jargon incorrectly the same way that this fic does. My null hypothesis is that Harry Potter fanfiction usually doesn't contain any correct science. This fic has done nothing to show that +it is different from any others in that regard+the science it provides should be trusted authoritatively.

Regardless, I'm not going to provide any more examples mainly because I get the feeling you'd want me to go through the whole fic myself. Which I won't. Because as snarky as su3su2su1 was, it doesn't take a genius to point out that someone's science is wrong.

Perhaps you could elaborate on this for me? It's not clear to me what you think he's teaching. I think he's trying to teach the Bystander Effect in that passage, but gives two examples, one of which is the study itself, the other of which relates more indirectly to the idea of diffusion of responsibility but is not a direct application of the bystander effect and so would be highly misleading to anyone hearing about the bystander effect for the first time.

I don't consider that good teaching, but maybe you had something else in mind.

Anyways, sorry, I was using a paraphrase. I believe your exact words were 'relatively literal-minded' and that 'a big part of intelligence is recognizing patterns and making associations that most people wouldn't make'. Is it that much of a 'divergent' logical leap to believe that you're implying that people without these thinking processes are simple minded?

And yes, I would greatly appreciate an example. I would like to put one caveat: I will not count uses of the phrase 'bystander effect' from politicians or other people without psychology backgrounds, as you said you would find an example of psychology professors. I believe this is a reasonable restriction since you're going for an appeal to authority and we wouldn't want to go too far out of bounds.

************* Okay. You are correct. Some psychology professors use the term 'bystander effect' in the context of individuals and their beliefs that their nations should or shouldn't interfere in foreign conflicts such as genocide.

While I don't want to get into yet another pedantic slapfight, I will say that the paper focuses on the individual level, while the HPMOR quote focuses on nations in the aggregate. I consider this an important distinction to draw because the paper focuses on the individual guilt of citizens and not the policy-makers with actual powers to intervene, while the HPMOR usage of the term is of course referring to the policy level.

*************** Frankly, it depends on whether you think a study that suggests that the Bystander Effect isn't real at all counts as a study that proves that the usage in HPMOR is incorrect. That is to say, if the bystander effect isn't real at all, then it's by definition not scientific and only has literary, artistic, and allusive merit.

[[https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2019-30180-001.html]]

It's good as a metaphor, but not science, and not good as a didactic tool because it quite literally might not be true.

Do me a favor. Do you actually care about whether the use of the Bystander Effect in HPMOR is correct, or are we both so deep into this that neither of us wants to be proven wrong? Most of your points are perfectly valid, but we're approaching the work from fundamentally different critical perspectives. Frankly at this point my stance on HPMOR is the same as it's been for the past few years. It's a fun read, it drags a lot in the middle, most of the science is buzzwords being thrown around, and for those reasons it should be treated more like a mediocre popcorn flick than a fun educational read. The reality is, if I step back and take a breath, I'm not all that invested in whether the bystander effect is true or not because that fact will have a marginal impact on my perception of HPMOR.

I appreciate you taking the time to engage with me.

*********** to be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand HPMOR. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical reader's head. There's also Harry's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike HPMOR truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Harry's existential catchphrase "World domination is such an ugly phrase. I prefer to call it world optimization," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Eliezer Yudkowsky's genius wit unfolds itself on their Computer Monitors. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a HPMOR tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kids 😎
