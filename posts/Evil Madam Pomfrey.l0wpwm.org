Just to be complete ... Madam Pomfrey is probably the last person who didn't have her evil variant.


** There are some fanfics where Pomfrey is in cahoots with Dumbledore, not letting the abuse Harry suffers to be discovered.

Apart from that, this oneshot features ruthless!Pomfrey

*** Yes, I forgot all those Negligent-Pomfreys, right.

However, the one in the Assassin Wore White is not dark, she is a bad-ass Oath Enforcer, that's something different.

I meant, the true Dark Lady Pomfrey (in white, if you have to).

**** Check top comment. Not a dark Pomfrey fic but close enough.
