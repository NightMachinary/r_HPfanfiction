Finally reading through linkffn(The Many Deaths of Harry Potter) (dunno why it took me so long, it's awesome) and I just got to the scene where Lupin is doing the boggart class with the third years. Taken directly from the text:

#+begin_quote
  "Is there any way we can do this privately?" Malfoy asked. "The boggart is much more dangerous if you are alone," Professor Lupin said. "When there are more than one source of fear, the creature becomes confused, and it doesn't know what to turn into."
#+end_quote

Is this just ShayneT's genius at work or is this a thing in other fics/in canon? It's a great explanation for why Lupin did the Boggart lesson in front of everyone, as well as why the boggart in Grimmauld affected Molly so badly.


** Um, this follows canon exactly.

From Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban:

‘This means,' said Professor Lupin, choosing to ignore Neville's small splutter of terror, ‘that we have a huge advantage over the Boggart before we begin. Have you spotted it, Harry?'

Trying to answer a question with Hermione next to him, bobbing up and down on the balls of her feet with her hand in the air, was very off-putting, but Harry had a go.

‘Er -- because there are so many of us, it won't know what shape it should be?'

‘Precisely,' said Professor Lupin, and Hermione put her hand down looking a little disappointed. ‘It's always best to have company when you're dealing with a Boggart. He becomes confused. Which should he become, a headless corpse or a flesh-eating slug? I once saw a Boggart make that very mistake -- tried to frighten two people at once and turned himself into half a slug. Not remotely frightening.

*** Confusion, yes, but the part that caught me was "less dangerous." The implication there is that the effect of the boggart on you is dependent on how alone you are. This pairs well with how fear works in real life.

**** Well, the implication is exactly that it's "less dangerous" because it's confused. It can't frighten more than one person; hence better to face it as a group.

The author just re-worded canon.

***** Ah, I see your point. Guess I was reading too much into it. Shame, it's a nice idea that would have explained away a common issue people seem to have with canon (Lupin's decision to do the boggart challenge in public)

** Are we ever given any indication that boggarts are dangerous at all? Other than giving their victims a fright, do they do anything? I don't have a copy of the Hogwarts Library Fantastic Beasts booklet handy, but I don't think they actually pose any sort of risk. They don't actually become the things you fear, they just take on the appearance IIRC.

*** It's not entirely clear. They're covered fairly early on in schooling: 3rd year DADA, but that's the same time period as grindylows, kappas, etc, which can apparently kill untrained wizards and small children. We never see them physically affect a person in canon (though you could argue that they might be able to kill someone through sheer fright or manipulate them into a harmful situation via terror if left unchecked).

[[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/boggart][This Pottermore article]] does suggest that there are boggarts that have killed muggles though, which would imply that if left unchecked they can harm you.

**** How can wizards even tell if a Boggart did the damage? After all, Boggarts shape-shift. That would mean that every kill a Boggart commits can't be tracked back to it and if it escapes the scene, then it'd be easy to blame a murder on a rogue acromantula than an acromantula Boggart especially if you don't know what the victim's biggest fear is

** This is something I've always not liked about Lupin, and Harry Potter. This class, where you have to confront a physical representation of your worst fear, in front of like 30 other students. Your housemates, your friends, yes, but it's still all of them. I know it's a kid series, but kids still have fucked up things happen to them, and if it was a more realistic series...well, as one of those kids myself, I would have walked out of that class and stayed in the dormitory the whole time. That lesson, that class, would be insulting, and terrifying, and inappropriate to the extreme, and even RETRAUMATIZING.

I can imagine thirteen year old me, who was STILL BEING ABUSED at that time, getting to go to this cool magic school and be safe and happy for once, and then it's having to face my abuser in that safe place, totally out of the blue on a random class day, and having to do it in front of every other kid I knew. And a teacher. I wouldn't have liked it, to say the least.

I don't know if boggarts actually do hurt and kill their targets if they get the chance when they're alone with you (like boogeymen or whatever do), but I think that would make boggarts my worst magical creature fear in that world. The chance that you can randomly just COME ACROSS THEM in that world is terrifying even more. If me, now, as a twenty two year old woman, found a boggart who took the form of my mother, I'd fall apart all over again.

*** Eh. I mean, yes. But the entire point of the class is forcing you to LAUGH at your fears, and you also get to see over 20 other kids do the same thing.

So by the end of the day, not only will you have magically forced your fear into something funny, but you will have seen that dozens of other kids have fears just like you.

Pretty empowering one-two punch

**** Real life psychology doesn't work like that. You couldn't do that and that isn't empowering. It's useless. One little laugh at your trauma does nothing for you. Not the next time, or after that. If it was really anyone's deepest fears, no one would be able to laugh at it. They'd be terrified, and retraumatized, and they'd get worse. That's how real life works.

***** That's incredibly melodramatic. Everyone has a worst fear as a child, and most of us get over it in some fashion. And that's without the catharsis of a literal magic spell that can beat up your fear.

I had completely forgot that part and so was genuinely wondering if it was a representation of one of his deaths or the cause of his deaths (I'm glad to be wrong).
