Like, fics that have different prophecies that feel like /prophecies/ and not halfhearted riddles and poems.Give me what you've got!


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12588166/1/][The Other Evans Girl]] A jaded Hermione who's lost everything uses a dark ritual to erase her identity and become the twin sister of Lily Evans. She thinks that by using her knowledge of the past she can change the future, but her very presence has changed everything. I like that the new prophecy has unintended consequences as Voldemort desperately tries to stop it

** I've had a lot of fun rewording and reinterpreting the existing prophecy, but my own was more ham-handed.
