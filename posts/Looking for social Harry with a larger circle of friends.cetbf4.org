Particularly interested in fics where Harry is better friends with all the guys in his dorm.

Just finished re-reading Rogues Bet and this was the inspiration for this post.

Happy to read fics in any shape or size if anyone can help me out please.


** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10812901/1/Resolution]]) I read this one an incredibly long time ago so I don't remember a lot, but IIRC Harry decides to branch out and make new friends, (although not specifically the boys in his dorms, sorry)

  One does not walk from a near death experience unchanged. It's no wonder, then, when after two action packed years, it's a very different Harry Potter who arrives for his third year at Hogwarts School. new classes, new friends and a very new outlook on life, the Boy Who Lived was always meant for greatness. PoA AU. OOC. Rewrite in progress.
