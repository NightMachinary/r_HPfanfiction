:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
There was a fic I read a while back, the only thing I can really remember is that there was someone who was either planning on or did come up with a potion that could be added to the water supply that had the effect of making muggles automatically do whatever any magical told them to do, similar to the imperius, except that they behaved normally otherwise.

I can't remember whether it was only planned or was actually released, and I can't remember whether it was presented as a good thing or a bad thing from the PoV of the protagonist.

  Newt/Harry, Timetravel Shenanigans, Canon Divergent. His plan was to avoid changing the timeline. He knew he wouldn't be able to resist if the opportunity presented itself. So he fled to Africa, where opportunity found him instead.
