** Do you mean specifically married (bit unrealistic given the time period, unless Wizarding Britain has different marriage laws) or more general domestic life?

**** Then I recommend [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/58157][The Stealing Harry series]] an unfortunately unfinished AU but which includes rather a lot of Sirius and Remus being domestic together. The point of divergence is that Sirius never goes after Pettigrew, so he's a free man after the war and he and Lupin own a bookshop together.

** They're not exactly married in this one but it's very domestic (and it's a series, not a single fic but they flow into each other well): [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/610084][Basingstoke Diaries]]
