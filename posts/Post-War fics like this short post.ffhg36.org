I recently saw [[https://apaladinagain.tumblr.com/post/71312134939/harry-disappears-from-the-wizarding-world-for-a][this post]] describing Harry taking a break in the form of a trip to America, post war. I really liked the idea of a kind of slice-of-life, roadtrip, post-war fic about harry slowly getting to grips with life after the war.

If anyone has any recommendations that fit any of those themes (even just a good roadtrip, slice-of-life, quite calm fic) please let me know!
