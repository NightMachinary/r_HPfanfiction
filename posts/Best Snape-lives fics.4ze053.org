Hey all,

Requesting your best Snape doesn't die fics, as in Snape lives at the end of the Deathly Hallows.

Thanks!


** linkffn(Chasing the Sun by Loten) is one of the only Snape fics I've ever really liked, and it's very high quality. It's a Hermione/Snape pairing which I'd normally find odd, but it's well written.

Edit: err had to clarify on the author, bot picked up the wrong fic. Awkward lol

**** Well I didn't exactly pick the "wrong" one. OP didn't really 100% specify that the fic be canon compliant, just that Snape lives. PTL is good as well, I just preferred Chasing the Sun and that is why I suggested it.

***** I agree. Of the two of them I prefer Chasing the Sun as well.

Post Tenebras, Lux is a sweet sort of tale well told, but not terribly much happens by the way of action/plot.

  "After Darkness, Light." A chance meeting ten years after the war may not be just a coincidence, and may prove to have very far-reaching consequences. A story of many things, but primarily of healing. SS/HG; rated M for later chapters. Complete.

  This story is AU. What would have happened if Voldemort had understood that defeat, not death, conferred mastery of the Elder Wand and did not kill Snape? And what of all the stray Death Eaters that JKR forgot to mention? Like Bella Lestrange's husband?

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.
