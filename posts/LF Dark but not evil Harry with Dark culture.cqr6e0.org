What the title says. I'm looking for more fics like “Out of the Night” and “Evitative” by Vichan. Basically, fics where being a dark wizard doesn't necessarily mean a person is evil, there is a “dark culture” (preferably involving rituals), and Harry is a dark, but not evil, wizard. Thank you for your help!

~Auden


** A good number of Ellory's fics are like that, she likes to play around a lot with characters and paradigms like dark magic and pureblood culture, sometimes her Voldemort is a fair ruler, sometimes her Sirius and James are blood purists, etc.

Her work can be quite dramatic and even eye-rolling to be frank, but I think they're interesting reads and provide very unique prompts for possible novel length stories.

In Linkffn(11576185) dark magic is portrayed as natural and beautiful, for instance.

** The Reclamation of Black Magic linkffn(12058516)

Consider this. It's not Harry, but rather the women in Harry's life, headed by his grandmother. Darkish, but not evil. Uses ritual magic.

** I'm... not sure if it truly counts as it's really more humorous than truly dark, but it does fit the "dark but not evil Harry" theme perfectly, if maybe a little unconventionally (though it hasn't been updated in forever so probably abandoned, but first chapter is kind of a plot summary anyway), but... yeah.

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.

** Ah, I remember reading one where there was 'inborn magic alignment', meaning, that muggleborns are naturally neutral, any magics about sacrificing something is dark (and so was transfiguration as the author explained that turning, say, rabbit into dog means sacrificing the rabbit), and charms being light... So basically Harry wa 'dark-neutral' because James (who was good at transfiguration) was dark and his mother was neutral because of being muggleborn.\\
Pretty sure it was a Ravenclaw!Harry fic.

If that would even count for you.

I don't remember the name of the fic, anyway.
