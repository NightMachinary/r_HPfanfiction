I'm on a bit of a BSG kick at the moment and was wondering if there were actually any out there besides one (I can't remember what it's about exactly other than Harry/Hermione finding themselves on another OC Battlestar), so any help finding any crossovers would be great. Either when Harry or one of the main characters lands in the BSG 'verse or a Fic where the BSG crew find themselves in Hogwarts either as teenagers or not. Any help would be awesome.

Thanks!

** OMG- wow. I know the best BSG and Star Trek Cross Over. (I'm a leet-le drunk).

If you are interested, I'll try to find it. It stars Felix Gaeta, who got lost from Star Fleet.
