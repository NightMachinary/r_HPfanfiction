*** Agree 100%

Honestly, HPMoR is like if someone studied all of the people featured on [[/r/iamverysmart][r/iamverysmart]] and wrote a fanfic for them.

The fic, and the people that like it, just seem so ridiculously full of themselves.

I swear, almost every time someone says they don't like it because of how much of a boring slog it is, there's a crowd of people saying it's because you just haven't given it enough of a chance, or that you just don't understand the sublime intellectualism within.

....holy shit, I think I've got it. HPMoR is the Rick and Morty of the HP fandom, except with 80% less humor.

I legit had someone tell me - completely unironically - that they live their life based on what they learned from HPMoR.

And here I thought that the people relying on, say, Jordan Peterson were pathetic (you really need a psuedo-intellectual Canadian to tell you to clean your room?), but this is on a completely different level.

** Strongly disagree. I'm willing to be the author didn't even read most of those fics.

Also, the vast majority of those fics are basic sappy romance stories, nothing unique about them. I'd rather see a top 50 list that includes stories that aren't wholly based around a romance, that as well as crossover stories. Yes, they are important too!

** I'd only heard of a few, but my taste in fics isn't what most people on this list agree with.

I will agree that Odd Ideas is an excellent read, so long as you don't expect any of them to be finished. Rorscharch's Blot was out in the midwest or further north and west fighting fires, or something similar (there was a joke over on caerazkaban that he was doing unmentionable things to lady bears) and too tired to write last I heard, so sadly we have barely seen anything from him in the past couple years. Pity.

  [HPMOR] is by far the most famous fan fiction out there. Also possibly the only one with [[http://www.hpmor.com/][its own website]]. Rated T.

Based on the length of their [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Immortal_(fan_fiction)][wiki]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Methods_of_Rationality][pages]], not the most famous. My Immortal also has [[https://myimmortalrehost.webs.com/chapters122.htm][its own website]].

Looks more like first fifty fanfics the list's author read tbh. Half of those fics are the kind you like when you first start reading fanfiction, but then can't stand when you reread them.

Arguably, so do Harry Crow and Blindness, just because of their popularity. Same as MoR, as much as I loathe that fic.

But the rest... yeah, sounds like a list the author took from their own favorite stories.

** Ugh HPMOR. I only got through a couple of chapters of that one, it was so pretentious. The whole premise of “Petunia isn't abusive because she married someone else” annoys me anyway.

The only one I read and liked on that list was Living With Danger, and it's not even in the right category. Harry and Ginny are 11 and 10 respectively at the end of that fic, and they are still just friends with Ginny having a little crush on Harry. The main ships are Remus/FOC and Sirius/FOC. It isn't “Hinny” for another 3 sequels, and even then Ron/Hermione, Draco/Luna, and Neville/FOC get just as much screen time.
