So, i've finished my first Harry Potter fanfic ever and i decided to come and share it with you guys. If possible, it would be great if you could tell me your impressions on it. It's my first so i'm probably still a bit rough around the edges, so feel free to criticize it if you see fit.

** It has potential, but I can definitely tell this is your first work.

For the technical portion, there are a few grammatical errors, inconsistent capitalization of first-person 'I's, that sort of thing. Things that a beta-reader can fix up easily enough.

For the actual storytelling? You have a very strong tendency to tell, not show. This is usual for newer writers, so don't worry about it too much. Examples of what I mean by telling, not showing, are things like these:

- 'Jordan was a very skilled duelist, and that knockback jinx was his specialty.'\\
- 'Jordan had feelings for Sam, and he [had] had them for the longest time.'

The narrator is spelling it out to the reader, which makes everything rather bland and impersonal. You could replace the above quotes with something like this...

/In one moment, his hand was a fist; in the next, his wand was in his fingers, the motions of the spell half-complete, and by the time Schwann realized anything, a bolt of red light was streaking towards him. Schwann's hand searched for his own wand, but he was too slow/.

I know, it's not the best paragraph. But what does the above /show/, rather than tell?\\
- Jordan has very good reflexes\\
- Jordan is casting silently\\
- Therefore, Jordan probably has a lot of experience or skill under his belt.

Trying to /show/ affection rather than telling it is a whole lot more difficult, unfortunately. This is the kind of stuff that can get dragged out for paragraphs... but you get the general idea.

I think for the same reason (telling not showing), your story feels really fast-paced. Only 4,000 words for Jordan to go from good-natured to evil? People never change that quickly, for better or worse. If you can increase the word count, it would feel longer to the reader, which makes Jordan's shift in tone more subtle and more gradual.

Finally, consider your plot points. Why did Professor Leblanc need a human taste tester in the first place? Why didn't Sam report Professor Leblanc? We know that Sam has a good relationship with Professor Longbottom, so I assume that Sam would be able to trust them to do right by her. Why didn't /Jordan/ report Professor Leblanc, instead of escalating?

#+begin_quote
  [One Shot] Jordan Ruthfey, a sixth year student at Hogwarts is troubled by the nasty reputation his house of Slytherin had gotten after the defeat of Voldemort. With his plus all the other houses treating him as an outcast, him falling for a muggleborn girl and a scummy professor being on the loose, it'll be up for Jordan to choose to reject or embrace Slytherin's legacy.

** Congrats! I'm also new, so take what I say with a grain of salt. Your lack of show is hurting you specifically in building tension.

First, you start telling us about Slytherin, lost opportunity to hook us with his wolf-like appearance.

Then, the Professor we're supposed to hate starts as a background guy, and you show us little. He just kind of exists as a background Professor, and there's no reaction. You could have made him any other Professor and it wouldn't changed anything. When you introduced him, that was the time to show us, make us curious. What's going on with Sam and this Professor?

And with romance, again, lost opportunity to build tension. Does Sam like him back? Is he shy? How much are they hiding their feelings? We don't ask these questions because Sam is a blank on those questions until she kisses the MC. And the MC just likes her as far as I remember. It's okay to surprise us with Sam's feelings, but we should be surprised in the same way your MC is surprised.

I only read through twice and am relying on memory, hopefully it's accurate. Good luck!
