I was reading a fic a few days ago that mentioned a character reading a novel of fiction about a curse breaker in the victorian era (or something to the effect!) and it got me thinking - what would fiction novels look like?

Do wizards have a huge range of fiction about wizards to choose from? Do they read muggle stories? Are there hugely popular authors akin to Charles Dickens etc? Any thoughts? Or any fanfics about this kind of thing?


** This idea amuses me, so I'm going to write a list of "Wizard Crime Novel Cliches":

*The killer is an unregistered animagus

*Being framed via polyjuice

*Wizard PI solving crimes in the Muggle world

*Somehow interfering with owl post to prevent that last piece of info from getting to the detective

*Femme fatales seducing via love potion

*Sherlock Holmes except he's a Legilimens

** Well there's Lockhart lol.

I doubt they would read muggle fiction. We do know there are children stories about Harry Potter(Unless i'm contaminated by fanon), so there are probably other kind of fictions too. Also in the magical world, real stuff that happens is pretty interesting too.

*** I liked the idea in linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology), where wizards rewrite muggle novels to have wizarding elements in them.

** There's no english classes, no writing classes, no music classes or any other higher arts in sight. Also the Wizarding World appears culturally stagnant. How would anyone write a decent novel or a play - except maybe a Muggleborn?

I firmly believe that anything they have (Weird Sisters, Celestina Warbeck) pales in comparison to Muggle artists and is only notable and popular because they are a novelty ("Wow, a Wizarding Band, how unique").

*** I never thought of that! Very true. They could write I suppose but it certainly wouldn't be good by our standards - I totally agree!

*** I mean, just because some of their culture is stagnant doesn't mean that people aren't going to be driven to create art, nor does it mean there is a lack of demand for art. Sure, the population is smaller so they may not get a "Mozart" or a "da Vinci", but people live longer, so perhaps more of their craft will be refined. We know that Flitwick runs a choir, so at least some people have an interest. We also know that there are magical paintings, and at least in modern times, people like paintings that actually look like their parents, especially if they're going to talk to them, so there's been at least some development there.

That was made up for the movies. It's just as canon as Hermione wearing a pink dress or her and Harry dancing in the tent.

*** Without any kind of language-centred education past age 11? There are no magical classes which deal with grammar or style, all the teenagers learn are reports and semi /scientific/ writing and anything they would produce would be atrocious to read and the only time any fiction is mentioned are Harry Potter stories.

If you want to see the writing quality of such writers, go to Scryer and sort by favourites ascending with a 100k words minimum and canon pairings.

**** Thanks for the advice, will try his fic. But I still think that they do have a way to learn how to write. I mean even though Rita is a bitch, wizards still have newspaper and journalists/reporters .

** We know little about fiction in the wizarding world, but we do have some canon stuff. First, comic books, with Martin Miggs, the Mad Muggle: [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Martin_Miggs%2C_the_Mad_Muggle]] The issue shown is from the 1990s. But graphically, it does have a more retro feeling about it... About novels, I found one: "Cassandra and Her Cat Gustavus" [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Cassandra_and_Her_Cat_Gustavus]] We don't know much about it apart that it was at least sold in Wizarding America in the 1920s. But yeah, apart from that... Of course, we also have the tales of Beedle the Bard. But since at least one of them was based on true facts (the three brothers, of course), it's hard to define it completely in fiction. More like folklore, really...

It's not any theory about the subject but just some canon elements to help the reflexion. As for speculation, I would agree that fiction does not seem to be a big thing for wizards. Maybe because of lack of english class (but then, books in general are quite important, so I don"t know), maybe because creativity doesn't need writing to express itself: magic is enough. And creative writers seems to take on journalism easily enough, anyways...
