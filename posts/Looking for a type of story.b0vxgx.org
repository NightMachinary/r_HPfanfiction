Looking for story's where harry is in jail or something for hundreds of years and it changes from the wizarding world to a different fandom


** It's not /jail/ but Browncoat Green Eyes does feature a Harry who is indisposed for centuries and wakes up in a crossover.

** Not a perfect fit, but you may like linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar by Steelbadger)

Harry's actually summoned, but he's summoned right into the Witch-king's prison. He's there a bit before the story starts. Obviously, when he gets out he's in Middle-Earth.

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.
