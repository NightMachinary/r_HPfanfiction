** Good find.

I've used FanFictionDownloader so far: [[http://fanfictiondownloader.net/index.php]]

Calibre is great for conversion between formats: [[http://calibre-ebook.com/]]

** The other day, I heard a rumor that one of my favorite fanfic authors might quit the game. I started to get worried she'd go so far as to delete her fanfic from fanfiction.net, so I began to ask around for the best way to save fics. Someone pointed me toward [[http://www.flagfic.com/][flagfic]], and I have to say, it's working really well so far. It supports many major fanfiction sites, and will convert stories into PDF or into Nook and Kindle-friendly formats. I thought the denizens of [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] could make good use of it.

*** Super late reply, I know... But may I ask who this favorite author is?

** This is great. It's a shame they don't cover more fanfic sites. Off to request!

** Wish I knew about this a long time ago! I've been doing the ol' copy and paste to a document and convert to .mobi format for my Kindle.

Thanks for bringing to my attention :) It's so much nicer having a great fanfic at hand to read wherever you want.
