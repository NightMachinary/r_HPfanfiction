What characters do you consider neutral? I've always considered the Sorting Hat true neutral due to his role in the story. He only sorts a person based on where they should go. He does not care if you're evil or not - just whether you belong in Gryffindor. I think of the Goblins as... chaotic neutral. They do not care if you are the bane of the wizarding world - as long as you don't interfere with business then they don't care. House Elves aren't neutral either really. They serve their current master in any way - be it murdering an innocent or making some tea - and they'll do it with a smile on their face.


** Due to the nature of the war, there /can't/ be a neutral wizarding side native to England. Its a blood war, and the way the war is split, you are forcibly slotted into a side. The only /neutral/ wizarding side would be purebloods who became valuable to both sides through their services (potions etc.).

** The Hat strikes me as Lawful Good. It must Sort fairly, and that overrides any good intentions it might have, but when it gets to talk, it generally preaches unity in the face of evil and such.
