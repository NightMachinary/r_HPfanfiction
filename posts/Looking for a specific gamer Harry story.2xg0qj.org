So, I read this story where Harry is a gamer, in a guild (party?) with Tom Riddle and Severus Snape. His Dad and Sirius also play the video game as warriors, but Harry keeps his identity secret from them. He also has crazy luck in game for some reason.

I can't remember the title, or anything specific enough to try to google it, so I figured I asked. Anyone recognize it?

I don't even remember why I stopped reading it, and I might pick it back up only to remember why I stopped reading it, but it's really, really bugging me. Also, it's more likely to be on AO3 then FF.net because their formatting's nicer and they crash less- though this isn't for sure.

Edit: +found it!+ +It was a similar but different story. Guess I'm still looking, sorry.+ Actually found it this time :). It's called The Game. Here's a link if anyone's curious [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8366987/1/The-Game]]


** Is it slash because I might know which one you mean.

EDIT: found the one I had in mind [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1883784/chapters/4058439][Equilibrium]]. Is this it?

I just read the four chapters of Equilibrium and aside from Hagrid and Sirius appearing as NPCs, I don't see anything about James or Severus. Where did you get that from?

***** Oh! You're right, it's a different story- I thought it was the right one because it was similar and I'd read it too. Actually, I found it while I was searching for this story ^{^{'}}

****** Well now I've got a thread up looking for stories similar to Equilibrium. Maybe the one you're specifically looking for will pop up there.

**** So apparently the writer for Equilibrium wrote another gamer based story called The Game which is linked below. I got the question wrong yet right at the same time. :)
