Hi all,

I am planning to print the Alexandra Quick stories into book format but wanted to create my own book covers. Thought I'd share them with you all incase you also wanted to use them for any point.

​

Preview them here: [[https://imgur.com/a/t9j1B8n]]

** These are really nice, though I think they should at least have the author's name on them somewhere.

*** The final versions will do, before I get them printed. But I wanted the Authors blessing before putting their name to the covers.

**** I messaged them about a WIP of mine about a female witch going through her 7 years in the US, making sure they were OK with me writing it and any accidental similarities that may occur, and they responded really fast. They're probably still active on there, just not currently publishing anything.

** They're good and simplistic. I do have a question though: For "Alexandra Quick and the Stars Above," is the first horizontal line purposefully red? Should it be green instead?

** Awesome covers! Love the simplistic style.

If I may ask, what method are you going to use to print the books? A few years ago when I read the Alexandra Quick series a friend showed interest in them, but did not want to read them digitally. I would love to get physical copies for that purpose.

*** I usually use Lulu. Prices aren't too bad on there but the Cover designer can be absolutely pants. There isn't an option to have a graphic on the spine of the cover (hence why I haven't done anything on the spine here)
