** Excellent. Of course, I seem to recall the plot took a sharp right hand turn just before the last update, so it might be best for readers to go back a ways when coming back to it.

*** There were so many lines I had to check in previous chapters. After you've read so many pics with tinks in its hard to remember which personality they actually have.

** I don't even remember what happens in this fic. Except some weird shit with Fleur that didn't make sense.

** Didn't read after chapter 20 or so, but the first few chapters were very promising. Might sit down and read it completely if updates are coming again.

** This is an excellent news. Hope it's not just a chapter and then nothing for a year. The merging is easily one of the best wip out there at the moment.
