All the uses of the Fidelius charm in canon were on locations: Godric's Hollow, Grimmauld Place, and Shell Cottage. I'm looking for stories that apply it more creatively, like to abstract concepts.

The ones I know of:

- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin): "[[/spoiler][Tom Marvolo Riddle is the dark wizard known as Lord Voldemort.]]" With the Secret-Keeper being [[/spoiler][Tom Riddle's sentient diary]].
- linkffn(The Fine Art of Fine Print): "[[/spoiler][The Potions teacher of Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry is Severus Snape.]]" Also includes an original way of breaking the Fidelius by Hermione.
- linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches): Still location-based, but with added details like a conditional Fidelius and another way of breaking them.


** Found another one: /Honestly, Harry/. linkffn(9901496). Comedic overpowered Fidelius abuse.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

Ah, it's 'Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation' (linkffn(5537755)).

"You cannot speak, you must keep faith" are words associated with the Fidelius throughout the story. And there's a /lot/ more than sex going on in it.

  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.
