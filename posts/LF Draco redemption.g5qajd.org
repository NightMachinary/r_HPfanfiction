** I think it's pretty well known but "To be a Slytherin" is really good. It is one of my favorite fics Ever. It has Draco AND Slytherin house redemption, as well as less biased views of Dumbledore and Harry. (Not hating on then, but exposing their flaws). It is really well written, and spans 1st year to post war. Has a few changes to the books (medium amount of world building), but in a way that feels right.

This one definitely has redemption but not as early on, definitely made me cry so much. It's the Malfoy redemption that is realistic, (ie, not immediate and slow burn). My favorite thing about this fic is the length and the character development. Also, the author takes great care to balance out the ofc and make sure she has major flaws to counteract her abilities. I finished this about ten minutes ago and it is ~1500k words.

Ok so this one is recently completed, really long, and well written.

However it is a sequel. The first book is James potter/OFC and my favorite fic of that type.

You don't need to read it in order to read the draco/ofc but it does help to an extent. (And it is an AMAZING and long fic)

Then the draco /ofc is based on the ofc being the daughter of the ofc from the first book.

My all time favorite draco/ofc series is sadly, unresolved. However I have re read it more than any other fanfiction and I'm usually picky about WIPs. They are well worth the read cuz they are so well written with a really good subplot, AND they are slow burn / there is some frustration cuz stupid teenagers are stubborn. The author did recently say she's ready to update. This fanfiction is the best I have ever read.

They all have elements of Mary Sue, but not the "rawr xd I'm a half vampire half mermaid sorted into Slithering and griffendoror and I sing 1D songs with draco and harry in a battle for their affections" way, but in the "OC has got more power than a standard wizard but also some flaws to balance it out more"

I hope you enjoy :))

** I love Exile and Manacled. Exile is about Draco living in the muggle world - initially he's pretty unhappy about it. Massive trigger warnings for Manacled - it's a Handmaid's Tale crossover. Despite that, I found it consistently unusual and surprising, was refreshingly focussed on the politics of a resistance group, and is the only Hermione/Draco slash that's ever made sense to me. linkffn(6432055) linkao3(14454174)

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.
