*** To be fair though the point of becoming an animagus didn't really seem to be in the offensive or even defensive abilities of the animals (petty much null unless you decide to hand-wave the whole thing to hell and back with the magical animagus bullshit) but more in fleeing/passing unnoticed. It would be useful to lose DE hunting the person, potentially flying away from DE and be a true lifesaver from dementors and werewolves, if nothing more it seems more versatile than the patronus and as far as the process go from the article in Pottermore it seems to be more about having good timing rather than any actual skill or power or even theoretical knowledge, it would actually be potentially easier with more people to remind each other of the steps and share the work.
