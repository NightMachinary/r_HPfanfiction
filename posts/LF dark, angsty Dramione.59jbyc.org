Hey guys, I'm looking for recommendations for fics that are:

- dramione
- dark
- angsty
- romantic
- multi-chapter, the longer the better. No one shots please.
- well written

Fluff is okay, but I don't want a purely fluffy fic.

- no rape
- I love during the war, torture, post-war fics best, but I'd also like pre-war fics.
- don't care if it's marriage law or not

I've already read most of the extremely popular ones, the Bracelet, Isolation...

Thank you so much for your time.


** Personally, I like [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=1918][Seven Years and a Day]] and linkffn(Far Be it From Me by riptey).

It's hard to know what you have and haven't read of the popular ones, so I'll just throw a few popular fics in here. Sorry if this is repeating information you know. I've read all of these and none of them are personal favorites, but I can vouch that they're well-written, MC, and angsty. linkffn(Claiming Hermione by ilke), linkffn(After The Flood by hiddenhibernian), linkffn(A Little Piece of Sincerity by provocative envy), linkffn(The Dragon's Bride by Rizzle), [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=117][Lessons and Obsessions]], linkffn(What The Room Requires by Alydia Rackham), linkao3(A Pale and Pointed Mirror by Musyc).

You can of course click around those authors' other works. Other authors to try as well: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1084919/luckei1][luckei1]] is probably not as dark as you'd like, but her stuff is incredibly popular and formative in the ship as a whole. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2121043/camnz][camnz]] writes dark, angsty MC romance, but her writing is a little simplistic. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/634912/attica][attica]] is an "author's favorite" type: most of the d/hr authors I know like her stuff a lot. She took down her most famous fic (Basket Case) but the rest of her fics are still up. [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/ningloreth][ningloreth]] also writes a lot of dark dramione.

If you haven't guessed yet, dramione is actually kinda my life, so I'll wax poetic a little. I find reddit a little dead for dramione, and think you should try some of the other resources. You can crawl through recs at the D/Hr rec community [[http://dhr.accio.nu][DHr Accio]]. Lots of tumblr blogs have their own personal rec pages like [[http://tomriddle.tk/post/118374196178/dramione-fic-recs-a-comprehensive-list][this]] or [[http://youknowyoushipdramionewhen.tumblr.com/recommendations][this]] or [[http://bex-chan.tumblr.com/fanfictionsrecs][this]]. If you haven't tried all the stories at [[http://dramione.org/toplists.php?list=favstories][H&V's top lists]] you should give it a try. A lot of them are dark, MC, and angsty. And when you've exhausted all of that, you can also crawl through [[http://dramioneficindex.tumblr.com][dramione fic index]] and search on a theme that appeals to you. And if you want recs one at a time, you can always hit [[https://dramioneasks.tumblr.com][dramioneasks]].

Hope that helps!

** I really love Cruel and Beautiful World by lena phoria, but the author took it down unfortunately. You may still be able to find a version if you search for it.

I really like linkffn(Broken by inadaze22).

My favourite I think is linkao3(As Certain Dark Things Are To Be Loved by somuchcloser).

linkffn(The Die by colubrina) may also fit your requirements!

Also, linkffn(Aurelian by bittyblueeyes) is a little off your specific request but it does kind of fit.

  Dark Magic changes a person. What lines do you cross to kill Voldemort? What do you give up to save the world? And how do you live afterwards? Starts off VERY dark and gets lighter; some sex & torture. Hermione-centric story; slooowly develops into Dramione. The wait is worth it, though; promise. 1 yr post Battle of Hogwarts.

*** Good rec! In fact, I'd say most [[http://dramione.org/viewuser.php?uid=2][everythursday]] fics fit OP's request. A few highlights (judging from popularity on tumblr lol) are [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=367][Parade of the Sun]] and [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=1034][When the Bell Tolls]]. I've read Parade and The Fallout, and both of them are very long, angsty, and well-written. I'm not the biggest fan of her characterizations but most people would say that they're very IC, and a lot of people consider her Draco to die for.

**** I agree that her stuff is technically good writing and her characterizations are good. However, I didn't like the Fallout because it didnt feel like Harry Potter. The magic didn't feel like HP, the world didnt feel like HP (because it was largely the muggle world), and her way of numbering the days was disorienting. It pretty much just wasn't my taste, even though it is definitely an objectively good fic. Are her other things the same? Also, agree that her Draco is suuuuper hot.

***** Yah I gotcha---her Draco is super hot... and she writes sexual tension like no one else. I'm probably not the best person to ask because I was never quite sold on her stuff. (I like both her characterizations... but I don't especially like them together?? I feel like in her fics, Draco is often one step ahead of Hermione, and it just doesn't... fit with my head canon or w/e. The Fallout is probably the worst offender for this, though, and her other fics are a bit better.) If I were just starting out in the ship, I would probably love sage to death, but for some reason it took me a while to get to her stuff, and by then I was already old and set in my ways! lol.

But hmm. If you loved her characterizations, it might be worth it to crawl through her other stuff. She does a /lot/ of precise dating of scenes like she does in The Fallout, so watch for that. I think most of her other stuff is more HP-ish than The Fallout, especially Sugar Water, Finders, and When the Bell Tolls? So maybe start there... especially Finders since I think that doesn't have dated scenes.
