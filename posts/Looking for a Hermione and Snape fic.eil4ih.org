Okay, here is what I remember:

Harry died and the Death Eaters rule. Hermione is recruited by Luna to infiltrate Snape's house, but I can't remember her role. At one point he takes her to the opera. She goes to visit Remus and bring him food; he's ill and in a camp. the story ends with Hermione, Remus and others being rescued by, among others, Ron (I think).

It's a bit stream-of-consciousnesses thing, but I think I have the salient points. any help would be appreciate.
