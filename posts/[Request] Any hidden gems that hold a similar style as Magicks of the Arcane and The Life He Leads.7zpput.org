What I'm really searching for is a fic that contains an interesting Dumbledore and Harry relationship. In both of these fics there are rather striking interactions between the two characters, which really serve to make the story interesting and compelling. The side focus on au magic systems is really fascinating as well, avoiding the matter of magical cores and the like.

Don't expect for there to be many out there, but anything that vaguely fits into this criteria would be appreciated :) .


** Essential reading material if you liked Magicks of the Arcane: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358/1/What-You-Leave-Behind][What You Leave Behind]]. linkffn(10758358).

(PS: I feel like I'm recommending this fic everywhere these days.)

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

*** Ah sadly I've already read it, but thanks regardless. I feel like someone should keep a notebook of this sort of genre of story, it feels like there's only a few of them knocking about, which is a shame because I definitely find the style interesting.

I recall there was another fic that has a similar premise actually, it has a very creative approach to some forms of magic.
