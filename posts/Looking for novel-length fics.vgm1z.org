So I've read all of these, and loved them. And right now I am searching for more. They don't have to follow canon, can even be in the Marauders era. So, what do you suggest? List of what I read so far:

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Methods_of_Rationality][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]]

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7937889/21/A_Difference_in_the_Family_The_Snape_Chronicles][A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles]]

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4315906/25/Dumbledores_Army_and_the_Year_of_Darkness][Dumbledores Army and the Year of Darkness]]

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4384697/1/Sluagh][Sluagh]]

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4914208/1/A_Peccatis][A Peccatis]]

Thanks!


** What length are you looking for, exactly? I'd recommend [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A_Black_Comedy][A Black Comedy]] and [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The_Lie_Ive_Lived][The Lie I've Lived]] (the writing quality gets /much/ better after the first 2 or 3 chapters, it was originally a fic for a contest), they're in the 200k - 250k range. A Black Comedy is the best comedy fic I've read (Harry/Sirius bromantic comedy), while The Lie I've Lived features easily the best version of the Triwizard Tournament I've seen, as well as just being amazing overall.

** Well, not canon or Marauders either one, but I love everything by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1374917/Inverarity][Inverarity,]] and they are all novel-length. One is a young Teddy Lupin at Hogwarts fic, and the others follow the adventures of an original character named Alexandria Quick, a young American witch.

If you like slash, I enjoyed both The Apple Tree and Fate is a Four Letter word by [[http://www.hpfandom.net/eff/viewuser.php?uid=3962][Philo.]] Both are well-written, very long reads with complex plots.

- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=305303][Harry Potter and the Conspiracy of Blood]]

It's a WIP, although it's nearing completion. Author posts a new chapter roughly every 2 weeks.

** Here's the longest Harry Potter fanfic I've ever read: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7056390/1/][The New Skin]] by Mottsnave. It's the further adventures of Severus Snape, after he is rescued from the Shrieking Shack and smuggled away via Portkey by a friend (if anybody in Snape's life can be categorized as a friend). The writing style is sometimes a bit on the dry side, but I found the story to be intricately detailed and fascinating.

****** Hmm... As far as long fics go, I really enjoyed [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4315906/1/Dumbledores_Army_and_the_Year_of_Darkness][Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness]] (a Neville-centric fic) and [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5095119/1/The_Dragons_Bride][The Dragon's Bride]] (a Dramione fic). I'm just starting to build my fanfic .pdf collection via [[http://www.flagfic.com/][FlagFic]], and those are my favorites of the ones I've saved so far. There are several shorter, oneshot-ish type fics that I like, but when I want to read quality novel length work I re-read one of these three.

edit: Oh, ha! I just realized that you listed Dumbledore's Army... and Sluagh at the top! Love them both. (:

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving_Connor][Part 1: Saving Connor]]

It spans all 7 books and it's very intricate and detailed.
