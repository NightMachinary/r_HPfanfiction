I imagined that in an AU Tom is being a noble, kind and gentle man, who possible even gets famous. Maybe he is in a Relationship or is married. But at some Point he changes. I thought that after Voldemorts defeat in Canon somehow his Essence (no Horcrux) invades this Universe and finds his counterpart. However this corruption would process rather slowly instead of in a blink of an eye.

But i leave the possibility open that somehow a Horcrux get into the AU and infected Tom.

Im open for other possibilities, though
