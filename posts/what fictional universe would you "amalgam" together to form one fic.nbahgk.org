Okay so, for those of you unaware amalgam was a time DC and marvel teamed up to form a sort of "fused" universe, with composite characters such as Supersoldier (Superman and Captian america), darkclaw (batman and wolverine) and Hyena (joker and sabertooth).

but anyways the point if you were to "add" a universe into the mix, so to speak, Which universe would you chose, and, who would you merge the characters with, and what would be the premise.

okay so lets go hunger games.

main character Harkness Everdeen,(Katniss and harry female) is an orphan in Goodrich hollow, an 11th level residential district, that each year must put forth 11 students to the Hogwarts games, (a deadly tournament allowing entry into Hogwarts, Harkness is selected in secret, and brought to the games Training area and meets several characters there, combine say Ron, and Peeta. Hermoine and Rue? perhaps.

​

During a brief training session alliances form as there are always a limited number of slots, into Hogwarts, decided by the "games" a series of games where, after a brief introduction to magic, they fight in a brutal combat till there no longer too many people, they all then enter into Hogwarts.

from there we can have the plot be about the school learning magic, and continued at school yearly games, similar to the entry games, where deaths can happen, but its always "accidents" and never "intentional"

combine Voldemort with, honestly Snow, reveal that it was Snowdemort(better name needed mabey?) is the man who personally orphaned Harkness parents and setup the games and continued brutal combat for some dark nefarious purpose.

Other ideas here combine Snape with Plutarch,\\
Sirrius with Haymitch\\
Tonks could combo with Effie mabey?\\
Cinna could combo with Dumbledore

anyways any other universes and plots to mash together like that and, who from each would you merge, and so on and so forth


** I've always wanted more vampires in Harry Potter , so probably the vampire diaries and Harry Potter. I've always found the doppelgängers really interesting too so I could see them being cool in the HP universe.

** Mine would be the Diablo 3 universe and the Potterverse. It'd be an M rating with warnings for suicide and general terribleness that the demons in the Diablo universe would bring. The Wizard is the one that goes through everything and eventually, to deal with the fact that Nephilim are rising again, works with Tyreal to create a new worldstone. With some new, important features.

He is tied to it in the timeless space where Malthiel was trying to gather all the souls, essentially putting it outside the reach of anything living to avoid corruption like the original.

He uses the potential of the Nephilim that the worldstone locks away to push the Shining Heavens and the Burning Hells at the other ends of infinity, ending the Eternal Conflict.

Tyreal places El'druin as a gateway of sorts as a watch on it to ensure the worldstone and the Wizard use the power and position wisely and justly.

Sanctuary is moved into the Arcane Void - our universe and it basically becomes Earth in the distant past.

These changes have the unfortunate side effect of a cataclysm for the civilizations, knocking everyone back to stone-age levels.

None are left that remember anything about pre-worldstone existence by the time of Harry Potter. Magic the witches and wizards use is an echo of the power the Nephilim had that the Wizard lets into the world.

Now, the way I thing it plays out is that after Sirius dies, Harry finally has it with everything and decides he's done.

Asks his uncle for some rope to hang himself and Vernon, not really taking it seriously, tells him where it is in the garage. Harry wraps himself in the invisibility cloak and hangs himself. That's the plot device that makes him stop at the worldstone when his soul should have just passed through. Cue surprised Wizard meeting surprised Potter.

While those two meet and the Wizard explains things to Potter, Harry's death while covered with THE cloak knocks loose a most unfortunate gem - a shard of the original, corrupted worldstone that still has a sliver of B'aal's soul attached.

Voldemort, not knowing Harry is dead, gets wind of a powerful and dark gem causing problems in magical Egypt, investigates and finds the shard. After some time contemplating it back in England, decides not to use it as no matter what he does, the effect is just destruction of everything he attempts - after all, B'aal's soul doesn't like being told what to do.

There's other plot points, Harry gets to come back since he was only technically mostly dead and therefore a little alive still.

One scene I want to explore is Pettigrew getting a hold of the worldstone shard and falling under it's influence - ends up jamming it into his forehead and B'aal immediately takes over his body, but badly because he's not worn flesh is quite some time. Pettigrew-puppet scene will be pretty gruesome but a prime evil taking over a human body 'is not meant for mortal eyes'.

B'aal figures out some of what happened but mainly sees a world ripe for him to take over and goes about corrupting everything he can, things spiral out of control and spill out across the world as pseudo-demon invasion since the Wizard is still holding the Burning Hells and the Shining Heavens at opposite ends of infinity, Baal isn't able to call on his demon horde. BUT since humans are Nephilim without the extra boost they should get, he is able to twist and corrupt humans and other stuff into suitable replacements.

Harry and the Wizard speak and Harry finally decides to go back to the land of the living, finds things at the beginning of the invasion, months after he 'died', the whole world is falling apart, hundreds of millions dying and the magical world is forced to work with muggles to fight. Voldemort and Dumbledore are pushed to work together to keep everything from being hyper-murdered. Harry finds out that most of his year has died and the remaining are pretty close to just saying fuck it.

Harry's reunion with his friends is cut short when the pseudo-demons find him due to the 'scent' of the worldstone on his magic. Some, if not all of his friends are murdered in front of him in various, horrible ways before he's killed too.

Finds himself back at the worldstone and ends up accidentally grabbing El'druin. The sword, being an extension of the Archangel of Justice, weighs his soul and in the process, burns the Voldeshard from him. The Wizard finds out about the invasion and what happened to Harry. Gets pissed as all, literal, hell. Gives Harry the chance to go back with his full Nephilim potential since the Wizard bound himself to the worldstone.

Harry accepts and reenters Sanctuary with a Nephilim wizard's potential and a Demon Hunter's attitude.

That's book 1 of the Sanctuary Potterverse, leaves a lot of plot to be had, mixing of Muggles and Magicals. Lots of baddies to fight in a post-demon apocalypse with the old enemies of the Potterverse needing to work together so there's plot threads there to be explored. Ancient magic from the Diablo setting that Harry can access or mix with what the Magicals figured out.

Lots of directions for Harry in the second book. Harry could keep with the magical side of things and become another Wizard, he could go full Demon Hunter with guns and other stuff since the Magical and Muggle will need to have mixed to survive the demons. He could use his experience with death to go full Necromancer. Maybe he could take his experience with what happened when he touched El'druin to become a crusader - touching and being judged by something directly influenced by the Archangel of Justice could do a lot for him.

The only Diablo 3 classes I don't really feel Harry could fit into are the Witch Doctor, Barbarian or Monk. I can see some characters fitting into those sort of types, just without the Nephilim potential the worldstone locks away. Maybe Crabbe or Goyle end up as a barbarian type in the course of things since they're magical but more brute-strength. For some reason, I can see Luna as a witch doctor though I think it's more because I could see her creating totems out of things, some gruesome, as her way of dealing with the world she finds herself in. Or the twins because I could see them chanting while about to be overrun, tossing explosive frogs and locusts at things before - BOOM! Suddenly a flock of fetishes are running around, stabbing the shit out of everything. Can't think of a good Monk type though.

The third book - because of course it could be a trilogy - could be the world adjusting after whatever group formed, led by Harry (Him leading can be something he decided to accept, doesn't accept but just wants to kill demons, or something he does unknowingly in the course of just being himself) After that group finally kills the shard of B'aal and having pushed the demons back, either entirely or just into hazardous areas, they have to adjust to the post-war Earth. How much will be revealed, what will people do, did Voldemort and his merry band of fuckwits survive?

Ah, the possibilities....
