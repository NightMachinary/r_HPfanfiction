** I think it's wish fulfillment? Most harem fics are enjoyed by young straight men, and they like the idea of having a different girlfriend for each mood you're in. Or they like so many different characters, and they want to date them all, so Harry should. After all Harry's been though, he deserves his trophies, right? /s. I'm not against polyamory in any way, it's just how these fics are written most of the time

Which is quite a shame because some fics had a great premise before they became a harem. I think that the best example here is "Rune Stone Path". I love the world-building and the mentor/parent relationship Harry has with Shiva/Babbling in that fic, which honestly is second to none. Even the Harry/Hermione/Fleur/Tonks endgame could have been believable if it was handled as two couples joining forces for some fun and developing attachments along the way. Somewhat OOC, but there's always alcohol to justify bad decisions.

But the whole "pureblood culture" arc simply sucks because it takes all potential depth from the relationship dynamics. Rather than struggling with the whole thing, it turns into a collection for Harry.

*** After having read a lot of harem (90% of Wuxia and Xianxia novels seem to do it), I can tell you that in most case, the "intimacy of romantic entanglement" in harem is the MC thinking to himself "I love my wives, oh but new girl is beautiful, i will love her too", and the girls being plot device that loose all personality once their arc is over and they join the harem, just some pretty face that is "really" happy that he brought a new "sister".

*** You have officially inspired me to a new prompt! How would a harem with no 'romantic' entanglement come about? What would that look like?

Short answer: A Quidditch Team. And Oliver Wood really likes Quidditch. :D

Oliver utilises typical fanon weird-tantric-Kama-Sutra Magic to create the ultimate Quidditch team. He can affect their emotions (to make them more determined) and share his love (of the game) and they're all telepathic so he can call plays real easily. The older generations alternate between infuriated at their use of marital magics and scandalised by the very notion of that many people being involved.

** I honestly don't know. Personally, the word "harem" has always rubbed me the wrong way. It brings negative associations with islam and slavery. Not all women joined harems of their own free will:

[[http://www.allaboutturkey.com/harem.htm]]

#+begin_quote
  Young girls of extraordinary beauty were sent to the Sultan's court, often as gifts from the governors. Numerous harem women were Caucasians, Georgians, and Abkhazians. *They were usually bought from slave markets after being kidnapped or else sold* by impoverished parents.
#+end_quote

​

So basically Harry goes around kidnapping, imprisoning and raping women? (I know that's not what happens in most fics, but still.) No thanks. I really hate the word "harem" and I do not understand why people can't just use the proper term which is "polyamory/ polygamy".

​

Ranting aside, I've never really enjoyed "harem" stories. Most of them are badly written wish-fulfillment or just smut. And too unrealistic. I know it's silly to talk of "realism" when there's magic, but still. I can maybe buy Harry being with two girls, but more? There is no way everyone will just get along all the time. There is going to be serious friction and even rows and fights. That being said, the one "harem" story I /did/ enjoy was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11898648/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Rune-Stone-Path][The Rune Stone Path]] because it has a plot and was not created for the sole purpose of getting Harry in bed with several women at once.

*** People don't use the term polyamory because there isn't amory involved. In the vast majority of these fics the female characters are essentially mannequins wearing different wigs who center their lives around god!Harry. Its all kinds of gross.

*** Whilst Islam had a large role in Harems I don't think that's why they occured. It's more just a powerful man who likes to fuck around just making the women 'officially his'. I don't particularly enjoy the idea of Harems either though because it is as you said VERY easy to turn it rapey.

**** Well, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harem][wikipedia]] says that:

#+begin_quote
  The idea of the harem or seclusion of women did not originate with Muhammad or Islam. The practice of secluding women was common to many Ancient Near East communities, especially where polygamy was permitted

However we studied quite a bit about the Ottoman empire in school so I've always associated harems with islam and slavery.

***** *Harem*

Harem (Arabic: حريم‎ ḥarīm, "a sacred inviolable place; harem; female members of the family"), properly refers to domestic spaces that are reserved for the women of the house in a Muslim family. This private space has been traditionally understood as serving the purposes of maintaining the modesty, privilege, and protection of women. A harem may house a man's wife --- or wives and concubines, as in royal harems of the past --- their pre-pubescent male children, unmarried daughters, female domestic workers, and other unmarried female relatives. In former times some harems were guarded by eunuchs who were allowed inside.

** Generally, as most people have said, it's wish fulfillment. But I think it's a bit more than just that. Fanfiction is, at its root pretty much all about wish fulfillment. I wish this character this that, I with the author had explored this theme, I wish I was the person in this story because I'd be so much smarter. Wish fullfillment is pretty much fanfiction in a nutshell.

So what specifically causes the harem thing? I think it's actually a kind of impatience. Some people have their One True Pairing, and will only read stories that feature it, or at least do not feature its competitors. Other people like a variety of pairings, for a variety of reasons (interesting social situations, colliding world views, characters X, Y and Z are just so totally hot).

Theres this psychological thing called decision fatigue, where people given more choice make poorer quality decisions. They have too many options to assess the merits of each, so they basically just make their choice at random.

I think writers often write harem because they don't want to have to choose between a bunch of different possible pairings. It's a lot of work to write a whole story, it would just be so much easier to squeeze four relationships into this one story than write four whole stories. This is pretty much always a bad idea. It cramps any romantic beats and cuts all the romance off at the ankles. The story would have been so much better served if the writer had just chosen one, and stuck to them.

But that choice is hard, and it's a real investment to write too. The temptation is real. I suspect some people enjoy reading it for similar reasons. Why scratch only one itch when you can scratch them all?

But also, it makes ma peepee hard.
