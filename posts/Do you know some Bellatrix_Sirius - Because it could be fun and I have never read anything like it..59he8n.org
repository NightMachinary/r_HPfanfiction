Yes. Bellatrix and Sirius.

I had this idea in my head since I commented on a thread not too long ago. The Black family is, obviously, not afraid of interbreeding and also not afraid to pressure their kids into what they think is the best.

So, what if Sirius marrying Bellatrix and having the most disfunctional marriage ever would be a thing?

I want to read this. I want to read this so bad, if it isn't out there I'll get it out there myself.

Bonus points for them raising Harry.

Recommend me the clusterfucks, please.

edit: I found two stories by one author myself. They're really nice reads. One-shots.

As the recommendations were sparse, I did as I said: I wrote my own. At least I began to.

** Not sure if I could stomach a marriage fic with the two of them, but I'd read the shit out of one where there's a weird sexual energy between them. ETA: You've just sent me down the dark rabbit hole of cousincest. I just discovered I'm now a Albus/Rose shipper haha. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11993963/1/What-We-Have-Instead-of-God]])

*** D'awww that was sweet, if incestuous.

Yes, I'm right there with you in that rabbithole. Its rare that I make a request without then looking for them myself. There is some weird shit out there.

** Just curious, but does canon ever explain exactly how closely related they are? Fandom is full of "purebloods are all inbred!" comments, but I don't recall an example of extreme inbreeding. Genetically, your 5th cousin is not related enough to actually matter, and then it becomes more of a social issue. Do the books give any examples of first or second cousins marrying?

**** I thought so. I remember Sirius showing Harry the tapestry and mentioning that all the pureblood families are vaguely related, and maybe a mention that Sirius and the Potters were distantly related by Harry's grandmother or something.

I suppose it's one of those instances where the fandom got hold of a trope and blew it out of proportion.

*** They're cousins over Walburga Black (nee Black), who married Orion Black and birthed Sirius and Regulus. Walburga was a sister to Cygnus Black, who married Druella Rosier and had the 3 Black sisters Bellatrix, Andromeda and Narcissa, as daughters.

Its especially weird as Orion Black is also second cousin to Cygnus Black and Walburga. And even though second cousins are technically legal in a lot of places, its not advisable to marry that close to family.

*** Sirius' parents were second cousins.

It's from the Black family tapestry that was drawn up by J.K. Rowling and auctioned off for charity in early 2006. This family tree only went back to Phineas Nigellus and his siblings, but I think a tapestry used in the OOTP movie dated back a couple more generations. If the website I'm looking at now is correct (I can't be bothered to dig OOTP out of my attic to double check), Kreacher mentioned in chapter 6 of OOTP that the tapestry had been in the family for seven centuries.

[[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/source/other-canon/bft/][Info]] on the tapestry that was auctioned off.

I believe that this [[http://img11.deviantart.net/7400/i/2013/078/8/b/the_noble_house_of_black_family_tree_by_melanie12271994-d5hgu9j.jpg][drawing]] has the names of the generations before Phineas Nigellus that were used in the movies, but it incorporates fanon into other parts of the family tree. The fanon being Charlus Potter and Dorea Black as Harry's grandparents and assuming (unless something was released that I missed) that Barty Crouch Sr. and Jr. are descendant from Charis Black and Caspar Crouch. I believe, but I'm not positive, that Callidora Black and Harfang Longbottom are Neville's ancestors, but according the the first tapestry they had a daughter as well as a son, this family tree doesn't include a daughter. Same issue with the Crouches, the first tapestry mentions 2 daughters.

Edit: Formatting issues and additional info on the second link.
