** The Pureblood Pretense by murkybluematter ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense]]).

Heavily AU, very long, WiP. Only halfway through fourth year so far.

Crossover with Alanna the Lioness. You don't need to have read it to enjoy the fic; it's HP characters/setting with a plot inspired by Alanna.

** Any preferred pairings?

For a really long story that mostly follows the main characters after the end of the series, within cannon as much as possible, my favourite is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian's whole works]]. There are 89 stories that all work together.

Another favourite of mine is the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1374917/Inverarity][Alexandra Quick series]]. There are 5 books so far, for a total of more than a million words.

If you like James/Lily, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5200789/1/The-Life-and-Times][The Life and Times]] is excellent, and has 613k words.

These are probably my two favourite fics.

If you like the way JBern writes he's got a few that are long and quite good. ( I understand that he's not everyones cup of tea and thats fine )

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships.

** Do you like Lily/Snape Marauders era? If so, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/873334/chapters/1677980][The Road Not Taken]] is pretty good. It explores what would have happened if Lily had accepted Snape's apology after the incident by the lake. There are some OCs, but they are mostly well handled and used to flesh out the rest of the students. It hasn't updated in ages, and it is definitely suffering a bit from most of the characters are pairing up syndrome but on the whole a nice, long read.

Do you like crossovers? [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7845282/1/Cardcaptor-Harry][Cardcaptor Harry]] is a nice, fun crossover with (shocking) Cardcaptor Sakura. Unlike a lot of cross over fics that are basically just an excuse to shove a bunch of people into Hogwarts with no real care as to why in the heck they would be there this one handles the blend well. Plus, not set in Hogwarts, so not a rehash of the plot with new people thrown in. Does contain some light Dumbledore bashing. Probably best if you are familiar with Cardcaptors. It is complete at 65k.

Another crossover that is nice and long is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10216252/1/The-Triumph-of-These-Tired-Eyes][The Triumph of These Tired Eyes]].

If you like Harry/Draco then [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/50568][Foundations]] is very good. Explores post Hogwarts healer Harry. Clocks in at 364k for the series.

If you want something on the lighter side [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8197451/1/Fantastic-Elves-and-Where-to-Find-Them][Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them]] is fun. Pre-Hogwarts, no pairings, no bashings (except the Durselys, but it's canon horrible so idek if that counts).

For another nice, light fic try [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15861804/chapters/36950028][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider]]. Featuring squib!Petunia, it focuses on her unconventional job exploring tombs for Gringotts.

Those a few that I haven't seen linked around here, at least recently. Hopefully at least one of them strikes your fancy. Good look staying sane, and stay healthy!

** Prince of the Dark Kingdom: heavily AU (Voldemort won the first war), lots of Norse magic and political intrigue. One of the best plots I've read in a fanfic, though the grammar can be less than stellar. I made it not bother me by counting homophones, but it was still really worth the read. Abandoned but still longer than most.

/linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom]])

The Arithmancer series: from Hermiones POV if she were a math wiz. Lots of fun exploring the use of Arithmancy in spell design, using math as a basis but you don't need to know or even like math to understand and love it. Hews closer to canon in the earlier books and slowly breaks away from it; the break gets really sharp around book 4. Probably my favorite fanfic I've read. Has two sequels.

** Divided and Entwined by Starfox5[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11645676]]

The Wandering Devil by TheWaylandSmith

Epic dark fantasy with universe hopping, questing, and struggling to survive. Voldemort and MoD!Harry are somewhat resigned ally-enemies.

WIP series - Part 4 updated in March 2020 - Ch13

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/683603]]

These two might be the only Harry/Ginny fics I have liked.

The Changeling by Annerb

An AU Slytherin Ginny's story, along with her housemates. Life is hard in the House of Snakes. Goes through all her years at Hogwarts. I liked getting to know and respect her.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/189189]]

Armistice Series by Annerb

Sequel to The Changeling, which should be read first. AU because this is a very Slytherin Ginny, who doesn't get together with Harry until late in her last year at Hogwarts. The whole series is understated het/mostly gen well into the second part of Armistice.

Series is WIP with part 3 completed in January 2020.
