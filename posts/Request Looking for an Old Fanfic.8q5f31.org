It's a Draco/Harry fanfic after they graduate from Hogwarts and they still don't really like each other. Draco is part of some progressive organization but Harry is still wary and judges him. Harry starts to support his cause and they fall in love but Draco has to pretend to be dead and disguise himself as someone else while keeping it a secret. They continue to work together but Harry doesn't know it's him. He starts liking that person and recognizes that he's Draco due to his similar mannerisms. I've been looking for a while and I couldn't find it so thank you if you do! I remember reading it from Archive of our Own.
