** I think it's cannon that the Dursley's didn't allow even Dudley to have a magician in his birthday party, but not sure, probably would have been at the start of PS if it is.

*** I took a quick look through the first few chapters and all I could find was "If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn't, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon --- they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas." Which actually suggests Dudley was allowed to watch cartoons and fantasy things and even that Harry may have been. He was just punished for talking about them I guess.

**** Yeah, I always got the feeling from canon that Harry was allowed to move around the house and what not. He had the same types of things as Dudley, just less/inferior versions of them: a cupboard instead of a room, hand me down clothes, more chores/less free time, even the ice creams at the zoo. It is absolutely still cruel and would take some real emotional healing to address but it's also not flaying his skin or whatever.

***** I don't know about that. I think that Harry's reaction to the abuse is unrealistic, but then not many people really wants to read a realistic story about how a kid copes with abuse. Some people do make the abuse harsher than it was in canon, but Harry is a case study in neglect.

I think the fact that he's perfectly willing to live with an escaped ex-con that he just met instead of the Dursleys is rather telling though.

******* Vernon attempts to throttle Harry at one point and Petunia hits him with stuff she has on hand.

I always took it by Vernon's comment in Philosopher's Stone (about how he should have tried his idea at "beating the magic out of Harry") however that they never beat Harry as extensively as fanon would have it be believed.

And to be totally honest, in that area they would not have been much worse than most parents at that point in time, a smack here and there, a backhand etc.

Dudley on the other hand, did beat up Harry and Petunia and Vernon did nothing.

******** Yeah, you're right, I should have qualified my point with that. From what I recall, there's not much in the text that supports anything worse than what would have been acceptable for corporal punishment for a boy in the 90s. We can see this in the 3rd book, when Harry tells Marge that he got lots of canings at school - at least in the US, paddling was still an acceptable punishment in the 90s.

So I don't think the Dursleys were much worse in that area to Harry.

******* The Dursleys did physically abuse Harry though

In the fifth book when Harry is seeing what he might want to pursue as a career he sees that he could get a job that had something to do with muggles and the only requirements were ‘an owl in muggle studies and a good sense of fun' and Harry thought something like ‘living with the Dursleys I need more of a sense of when to duck'

That sounded so weird but it's late at night and I haven't read the book in a while so I'm just going off of what I remember

****** we know magical people are more physically resilent

so maybe magical people are also mentally more reslient

Child abuse does damage the brain and cause it to develop in incorrect ways so maybe accidental magic actually stops the damage

so while you might have the memories and some of the personality traits of an abused child you wouldnt have the brain chemistry

***** Yes, fanon abuse is greatly exaggerated. Mostly the Dursleys are just the 'evil step parents' trope. Harry's never afraid of them, he mocks them, argues back, and generally regards them as ridiculous people.

*** Harry winced at the painful landing of Uncle Vernon's harsh reaction of his knee-jerk response to Dudley's book. All in all he had been in the same class as Dudley for the last few years and his report card didn't hold much back in regard to the younger Dursleys literacy skill.

He wouldn't deny that he was curious about the book that Dudley had brought home, after all it was the first book, he could recall, that Dudley had brought home or had seemed to be interested in reading. That alone was enough to make him interested enough to look at the book.

** I could see Dudley getting really into D&D and when he learns that Harry is truly a wizard (or if known already), taking some of those elements of what he might fitness when he makes characters who use magic. Maybe he and Harry start playing D&D together at some point, and even though Dudley is horrible to Harry otherwise, this would be the one thing both of them bonded over, slowly becoming closer and maybe even Dudley playing D&D and having his/others characters using magic etc, would make him think better of Harry...

At some point, he has some friends invite him to a tabletop gaming session. He elects to play a brainless barbarian warrior.

** Harry was nervous and doing his best to ignore the cold, building feeling that made it feel like a snake was slowly squeezing his stomach. He just knew he was going to be punished hard this time, at least a lot of yelling and being hungry in the dark.

This time, something really scary had happened during the biweekly free period he would spend running for his life from Dudley and his friends. Just as he was really running out of breath, and the panic of the ensuing mocking and hitting exploded out of him like fire.

Suddenly he was on the roof, far away from Dudley but suddenly in a much more dire situation. Not that he couldn't get down from the roof. Harry was no stranger to climbing to get away from his troubles, but once he got to the edge of the roof and was about to climb down, he locked eyes with his cousin across the playground.

Dudley didn't chase him, didn't call out to his friends. Dudley just kept staring at him the rest of the schoolday, his eyebrows scrunched together in thought.

Dudley was going to tell on him, just like when he'd turned his teacher's hair blue and Uncle Vernon had pulled on his ear so hard Harry thought it'd tear right off.

As Harry reached reached the edge of Privet Drive, the snake in his gut felt like a ten foot python with an insatiable dry-ice addiction, but his anxiety came to a confused, stuttering end when Dudley came out of the front door, looking just as pale as Harry felt he did himself.

"H-Harry, wait. I wanna talk to you." Dudley spoke as he leaned in closer and continued in a whisper "/away/ from Mum and Dad"

"I'm not gonna get yelled at for not coming right home and doing my chores?" Harry retorted, seeing the obvious trap.

"Look, I already told Mum I was going to make you drag my bike up that big hill near Tesco, we won't be back for hours. I just, Just /please/ Harry" Dudley begged, his shaking voice almost giving out as he kept scanning the neighbourhood "We can't talk about it here, it could be /dangerous/"

Dudley Didn't lead him behind Tesco, or made him drag a bike around. Instead he pulled out a beautiful, colourful book, showing him page after page and babbling an explanation about a book that was also a game, about spells and levels classes.

Dudley was explaining one spell with particular enthusiasm, but struggling with the bigger words. Harry read the description around his cousin's chubby index finger and picked up where Dudley began to falter.

"Dimension door allows the caster to instantly transfer themself from their current location to any other spot within range" Harry read dilligently, then came to a crashing conclusion. "You're saying I cast a spell... like a wizard?"

"Not quite, you didn't have a spellbook or a staff or anything." Dudley beamed triumphantly and began turning back through the book, almost to the very beginning before exclaiming. "You're a sorcerer, Harry! A bloody /level seven/ sorcerer if this book is telling the truth."

The two cousins kept talking, quietly and nervously about the totally awesome things Harry was /supposed/ to be able to do with this newfound discovery, but when the subject turned to which bloodline he was supposed to have, his cousin's ideas started getting stranger and scarier.

"You see it runs in families, but not everyone has it. I don't think I have it or anything, but maybe your Mum and Dad /did/. Maybe they didn't die in a car crash, maybe they blew up in a wild magic fireball, maybe the MI6 took them away and they managed to hide you away with us."

The shaking in Dudley's voice from the front porch was back in full force and Harry was starting to empathize as the realizations kept hammering into his poor mind.

"I think Dad knows something, but doesn't really understand or maybe doesn't believe in it." Dudley continued. " Mum definitely knows something and I think she's scared. I think she's scared whatever happened to your Mum will happen to you, too."

** Dudley doesn't read. If he was interested in D&D, he'd play it on a computer.

The famous [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizardry][Wizardry]] computer game was available in Europe as early as 1983, and the Dursleys could easily afford the necessary computer hardware by the time Dudley was old enough to use a computer.
