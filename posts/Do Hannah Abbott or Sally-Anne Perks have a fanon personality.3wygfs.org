You know, like Daphne Greengrass who's a pureblood "ice princess" or Tracy Davis, who's usually halfblood or muggleborn and excitable.

** Hannah is usually the female Neville, pudgy, blonde and nice. And joined at the hip to Susan Bones.

Sally-Anne is dead in fanon.

*** Owing to the fact that Hannah takes over the Leaky Cauldron, is a Hufflepuff with rosy cheeks and somehow caught the attention of the living god Longbottom, we can assume she is an outgoing, happy and attractive witch of no small merit. Fanon extends this to include her as Susan's twin in the realm of unsubstantiated but bombastic boobs.

Fanon of Sally-Anne Perks is that she was in Hermione's dorm until she was forgotten. I've seen at least one version that had her as a devoutly religious muggleborn whose parents pulled her from Hogwarts somewhere between Hermione's encounter with the Troll and the return of Voldemort at the end of book four.

  Harry recalls that a pale little girl called Sally-Anne was sorted into Hufflepuff during his first year, but no one else remembers her. Was there really a Sally-Anne? Harry and Hermione set out to solve the chilling mystery of the lost Hogwarts student.

I agree that 'battle god' is not an appropriate title for Neville. Frankly, none of the good guys deserve it. They took part in a few dozen small scale fights and got lucky a lot. The one closest to deserving the title, the battle scarred Mad Eye, bites it during a poorly thought out mission. They've got a ways to go to match the like of Pericles or Chesty Puller.

Two things: First, since when does posing in your whitey tighties indicate battle godhood? Second, that isn't Neville, that is Matt Lewis.

Considering some of the other crap that goes on in the magical world, someone being able to turn into or at least make themselves look like a plant isn't exactly farfetched.

** I kept Sally-Anne in my fic (briefly) but made her a bit dim. I quite like the fanon that she got pregnant and had to leave Hogwarts for a bit haha

As for Hannah, I think most people just write her as the epitome of Hufflepuffness. Kind, a bit quiet and shy, English-rose in appearance.

** Hannah Abbott I think of as somewhat shy, sometimes she has a crush on Neville or the other way around, curly hair, friends with Susan who is the outgoing one, Hannah has blond hair while Susan's is brown. Nothing about Sally-Anne. Pretty sure she doesn't exist in most fanon
