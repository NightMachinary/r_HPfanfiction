So I read this fanfic years ago. I thought I had it saved on my fanfiction.net but either I was mistaken or it's been deleted. It's about an Original Character who is from a universe where HP are just books and is pulled into our universe by the Founders. He is super OP (i think he is given powers by each founder) is paired with Hermione and tries to help Harry on the down low. I thought the title was something like "Harry Potter and the Sword of Godrick Gryfindor" but no luck.

** Hmm...well, I understand this one is about a fan being pulled into the HP universe: linkffn(10851278)

He's ludicrously OP, but I haven't actually read the story so I'm not sure if his powers are from the founders.
