I wonder how Dumbledore, the Parents, and the ministry would respond.


** Here is one written as an interview but it's Neville that snaps instead of Harry.

  Time and time again the Bad Guys do bad things and get away with it. Time and time again the Good Guys take the low blow and just soldier on with their upper lips stiff. What might happen if someone couldn't hold it together? How would Magical Britain react? More to the point; who would they blame? A little One-Shot in documentary style.

** Unspeakable Things, linkffn(6473434)

Department of Mysteries played a big role here. It trained Harry and Ginny into a killer couple. Luna had an interesting characterization. Later they wiped out most of the upper Slytherin years in self defense. This story has the highest body count of any HP fanfic I have read.

  Formerly Defense for Two. Adopted from Perspicacity with permission. They thought Lockhart was a fraud. They were wrong; he was their guide into a world of danger, adventure, intrigue and other Unspeakable Things.

*** I thought of this one as well in response to the OP. The story turned out a bit darker than I was expecting when DM picked it up. (This was before he wrote /Firebird/ trilogy and /Broken Chains/.)
