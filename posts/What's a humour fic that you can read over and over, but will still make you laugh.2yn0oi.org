For me, it's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4357627/1/Scorpius-Malfoy-and-the-Improbable-Plot][Scorpius Malfoy and the Improbable Plot]]. It's unfinished but to be honest it doesn't really make that much of a difference anyway. As the name implies, it's not really about the plot. Highly highly recommended.

Anyone else?

**** I don't mean to be a dick, but have you ever heard of our lord and savior Google? I know its the first result for me, and though that very well may be because of the targeting algorithms (specifically the fact that I'm always googling harry potter and fanfiction shit), I know for a fact that googling "nonjon fanfiction" will have him as the first result, or if you're feeling really fancy, you could try looking it up on fanfiction.net itself. Or, even better, for shits and giggles you could try shortlinking the username to see if it exists and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Enonjon][https://www.fanfiction.net/~nonjon]] [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Enonjon][holy shit it does exist!]]

*** It's wonderful.

Could it be considered a crack fic given how out-of-character Ron is through most of the story? I'm not really clear on the distinction.

If you want another rec, I suggest [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5501817/1/Something-Wicked-This-Way-Comes][Something Wicked This Way Comes]] by The Mad Mad Reviewer. A weird HP/Disgaea crossover with humor, horror, and romance. You don't need to have played Disgaea to read it, FYI.

And now, I go to read about the adventures of Ron Weasley, Triwizard Champion.

*** Same author as the one I mentioned in the original post haha. Someone in [[/r/harrypotter]] mentioned Ginny/Harry's naming practices, and the first thing I thought of was The Wendell That Wasn't. The second was this bit from Scorpius Malfoy and the Improbable Plot where Harry says that at least his name choices were better than Humphrey/Mudd/Giggles after the characters from Martin Miggs the Mad Muggle comic books.

This one isn't really a humor fic intentionally but a I still got a few laughs out of it.
