** Wonderfully dark and morbid I like it, it does bear the discussion of what materials could be used as cores. I don't think canonically wands have magic, they just focus the castor's magic, which is why wandless spells are possible, like brooms they're just a tool for the caster's own power.

The discussion could be had how effective would cores made out of such morbid things but there isn't much canon info. We know Fleur has veela hair from her grandmother, does that mean veela hair works well for veelas or does it work well for Fleur for a different reason more for her temperament? Would Vampire fang work well for Half-vampires? It's interesting to think about.

*** I read a fic a long time ago I can't find again where Hermione edited a law Umbridge passed to make Death Eaters classified as dark creatures and then made a wand using Lucius' tendons and it worked extra well on Draco

(Umbridge had planned for it to be for werewolves and the way laws worked in this world just changing the writing on a piece of paper was legally and magically binding for some reason)
