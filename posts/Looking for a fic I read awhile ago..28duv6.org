I'm looking for a fic that takes place during the Marauder's era and stars Hermione. She goes back in time, ends up being about 11, winds up in Grimmauld Place and is adopted by Walburga. She goes to school with the Marauders, and has a relationship with both Sirius and Remus(separately), but I think the pairing was Hermione/Remus, not sure though. She becomes a death eater spy for the light and has to be Voldemort's consort. I don't remember if it was complete or not and I'm almost positive I read it on ff.net. It was most likely rated M. Thanks very much!


** I'm pretty sure that's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233539/1/The-Last-Marauder][The Last Marauder]]. It's been a while since I read it, but I think it meets all of the criteria!
