Am fine with het/slash/femslash, etc. Doesn't have to focus on pairings

Can be completed or not. Can be on any site, any length is fine, etc.

They can still be comic relief type characters, but I'd like for them to be more.


** They have a bit more depth in this:

  Taking an aging potion was Fred and George Weasley's backup plan for getting past Dumbledore's age line in GoF. Their initial idea, though... Well, finding themselves 18 years in the past was not part of the plan. Marauders era. No bashing.

** This is a Draco/George fic but I like that it's George offering redemption rather than the classic Harry or Hermione.

Edit to add: this is post war, so no Fred.

  “All of this happened because you lost your magic, you know," she says. Draco lets out a small, quiet burst of laughter at the realization. “God,” he says. “Do you know what? I think it might have been worth it.”

** You might try our SI fic, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27126473/chapters/66241571][Madness of Ravens]]. The fraction of F&G is still a bit low, but I hope to put out more of the stuff.

** I realize I am a little late to this thread but I wanted to recommend Playing with Fire by AKABlueKat! A phenomenal story centered around an OC and Fred Weasley who have decided to enter into a fake relationship to make their desired partners jealous, and it goes exactly as planned I assure you ;)

I know this author has several other stories focusing on Fred and George, but this is the only one I have read (so far)!

  "Fred Weasley, you're asking me to be your fake girlfriend." "Spot on." He was crazy. His plan was crazy. And yet, I hesitated. Why? I really can't say. Maybe it was the way Fred's eyes glinted in the half-dark of the garden, hinting at possibility and promising me something I didn't quite understand. Maybe I was tired of being careful.
