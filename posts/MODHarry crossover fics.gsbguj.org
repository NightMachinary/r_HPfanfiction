  On one hand, he feels like he should have seen this coming. On the other, he can't evidently see how anyone could have really put all the pieces together. (mod!fem!Harry).

** - *Potter's Protector* - Harry Potter- linkffn(7665632)
- *M-Day* - Marvel - linkffn(8804823)
- *Death's Little Brother* - DC (Smallville/Television) - linkffn(9628789)
- *Full Circle* - Buffy the Vampire Slayer - linkffn(12022968)

This series starts with Xander Harris (from Buffy the Vampire Slayer) getting dropped into Hogwarts during the Troll attack in first year. He ends up adopting Harry and teaching him along the way. Eventually, Harry becomes the Master of Death.

Each of the "sequels" (which some are unfinished, but end in spots where it can continue if need be) are stand-alone jaunts into that specific universe.

TL;DR: There are Aspects of Existence (Death, Love, Magic, Time, Existence, ???) where they govern everything under that topic. Harry ends up as Death. He essentially destroys Evil souls, and guides lost souls to the other side. He's also the Avatar of Magic, so he spreads that too.

He ends up making every universe a Utopia of sorts: Magic for all, planetary leadership, etc.

The Smallville one is my favorite, as Harry isn't the main character, Clark is.

â€‹

Some people don't like it because of the whole "harem" vibe thing. Which I chalk up to immortality. Or Soul Mates really being soul bonds, which doesn't have to mean romantic love.

  The spirit of Hogwarts believes that Harry has suffered enough in his eleven years of life and calls in a protector to guide and care for him. Not slash, rating for violence in later chapters.

  M-Day. A day that would go down in history as the emergence of a new breed of humans. The Magicals. It all started with one individual who thought he was there to save the mutants. Sequel to Potter's Protector, rating for violence and swearing, no slash.

  Harry, Neville, Clark and the rest have each known Xander Harris as their father, grandfather, father-in-law, etc. Now they want to try and do for him what he did for them, by saving him from a bad home and a life fraught with death and despair.
