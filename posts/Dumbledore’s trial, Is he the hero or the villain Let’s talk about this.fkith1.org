A discussion in discovering if Dumbledore is really a manipulative overlord or an old man thrust in situations that he shouldn't be involved and trying to give it his best.

RULES: Cannon elements only, it needs to be things that are actually shown or at least mentioned in cannon. Supplementary information only about things put in Pottermore or real world information about the time-period In case of arguments talking about the muggle world. If you are arguing about something Dumbledore did that seems manipulative please, try to take a guess at his motives and why would he need to do it. And last but no less important remember to remain civil, this is something we're doing for fun, no need to get mad at each other.


** I am going to just copy paste an old bit I wrote on the matter of Dumbledore. IMO, he's an infinitely more complicated and interesting character than, say, Snape. He's actually Grey, not just shadowed charcoal like the latter.

I think the big problem with Dumbledore is that people fundamentally fail to understand the character. They either think that he's a moustache-twirling machiavellian secret villain, or that he's a doddering idealist fool.

The truth is neither. Dumbledore's character in my opinion is itself an inherent conflict. He is both an idealist and a pragmatist.

He would like to just be able to quietly run his school in peace. He believes himself unfit to rule more than that. But he also has never been able to bring himself to stay uninvolved, in anything, and in the fifty-odd years between Grindelwald's fall and Voldemort's return, he has the power and reputation to do essentially whatever the fuck pleases him.

So despite the fact that all he wants to do is be Headmaster, he has this feeling of obligation that he must choose to remain Chief Warlock, he must choose to remain Supreme Mugwump, because somebody else could have gotten it wrong.

But in so doing, he stretches himself too thin, which is why he has all these mistakes that people point to as evidence that he's incompetent or malicious. In truth, he just doesn't have enough hours in the day.

** If the person who's pronouncing judgement on Dumbledore is affected adversely by Dumbledore's numerous schemes, then he's the villain. If not, he's the hero.

Personally, I lean towards the villain side. He had numerous chances to nip Voldemort in the bud, not to mention all the leeway he gives the Slytherins. His treatment of his comrades in the Order is downright sickening, same with his handling of Draco's plot to murder him. He decides to ignore the execution of Crouch Jr, which happened while he held a very exalted position in the Wizengamot and the ICW, and pretend like it never happened - that is a complete breakdown of law and order.

His shenanigans involving the Philosopher's Stone, Chamber of Secrets, Triwizard Tournament are...well, we've heard that several times. His hiring choices also leave a lot to be desired.

This is my view, and I know it's quite biased against him. He's written the way he is because this is a children's story, but in real life, someone like him would be at the centre of a lot of controversy.

*** This reply really irks me, especially the 'he could've nipped the Voldemort issue in the bud whenever he wanted' despite Dumbledore being the one wizard Voldemort feared, he and Voldemort seemed to be on par,

And there's us zero evidence of Voldemorts immortality aka horcruxes until chamber of secrets, only dumbledore's suspicions because of the mystery of Halloween 1981. If you look at how each horcruxe is found all are circumstantial to harry except the lake obviously, so how could Dumbledore possibly have found them.

** dumbledore is not a villain but he's not a hero either he's used to having positions of power and seems to view himself as the master of a game he is manipulative but he genuinely believes he is right the road to hell is paved with good intentions and sometimes dumbledore genuinely seams to chose good options but a lot of the time he does things the easy way without looking for a second opinion he often does things for a majority rather than a single person he is very secretive and he seems to have complete power over the order he believes to often in second chances he always thinks he has the moral high ground he doesn't understand wars and so he probably shouldn't be leading the war usually wars don't stop when one person is killed he doesn't understand that in wars people die he isn't great at strategy his plans usually could fall through if one thing happened differently if he is afraid of something he will hold off till he has no other choice this is my annalisis of albus dumbledore once you read fanfiction dumbledore will never again be the sparkly eyed headmaster who can do no wrong from your childhood

** Dumbledore as a manipulative mastermind/villain is something I only heard about from fanfic readers. But there's that scene in canon where after Lily dies, Dumbledore tells Snape that Harry survived and has Lily's eyes and there's that 'you remember the shape of Lily Evans's eyes' bit. He does want to get Snape to help him. Those who dislike Dumbledore say he's manipulating him. Though someone actually said this wasn't true.Dumbledore is supposed to care about his students and yet he hires Lockhart to expose him. And so essentially he gets to use his position for his own ends. Exposing someone is all well and good, but students shouldn't suffer because of that. I think, and this is only my opinion, that he even hired Firens to put Umbridge in her place. This was sort of 'you're not going to tell me what I can and can't do, Dolores.' He even showed up in Remus's life when Dumbledore had something he wanted Remus to do. So he can do something good, but that isn't necessarily out of the kindness of his heart or care for the students. And there's the whole Draco issue. He let Draco go pretty far and had Ron died, he would have said oh I'm so sorry. I'm guessing he wanted to keep Snape who had given the unbreakable vow but still. I'm not entirely sure Dumbledore doesn't want to be in all those positions of power. After all, he pretty much does what he wants at that school. I think he knows he is smart and this has made him arrogant,' being cleverer than most men...' He doesn't give Harry enough info but nor does he tell his order members anything. But this last point is because it's a kids' book and they are the heroes. He definitely didn't want to be put in a position of being the one responsible for the fate of the wizarding world, but he isn't just a nice old man even if we set aside his unenviable position. He leaves Harry with the Dursleys and then lectures them in HbP. I was always so annoyed with him there as it's completely pointless to lecture them at that point. He comes across as very arrogant there, with the air of one being prepared to lecture people on the matters of life and have fun while doing so. I don't know about his further manipulation, though, as it's difficult to make sense of PS and his actions there.

** You have to specify if we are going to look at his actions from a Watsonian perspective or a Doylist perspective.

** This will explain far better than I ever could ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPRankdown/comments/4gffw4/albus_dumbledore/]]). In short, Dumbledore is man who cared about Harry so much, he was unable to act for the greater good, a philosophy he had long since eschewed. He was an unbelievably brave man.

Some notable quotes from the above post are included.

#+begin_quote
  Snape being the proficient Legilimens that he is, it is interesting that Dumbledore would close his eyes in front of him and especially that Rowling would mention the status of Dumbledore's eyes three times in the span of a single conversation. Dumbledore is brilliant at Occlumency and might be able to hide his thoughts from Snape, but not all magic is infallible, and so whatever Dumbledore feels the need to conceal is probably of the utmost importance and cannot risk Snape finding out.

  So what could he be concealing? We know that Dumbledore knows Harry will survive --- why not tell Snape? Besides the fact that Snape really doesn't need to know, it would be incredibly risky for another person to walk around with that knowledge. If it ever came back to Voldemort that he was unable to kill Harry, then Voldemort might have someone else kill him instead (in which case, Harry would die, because the protection from Lily in Voldemort's blood only counts if Voldemort is the one to kill him). What appears to be Dumbledore's nonchalance at Harry's death is actually an incredibly important moment in ensuring that Harry survives.

  A weakened Voldemort is an easier Voldemort to kill. Essentially, Dumbledore's plan not only gave Harry an option to survive, but made Voldemort infinitely weaker. It was the hardest thing Dumbledore ever had to do --- much harder than fighting Grindelwald. But he'd finally learned from his experience with Grindelwald and the mistakes he made with Harry. He wasn't going to wait years and watch people die like he'd done with Grindelwald. Despite his love for Harry, he finally did what was right rather than what was easy. He found a right answer in a situation with no right answer. He won the war, and not through force, not through dueling, but through /love/. Not through the abilities of Voldemort and Harry (for surely Voldemort would have won that way), but through the /choices/ he knew they each would make.
