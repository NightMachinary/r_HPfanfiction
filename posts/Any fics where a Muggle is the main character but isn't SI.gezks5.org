  When only one Hogwarts letter arrives for identical twin sisters, Juliet and Jennifer Belstone find themselves separated for the first time in their lives. Desperate to be reunited, they ask...could a Squib ever become a witch? And so their quest begins: a difficult and dangerous search for a source of magical power. Can they ever bridge the divide?
