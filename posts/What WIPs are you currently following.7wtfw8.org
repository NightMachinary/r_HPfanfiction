#+begin_quote
  In which Harry Potter learns that even an unbroken soul is not immutable, and that everything has a price. The price of love is loss; the price of knowledge is understanding; the price of life is death; and the price of mastering Death...is far more than he ever wanted to pay. A continuation of Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux.

** These are all the WIPs that I will drop everything (outside of work) to read when I see they updated

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome): I have written about my love of this fic many times, so I feel no need to do so here.

linkffn(Victoria Potter by Taure): The new fic by Taure who has easily the most encompassing and subtle understanding of the canon magic system. A vastly superior rewrite to his now-taken-down Alexandra Potter.

linkffn(Limpieza de Sangre by TheEndless7): A fem!Voldemort and easily TE7's best work.

linkffn(Ascended Vices by Scott Press): The sequel to *the* Dark!Harry (IMO).

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

  Growing up as the middle child of war heroes is already hard enough as it is. How much harder can it be when everyone seems to think that you're a little girl? That's what the second-born child of Neville and Hannah Longbottom asks all the time, as he's the only one that knows the truth: he's a boy, no matter what everyone else tells him. He is Dean Longbottom. This is his story.

** "Harry Potter and the Lack of Lamb Sauce" is still going on strong. Gordon Ramsay teaches Potions at Hogwarts, and holds a cooking competition, and it's awesome. linkao3(12805206)

Also following the "Son of the Archer" series, where Ron is kidnapped as a baby and ends up raised by Clint "Hawkeye" Barton. Currently it's on its third story, "Son of the Archer and the Year of the Egos." Technically the writing isn't as solid in this one as in the others, but content-wise it really works. linkffn(12796500)

"Magical Metamorphosis" is about a transgender Harry, and while I don't really buy that transgenderism would be something new and unfamiliar to the wizarding world, the story is a good one. linkffn(12507814)

The "Weasley Girl" series. Ron Weasley was born a girl, and things went from there. Currently the second novel-length story, "Secrets of the Past" is almost done, and the author says there'll be a third one. Updates are notoriously sporadic, but I love the writing on this one. linkao3(3793561)

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome) - The rare updates connected with fic's quality are truly torturous.

linkffn(Victoria Potter by Taure) - Taure is my favourite HP fic writer, and Alexandra was my favourite fic of his. That's a new, pretty different take on it and despite only beginning already one of my favourites.

linkffn(Black Luminary) - AU (probably) non-BWL Harry adopted by Blacks. But different from most of fics of this type. Blacks aren't ideal, and Harry isn't infallible (to the contrary he screws up BIG time).

linkffn(The Old Blood by Oil on Canvas) - Pretty fun AU with Arthurian elements in the background. Sadly updates slowed down.

linkffn(Matou Shinji and the Broken Chains) - Yet another part of Matou Shinji series. As usual, crazy stuff happens and despite being crossover it's the only fic to use more obscure aspects of canon as basis of plot points. I'm behind on that one, because there was lull in releases (it used to get new chapters at least weekly), but now it settled in semimonthly releases so I will catch up).

linkffn(An Unfound Door) - Can work on this fic be counted as "in progress"? Not sure, but this is a fic where Joe finally managed to not bloat his work into boringness. With good effects.

That concludes good WIPs that I follow.

  Once upon a time, there was a young boy in Britain. When he was 11 years old, he traveled on a magical journey to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he discovered the many joys of magic. Over the course of seven years, with the mentorship of a powerful wizard, he learned the Power of Love and True Friendship, and with his friends by his side, he defeated the terrible Dark Lord Voldemort and saved the Wizarding World forever.This is not quite that story.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Nighttime was the worst part of Harry's summer. He'd fall asleep, prepared for nightmares. He'd find his nightmares, and when he was startled awake, he'd lie in bed, thinking his mother or father were downstairs, probably having similar nightmares. There was nothing about sleep anymore that held comfort for him.--- --- ---  How different would the world of Harry Potter be if James and Lily had lived?

  It didn't matter that Harry fell asleep thinking about a busy Saturday in Diagon Alley, or digging through the attic with his father, Sirius, and Uncle Remus. It didn't matter that he went to bed with a stomach full of warm food, or that his mother tucked him into bed even though he was fourteen and he didn't need it, but she still did it because she loved him and he loved her.None of that mattered; the nightmares still came.--- --- ---How different would the world of Harry Potter be if James and Lily had lived?

  It wasn't exactly the worst birthday ever. Harry was used to birthdays being spent with his parents, and with Sirius, and with Uncle Remus. He was used to his birthdays being quiet affairs, but this year he'd wanted a real birthday party. Not necessarily a big grand event, like for his eleventh birthday. Maybe just Ron and Hermione, or maybe he could invite all the boys in his dormitory too, and then there was his friends on the Quidditch team, and of course Susan and Hannah, and Padma and Lavender.----How different would the world of Harry Potter be if James and Lily had lived?

  Mr. and Mrs. Potter were not perfectly ordinary people. They did not live on an ordinary street like you or I. They did not have a small house with a number to differentiate it from the identical houses on either side of it. They had, in fact, quite the opposite of it all.----How different would the world of Harry Potter be if James and Lily had lived?

  Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways. Of course, there were many things about Harry that were normal: He loved summer vacation. He loved sports. And most of all, he loved his family.--- --- ---How different would the world of Harry Potter be if James and Lily had lived? Ships not listed because I am uncertain if they will deviate from canon.
