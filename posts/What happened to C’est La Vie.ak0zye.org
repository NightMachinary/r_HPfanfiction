** The author still posts other fics so they didn't just disappear.I think as they posted all 9 chapters in a single week,they worked on this fic for a while and put out what they felt was satisfactory for a while.It's not confirmed abandoned but it probably takes a long time to update.

** I loved Orion Black, and the story was just easy and feel good. Still holding a small hope it will continue one day!

** The author doesn't plan anything and writes whenever she feels like it. It is what it is.
