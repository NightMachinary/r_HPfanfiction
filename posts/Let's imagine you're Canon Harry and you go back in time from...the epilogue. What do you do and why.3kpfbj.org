Do you tell Dumbledore?

Destroy the Horcruxes?

Kill Quirrel instantly?

Get sorted differently?


** The real problem is the scarcrux. I think Harry and Dumbledore working together can mop up all the regular horcruxes pretty quickly.

I can't see any way to get rid of Harry's scarcrux though - the way in Deathly Hallows was so specific to the circumstances, and even replicating those circumstances wouldn't work - JKR explicitly said engineering the same situation would not lead to the same result, which seems to imply that the knowledge and beliefs of the characters involved is key. If Harry goes in thinking he'll survive, he won't. He has to /believe/ he's a sacrifice to avoid dying.

As an alternative I suppose they could set a trap for Voldemort in first year or 4th year and try to imprison his spirit instead of killing him. They then just have to keep him imprisoned until Harry dies a natural death, at which time Voldemort loses the last anchor for his disembodied soul and it moves on.

**** I actually considered this in The One He Feared:

#+begin_quote
  Everything he knew about horcruxes told him one thing: the only way to destroy one was to destroy the physical vessel. He had to die.

  Harry was generally opposed to that plan. Unfortunately he could think of no alternatives: he briefly entertained the idea of being killed and resuscitated, but he doubted such a "sacrifice" would be sufficient. The intent to be resuscitated would interfere with the magic. Nor did he think he could simply obliviate himself of the intent. The magic of the soul ran deep and couldn't be tricked by technicalities. The only way to destroy the horcrux within him was to genuinely die.

Completely fanon of course, but to me it rings true of the way HP magic works. It tends not to be easily exploited.

Do what /Backwards With Purpose/ did. That is, have somebody else who knows the secret, say Dumbledore (after Harry tells him) obliviate him, or modify his memory to believe something else. That's what Ella did -- Albus modified Harry's memory to make him believe that his survival his previous time was because he owned all three Deathly Hallows and was the Master of Death. Proceed to steal/destroy one of the Deathly Hallows to make this no longer valid.

Messy, but would work. Probably. Your son time travelling from the future seven times to see that everything goes right in spite of Daddy's fuck-ups would definitely help though.

Be an average happy-go-lucky student by day, hire contract killers by night. Leave Voldemort completely alone, just kill off all his supporters. I never saw Voldemort as the problem, I saw him as a symptom of a deeper problem. Would Hitler have been half as dangerous without his Nazi supporters?

** I can't imagine myself as canon Harry as I'm too different from canon Harry in /everything/. I would never willingly walk to my death, even if all of my friends depended on it - I would try to find another way, but I would never walk to my death, even if it was the only way. Call me selfish, but I suppose that's just how I am.

I think I would be sorted into Ravenclaw, with the intent of gaining as much knowledge (and therefore, power) as I possibly could. Not just to defeat Voldemort, but because I would never be able to live with myself if I didn't exceed my own expectations with the information and knowledge available at Hogwarts.

--------------

First year, I would steal the stone for myself before Quirrel. I would hide it somewhere far away, maybe find a way to integrate it with my own being. Leave a fake for Quirrel, perhaps? A trap, maybe? I'm sure I would come up with something.

*I would never, /ever/ attend* DADA or History, nor any detentions, because screw those. I'm Harry Potter, what are they going to do if I don't attend, expel me? Pfft.

--------------

Second year, I would use my newfound knowledge to liberate Sirius, assuming I'm anywhere near capable to do such a thing.

Regardless, I would bring Pettigrew to light, freeing Sirius anyways.

I would lock down the Chamber of Secrets, steal the diary from Ginny (if she would have it) and give it to Dumbledore, telling him about the Horcruxes and the traps on each of them, so he wouldn't die this time around. I'd let him do the rest, as I would have shit to learn and would rather not go prancing about to search for deadly objects capable of possession.

--------------

After this, things are too unpredictable. The Voldemort problem is solved, I'm immortal, and what the hell do I do now? Apprentice under Dumbledore? Confund the Triwizard Cup to take me anyways? Take over the world? Challenge(s) accepted.

Emeric the Evil was a short-lived but exceptionally aggressive wizard. He was once the master of the Elder Wand and, with it, he terrorised the south of England in the early Middle Ages. He was "slaughtered" in a ferocious duel against Egbert the Egregious.

Be sure not to confuse him for Uric the oddball though.

Uric the Oddball was a medieval wizard, who became famous for his eccentric behaviour, such as wearing a jellyfish as a hat, and sleeping in a room with fifty pet Augureys. He is considered to be one of the weirdest wizards in history, and, as such, is often the punchline of wizarding jokes.

** I go back because the number of casualties were too high. Not just in the seventh, book, but throughout the series.

I tell Dumbledore that I time-travelled and that I am going to be changing things, but I don't tell him everything. In part because I now know he's fallible, and in part as a bit of revenge for all the "I'll tell you later" shit he pulled on me.

I'd leave the diary and the cup alone at first, but the locket, diadem and ring I'd destroy at the first opprotunity. I'd keep an eye on what Lucius does and his possible victims for the diary. Just because Ginny got it last time doesn't mean she'll get it again. The cup can wait until fourth year at least, which gives me time to plan a better way to break into Gringotts.

One of the few things I'd tell Dumbledore right away is that Quirrel is possessed. We both then spend the rest of my first year giving him the runaround and otherwise distracting him before trapping and killing him at the end of the year in such a way that Voldemort no idea as to who killed him.

I would let the Sorting Hat put me wherever it felt I belonged. Regardless of where I end up, I still intend to befriend Ron, Hermione, Neville, Luna and Ginny while reaching out more to other Houses. I will also try to give Draco a chance and change him for the better. If his seventeen - year-old self could show signs of having a change of heart, then starting on him earlier could help him be a better person. If he's still a prat, no big loss.

I let Pettigrew get away so Voldemort will have his assistant for the ritual. I let Voldemort kidnap me, and only me, to use my blood. I let him use the Killing Curse on me, killing the Horcrux inside me. Once I regain consciousness, I use a portkey I arranged with Dumbledore to get out of there. At this point, Voldemort is confused, frightened, and has only one Horcrux. Finishing him off would be simple.

I am too lazy to quote through the books or something, you can think what you want, for me their relationship seemed build on Ginnys love for the boy-who-lived. Harry never cared for her for years, and then suddenly there is some spark? Seems to me like she was not much more than an easy way to find comfort during a time of trouble. Compare that to Cho who Harry was smitten by the moment she saw her.

And looking at the marauders map is kind of the wizarding equivalent of doing some light facebook stalking imo, which is completly natural for me, as is having feelings for some exes, if you don't have them you are a sicko.
