I was just reading the fic Worthy of Magic and I realised that the void, or Harry's magic, acts kind of like a stand does in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. This has evolved into a desire to read more fics where magic acts as a or similar to a stand. Does anyone have any fix recommendations that fit this curiosity?

*** In broad terms, a "Stand" is the physical manifestation of a character's supernatural abilities in Jojo's Bizarre Adventure. They generally take the form of a humanoid figure standing next to the person (hence the name) and are invisible to those who do not have a Stand of their own. If you've ever played a Persona game, the concept of a Persona is basically identical to that of a Stand, minus the Jungian psychological symbolism.
