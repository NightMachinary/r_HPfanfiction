What the title says, a Harry Potter that was raised by the Punisher, met the punisher at some point, or becomes the punisher himself, to rid the world of the Death Eaters.. Violently.

It's a one shot and is more inspired by the Punisher. But it definitely has enough of a ring that you won't be disappointed

  One-Shot, inspired by the Punisher. A violent vengeance is exacted. Warnings for violence, and pretty much bashes everyone except Harry.

**** hahah, that was definitely interesting. A little disturbing that Harry killed the entire Order and all his old friends, but intense none the less.
