hi there! i'm desperately looking for one of my favourite stories. unfortunately it seems to have disappeared from FF.net :(

can't remember the title nor the authors name, but main plot parts stayed with me:

TMR/OMC = Tom and Adrian are Harrys birthparents (not sure if there's a name change along the road) Dumbledore is actually a Dark Lord and Tom a figurehead of the rebels. Dumbles convinced Wizarding world that Voldemort actually exists and that it's Tom. For some reason Dumbles took baby Harry from Tom & Adrian and gave him to the Potters, under the disguise that he needed a new home because of abuse, gay parents, dark influences and danger from Voldie. I think that Sirius or Severus are actually related but put under a really strong memory spell. When Dumbles attacked the rebels, Adrian was (presumably) killed and baby Harry taken.

If this wonky description rings any bells, i'd be soooooooo thankful for any pointers! I've spent so much time already browsing for this story and just can't seem to get any results...
