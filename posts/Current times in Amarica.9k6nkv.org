I've been considering writing a modern times in America fic. has anyone done this yet? would it be something people would be interested in? thoughts?


** Ignore what Rowling said about America. Her world building barely makes sense in the UK, France and Iberia and already starts to fall apart when you cross into Germany or Italy. Make up your own world instead.

Maybe some purebloods used the Muggle Civil War as a pretence for a power grab and won against the magical Union, even if the South lost the real war. Since the magical one was about power and not slavery, you'd have a bunch of Southern +Malfoys+ Snobs running the country. Or maybe the Canadians took over the magical US. Maybe there is no Union at all, but several nations based on former colonial dominion (Dutch New York, Spanish Florida, French Louisiana, Russian Alaska).

**** Colonising the newfound lands and exploit the natives? Good ol' Imperialism? We are talking about the English here, they basically wrote the handbook on overseas expansion (together with the Spanish).

Alternatively, the "darker" families got fed up by ever increasing regulations on Dark Magic/creation of the Ministry and decided to build their own nation, with +blackjack and hookers+ dark magic and muggle hunting.

That doesn't really make sense for wizards. They don't have much to gain.

****** Gold? Slaves? Trade goods? Lands which can be developed further? Or simply claim a shitton of land as their own (which are the reasons Most European nations expanded overseas).

******* Yeah, muggle European nations. Those needs aren't really applicable to wizards or wouldn't outweigh what they already have. Especially for traditionalists.

******** Slavery was hardly a European invention. It's documented as far back as the first high cultures and the Arabs dominated the slave trade for a long time.

Then I refer you back to my other idea, "I'll make my own Ministry, with +blackjack and hookers+ dark magic and Muggle hunting!"

** Don't try and write to please other people, you will end up hating it. Write the story that you need to. The one that keeps you awake at night and makes you burn the dinner: that one.

*** I haven't had an idea like that in a long time unfortunately. That's part of the reason for writing this story. I figured the best thing to do is to just start writing again and something would come to me.
