** Dudley sat on the couch facing the television, a sandwich of untoasted bread and hard cheese in his hands, a plate to catch the crumbs in his lap. It was his fourteenth birthday, and he had the house to himself---any sensible fourteen-year-old boy would've hosted a party. He had the means to host a party, too---his allowance, though diminutive compared with Harry's, would have afforded him enough crisps and soda to accommodate a dozen people, and of course, Dudley had dozens of /friends/---a privilege of being the cousin of Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived. But it was his cousin Harry, Harry who had the bigger bedroom, Harry who received thirty-nine birthday gifts, Harry who was the sun and moon where Dudley was the soot and ash, who taught him his two most prized traits---aversion towards other people, and being able to find company in his own thoughts. Everyone, from Aunt Marge to his classmates to garrulous shopkeepers, cared for Dudley only insofar as he was related to Harry, like a pot insofar as it carried a plant. Thus, as Dudley sat in front of the television, alone, with a cold sandwich in his hand and his long, messy blonde hair blocking his eyes, he was perfectly content.

The ad break ended, and the daily eight o'clock show---/A Heart-to-Heart with Gilderoy Lockhart/---commenced. The handsome blonde man, in a billowing gold-orange robe, reposed lazily on a luxurious swivel chair.

"Welcome, dear guests, witches and wizards, ladies and gentlemen, esteemed viewers of BBC /Magic/, to another episode of /Heart-to-Heart/." Lockhart paused, giving a contemptible chuckle as his audience laughed with him, "Tonight, your dear host presents to you two special guests --- indeed, a couple, a Princess and her frog, a witch and her warlock --- allow me to introduce to you VERNON and Petunia Dursley, from Little Whinging! Indeed, /the/ Dursleys, the very Dursleys who raised The Boy Who Lived like their own child..."

"Thank you for having us, Mr. Lockhart." Dudley's father extended his fat hand to shake Lockhart's own thin, feminine one.

"I assure you that the pleasure's all mine, Mr. Dursley," Lockhart blurted demurely, "Please, have a seat."

Dudley stared listlessly at the television. He wasn't quite sure why he was watching the show, for he rather detested Lockhart---the man was vain and deeply contrived, Dudley thought, like a mask and an outfit that materialised not over human flesh, but thin air. Perhaps Dudley himself was vain, for there was a small chance that he would be mentioned in one of his parent's interviews. He liked it when the ignorant hosts asked about him; mother would always shift uncomfortably in her seat, and father would describe him perfunctorily, before abruptly changing topic.

"So, Petunia --- may I call you Petunia? I like keeping my relations simple and intimate." Lockhart said with a toothy smile, "You were the old sister of Lily Potter; I imagine it must've been difficult, for both her and yourself likewise, growing up in a muggle household touched by an inkblot of magic. I must ask, what was it like for you, as a muggle, to have a witch for a sister?"

"Well, Gilderoy, I confess that at first, I... I resented Lily," Dudley's mother said in a practiced tone, "How could I not? She was so much better than me --- not just as a witch against a muggle, but she was prettier, kinder, and she naturally spoke with a sort of charm that I couldn't even attain with practice..."

"I appreciate your sincerity, Petunia. I imagine it would've been hard for you indeed --- the bitterness of envy can spring so easily, even among pureblood siblings..."

"Oh, I envied Lily for sure, but you should know that I never truly resented her. Even if she came back every summer with her pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats, my jealousy never turned to hate... no, not until the day she died, at any rate."

Dudley's mother gave a tactful, practised pause, as Lockhart's bright blue eyes turned into two bulbs of glowing surprise.

"Petunia --- what do you mean? Did I hear you right? You hated Lily Potter on the day she died? Surely not..."

"It was her recklessness that angered me! She had a child, a /child/ for Merlin's sake! At the time, I thought that it was the height of --- absurdity --- that she conceived during the midst of a bloody war! Did she have no compassion for poor little Harry?" Dudley's mother gave a long, weary sigh, "Truthfully, Gilderoy, it took me years to overcome my resentment at Lily for leaving little Harry as an orphan in the world... I only forgave her one summer day in 1986, a day I remember as clearly as glass, when I looked into little Harry's eyes, eyes just like Lily's, yes, and realised the truth."

"The truth?" Lockhart asked quizzically, as he leaned forward on his chair.

"She knew that Harry would survive. She was aware of the strength of her own love, and she knew that her love was so strong that /nothing/, not even the Dark Lord, would've been able to hurt Harry." Dudley's mother's voice was so frantic that, if anyone was skeptical, their skepticism would aim at her sanity, rather than her authenticity, "It was then that I loved Lily again --- though I hadn't ever stopped loving her --- it was on that summer day in 1986 that I let go of all my resentment, and welcomed Lily back into my heart. Finally, I had managed to love her in the way she had always loved me."

Dudley switched off the television. He wasn't sure whether or not his mother's story contained a morsel of truth, but he knew that she told it with the exact same emphases on the same words---Harry, eyes, love---whenever she retold it. He knew that she had been on BBC Magic before, and that she had produced the tale many times before, but merely to different hosts. She was good at it, good at being a phony, at making sure her tale wasn't overly sweet---the envious sister become the substitute mother to an abandoned nephew. Surely, all of Britain knew the story of Petunia Dursley, estranged but loving sister to The Redhead Who Died, but they kept falling for it, they kept falling for it.

*** Pardon me, but it remains above my ability of comprehending to even imagine Petunia Dursley exclaim such thing as "Merlin's sake". In all honesty, it's just too rich.

**** I think that's the point - the end implies that it's a heavily practiced speech and that she's just playing to the audience.

** This would be a super cool inversion of the usual stuff, like those dystopias, or the ones where like canon the muggle majority treats mages badly because they are scared of them and stuff (TM). :)
