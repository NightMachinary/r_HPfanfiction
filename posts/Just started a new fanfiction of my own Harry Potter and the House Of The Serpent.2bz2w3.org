** Very early to comment, but you definitely have solid writing skills that made it enjoyable to read, unlike 99.9% of what is out there.

As far as the content, all I have to say is that it was a bit generic - nothing there to really grab me, which separates the "good" from the "great". For a "This is Slytherin Harry and that's all that's different", I might have chosen a different starting point because this one doesn't do much for the reader in terms of excitement, and you may lose some readers because of it.

/In media res/ is an option you might think about, starting with the Slytherin prefect yelling at him to keep up with the group or something, and have him reflect that he couldn't believe he was sorted into Slytherin, and describe the odd look on Ron's face that came up every time Harry glanced at him from across the room (note: I wouldn't villainize Ron like too many Slytherin Harry stories do, just don't have him go out of his way to be friendly like before, have him sometimes brush Harry off a bit or something).

Anyway, tl;dr this is good mechanically but these things tend to be boring unless you make big changes. And don't make the other kids or Dumbledore into caricatures. Be gentle, they're more complex characters than you think they are. Post to Dark Lord Potter's WbA section for more feedback, though it tends to be of the editing sort rather than ideas for revision, as I just provided.

*** Thanks for the advice. I have lots of plans to make it drastically different, but I never gave that much thought to what alternatives I could have for the first year. Most of the major things that'll be completely different and add excitement will be in years 2 and onwards. Not that I'm completely out of ideas for year 1, but I just haven't settled on one.

I guessed my main priority is to have Harry learn how to fit into Slytherin and learn their ways, along with actually giving personality to the (in canon) otherwise empty Slytherin "characters"

And I in no way plan to villanize Ron. Too many fics do that, Slytherin Harry or not. I figured if he never even met him on the train, there wouldn't be all the awkwardness that usually happens when Harry is sorted into Slytherin.

** Getting a beta would be helpful. You need to brush up on some of your dialogue work.

#+begin_quote
  Hagrid turned around with a slightly confused expression on his face "Wha' is it Harry?"
#+end_quote

You need a period after face.

#+begin_quote
  "Thanks Hagrid" Harry said, feeling the momentary....
#+end_quote

You need a comma after Hagrid.

#+begin_quote
  Harry smiled "Don't worry, I will" he said brightly.
#+end_quote

It probably needs a whole rephrase, but there needs to be a comma after *will*.

#+begin_quote
  Draco looked horrified. "They actually told you they died in a CAR CRASH? one of those muggle contraptions? what use would a wizard have for one of those? Unbelievable."
#+end_quote

Technically, you can get away with pretty much anything in dialogue, but *one* and *what* still need to be capitalized.

Don't take this to mean I'm picking on you, but it's these kinds of things that you need to pick up on early so you don't repeat the mistake in the rest of your work. I would make sure the majority of these are cleaned up and just to revisit some of your dialogue work.

Touching on the plot - retelling stories are boring. I saw in one of your comments that you didn't intend to make changes until the second year. Don't wait. Make changes early and often. If you retell the story and just tool around a couple of things, it will be mighty boring and few people will read it. Unless you have a great writing style (which is easier to do in first person POV's), then you have an uphill climb to keep the readers interested. Just some things to think about while you're fleshing out your storyline.

Most importantly, *keep writing*. You will never get better if you stop writing. Hope this was of some help.

*** Thanks! I really liked Hogwarts Battle School, by the way. I do re-read the chapters I have each day for errors, and I think I got all the spacing and spelling, and I was about to work on the periods and commas, but thanks for pointing them out.

And I meant major changes to the plot, as now that I'm done the sorting and the first major thing has changed (sorted into Slytherin) things will be dramatically different then they were in canon.

I realize now that the words I chose were rather foolish, as it won't be a 100% retelling. I was just trying to say the longer the story goes on, the farther reaching the changes that occurred are, and how much more different (and hopefully exciting) the later years will be.

EDIT: I'd never think you're picking on me, I'm always eager for criticism, as long as it's not noiseless complaining and does something constructive and points out actual flaws, as you just did. Thanks for the advice.

**** Not a problem. When you think of your storyline, you need to think along the lines of, "What will make the reader want to read this story?"

Going back in time or Harry-in-Slytherin rewrites have been done ad nauseam. Will it be funny? Will it be dramatc? What is the source of conflict? Why should I read past chapter 3? Basically, you need a hook and Harry-in-Slytherin isn't going to be your hook.

Just some things to ask yourself while you're writing. I find it helps me when I try to think of where this story is going. Ultimately, you're going to want to have a good piece of writing as well as making it interesting to the reader. If no one reads, it kills the will to write

***** Kwan is absolutely right here - he says "why read past chapter 3" but I say start earlier - right from the start make it clear that this is /not/ the same old shit. I mentioned earlier - if you're retelling for no reason, start at a different place. Make the Hogwarts Express scene your own, make it different and fun and specific to the Harry that you're trying to request.

One of the pieces of advice from Jim Butcher on how to write is this: Make every scene count. If you don't have a purpose for the scene, don't put it in the story. If you read any of my work, I think that's the biggest change I tried to implement from my earlier stuff to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4815342/1/Escape-to-Darkness][Escape to Darkness]], my most recent story.

Scenes that need to be there, put them in. Otherwise, use them as background later - You don't need the troll to solidify the friendship with Harry/Hermione/Ron? Don't put it in, just reference it later. "At least Quirrell didn't let in a troll this feast. Honestly, could a Defense teacher be more useless?" And so forth.

****** Thanks, this is all really wonderful advice. I'll do my best to incorporate it all. I honestly hadn't given thought to NOT doing every major event in the book, I just figured I'd have to do it all but slightly modified.

Not to say I didn't think about glossing over certain events and referencing it later, but it's hard, because so many things in PH were crucial in establishing key things.

Snape's relationship with Harry, Harry discovering his flying talent, his first lessons, etc. It'd be kind of hard to just say "oh, by the way, I answered Snape's questions correctly so he doesn't hate me."

But I know what you meant.

******* You have to have a reason for it, is all I'm saying. No one wants to read the same potions lesson Harry had as a Gryffindor, but with him in a green tie instead of a red one - we've already read it.

Snape has to have an angle you're trying to illustrate. He's seen Harry get close to Hermione, that uppity mudblood Gryffindor - knock her down a notch. There's a common theme in the fandom that "Slytherins stick together" but Snape can damn well be sure to punish anyone that dares befriend Harry in other subtle ways.

Show THAT in the class - berate Hermione for being a know-it-all and insufferable and secretly getting answers from Harry because she's a useless mudblood who doesn't know her place and couldn't possibly answer. All while staring straight in the eyes of Harry.

It's a scene I'd read, for what it's worth.

******** I was thinking of doing something very similar to that, in fact. I long ago decided she'd be his only non Slytherin friend. At first I was thinking Ron as well, but Hermione IMO was a more loyal friend in canon and I imagine Ron would have a hard time making friends with a Slytherin when he's 11 and immature. Or at least Hermione wouldn't be as prejudiced. Him being friends with a Gryffindor, let alone a muggleborn could lead to lots of conflict.

**** A lot of is preference and any well written story can still hold the same storyline as Scenario A (which I will refer to as the storyline where the endings remain canon). Regardless, I think Scenario B (entirely different plot) is the stronger option.

For Scenario A, there are plenty of fics that go that route and have very competent stories. Even things like viewing canon from a different perspective can make for a compelling story. The struggle is to maintain the suspense and surprise (given that the readers know how it ends) and balance it with telling your own story. I think most writers struggle in this regard. The motivations of the characters and the plot don't always mesh well with canon endings. If you were to go with Scenario A, I would argue for it in that it's a good way to show different perspectives and the tantalizing "what if..." scenario.

But I would caution that, many times, Scenario A is boring once the readers cotton onto the fact that it ends the same. Characters are important, but only excellent writing will keep the reader interested if they already know the ending.

For Scenario B, I think the possibilities are endless. I would almost always recommend authors write with Scenario B in mind. These are your characters. They will act differently than what JKR wrote. The endings will be different. You can create your own suspenseful plot without being constricted by canon endings. The downside, if there is one, is that it can be difficult to stay within the confines of the story and your world. But that isn't really any different than any non-canon story. You have to construct your own plot and make sure it can stand on its own, but I think, ultimately, it is the better option if you were to write a retelling story with a point of convergence early on (Harry goes to Slytherin).

For all cases, AGE UP YOUR CHARACTERS. It is difficult to write believable eleven year olds. Your natural instinct is to have them be intelligent and badass, but it usually feels hollow. If you want to start in media res in Fourth Year, go ahead. You can explain the back story as it goes along.

*tl;dr - If you keep canon endings, the story has the pitfall of feeling like retread ground, but the familiarity can create unique perspective opportunities. If you have an entirely different plot, you have to construct a lot more, but you have the ability to write your own suspenseful story*

** I think the suggestions here of doing /in media res/ are on the right track. I can't say I'm interested in reading year one of this story as is. Why would I? Maybe you can find something to pull people in for the first bit. But find something. Any reason to avoid the vast majority of mediocre, multiple-novel length, AU fanfics' years 1-3, stations-of-the-cross renditions that eat up the first hundred thousand words, and the last of the author's enthusiasm.

Single change fics are great. I love them. I do not love rewritten, slightly-changed-POV fics. I'm sure some people do. I want to read something new. Preferably, totally new.

If I ever ran into a story where Slytherin Harry's first year was only a handful of satisfying paragraphs long, I would be ecstatic and instantly scroll back up to favorite it. I'm not joking.

It would be like this (assume the usual slightly-different, and /short/, trip up and sorting into a green tie):

#+begin_quote
  Defense class started boring and incomprehensible and only got worse. Harry expected better, especially after his first Potions class, but Hogwarts seemed to be all about low, or at least random, teaching standards. Compared to his previous school experience, that was saying something.

  Malfoy wouldn't shut up about not being allowed to attend some Dark-Arts-happy Baltic school, Doom-something. He wasn't allowed because his father was on the board at Hogwarts, and that would be just too embarrassing for the family. Harry wept no tears at his least-favorite roommate's troubles, and wondered if the little turd realized the condition of Hogwarts reflected, at least partially, on his dad. What an idiot.

  The rest of the classes were fairly informative (even the one minus a warm, breathing teacher). There was what basically amounted to gardening (too easy) and skywatching (an excuse to stay up late and relax). Charms was fun and funny, and Transfigurations was worth all the time under the gimlet eye of the scariest women he'd ever met. She always seemed to be staring at him, for some reason. Even during meals.

  Otherwise, the adults all appeared to ignore the children outside of class or the very occasional drive-by punishing of minor infringements in the halls. No one-on-one instruction or office hours -- except maybe for Malfoy. Other, older children were tasked with keeping the peace and informing on their fellow students. Harry had only seen Professor Snape, the most hands-on of his teachers, once in the Slytherin common room at the beginning of term. The other teachers were even more distant. They didn't even notice that poor, loud little mouse amongst the Lions who kept getting harassed by her own House, until she went missing and was half-killed by a troll on Halloween night.

  That had been the anniversary of the night Harry's parents were killed, Malfoy kept pointing out the week after the useless Defense professor's failure to do his job almost cost a girl her life. And maybe Harry was next, the ponce had suggested, adding that trolls prefered the taste of Muggle, so Harry should watch out he wasn't half-eaten himself. Harry then tripped Malfoy into a suit of armor and received his third detention for fighting in the halls.

  Rumors were, the girl, Hermione, was Muggle-born, obnoxiously smart, and her Muggle parents had almost pulled her from the school entirely. No solid information on why they didn't. Maybe she loved magic as much as Harry did, and had thrown a fit. Despite everything, he'd have done the same. She had quietly showed up in class again a week later with half her face bandaged up, a limp, and a scary look in her remaining eye. Maybe Professor McGonagall had some competition brewing on that front.

  Harry ignored most of his House mate's idiotic talk. Hermione was a witch, and that was all that mattered. Harry's mom had been Muggle-born and a powerful and skilled witch, after all, and having that lace-trimmed pounce constantly saying nasty things about anyone not provably "pure" rubbed him the wrong way. And reminded him of dark things from his Muggle school's history classes: cloth stars, ID tattoos, and boxcar trains. They way she'd levitated a fellow student's bookbag in front of him when that bludger went rogue and chased him around the stands during the Slytherin-Gryffindor game certainly proved she knew her stuff. Slytherin had caught the Snitch seconds later and won, so it wasn't like she'd interfered with the game or anything. Malfoy didn't see it that way, of course.

  Clearly obsessed, he'd somehow gotten her in trouble after the winter break, and she'd ended up spending a very scary and very late detention in the Forbidden Forest with Mr. Hagrid. That was the same week the poor man's cottage had burned down. The whole thing was odd and shrouded in rumor and mystery, which seemed to be the natural habitat for Gryffindors. But between a rampaging troll, possible arson, dragons (/really/ Malfoy?), and nighttime trips to find dead unicorns in a dangerous magical forest, maybe it was best that Harry was in Slytherin. Seemed like the safer choice, despite his annoying fellow First Years. Harry wouldn't have survived that sort of nonsense without something like a magic ring of invisibility, and those sorts of things seemed thin on the ground in real life, even for Gryffindors. Slytherin students like Harry had their own worries though, more political and personal ones.

  Luckily, Harry's Head of House seemed willing to remain neutral. He clearly favored Malfoy in class -- the honey-mouthed little git was always perfect around the Professor -- but he didn't take sides at least. And sometimes, he looked at Harry oddly. But then, he looked at most of his students oddly, so maybe it was nothing. Harry's scores in his class were, of course, just about perfect, so it wasn't that. Nothing less was acceptable, according to Professor Snape, if Harry wanted to be allowed the chance to try out next year for the Seeker position. Malfoy immediately said /he/ was going to be Seeker, and had started in about how he would write his father, but the Professor had told them it was up to the Captain and they'd both have to go to tryouts. Tough, but fair. Malfoy wasn't half the rider Harry was, though.

  The last week of classes, "Professor" Quirrell disappeared. Maybe that huge, three-headed dog the older students had all snuck in to see had eaten the foul-smelling mumbler. Good riddance. Harry's scar had stopped hurting around that time, so maybe he was allergic to the man's garlic aftershave. Whatever. Another year of that and Harry would have offed the man himself, with the cheerful help of half the school -- other teachers included.

  Slytherin won the House and the Quidditch cup, of course. The train ride home was nice, and Harry's pockets were full of supposedly legal magical devices to frigh- err, show off to his oh-so-loving and helpfully excused from the Statue of Secrecy Muggle relatives. He really owed Nott and Greengrass, even though he technically paid dearly in gold for every item. It was going to be the best summer yet.
#+end_quote

There. Something like that.

Year two would be full detail, where you'd get to know his new friends he'd met over the last year. New things would happen, like Harry being in Slytherin when the monster showed up. Or maybe, if you're smart, when something totally different happens, because Malfoy the Elder has a new plan.

Just please. No scene for scene rehashing, or even more detailed droning on about his new mates, his Quidditch games, and his clearly much more exciting relationship with Snape. It burns.

*** I'll keep that in mind. I was planning something like that, now that I've received the advice. Like I said, I had lots of decided upon ideas for the later years, but very few for the first. If the first isn't going to be very eventful, make it a basic glossary or major events briefly referencing what changed. For the first year, at least.

I really appreciate all the advice I've gotten from all of you guys, such talented writers. I've favourited your favourite stories list, for example, and plan on reading Harry Potter and the Witch Queen once I'm finished "Oh no, not again!"

Basically, I really appreciate help from anybody, let alone people who's writing power I respected before you even offered advice.
