I remember reading this one fanfic some time ago, and ever since I've been trying to find it again. I've looked myself on every site I can think of, and done the found in a few and no one can ins it, so I'd figure I'd ask all of you. (Sorry if the plot summary sounds incoherent, it's been over a year since I last saw this)

The story started after Voldemort had been defeated, and Harry was going back to the Dursleys. Dumbledore was still alive so I'd assume it was pre HBP.

When arriving at the Dursleys, he finds Dumbledore there with his parents, and with 'Harry Potter'.

Apparently, they all went into hiding, and Lily set about creating fake versions of themselves to take their places. I forget what they were called specifically in the story,

Informing the main character, who Is apparently not Harry as we were lead to believe, is told that they will probably degrade back into magic or something as the enchantment is wearing off.

However, after leaving the house to await their fate, the fake Harry reverts to the body of a teenage girl. It is revealed that to make this ruse more believable, Lily kidnapped Regulus Black, his wife, and their daughter, and preformed a different spell to mask them as the Potters, and it was they who died that night.

I don't remember too much after that point, but I do know that the 'real' Harry was a spoilt brat, and loved basking in the unearned fame. I also remember him hitting on the girl main character (Sorry, her name eludes me), as she has kept it a secret that she 'was' Harry and survived after she was supposed to die. I also know she returns to society as the Black heiress.

Sorry, it's not a lot to go off of, but it's been a long time and the details are getting harder to remember, though I do know the above is accurate.

Thanks ahead of time for even bothering to help look, - Zoey


** At first I thought you were talking about [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4641394/1/The-Substitute][The Substitute.]]

It has some common elements, but it's definitely not it. Great story though.

*** Yeah, that's definitely not it, though after reading the first chapter I think it's interesting enough finish.

Thanks for trying though. With all the searching I've put into finding this Fic, I'm starting to think the author removed it. Mostly just hoping to be proven wrong at this point, since it was one of my favorites.

**** The Substitute is definitely a very engrossing read.

I feel your pain though. I was looking for a particular story for /years/ until someone on [[http://forums.fictionalley.org/park/forumdisplay.php?s=&forumid=19][FictionAlley]] knew about it and linked it.

I would try there, you never know!
