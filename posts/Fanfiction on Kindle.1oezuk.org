Hey guys, i found a program that converts fanfiction stories to .mobi file types, which can then be placed in the 'documents' folder of your kindle. [[http://fanfictiondownloader.net/]] I ran a virus check and it came up clean so no worries :) the website has a step-by-step for putting them onto the kindle, if anyone gets stuck


** I usually use [[http://flagfic.com][flagfic]] you can download the fanfiction in different formats, including .mobi!

*** they've recently ran into an issue with fanfiction.net they are getting blocked by their servers. I've talked with the guy and he said he's tried a lot to get around it, but given the number of requests, they find it fast and block him

** archiveofourown.org has a download function on each story, and several formats are offered.

Calibre, which works with Kindle and many other devices as well as PCs, will download FF with a link (most sites) , convert them to the best format and then download updates when you login! This takes a special add-on, but it's all free!

** Kindles can open PDF files too, so you can get them off fanfiction.net in that form.
