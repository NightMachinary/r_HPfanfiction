I have been reading a couple fanfics lately that were written before the HP series was finished, but somehow predict a plot point or development that comes out in later books. What are your favorite examples of this?


** I once read a oneshot on ffn from when the last book was ootp which took the events we saw in Snape's Worst Memory and ran with it, and ended up making the following conclusions.

Lily standing up in defense of Snape? Clearly they had a history. Snape obviously had an unrequited love for her, and while it was never mutual, it was enough for him to care for her later on.

Snape is a spy for the Order [established fact at OotP's time]. This only makes sense from Voldemort's point of view if he either started as a spy for the other side, or infiltrated the Death Eaters on Dumbledore's orders.

So what the fic did was to have a bunch of short scenes, as follows:

- Snape reveals his feelings for Lily. She is flattered but doesn't feel the same way (iirc they were good study partners, but didn't have the close friendship they had in later revealed canon).
- Snape's Worst Memory
- Snape joins the Death Eaters
- Snape overhears part of the prophecy and reveals it to Voldemort
- Once it's clear that Voldemort is targeting the Potters, he goes to Dumbledore. In his office it's clear that he begged Voldemort to spare the parents (not just Lily!). I don't remember his motivations for James, but iirc it was something like him telling Voldemort that he wanted to take Lily in front of James. The reason Lily didn't become the Woman who Lived is because James actively defended himself, forcing Voldemort's hand.
- Ultimately he switches sides at this point in time, and is the Order's spy from that point
- Lily dies, and Snape vows to protect Harry in her memory.

While the fic has minor differences from actual canon, it pretty much nailed Snape's backstory completely. Unfortunately I was never able to find the oneshot again.

** There is absolutely no possible way to find the fic(s) involved, but several predicted Harry was a horcrux. Only the be eviscerated in the reviews because book one showed that harry's mere /touch/ was enough to destroy voldemort's host, so there's no way he could be one...

** /Betrayal of the Best Kind/, by Draco664, written before OotP; the DADA teacher is a Ministry worker, evil (although as a secret Death Eater), Fudge spends a year denying Voldy's return. Sequel, /Midnight Duel, Midday Love/ (started before OotP, finished a short time afterwards); Peter helps Harry at a critical point, gets killed by the prosthetic.

** I once read one that was started before half blood prince was published, and it was about Hermione, Draco, Ron, Lavender, Harry and Ginny accidentally traveling to Riddle's last year. Ron and Lavender ended up getting together. It's minor, but still funny

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2818538/1/The-Seventh-Horcrux][The Seventh Horcrux]] is written prior book 7 and predicts quite a few things from DH:

- The attack at the wedding and the guests taking refuge at the Grimauld Place;
- The Ministry take over by the Death Eaters and making Harry a wanted man;
- spoiler Remus and Tonks die protecting Harry (quite a massive spoiler if you want to read it);
- The locket (although that should have been quite obvious) at the Black House and the tiara in the Room of Requirements being Slytherin's and Ravenclaw's horcruxes respectively;
- Harry being the final Horcrux and using the Golden Snitch to help get rid of it (although quite in a different way than in the book);
- Harry travelling (I don't remember if immediately after or before the final battle) to the land of the dead where he meets the Maraurders and Dumbledore;
- Also Snape cared enough about Lily to warn the Potters to go into hiding but it's not a major plot point, and definitely not to the level he does in actual books.
