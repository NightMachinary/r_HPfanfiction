I'm looking for a long fic, but will read anything you give me. Preferably including hijinks and lots of fluff. I just finished reading [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10870578][The Cat Came Back]]. I would love something like that but continuing throughout Harry's life. Thanks!


** I'm in the process of writing a fic like this, but I'm only at about 29k words so far (rewriting the series one book at a time). The first installment is called [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20521760/chapters/48706316][What's a soldier, but a lover, who's life drew the wrong hand]]

** Here's the oldest (perhaps even first?) one! From 2004.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1257566/1/A-Tabby-and-Her-Kit]]

/Minerva stubbornly defies Dumbledore's command and rescues baby Harry Potter from his uncaring relatives. How will she handle raising him without the help of Hogwarts? REFORMATTED bask in the italics!/

It features weird things like an AD/MM pairing (Dumbledore wasn't gay back then) and Harry as an actual child. I remember it fondly, though it might have not aged well.

I have a feeling there was a long fic but I don't know if I can remember the title...it's on ffnet I think... let me see if I can dig it up or if I'm getting mixed up with the Presbyterian Witch

ok so here it is, but I haven't read it yet so, good luck ffnet(11200794)

**** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11200794]] Here you are! I'm about 5 chapters in, and it's not got the best writing style so far, but writers grow a lot over a story, and it's been recently updated, so I'm gonna stick with it.
