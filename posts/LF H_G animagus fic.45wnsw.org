Not sure if I've come across a good one of these before. Preferably novel length in later Hogwarts years.


** "Growing Up Kneazle" and its sequel might fit your bill, though it starts before first year. Very nice relationship building over the years, with good characterisation, no bashing, and a lot of Humor.

  Growing up as a Kneazle is tricky, especially when you realize you might be human, too. Add in posessed professors, sinister snakes, and more detentions than he can count, and Harry's Hogwarts career has certainly been memorable. What will he do when he faces his biggest challenge yet? Being a teenager isn't easy no matter what species you are. Sequel to 'Growing Up Kneazle'
