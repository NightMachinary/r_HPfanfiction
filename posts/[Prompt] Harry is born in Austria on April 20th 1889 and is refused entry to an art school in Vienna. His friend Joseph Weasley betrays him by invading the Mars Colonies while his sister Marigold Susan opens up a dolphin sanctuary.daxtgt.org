** "Nein!" shouted Harry. "The Muggleborns shall not replace us!"

...

"Mua ha ha," said Joseph. "Yes, Harry, I am invading Mars. My sister, Stephanie Isaak Weasley, has been dosing you with love potion in your water to keep you ignorant of the true nature of the world! Soon, Mars will be mine!"

...

Marigold Susan flattered her eyebrows. "Why, Harry darlin'" she said, "Without Christianity, Dolphins have no where to go. That's why ah'm building a dolphins sancturary here South Sudan, a good Christian nation, to save the word of the lord in this heathen land."

Harry cried tears of passion, for his beautiful siste'r's cause was righteous.

...

Director Grindelwald frowned. "Your composition is horrible Mr. Potter. I must reject you from this art school instead. Perhaps you should try architecture instead?"

Delphini flashed Harry. "Maybe you should go into politics. You've certainly got the temperment for it."

...

"Mua ha ha," said Dumbledore. "Soon Joseph and I shall be Lords of Mars!"

Ginny kissed Albus.

"Wait, who's Ginny?" said Dumbledore. "I thought we established that--"

...

"Oh yes, the Dolphins," said Marigold Susan. "We Potters were Dolphin Tamers back in ancient Greece, you know."
