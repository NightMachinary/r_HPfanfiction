** I prefer "S.S. SSSsssssss", but then again those sort of ship names fell out of use at least a decade ago.

I think most people don't use that sort of shorthand for HP/LV or HP/TMR pairings, however I can say I've seen it referred to as Pottermort whereas, like mergirl said, Harrymort is more like Ginnymort/Riddlebottom and refers to a fusing of the souls.

**** Sorry, I have no clue. Those stories aren't very common to begin with (don't know why, it's a great setup for OP Harry), and I don't think there's a common fanon term for that trope. Actually, I'm not certain people will actually use "Harrymort" in fic if they're talking about the fusion of Harry and his horcrux. It's definitely used in discussions and maybe in ANs, but never in the fic itself, since it's not really narratively appropriate.

I guess the best way to find these stories is to do what this sub does best: ask for recs. :P

**** Well, if you do not mind having to shovel some much before you get anything of worth, you might want to take a look at FFN's HP communities; there just might be one with stories of this kind. I would have given you a link instead of just saying “go look” but the last few times I'd actually delved into that I'd only been paying attention to specific things so I didn't notice anything and that doesn't mean anything.

Other than that, if you know any stories that have this kind of stuff that are on AO3, you can use that to go on a tag mining trip (or you can do that blind, assuming you have some horror protection pills).

That said, I know of three stories with this kind of thing. One is “Seventh Horcrux”, which you've obviously read because everyone has, the second is “At the Hands of the Other” (knowledge, but not possession), which you've probably read as well, and the last one is “Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality” (possession, but not knowledge) which, read or not, you are most likely aware of and already have an opinion about so I'm only mentioning it for the sake of completion.

linkffn(9911469), Lily and the Art of being Sisyphus, has an active horcrux, iirc. Same goes for linkffn(6163339), "Harry Potter and the Descent into Darkness", which is slash.

linkffn(9720211), The Merging, kind of has what you want, but it's pretty gradual.
