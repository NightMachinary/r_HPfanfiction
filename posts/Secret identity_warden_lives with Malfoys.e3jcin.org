:END:
Dunno what it's mainly about but remember liking it. Couple of scenes is all I can remember happening. Harry is hiding his identity (maybe time travel, maybe not though) and runs into Lucius Malfoy at flourish and blotts and convinces him that muggleborns come from squibs or something like that, he also ends up living with them where they find out his identity erm and I think he does wards maybe?

** It kinda reminded me of this one: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17818757]] I could be wrong though.

  Harry finds himself making a decision to give it all up just to change what has happened. What he doesn't realize is that he gets a second chance to set it right.
