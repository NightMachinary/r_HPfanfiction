Looking For - Alright, I have been looking for like 3 days and I give up so I am hoping someone here can piece together my memories. I read this a few years ago and thought of it the other day and really want to read it again. So, basically Harry joins the aurors and ends up working on some case with vanishing rugs sold by some random Persian(?) guy and then end up goeing to France with some French Auror and there are magic rings with him and Ginny. The tapestry in the old Black house has some other additional magic properties similar to Mrs. Weasley's clock. They end up finding a death eater hid out under an archaeology site and watching people cursed fly in and out on more magic rugs. Dudley is a muggle cop I think. idk. I just cant find it. Help Please.

*** Cha! I know this one. And yes, it is tricky, because it is neither on FF.net nor AO3. It is [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=260207][Harry Potter and the Winters After the War by Mrs_Granger]], which is a sequel to [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=245803][Harry Potter and the Summer After the War by Mrs_Granger]] (actually, that and only that is available on FF.net as linkffn(11593633)). Both of them are excellent stories, one of the best in the “What happened after the War” type. Highly recommended.
