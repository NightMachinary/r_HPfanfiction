** It's short for "independent Harry" and is used as a convenient shorthand for the plethora of (usually) bad and (usually) trope-tastic fics where Harry has Had Enough^{TM} of whatever bullshit /du jour/ is appropriate for his current position in the canon timeline. Particularly common cliches include:

- Friendly goblins, borne from surprise that he is polite to them and/or recognizes Griphook from his first cart ride.
- Blood-based tests and rituals that can perfectly divine ancestry, hidden powers, and any blockers on said powers.
- Multiple lordships, e.g. he is now Harry Potter-Black-Gryffindor-Slytherin-Peverell. Bonus points for "Harry" being a nickname and his real name being Harold or something similarly posh. Triple word score for long-forgotten marriage contracts (plural) and more money than some countries' GDP.
- Needlessly detailed shopping sprees where he gets acromantula silk robes, a new trunk with multiple magically expanded compartments, and a new wand that features some sort of super special wood/core combination. Of these, only the trunk is likely to be mentioned again in any significant way.
- Dumbledore, and potentially the Weasleys and/or Hermione, turns out to have been lying to or stealing from Harry this entire time. Expect a public calling-out in the great hall or similar venue.

*** My contain faint amounts of (bad) political intrigue, Slytherins are the real heroes^{TM}, Love Potions are harmless fun except when used against "the last scion of a noble and ancient family", nobody managed to fully destroy Dumbledore's power base and reputation until teenagers came along, treating goblins with respect will make them break any oaths and/or contracts they may have made.

Also, a bit of angst and an harem I guess, and suddenly Potter is perfect and every girls in Hogwarts wants his ... powerbase.

*** Lol worst on I read was 'King of Magic', it had a classic indy!Harry story description so I wasn't going to take it too seriously. But, holy. Shit. Let me just say it was worse then I could have ever imagined. The writing was far from great, but the plot was even worse. They spent /at least/ 4k words on the /list of titles and shit Harry inherited/. To show you how /bad/ this was, let me give you three words:

/"House of Washington"/

I couldn't stop laughing at the ridiculousness and closed out on the first chapter. If you want something so bad it's funny, there you go.

** It's a trope that blew up after the release of Order of the Phoenix. Post-OotP fics were and are still very popular to write and read because of how Harry's entire world shifted. He was moody and angry all through the book, the wizarding society as a whole was mocking and ostracizing him, people in power were trying to beat him down, Voldemort was back and no one was doing anything to stop him, Dumbledore was ignoring him, and to top it all off, Sirius was dead (partly because of him, partly because of Kreacher and Snape, partly because of Dumbledore keeping secrets). You can see why, at the end of all this, it's so easy to write a fanfic.

Harry had just gone through a lot of trauma, he's essentially a blank slate at this point. No one can accuse you of writing him out-of-character because having a character drastically change after all that is a completely valid excuse. And it's also valid that Harry would want to step away from the wizarding world and Dumbledore after their actions -- and readers were also pissed off at how Harry was treated in OotP, even if they found him whiny.

So people started writing about a Harry that pulled away from everyone to do his own thing. This meant training on his own, learning new spells and how to fight without the help of Dumbledore. One of the first fics, if not the first, to do this was HP and the Power of Time by RossWrock linkffn(1657629). Even if he wasn't the originator of some of the ideas in indy!Harry fics, he was the one that made them popular. The Diagon Alley shopping spree, the multi-compartment trunk that had compartments large enough to train and live in, etc.

At the most basic, an indy!Harry fic is a post-OotP fic that has Harry decide to learn things on his own and take the battle to Voldemort on his own without the help of Dumbledore or the others. Sometimes Ron and Hermione are part of it, sometimes not.

  Now AU, 6th Year, following OoTP. Tired of the way Dumbledore and the Order treat him, and ready to face his destiny, Harry dedicates long hours to muggle and magical training to take the fight to Voldemort for a change. Slight HPGW, not shippy though.
