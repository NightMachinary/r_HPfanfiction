Hello. I'm new to the HP Fanfiction Reddit site, but I usually look at what fans are talking about every couple of days. I actually had a request on when would be the best time to post a one-shot on Fanfiction. I have a story that's currently in-progress but would like to post a plot bunny that expanded a bit. Does anyone know if some days of the week are more popular than others (i.e. It seems, to me at least, on the weekend, Fanfiction doesn't create much foot-traffic. I usually post the chapters of my story during the week, with twice being on the weekend, and realized more views were recorded during the actual week - Tuesday captured the most views). Not that it matters, but my story and one-shot is of a Charlie-Hermione pairing. Thanks!


** According to the Archive of Our Own status page, the weekends are the busiest time for posting. FFN is probably the same. Therefore, I would say it's best to post during the week, because your fic will take longer to get buried. Most readers are always reading!
