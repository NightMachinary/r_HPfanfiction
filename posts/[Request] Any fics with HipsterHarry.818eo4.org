** Im actually bouncing around a plot bunny of Harry being turned from pre-war conventionality to post-war maturity and exploration, which leads to getting inspired by Tonks and her surviving friends into seeing the underground art and music scene of London, where Tonks got her 90s industrial aesthetics from.

Where I come from in Middle Europe, this haircut is primarily seen on either left-leaning or politically indifferent people.

**** A lot of men on the Alt-right have started getting this haircut, at least in the U.S. So it's kinda been adopted by many as the most common haircut for white nationalists and members of the Alt-right.

***** Honestly at this point to I might be mixing up fanon with Canon, but I seem to remember Harry having no friends at all in the muggle world because they all either believe the Dursley's lies about him, in the adults case, or allowed his abuse to continue by completely ignoring him to save themselves from Dudley's abuse, in the children's case. He didn't receive any positive treatment when living as a muggle so I could see why his vendetta against them might be more justified than, say, Draco Malfoy.
