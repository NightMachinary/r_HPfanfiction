I'm looking for fics in the Harry goes back in time to fix shit, but he doesn't turn into some OP superhero. Every one of these I've read so far, he's so OP, never makes a mistake, and then lambasts/bashes people for pages and pages for what they did in the normal timeline.

I've read tons of Hermione goes back and either can't fix things or can and still makes mistakes. So I'd like to read a Harry like that too. There are a million choices a character can make in any situation, it's so unrealistic to think that even with prior knowledge Harry would be able to make the correct decision 100% of the time.

So, have any of you found a fic like this?


** I think it's meh/okay but it's exactly what you're asking for, so here: linkffn(4061219)

Harry and Hermione both go back in time but Harry comes back the summer before his first year while Hermione comes back one month after it started. While waiting for her, Harry (SPOILER) while he (SPOILER). So they beat Voldemort without any problems thanks to knowing the future, but they still end up having to fight another Dark Lord that's even worse because Harry fucked up.

I would recommend you give each of the story a chance and read through it.. The last one has some bashing and but don't leave it. I hate bashing and found it to be overall a really pleasant read.

This one is mostly told from Hermione's perspective. The Harry in this is messed up. He was really strong in the future, coming back he lost most of his strength but had the knowledge. It mostly focuses on character interaction which makes it better IMO. Give it a try.

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.

  When the most powerful magics collide due to Harry Potter's desperate, last sacrifice, he creates for himself a chance to fix up the wrongs in his world. Yet going back in time isn't everything that he expected: Voldemort is a threat, but it is Harry himself who no longer fits comfortably in the world. Time has changed him, he just hasn't yet figured out how.

**** I would recommend you start with The many deaths of Harry Potter.

One of the best takes on time travel I have seen. The Harry featured could be considered innately even weaker than Canon Harry as Canon Harry was able to perform a few spells on his first try, but this Harry; nope. This is actually used by Horcrux to manipulate him at one point.

Anyway enjoy.

** Hey I forgot to link this one when I commented earlier. I loved this fic. Harry is MOD but not OP. It is extremely well written and pays a lot of attention on the particulars of the era. It is going to be slash but there is no romance yet. It is only updated on ao3 though.
