It's the most reliable way to get the right fic out of the bot, tied with plugging the full URL into the command. Whatever number comes after /s/ (for fanfiction.net links) or /works/ (for ArchiveOfOurOwn links) is the story ID, plug that into the bot command and it'll pretty much always find it unless the bot is just broken.

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.
