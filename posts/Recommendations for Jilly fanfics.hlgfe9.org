Preferably +30k words and complete, but if it's not abandoned it's good enough for me. Wolfstar, not Wolfstar, I don't really mind either. I would like if it would be during their last year at Hogwarts or during the war. AU where they aren't dead/they come back through the veil are also welcome.


** For jily as the main focus, there's linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5791522/chapters/13348279]]) linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10840977/chapters/24066027]]) linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12968535/chapters/36387036]]) It's been a while since I've read these, the first is finished and the other two aren't. They're well-written, good characterization, good plot that could be canon compliant, and feel a bit like an American rom-com meets Hogwarts.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16281977/chapters/38077013]]) just began updating again, now it's just missing the last chapter. It's more wolfstar than jily, but Lily especially is extremely well-written and both romances get plenty of screen time. It could be canon compliant, except that the tri-wizard tournament happens in their seventh year.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16417496/chapters/38435513]]) This is an AU of 1979 with lots more going on than jily, lots of story lines and gets really exciting after a few slow introductory chapters. Complete.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5986366/chapters/13756558]]) This one has a few great chapters of jily interaction although they're really not the main focus. I included it since you mentioned AUs. Basically a Harry timetravel, but unusually well-done. Not finished by a long shot, but it updates every few months with several new chapters.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13281801/chapters/30392982]]) I'll include this as well in case you haven't read it yet. Does have some great jily interaction with baby Harry, although the focus is trust and who the traitor in the Order is. AU, only 25k, complete.

  There's just something about James Potter that always causes Lily to make the worst decisions. That's probably how she ends up throwing away a month of her seventh year on a bet with a boy she can hardly stand. A story of growing up, identity, and falling in love.

  Magic was supposed to be whimsical, enchanting, fun. But it's 1975 and the self-proclaimed Dark Lord has other plans. Dark Marks are graffiti'ed across the sky as a warning, a threat. Hogwarts students try to focus on their schooling, their friends, and being a child while they can. But some of their parents remember Grindelwald and they recognize the signs. With fellow students practicing dark magic and friendships being tested, it's hard to ignore that their parents' war will soon be theirs. And yet, they still try, forcing light in the darkness and daring to laugh when others want to cry. After all, they aren't dead yet, and there's few things that would irritate the Dark Lord more than a bunch of blood traitors and muggleborns thriving in the face of his power. This is the story of those blood traitors, those half-bloods, those muggleborns, growing up and up to no good.

  While war brews on the horizon beyond the walls of Hogwarts, the infamous Triwizard Tournament resurfaces just in time for the Marauders' seventh year. It's one more reason for Remus Lupin to pull out his hair and prematurely wrinkle. And another reason? It walks, talks (too much), and chews up Remus' belongings while in dog form.

  James is having the time of his life, Bellatrix enjoys a spot of nail-pulling, Marlene is an excellent dancer, Dorcas gets the job done, Remus finds a purpose in life that doesn't revolve around his werewolf alter ego, Sirius should perhaps try out a healthier lifestyle, Lily brews the best Polyjuice Potion, Alastor keeps an eye on things, Mary is scared for a reason, Gideon would probably be scared without one, Regulus can't wait to do the right thing once he figures out just exactly what that is and Peter had a great time in school. The question is, where is Voldemort's soul and is it safe to go looking for it?This is a self-indulgent take on the first wizarding war with canon divergence from chapter 25. The story is told from several points of view in a would-be attempt to scrape the surface on each character's psychology. There are mature themes throughout the story, but most chapters are supposed to be more humour than angst.

  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. “It's a really long story,” he says finally, almost apologetically, “and it's really hard to believe.”“Try me,” Regulus says, more than a little daringly.

  Moments. They make or break relationships. Lily didn't just happen to fall in love with James. It wasn't an accident, but a long drawn out process that grew out of the relationships of the people around them. And when it came down to it, even Lily and James couldn't fight fate.
