After browsing [[/r/ImaginaryLeviathans/]] I want to read a fic with a huge monster that needs defeating or just the mystery of slowly learning about it until it appears as it destroys everything. Essentially Lovecraft inspired fics. I've read most of Worm which I know has Endbringers so it could be inspired by that too.

  Every seventy years members of the Order of the Bath, a British order of chivalry, are being killed off. That is until Harry is brought in to hunt the killer or killers down. Harry/Padma. *Complete*

** I have an idea for a lovecraft crossover where harry and friends must battle the denizens of the sunken city when it is raised when some idiots in the ministry thought it was Atlantis due to. Cultists influencing them. The raising awakens the sleepers, leading to the destruction of the statute as eldritch abominations destroy new york, la, london, and so on.

  Harry Potter never did have the best luck with holidays. How do you even begin to fight a creature the size of a large building? Harry Potter vs Trespasser.

*** not sure why ur downvoted pretty much the 80% of the fic is the main character taking on massive/legendary monsters that are above his level but he perseveres due to luck/tactics/skills.
