I once read this fic in which Blaise Zabini runs into the disappeared Harry Potter in Africa as a tour guide in the forests. He had built a new life there where no one knew how he looked.


** Is it “The Horror, The Horror!” By DisobedienceWriter? Otherwise, perhaps google Harry Potter Africa FanFiction

*** I'm afraid not, thanks though. I tried that already, couldn't find it, I was hoping someone here might be familiar with it. If nothing works then I'll try bruteforcing it by writing a script with keywords, I just have to find this fanfic.
