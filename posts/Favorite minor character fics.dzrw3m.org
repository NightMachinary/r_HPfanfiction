*** HP Fanfiction is what the Star Wars Expanded Universe used to be. If there was a character in the movies, then they likely featured prominently in a novel, comic, or short story at the very least.

And it's similar for HP Fanfiction. So many stories about minor characters and minor events. It's truly wonderful.

Finally: If the series is so badly written then why are you wasting your time on a subreddit about the very series you dislike? It seems like you could be spending your time in a more meaningful manner. Like reading a series you actually enjoy and not being a hater. For example I'm not a fan of A Song of Ice and Fire.

Not what I meant. People use it as it's the final argument for the new trilogy being bad, a disney cashgrab, the end of times, or whatever they want.

Stories can have one bad element and still be good stories, or enjoyable ones at the least.

Oh, there are many, /many/ arguments why the new trilogy is bad. Even Mary Sues and agendas aside: Episode VII was basically a remake and not a sequel and they've written themselves in a corner with Episode VIII- most of the Resistance was destroyed- I think they said they were down to something like 300- 400 people. (But magically they have a whole new army and armada in the trailers for Episode IX, because... reasons.) There are quite a few videos on youtube that explain it a lot better than me. MauLer has done several excellent long videos explaining why and how much the new trilogy sucks.

** If you want a Fletcher as a good guy character, he's one of the supporting characters of the Promises Unbroken trilogy. In it, he's an ex-Auror scarred by his experiences in the war against Voldemort (which never stopped, so James/Lily are also alive and main characters), but he's a good man. Bonus points because Peter Pettigrew is involved, I'll avoid spoilers but he's also portrayed as a main-ish character.

In terms of minor characters, the spotlight is firmly on the Marauder generation (James, Lily, Sirius, Remus, Peter, Severus...) and since in canon they're not "main" characters I'm guessing they fit into your wish for good fics on minor characters. Also features a non-Squib Arabella Figg, and an OC sister (Julia) to Lucius Malfoy.

Ngl writing about this fic makes me want to reread the whole thing, so that's what I'll be doing :)

Oliver Wood is hilariously, frighteningly obsessed with quidditch in this:

Also, I think I'm the only writer to ship Ron's great aunt Tessie with anyone.
