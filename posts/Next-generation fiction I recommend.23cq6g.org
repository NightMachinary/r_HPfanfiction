I recommend this Albus Potter series. It has five books out, (the fifth was just released) and the author swears to finish them all cause they're all apparently already written just without minor edits.

I dunno if you guys have a standard like 'only red next gen fics where al is Gryffindor/Slytherin but this fic is pretty good regardless, especially in the characters department. I highly recommend it. Especially cause I think it deserves more attention.

** I skimmed a bit and it seems interesting. I'm in the middle of a long fic now, but it can go on the pile.

*** Well, whenever you get the chance. I kept up with the stories, I usually don't have much to say in a review but it certainly deserves the attention.

Which fic are you reading btw?

**** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5681042/25/Heart-and-Soul][Heart and Soul]], a Harry/Fleur/Hermione fic. Seems decent so far, not the best I've read, but worth reading at least.

** Started reading the first one and love it already! Unfortunately, it looks like he just started the fifth book (rather than finished it), and I don't think I'm up to the challenge of starting another WIP story (hpmor has taught me that lesson). He says they are all finished, but it took him almost a year to publish book 4. Hopefully I'll notices the series again in 3 years, because it looks sweet!

*** What do you mean by WIP?

Yeah. When I PMed about it, he said he just had edits to do but because they are all finished, readers could be assured that they will all make it.

**** Write/Work in progress. While I appreciate the fact that he won't abandon the story, it's still taking a really long time to post the stories.
