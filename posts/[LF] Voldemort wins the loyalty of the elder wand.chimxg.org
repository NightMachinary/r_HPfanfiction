  Voldemort's mastery of dark power was unrivaled in history. Grindelwald's legendary charisma came a hairsbreadth from bringing Europe to its knees. "Now, which one will it be for you, Mr. Potter?" Massive AU, Durmstrang Harry

  Five years after his defeat the shade of Voldemort visits Harry Potter, and has a slight accident with one of his Horcruxes. The Dark Lord wanted a new body, but this isn't what he had in mind.

*** It kinda reminds me of Taure's minister riddle.

But really, I wanted a Voldemort diametrically opposed to Harry.

Thanks though.

** This is an interesting idea, because nobody gives it to him for fear of being to powerful, and even in the dark harry ones where he's a protagonist they just give it to Harry anyhow. All in all, I feel like this hasn't been done yet

*** I hate fics where they just do that.

You see, I actually prefer the movie version of the fight than the books, because in the books, it makes it seem Dumbledore could kill Voldemort at any time.

But this is a man who broke into Nurmengard. Who developed unmanned flight. Who put a taboo on his name. He's called the worst dark lord and I want to see it. A man who Dumbledore stalemates only because of an ancient super wand. A Harry forced to deal with essentially a monster of legend. Voldemort was pretty much unchallenged after Dumbledore died. My headcanon is that if he found out the full prophecy, he would have killed Dumbledore himself, as he would have not feared the man.

If I wrote a fic and included the Hallows, I'd probably make them man-made and have other super wands and artifacts.

**** My view on the Hallows is they are magical objects, but made in such that causes them to not lose strength overtime while other magical objects fade

The elder wand, all wands gain power overtime but typically they get burried with the user or go to a family vault for decades

where as the Elder-wand was constantly in use, with many different users who prefered many different spells

***** That's a fair theory, and I believe might be backed by some evidence from canon.

I prefer the magical objects have strength through symbolism route. Since the threstral is related to death, I think a single particularly powerful threstral provided most of the material for the Hallows.

The tailhair provides the wand. The wood is less important, but an elder tree that formed the bridge the brothers used over a deadly river was the wood.

The cloak was from the fur. Only those who have seen death can spot a threstral.

The resurrection stone was a bezoar from said threstral
