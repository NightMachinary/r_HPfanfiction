I would say it's a toss up between Defence Against the Dark Arts and Transfiguration.

With the Defence Against the Dark Arts replaceing Care of Magical Creatures as a core class with it being a completely new class that was made by takeing parts of the curriculum that used to be taught in other classes but mostly Care of magical creatures and charms.

Transfiguration is my other guess for the newest core class, I think it used to be an elective, and when it became a core class it replaced Divination which is why there is such animosity between the masters of the two branches of magic. I ask so think that when divination was demoted to being an elective it was split into two class Divination and Arithmancy.

What do you think is hogwarts newest core class?


** There's no way Transfiguration was ever an elective. Divination appears to be bunk in canon, whereas Transfiguration is an endlessly useful branch of magic. McGonagall doesn't like Divination because it's nonsense.

I'd think DADA is the newest core class, possibly (speculation) starting after the Grindlewald business.

** Probably Defense Against the Dark Arts, once the Ministry started cracking down on using dark magic, Hogwarts made learning Defense mandatory.

** I think before it was called Defense against the Dark Arts it was just named Defense. Around the 18 century there was a good possibility that you had to defend yourself against Swords, so Mundane Duelling Lessons and Magical Fighting. As soon as Swords came out of favor the switched to Defense against the Dark Arts.

** Most likely Defense Against the Dark Arts, i would go so far and say at some point the Dark Arts was a class after all what use is a Stunner when fighting against a group of wizard and witches and against magical creatures personal i would use lethal or at least damaging spell so i guess somewhere around middle ages where is was dangerous having magic such class at least exist Defense Against the Dark Arts most likely only a modern non lethal of th Dark Arts class that i believe where taught in the middle ages.
