** I find the Weasley family life to be interesting because they have many bad qualities, but also a handful of redeeming ones. Some more than others, though. Charlie and Bill are relatively positive because they have such little screen time to be fleshed out as much as the other Weasleys.

#+begin_quote
  We never, ever see anything other than disdain and abuse towards Percy
#+end_quote

Percy was praised by Molly for becoming prefect and head boy, and was bought a brand new pet owl for school, while his brother Ron was sent to his first year at Hogwarts with a second hand wand. On the other hand, Fred and George never became prefect, and were annoyed with Molly's "That's everyone in the family, then", and said, "What are we, next door neighbors?".

I think the kids are alright, but a product of the parents. Arthur and Molly are shown to be so great at magic (enchanting a flying car, killing Bellatrix in a duel) but their skill is rarely used in the story to tangibly improve the lifestyle of their children. Why couldn't they Transfigure nicer robes and dress robes for their children, instead of buying shabby second hand or giving hand-me-downs? It's not against Gamp's Law....

From what you mention, Arthur is good at charms and Molly is an excellent dueller. That the Burrow is still standing in spite of the many lopsided additions are probably a testament to their skill. But they don't seem to have inclination or ability to pretty it up. Because that would be transfiguration, which they are not shown to be good at.

It could be that just putting 7 children through magical education and feeding and clothing them while at home leaves them utterly broke for anything else. They probably became quite comfortable in the years immediately following the books as the last child leaves Hogwarts and starts a career.

** You are doing the thing where you ignore every bit that contradicts your point while over exaggerating the things that support your point. I will only touch on one but I think it's the most important:

#+begin_quote
  No one in his family gave him any respect
#+end_quote

Throughout the books his parents are very proud of Percy and his accomplishments. It is only when Percy's hubris and ambition leads him to make a poor decision do his parents voice their displeasure. That's what good parents do.

You seem to completely ignore the fact that Percy has been around and exposed to Harry for years but decides to ignore everything he knows about Harry for the sake of his own ambition.

He messed up. For sure his siblings could have been kinder to him when they were growing but that doesn't change the fact that he messed up.

He was deluded. He was a fool that Voldemort, et. al. took advantage of. Would anyone else in that department blindly follow orders sent in by owl without question? When Crouch was discovered in the Forest, Percy was pulled in for questioning and yet he has no concerns at all that just a few months later he was put into a relatively senior post in the Minister's office when he should have been put on probation due to his foolishness.

** To respond to some of the points made :

-As said before, at least Molly and Arthur were proud of Percy's achievements. The only time they were not were during said promotion at the Ministry were "the father made it all about himself". But the thing is, they were right. Percy was just one year out of school and during this time had already made a massive blunder (following owl instructions that were not his boss'), there was absolutely no reason for him to get this promotion, unless you take into account the actual political climate (with his family a massive supporter of who Fudge consider an enemy).\\
- Fred and George jeered at Draco the first time they saw him. There is several possible explanations for that. Arthur Weasley and Lucius Malfoy know, and loath, each other, it's not impossible that they heard about the family from him. But even without that, there is still the possibility of Ron telling them about him (and all his remark about their family poverty) or just Malfoy himself, it did not take him long to present himself as someone unpleasant.\\
- They gave a tongue swelling sweet to Dudley. The twin test every of their inventions on themselves, they knew how the sweet worked and it's doubtfull it could have killed him (not good for business to sell killer candies). They also have a pretty bad vison of Dudley, mainly from what Harry told them and did it for him. Good intentions, bad realisation.\\
-Neville : what did they ever do to Neville? Apart from the Canary Cream, nothing come to mind. Compared to what Neville got thown at him (between his almost murderous relatives, overbearing grandmother, and malfoy), it seems pretty tame. I'm not even sure he was the intended victime (when I read the scene, I imagined that they had hidden some cream in the food, and any Gryffindor could have been victim of that).

All in all, the twin were not saint but seemed to be pretty good people and were, in comparison, way gentler than their idol the Maraudeurs. As for the parents, I still think they did a really good job at educating their children (can you even put Ginny temper to the count of education? Seem more of a natural thing). All of their children finished in respected position, even Fred who died at 20 was already the owner of a wealthy shop.

It's worth mentioning that Neville actually does join in laughing after he returns to normal. And you're right about the possibility of Neville being a victim by chance--the narration later goes on to state that several other students become victims of Canary Creams during the following days.

**** The points I talk about are the points I disagree with. I don't really have any excuse for what they did except "It's Montague".\\
The guy was probably a bad guy, or at least Harry thought so. But Harry may not be the best judge of character around, especially with other Quidditch players. And even if Montague WAS a blood purist (Umbridge seemed to love them) or even a futur Death Eater, I'm not convinced that's a good enough reason to do what they did.\\
They probably didn't think things through and acted impulsively, but still pretty dangerous.

*** Well, if you buy into wand lore, then it's lucky that it worked for Ron at all. According to Pottermore, Ash and unicorn hair is a combination that makes the wand especially loyal to its first owner and will not work well for anyone else after being passed down.

The fact that Ron is Charlie's brother probably allowed him to use it, but never to its full potential.

This likely exacerbated Ron's insecurities and self-worth issues.

**** The fact that Ron was able to keep up with Harry and Hermoine despite such a handicap speaks volumes about his abilities as a wizard even at such a young age. It's not emphasized, but it's implied that he managed to get at least passable grades in practical assignments during second year, even with a broken wand held together with spellotape. I'd wager very few of his classmates could do the same

** This seems to be an opinion brought about by fanon in my personal opinion. The Weasley family are undoubtedly flawed but they are a loving family. Fred and George tease Percy (and at times quite cruelly), but they do love him and Fred is the first to welcome Percy back to the family whilst George wanted Percy to hang out with them on Christmas in Philsopher's Stone.

Percy made a mistake, a major one and he knows it. Arthur indicated to him his appointment might be more than it appears (and it absolutely was) and Percy went off because it stabbed at insecurities close to his heart. Molly tries repeatedly to reach out to Percy only to be rejected cruelly each time. This is all on Percy.

  Evidently a lot of fans, particularly younger ones, just cannot wrap their minds around the possibility that there are major downsides to the underlying character of “Gryffindor”, and that, in fact, all Gryffindors are not, by definition, glorious --- despite ample examples in canon to the contrary.

** I agree with most of the post, and think you did a great job here. I just wanted to note that:\\
- the Weasleys probably know the Malfoy and their heir. When the twins first met Draco, they may already have noticed how much of a pompous git he was.\\
- Percy Weasley is mistreated by his family but I don't think (I have no example rn and no way to check it) he was always bullied or anything: in some families, the quiet and calm kid is looked down by the "cooler and active" one. However, I agree upon the motivation of his entry in the Ministry. - Psychologically, all the characters are at least a bit flawed. Arthur and Molly aren't bad parents, even though Molly is often protective and Arthur disconnected from the reality. I think your reflexion was greatly leaded. Feel free to correct my English

*** The whole bit about the Vanishing Cabinet horrified me and it's what tipped me over the edge. Granted, it was necessary for the plot. If Montague hadn't been shoved into the Cabinet and if he hadn't talked about what happened to him and Draco never heard about it, than JK would've needed to figure out another way for Draco to let Death Eaters into Hogwarts.

Harry and Ron also refused Hermione's suggestion to tell Pomfrey what they know in case it might help her heal him. That makes five people whose character was compromised over a decision to endanger the safety and unwittingly, life, of a fellow classmate. The twins would've left him there come what may. It just soured me towards Fred and George. I like them still but the pranking thing lost its charm then and there and I started thinking about what a thin line they walk and what lines they've crossed. Then again, adventure story in a magical boarding school. It was never meant to go that deep, the purpose was to further the plot. It does that very well and I never lingered much on these thoughts on my first few read throughs. I was completely immersed in the story, devouring the words and getting swept away on gales of mystery, speculation and excitement.

**** By joining Umbridge as part of her inquisatorial squad, I view these Slytherins as having willingly chosen sides in a war, and don't feel bad at all that some of them encountered terrible consequences. Hermione feeling so worried is typical of her, as she frets at others' violence while feeling her own is perfectly justified.

Umbridge was literally torturing children and spreading a xenophobic, genocidal agenda throughout a school. She should have gotten much worse than she did, and so should most of her little student followers.

** I made a similar post two weeks ago. I was also dismayed by the lack of positive interaction amongst the Weasley kids. They all have good character moments (especially with Harry), but their interactions with each other are almost always negative.

I must disagree about Arthur and Molly though. I think they're good parents. The kids got some issues, but all of them are good people (even Percy). The entire family fights in the final battle from the parents all the down to their youngest child. To me, that speaks to good morals planted by parenting.
