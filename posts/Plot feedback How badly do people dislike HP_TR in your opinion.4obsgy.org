I've been working on/fleshing out an idea for a lil bit in which the main relationships are between Harry, diary Tom, and Voldemort. Here's my dramatic summary:

#+begin_quote
  Tom Riddle's groundbreaking investigations in soul preservation were about to revolutionize wizarding existence, when the researcher suddenly died. Over a decade later, the boy Harry Potter opened a certain diary. Tom Riddle hadn't planned for his experiments to one day meet.
#+end_quote

Basically TR was interested in what horcruxes meant for the soul/body distinction, whether souls could be preserved as information, etc., and did a lot of experiments on himself as part of his research, producing along the way Diary Tom and Harry (like in canon he body-died when he used AK on Harry). The focus on the story would be Diary Tom and Harry forming a relationship, Diary Tom confronting the mystery of what motivated his future self to become Lord Voldemort, and both pursuing TRs research (while dealing with that they're both horcruxes).

Clearly HP and TRs relationship is not the entire plot, but would still frame it. I'm trying to decide whether it should be romantic or platonic. I personally love the pairing, but don't need it to happen in this story, so am wondering how unpopular it is. If it seems like readers don't care either way I'd just leave it in. Thoughts?


** I don't like Tom Riddle/anyone, unless it's Tom feigning love to achieve some goal. His inability to love is so crucial to Tom's character that forming any kind of genuine relationship is vastly out of character for him.

  The heroes from Altered Destinies, written by Anaklusmos14, are sent back in time to read about their adventures, namely Percy. The son of Hades and his friends and family read Altered Destinies, I recommend reading Anaklusmos14's stories because they are really good. I do not own Altered Destinies or the characters. There are a few profanity, but most of the time it is tame.

** I absolutely hate it, the most of any sort of interactions/pairings. Because honestly? That fucker killed Harry's parents. This is often dissuaded by Harry deciding they were the bad guys in the 1st war, or Voldemort was secretly a good guy, or some other such bullshit.

** I read a lot of slash and pretty much refuse to read this pairing 99% of the time. I'm already really picky about Snarry fics because those are cross-gen, usually very OOC or AU and require a ton of Snape redemption. I feel like LV is in the same boat only worse because he's pretty much unredeemable. Diary age TR might be different though because he's not fully LV yet and is a complicated character who could be good to read - especially with time travel fics or a plot device like yours where the age gap isn't huge.

I have never read a HP/LV fic and doubtfully ever would. HP/TR and Snarry are borderline but I'll read them if a non-slash reader or a DM/HP or wolfstar shipper recommends it. Your plot does sound pretty intriguing though and if well described in the blurb, I think you could definitely get some atypical readers.

Also, I'd post that fic on Ao3 (if you were not planning to already) because I think that's where many(most?) slash readers are these days.

** You'd be surprised. It's not necessarily one of the most popular, but it's not as unpopular as you'd think. If nothing else, I've come across stories on AO3 that have been up for less than a week and have already gotten close to 200 cudos. I remember I used to think that it would be shunned by the HP community, and you wouldn't be hate-free if you wrote it, I imagine, but I was talking to a fellow Tomarry shipper that was telling me how people just generally ignore the people in that fandom haha.

As you've probably gathered by now, I am personally a huge fan of this pairing. I'll read most any stories that are written about it because I'm like a vacuum at this point, but to be fair, my favorites are the ones that don't glorify the kind of person that Tom is, and try not to change Harry from the person that he's inherently meant to be, as well. I think it's more believable that way, but that's just personal preference. Aha.

One other thing I thought I'd bring to your attention: I've noticed that the Harry Potter & Tom Riddle tag gets less traffic/views/whatever than the Harry Potter/Tom Riddle tag, so if you're concerned about readers, you'd probably want to lean towards the latter. I also don't think that people that dislike Tom and Harry having any sort of relationship in general are going to be more apt to read something that's platonic versus slash, so you might not necessarily want to cater to them. But my bias could be getting in the way... so honestly? Just write for you, man. I write terribly angsty tragic and just confusing little ficlets, and they receive such a tiny amount of traffic, but it's all just for me (for the most part). So just do what makes you happy!

I feel like there was something else I was going to say here, but uh. I don't know what that might've been. --Oh! Yes!

You should definitely let me know when you start posting this; I'd love to see what you do with the concept! It looks very interesting, and the only thing that I'd recommend you is to make the summary more engaging. I like the background information that you've given us, but the summary itself probably wouldn't have drawn me in. Just a little bit of advice though! Whatever you do, good luck to you!

** Sure! Sounds great! I would adore a romantic relationship with this plot. Though, you have to remember, this subreddit isn't made up of many slash readers. Fewer still is those that enjoy pairings like SS/HP or TR/HP. Even I won't ship LV/HP, because (like another commentor pointed out) he's the man who killed Harry's parents and there are some things you can't/shouldn't get pass. Tom Riddle isn't that same man yet and has room for (some) change.

That was the first thing that ran through my head when I read OP's question. While not nearly as bad as the DLP forum (f#cking DLP), there's a noticeable imbalance between those who favor het and those who favor slash (or both) in this subreddit.

***** 10/10 would recommend. I distinctly remember going on a total binge of this author's works when I first found her. Still do sometimes, just due to the insane amount of work she's done. I loved so many of her stories, and I'm pretty sure that she is one of the reasons I'm a lot more on-board with Drarry than I used to be. Aha.

I can agree with you on pacing though. It does tend to be an issue in some of her works, but as you've mentioned, it tends to be minor and easily overlooked (at least, in my experience). I hope you enjoy her things!

** I /love/ HP/TR so my vote is definitely for 'romantic,' especially as there aren't nearly enough /good/ harrymort fics in the fandom.

Contrary to what most people think, the pairing is actually quite popular. As long as it's well-written and well-told you're going to receive a pretty sizable following, so don't worry about that.

Yes, there will be people who will be turned off by the pairing--either because it's harrymort or because it's slash in general--but who cares? Some people can't stand the idea of Riddle being anything other than Harry's antagonist, but you shouldn't let that deter you from writing the fic you want to write.

Anyway--definitely send me a link to the first chapter as soon as it's up. Gen or slash, it sounds like my kind of fic (I'm crossing my fingers that it'll be the latter, though!).

**** For Tom/Harry with fantastic characterization of both of them, anything by The Fictionist ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2227840/The-Fictionist][FFN link]], [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/The_Fictionist/works][AO3 link]]) but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5725656/1/Fate-s-Favourite][Fate's Favourite]] linkffn(5725656) and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5736901/1/Past-s-Player][Past's Player]] linkffn(5736901) are particularly excellent in my opinion. Tom edges on evil and not very very well, and the dialog is snappy and smart. Harry also /isn't a doormat/. I couldn't finish [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/934466][Solace in Shadows]] linkao3(934466), but I have heard excellent things about how dark Tom is, without being an over the top dramatic prat. The Fictionist also does excellent almost slash: no explicit sex, and a sort of "only if you want" relationship feeling. As some people will be absolutely put off by slash, that might be the way to go. You can always add the relationship stuff in a separate fic as 'extras', which is easier to do on AO3 then FFN.

For explicit slash: I'm going to recommend [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/384445][SCHOOLED]] linkao3(384445), even if it gets a bit silly and appears abandoned, because that first chapter is absolutely one of the best revenge fics I have read. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/266699][The Love of a Good Wizard]] linkao3(266699) may be a little too fuffly for what you want, but it /is/ lovely, and worth a read anyway. It also has what I think must be the only Minerva McGonagall/Pansy Parkinson in existence. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/439865][Again and Again]] linkao3(439865) has a nice story which the focus isn't Harry/sane!Voldemort, and is one of the better time travel stories out there, especially for the early chapters which are sort of outsider POV. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1161859][House of Snakes]] linkao3(1161859) is more Harry raises Harry story then Harry/Tom, but at the end there is some nice justification of why Tom may want to be with Harry.

MPREG warning: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9591343/1/Some-Other-Beginning-s-End][Some other Beginings End]] linkffn(9591343) is good Harry/Voldemort(Tom). [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/526351][Je Souhaite]] linkao3(526351) is pretty good too.

For non slash I'm going to recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10972919/1/The-Evil-Overlord-List][The evil overlord list]] which is a great young Tom story linkffn(10972919), even if it isn't quite what you are after (more humour/crack).

**** Don't mind me, I'm just butting in after scanning over comments once again.

The first fic that comes to mind with caring Harry and manipulative-but-still-quietly-caring Tom is linkao3[Lithium by Grayxclouds]. Well, let's see if that works? I don't even know. Anyway. It's a good read, but I think it's also good at portraying - to an extent - the kind of relationship that could happen between Harry and Tom while staying somewhat true to canon. You should definitely give it a look! I'm sure there are other fanfics out there, but I can't think of them right now due to tiredness, so who even knows.

** I absolutely hate the idea of pairing Tom Riddle/Voldemort with any Book protagonists.

However, someone being abused as much as Harry is more likely to turn bad than that all-loving Book Harry, so I can definitely see a cunning, hateful and ruthless Harry coming to Hogwarts. This Harry would above all desire power, and generally had the same mindset as the young Tom Riddle. During year 1, I would still have him making friends/alliance with Hermione, because she was interesting, brilliant, quite ruthless, and most importantly, an abused (although not nearly as bad as Harry) loner too. Harry would definitely try to take the PS for himself, he may or may not get the stone.

When he picked up the Diary from the girl's bathroom, he and Diary Riddle immediately hit on each other, and Diary Riddle would suggest finding a different sacrifice. Assuming this Harry was in the Slytherin house, he could plant the Diary on anyone he didn't like. (Draco would most likely be the target due his atrocious behaviors)

Diary Riddle definitely had lots of things to do after coming out. He needed to build up his own strength, gather new followers, and investigate what happened to Voldemort. In my opinion, dark lords do not serve or share, so I can see Diary Riddle to actively work against his older self.

Maybe won't post it until I get a good way through so I can tag appropriately. I'm also glad for the feedback on whether Tom should be evil/grey/good, as well as Tom's inability to love, some things to think about.

** Young Tom Riddle has tons of possibility. Lord Voldemort has far less. You need to significantly repair him to make him a reasonable match for pretty much anyone, aside from Bellatrix.

Harry is kind of useless, so you have to improve him a fair bit to make him a reasonable match for anyone. Most authors do that automatically.

** I'm actually fairly certain I've seen a few fics with similar storylines, where Diary Tom can't accept what his future self has degraded into and teams up with Harry to destroy Voldemort etcetc... I can't think of any specific titles right now, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/search.php?ready=1&keywords=diary&categoryid=224&genreid1=0&genreid2=0&languageid=1&censorid=0&statusid=0&type=story&match=&sort=&ppage=1&characterid1=1&characterid2=1962&characterid3=0&characterid4=0&words=4&formatid=0][here's]] a quick search - make sure your fic isn't too similar to any of these :)

As for the pairing, as long as you write it well and make it convincing, most readers probably won't mind what direction you take it. TM/HP certainly can have a much more +twisted+ complex relationship than just romance, especially since you're planning on building on the Horcrux connection. Just make sure to state in the summary or first chapter that there is the possibility of future slash.

Not sure if this will be helpful or not but as a reader, although I don't mind reading slash, I'm always much more intrigued by the dynamics of TM/HP relationships when the romance is hinted at but not explicitly explored. Oftentimes whenever the romance between TM/HP or LV/HP is established, Harry automatically becomes the weaker in status part of the pair, which makes the plot much less interesting.

As you mentioned, Again and Again is very good, here are some other good LV/HP romantic fics if you want to explore:

  Dumbledore was sure he had made the right choice. Ten years later Harry shows him just how wrong he was. With little regard for most, Harry makes a name for himself at Hogwarts, and shows everyone that he is far more than just the BWL. In doing that he attracts the attention of the Dark Lord, making Voldemort believe that the Boy-Who-Lived could be far more than an enemy.

** Doing some random searching in this sub and found this thread. This looks really interesting, would you mind terribly sending me a link if you decide to post it? From the summary I'd prefer romance, but a friendship might be entertaining too :)

I personally feel the summary is fine as is. Provides enough info and with a twist at the end too. The summaries that try too hard to be dramatic instead of down to earth and succinct turn me off immediately. (i.e. summaries like "What if...??? What if...??? What if...?!?!!?! Will Harry....?? " Yeah. No.)

Also replying because I can't resist commenting on someone else's comment down there, about Tom not being able to genuinely love someone and that he should only pretend. Well, I'd say it depends. For example, towards the end of Fate's Favourite (which is also a story I massively adore), we're definitely walking on "caring" territory, and Tom's level of caring is definitely on par with Harry's feelings in intensity if they aren't expressed in exactly the same way.

In fact, Rowling implied that Tom might not be a born psychopath, which points to a possibility in developing some belated, stilted form of empathy, and even if he is, it doesn't suggest that he can't care for others in his own way, for his own reasons, and that these feelings aren't just as legitimate as everyone else's just because it comes from somewhere different. He might also be capable of "normal people feelings", just very, very rarely, and for a very, very limited number of people/things, which should be incredibly hard in getting out of him if we are to keep in character.

There's a distinction, I think, between Tom's real caring and his mask of caring, and I see two groups of writers make opposite claims: one group take his "mask" as truth (particularly in romance fics), as if he would even fall for someone who would fall for his guise, while the other group declares he could only ever be a cold-blooded, self-serving ball of pure cruelty and hatred, which seems reductionist and ignores the uncertainty that is Tom Riddle, instead placing Voldemort into his core, just with a little more intelligent and calm. Neither quite rings true to me.

If we are to ask "if he is capable of caring about other people, why didn't he ever in canon?" Perhaps he just never found someone who could see through him and was still willing to associate with him in some way for any meaningful relationship to develop. And knowing how good Tom is at acting, this isn't terribly unlikely. (Even though I wouldn't blame anyone for taking one good look and running for the hills. It would be the wise thing to do. But is it the thing Harry would do?)

(Not to mention the fact that we know very little about Tom Riddle, and even less reliable information. Almost all are second-hand. And very little information on the effects of Horcruxes...really, Rowling's background on Tom is just a mess.)

Anyway. Point is, even though Tom in love probably wouldn't look like just any other people in love, there isn't definitive proof that he can't have ever possessed the ability to love. I might have been all for the dark, unhealthy, manipulative relationship in this ship before, but Fate's Favourite made me reconsider that opinion. You might also be interested in checking out some psychopaths answers on Quora regarding their ability for "love" and what they seek in relationships (like Athena Walker's). It matches with FF really well, even though I'd say by the end of that fic Tom's feelings for Harry has definitely exceeded psychopath territory, which would suggest he wasn't a "complete" one to begin with, yet he is still very much in character. (Actually, it's debatable whether there really are any complete, natural born, incorrigible psychopaths. Research has mostly suggested it's a combination of nature and nurture. They might be predisposed to have low empathy - that isn't zero empathy, and it could be compensated for through development. Seeing as Tom is a teen, and we have magic - soul magic at that - I don't see why there isn't room for a little change in that regard.)

This is all just my opinion though. Anyway, please do send a link if you post it :)
