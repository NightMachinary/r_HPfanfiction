I don't really like them too much. Can anyone recommend some good fics that do it (relatively) tastefully. (ie no "Hi Harry, sorry about burning your possessions in front of you, ritually murdering Hedwig for my homosexual lover [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdtTfQJCO2Y][Tommi]] Confringoing your Firebolt and framing you for Hermione's murder when she wouldn't go to the ball with me because I thought you lied about putting your name into the goblet. Sorry about that mate, I guess you weren't. No hard feelings, right? I'd hate to lose your mon- I mean friendship.")

Edit: More specifically Ron bashing. I don't mind the other Weasleys.


** In my mind bashing is almost synonymous with a poorly written story. For instance, I hate Snape, but I much prefer to read fics with NO Snape as opposed to bashing. Bashing just inserts more scenes with the hated characters than otherwise necessary for the plot.

*** I either like or don't mind bashing in general. Hermione is my favourite character in the HP universe, yet I've read and enjoyed fics where she was bashed.

I don't get why this sub has this self-righteous attitude against bashing when there are several threads each week about harem fics as well as superharry and other things that really don't fall under good writing or good taste. I don't go around downvoting those things just because I don't l ike them, yet anything which is negative about Ron or threads that want Weasley bashing: just look at the points of this thread. And then there are several comments questioning or condemning it like yours, which is really off topic in a thread asking for stories with a specific genre within the fandom, a main purpose of this sub.

  “I don't get why this sub has this self-righteous attitude against bashing”
#+end_quote

For the most part, it is because bashing comes very close to “I don't like this character, let's make them stupider than they ever were and make them suffer, mwahaha”.

Here, let me give you a quote:

#+begin_quote
  “Bashing is a harsh, gratuitous, prejudicial attack on a person, group, or subject.”
#+end_quote

Do note the words “gratuitous” and “prejudicial”. And an attack on someone that is gratuitous and born from prejudice is not an attack based on what this person did but rather one based solely on the fact that you dislike the character so bad that you want them to suffer no matter whether it is deserved or not.

That is why the attitude. And though I will note that “tastefully done bashing” for the sake of comedy is something I don't mind all that much, there is the difference between critique for what one did, no matter how harsh and what sort of critique, and bashing someone; and most “tasteful” bashings are in fact on the other side of the boundary.

Case in point, getting onto Hermione's case because of her authoritative and know-better-than-the-subject tendencies and willingness to trust authority figures is not necessarily bashing; it might instead simply be a critique of her behaviour. And some people do judge automatically because when you get onto things that are guaranteed to be bashing (rather than “maybe on the other side, or maybe on the boundary or in its vicinity or something) there is quite a high chance that the story will be written poorly; in fact, many an author write stories with copious amounts of badly done bashing because they fail both as a reader (don't understand the characters) and as a writer (can't write a critique of a character without hitting them in a face with a metaphorical brick). But I'll stop before I go on a rant; I do that way too often as it is simply because there are still words to write and my keyboard is still working.

*tl;dr:* Because too many authors of fiction with bashing don't write good stories, and some people are fed up.

Most bashing fics change the canon in order to be pissed off at the characters. This fic has Ron acting exactly like his canon self except that it bothers the hell out of Harry.

****** Weasley Defence Squad is coming in - Ron is most certainly not a bad friend. Is he a bad influence in regard to schoolwork? Perhaps, but it's perfectly acceptable to not enjoy school. The two times he abandoned Harry are perfectly reasonable, if not the nicest thing to do. Just keep in context that Ron feels that he shares everything with Harry - his family/friendship/etc., and that Harry has done the same for him. When Harry is entered into the tournament, Ron's perception is that his friend betrayed him - not by entering in the tournament, but by not including him. (especially since Ron desperately wanted the prize money - he's rather insecure about his family's poverty) The second time is after Ron sustains a serious injury and is exposed to a horcrux on a journey that he doesn't need to be on. While Hermione is a Muggleborn and would be placed in Azkaban if caught, and Harry is, well, Undesirable Number One, Ron Weasley would have been able to stay at Hogwarts for an (unpleasant) seventh year. Instead, he risks his life to stick by his friends - and who can blame him when he makes a stupid mistake in a snap judgement there he immediately regrets? Ron's imperfections make him a stronger and more interesting character, in my opinion.

WDS out.

******* Not believing your friend when he tells you that he didn't do something is betrayal (it would only be worse if it lead to Harry either being (permanently) injured or dead...I mean come on, the guy was neglected (at best - abused at worst) by his relatives, so he isn't the most emotionally stable/grounded person around, so it's even worse for Harry!)

Doesn't need to be on? - He volunteered (!), Harry would probably have done it alone (he would probably have died for real then, but he would not have forced somebody into this - just like going to the DOM, where Harry wanted to go alone!)

Imperfections make for a more believable - but not for a more interesting/compelling - character (unless the character has really really bad flaws...Ron's jealousy (for stuff Harry would surrender in a heart-beat for a few precious minutes with his parents!) is really off putting (particularly if he's jealous about stuff he could achieve if he applied himself at school - he's a master at chess, so he isn't stupid! - like head-boy (he got the prefects badge after all - though IMHO it should have been Harry's!) or captain of the quidditch-team (ok, tough luck that Harry got that, but he's been on the team longer so it's fair!))

** Um, I suppose I know a few that happen to have that in it, though most of these will be H/Hr pairings so if you don't like that pairing, fair warning I suppose.

Most stories that file themselves under "Reptilla28's challenge" feature some amount of Weasley bashing, though I can't promise you'll find too many complete ones.

linkffn(The Real Us by Seel'vor) is essentially a reinterpretation of the canon 7 years without technically contradicting it, bashing every weasley except Arthur in the process.

linkffn(A Boon For Bill by canoncansodoff) hits Molly hard and Ginny to a smaller extent

linkffn(Faery Heroes by Silently Watches) has a dimension travelling H/Hr/L triad who end up spending a decent amount of time bashing Molly, Ron, and to a somewhat smaller extent Ginny.

linkffn(The Dark Lord's Equal by Lens of Sanity) is a bit of a mixed bag depending on the Weasley, but I would highly recommend it regardless of how it treats them. I realize most of this list is probably an acquired taste, but this is genuinely great.
