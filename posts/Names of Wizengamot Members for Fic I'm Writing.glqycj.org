I have been researching this online, but I haven't found many names. Who would be in the Wizengamot ten years after the end of the seventh book? Of the names I have found listed in the Lexicon, most are either dead or no longer on the Wizengamot when my story is set. There are two names (Griselda Marchbanks, Tiberius Ogden) that I think could still be there, but does anyone have any idea who else would be on the Wizengamot? I can make up names if need be, that's not a problem, but figured I'd see if anyone had any resources on the Wizengamot or remembers names that I don't.

​

For some context/background on the story: Harry is about to go on trial in front of the Wizengamot. This time he's accused of killing someone. This story explores mental illness, PTSD and abuse, but also love, friendship, and hope.

​

Thank you in advance for any help! :)


** That depends how much political power Harry's party has gained after the War.

I would totally expect the Weasleys to gain a seat, since they made up the bulk of the Order and was the core of the resistance. Molly killing Bellatrix in single combat means a lot in a world where magical power is respected above everything else.

As for other members, Shacklebolt, Slughorn, McGonagall, Longbottom, Bones, Abbott, Macmillan all should have some representations in the Wizengamot. For example, Susan Bones had several relatives (uncle Edgar, aunt Amelia) murdered by Death Eaters, she was a founding member of the DA herself, she participated in Year 7's resistance, and she took part in the Battle. With an impeccable track record like hers, She would certainly be in Wizengamot representing her family's seat.

From [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Sacred_Twenty-Eight][the Sacred Twenty-Eight list]], we know nothing about Fawley and Shafiq. They are most likely those "neutrals" who took no part in the war at all, and should keep their seats in the Wizengamot. You can invent all kinds of names and background for these people.

Greengrass is an interesting case. We know Astoria married Draco in canon. So they could be part of those "dark" families, or they can be those "neutrals" who only approached Malfoys after their turn. Daphne is a fandom favorite and if you get them involved, you may attract some readers.

I think that Hermione will in. If Nobby Leach could be a minister, Muggleborns could also be in Wizengamot. The establishment might as well appease to them after what they went through under Voldemort's reign of terror, and nobody else is more qualified than Hermione. If you want to put Harry on trial later, she being one of the judges will definitely make for an interesting story.

Finally Harry Potter. I think he might even get two seats, one for Potter family and the other for Black, which he lets Andromeda Tonks serve as his proxy.

*** This is well thought out and detailed, thank you!! Definitely gives me plenty of food for thought...If I may ask, what are your thoughts about people on the Wizengamot also being witnesses? I have Astoria, Draco, Hermione, and Kingsley all lined up as witnesses for the trial, I'd think them also being a member would be a conflict of interest? But, as you pointed out, they could just appoint people to serve by proxy, right?

**** I need to know more about your plot and world building.

In our world, witnesses and judges definitely cannot be same persons, but in magical Britain? In that place, it ultimately comes down who has the power (magical foremost, political second).

If you look at Trio's track record in the Books, they never care much about laws and rules, and especially not when they pursued some worthy goals. Hermione is particularly ruthless. If she's convinced of Harry's cause, she will go imho as far as inciting popular uprising to get him free.

Canon Ginny is another fanatic of Harry, as her reaction to Harry's Sectumsepra on Draco showed. Unlike Hermione who has her own agenda, Ginny is unconditionally loyal to Harry's cause, and she's a violent person.

Neville and Susan Bones should both be Wizengamot members and may serve as witnesses. These two, along with Ginny and Luna, were core of the Hogwarts resistance during Year 7. They fought and suffered together with rest of the students, and should have more pull with the student body than Hermione. Don't underestimate their influence after the War.

***** The story mostly revolves around two couples - Harry/Colin and Draco/Astoria. Harry's dealing with untreated PTSD that tears his relationship apart, and ultimately leads him to lose his grip on reality and accidently kill someone. Draco's dealing with his past with Colin and struggling with his bisexuality. I don't deal much with the political atmasphere, but it is mentioned that muggles/muggleborns are more widely accepted. It took some time for those on the wrong side (like Draco) to assimilate in to society, but things are more equal now, ten years later.

Neville and Susan are good choices for members. They're level headed and would ask the kind of questions I need them to ask to pull certain information out of the witnesses. And Luna would bring an interesting point of view to the hearing. These are great choices, thanks!

**** You could appoint a proxy. Maybe with news coverage have Rita Skeeter point out the "corruption" going on in the trial. Basically having her say that they would free Harry because they are his friends and supporters. Basically have her do the right thing for the wrong reasons. Basically question who involved in the trial and their relationship with harry. She could mention family and friendly ties led to backroom deals that nearly led Voldemort to win.
