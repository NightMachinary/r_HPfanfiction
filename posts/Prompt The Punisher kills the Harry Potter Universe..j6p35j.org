Punisher kills the Marvel Universe, but in HP.

Would make a nice dark comedy fic.


** Fun idea. I hope someone takes this and runs with it. I'm assuming in this Universe Frank's family is killed by Deatheaters? I'm imagining a Harry/Frank team up going like the Daredevil/Frank teamup in Season 2 of the show where Frank keeps trying to murder and Harry keeps disarming him. Great prompt

** Imagine instead of Frank Castle, it's Frank Longbottom.
