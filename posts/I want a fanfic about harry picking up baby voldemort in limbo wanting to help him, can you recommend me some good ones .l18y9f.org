*** So apparently I messed that up. But pretty much Harry decided to take Tom and move on. He raises him in another world as a single father. Unfortunately it's abandoned but I enjoyed it anyway.

** Yes, there was one awesome with fem!Harry, who just couldn't take leaving dying baby behind in the Heavenly King's Cross, and she handed it over to the spirit of Merope Riddle. It was just few chapters maximum, but I couldn't find it now.

** Linkffn(Animus, Anima:English Version) fits the prompt perfectly. Dark , complete. Metaphorical Mpreg warning for first chapter.

#+begin_quote
  In limbo, Harry makes another choice and finds himself in a baby's body: little Tom Riddle. Years pass and intimately bind the orphan and his imaginary friend, in a hopeless and incestuous relationship. Indeed, all the odd events of Tom Riddle's life happen in spite of Harry's presence: could he be the one who provokes them? Time travel, UA but as canon as possible. HPTR - COMPLETE
