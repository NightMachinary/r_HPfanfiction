He is just really calm in every situation. Does't get angry easily. You can't provoke him.


** The scene in the graveyard:

Voldy: "... Avada Kedavra!"

Harry after calmly stepping aside from the curse, "So, you are Voldemort is it? You look better now than 3 years ago mate but are you feeling alright? you look a bit pale, it must be years since you ate anything, poor chap!".

Voldy: "Draw your wand Potter! ... Crucio!", only for the spell to miss his target as Harry bends down to pick up his fallen mokeskin pouch and take out a platter of treacle-tart from it to show Voldy.

Harry: "Here you go, mate! my emergency stash for when I get kidnapped and have nothing to snack on, have a bite and I guarantee you it will add some color to those cheeks. Get something into that stomach of yours and you will calm right down."

Basically, Harry thinks Voldy is Hangry.

** He has this personality in Harry is a Dragon and That's Okay by Saphroneth. I will admit that I haven't been keeping up with this fic, but I'm still following it and it recently went over 100 chapters. linkffn(13230340)

I also really like his personality in The Price is Right by Hi Pot in Noose (sequel IP), in which his adventures in his first year of Hogwarts are delightfully surreal and he just goes with the flow. linkffn(9894129) [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2337458][or on AO3]].

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

  Point of deviation: Harry's primary school taught Home Economics. Harry's not going to let the wonders of magic take away his common sense, and if he can get a good deal, he's going to take it. Meanwhile, money is fun, but magic is funner. AU

*** There's nothing going on in Dragon, no conflict, nothing - they just go to Hogwarts. At first I thought its just a canon rehash but Harry is a Dragon, but no, there's a bit more to it, but not much. New students, Harry is a bit smarter, there's some questions on racism/speciesism but it doesn't go anywhere, raised in year 1 and forgotten until year 5, dragons. But there's no excitement, no action, just a normal school but magic and Harry is a Dragon. Most excitement was year 5, we got, as one might expect, Umbridge, and I thought now the fun will start, but no. She's just a joke. As author puts it themselves - it's hard to do anything bad when you got no special powers and all your coworkers hate you.

tl;dr - I'm disappointed, does it get better or is it just "they go to school"? Even Voldemort is a fucking joke, and he's a main bad guy.

**** I've seen it described as a "slice of life" fic, which I guess is a fancy literary term for "no real plot, just plot devices." Does it get better? Like I said, I haven't been keeping up with it so I really can't say. It's on my "reread when it's done" list, which is why I'm still subscribed.

I did like the bits in the early years, with him trying to figure out how to get around his physical challenges, such as the broom classes, and getting lost while flying to town (because navigation is A Thing) so they make a plan to send letters with Hedwig so he can follow her back for if it happens again. And I absolutely adored the mentions of the twins: "Fred and Possibly Fred," "he decided to call them both George that day," etc. (It was actually a bit disappointing when he learned to tell them apart because I really liked that." And them all getting their animagus forms, and learning to work with them ("throwing" Ron the squirrel during battle, for example) was pretty cool.

The most recent chapter says there's only an epilogue left, so it's at least coming to some sort of resolution (or at least to an end).
