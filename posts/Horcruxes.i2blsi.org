What I don't understand ist why they are called the darkest magic. I know you have to murder someone but there are tons of spells that are worse. The Cruciatus and Avada Kedavra. If someonen uses those why wouldn't they make a horcrux. They kill people anyway at least so they get immortality.


** Horcruxes are the â€˜darkest magic' because creating a horcrux means tearing apart your soul, which is obviously a pretty horrific concept.

*** But didn't Dumbledore say that your tear apart your soul everytime you kill someone?

**** I don't know in what language you read the books, but in French, it's made pretty clear that killing, murdering someone only "fissure" the soul, while creating an Horcruxe completely tear it.

I think you could compare that to having someone scarry himself, and having someone else litteraly rip his limb out. Both are bad, but one is worse than the others, and way order to heal.

***** It's similar in English. If I remember correctly, simply killing someone isn't enough -- it has to be an act of /murder./ Cold-blooded premeditated killing. So something like Harry killing Quirrel in book 1 wouldn't count, because that was self defense. Snape killing Dumbledore wouldn't count either because that was pre-arranged between them, basically an assisted suicide. And then the Horcrux creation itself involves some sort of ritual that JK has never divulged to the public but allegedly made her editor throw up when she told him.

**** I think the wording was that murder damages the soul, whereas creating horcruxes actively years it apart.

**** I'm going to use a metaphor from a completely different series to explain how I see the difference. In the Wheel of Time series, there's a group of people who follow the "Way of the Leaf." This is a pacifist lifestyle where, just as a leaf does not fight where it may fall, they seek never to harm another living being. The explanation they give is that violence damages the one who does it as well as the one who is attacked. An axe may chop down a tree, but the axe is also dulled by the wood.

Using this metaphor, killing someone is like the axe chopping down the tree. The killer's soul is hurt like the axe is dulled, but it can be healed like the axe can be sharpened. But to create a horcrux is like leaving the axe embedded in the tree, then taking a hammer and pounding it in further before breaking the blade with part of it stuck in the tree. Now you have a broken axe. You could sharpen it again, but it will never be whole. To create a horcrux, you have to destroy another person's life and irrevocably damage your own soul. That seems a bit darker to me than just killing a person,

** Killing someone tears the soul but those tears can heal. Murdering someone and using that murder to rip off a piece of your soul and store it somewhere means it can never heal. That's how I always understood it. Also we dont know what goes into the creation of a horcrux beyond the murder. The ritual itself could and probably is pretty horrific

** I always keyed in on the comment of "taking the life of an innocent" to me that meant killing a child as only the youngest are truly innocent. However, that explanation truly doesn't cover Myrtle or the creation of nagini as a horcrux though the murder of the baby to make Voldemort's homunculus could account for that. Of course canon implies if not states that the death of Bertha was used for that.

In my mind that would make the killing just a little more horrific then all the other murders.

** The idea of removing part of your soul. You remove part of you, part of your humanity. And you come closer and closer to literally being a souless monster.

** I think the idea is that a) It is as bad as Avada Kedavra, and b) You are violating the order of magic. JK Rowling has said before she likes to have a logic, a system of organization to the magic, and it seems that just as love is very old magic, a Horcrux is as well, but one that tears apart the soul, which I believe Dumbledore calls something along the lines of 'The greatest violation'.

*** I don't think Avada Kedavra isn't the worst spell ever. I mean, dying by the entrails expelling curse sounds much much worse than an instant death. I'm not saying that the killing curse is a good spell, but there are much worse ways to go. But I do agree about the split soul being unnatural. It seems like the soul is the way it should be and should stay that way in order to stay sane.

**** There's a lot we're not told about what makes dark magic dark and why the Unforgivables in particular are worse than the alternatives. Given that the killing curse isn't depicted as being particularly violent in and of itself, it seems likely to me that the reason it's considered so dark ties into something about how it works at a fundamental level, or perhaps the intent needed behind the spell. Crouch-as-Moody claims that a class of fourth years could all cast it at him simultaneously and he wouldn't get so much as a nosebleed, while Bellatrix says the cruciatus only works if you actually intend to cause harm. So perhaps part of why the Unforgivables are Unforgivable is that successfully casting them at all is /de facto/ proof of intent to kill/torture/enslave. Whereas an entrail-expelling curse, on the other hand, might have a fig leaf of an excuse along the lines of "I didn't /mean/ to do it!" (As flimsy as that would be.)
