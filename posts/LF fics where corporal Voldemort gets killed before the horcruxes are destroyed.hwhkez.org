Possible reasons: 1. Harry just can't be bothered, either arrogance or some weird warrior philosophy thing about having worthy enemies. 2. Part of a plan: maybe mitigate losses while writing towards a final victory, or they have some way to trap the spirit. 3. Ignorance, maybe Snape failed to inform him, maybe Dumbledore dies after the battle of the DOM..

(I really don't like it when stories have all these reasons to not do anything 'i can't fight Voldemort and I have to hold back the order from combat cuz Harry is the chosen one ' ' no Harry you can't fight Voldemort yet cuz there's still horcruxes ' blablabla)


** 4 But they were, all of them, deceived, for another horcrux was made

No holding back, just punch the fool! Almost becomes a running gag. Die, move on to the next horcrux...

** It actually makes sense to kill hin. It would take a lot of time for him to come Back, so while he was trying to get a body Harry could search for the Hocruxes. I never understood why Snape didn't just place a bomb in their headquarters. Voldemort would be a spirit and many of his followers dead. More than enough time to destroy the Hocruxes afterwards.
