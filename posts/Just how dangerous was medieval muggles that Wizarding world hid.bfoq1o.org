I just read the linkffn(purge by redbayly) so I actually checked online some of actual stuff done and got me wondering about the actual witch findings

So... I'm not from any where near Europe and has very little idea of the impact of Spanish inquisition and the whole... Religious Burnings. I usually imagine a mob of torch and pitchfork from old movies so I can't imagine it.

I just can't imagine how it could drive a magical Race to hiding other hand the fact that magical, I assume, has low population that the each death means a lot more than a few muggles. Also. The sheer horror of the torture administered to people.

What do you think about the other possible factors that made medieval muggle dangerous to the general populace?


** I'm half convinced the line in PoA about the no danger of Witch Hunt is propaganda. I think the Witch Hunt was moderately dangerous was trained wizard (like it should be fine as long as you are carefull but if they catch you unaware it could turn ugly very quickly). Once caught, it was bad, flame freezing spell is nice and all, but when the angry mob see you in the fire not burning, you better have your wand ready to apparate or they will just have their proof that you are a witch/ wizard and try something else (like beheaded).\\
But even with this, I think the main problem was for the children. Wizard learn to Apparate in 6th year in books, and it's described as something difficult that a lot of people have troubles with, preferating other means like brooms. Muggleborn were just dead, 11 years of accident are enough to be burnt, and if not the summers could turn into a survival game for them.

​

Once hidden, I don't think the Muggles are a threat to wizards, but at that time, without being able to truly kill them to extinction, they could still be a major trouble.

*** Apparition requires a wand. A wizard caught by surprise and without his/her wand is pretty much dead meat, because hardly anyone can use wandless magic.

Even with a wand, it's questionable how many wizards can apparate without splinching under stress.

** Like someone else said kids would be in the most danger, accidental magic could happen and kids might not be able to apparate if it even existed at the time. Being caught unaware was bad. How long would it take for people to connect wands=can do magic on command and start taking the wands? Also who knows how many or what spells weren't invented yet?

** Muggles by themselves? Probably not to dangerous.

Muggles being used as catspaws by another magical who wants you dead? Pretty dangerous.

It's not like the muggles are going to know that the torches being handed out to the mob use magical oil that bypasses standard fire protection charms. An average wizard isn't going to expect a muggle mob to erect an anti-apparition barrier.

Also don't forget that muggleborns exist. A muggleborn exhibiting the "power of god's chosen" and taught to hunt evil by the church wouldn't exactly be a muggle.

A bad assumption and not at all based on the observable evidence of the HP series.

Anyone with an ounce of creativity can write up a functional backstory to explain it.

** Is it canon or fanfic that the Statute of Secrecy was enacted after the development of firearms? Accuracy was limited, but volley fire would be deadly, especially against wizards that weren't familiar with it. (And apparation is not an answer to every problem - a wizard could be caught by surprise, or splinch themselves by panicking.)

*** Guns really aren't the gamechanger people think they are - guns are /old as fuck/, and as weapons were worse than a bow against unarmoured targets.

Guns were around for centuries before they became more than just a loud bow, and back in the mediaeval period I'd expect them to know what guns are anyway.

If that sounds weird, please note that things are usually /around/ for quite a while before they become practical, and guns need to be cheap, /somewhat/ accurate (read: you have to be able to fire the gun while looking at the target, to make sure the gun is actually aimed at it), and either reliable or extremely useful in a specific niche (the gun is the latter - a knight involves a horse, a full suit of armour, and a man who has specifically practiced for /years/ in both - /ridiculously/ expensive compared to a metal tube, a metal ball, a chunk of gunpowder and a lit rope soaked in oil).

For guns to be used by peasants instead of strictly on the battlefield, though, the gun needs to be quite reliable /and/ cheap, which only really happened near the industrial revolution.

** They were not dangerous. Burning at the stake was not a threat because you had the flame-freezing charm which turned the fire into something that tickles you. There was even a witch who was into the whole thing and allowed herself to be captured countless times. And even disregarding that, apparation is a thing, so it is near-impossible to detain a magical (short of continuous torture or collaboration from someone with magic).

There was a line in the books (either by Hagrid or by Mr Weasley) that the wizards chose secrecy because they didn't want to be the problem solver for all Muggles.

As for concentrated military action, I don't see that playing all too well before WWI and even then you are very vulnerable to mind magic. You don't need to defeat an army if you can confund/imperius the commanders into leaving.

Nukes make for a decent deterrent unless you can eliminate all SSBNs, but even then it would be "mutual destruction" and not "Muggle Victory".

Tl;dr: Muggles can't do much against even somewhat skilled wizard.

*** Linkffn(Hermione Granger, Demonologist) addresses this in some depth. Freezing flames is all very well, but pretending to shriek in pain is not gonna cut it when you fail to blacken and shrivel. And that's assuming the mob allowed you (for some reason) to keep your wand while being tied up.

If Wendelin the Weird allowed herself to be burnt 14 times, have you ever wondered why she didn't make it to 15?

*** Okay.... So, I'm guessing here is that most magical that would have been kids, in trained muggleborns at least. But technically, they don't count since I'm assuming that eleven is the age where a muggleborn are recognized so most assume they are unfortunate muggle if there were. I'm assuming that before Hogwarts most muggleborns died off unless they are lucky and find a tutor or apprenticeship.... But then there's Ollivander's shop sign so I'm assuming there's already a wizarding town. So it might not be the case.

I suppose the fanfics I've read confused me in a way... Like you said Hagrid told Harry that people want magic to solve all problems. Though the first part I don't remember about flame freezing so I'm assuming that's from the books.
