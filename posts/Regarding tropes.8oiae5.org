I am relatively new to fanfiction. Today marks the 8th month of my journey through the world of fanfiction, and I must say I'm quite curious of how some tropes and story types came to be.

If you all wouldn't mind terribly, I'd like to know more about when, how, and why the following came to be.

* The List:
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: the-list
  :END:

1.  Soul Bonds
2.  Contracts
3.  Daphne Greengrass
4.  Dumbledore bashing
5.  Snape apologists
6.  Weasley bashing
7.  James and Lily bashing
8.  Time travel
9.  S/Hr (side note: what the fuck)
10. WBWL
11. The general portrayal of the Weasley twins as the good eggs in Weasley bashing
12. That one fic with Tonks and the Giant Squid
13. Magical cores
14. OP! Harry
15. Lord Hadrian Remus Octavian Sirius Herodotus Fleamont James Charlus Dostoyevsky Vladislav Karate Kid Potter-Black-Greengrass-Weasley-Malfoy-Ravenclaw-Gryffindor-Hufflepuff-Slytherin-Peverell

That's all the questions I have for now. Replies would be very much appreciated.


** - Well, someone looked at the canon mind-bond with Riddle and decided there was a way to make a "light" version of that work for a romance. May also have something to do with taking "soulmate" far too literally.

- There are binding magical contracts in canon, which, again, fanfiction writers pounced on, tweaked, and exploited the hell out of because they saw an opportunity there.

- Because Slytherins (and wealthy purebloods in general) are a bit too cartoonishly evil in canon, fanfiction writers who like the "ancient line of powerful and rich wizards dating back to Merlin" mystique, but don't want to engage in Death Eater apologism, want to ship Harry with a Slytherin girl who is /not/ associated with the Death Eaters. So they fished out Daphne Greengrass, who was both canon, a Slytherin, and /not/ a member of Malfoy's usual gang of goons, nor, as far as we know, the child of a Death Eater. As for the rest of her characterization, it mostly stems from the role they want to give her; she's the mysterious heir of the Ancient Powerful Family^{TM,} "educating" her disinherited boyfriend Harry, so of /course/ she'll be cold and distant at first, but also cunning, etc., etc.

- Professor Dumbledore does have a bit of "broken pedestal" to him --- he seems like a perfect Gandalf- or Merlin-like figure for the early books, and then we progressively learn he's just a human being who tries his best but made some mistake. That left a bitter taste in some people's mouth. Beyond that, a lot of the writers of heavy Dumbledore-bashing are rebellious teen-agers for whom old Professor Dumbledore embodies the "parents/authority-figures who put you down and act like they're /so/ wise and /always/ know best when really they're just being mean bullies to you". There's a reason Evil!Dumbledore always calls Harry "my boy" and Harry calls him back a "manipulative /old/ coot".

- Again, people see the world in black-and-white-colored glasses. Either Dumbledore is a perfect saint who'd never hurt a fly, or he's a puppy-kicking manipulative monster; well, the same thing's at play here. Once Snape was revealed to be on the side of good, one half responded by suddenly forgetting about all the terrible aspects of his everyday personality, and the other half said he was still an immoral bastard who's essentially just Judge Frollo in different circumstances. Neither interpretation is what Rowling wanted, but people just gotta people.

- The Evil!Weasleys fall under the same category as Evil!Dumbledore: they're the embodiment of a functinal family with very present parents, which no self-respecting rebellious teenager would like. So /clearly/ they too are manipulative bastards planning their children's lives for them. Ginny and Ron, to boot, are swept up in writers' clumsy attempts to justify a Harry/Hermione pairing without actually putting in the effort: "it's not that Hermione and Harry are /better/ suited for each other, see, but neither Ginny nor Ron were even a viable /option/ at all, see, 'cause they were EVIL, see, so Harry and Hermione totally /gotta/ make out now, see?"

- James-bashing is half-canon (nobody likes a bully) and exacerbated by people who idolize Snape and/or ship Snape/Lily, and thus need James out of the way. When both James /and/ Lily are bashed, this is usually because it's a "Jily lives" AU but the author /still/ wants Harry to be abused so he can be the underdog of the story. That, or, perhpas, it's too soften the grief of their death to their mind: "sure, it's sad Harry's parents died, but he wouldn't have liked them anyway". Also, again, rebellious teenagers gotta rebelliosu teenagers. No way can their self-insert hero's parents be anything but overbearing jerks and control-freaks.

- The "Peggy Sue" trope (going back in time inside your younger body and getting a chance to do things all over again) is well-established outside of HP fanfiction. I think one or two people brought it in as an interesting novelty and it struck enough of a chord that hundreds instantly copied it.

- Girl fans often identify as Hermione, both when reading and when writing --- which makes sense, as she's the most admirable and relatable young girl character in the books. So Snape/Hermione pairings are the consequence of fangirls who crush on Movie!Snape, and then write out their fantasies with Hermione as their self-insert.

- Like time-travel, my best explanation is, /one/ fic did that as its interesting premise /once/, people liked it, and they kept stealing the idea until it was no longer plagiarism but an established trope.

- As I argued above, Weasley-bashing is greatly based on rebellious teenage fantasies who want to tear down the "perfect", controlling family. Hence, Fred and George, who are /already/ rebellious teenagers who don't listen to their mum, are okay in those writers' books. Also, they don't get in the ways of any pairings that really matter.

- I don't know the one. I'm... not sure I want to know.

- Like wards, originally lifted from another magic system in another fiction; they mostly stuck as an easy excuse to make Harry naturally more powerful than everyone else without putting any effort in study or training. Admittedly it can also be used in a more forgivable (though still non-canon) way, to justify the idea of "magical exhaustion" and thus establish new limits for the characters.

- People like a power-fantasy once in a while where instead of a bunch of angst, their wish-fulfillment hero beats every challenge. It wouldn't do for professional writing, but in fanfiction, I think it's an understandable desire. I'm rather forgiving of that one.

- Harry discovering his family fortune in Gringotts was always a memorable scene. Add to that the mystique of the "Heir of Slytherin" business, and you've got "Harry is the Heir of [Insert Powerful Wizard Name Here]". Of course, it can also be an excuse to make him OP or even more absurdly rich than in canon.

**** Meh. I don't think that really factored into it, because those are fundamentally different kinds of time travel. Time-Turner travel is physical time travel /a la/ H.G. Wells or /Doctor Who/; you are sent backwards in time, body and all, and you may meet your past self there, although you shouldn't. Meanwhile, the sort of "time travel" we usually think of when talking about "time travel fic" is only a time travel of the mind, which goes back to the younger body.

It's true, of course, that the trope might not have become so popular if it was even more foreign to HP canon for lack of /any/ time travel in canon, but I don't think there was much relationship in the end.

****** Way predates the movie (but not the Days of Future Past comic). Still it's very easy to see how the idea independently arose. So much media has dealt with "messy" time travel, as does Harry Potter, where you have to set rules in-universe if you want it to operate as a narrative device of some sort. Time travel that moves a physical body can also get messy, especially if you go further back in time. You have to decide if this new Harry takes the place of the old one and disguises himself, and if the changes he makes actually have a lasting impact. You can also write it as a Harry-raising Harry story or whatever. More broadly, you have to decide if you want time loops to be closed or open, essentially splitting off the world into a "separate timeline" based off a single change, etc.

In fanfiction specifically, time travel is the ultimate form of a fix-fic, which is definitely a reason many people got into fanfics. You have characters who start the story with the same knowledge that you have as a reader, but able to enact changes with numerous branching consequences. It's a form of story telling that's more effective in fanfiction than it would be in traditionally published literature.

It comes from a popular theory back in the day, that Harry Potter was Heir of Gryffindor (since he pulled the sword out of the sorting hat). Then they also made him Heir of Slytherin (Right of Conquest (non-canonical, I believe), afterward once Harry's Horcrux became a thing, they started to use this as an excuse for the Heir of Slytherin.

Sure, but not to the extent of "ward-breaker" being a profession, or of Hogwarts' Wards being famous. So-called Warding also has nothing whatsoever to do with Runes in canon, unlike the fanon version --- which is specifically the sort of fanon Wards I was referring to: the ones based on magically-charged runestones.

Well, not quite. He could still theoretically die some other way, though as we know from the Prophecy that "would not" come to pass. But then again, with extraordinary enough foreign agents involved (say, time travel), Prophecies /can/ canonically be broken even if they had previously locked into effect. So who knows.

Also, Dumbledore sort of stockpiled safeguards for the Killing Curse in the Forest; the mother's blood protection was /part/ of it, but then, so was Harry being the master of the Elder Wand which refused to harm its master. It's unclear which of the two saved him in the end; perhaps the two were required, and the mother's blood wouldn't quite have cut it on its own for something as powerful as /Avada Kedavra/.

Honestly, if we follow the assumption that "[Dumbledore's] guesses are usually right", then there's no doubt that Lily's protection is what guaranteed Harry's survival in the Forest, as it's exactly what he says in King's Cross.

As for the safeguards, Dumbledore certainly did not intend Harry to gain the mastership of the Elder Wand, as he intended to transfer it either to Snape or not at all, dying undefeated (wether Voldemort's grave robbing would actually count as gaining mastership in that case is not explored in canon).

An actual safeguard planned by Dumbledore may well be the protection from Voldemort and his allies granted to everyone else through Harry's willing sacrifice. A way to even out the odds even if Harry were to die in the Forest.

The smut actually starts rather late in the story, it's a genuine /Tonks/Giant Squid romance/. And the writer is clearly aware of how ridiculous this all is, too --- tuxedo Squid who talks like Sean Connery, really now?

(The relentless nitpicker in me cannot help but point out that the quip about "what her latest ex-boyfriend did every Wednesday" seems to kind of contradict the big thing that is made of her virginity earlier, but yes, I know that I should probably not be questioning the internal logic of a Tonks X Sean Connery the Top Hat Octopus story.)

** Part one:

1.-2. Soul bonds & Contracts & Marriage Laws - with magic as an enforcer, this is a clumsy but widely-used trope to make two (or more) unlikely lovers be forced to be together. With the Law/Magic/Creature features there to justify the whole thing, it becomes an excuse to start the copulating at a much younger age than modern Western society would prefer and yet somehow still be considered 'wholesome' by others.

3- Daphne Greengrass is a once-mentioned character from Slytherin who distinguishes herself by not being stupid and catty like Pansy or ugly and brutish like Millicent. If you want Harry to slip into the Darkside, she makes a suitable substitute for creating an Original character.

4- (skipped to include in general Bashing coverage)

First of all, there's more than one. Secondly, you have to take into account that there are literally over a million Harry Potter fanfictions stories out there, if you include fanfiction.net, archiveofourown.org, LiveJournal, SIYE, HPfanfiction, HpFanficauthors, and numerous other collective or ship-specific sites out there. In order to get noticed, some folk assume that they have to do something extraordinary with their story (and they're right). Since being competent, talented and/or insightful is difficult, they choose to be /extreme/.

Besides, there is a whole sub-kink about women and tentacles [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dream_of_the_Fisherman%27s_Wife][reaching back to antiquity]], and Tonks is one of the few that might be able to survive and appreciate it, given her shapeshifting capabilities.

** There's definitely not a 100% solid reason WHY tropes came to be, but one can speculate why they caught on so hard.

1.) People love the idea of soulmates. It's convenient to write about an instant connection between two characters you like together without actually having to put in the effort of developing a relationship through interactions/buildup. Typically this is used in longer stories, as people who read smut don't really give a shit about believable buildup.

3.) A blank slate character that doesn't have an "evil" canonical background despite being in Slytherin. Same applies to Tracey Davis, but she's less popular. People use her to embody what they think Slytherin should be, as well as use her as a romance interest a lot of the time(or just a Slytherin friend) because of her not being outlined in the books very well. It's somewhat impressive how generally consistent her character archetype is written as in fanfiction.

4.) Used to give life to a new "main villain" at times. Details that are dubious from canon were picked up on to build a credible plot where Dumbledore is actually evil(even if he's a self-righteous evil person). Usually done fucking terribly though, but people I assume grew bored with having Voldemort as the sole villain to write about and wanted to explore other possibilities.

5.) People are weird, though writing Snape as an actually nuanced character is appealing. People who pretend his canon personality/actions are fine are silly.

6.) Typically this is "Ron bashing" rather than Weasley bashing, and happens because Ron is an annoying character that many people dislike due to his personality being annoying.

7.) Rarely see this outside of specific plots.

8.) A way to have characters interact/paired with characters from a different generation/time without there being a massive/creepy age gap, or just because they want their fic to take place in a certain time period.

12.) Hot.

** 6) This might seem a little strange at first, but I think that Molly Weasley was one of the people who hurt Harry the most. Not by some twisted love potion scheme or whatever the current bashing trend is, but by not doing anything about Harry's abusive home life despite claiming to care again and again.

When Harry arrives at the Burrow in CoS, Molly says something like "I was worried about you and Arthur and I would have checked in on you during the next weekend". Harry was broken out of a barred room with his school supplies under key and lock and after being kept on the brink of starvation, she says that she suspects something is wrong... And then she never does anything. If anything, sending the food in GoF instead of calling any authority (be it Muggle or magical) seems like twisting the knife further.

I know that this is mostly due to plot reasons, but as someone who has personal experience with promised help after abusive childhood events, it put her on my permanent shit list.

*** One of the issues when reading an abused Harry fic is that there is a very slim chance that the writer has actually experienced abuse. It's the same thing with depression, anxiety, autism, or any other mental condition that exists. Recently I read a fic where Harry was in a mental hospital, and it was just so incorrect, that it made me realise that the author had no experience and did very little research. I also read an autistic Harry who was pretty much pulled straight from the gaming definition of it.

Moral of this is that you cannot expect these authors to get abuse right, especially when every case is unique. Honestly, if an adult promised to help me when I was growing up, I would despise them because I had an innate distrust of adults, especially men. In my mind, nothing they could have done would have helped and it made me more panicked when they showed signs of desiring to help or speaking about the subject.

However, as I said before, all cases are different. In your mind, Molly may have done the wrong thing with Harry, but to others, she would have done the best that she could. Last thing I would desire to hear was that I was abused. My counsellor always stated that it was best to let the child speak about it first and not push it, but meh.

No idea, but Molly wasn't really bad about anything. I think her heart was in the right place. I mean, the last thing you do is make promises you can't keep... especially to abused kids.

**** I get what you mean, and Harry was definitely on the functional side of things (so the mopey suicide Angst stories are definitely just an OC with Harry's name). And I'm definitely not expecting Molly to act like a therapist. But her not calling the bobbies is a criminal offence where I'm from (punishable with a year in prison). And a good attorney could probably get her convicted for accessory to child abuse for the food she had sent (instead of informing the relevant authorities).

I think it's mostly a case of Rowling not realising the implications of something she wrote. If a random stranger in Diagon Alley pulled that whole act, it wouldn't matter. But because Harry (at least somewhat) trusted Mrs Weasley, her empty promises were in the position to really hurt him. But maybe that's just my personal experience with my parents making these kind of empty promises talking.

And I'm definitely not expecting the authors to write an 100% accurate representation of abuse, mostly because each case is different (nor do I want to read stories where it's the main point), but far too often it doesn't have any impact on Harry whatsoever, not even anxiety or minor insecurities.

***** I apologise. I did not intend to make it seem like I was disregarding your point.

At most, Harry displayed an intense mistrust for adults and that was about all that he got from it that we saw. However, a lot of things like that don't manifest. His disregard for the rules and jumping headlong into danger could also be seen as a trait that can be attached to childhood abuse, but it all does really depend. Anything could tie to it, and it makes it all up to the author. I, however, cannot see Harry being suicidal about the abuse. It would need to be something major to turn him to suicide. By his third-year, he was tackling Dementors, something that most of us would stumble on.

Third-year also proved that he wasn't really too badly affected by the abuse. My Boggart would most like be my father.

I laughed at bobbies. That amused me.

But no, I agree. She /should/ have done so much more and not been so passive, but what I cannot name a single adult that I know that would have done anything else. After thinking on it, I can see your point.

If I received a care package of food as a kid, I would have been that if the person knew I was being starved and sent me food, why didn't they do more to get me away? I think it would cause me so much anxiety and stress I wouldn't behave right. “They care for me enough to give me food, but not help me?” would be the main thought I would suffer, along with, “They don't want me to taint their house.”

But I do see your point. And I agree with your last statement. He would be obviously affected by the whole thing, whether in anger, anxiety, panic, or even a calm acceptance of certain things.

Reminds me when I read gay Harry stories and he bursts into tears randomly in his fourth-year because Draco offended him. Like, okay.

But I disagree here. Besides Dementors being the one thing stopping you from the magical afterlife, they make you relive the worst things that happened to you. Dementors are an existential horror, probably the vilest creatures in the entire series.

So not only are they highly dangerous, they torture you with the worst that has happened to you. Any magical child could kill an adult after their first year in Hogwarts, but the best you can ever learn against dementors is a repellant (or Fiendfyre, but that's another can of worms).

******* I meant Boggart, not Dementor. I was writing about Dementors in the chapter I'm writing and things just did not click.

That was my bad! Somehow, even after re-reading it, it never clicked that I mixed up Dementors and Boggarts. Damn lesson where Harry's Boggart turned into a Dementor. I blame that! :)

Edit: I think we both got confused.

******** I think that anyone's boggart would become a dementor if they really thought about it. Those things (both boggarts and dementors) are seriously fucked up and should honestly be purged with the fires of hell (Fiendfyre).
