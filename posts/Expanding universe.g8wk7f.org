*** I already know about Northumbrian, in fact my question started from that author. I wanted to know if there was someone else who has done such work as the Northumbrian's work..... I wrote it in my first post but you didn't read it all, I guess

Thank you for answer anyway üôèüòä, you are just one of three who did it.

I guess, maybe, theee aren't so many authors who expanded the harry Potter world from book 7 without changing the canon story.

If you know something else, please let me know!

#+begin_quote
  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.
