  Sirius was laughing. "Have you always been this funny?" he asked, an odd expression on his face. I shrugged. "Well, you know what they say. You have to watch the quiet ones." He muttered something under his breath that sounded like "Clearly."

  She was dramatic. He was dynamic. She was precise. He was impulsive. He was James, and she was Lily, and one day they shared a kiss, but before that they shared many arguments, for he was cocky, and she was sweet, and matters of the heart require time.

  Lonely and outcast by his classmates, Remus wishes on a moonshadow for a friend who understands him. To his amazement his wish is answered not once, but three times, by his former enemies, the Marauders. SBRL and some JPLE as well, of course.

** There is a Marauders' era [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/73d3wd/best_marauderera_fics_wiki/][section]] in the list of frequent recommendation.

I really enjoyed linkffn(Not Fade Away) despite its abandonment. Slide's depiction of muggleborn-pureblood relations captured the casual 'blood-ism', both at Hogwarts and outside, along with the systemic bigotry in a manner that I find tremendously realistic in both its depth and breadth.

Both canon and original characters were well written. The familiar characters were characterized similar enough to the stereotypical to feel familiar but distinct enough to stand out.

** Anything by Queen Nightingale (her work is poetry, but mostly one-shots) Linkffn(An Unexpected Attraction by NJRM) - sort of long/draggy, but I remember liking it Linkffn(Buried Treasure and Transmogrify)\\
Linkffn(A Burnt Marshmellow by drwatsonn) - Remus/OC, a lot of Marauder though Linkffn(Fog and Fire by MaMaquillerie) - not Jily-centric, but has Jily and I like how they're written

  Lily Evans has spent years despising James Potter. He has spent just as long worshiping her. When seventh year pairs them Head Boy and Girl, each comes to realize that their judgment isn't quite what they thought it was. This is the same story that was over on Checkmated, but I completed it here. Prequel to Heroes for Ghosts. Warning: this story is a strong M rating.
