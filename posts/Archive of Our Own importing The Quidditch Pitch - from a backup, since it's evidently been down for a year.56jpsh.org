** I think this is great news. The original host is cooperating to migrate the stories to an equally-open site, and trying to make contact with the original authors so that they can provide info on existing accounts or veto the move.

It's a real search & rescue operation. They're even trying to rehost the original story links to redirect to the new Ao3 postings.

** AO3 Open Doors is a godsend for fandom. There's tons of smaller archives which would simply disappear unless rescued this way. (grangerenchanted being one of the unfortunate examples.)

*** Oh, yes, I'm always happy to see these notices. I'll continue posting all the HP ones here so everyone knows. Such regrets for archives from my earlier fandoms which are too long gone to be imported.

And I always donate to Ao3's funding drives, because lord knows I get my money's worth out of them.

** This is awesome. i wonder how old the backup is and how much was lost. It'll suck, but nearly as much as losing the whole thing sucked.
