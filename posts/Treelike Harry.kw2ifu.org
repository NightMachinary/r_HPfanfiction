** I mean, I can understand what you're getting at, but there's also a reason being called 'slow' is also a synonym for 'stupid' mentally.

It doesn't matter how smart you /might/ be, if you can only address the first point in a conversation, and even then only once it's over.

Its just... Completely pointless in real life?

Maybe Harry would be able to respond to someone after a night to think about it, but being mentally crippled for the whole day because he can't respond to anything fast enough just feels youvd be making him dumb.

Maybe treelike Harry would work in a society of trees, but in a story where he has to interact with humans I don't see this as being a good trait for him, at all.
