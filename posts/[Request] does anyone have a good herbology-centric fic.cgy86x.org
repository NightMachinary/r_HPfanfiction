I'm looking for a fic that focuses a lot on hebology. Not necessarily making herbology super powerful, just something with a lot of hebology in it, like Nevile gardening while he processes things. Or herbology can be totally OP, I just want something that has a lot of it going on.

  Luna would never tell Neville to plant something dangerous in his garden...would she?

** We can see Harry employing Herbology in linkffn(11115934), it's not exactly a central point to the story though. Still a very good fic.

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.
