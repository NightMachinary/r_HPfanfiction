Hi, i mostly read the romance genre, i read all ships but mostly harry/fleur and harry/tonks.

If your interested here are some of my recommendations: All it takes is one girl (ao3) by stevenTLawson

The international tri wizard tournament (ao3/ffn) by salient_causality

Whispers into the night (ffn) by jean 11089


** linkffn(The green in the grey; summer of change) - These are my two favorite Harry/Tonks fics

linkffn(Cadmean Victory; letters; ingenio ab artifex) - My favorite Harry/Fleur

linkffn(soul scars; harry potter and the rune stone path; price of being noble) - these are all Harry/multi since both of the fics your rec'd that I've read are Harry/multi

linkffn(grow young with me; ten more minutes; behind blue eyes; novocaine) - these are assorted other romance I enjoy, mostly Harry/OC except Novocaine which is Harry/Daphne

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
