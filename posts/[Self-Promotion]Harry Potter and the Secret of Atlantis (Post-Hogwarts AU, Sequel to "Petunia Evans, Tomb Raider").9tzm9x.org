*** Not OP, but can explain.

Harry is wondering why Hermione's hair is made of overcooked ramen and Ron is doing the Fortnite default dance.

Hermione is looking at the skull of Ę̷̭̝͔̲͚̀͘M̶̷̨̲̜͉̘͎͈̖͖̳͕͙̙͘͝ͅÍ̟̞͖̬̫̼͓̟̫̞͜ͅN̵̸̤̩̹͉̤̠̞͕͉̘̮̜̘͇̙͖̕͜E̸̮͈̟̬̮̲̱̺̣̳̙M͚͓̠̝̼͙͓̤̳͓͇̺̫͓͔̲͢͢͡ͅ, lord of rhymes from the 2nd Century AD. Hope that answers your question.

Edit: Alternatively, [[http://imgur.com/a/Q5980Ga][Ron knew he had to do it to em]].

**** Thanks! That clears a lot up. I think I've figured out the symbolism of all this.

The white clothes worn by Ron are representative of his inherent moral superiority, as contrasted Harry's pitch black tracksuit. By doing this, Ron can prove that no, he did not buy those vbucks with his mother's credit card.

When Harry stares into Hermione's hair, this is the moment where he reaches an epiphany. Harry's vision is drowned by a mess of tangled hair. Drowning involves water. Baptism involves water. Therefore, Harry is being baptised by Hermione's hair, and brings back the inherent goodness taken away by the black tracksuit.

Hermione's outfit is a symbol of her own independence, but also the fact that she is a slave to her own ideologies. She makes a statement against the objectification of women by objectifying herself willingly without realising her own hypocrisy. However, this voluntary objectification is also symbolic of her empowerment, as she does it to herself outside of the traditional restrictions placed upon her by the patriarchy.

The vines that obscure the viewer's vision of the character can only represent one thing: Viet Cong guerrillas. This is evidently a protest by the artist against the sheer senseless of all of the participants in the Vietnam War, and how it indirectly led to the development and release of Fortnite Battle Royale.

The skull ties all the symbolism together. When Hermione discovers the work of this so called ancient poet, her own bubble of delusion she hides in gets torn apart. She sees the world around her in a whole new lens and realises, remembering the wise poet's passage "mom's spaghetti", that she should not maintain a hairstyle that resembles a lump overcooked noodles.

  AU. Having been raised by his tomb raiding aunt, Harry Potter had known early on that he'd follow in her footsteps and become a Curse-Breaker, discovering and exploring old tombs full of lost knowledge and treasure. But he and his two best friends might have underestimated just how dangerous the wrong sort of knowledge and treasure could be. Sequel to "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider".

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
