Hey guys,

I'm looking for a fic where Harry Potter ends up getting switched with a Harry Potter from a different dimension and/or from the future during the department of mysteries battle. I most remember that we see a different Harry Potter being brought to the canon universe in the midst of the battle. The new Harry has also been betrayed/is dark/etc.


** Is this it? Only, I don't remember him being betrayed. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6763981/1/The-Dark-Lord-s-Equal][The Dark Lord's Equal]].

  Years after the Epilogue things look bleak; Harry Potter agrees to go back to the Ministry Battle to change history for the better. Premise; "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think. Fight scenes, humour, romance, magic, and insanity. FINISHED
