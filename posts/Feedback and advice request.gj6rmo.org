My first attempt at any writing. Tried to rationalise the beginning of PS with Hagrid (who cannot magically defend himself) being first (Sirius turned up independently) on the scene to an attack which left two capable fighters dead, and deciding to take Harry to the Dursleys directly. Occam's razor: nobody knew what was going on. Critique of style and interpretation sought.

Also would people be interested in a continuation in a similar vein of canon events with (at least up to book 5, where all logic leaves the building) with a well-meaning Dumbledore who does go to others for help when appropriate, but is a scholar at heart, not a polititian or warrior, so is legitimately out of his depth.

Edit: Sorry, forgot to put the link in :[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13583563/1/Once-Upon-a-Hallowe-en]]


** That's an interesting point actually. How did Hagrid know to go to the Dursleys? Well. It's possible Sirius contacted Dumbledore about the Potters' death, and Dumbledore sent Hagrid to get Harry while he went ahead with McGonagall to secure the street at Little Whinging.

And then, after settling the situation with Harry, Sirius gifts his motorbike to Hagrid because he knows he's probably going to Azkaban forever for this, but he feels like he absolutely has to avenge his friends by murdering Peter, which, you know. Doesn't end up really working out for him, though the end was the same.

Not sure if this analysis is what you were looking for, but those are my thoughts.

*** Interesting idea, Sirius planning to go suicide run agianst Peter. Have actually posted the link now, which should make what I meant clearer.

  Hagrid (who cannot magically defend himself) being first

Hagrid's umbrella has or is a wand, and while he is legally not allowed to possess or use it, that doesn't appear to stop him in canon. Furthermore, as a half-giant, he has significant innate magic resistance.

*** He probably is more dangerous that most would credit him, especially in an enclosed enviroment with his physically strength, but even if it wasn't Voldemort, wouldn't sending he against a group that could kill and ex head boy and girl and practiced resistance fighters be foolish.

**** The order is perpetually shorthanded, so Hagrid may have been the least bad option.

** This event is where a lot of the manipulative/evil Dumbledore stories get some of their justification. Remember that Hagrid stated that he was told to bring Harry to Dumbledore. That means that Dumbledore knew something had happened to the Potters and rather than going himself he sent Hagrid.

So this implies that Dumbledore was monitoring the Godrics Hollow house and when the attacks occurred rather than the "only wizard that Voldemort fears" showing up to protect/help the Potters he sends Hagrid who was kicked out of school (eg did not finish his education) and only had his broken wand in his umbrella (which suggests that he could only do less powerful spells eg he wouldn't be able to magically battle any deatheaters).

It is never explained how Dumbledore knew that something happened nor why he didn't go himself instead of sending Hagrid.
