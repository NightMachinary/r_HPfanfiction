*** Agreed. But then there's plenty of recced fics that I just couldn't get into... it could also be a bit of personal preference - maybe we're just pickier?

*** I tried Of A Linear Circle a couple of times and couldn't get into it; then I decided to give it one more try and LOVED it. Maybe I needed the downtime of the pandemic to really get into it, LOL.
