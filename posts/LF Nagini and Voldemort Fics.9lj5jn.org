The â€˜Nagini was a human' reveal from the latest Fantastic Beasts trailer has me in the mood to read more about the possible relationships between the two of them.

I'd prefer a story where Nagini is/was a human, but at the very least, I want her to be intelligent and not just focused on food all the time. Bonus if it explores the effects of the horcrux between them.
