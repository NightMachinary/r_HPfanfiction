:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I also seem to remember (but it might be a different fix) where Harry is able to pop like an elf and is able to stay in the "void" between. He's unable to hear what people are saying but is able to leave something like a dicta quill to write down what they are saying to spy on them. (but that might be from a different fic).

Been trying to find this now for sometime...

Hopefully someone can come through :)


** I personally only know of one fic where Harry can pop and it isnt this one but that sounds interesting
