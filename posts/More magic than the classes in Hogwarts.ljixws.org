So I've been thinking is there more to magic than normal? I mean like there's always the same 12 or 13 classes in fanfic if you're lucky maybe Harry self-studies Healing and Alchemy but i want more than normal, maybe Harry accidentally enters the Elves and Fae dimension where he learns blood magic, druid magic, ritualistic magic, soul magic(horocrux is such a joke to be really soul magic) , REAL Necromancy (fuckin inferi is a joke, where are the liches, the summoning of spirits to gain information? Bringing people back to fight for you?) hell even learn how to focus his magic without a wand


** Making a horcrux basically makes you a lich. Just need to find a way to make the reanimation automatic.

It's a Warcraft crossover, Harry meets a Blue dragon. Learns new magic, sets Albus on fire even before he follows in the footsteps of Zeus and Thor.

I think my fic might be what you're looking for? Not 100% sure what you wanted.

  HP/Warcraft crossover with no knowledge of Warcraft needed. Harry in his 5th year could have used a few friends with actual combat experience. A lot of folks on Azeroth during Cataclysm would have been better off anywhere else. If you think HP cannon needed more Dragons, this is the fic for you! Features HP/HG/? Ship and a Cursed!Dumbledore.
