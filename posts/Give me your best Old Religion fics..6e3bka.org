Like ones wizards and witches practices before Christianity. Purebloods tend to practice them more.

Generally the ones I've read have some Paganistic themes to them.


** So, one of my two favorite fics spends some time on the magical religion, and it isn't the faux-Pagan stuff we tend to see.

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret. In the meantime, Chief-wizard Malfoy has his eyes set on Hogwarts, and only Sir Albus stands in his way.

** in the perfectly normal series some pure bloods still follow their religion in secret but its worship is looked down upon because Grindelwald and Voldemort followed it.

*** One thing that I hate about canon Harry Potter is his desire to be normal. I think, dude, you're literally a prophesied child living in a magical society- the Dursleys were "normal" and he hated them... It just didn't make sense, and it wasn't an appealing character trait. Normalcy just isn't very exciting or simulating. I think I speak for the vast majority of people when I say that they consume media because the situations and characters are abnormal.

It looks like the author can write well, and there's a lot of words... But I'm afraid I'm hesitant to try it. A more appealing and (potentially) inspiring story would be someone who wants to be normal, but gradually comes into his own- and with a mystical magical world, the possibilities for what that is are endless.

I want to know, does he ever get over that desire in this fic? Does he excel? Or will this be a continuous theme, as I assume?

**** I've been thinking about an AU story, post-Voldemort, where Harry attributed the defeat of Voldemort to Dumbledore (who died in the battle), hiding his own deeds, so he wouldn't have to deal with (even more) fame - only to later run into a number of problems for himself and his friends which he could have solved easily, had he been known as the wizard who defeated Voldemort.

**** He always desires to be perceived as normal because he was accused of cheating by the dursleys when he did well in school and later snape did the same. This harry adapted to the dursleys abuse much more than canon harry and actually convinced them to treat him humane(but still inappropriate for a child) this harry is mich smarter than in canon and a lot more cunning he also used his fame to get what he wants and is also close friend with some slytherins. This harry is slowly starting hold less back in class and is becoming more comfortable with the attention he gets

I think he has no problem with attention (like for his Quidditch skills) and more with the fact that to most people in the magical world are insensitive gits about it.

** I've had British Wizards follow a pagan religion in "Patron", but since they only "returned to their roots" after turning away from Christianity following the Statue of Secrecy and the witch hunts, it's more like what 17th early 18th century people thought paganism was like. Most of them are as religious as modern West Europeans, i.e. not much if at all, even if they celebrate yuletide and such, and at Hogwarts the old gods are called upon for a blessing when a new school year starts. There are the "Faithful" in Britain as well, but they are a minority. Religion doesn't play a crucial role in the story, though.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
