Recently devoured "Harry Potter and Future's Past" .... its awesome. ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5664828/1/Harry-Potter-and-Future-s-Past]] )

im looking for something similar.. ;)

bonus points would be

- harry/hermione (but not a must... tho id like that a couple or atleast one part of em gets thrown back and starts things earlier?)
- the manipulative forces (aka dumb'n friends) get thrown out of their own game

havnt read any timetravel related fics other than the one i posted yet... so feel free to recommend hidden gems ;)

There is even a weak underpinning of H/Hr in there, ;). The romance is light in this one , but in a good way

**** Storyboarding was fun, and then trying to write stuff made me remember how much I absolutely loathe writing. Flashbacks to Thesis. And that was that ;)

** linkffn(8076284) honestly, i got a bit bored, not a big fan of canon pairings, i've liked a couple of Harry/Ginny, and I absolutely detest Hermione, except future war Hermione, like on "Ragnarok" or "Too Far from Home" Hermione's. Hell, even the one from "The Other Boy Who Lived" was a better Hermione than the usual.
