** For a canon-esque feel, I tend to imagine it based on my own school experience. You'll know the smart ones by how easily they understand things, they may look bored after a fashion. They're the type everyone knows; ‘never study but ace the exam types' or at least you never see them study, which means they are efficient. For a canon reference, this is how I interpret James Potter, Sirius Black and probably the twins. I went to school with a lot of these people.

There are also the smart ones that ‘fly under the radar'. Not the ridiculous ‘I've got to hide my intelligence to not draw attention to myself' I've seen in fanfic, which does not make any sense, example, Tom Riddle flew under the radar by playing a ‘perfect' façade, which is practically more effective than ‘hiding'. I digress; These smart ones are the ones that put themselves on the sidelines but maintains high marks, they just either don't get involved eith other things, are introverted or a ‘loner'. A canonical interpretation would be Snape, or at least how I imagine he was.

There's the legitimate geniuses, like Albus ‘Did things with a wand, I'd never seen before' Dumbledore, the ones who could go anywhere and do anything and likely already have. Tom Riddle would also fit into this category.

The key link between these three categories, is that they make whatever they do, look effortless. That is the mark of a prodigy, because the ‘basics' are so far beneath their notice.

There is then what I would call the ‘lesser smart' people. People like Hermione and to an extent Harry and Ron, whom I think realistically would have done better than we're shown. I put Hermione here, because she's ‘book-smart and for the amount of effort and she feels she needs to put in. She doesn't make it look effortless.

*** When it comes to magical knowledge, Hermione is foremost among Harry's generation. But throughout canon, we consistently see Harry perform the spells that take the most raw power (imperius, cruciatus, patronus in y3, long distance summoning charm). Dumbledore is an example of the combination of the 2, incredibly intelligent with a drive to learn and no power bottleneck.

*** The "make it look effortless" heuristic is an interesting one, but Hermione is a weird case in which just because it doesn't look effortless doesn't mean that it isn't (relatively) effortless. This is because she is a workaholic who studies far past the point of diminishing returns but doesn't have the insight to realise it, and seeks validation from adults and formal examinations.

Contrast that attitude with that of the Weasley Twins (who, contrary to what you wrote, actually earned only 3 OWLs each): they have their goal (joke shop), and so they put in massive amounts of effort towards it, while pretty much ignoring everything else, including (and especially) what the grown-ups want.

******* Interesting. If this were later, it would be evidence of "effortlessness" indeed; but this comment had to have come before Ron had a chance to observe them at Hogwarts, and so it seems to me like a natural progression: once they had their goal, the twins stopped studying anything else, and started failing.

******** However then you get into the fallacy that an exam, especially one like the OWL or NEWT is an accurate guideline for intelligence, which it isn't really. Yes, intelligent people will tend to do well on exams but it's not always the case. Personally, I got the impression, that the Twins failed because they weren't interested in what the school was teaching. In Half-Blood Prince, I believe that Hermione even remarks that their patented daydream charms are a piece of ‘extraordinary' magic.

There are a few fics where it's stated that the twins failed their exams on purpose so their mother couldn't bully them into taking boring Ministry jobs, since they wouldn't have good enough grades to be accepted. I've adopted that as my headcanon.

** u/Ash_Lestrange:
#+begin_quote
  How do you describe a Magical Prodigy?
#+end_quote

Subtle with the ability to understand magic beyond what's in a book and an imagination that fills in the blanks.

"Doing things with a wand never seen before" or, in other words, performing standard spells in a way the average wizard can't. Dumbledore banished Harry's trunk in Surrey and it was at the burrow in blink. He conjured hundreds of sleeping bags at once. Harry wasn't a prodigy, but his patronus was significantly better than almost everyone else's.

Mastering advanced magic is cool and impressive, but I believe canon makes it clear that's not the (only) mark of an advanced wizard.

  Would they be able to outduel 7th Years in First Year?
#+end_quote

No. In fact, they should be as outclassed as any other first year.

** The dueling aspect of your question intrigues me. I think about defeating a 7th year in terms of basketball. Could an 11 year old LeBron James beat an average 17 year old in a game of one-on-one? Maybe? I think a lot would depend on his physical development up to that point. The first whispers of real talent would be there, but the physical gap could be too great. Him at 12 or 13, with time to grow? He's beating the vast majority of older kids. At 17 he's destroying all but maybe the elite of the elite.

The fic Harry Potter and the Ashes of Chaos does a really good job of following this same mentality. Harry is recognized as a prodigy in the story (and is shown to be one through multiple strong examples - kudos to the author), but as a first year he gets absolutely worked in duels with older kids. As he goes on though, and he puts in incredible amounts of effort, you start to see him get a leg up on people he really has no business beating. It's well done, and you can believably look at Harry at his current age in the story (second year) and know that when he's a seventh year he will have no peer, and in fact be one of the greatest to come through the school.

** To me, it would be knowledge beyond that of a first year, maybe Riddle has already mastered several first charms and spells and has already become knowlegdeable on 2nd and 3rd year spells. Or maybe he has read about several curses and mastered them.

I dont think a 1st year should be able to outduel a 7th year, but maybe them just doing better than expected but still losing would showcase prodigious talent.

If its Riddle then maybe advanced ability in Potions, Charms, and DADA. Portray him as if you're writing an evil Hermione, incredibly smart and knowlegdable but with more of a cunning, charismatic and sinister side to him.

** Different levels

Weasley twins/marauders/Snape: curriculum is mostly easy and boring, the real challenge is in their own projects

Voldemort/ Grindelwald: effortlessly master normal magic and move up to arcane magic that would scare others (horcruxes and whatever it was that got gellert kicked out of durmstrang) Plus Tom had the whole controlled accidental magic thing

Dumbledore doing things with a wand no one has ever seen before.

** The easiest way to show a characters talent is to compare them to their classmates. It's way too common in fanfiction to see first years casting spells like accio and vanishing objects. Canonically these spells are hard to learn for /upper years,/ which makes it stupid for every single friend of the main character to learn them. Realistically a magical prodigy would be one who easily completes spells their classmates struggle with, while working harder to learn spells above their year.

Then there is the discussion of what degree of talent they have, so I thought it would be fun to make a few categories:

First category: Students that learn all the spells in class during the year and stay top of class. They enjoy learning spells outside of the curriculum and might study OWL-level spells in third-fourth year and occasionally succeed. Studying and being a general bookworm is common in this category. People in this category often become powerful wizards/witches. Examples for this category would be: Hermione Granger, Percy and Bill Weasley.

Second category: Students that intuitively succeed with magic, often on the first try. They are often bored with the curriculum and learn magic outside of the curriculum. These students might learn nonverbal magic in their fifth year or earlier. They learn spells that most would consider impossible for their age. These students can match adult wizards in their later years at Hogwarts, and will become exceptionally powerful adult wizards/witches. Examples: James Potter, Sirius Black and Severus Snape.

Third category: The student will learn a new spell on the first try. Every class is easy and they spend most of their time studying more difficult magic. They could probably ace their OWLs as second or third years. They will learn more about magic before completing Hogwarts than most wizards ever will. They will be remembered in history books for their exceptional talent. Examples: Tom Riddle and Albus Dumbledore.

Now after all this we get the average student. I think fanfiction writers should include more characters with average magical talent, because it will make it easier to put talent into perspective. The average student will have a subject they're particularly good at but will still struggle. They experience the normal school stress about handing in essays and not being able to master spells in time. OWL results would include mostly As and some EEs sprinkled in. Most adult wizards are in this category.

** depends on what type of prodigy, is it a generational one like Hermione James Sirius and Snape, or is it a exceptional one like Geller Albus and Tom. The former will maybe be a year ahead in their 4th year, eg Hermione doing owl level work in year 4.

Tom Albus and Gellert, in the magic they are interested in, could probably take their newts and ace them as of their 4th or 5th year, depending on their work ethic, they are that much above the ordinary wizards aswell as regular prodigies

** Depends. AFAIK, prodigies (as opposed to the merely gifted) usually show it from a very young age---definitely before 11. Tom Riddle's conscious and sophisticated control of Accidental Magic marks him as a prodigy, for example.

If the story starts at Hogwarts, I'd probably go with something like early-canon Hermione: first touches a wand in July at the earliest, and figures out how to do all of the first-year spells by September from the books alone, while also memorising a bunch of history books.

After that, though, it depends on the demands of the storyline and the personality and the values of the character.

** I feel like it really depends on your definition of prodigy, or at least, what kind are they? Like you can have someone who's amazingly book smart but is terrible with people skills. Or they're Fantastic at quidditch but can hardly get through charms. Another thing to keep in mind is that being smart isn't a replacement for wisdom/years lived. I'd say that they wouldn't be able to outduel a 7th year, but they'd maybe know more spells than the average first year and could pick them up more quickly. Not necessarily on the first try, but once they got the feel for certain types of spells it wouldn't take nearly as long to learn them. Maybe they're able to grasp at their magic a lot more intuitively than others their age. And as for finding school easy, maybe? I wouldn't call myself a prodigy but I was in the "gifted program" growing up, and while I picked up on things quickly I struggled with getting my homework done on time and so my grades were more average even though I tested well

And, once I reread your question I realized you were asking about Tom riddle. I didn't have him in mind when answering, but I hope this still helps!
