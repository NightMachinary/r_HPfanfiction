I'm looking for fics similar to Poison Pen. I just absolutely loved this story, and crave more.

Over 70k words please!


** linkffn(Celestial Requim) should match your tastes if you're into that sort of stuff. Honestly, its not for me, but from the looks of it you might enjoy it, so have fun.

Edit: Its actually not over 70k, so sorry about that.

  Harry, much more cynical and worn from 5th year, wants to be heard without discrimination. He wants to learn how to deal with Voldemort on his own, being the best that he can be without conforming society's mold for him. Enter the writer, Harrison Evans
