I have noticed there aren't many fics about Ron's being obviously the forgotten son and Ginny being the favorite. When Ron's problems are addressed in fanfics they usually either portray him as an ungrateful brat, because god forbid a child complain about being neglected, or they are never explored, just like in the books. So do you guys know any fic that shows this in a well written way?


** There are parts in linkffn(11191235) Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin, but it is then justified a bit. The problem is that the Weasley family is so inconsistent that you can make them out to be just about anything. On the one hand they are so poor that Ron can't afford his own wand and they have a handful of coins total in their vault, but then they blow most of 700 galleons on a single holiday and the entire family have their personal good quality, if not cutting edge, brooms for quidditch. They are relatable everymen, but his father is a department head and his older brothers include two head boys, a Quidditch captain and the twins who outperformed decades of professional R&D by other joke shops while still in school. Even Molly outduelled Bellatrix.

If you want to complain about Ron getting unfairly treated blame JKR. She sets him up as an 'average' relatable figure, then keeps raising the bar. In the books he doesn't underachieve, but from Hermione to Harry's patronus to Snape's potions book to the Marauders' animagus transformations to Barty Crouch Junior's exam results to his own brother, everyone else overperforms, constantly raising the bar until poor Ron is left at the bottom, losing out to 'power creep' effectively.

**** I sometimes think of them as people who are so bad at managing their own money. There are people like that in real life. They would scrimp on the daily necessities because they really are poor but would splurge on useless things whenever a huge amount of money came instead of saving it.

I also sometimes wonder if this was one of the factors that made Percy distance himself from the family after he got a better position in the Ministry. Maybe he wanted to change his outlook on life and money by hanging out with a different crowd. After all, this is something motivational speakers often talk about - to change your mindset, you have to change your environment. Too bad that it was a bad crowd that he got into.

Speaking of Percy, here's a story that somehow talks about the dynamics in the Weasley family. It involves next gen characters. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8035006/1/The-Noticing-of-Lucy-Weasley]]

More like turned a 1v3 into a 1v4 and got one good shot in. I mean, kudos to her for being the only sane defender and using the killing curse, but that was hardly an impressive feat.

The fandom loves to give Neville the role of "Ron, but /better/"

What? Molly cleared the three girls out of the way before dueling Bellatrix. It was a 1v1 battle.

***** It was not a duel, it was one spell. And unless Molly yeeted the girls out of the castle, they were still there, as were some 50 other defenders (that scene is Voldemort and Bellatrix vs the remaining defenders).

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
