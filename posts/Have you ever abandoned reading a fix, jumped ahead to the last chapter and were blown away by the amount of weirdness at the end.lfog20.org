I often do this, I try to give fics a chance but sometimes, even 10-20 chapters in I have to stop and abandon reading it. I then go to the last 1-3 chapters and just read. It's so weird what comes out, especially stuff that might make sense when slowly getting there chapter by chapter but then you end up with Bellatrix giving birth to Harry's child, who just ate a God and is a timelord. Or you have completely AU characters wayyy off from what you started and suddenly the characters are taking down the evil Atlantis. Or suddenly you have Ron with pocket tanks who just took down the magical government together with Harry and Hermione who have even more badass gear.

What's the craziest thing you encountered? And has it ever managed to pull you back in?


** A few times when the fic is extremely long and the plot is just barely moving.

*** yeah kinda. Honestly it became too much for me a couple of chapters in. Love time travel and redoing stuff but it became stupid quite early. And the whole premise of dying to relive things was discarded too quickly. Then went to the end and everything was unrecognizable

*** That's a fic that I feel like you can't read too fast. It was one of the first fanfics I read, and I recall just blitzing through. I also recall that by the time I got to the end I had no idea what was going on. Going to have to do a reread before I start on Heartlands.

** Golden Bullets. It started so well, but the characterization got weird in the middle. So I skipped to the end, and apparently the entire world had gone to shit except for Draco Malfoy. So yeah, I quit.

** I usually read the final chapter just so I can make an educated guess which kind of story it's going to be.

I've encountered a story where the final chapter is a long conversation between a succubus and another OC character, one where Harry's getting complained at for "could you please stop breaking all of reality?" by an alien, and quite a few that might as well have ended with [[https://i.imgur.com/K3WOASL.png][the Yelling Bird meme]].

I haven't felt that I have wasted my time since forever: all the weird stuff I haven't started reading in the first place. Recommended.

** Mistakes and Second Chances.

So basically FemHarry was escorting old dead Hermione and I was like wha? There was a conversation about her still being too young with Ginny. (Her wife). Harry said it was always supposed to be this way.

I skipped ahead because I wanted to see if this ended in a blood bath or not.

If you are going to read it please heed the tags. Their important.
