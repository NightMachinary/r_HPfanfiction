** The writer has started to upload the story on Wordpress and looks like she's rewriting and continuing it. You have to ask permission to see it but she's pretty good at allowing access. Very happy that she has decided to return to it as it was one of my favourite stories. [[https://nocturnememory.home.blog/]]
