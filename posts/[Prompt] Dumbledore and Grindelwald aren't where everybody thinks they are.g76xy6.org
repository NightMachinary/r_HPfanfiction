Grindelwald, despite his best efforts, was losing the war on both magical and muggle fronts. Then along comes Dumbledore, his naive, idealistic former lover. Who proceeds to try to win a duel against him. Him, who has the Elder Wand, which can't be lost in a duel.

​

He sees an out. He switches places and imprisons Dumbledore in his place, altering both their apearances to match.

​

Time for a fresh start. He works his way into the ICW, the Wizingamot and Hogwarts. Now all he has to do is to manipulate all his fresh new pawns. For the Greater Good, of course.


** I've actually seen this happen in a really cringy Indy!Harry haphne(or harem, cant remember) fic. The fic itself was enjoyable in the same way all other fics like that are, but the Grindelwald reveal come out of absolutely nowhere. Like, one moment Dumbledore is being bashed for being a "manipulative old coot", next he is screaming "NEIN! NEIN! FOR THE GREATER GOOD!" in the middle of the Great Hall. It was fucking great.

** This sounds like a really interesting concept. Having Harry discover the truth at some point could lead to a much more nuanced Second Wizarding War, with Harry attempting to hunt the horcruxes whilst also staying under Grindelwald's radar.

Or you could even go for a much greyer Voldemort who discovered this long ago and has been resisting ever since.

maybe during the war against grindaldore

tom gave into his worst instincts

******** That could work. If the Potters are never targeted, then Snape would be a Riddle loyalist and the story could be about the “Death Eaters” (whether they are the same set of pure bloods in canon or not) trying to kidnap or convert Harry so that Tom can train him to fulfil the prophecy, which is actually about Grindelwald.

And Snape wouldn't tell “Dumbledore” about it.

********* Or the Dark Lord in the prophecy is actually Grindledore, and so he manufactures the Potter's deaths. Tom tries to stop it but is too late to save James and Lily, he and Grindledore face off, Harry gets wounded in the crossfire (the scar), Tom gets it even worse and has to flee, barely clinging to life. Grindledore goes to finish Harry off, notices Lily's sacrifice has done something weird, and rather than risk it, decides to use Harry as a propaganda tool.

I'll admit there's definitely holes in the above, and you need to stretch things to make them fit, but there may be a way of making it work.

********* Considering what we know about the potters its highly likely that tom went to school with one or was introduced to them by his mentor dumbledore, due to the potters skill with potions and similar politics

so maybe tom already knew James and the others from when they where young, perhaps warning fleamont about grindalwalds intrest in the hallows and how he had replaced dumbledore.

Fleamont still sends James to school with an invisibility cloak, just not the family one.

The minister definitely has too much power, but I think that more than just him had to be corrupt for this all to happen. Or maybe not and Wizarding Britain is just in a very sad state.

** Reveal at the end of Harry's fifth year in the department of ministries. That's why "Dumbledore" was avoiding harry because he didnt want Voldy to know that he was in fact Grindlewald. We know that Tom Riddle was in Hogwarts in the 40s so it's entirely plausible that Tom knew Grindlewald during his time at Hogwarts. But also the fact that Tom could have been rejected by Grindlewald when he came to ask for the Defense Against the Dark Arts position coz he might have called Grindlewald out (possibly? Maybe?) So grindlewald didnt want to chance that. That's why when he found out that Harry might have had a link with Voldy he didnt want to be found out?
