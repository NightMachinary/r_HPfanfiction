So I'm looking for fics where Lily and/or James come back from the dead, be it by outside intervention or by themselves.

If Harry has a pairing(or is even in the story) then no slash please

Thank you!

  The blood magic used in Little Hangleton Graveyard does more than grant Lord Voldemort bodily form; it also brings Lily and James Potter back from the dead. OoTP AU but follows OoTP closely. Lily/James, Jily

** This fic has James sort of come back from the dead. James was in a muggle hospital in a coma for 14 years, comes back and hides his identity before he meets Harry.

** It takes awhile for RSP to get to the Lily Potter subplot, but it's a pretty good read.
