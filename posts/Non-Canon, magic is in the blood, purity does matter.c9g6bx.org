Okay, idea that I've had floating around for a few months.

Imagine magic like squash, or cordial. And a glass is the body of a person.

- A muggle will have a glass of water, just water.
- A squib has an extremely small drop of squash in their glass, though is mainly water.
- A muggle-born has a glass of squash, though it needs more squash, it's too thin.
- A pure-blood has a glass of squash, though it's too strong, needs more water to temper the drink with.
- But a half-blood, a half-blood has a perfect glass of squash, and is perfectly balanced.

Now, magical birth defects occur when there is too much squash in the glass, there is not any water to temper it, thus, it mutates. Some interesting defects could be:

- Extremely muscular limbs, but poor intelligence. Due to the absence of normality (For lack of a better word) the magic is confused and directs too much magic to the muscles and not enough to the brain. (In this AU world, wizards are hardier, faster, heal faster and are smarter.)
- Unable to control the magic, but the bursts of magic are extremely powerful. (Like an Obscurial.)
- Extremely intelligent, but also extremely frail. Like the first one, but the opposite.
- Extra body parts/absence of body parts. Again, due to not enough normality to temper the magic, the magic is confused and the product is severely deformed.

Oh, and all those tropey shitfics were correct, exercise is going to make you a better wizard! As the magic is literally pumped around your body like oxygen to fuel your spells, a stronger heart is going to help pump more magic out.

A note on dark magic: think of it as a poison. If you use too much of it at the start, your body will decay and eventually you will die from overuse. But, like with poisons, if you use a little bit of dark magic every day, your body will eventually get used to it and will be able to cope with the strain it places upon your body.

** There's no such thing as too little genetic diversity adversely affecting health in biology except through inbreeding. Pure-bred dogs, when their bone-structures are sufficient, are perfectly healthy specimens except when they are inbred.

"Hybrid vigour" is merely the undoing of inbreeding - it does not prove that an absence of genetic diversity in a genome is harmful, or otherwise worse than an abundance.

Include hybrid vigour in your stories if you wish, but it is an unscientific myth, so try not to perpetuate it.

**** The where would the magic originally come from? How would two muggles have enough ‘juice' to form a magical person considering how diluted any ‘juice' in them would have to be? Why do squibs exist and normal muggles? Why is the most powerful wizard of his generation (Voldemort) a half blood?

I like hypotheticals as much as the next guy, but to make something this work you pretty much have to recreate canon from the ground up.

***** I was thinking maybe squibs come into being from too much of the, in the OPs description, cordial/squash. Like I've had a chocolate bar that had so much chocolate it tasted horrible. The whole “too much of a good thing” and all. Say magical families dump squibs in the muggle world. As generations go down all that “chocolate” is diluted down. All it would take is 2 people having a kid and having the right amount of “chocolate” to make a magical kid. The most powerful wizard of the generation being a halfblood would be because even if you don't have so much “chocolate” that you're a squib, just having a bit less of that too potent stuff would still not taste good. There has to be a good balance.

****** Not just squibs either. What are they honestly going to do with those with out of control magic? They are a risk and can never really function in society, but bind their magic (maybe a judicious use of obliviate) and send them into the muggle world... Two or 3 generations later, bam, muggleborn.

******* I always thought binding magic would be considered dangerous. Something like obscurial stuff. Ya know eventually the magic breaks the binding explosively. It would explain why muggleborns magic wasn't getting bound by Voldemort/death eaters and why they don't bind people with a life sentence in Azkaban. It also explains Arianna Dumbledore.

******** I think it depends on the mythos for the binding that the author develops. I've read some stories where they state that if a muggleborn decides not to go to school their magic was bound. Others where depending on the type it can be dangerous for the one bound. It just varies based on magic lore developed.

In this premise where there are actual magic birth defects I could see them developing a way to bind the magic of those who could not control it.

********* My favored idea of binding magic would be a sink and lock idea. Or in this case just a sink. It would continually absorb the magic a person would release and get stronger because all that magic would go into the device. I'm not sure how well it would fit into a story's magical mythos though.

***** Where Magic originally came from? Your guess is as good as mine, mate. Magical Mother Goddess gifted it, sure! Muggles drank from the Holy Grail to gain magic, sure!

How muggles would have enough juice to form a muggle-born? (Okay I have a vague idea on the basics of genetics, so I'm not saying any fact here.) When a muggle copulates with another muggle, and they both have squib ancestry, the resulting muggle/-born with have both it's parents' magic combined, as magic trumps muggle.

So Muggle A and Muggle B both have squib ancestry, they both have a magical rating of 1. They have a child, Muggle C, who have a magical rating of 2, because 1+1=2. Muggle C has a child with Muggle D, who also has a magical rating of 2. The child, has a magical rating of 4, and finally has enough magic to be a muggle-born Wizard. And so on.

For a muggle-born to be born, I think they would need at least a magical rating of 4, with the strongest muggle-born having a magical rating of 6.

*** Well, with this idea with half-bloods being the ideal wizard, there wouldn't be as much of an issue. This is because any magical could copulate with a muggle, and potentially have a magical child, which would be a half-blood. With a far larger society and a larger gene pool, inbreeding wouldn't be a problem.

Also, with the half-blood's superiority. I was thinking that the muggle-born would be weaker in terms of magic, in comparison to the half-bloods and purebloods, but the pure-bloods had severely decreased dexterity with their magic, often resulting in spells going wrong, due to having pushed too much magic into the spell.

***** That... that could work actually. Perhaps a muggle wouldn't be able to be given magic, due to their body never having experienced the strain before, but a wizard could. Perhaps like poison, taking a bit each day to build up your resistance, you could transplant marrow into yourself day by day, so your body could cope with the strain.

Or maybe your magic would lash out at having a foreign magic inserted into your body. Something to take into consideration.
