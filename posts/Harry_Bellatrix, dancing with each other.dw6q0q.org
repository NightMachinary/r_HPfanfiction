I had this imagine of them embracing each other and dancing to a slow and romantic music....doesnt mean they are somehow romantical involved at this Point, but the situation forces them to get this close or serves as an alibi to be so. I dont know, what her character/Persona would be in such a fic, maybe a Gray one, so she wouldnt necessary kill someone...but the ones she target should know better thatn to make her angry.

The fic can contain both like each other, despite their doings (Harry works for the "good" ones, while Bella is an independant one, not bound to the rules by the Ministry), but more or less hide it.

It doesnt really matter, if this is AU or Canon with her surviving the War and escapes or gets imprisoned and then released. Her appearance however should not be affected as it was in Canon, while she was in Azkaban, but she should more be looking appealing.

But maybe its a Fic that contain that both absolutely dont know each other.

Either way, what really counts for me is that you know fics as in the title that have them dance with each other.


** So basically you want something about Helena Bonham Carter?

** The only fic I can think of where Harry and Bellatrix dance is linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom), though Harry is a child when it happens and there's zero romantic and/or sexual tension/subtext. Also, as a warning, it's abandoned, so that's a thing.
