I'm looking for a SS/HG fic that I cannot remember the title of. Hermione was helping Snape with a brewing project and she deals with the aftermath of his encounters with the dark lord a notable part is when the dark lord uses the dark mark to hurt Snape in inventive ways like unwanted arousal. It sounds crazy but that's the part I remember best and I really want to find it.
