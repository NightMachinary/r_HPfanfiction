:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
The first one I'm looking for she forms basically a little army where she adopts a lot of the first generation death eaters under her. Im pretty sure in this fic her animagus form is a tiger and she leaves like paw prints on them to show they were her followers or whatever. Regulus and Lucius I'm pretty sure we're some of them. I think this was a Hermione/Sirius fic but it could have also been Regulus.

The second one I think will be easier to find, Hermione goes back in time and is adopted by the Potter's. Goes by Mia. Sirius/Hermione. She ends up coming back to present era and really pisses off Molly because she has lived a whole other life already and now smokes.

Thanks in advance guys!


** The first one could be linkffn(Roundabout Destiny) by MaryRoyale?

  Hermione's destiny is altered by the Powers that Be. She is cast back to the Marauder's Era where she is Hermione Potter, the pureblood fraternal twin sister of James Potter. She retains Hermione Granger's memories, and is determined to change her brother's fate for the better. Obviously AU. Starts in their 1st year. M for language, minor violence, etc.

  When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner. *Art by Freya Ishtar*
