Hello there folks, here is my problem : I litteraly can't stand Ron bashing fics anymore.

It's not a problem when it appears in the summary, I usually avoid those fics. But I can't count how many fics I dropped, even though the idea behind the fic was really interesting, because Ron was in fact the worst human being to have ever walk upon the Earth, lazy as hell, so stupid it's a wonder he is even able to form sentences , more biggoted than Hitler and just generally a being so awful that Harry just dump him out of the blue because it was so OBVIOUS that Ron was a cocksucking scumbbag who is just interested in money and fame without wanting to actually do anything to achieve it (usually so Harry can end up with Hermione and friend with Draco the misunderstood-Pureblood Malfoy).

I hate those fics sooo much it's hard to put it into words (that and english is not my native language but whatever). It just makes me cringe.

So please I beg of you, I want to read a Ron-Centric fic that goes against this trope. Where he is a real character, where the fact that he lives in the shadows of his brothers motivates him to strive and work hard to achieve his goals despite not beeing a prodigy. Maybe ending up in Slytherin because of his ambition, but not becoming a muggleborn and baby rapist Death Eater because of it.

Thank you folks !


** Ron's generally a hero in my stories. For example, in "The Dark Lord Never Died" he's a spy for Dumbledore sent to a Wizarding Britain ruled by Lucius Malfoy.

*** Damn, that raises my interest in that fic.

I'm familiar with your stories, but never read one as yet. They're at the top of my reading list, though.

Specifically, I've wanted to read Patron for a while, but I'm kind of tentative about the whole different social dynamics in the wizarding world thing, even though that's silly, I've read completely AU stories that I liked.

**** Well, with "Patron", I wanted to create a truly "equal but different" pureblood culture - not the canon "Old England, with a few spells and Quidditch" one. So, I have Wizarding Britain be much more progressive in some areas - they consider the muggles prudes - but archaic in other areas (they still use the "Pater Familias" family concept, where children remain under the head (male or female) of the family's power until he or she dies or they get emancipated and muggleborns have such a head as patron). However, custom and social pressure changed that - most wizards and witches get emancipated and form families of their own. Only those who hope to inherit the head's position and the family fortune usually remain unemancipated - pretty much the upper class only. And while in theory, the patron has a lot of power over the muggleborn retainer, custom and social pressure means they generally don't abuse that power. And while teenagers talk a lot about the "Year of Exploration", that's just talk. The reality of it is quite a lot different and tamer.

But I wanted a society where magic is used all the time. Dishes float around the table, people summon snacks and drinks, charms of all kinds are used all the time, clothes are a status symbol - the more spells on it, the better - and also serve as protection, and so on. And I wanted other countries to be different. Different customs, views and societies.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** My series, which starts with linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn) has a lot of the features you're looking for -- Ron's chess abilities are logically progressed and relevant to the plot; Ron, along with Harry and Hermione, is sorted into Slytherin; there are politics, which become increasingly relevant as Harry, Ron, and Hermione grow older. I'm currently on the fourth in the series, and almost at the 200k mark for total word count.

While Harry and his friends try to unravel Hogwarts' various mysteries, the political tension in the Wizengamot reaches new heights as each faction conspires to control the fate of Wizarding Britain.

  Among the assets left behind by the Death Eaters, Harry Potter learns that he now owns the Chudley Cannons. And they need help getting back up and running after the war. Fortunately, Harry knows just the wizard for the job. What do you get when you mix Arithmancy and Quidditch? Hopefully, wins. (Post-War One-shot)

*** Oh man this is the fic that sold me on hp fanfics. The last couple chapters are kinda shit imo and I still don't understand how the twist works (like, didn't he work at the cafe for a while????) but everything else is just brilliant and there is just something about the way the author writes Ron and his struggles that made me sob multiple times throughout the story lol

** This is a week late so idk if you're still looking, but eh i need to unload how nice (? if you can call 'I NEED A SEQUEL' feels that) this fic is somewhere

linkao3(A Darker Shade of Red by AsILayDying)

It's a oneshot with only 6k words, I really need more but I think that's what made it work for me instead of detailing what ron did differently from canon (bc if it does i don't think i can stomach it since I'm not really a fan of dark/too edgy ff). It features Slytherin!Ron and he's best frenemies with malfoy (never thought I'd enjoy that, but i did). The story is Ron-centric but he's mostly not involved with the golden trio so sometimes it feels like he's 'looking in' to canon.

A bit of warning though, idk if you would call it bashing since this is more like how ficRon feels, but he did feel annoyed at his family since they act so prejudiced for his sorting (his dad more bc he thought he's friends with Malfoy; george fred and ginny because they were just being immature i guess?). He also joined the DE because of circumstances - not because he's too ambitious and wants to succeed in slytherin etc (his stint in there is also not detailed in the fic, so yeah it's not going to too dark territory).

I really hope there's a sequel though because ending it that way is just so... 'I can't sleep now' cruel. But the fic didn't get that much exposure in ao3 and esp with how unpopular Ron's character is in fanfics, I'm not so hopeful for that sequel :(

** One more from me I wanted to dig up: Runaway Wizard linkffn(Runaway Wizard). It's Harry centric, but Ron does show up once Harry makes it back to the wizarding world. Shows the Malfoys in a decent light as well, and wizarding culture is important in this one.\\
Was also the basis of a Ron Request I made some time ago: Stories that focus on Ron's heritage as a pureblood outside blood purity, as Weasleys and Prewetts are both implied to be old Houses.

** Haha I love your post! I also hate Ron bashing!!! I feel like over time, people's perceptions of Ron have somehow changed from Harry's awesome best friend to basically worst person on earth, and it's UGH. I think it's entirely possible that in the trio of Harry, Ron, and Hermione... most people would probably be Ron. Hell, I'd probably be Ron. Except for my hair (Hermione hair).

xD anyway, I'm going to just go ahead and throw my fic in here for your consideration, if you don't mind. Ron isn't the main character, but he features in it prominently enough, I think, in a positive light. And I've done my best to keep him true to his actual book canon character. If you wanted to check it out that would totally make my day! :)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13125917/1/Trading-Places][Trading Places]]

When a devastating attack on Hogwarts causes Harry to switch places with his on-screen counterpart, Daniyel Bluelake, Harry is thrown into an unfamiliar Muggle world where his life is just a fantasy. His job? Acting. Meanwhile, Daniyel will discover what it truly means to be a wizard as he learns to separate the magical fantasy world he's always known from its dark reality. But with Voldemort intent on Harry's murder, Dan's happy days at Hogwarts are certainly numbered, and a showdown with Voldemort seems inevitable. But what can Dan do, in Harry's place? And how high will the cost be... to switch them back?
