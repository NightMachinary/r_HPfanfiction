We know J.K. is a mastermind, but if you could change one thing about the Harry Potter series, what would it be? A pairing? A death? Someone's Sorting? Some other plot event? Would you have wanted to see more of a certain character, or hear the books from a viewpoint other than Harry's? Or do you have more than one thing? I'm interested to hear what everyone's got to say. :)


** I would change the treatment that the Slytherin House received. I do think they were unfairly portrayed in a negative light (/especially/ in the movies, but the books were guilty of this as well). Ambition is not an inherently evil trait, but I feel that Rowling implied that it is. So I would have Harry actually befriend a Slytherin or two, like how he befriended members from the other three houses. I wouldn't have made all the major bullies come from a single house--come on, a bully in Griffindor could have been much more interesting. This isn't really a single thing to change, though. It's actually kind of a lot of things to change. >.< Sorry, sorry.

If that doesn't count, then I would've changed the Wormtail fiasco in POA. Come on, a simple memory extraction from Harry, Ron, Hermione, or Lupin could have proved Sirius's innocence. The Ministry would have argued that Sirius could have modified their memories, but as we see in HBP, a modified memory is very easy to identify. And I firmly believe that Slughorn would be better at memory modification than Sirius. There's no reason that Sirius should have had to go on the run. I'm sure it was fun for him, but this always stood out to me as a plot hole when I read the series.

HP works on elemental tropes and large, sweeping generalizations and themes. So that sort of subtlety might not be possible, but the flaw is glaring in its obviousness. It turns the House system into something like an antagonist detector, not a working school system (and don't get me started on the psychological effects of that sort of built-in social divisiveness). I think it was in a Cracked.com video piece where someone questioned why, when you were sorted into Slytherin, you weren't just humanely put down. The books don't really suggest a counterpoint to that.

In JKR's defense, that is sort of taken care of. They just aren't /Harry's/ bullies. We know there were bullies in Griffindor in the past, namely the Marauders. There are also the Twins now, but they are clearly cast in a super-positive light, even though a literal reading of their antics is...questionable. We also know Ravenclaws have at least a few people harassing Luna. During the CoS and Gof, students in Hufflepuff were just as bad at shunning Harry as the rest of the school, so that might count. So no House is really immune, and it would be sort of silly to have an endless stream of bullies pushing Harry around.

But of course none of that is ever dealt with, because the books are about large issues and themes, not the nitty-gritty of daily life with magic or how a magical school actually works. Because that wasn't what the books were about. Enter: fanfiction.

**** That's true that not all the bullies come from Slytherin. Harry's point of view does skew that a bit (as a side note, I wouldn't consider what occurred in second year to Harry to be bullying. Avoiding another student because you /honestly fear for your life/ may be hurtful to that person, but is hardly an act of malicious bullying.) I guess the difference is that the bullies from Griffindor/Hufflepuff/Ravenclaw were portrayed more as good people who acted nastily, as opposed to the Slytherin bullies being nasty people who acted nastily. I know I'm just nitpicking on a series that I consider very good, but I just wish there was a Draco figure in another house, or a friendly figure from Slytherin.

Thank God for fanfiction.

*** There was lots of drama hinted at, but it was rarely important enough to affect the main plot. Kids were dating and fighting all the time, like everywhere, but if it wasn't relevant to Harry and co, we didn't really need to hear about it. That's the nature of books written from a fixed perspective. Side characters can be multidimensional, but the fact that the are side characters usually means you won't see the details that give them depth.

** Taure said this best in a recent DLP post, but I suppose that if I could change one thing, I would have left Voldemort dead and presented a different set of challenges to Harry and the others to face. Employing prophecy and "Chosen One" and the like is lazy storytelling and Voldemort was such a shallow literary character (a cut-out, mustache-twirling, underling-torturing bundle of villainous stereotypes) that the series would have benefited by just leaving him out. Lucius Malfoy and Dolores Umbridge made far more interesting antagonists and without a Voldemort in the mix, we could have avoided the last two books' quests for +plot coupons+ Horcruxes/Hallows, which was also rather lazy storytelling.

The first three books were classic mysteries, tightly written and clever. JKR strayed from that starting in book four, with the return of Voldemort, and the rest is history.

*** See, I liked the first three books, but I actually preferred the later ones. I agree that Voldemort was cartoon-ish (one of the reasons I love fanfiction: a lot of writers give Dark wizards more of a reasonable voice), but I disagree that he should have stayed dead. I would have loved to see more of a political war: the Order and Voldemort fighting to sway the Ministry. There was a little bit of this in books four through six, but it was always in the background. Harry was a teenager, so it's understandable that he wasn't /super/ interested and involved in politics. I would've loved to see more of a war, generally. This would've made the series even darker than it was, and inappropriate for children... so it definitely had no chance of occurring.

With more of a political battle and a war, we could get new antagonists: more prominent political rivals, like Umbridge or Lucius, and more battlefield opponents that weren't just handled by all the side characters as Harry saved the day. DH was a war novel, but because the trio were removed from the action, it didn't read as such. I wish we could've gotten more trio involvement in a war effort, or even another point of view (Neville? Percy? Lupin? Draco? Ginny?) to show what the war was like for those not privileged enough to escape.

*TL;DR Keep Voldemort alive, but have more of a mature and intricate political division and more focus on the wizarding war.*

Burn the heretic.

But seriously, I think you may actually like the /idea/ of the later books, not their execution.

Then it wasn't, it was a travel log. It is sad that the most interesting parts of that book occur off screen, so to speak. Hogwarts resistance, pure-blood politics being enacted, international reactions, Tonks and Lupin, people dealing with the most powerful wizard in the country dying.

None of that happens to our characters, so a lot is left unexplored. Another reason fanfic is so popular with this series of books.

***** I know you were kidding about my being a heretic, but seriously, my liking different books than you doesn't mean I've forced myself to ignore what you consider shoddy execution. I just have different tastes, and I prefer the more complex and less linear plots to a mystery-style book. Mystery isn't really my favorite genre. I initially read the books for the world-building and characters, not the plot. I think the first three books contain just as many plot holes as the later ones, but without the darker themes and wider cast of characters that I grew to adore. Maybe I'm unusual, but that doesn't mean my opinion is inherently wrong or that I just like the idea of the books.

I just classify it as a war novel because of what I know is occurring off-screen. I'm sure this is part of the reason that HP fanfiction is so popular (other reasons including that the HP books/characters themselves are extremely popular and that Rowling had a habit of not treating her characters kindly). Whatever the reasons are, I'm certainly grateful for them.

*** Actually, that's a cool idea-Voldemort really, truly dies at Godric's Hollow, but all the events in the books still happen. Why? Because his death ignited a struggle for control of the wizarding world, and having everyone believe that Voldemort had returned was key to someone's power play. Now /there/ is a mystery re-working for books five through seven, a more complex whodunnit than originally envisaged.

** I think if I could change one thing, and not have that one thing change the whole series, it would be the Tri Wizard tournament. That whole book had so many issues, and the tournament would have been more boring than golf to watch, since you can't see the people the whole time.

I didn't actually like the first three books for their plots, dragging mysteries on the whole year made the characters do nothing, and just wait for the next clue event to happen. These books were also the ones where the kids inexplicably had to do all the work.

** I would have changed how harry acted after Umbridge treated him in detention and the 'I must not tell lies' written in the back of his hand. It would have been so interesting if Harry went straight up to Dumbledore and dobbed in Umbridge and then if Dumbledore though Harry was lying for some reason ( which i doubt he wouldnt because Dumbly loves Harry) and for harry to take Vectimserum and THEN dumbly realises that he made a mistake and SHOUTS AT AND FIRES UMBRIDGE IFRONT IF THE WHOLE SCHOOL

PS THIS WHOLE THING SHOULD BE AT NEAR THE END OF THE BOOK THOUGH SO WE STILL GET TO SEE UMBRIDGE BEING A BITCH

** More POVs than Harry. It really restricts the story and minimizes the huge world created for it as everything we get is through the eyes of a socially awkward boy who doesn't know anything about the world he lives in. This is especially hammered home in Deathly Hallows...like...that /whole/ story took place off the page...it was so bizarre.

Should have been seven POVs, obviously.
