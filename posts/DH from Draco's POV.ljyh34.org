Good evening!

Does anyone have any recommendations for fics that show the timeline of Deathly Hallows from Draco's point of view? I want something gritty, that doesn't shy away from the realities of war (although I would prefer no rape/non-con) and doesn't apologise for what Malfoy and his family did and the role they played in everything.

If there's redemption at the end, that's a bonus, but not in a "hey presto, everything's great" or "love conquers all" kind of way. But equally, if the whole lot of them get thrown in Azkaban to rot that's alright too! I don't need a happy ending. Sometimes that's the last thing I want!

Context: Draco has never been a character I've been particularly drawn to in the series to be honest. But my flatmate loves him, and Tom Felton is pretty awesome, so I thought I'd branch out and I'm in the mood for something dark.

Thank you


** I would be interested in this as well.
