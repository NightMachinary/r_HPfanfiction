** Some time ago I went on a binge of these stories (and I've listed the ones I read below). Sadly, they all sort of mush together to the point I don't really remember what I liked and what was horrible. I mean some (like Erebus Ferrox Riddle) are obviously not going to be great but beyond that.... I do remember liking Family Matters (or at least the early chapters)? One that is updating still, and therefore still in my mind is Benefits of old laws; which you should check out if you want adopted stories. It has some pretty good characterization and Harry doesn't immediately turn "Dark", he in fact struggles with even liking LV who treats him so much better then anyone else has.

TMR/LV as his biological father:

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals on another way. Harry will find his world turned upsite down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

  Dark!Harry. Lily Potter fell victim to the charms of Tom Riddle Jr and had an affair, she ends up pregnant but the dates are close so she is unsure until a paternity test confirms her worst fears. News gets back to the Dark Lord and she hides but its fruitless, he hunts down the Potter's to take whats rightfully his but things don't go to plan thanks to the meddling headmaster. Banished from his body, Voldemort swears he will return to get his son and when he does, the world will be introduced to the Dark Prince.

  Harry Potter isn't really Harry Potter. Neither is he the Boy-Who-Lived, and is therefore thrown away as trash. When he turns sixteen, glamours unwraps his true self and he leaves the Light to find his real family. Slash, HP/DM.

  They all thought Lily was Light. She wasn't. She was in love with the Dark Lord, and gave birth to his son. Now Erus Riddle is growing up, showing just how evil the son of Lord Voldemort can be. Of course, the Light doesn't know that fact. Slash later.
