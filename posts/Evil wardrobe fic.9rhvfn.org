** You're looking for "Like a Redheaded Stepchild", a crackfic where Harry is a ginger and is adopted by the Weasleys. In the second year, the Muggleborn students all recognise Lockhart's schtick from horror movies, but the other kids ignore their complaints. Linkffn(12382425).

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.
