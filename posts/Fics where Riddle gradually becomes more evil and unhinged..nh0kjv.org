I'd love to read fics where he starts off as a (more or less) normal kid and slips further and further down the slope as years go by. Kinda looking for a Joker-esque Riddle, to be precise.

And please, no misunderstood, revolutionary Tom that ends up marrying Harry/Hermione.


** Darn, I've actually read something exactly like this but I can't remember the name, maybe if I describe it someone will know? I don't actually remember much. Tom would periodically visit this old women (I think someone who was kind to him when he was younger) and she watched as he first came to her as an angry boy and then started going down this darker path, covering up the anger with hate and disdain for others but she could always see him as the boy she knew underneath. The last scene was so tragic because he came to her house and she could tell he wasn't fully human: waxy skin, red eyes, and he couldn't drink her tea anymore (the reader knows it's from Horcruxes but she doesn't). I think there was the implication that he knew he'd gone too far but wouldn't turn back.
