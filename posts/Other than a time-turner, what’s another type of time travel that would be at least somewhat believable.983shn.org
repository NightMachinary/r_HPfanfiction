It doesn't have to have origins in or even be from the HP universe, but I'm trying to compile a list of different types and ways of time travel for a fic I'm planning.

It could be anything from another time device, a ritual of some sort, a special place, or interfering deities.


** linkffn(Nightmares of Futures Past) uses a magical field that theoretically can send things back in time, but requires nigh-infinite energy input to send even a single atom. So Harry kills himself and sends his soul back.

linkffn(Backward With Purpose) involves brewing a potion and adding all the memories you want to send back, stripping yourself of those memories in the process.

  The war is over. Too bad no one is left to celebrate. Harry makes a desperate plan to go back in time, even though it means returning Voldemort to life. Now an 11 year old Harry with 30 year old memories is starting Hogwarts. Can he get it right?

** While I don't have any sort of device to time-travel to offer I'd like to add that in my opinion, Time-Travel should be restricted by something that makes the whole process extremely dangerous. For example, I like when people that travel to a time where they already exist can soil their counterpart's soul if they aren't careful. An olderHarry that goes around mass murdering could possibly corrupt youngHarry as they're both the same person, and therefore there's a connection between their souls. Or maybe the more powerful youngHarry is the weaker olderHarry becomes, since the soul feeds off his stronger counterpart. Anything that makes the process threatening or else what would stop everyone from trying to travel back time and fix things. It could also destroy your soul in the process as a way to pay for meddling with time.

Just my two cents, as I enjoy Time-Travel with consequences because I always thought the ability to go back in time to be the most powerful in fiction.

Linkffn(Blindness) has a cool theory about the veil being essentially a 4th hallow. If a sufficiently smart character figured out something similar and walked through with all the hallows that'd be a cool mechanism.

** You could use---either for Merlin himself, or as a thing a contemporary wizard is researching---the idea from the Arthur mythos that Merlin lives through time totally differently than normal people do. (Here's [[https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/15146/how-does-t-h-whites-merlyn-experience-time][a thread about it]] .)

This is from that thread---it's from /The Sword in the Stone/:

“Now ordinary people are born forwards in Time, if you understand what I mean, and nearly everything in the world goes forward too. This makes it quite easy for the ordinary people to live, just as it would be easy to join those five dots into a W if you were allowed to look at them forwards, instead of backwards and inside out. But I unfortunately was born at the wrong end of time, and I have to live backwards from in front, while surrounded by a lot of people living forwards from behind. Some people call it having a second sight.”

** The Breaking of a time device is pretty common for uncontrolled time travel. Good example is "Like Grains of Sand in the Hourglass".

Another common one is sending memories back. An example is "A little child shall lead them"

Another is to have the time travel really be parallel dimension travel. This also gives you a chance to change things. 'course if you do this your alternate dimension should be identical to cannon except Snape sports a Mohawk.

Another common one is to do purely a 'communication' between times (the memory one is kind of a derivative of this). I think a lot of 'hp reads the books' does this

Another common one is reincarnation. Either because the main character caused it to happen, or because it always happens and for some reason your character gets to keep his memory.

There is also the groundhog day scenario. See "The many deaths of Harry Potter"

** Orson Scott Card has some interesting time travel mechanics in Pathfinder saga. (The story is way too bizarre though).

He actually introduces several mechanisms. The main char is a pathfinder who can see the Paths of people and in conjunction with other character they can travel by touching the path.

There's also time slicing( i think that's what is called) which is either exisiting for just a milisecond per second (hence you seem to be travelling forward) or the opposite. When travelling forward the person is there but disappears way too soon so they become somewhat invisible but they are slow and can be hurt.

He laso fucks with everything related to paradoxes so it gets challenging to follow the plotlines.

Edit: sorry for not being an idea from a fic, but they were just mentioning the usual (portals and time sand). Also ive seen tine travel by sacrifice ritual (Harry sacrifices himself in a ritual but sends his soul and memories to younger version of himself).

** - /Temporal Beacon/ features a runic anchor which allows future you to target information back to that point, if I remember correctly.
- I quite liked the Groundhog-Day-esque nature of /Wastelands of Time/. That was granted by an intensely magical being.
- Someone else mentioned precognition already.
- I think the location the Time Sand is from could provide interesting, uncontrollable time-based effects. I imagine it to be some sort of desolate wasteland caused by some mysterious event in the past or the future, kept hidden from everyone by the Department of Mysteries or similar.
- The Room of Requirement, if abused enough, could probably lead you to leave it at a different point in time that the Room existed. Perhaps such abuse destroys the Room, leaving it as a one-way trip.
- Maybe if you can get the Anglia up to 88mph, something weird happens. I really want to know if this has been done, now!
- I really like the idea of ancient magical forests having weird effects on people who stay in them too long. Maybe Harry follows something into the depths of the Forbidden Forest and exits at a different time than expected.

I'll see if I can think of more and get back to you. I feel like I'm not being very original, but I hope it helped at least somewhat.
