I've tried googling but I'm spelling something wrong so I keep getting no results back.

It starts in fourth year, she has an incredibly French like name, Margurite eleanore or something along those lines, and she ends up pregnant sometime around 5th/6th year. I'm sorry I can't be more specific, those are really the points which stood out to me in my memory. It's a complete story and by the epilogue I know she has had a bunch of kids. And I BELIEVE it might be on ff.net, but I'm not quite sure about that.


** This got me interested in seeing if there were other fem Harry and Snape fic so I started searching for other such stories, and I think I found the story you are looking for. Apologies if I am wrong about this being the story you're looking for but if it isn't the story you wanted, it sounds very similar. linkffn(4831537)

  To keep Sirius from dying, Harry will do anything, even if she doesn't know she's doing it. NON-OoC Girl!Harry/SS, cannon thru GoF, with a dash of sarcasm, spring cleaning, and mature themes.
