Something like Second Year: There's a Rune on the Sink that only Parselmouths can remember where the Chamber Entrance is, so it explains why Dumbledore didn't stop the Basilisk. The Blood wards actively suppress the Horcrux if he's there a set amount of time, Voldemort had done something to the wards or had some obscuring thing so the Wards didn't detect him/the diary/any of it. Stonewalled by Politics to stop him helping Sirius, things that make Dumbledore keep his competence, whilst keeping things the same.


** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) has exactly this. The mirror was a trap to capture Voldemort, Riddle did something to hide the connection between his later visage, and Remus...you'll have to read.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Well. There's a lot of idiot ball rolling around in canon, but "ward" is a fanon word, you know. There are lots of fanfics that depict the castle as having these "wards" that detect dark magic or objects, but in canon, they simply didn't exist, so that's why they didn't detect anything. And I don't believe that Dumbledore ever knew where the Chamber was located in the first place, and he didn't know the monster WAS a basilisk, so that explains why he never stopped it.

*** You would have assumed in 50 years Dumbledore would have done exactly what Harry and Ron did, and ask the victim, who happens to still be a ghost. Ward might be a Fanon word, but if Hermione can set basically the equivalent of Bounded Fields from Nasuverse around the Tent during the Horcrux Hunt, you would assume Hogwarts has something.

**** Myrtle hasn't been at Hogwarts all 50 years. She returned as a ghost so she could haunt Olive Hornby in revenge for her bullying. Olive finally went to the Ministry of Magic to restrain Myrtle, after Myrtle ruined her brother's wedding, and only after that was she at Hogwarts. But we have no idea how long afterwards that was, or what Myrtle feels about the staff, whether she would talk to them.

It may not be so easy to define "dark" magic or there may be politics involved in such a thing, so the board of governors might not allow it to be detected. I know it's certainly something we talk about a lot here, what constitutes dark magic.

***** That one I didn't know. But still, given all that time, and Dumbledore knows it was Myrtle who was killed and that Tom did it, asking what she saw, when and where, even if it's when it all started up again... It's the "Idiot Adults so the children can be the heroes" plot, i guess.

****** Yeah, must be. The only other solution I could think is that Myrtle has gotten so upset when asked in the past that Dumbledore doesn't think it will be possible to ask her again, sort of like Slughorn.
