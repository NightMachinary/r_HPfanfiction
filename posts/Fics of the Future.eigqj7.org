So, we've had a few great posts about our favourite fics to end out the year, all the fantastic stuff we've seen written and loved from all these magnificently creative folks around the fandom. How about one for all the fics we'd want to see?

Prompts, people. Prompts galore! Three word prompts, song prompts, long-rambly-page-long-paragraph prompts, lemon and lime and artichoke, crossover, au, dark, light, or utterly cliched messes, whatever. Lets New Years Resolution this thing and list the fics we hope the new year will bring.


** My first contribution is a mildly cliche'ed one based on a book called Horrors of the Dancing Gods by Jack Chalker - James Potter survived the night Voldemort came for them, but he was taken by faeries and turned into a nymph. He's rather alright with being female, but he's very distressed by the rules that come with being a faery. Particularly that you can't cross wards without permission - and Blood wards not at all, blood going cold upon leaving the body, and the iron content and all. So, since he can't see his son, he travels until he finds an ancient evil arising. When that ancient evil mentions his son, he returns home to help him fight.

The evil could be Voldemort, could be something else looking to compete with or even help Voldemort, James could get faery abilities or allies, etc etc.

** Does anyone know /Before I Go To Sleep/? It would be similar but with Lily and Snape as the main characters. I am actually a Snape fan and don't think he was obsessive or creepy, but I'd love a story where Lily has this specific type of amnesia (if you don't know that specific book, it's the same type of amnesia as in 50 first dates - every time you go to sleep you forget everything that happened and wake up thinking it is a day before the accident) and wakes up with Snape as her husband everyday. She can't remember anything that has happened since she left school. But through writing a diary that she keeps from Snape she slowly figures out what really happened, that Voldemort spared her and Snape continually has to erase her memory while she sleeps, making her forget about Harry. As I said that's not how I see Snape but it would be a perfectly creepy thriller. It's on my fic idea list, but first I have to finish my wip and then I'd write a few oneshots first, so I'm not sure if I'll ever get around to writing it. So feel free to use this idea, but do send me the link if you do because I'd love to read something like that.

** Something about the magical world in the year 2020. Muggle technology has grown like crazy over the last decades, magical society has developed more slowly but it has changed as well. Electronics still don't work around Hogwarts and other strongly magical locations, but people have enchanted programmable mirrors that can run code that emulates a normal phone's CPU. There's a wizard only section of the internet containing digitized copies of everything in the Hogwarts library, because Ravenclaws had enough of spending all their time in the library without a search engine. The obliviator department has hybrids of magical paintings and muggle AI technology that keep an eye on all social media for sightings of magic. Steve Jobs is still around, the wizards cured his cancer in exchange for backdoors into all IPhones. The department of mysteries is working on a P=NP encryption breaker that works by sending data back in time, and someone got fired after using it for Bitcoin mining. An ex-SpaceX engineer with a muggleborn son built a magic rocket engine with infinite fuel in his backyard and now there's goblins in the belt trying to figure out how to mine gold in zero g. There's an international project to develop spells that could vanish carbon in the atmosphere at the absolutely mind-boggling scale necessary to significantly slow down climate change. Pureblood supremacists are still around and spread conspiracy theories on WizBook that the internet was really invented by wizards first, because muggles couldn't possibly create something that great, and everyone else just unfriends them. And some people are a bit worried about the new invisible and silent enchanted drones that the department of magical law enforcement is operating.

***** Welp. I'm totally stealing that "pureblood supremacists spreading conspiracy theories" thing and maybe the "wizard only section of the internet" thing too. I've been trying to figure out a way to steal magic from others via some muggle method. That's the only idea I have kicking around that I cannot work out.

****** As for stealing magic, I could totally picture some rich guy buying an entire muggle gene tech startup, tell all the scientists about magic secrecy be damned, and dump millions into finding the magic gene...

If they find something, it could be possible to sell rich muggles a procedure to give them test tube designer babies with magical abilities. How many billions do you think someone like Bezos would pay to have a son with the ability to warp the fabric of the universe?

And the magical world would be quite surprised to get a bunch of ultra rich muggleborns eleven years and nine months later.

** A Muggleborn Dark Lord, with his followers, start terrorizing the Magical world, wanting to bring about a new world where Muggleborns reign.

Oh, and they don't like the Muggleborn Minister of Magic Hermione Granger and her toadies Ron Weasley and Harry Potter as well. They think Ron is a pureblood enemy, Hermione is a blood traitor, and Harry didn't do anything to help them during Wizarding War 2.

Bonus if totally new main characters/or those mentioned once or twice in canon. Say Euan Abercrombie or Maisie Cattermole.

** I like fan fiction stories where some little detail is changed and the story explores the ramifications of the change. Especially I like stories where the change is some character acting rationally. In canon, many people do absolutely stupid decisions just for the plot to go in some direction.

Currently I am writing a story where Tom Riddle's diary decides to take advantage of Harry's ignorance about him, and to usurp Voldemort as the Dark Lord. However, I have some other ideas as well, but I am unsure if I will ever have the motivation to write stories about them:

1. After Sirius escapes Azkaban, he actually forms a plan of what to do. Why did he not contact Lupin or Dumbledore to explain the truth?

2. Fudge believes Harry and Dumbledore about Voldemort's return and makes a plan of what to do. He could publicly accuse Harry of lying, but then trick Malfoy and the other influential Death Eaters into a trap or something.

3. Dumbledore abandons his idealism after Voldemort's return and uses any methods necessary to end the threat as efficiently as possible. ("For the Greater Good!") He beats Fudge into submission and takes all political power. He takes all Death Eaters' children as hostages. He orders the execution of every Death Eater in Azkaban. He tells about Horcruxes to a group of trustworthy Aurors and sends them to find the Horcruxes. Voldemort would be screwed. (It is frustrating that so many people died and suffered because Dumbledore the Goodie lacked the resolve required for a military leader.)

As in Harry is a magical prodigy, genius and charismatic. How do the events in canon enfold then?

First chapter is worth a read and can be taken as a one shot. The rest is a bit cringey Harry x Hermione romance that I couldn't get pass.

** I've seen a few fics where Harry goes to another school, but I've never seen one where the entire story is set in another country. The people are all the same, Hogwarts is still where Harry goes but it is in the Canadian Rockies, or US Alaska or the Australian Outback. Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, if he is from the US, he joins every school sports team he can so he doesn't have to spend time at home. Maybe, Hagrid is from the deep south or McGonagall is a native America or French Canadian, Dumbledore likes bowls instead of bowling.

** Had another thought - Wrong Boy Who Lived, but flip the Dursley-Potter situation. Somehow, not sure how exactly, Voldemort ends up taking out the Dursleys instead of the Potters and Dudley ends up being the Boy Who Lived. Somehow, through having Voldemort's soul, Dudley gets magic and goes to Hogwarts with Harry and gets taken in by the Potters. Maybe there's some variation in the protection since they're Muggles and Dudley gets intermittently taken over by Voldemort or some such.

Could be at one year old like canon, but could also be later on to bring in some of the 'Magicals are all freaks' cliche Dursley-ness for Dudley to spout while at Hogwarts.

** I'd love to see something like The Stand, but the virus only affects muggles and the survivors gain magic. The story could be set after the virus has spread and wizards/witches have to figure out what to do with all the empty space, new magical people, and rise of subhuman magical nations.

Another would be Grindlewald and/or Herpo the Foul to become important players in the story.

Also would be cool to see a Hogwarts club emulate the Scouting system with meetings, excursions, and merit badges tailored to magical survival skills. Like maybe there's a magic aspect to fire-making with magic trees used for wands that went out of style, but was one of the first expressions of magic back in the Neolithic.

** Harry goes on to live a mundane life as a quidditch player, but sees death eaters in every shadow. After crying wolf too many times, he becomes a shut-in. Eventually, it becomes clear that he was not crying wolf, at least some of the time. But it wasn't death eaters. It was a new group of people. Possibly muggleborns who are trying to start a revolution and want him on their side.

So he sits in his home and reads the paper and checks in on people etc while the story goes on around him. But he does nothing, because he doesn't care what happens.

Meanwhile, lots of people die on all sides, and everyone assumes Harry is in reserve for the other side.
