Let me preface this by saying that I don't really consider Golden Bullets to be Hermione bashing, and I actually liked the angle the story was exploring. I only mention that fic specifically because it's what started my train of thought.

I was reading linkao3(Golden Bullets by CescaLR) a while ago and then forgot about it. Today while I was in the shower it came back to mind for some reason, and I realized that Hermione bashing is something I don't come across often.

The very very few fics I can think of that portray her negatively are usually ones where Harry is sorted into Slytherin and/or explores dark magic/befriends Draco or other kids of death eaters, etc, etc. I cant recall any of those fics by name, and they weren't exactly Hermione bashing because they hardly focused on her at all.

Am I just missing those fics or is it one of the lesser written character bashings? How do people feel about Hermione, especially when it comes to writing her in any sort of negative light? I'm pretty neutral, I don't love or hate any of the main characters, but I love hearing what others think on these topics!


** These are the common forms of Hermione-bashing:

- Can't let go of authority-figures (bashed!Dumbledore) or is outright in league with them.
- Bossy know-it-all who happens to be /wrong/ more often than not (her books are wrong and she can't admit that).

See also: "Grey/Dark!Harry", "Independent!Harry".

It's less common than Ron-bashing because of two factors:

- She's an author insert, so she's usually shown in a positive light (her flaws are made to seem forgivable more often than not).
- Movie!Hermione is barely flawed at all, and the movies are a more common first-point-of-contact for the franchise than the books.

People keep bringing this up, and, indeed, WoG is that Hermione is based on how JKR remembers herself at that age (but smarter). However, the other part of that interview was that she doesn't remember herself very fondly at all.

**** Rowling may have called out Hermione's flaws in an interview, but she did not do so in the books. Even when Hermione sent birds at Ron's face, the narrative treated her as the victim, with emphasis being on her running away crying rather than Ron literally bleeding.

***** It's what was the most salient thing for Harry at the time. I don't think Harry is very good at objectively assessing relative balance of harm.

Anyway, I am not sure what you are looking for here. It's not like any of the characters sit down with a therapist to calmly discuss their flaws. And, canon is not exactly short on giving Hermione consequences for her behaviour: off the top of my head, for her hectoring of Ron, Hermione is humiliated and almost killed by a troll; for the Firebolt, she is ostracised by her only friends for a good part of a year. She endures being a laughingstock and loses valuable time for her SPEW efforts.

****** While it's true that she sees consequences to her actions, when I really think about it (in the instances you mention) she ultimately ends up being told she's right, rewarded, or otherwise benefitting from her actions, even if she suffers momentarily. After the troll, she gains two best friends. After the firebolt incident, if I'm remembering correctly (which I may not be, so forgive me if I'm wrong here), it's admitted that she wasn't wrong in being cautious. As for the SPEW thing, even that gets justified in a way with Dobby becoming the trio's savior and in a very quiet way serves to highlight how the wizarding world at large is bigoted and that the injustice is ingrained so deeply that nobody even notices it at all.

******* You are moving the goalposts here. To paraphrase Keynes, /ultimately/, we are all dead. Most actions have mixed consequences.

One could argue that in even longer term, Hermione's "best friends" are people with whom she had next to nothing in common and who get far more from their friendship with Hermione (schoolwork help, general knowledge, level head, spell arsenal, planning) than Hermione from them (emotional support, sometimes?), and it's a friendship that is very conditional (as we see in Year 3) and repeatedly puts her life in danger.

Even if we suppose that someone admitted that Hermione had been correct about the Firebolt---and I don't remember such a thing either---as a consequence of the stress she suffered from losing that friendship, Hermione loses the time-turner.

Since SPEW within Hogwarts didn't go anywhere, the wasted time and the humiliation that Hermione suffered was completely in vain. Her SPEW efforts are in no way connected to Dobby saving the Trio, since Dobby was loyal to Harry since more than a year prior.

If you are concerned about Hermione being proven right in principle, would you rather for Hermione to not have fought for House-Elf rights, or would you rather for canon to have found ways to justify their slavery and mistreatment to show Hermione wrong?

The bottom line is, I am hearing vague complaints with limited factual basis, and I am still not sure exactly what you would have wanted to see.

********* Correct me if I'm wrong (pretty possibly that I am projecting), but do you mean in the sense of breaking apart from the so common fandom pattern in which Hermione is regarded as some kind of patron saint of reason and knowledge that has omniscience and is always treated as being right and so the unruly children around here should do as she says?

If so then I can recommend linkffn(Prediction, no thank you! by sonotalady), it actually treats the situation in a realistic form without bashing or otherwise making her some kind of monster, linkffn(rise of the wizards) does go into Hermione bashing, but it is really well done and more along the line of extreme arrogance instead of being the same old adage of her just being an awful human being, and linkao3(Say a Prayer by mad_fairy) has in the first parts of the series her being pushed away from the group for her behavior and personality, though it is limited to her just being unlikeable instead of actual bashing. Otherwise most fanfics that are Indy!Harry bash her somehow.

I've never liked Hermione, but as a kid I found her tolerable until DH. As an adult I don't like her at all. She's one of the favs of the series, but I've come across a few who've re-read them as adults and they at least see more of her flaws.

** There's a Harry-is-sent-back-to-his-younger-body fic where he decides to not befriend Ron and Hermione because in the alt-future, they go along with the decision to execute him since they're convinced that he's a Horcrux and that as long as he's alive, Voldemort will come back. So he comes back (along with Voldemort since their souls are linked) and becomes a Slytherin. And the fic kind of leans into the huge difference that makes in Hermione and Ron's lives. It's a negative enough portrayal I feel it's bashing:

#+begin_quote
  ​ “Excuse me,” a most unwelcome voice sounded behind them.

  “Miss tattletale,” Harry said with his most pleasant smile. “I assure you this has nothing to do with you. So naturally you will now go and report it to McGonagall anyway, am I right?”

  Hermione frowned at him. “I was perfectly within my rights to -- “

  “Yeah, I have no desire to spend any time near you, Miss tattletale. Neville, just stay in bed tonight and you'll be fine. See you tomorrow.” And with that Harry turned around and walked toward the dungeons, Blaise and Theo hurrying to catch up.

  “What did Granger do?” Theo asked as they climbed down the stone stairs.

  “Told McGonagall our official study group refused her. I clarified the situation and then McGonagall still insisted I make friends with her. I firmly refused.”

  “I wonder if Granger even realizes her behaviour is making her own Head of House treat her like a charity case,” Blaise said with a proper amount of pureblood scorn at the idea of accepting charity.

** Bashing of Hermione in fanfic tends to be a bit be more about subtle degradation than about the comic exaggeration and physical harm that is more common for Ron. A lot of it is not even intended: I think that usually, it's because the author has read vastly more fanfic than they have canon and has a certain degraded view of Hermione. Something similar goes for the GreaterGood!Dumbledore.

Take, for example, this passage from linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6049450/1/]]). This is a post-Voldemort fic in which the Wizengamot passes a Marriage Law and Harry fights back. The following shows the Trio, Ginny, and miscellaneous Gryffindors reacting to the news:

#+begin_quote
  So softly that Hermione and Ron had to strain to hear it, Harry said, "I didn't fight him for this. I fought and defeated him so my friends could enjoy life, but I not do it for something like this."

  "Harry," Hermione called sadly, "even though we all know it's a power-grab, it's the law now. We don't have a choice."

  He continued to hold his girlfriend tightly and rock her gently. "An unjust law is no law at all."

  "Harry..."

  "Hermione, not now. I need to think." He closed his eyes to concentrate better, and to hide what he really felt.
#+end_quote

Did you see what the author did there? From being someone who never hesitated to break laws in the interests of justice, and from someone who does pretty much all the planning for the trio, Hermione has been degraded into the authority-worshipper portrayal. In the rest of the fanfic, she is treated well enough, and even plays an important role in executing Harry's plan. The author clearly does not dislike Hermione. And yet, they wrote what they wrote.

Hermione is also subject to a [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect][Worf Effect]] of sorts. Basically, suppose that a writer wants to show you how good their Smart!Harry (or Smart!Fem!Harry, or Draco, or Daphne) is at magic, or generally how smart, competent, creative, or knowledgeable they are. Having them publically upstage Hermione with ease or correct her on some bit of knowledge is a convenient way to do that---but that inevitably comes at Hermione's expense. In particular, since the author generally doesn't want to portray their protagonist as a bully, it is left to Hermione to initiate the confrontation that culminates in the demonstration of the protagonist's superiority, compounding the bashing.

By Voldemort's count, Harry got saved by two flukes that have nothing to do with Horcruxes, and he's been spelunking Harry's brain and finding nothing about Horcruxes. Why would he ever check? As far as he's aware, the prophecy has been played out. He marked Harry, and Harry has a power that would allow him to defeat Voldemort, that Voldemort didn't know about. That's the only part he heard about.

If Harry were part of a concentrated effort by the Ministry, that would be a different story. The public sees Harry as a savior. Harry would be even more of a political problem than he is, and he'd have the resources to back it up. Instead of being a relatively powerless idiot who lucked out three times, he'd be a threat who's already interacted with one of Voldemort's Horcruxes, and in the presence of Aurors and Unspeakables who could recognize what it was. Voldemort had no reason to believe that Dumbledore knew about Horcruxes, and - from his perspective - Snape surely would have informed him if he did. Harry with Dumbledore is not a threat to his Horcruxes. Harry with the Ministry at his beck and call is.

***** Just to be safe, this is my subjective opinion. I won't take it personally if you disagree :).

So, Hermione actually gets the least amount of real character development in the trio /in my opinion/. Rowling uses her as a way to forward the plot.

So book 1 Hermione is initially shown to be the most annoying kind of 11 year old. Once the troll rescue happens, she literally relaxes and shows social improvement.

My issue with this is that Rowling tries to use Hermione breaking the rules for a good cause as ooc in the series for development.

Rowling also dropped SPEW as a plot point, which is really odd, because Hermione had a point, though her activism was ineffective.

Hermione is also jealous of Fleur. This could be used to develop her character as it's mostly unfounded, but again, it's dropped.

I like having Hermione, an intelligent, borderline genius, loyal girl make mistakes, be socially awkward. Rowling nixed the social awkwardness after book 3 and handwaves away the mistakes.

****** I'd say you've just provided some examples of Hermione's development: when you say that this or other character trait was never followed up, that's because Hermione grew out of it.

When Ron called her a "nightmare", Hermione realised that the things she thought she was doing to befriend people (keeping them out of trouble by telling them when they are breaking rules, providing unsolicited advice in class) was actually antagonising. She learned from that, and toned it down a bit (a bit).

Hermione tried the SPEW approach to house-elf welfare, and it didn't work very well. She tried the "underground" approach of knitting tiny clothes. It didn't work either. So, she went into government instead, which did.

More generally, I think that she is far more empathetic and somewhat less judgemental by the time she gets to DH.

I don't remember how Hermione related to Fleur, so I can't speak to that.

Also, I wouldn't call early-canon Hermione socially awkward. In fact, she was very outspoken and gregarious. She was bad at winning friends and influencing people, but she never displayed a lack of confidence that I would associate with awkwardness.

I just feel most of her development was in the earlier books and the development of her character stagnated a bit.

So yes, I feel her character definitely grew up by deathly hallows. I just feel too much of it is offscreen.

Like the example with the house elves. We only get told by supplementary materials she works in government to free the elves. I would have loved some sort of precursor to that in the books.

I don't know about her development stagnating in the later books; frankly, I kind of wish that her "developments" in HBP never developed. What sorts of developments would you have liked to see for her?

House-elves? In Chapter 10 of DH, Hermione gives a whole speech to Harry about house-elves and Kreacher:

#+begin_quote
  ‘I don't understand you, Kreacher,' [Harry] said finally. ‘Voldemort tried to kill you, Regulus died to bring Voldemort down, but you were still happy to betray Sirius to Voldemort? You were happy to go to Narcissa and Bellatrix, and pass information to Voldemort through them ...'

  ‘Harry, Kreacher doesn't think like that,' said Hermione, wiping her eyes on the back of her hand. ‘He's a slave; house-elves are used to bad, even brutal treatment; what Voldemort did to Kreacher wasn't that far out of the common way. What do wizard wars mean to an elf like Kreacher? He's loyal to people who are kind to him, and Mrs Black must have been, and Regulus certainly was, so he served them willingly and parroted their beliefs. I know what you're going to say,' she went on, as Harry began to protest, ‘that Regulus changed his mind ... but he doesn't seem to have explained that to Kreacher, does he? And I think I know why. Kreacher and Regulus's family were all safer if they kept to the old pure-blood line. Regulus was trying to protect them all.'

  ‘Sirius --'

  ‘Sirius was horrible to Kreacher, Harry, and it's no good looking like that, you know it's true. Kreacher had been alone for a long time when Sirius came to live here, and he was probably starving for a bit of affection. I'm sure “Miss Cissy” and “Miss Bella” were perfectly lovely to Kreacher when he turned up, so he did them a favour and told them everything they wanted to know. I've said all along that wizards would pay for how they treat house-elves. Well, Voldemort did ... and so did Sirius.'
#+end_quote

After that, Harry is finally able to get through to Kreacher and win his loyalty.

We don't see much criticism of Hermione's acts because the book tells Harry perspective and he agrees with her. In any case, Hermione not having consequences relates more to a) a lack of staff supervision and b) nobody reporting her. It could well be that Hermione does feel guilty.

Also, I don't see why the firebolt thing is a sign she needs a consequence? She's 14 at this age, in a situation where she believes that unless action is taken immediately then her friend might die.

Personally, I think bashing fics have lazy writing. By all means, write nuanced characters with strengths and flaws, but if you need to drag a teenager down (fictitious or not)...

*** Let me start of by saying I like Hermione, but she definitely has some rough edges that need sanding down. I think she is largely friendless because some of her behaviors that she could stand to tone down. She especially when younger needs to learn about being right vs being happy.

I sadly don't know of many fics where people try to help her rather than just trying to break her down and discard her. Two examples are toning teacher petness and learning to help in a humble well received manner. Given how she stood with Harry during the tri-wizard tournament it's hard for me to stomach discarding her.

That all said, it's hard to call for any real punishments for her when the wizarding world is fundamentally unjust. None of the adults have spent time in jail when a vast number of them should've for actions taken before the start of first year. The death eaters are mostly free and the Hogwarts staff never go to jail for child endangerment due to the Philosopher stone trap. For school level stuff there's Draco, who literally gets away with attempted murder. Justice selectively applied is injustice.

** The most common Hermione bashing is found in pureblood fanboy and Death Eater apologist stories. There she's usually portrayed as the "ignorant mudblood" who needs to be taught that "Slavery is fine because elves need to be slaves" and that "she can't really learn the real magic/pureblood culture, only purebloods born into it (and Harry when taught by a pureblood princess) can do that". It's usually stuffed full of fanon stuff to bash the Weasleys as well. It often goes hand in hand with "She's not really smart, just hard-working" bashing, usually by people who are still traumatised by that kid in their class who was smarter than them. That usually crops up in "Harry is the real genius, he was just too lazy to apply himself properly because of Ron" stories.

** As much as I like a good "Hermione-bashing fics" thread, this is getting old. I mean, this is the third thread in the last couple of weeks asking for this, and that's just the ones I've seen. All I have are the same old recs because fics that focus on bashing her exclusively are so goddamn rare.

Anyway, here's the recs.

(Disclaimer: Some are Ron-centric and some might not be favourable to Harry either.)

I enjoyed Chilord's Sekrit Projekt fic: [[http://reader.7thpylon.com/chilord/sekrit-projekt.html]]. Harry and Ron are the stars of the fic and Hermione isn't so much outright bashed, but it definitely calls out her unpleasant behaviour. There's a Tracey/Ron shiptease that I liked. Unfortunately, it'll never be completed.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5858832/1/]]) one-sided job interview. A bit unrealistic but then again so are most bash fics. 🤷

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6452481/1/Gryffindors-Never-Die]]) has 58-year-old Harry and Ron go back to their 4th year. Hilarity ensues. Does contain some Ginny-bashing.

This community on FFN has some good fics as well: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/No-Hermione-Allowed/124957/]]

This fic has a Hermione with a Dumbledore-is-always-right attitude that forces Harry and even Ron to keep her out of the loop for quite a long time. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4776013/1/Blood-of-the-Phoenix]])

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11378607/1/]]) Has McGonagall talk to Hermione about her long essays and tells her to cut them down. Hermione ignores her.

linkffn([[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6257522/1/]]) Hermione isn't outright bashed nor is it a big part of the story. It's more about how she would fail to cope in the real world.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18935341/chapters/44954569]]) Hermione faces consequences for the bird attack. Borders on bashing at times. Alternating POVs.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12942112/1/]]). PeggySue!Ron POV. Not favourable to Hermione (or Harry at times).

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10434054/1/Not-the-Smartest-Witch]]) Hermione is not as smart as she portrays herself to be. One-shot.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13318530/1/Broken]]), linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19323346]]) SELF-PROMO! where Ron choses not to date Hermione. It's Hermione-critical, but Ron is also self-deprecating.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13204936/1/Hermione-Granger-and-The-Obliviated-Parents]]) Hermione un-Obliviates her parents. They only pretend to take it well.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13452914/1/Loose-Cannon]]) It doesn't focus on bashing, but it portrays Hermione as not perfect and definitely outlines her flaws.

However justified you may feel in snapping at people for opening discussions on a discussion forum, I'm afraid we'll just have to agree to disagree. I generally search a topic before I post on it to see if my questions or thoughts have been expressed before and how recently. In a search for Hermione bashing, the results returned that I saw were for the most part either very old, or were discussions/requests for general bashing, not Hermione specifically.

So be ticked off at me all you like for not being on this forum daily to take note of every single thing that's posted, I'm quite certain both you and I will survive. I do make an effort to avoid posting things that have clearly been hot topics in the last few months. The people who don't do that are likely not on the forum constantly; maybe they don't know they can search within a subreddit, or any other plethora of reasons for not having taken note of all discussions on here.

Even with all of that being said, there's such a thing as just not coming onto a topic that annoys you for the sole purpose of talking down to people for posting. Especially when you aren't even going to read said post before acting like you've been inconvenienced.

As people seem to be engaging in some really interesting discussion on this thread, I think I'll take my leave of this "argument" so I can pay more attention to those posts. 🤷‍♀️

  Usually it is someone highly intelligent that travels back in time -- even Harry is only suppressing his brilliance. But Ron? Hard-working, quick, open-minded... He is not. But with years of advantage over his peers even he can become something more than a tired Auror with a wife that hates him. Amoral!Sly!Ron.

** Rise of the Wizards is a fic where Harry eventually gets into conflict with Hermione. She is, at most a side antagonist, but an antagonist nonetheless. Also notable is that Harry doesn't realize this at first and their relationship degrades over time instead of instantly. Definitely worth a read.
