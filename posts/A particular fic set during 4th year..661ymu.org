It starts with Harry dating Hanna but they break up amicably after Harry's name comes out of the goblet because it's causing problems for Hanna with her House. Harry then moves on to his true pairing which I think was Ginny or Daphne. I don't remember much else about it.


** I'm pretty sure that what you're looking for is A Different Beginning by Breanie. It's not a particular fic set in 4th year, but a retelling of the whole series as if James survived the attack on the Potters in 1981. It's mostly a canon re-hash, except it starts to diverge a bit somewhere in the middle of the story. It's ultimately H/G.
