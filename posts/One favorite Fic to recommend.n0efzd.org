If you had to recommend one special fic to someone, which one would it be? I personally really enjoyed the writing and story telling of Honor thy Blood by TheBlack'sResurgeance.


** Nightmares of Futures Past by Viridian [[https://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=9305]]

  Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Heaps of dialogue and world-building, and OCs galore. Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. NO MORTAL PERIL.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

  Tucked under Regulus's arm was an old, hand bound book in a deep maroon. Embossed on the frayed leather were the words, 'The Purest Art of the Patronus: A guide to defending with Light'. Unlike the books in the Black Library, Sirius couldn't feel the oily oppressiveness of Dark Magic. If the title hadn't given it away, the Magic definitely would have.The book was pure Light Magic.

This was my introduction into the types of hp fics that delve beyond the UK, into other branches and societies as well as a tonne of beautifully written angst. It's just so good and the ending, gosh I freaked out as I got to the final chapters, totally unable to predict how it would end.

** So one of my all time favorites (and since I'm currently very into Dark!Harry) is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5402147/68/][Death of Today]] It's a slashfic which might not be your thing and Harry is called Izar in this which takes a bit to get used to. (Slowburn Harry/Voldemort) Apart from that, I still highly rec you to check it out. One of the best Death Eater!Harry fics I've read. It has a very interesting plot and plot-twists. Features manipulative!Voldemort, smart!Harry, a good character developement for Harry as well, cool world-building, especially in spell developement, alive Lily and James, Death Eater raids, clashes with competent Aurors.

Minor spoiler alert but an explanation for the premise: So basically Harry (Izar) is a product of an affair between Lily and Regulus Black - Lily seduced him in order to get intel for the Order of the Phoenix. She gives him up to an orphanage. Thus Lord Voldemort never got defeated the first time aroumd, but the Order is still fighting hard against him

I linked the complete fic on ffn above, but an edited version is currently being posted on ao3, chapter by chapter which is that one Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26953177]])

Unusually intelligent, he's recruited by both the Unspeakables and the Death Eaters at a young age. His loyalty, however, is not to the Ministry nor to the Death Eaters, but to the cause of bettering himself and becoming his own force in the Wizarding world. As he grows older, he constantly has to struggle to keep his footing around a manipulative and bored Dark Lord, who fancies mind games and intellectual entertainment.

** I've posted this elsewhere on the subreddit but my recent goto fic for a reread is linkao3(Sing a requiem) where Hermione realises that Harry is a horcrux in 6th year and horrified that he's so accepting of martyrdom, kidnaps him away from Hogwarts and Dumbledore with Ron's help.

Harry's journey from a groomed child martyr to finding self-love and discovering that life is worth living and fighting for, /that he's worth it/, his friends' horror and anger on his behalf is very very touching.

Especially in a fandom that fetishizes child soldiers and martyrdom and that what happened to Harry in canon was not only good but necessary, this story is a breath of fresh air.

  Harry is a Horcrux, isn't he? Hermione reads over what she has of her essay so far, ignoring the way her hands have started to shake. She circles some sentences here and there that she thinks might be stronger in a different part of the paper. Don't be silly. What a strange thought to have. Anyway.  Anyway.  During 6th year, Hermione has a realization that Harry is a Horcrux while doing some homework in the library. Things spiral out from there.
