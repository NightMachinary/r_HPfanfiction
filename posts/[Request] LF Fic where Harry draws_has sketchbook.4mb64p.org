Hey, all! I've read a few fics in the past where Harry draws, usually using a sketchbook. I was wondering if anyone knew of any they could recommend? Just read Candid, linkffn(1815794) and became newly interested in any fics where Harry sketches. Any pairing or no pairing, though I'd really appreciate any slash recs anyone has!

*** So I've seen summaries of this one before, and it's super long. Is it worth taking the time to read? I'm a bit of a grammar and language stickler and prefer things to be fairly well written. I've seen some very long ones that aren't well written. Also, does the plot carry through? Does it hold your attention through at least most of it?

**** Well, if your tolerance for typos is low, it'll be tested with this one. They're/their affect/effect accept/except happen.

BUT.

Imho it's one of the best fics in the fandom. I was totally hooked. It properly kicks into gear in second year, but this is a solid fanfic and it's aged well. If it draws you in, you won't notice how quickly you read it. If it doesn't, it may not be your cup of tea.

** Oh it's killing me. There was a good one where Harry learns to draw well and writes a book about caring for Basilisks (I think it's a baby one from CoS). I read it a long time ago, but perhaps this jogged someone's memory.

  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.

*** How good is this? I tried reading the Cupboard series by the author and found the writing mediocre and story full of cringeworthy tropes.

**** The writing's not bad! Nothing to write home about but I'd say it's decent. The story is a fresh idea that I had never seen done before so it's keeping me interested. It's neat to see how this Harry handles the tasks when he's extremely new at magic. His interactions with certain characters are pretty good. My only peeve with the story is the Harry/Daphne sort of relationship that's developing. I never really like her character in any story though so I think that's just me. It doesn't take away from the rest of the story's enjoyment.
