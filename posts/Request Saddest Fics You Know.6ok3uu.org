Well, Summer makes me sad and we haven't had this thread for a while. What are the saddest fics you know? Bonus points if you've never seen it recommended here, even more bonus points if it's Harry-centric.

Thank you.

Harry and 'Not-Harry' could grow up as twin brothers, never knowing the truth. A chance to see what Tom Riddle might've been like if he were raised by a loving family.

  "I'm sorry," he said again."Sorry's not enough, Sev. Be fucking better." Lily shut the door in his face. He spent the summer reading in the library, the park, and then sneaking home when he was hopeful his parents would be asleep. He tried to think about bravery, but sometimes he just thought about Lily's hair, the way it went more golden in summer. He tried to think about nobility, ethics and grace, but the clouds chased each other, fat and white, across the sky and he wasn't sure what any of this had to do with him.His father took him fishing by a dreary brown creek and they sat in silence. Severus could hear every creak, every lap of the water, every inhale and movement his father made. He thought maybe if he just said nothing, nothing ever, he'd never say anything again that made Lily's face go so flat and distant. If he said nothing, maybe nothing would hurt.His father reached for a beer can in a swift movement and Severus froze himself unflinching. He sat in that silence afterward, slowing his heartbeat, picking apart the sudden rigid shell of his shoulders. His father hummed, cracking the can open like a gunshot.(slight AU in which Sev is better at life)

  What if, when Petunia Dursley found a little boy on her front doorstep, she took him in? Not into the cupboard under the stairs, not into a twisted childhood of tarnished worth and neglect---what if she took him in?Petunia was jealous, selfish and vicious. We will not pretend she wasn't. She looked at that boy on her doorstep and thought about her Dudders, barely a month older than this boy. She looked at his eyes and her stomach turned over and over. (Severus Snape saved Harry's life for his eyes. Let's have Petunia save it despite them).Let's tell a story where Petunia Dursley found a baby boy on her doorstep and hated his eyes---she hated them. She took him in and fed him and changed him and got him his shots, and she hated his eyes up until the day she looked at the boy and saw her nephew, not her sister's shadow. When Harry was two and Vernon Dursley bought Dudley a toy car and Harry a fast food meal with a toy with parts he could choke on Petunia packed her things and got a divorce.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

** This fic immediately came to mind. Draco befriends Moaning Myrtle during his sixth year. It's short, and depressing. If you have half an hour to spare, give it a read.
