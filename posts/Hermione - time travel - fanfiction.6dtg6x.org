I don't speak in english very well, but I understand what I read. I hope you can help me and I'm sorry if you don't know what I want to say. I want read fanfiction: 1) Hermione is sister/daughter of marauder (James/Remus/Sirius). 2) Hermione back in time to marauder's era . 3) marauders - time forward - pairing Hermione/marauder. I hope you understand what I mean :) any help? :)


** One Step Forward, Two Decades Back: linkffn(11047955) Hermione time-travels back to the Marauder's Era and ends up being reborn (kind of) as Sirius' sister. The pairing is Hermione/Severus. While not usually my favourite pair, I found the story to be worth it and really enjoyable.

Sleeper: linkffn(11867729) No time travelling involved. Hermione is Sirius' daughter in this one, but they're not blood-related. She's still a Muggle-born, but she was adopted by Sirius and raised to infiltrate Slytherin as the perfect 'pureblood' spy.

Storm of Yesterday: linkffn(11494764) Hermione time travels. Marauders have graduated Hogwarts. It's a James/Hermione pairing.

The Light: linkffn(11129273) Hermione time travels. I won't tell the pairing in this one, because the development of romances between the characters are a pretty significant part of the story, and the pairing isn't blatantly obvious. I will say that Hermione does not end up with any of the Marauders, though that probably is a pretty big spoiler if you end up reading this fic.

Chemistry & Timing: linkffn(7860277) Hermione time travels not to the Marauder's era, but the beginning of her third year. Remus/Hermione pair. If you're looking for big, swooping changes to canon, this isn't the fic for you. The main focus, if I recall correctly, was on the romance between the two. I think everything else pretty much plays out as in canon. I rarely read fanfic that hugs to canon so closely, but I just loved Remus and Hermione's romance in this one.

A Little Child Shall Lead Them: linkffn(10871795) This one is short in comparison to the others I've linked you to. Hermione time travels back into baby Hermione's body and basically saves the world. Borders on cracky.

The Last Marauder: linkffn(8233539) I don't actually remember the plot of this fic, but it was in my favourites so I'll trust my past self's taste and assume it's decent. Pairing is Hermione/Remus, with Hermione time travelling back to the Marauder's era.

What the Water Gave Me: linkffn(8260570) Be warned, this one's a bit of a tear-jerker. Hermione time travels back. Hermione/James.

Many Thanks: linkffn(4692717) Again, don't really remember this fic. I've been scrolling through my favourites from basically most recently added to the oldest one added, which means the further down I go, the dustier my memory gets. I do remember liking this one, though. Anyway, this is a Hermione time travelling back to Marauder's era one. The summary says pairing is Harmony.

Aaaaaand, that's all I've got for you. Hope you enjoy!

  'Happiness can be found, even in the darkest of places, if one only remembers to turn on the light.' What the Marauders did not expect was to throw the best party ever and have someone gatecrash it. Of course, the gatecrashee was an unconscious girl from the future who looked as though she had just been tortured into insanity. They also did not expect her to change their lives...

  She mustn't be seen. It was the oldest rule of time travel yet one of the hardest to follow. Hermione is thrown back to the start of her third year and the professor who'd always been there for her. Now with Sirius escaped from prison and Remus' entire past before him again, can she be there for him? And what happens once the year is over? NOW COMPLETE!
