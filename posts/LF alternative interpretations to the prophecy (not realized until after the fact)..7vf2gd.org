LF fics where everyone believes they know the correct interpretation of the prophecy and in the end something completely unexpected happens due to a different interpretation that no one thought of before it happened.


** The problem is that practically any interpretation has been done in a fic, from the power he knows not being multiple orgasms or familiar love up to it being an AWM sniper rifle or a Napalm Strike. So while surprising to the people in the universe, we, the readers, have certainly thought about it before and in 99% of the cases, the reveal is not as grandiose as the author intended it to be. Frankly, I cannot remember a single fic where the Power was outstanding enough to make an impression on me. Well, perhaps Unexpected Talent counts, but that is a cracky one-shot.

*** Well, the question of what the Power is has been done to death, but there could be room for interpretation in /other/ parts, no? Perhaps Harry's scar is not the "mark", perhaps the Prophecy actually referred to a completely different Dark Lord in another part of the world, etc.

**** Perhaps it's not even Harry. There's still another potential prophecy child hanging around, after all, and it's not like Voldemort never has the opportunity to mark Neville as his equal. He's at Hogwarts often enough. Everyone's convinced Harry is the one, but nothing says the Dark Lord can't make another accidental Horcrux, assuming that's even necessary.

Or another tack - who has the most opportunity to defy the Dark Lord? His Death Eaters! He gives them orders regularly. Say a Dark wizard couple thinks their last run of commands was stupid and ignores them, and suddenly their late-July kid is another candidate. Could be an interesting story there.

*** your point about the power he knows not might be true but its not like the rest of the prophecy is crystal clear either

**** I've read a fic where Parvati uses some Indian soul eviction magic because she's fed up with the war while Harry was chilling somewhere warmer so I'm pretty sure that most "alternative" interpretations are covered as well.

Parvati is born in July so the reinterpretation is who was the Chosen one. And the defiances happen after she was born.

  Harry can do something very few others can, it turns out. Which sparks an idea... I warn you now, this is entirely silly. And not at all canon. But it came to me more or less whole, made me laugh, then type it up, so you'll have to live with it...
