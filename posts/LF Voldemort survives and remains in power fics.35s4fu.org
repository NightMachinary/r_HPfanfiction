I recently finished [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2980054/1/The-Resistance-of-Azkaban][The Resistance of Azkaban]] An AU post HBP fix where the OoP is still fighting 25 years later.

I also really liked [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4062601/1/The-Wise-One-Book-One-Becoming][The Wise one]] where James and Lily survive and continue the fight.

Any recs would be greatly appreciated!


** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/288347?view_full_work=true][The Rewards of Perseverance]] - Oh man. This fic is devastating, that's really the only word for it. AU where Voldemort wins. Everything is terrible, but a few surviving members of the DA try to make a go of it.

** Probably best one is Prince of the Dark Kingdom, where Voldemort wins but doesn't lay waste to all the Muggleborns. Pretty good AU

You meant [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1248431/1/Promises-Unbroken][Promises Unbroken]], maybe?

Prince of the Dark Kingdom. I'm only about 30 chapters in but I'm really enjoying it so far.
