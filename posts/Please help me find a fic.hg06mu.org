:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
i tried adding more stuff than the previous one to try to help more i supposed. So the fic has harry as lord black/potter if i remember correctly at the start of the fic harry threatens to buy pansy from her father after she was being rude to him after which he made friends with daphne greengrass and tracy davis. Midway through the fic he and ginny hook up but he obliviates her due to her wanting to brag abt being in a relationship with him to her mother. Final few chapters has harry going to a pub where he uses sliver powder to kill greyback and all the werewolf in it he went to the pub in a disguise forgot the name and than voldemort wanted to recruit the disguise into the death eaters if i'm not wrong. idk the fic might have been purged but maybe it's on ao3 and if i rmb correctly he also is hooking up with lavender thx
