***** Hermione and Ginny were having lunch when Hermione brought up the argument. "Do have any idea what happened between Harry and Ron?"

Confused, Ginny shrugged, "Something happened?"

"Well." Hermione began, "Ron came home last in a huff. Apparently our two idiots had an argument about furniture."

"What...?" Was all Ginny could respond with. The idea that her husband or brother gave furniture a second thought was ludicrous.

Hermione continued, "It seems Ron got annoyed by the fact, how did he put it, that 'Harry gets into bed everynight'. Whatever that means."

Ginny choked on her drink.

  Harry Potter knows that money can give you power and influence. He has learned that from a young age on, seeing how his relatives get away with many things. And others having way much more than you do can be a problem. Thus he starts his path to cause a small revolution in its own right. No matter if Dumbledore doesn't like it. Two-shot.
