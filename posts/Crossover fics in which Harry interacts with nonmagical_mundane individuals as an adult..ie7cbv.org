It can be any series or movie as long as there is no magic other than that possessed by wizards and witches. No slash.


** I remember once reading a fic where Harry was the magical world's unofficial liaison to SHIELD and the Avengers. He was acquainted with Strange's people, but they weren't part of the plot.
