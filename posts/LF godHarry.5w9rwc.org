I remember reading a god!Harry story a few years ago where he made a world and creatures and shit inside it. If anyone has the link of it and/or any other stories like that I would appreciate it.

  Harry was born cursed, but didn't know until he fell through a portal to another world. There people have wings and hate him for his curse, but it gives him power: power to change this new world as well as his own. AU after 5th year.

  What if the Deathly Hallows were always meant for Harry? What if Harry was the reincarnation of the God of the Bible? What if getting the Deathly Hallows reawakened his powers as God? What if that meant Harry was the new God... we're all f*****! Crack fic. Slightly OP Harry.

  Death messed up his job at Halloween 1981 and now neither Voldemort nor Harry Potter are dead. As if that wasn't bad enough that noisy little brat appears to be able to see him. All of that was quite unexpected. Still it doesn't explain how he somehow found himself stuck to raise the baby. Alright, now that's just awkward. Complete (sort of)
