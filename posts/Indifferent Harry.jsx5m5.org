I'm craving some fics where Harry is particularly indifferent, and the ones I've found, are not particularly to my liking, or I've read too many times.

Crossovers are welcomed, I don't care about slash, but I just really don't like H/hr.

/Please/ include a link, if you don't know how to use the bot, copy and paste the link, it works.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

** In Chary Potter and the Years of Reluctance, Harry starts out as a pretty indifferent, reluctant kind of character, as a result of his crap childhood. But he developes care and motivation as he recovers so idk if that's what you're thinking of.
