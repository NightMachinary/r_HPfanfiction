Hi, I recently stopped being a student and have less time to read fanfiction, since I am working full time. Still, I work a desk job that allows us to use headphones and listen to music/podcasts. Any good suggestions on podcasts that read fanfiction?


** I use a text to speech app for it, for when I'm driving. Personally I use VoiceAloudReader, with the British Female voice option on my phone. I know it's not exactly what you're looking for, but it works well for me since there are so few audiobook fanfics.

** /[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_u3tka6q14][The Great Wizarding War]]/ (link is to first chapter) has got a shockingly good cast, including the perfect Book Voldemort.

** There's an audio podcast version of G Norman Lippert's James Potter series. It's pretty good... the story itself has some really odd bits, but it's ultimatelly well written and the narrator certaintly does a good job.
