To all the Daphne/Harry shippers out there, Dorothea Greengrass seems to have come out of her hiatus, or at least inconsistent upload schedule recently and has been churning out chapters and completed!

I didn't see anything in the rules about promoting a story in particular, and I guess this is really just a recommendation for those that have been looking for Daphne/Harry fics, and have been burned one too many times by the incompleted ones on forever hiatus!


** I marathoned this fic a couple of weeks ago and I'm really not sure why. It's well written for sure, but man, it's the most boring 300k word fic I've read. I think the short chapters helped me get through it.

Daphne's character in this is probably the most boring one I've read. Her character is that she loves Harry... and that's kinda it? I never really got the sense she was cunning, or anything like that. Even the 1000th take on the whole Ice Queen thing is more interesting.

Harry as a CEO of some magical company is just.. completely uninteresting. I don't feel like it fits his character at all. It's kinda hard to enjoy the romance aspect of the story when you don't feel particularly strong about either character.

The mystery is completely ruined by the fact that they just throw in PoV chapters telling you exactly what's going on as everything is happening. Remove those and it's atleast a solid mystery story.

I don't mean to bash it too much, It is well written and readable, better then 95% of fanfiction. The set up for the story is a decent take on the whole Marriage Contract trope, there's some good ideas there. I just don't think I'd have read it it wasn't a long, recently updated story while I've been on a Harry/Daphne kick.

As for incomplete/hiatus Haphne fics.. I really wish linkffn(10951430) gets updated sometime. That's easily the best Haphne romance I've read and one of the best in fanfic in general. It sucks it stopped getting updated when it began to pick up.

** I thought this was pretty interesting! I like the mystery vibe and the ending was good! I liked how there are hints and clues throughout the story to help you figure out and put details together.
