I was looking for some good fics with a ghost Voldemort. I read this really funny one a while back where Voldemort acts like Peeves to Harry for a bit....can't remember the name. Also one where Harry tried to get Voldemort to feel some remorse (don't remember the name either).


** I'm sure this isn't what you are looking for, but I read this story with a ghost Voldemort before. linkffn(6692090)

Not the focus of the story by a long shot, but does feature this. Quite cracky, given the author.
