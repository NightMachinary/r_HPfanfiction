(No clue how to flair this, if I need to change it please lmk)

I've had this idea for a story flow around in my mind of Harry and Hermione becoming dark wizards and planning coups on every type of government in existence. After thinning that down to something realistic (and some prompt searching on this subreddit) I've decided on a 3 (maybe 4) part story where Neville is the BWL but they don't figure it out until the graveyard. (Harry still kills basilisk, Voldy wraith, wins Triwizard, etc.) It begins in 6th year (Sirius is still alive) and Harry gets tutored by Dumbledore on politics (Dumbles wants him to use his Wizengamot seat to help Neville) but Harry convinces Dumbledore to let him help with Horcruxes. Hermione helps Draco in fixing the cabinet and Draco tells her about the Diadem (Voldy tells Lucius that when they kill Dumbledore, Lucius needs to make sure someone brings it back) and Harry, Draco, and Hermione plan a coup on the ministry, while using the diadem to keep Voldemort out of their way, while giving Dumbledore the impression they're helping Neville.

Obviously this won't be the entire plot, some stuff is just a bit too bland for my tastes and there's some characters that I want to add, plus I'm looking for some conflict ideas. I was just wondering if anyone wanted to help a guy out and bounce ideas back and forth (maybe even beta?). Eventually this will be posted on FFN but I usually don't write my first chapter until I get the story planned out.

Any help is appreciated, thank you!!


** I think that you have a really good idea for a fic! I'm not sure if I would be able to add much idea wise, but if you want to talk about some thoughts you have or if you need help proof reading/editing, I'm more than willing to help.

*** You're truly an amazing person. Do you have an email you could send me (in pm)? I do most of my work on google docs these days

** I'd be willing to work with you - just from your outline, I think I could throw in a few conflict ideas? It'd be my first time doing beta-work, but I'd enjoy playing ping-pong with a few ideas :)

*** Thank you so much! What I posted is basically my Part One, and I have a big sorta on my Part Three on what I want to happen, but as for the middle I'm pretty confused. At the end I want there to be a big battle between either A: Draco/Harry/Hermione versus Voldemort, B: Draco/Harry/Hermione vs Neville and Ron (our â€œlight), C: Draco/Harry/Hermione and Neville and Ron vs Voldemort, D: Draco/Harry/Hermione (definitely need a better name for these three) and Voldemort vs Neville and Ron, or our last option which is just a three way fight

I'm kinda basing these groups off of Sirius/Sturgis/Mulciber from Lesser Evils (so sad that that series was never finished, it was truly a work of art) because I want them to be able to work together without actually liking each other, yet still having trust. But that's beside the point. My main problem is having all this setup in part two. Do you have an email so I could show you the doc?

Edit: not the God of Death (though that series was amazing in its own right)

** Please do i like Neville as BWL. Great thing would be if you make Herminone so called brain of duo and Harry more like as muscle. Just dont do the usual perfect HHR where everybody is better than Merlin

*** Neville as BWL is one of my favorite types of tics, the first one I read had Harry older than Neville and Harry was paired with I think Fleur? (I get this story and one where Harry's dark and paired with a OC named Miranda Rookwood, which is a beautiful piece of work and one of my top 10's but not this fic I think) anyway Harry was at this dueling tournament with Neville and Neville was written horribly but the story was amazing so it made up for it.

As for Harry and Hermione, I plan on having them as equals almost. They both have their strong points and their weak points and for the most part they cover each other well. Draco was honestly added as an afterthought.

** This may actually be easier if they first meet before Hogwarts. I remember a Star Wars xover that's similar where Hermione decides to go Sith and drags Harry into it, but I don't remember much of it. If they start that 2-3 years before Hogwarts, and they hold the urge back while planning until 5th or 6th year, then it might be decent. I can't see either going into Griffyndor for this, though.

I'm thinking having them in Ravenclaw is a better idea. Trying to make Star Wars real would likely be a good reasoning to use.

*** I thought about having them meet earlier than Hogwarts, but I'm not near enough familiar with the culture/location of Britain to make that believable, plus my original idea of them going dark revolves around the horcrux and the time period where Ron runs off in the forest. I just honestly couldn't find a way to make that work that I liked while still keeping Neville as BWL, so I scratched that. Plus, I'm a fan of a gradual fall. Not something you can tell chapter by chapter, but where you can definitely feel a difference if you skip ahead five chapters, and I think I can make that work
