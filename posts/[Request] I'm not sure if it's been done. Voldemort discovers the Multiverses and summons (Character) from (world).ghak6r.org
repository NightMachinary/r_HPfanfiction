Or maybe he discovers he's a fictional character and summons other fictional characters?

I'd prefer it if the bad guys win, but anything works. It can either be a hard won fight or a total overkill. (Summoning a Gold Saint is probably *Overkill* anyway)

Just make sure it's complete, please?


** Can't think of anything thats complete but there is [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/salve-worm-hp.353642/][Salve]] where DE's summon Bonesaw (mass murdering little girl) from worm and she starts living with the Malfoys.

** I don't know of any stories like this sorry. It would be fun to see something like: Voldemort uses a dark ritual to summon an all powerful being to do his bidding. Darquesse obeys no one, especially if they don't have a nose.

*** Darquesse would probably obsess over the new magic system, learning everything she can with her flawless memory (didn't she mention that once?): it contradicts her entire worldview of â€˜people are energy=this chair is a person' when legitimate souls actually exist, alongside memories and /oh god,/ horcruxes. Voldemort would be /slaughtered/ by Darquesse, though.
