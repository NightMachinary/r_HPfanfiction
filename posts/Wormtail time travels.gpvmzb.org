I think Peter time traveling back in time and wanting to change his ways would make sense. he knows that Voldy isn't good for him right? and that he is the reason why his life pretty much sucked. so what if he came back to the marauders era in school and decided not to join the death eaters because that is the reason he dies anyway? I don't know the canon reason why he even joined. I always suspected he actually became a traitor because James and Sirius bullied him. they seem the type. but anyway...

at first he would be selfish, just doing it for himself. so the fic would follow an anti hero, but then he would change with time and actually start being real friends with the other three. and then decides that he has to fight the dark lord cause he doesn't want him to win anymore.

anyone read fic like that before?
