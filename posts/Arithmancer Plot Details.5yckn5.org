Did anybody else get discouraged from reading The Arithmamcer by White Squirrel because of the similarities to canon plot wise? I'm interested in the character change Hermione has gone through, but don't see the point if it follows the same plot as canon. Does it branch off anytime soon? I've read half way through first year at this point.


** It finally left canon plot rail in the middle of Year 6.

**** Yes.

I personally like the Animagus series a lot more.

White Squirrel certainly knows how to develop original plots, and she does them extremely well.

But for the Arithmancer series, she made a conscious decision to stick with canon stations. Some people will like it, some not.

***** I agree. She's a talented writer, however he adherence to the stations of canon is for me the only downside to an otherwise fine story.

****** To me the main downside is how infuriatingly ordinary Harry is. At least up to the beginning of Lady Archimedes. You're going to tell me that Hermione is a brilliant Arithmancer? Awesome. You uplifted Ron into a decent student in Runes? Man that's really cool, what did you do for Harry? Oh, he's a bit less moody and way more dependent on Hermione. I also crippled his ability to learn anything he needs to learn, once he's sure he needs it. Now when the pressure is on and he needs it most, sometimes he chokes.

******* I get the impression with White Squirrel that she deliberately takes common tropes, cliches, and fandom specific plots in Harry Potter and aims to subvert them or write them as well as possible.

Think about it. The Arithmancer is basically just the 'Hermione knows everything' cliche given new life, The Accidental Animagus is loaded with early-Animagus, wandless magic, politics, Harry-gets-adopted-by-someone-else, family Gringotts vaults, all woven together in a way that's actually good. Her new one is the 'someone finds the Harry Potter books' plot given a makeover too.

So with Ron being good at Ancient Runes, she's just subverting Ron-bashing by making Ron a genuinely competent and likable character.

I just read the story on your recommendation, and I'd have to contest that. I couldn't get through to the beginning of first year because of the flurry of cliches that weren't used in particularly good ways. I didn't see anything particularly impressive about her writing Harry getting a black belt before the age of 11, or about Harry and Hermione developing wandless magic as young children, or about Hermione's parents being named Dan and Emma Granger for the n-th story in a row...

It just reads like a really formulaic HHr adoption/Super!Harry story. In fact, I didn't see a single scene that wouldn't be seen in the probably-two-dozen other >100k word stories in the genre until... I want to say, the last scene of chapter 13? The one with the cute Twins scene. And by chapter 14, we're back to the same trite, formulaic events again, with Harry holding conversations in ultra-formal Pureblood Style, then dropping it and admitting he doesn't like talking so formally very much, at which point his conversation partner responds with relief and gratitude- come now, how many times have we read through that exact same scene in other stories?

******** I'm not disputing that. But she also took the "harry is useless sometimes" impression people can get from canon, and turned it up to 11 by taking out a fair few of his redeeming qualities. And highlighted it by making everyone else more competent. So this major supporting character who is usually the main character in my reading is brave and a good flyer and supposedly likeable, though I don't really see why. But he's the slow kid that the rest of them just put up with. At best, he's ordinary. And that just annoys me to all hell to read, which is a shame because I'm enjoying the rest of it.

********* I normally defend Hermione-centric fics and /Arithmancer/ in particular, but, yeah, there's at least one cringeworthy moment I can remember off the top of my head where Harry shouldn't have needed Hermione's help. I even wrote the author about that. (Perhaps I should've volunteered to beta-read back when the fic was getting started. I don't know if White Squirrel would have accepted, though.)

********** The one that sticks out to me is that he can't learn the bubble head charm. Oh, he'll learn the patronus (probably NEWT level or higher) just so he can play quiddich, but he cant learn the OWL level bubble head to save his life?

*********** I don't have that much of a problem with Bubblehead Charm. (He didn't use it in canon, either.) I suspect that he might have actually been able to cast it, but would he bet his very life on being able to sustain it deep under water for several hours, while focused on other things and possibly fending off attacks?

The bit that comes to mind for me was when Draco casts some slipperiness spell (or something like that) that sends Harry falling over the railing of some staircase, and Hermione casts a cushioning charm on the ground. Harry's a talented athlete, with excellent reflexes and dexterity. He would not fall, he would not need Hermione to save him in this case.

** White Squirrel is a great writer but that's basically my biggest complaint with that story. During fourth year there's actually an A/N where she writes something like "Haha did you really expect me to put Hermione into the tournament?" .... and I was just... why didn't you? It would have been cool and at least somewhat unique and would have put canon on its head.

Generally IMHO fanfic writers should embrace the "Rule of Cool" more... I'm willing to go along with the most flimsy of justifications if it gets the story, plot and characters into a cool place. But most people seem too afraid to try something like this... and maybe there's a good reason for that. As others in this thread have pointed out, it requires a much higher level of writing talent to do something like this.

** The Arithmancer starts to get into plot divergence nearer the end. If you want real plot divergence, you need to slog your way through and read the sequel Lady Archimedes. The sequel still follows some of the events from canon but it gets pretty divergent.

** No, because quite frankly, a lot of fanfiction writers can't write a good, coherent, and balanced plot with characters that are powerful like Hermione in The Arithmancer. Besides, her math skills and experimentation do enough to make it nice to read.
