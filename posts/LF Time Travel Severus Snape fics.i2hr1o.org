:END:
The most time travel fanfictions are about Hermione, Harry,... , but I would prefer Severus Snape back in time too. He's back in Harry's first year/ childhood would be really interesting xx


** The only one iv read is linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9552519/1/Reboot]]) reboot by Kallanit this is a harry hermione and snape time travel fic where snape goes back to before he and lilly meet to change how every thing happened. Harry and Hermione go back to just before first year.

Edit made the link work.

** The vast majority of Snape time travel fics are Marauder-era ones. Since this is clearly not what you're asking for, I'll link the few I know that aren't:

linkffn(Fixing Past Mistakes) -- Snape travels back to roughly 1982-1984 (I forgot the exact year, it was years ago I read this fic) and raises Harry outside Britain after it is shown that his current living arrangements was clearly unsuitable (to the point where he'd have died).

linkffn(To Shape and Change) -- Snape travels back to Harry's first year and takes on a mentoring role for him.

I also recall a fairly short fic where Snape and Harry both travels back to the end of First Year (accidentally) and go Horcrux hunting together, but I don't remember the title of the fic and was unable to find it with search...

  Harry didn't appear at Hogwarts causing concern. Albus immediately head's out to Privet Drive to find out what was going on, along with Minerva and a reluctant Severus Snape. What they find out changes everything for everyone in the wizarding world. Is there a chance for anyone to go back and fix past mistakes? is there any hope at all for the magical world? COMPLETE

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9552519/1/Reboot]])

A Reptilia28 challenge-type fic. Harry, Hermione, and Snape all get sent back in time - well, Snape gets sent back furthest - it meets your criteria. You might like it.

  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. Some character bashing. No Cursed Child or Fantastic Beasts. COMPLETE.
