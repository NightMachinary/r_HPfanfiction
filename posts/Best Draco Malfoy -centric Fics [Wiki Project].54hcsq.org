** Genre: Angst/Hurt/Comfort

Link: linkffn(Exile by bennybear)

Status: <In Progress>

Thoughts About It: Alright, so this picks up immediately after the Battle of Hogwarts, and is all about Draco trying to figure out who he is and what he believes as he comes to turn with everything that happened in basically his entire life. This fic is notable because it has the pathetic, whiny, father's boy Draco of canon instead of some brilliant, skilled Slytherin sex god. I first started reading this about a year ago, I think, and it has had 4 or 5 updates since then, so it has a couple times a year update rate, which while not the greatest is definitely not the worst.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

Link: linkffn(harry potter and the puppet of time)

Status: In Progress

Thoughts About It: The author writes very cynically. Not in the "lots of torture and death" sense, but in the "everything is inevitably doomed, the world is a cold dark void" cosmic horror sense.

  Time travel. It's always about Potter. Draco Malfoy doesn't like that fact, but there is no one else who has the power to change the world. Sending his memories to his younger self he hopes to create a better future. Intelligent Grey Draco. No slash.

** /Winter's Debt/: Old story, written pre-OoTP, so Draco is somewhat OoC. The premise is that Draco has a younger sister, who has been hidden away by his father. This is one of the few fics that humanise Draco without redeeming him. Oneshot. linkffn(1245134)

/The Malfoy Case/: Draco/Astoria. Post War Legal Drama, Astoria is Draco's advocate. Very well done redemption arc. linkffn(10202355)

/Draco Malfoy and the Trials of single Parenthood/: Really well written family fic that takes place two months after Astoria's death. Some touching father-son moments between Draco and Scorpius. Draco and Ron friendship, too. It works surprisingly well. linkffn(12089286)

/The House that Cedric Built/: Eighth year fic. The premise is that all the returning seventh years form a new Hogwarts house, the Diggory house, in Cedric's memory. This is one of the few house unity fics that doesn't feel cheesy or contrived. linkffn(6406102)

/Traitorous Hearts/: Draco/Astoria DH fic. Has a shaky start in terms of writing and dialogue, but gets better as the story progresses. linkao3(6671233)

/The albatross did follow/: Ginny's a curse breaker who's been tasked to find a missing Draco Malfoy. Time travel with infinite time loop. linkffn(11128944)

/Bend it Like Weasley/: Draco coaches a new all-girls quidditch team at Hogwarts. Started before OotP. Complete. linkffn(1349676)

** Snakes and Lions is my favorite fic featuring Draco. It's a Harry/Draco friendship, with very light slash close to the end. The sequel is somewhat slashy though.

linkffn(1343968)

It's complete.

I like it a lot, because it gives an interesting, almost intuitive portrayal of the social interactions in Hogwarts. As well, the fics tangles lightly with a few philosophical concepts - like what friendship trully means and the merits/downsides of utilising dark magic.The characters are alive and heastrong, and the setting feels magical. The pacing is fluid and characterization superb.

It's a sixth year fic, published just before OttP came out.
