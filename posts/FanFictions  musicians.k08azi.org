Hi everyone! I'm looking for Harry Potter Fanfictions with characters depicted as musicians. I know it's quite a peculiar request, but I'm confident there is something.

Tnx in advance!


** I only know two.

The first is Rockstar by Jeconais. It's on Fanficauthors.

The second I can't link, due to rule 8. It's only very lightly suggestive, to the tune of "We went upstairs and had a great thirty minutes together" and Fleur starts off with no idea that Harry is underage, but it has Harry and Fleur bonding over music and it's a relatively big thing for them. It's called Ingenio ab Artifex and it's by JaimeJabs. The link to their profile is below.

** Oddly specific but... also I've written this so...
