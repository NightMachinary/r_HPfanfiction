ones and Officer Smith were normal policemen. They were fine with pulling over people and dealing with the occasional hold up at a convenience store but they had never dealt with something like this. Jones didn't think they ever would again. It all started when they were sitting in their car, watching for speeders on a long straight road that the county still hadn't managed to start building speed bumps for. Across the road from them three kids came out of the woods. They looked disheveled and all had a crazy glint in their eyes. And, Smith noted with some curiosity, they were all tightly gripping sticks. Smith and Jones looked at each other, discussed it for a couple seconds, and then decided that Smith would go talk to them while Jones stayed in the car. Smith reluctantly began crossed the street to the kids, but midway one of them raised his stick. The girl screamed "You can do it Harry, come on!" Smith called out "Look Harry, I'm not sure what you're trying to do but it won't work with that stick of yours." Suddenly the boy with the raised stick screamed "Expecto Patronum!" Nothing happened. They all paused. Smith sighed. And then suddenly a stag came tearing out of the woods. It sprinted across the street and slammed into Jones using its antlers. It caught him on them and twisted its head, throwing him onto the hood of the police car, where Jones was freaking out. He kicked open the door and shot the stag repeatedly before turning towards the kids. They were sprinting back into the woods, but one paused and turned around. He screamed "Sectum Semperum" and threw his stick. It flew through the air and stuck in Jones eye. He fell to the ground screaming. Two more victims of the magic kids.

Harry woke up, coughing, as the sunlight reached his eyelids. He wiped the sweat from his face with his blanket and sat, holding his head in his hands.

He was desperately trying to cling onto his dream. It was about something really important. But his old Nokia made a sound, interrupting him, and he tilted his head to read the screen - "17 unread messages from: Hans van Voldemort". His stomach twisted as reality came back to him. If he didn't get Voldemort's money by the end of the day, he was fucked.

He staggered to his feet and into the next room where Dumbledore was asleep wrapped in three coats. He shook him - 'Dumbledore wake up. What the fuck am I going to do. Voldemort's going to -' 'Fucks sake Harry. Don't wake me up like that.' Dumbledore rocked himself upright and shook himself awake, before brushing a greasy curl of hair out of his eyes and lighting the butt of a roll-up from the floor. 'Harry I didn't tell you before but I've found something a bit special. It'll take your mind right off Voldemort. Cook this up for us will you.'

Harry went about preparing the syringe, wiping last night's blood away. Dumbledoor sat and alternated between smoking and coughing until everything was ready. 'You go first', said Dumbledore, 'you look like you need to forget your problems.'

'Yeah, I just need a little pick me up so I can think straight, and work out what to do', slurred Harry. As his eyes rolled back into his skull, the last thing he saw was the syringe in his twitching hand.

He sank back into his dream. It all came back to him. He was young again. The warehouse turned into his old school. Everything was magical, everyone loved him, and he had incredible powers. But he couldn't forget his problems. His memories of Voldemort, the police, his old boss, the school bully, all twisted into terrible nightmares and chased him deep into his mind, stalking him, lurking behind every corner.

Dumbledore gathered up his stuff and left after he couldn't wake Harry up a day later. He didn't know what Voldemort was after Harry for, but he didn't want to be there to find out. Harry was still lying in a pool of sweat and urine, gibbering gently into his pillow. Dumbledore looked back over his shoulder with a twinge of remorse, necked the dregs of his warm beer, and closed the door of the warehouse behind him.

permalinkembedsavereportgive goldreply [--]EquanimityInDefeat [score hidden] 2 hours ago "Ay! Use dat spellar 'Arry! Blimey! demun'or is coming. Nuff said, yeah?"

The Redhead's cockney shout made Harry spring up to his feet. He pointed his syringe at the approaching police.

"Awright geeezzaa! Adavakedava. Sorted mate. "

The cops stopped. They looked at each other exchanging confused glances.

"Rattle an' Hum on Harry quick let's escape. OK?" Hermione said.

The three huddled under a cloak.

"Demun'or can't see us now. OK?" Hermione was proud of herself.

"Blimey! Stupid girl. They can still hear us now, OK?" Ron snapped.

"Oy, you kids? Where do you live? Come here."

The kids made a run for it.

"Quickey, eh maybe we can make it to da Hogwarts shield. The demun'or can't enter there OK."

A homeless guy came out of a cul-de-sac as the kids sped through the backalleys.

"Howdy officers," he greeted them. They shoved him aside and raced after the kids.

"Ow no! They broke through the shield? The headmaster is fallen."

Harry stopped in grief. The other two tried to drag him on but the cops had already caught up to them.

"What are yew gonna do ter us you soulless monsters."

They dragged them back to their car.

"Get you kids into juvies, where you'll go through deaddiction."

"If you do that we won't tell you how to catch you know who," Hermine said, some sense wearing into her.

"What did you say?"

"That's right. The one who must not be named. The one who sells hallucinogens to us kids- the lynchping. Getting us small fries will do you now, would it?"

The officers stopped.

"You mean you can lead us to this... you-know-who?"

The three nodded.

The officers were tempted by the proposal. Getting some jacked up kids from the curb or nailing the big daddy? They quickly exchanged glances and decided on the latter.

"Alright now, punks. Maybe if you quit your drugs and get us this guy, maybe we'll try some lenience on your chargesheet."

The three kids were let off. Their new mission was to find and destroy Tom Riddle, who went by the street name Voldermort.

permalinkembedsavereportgive goldreply [--]XcessiveSmash[[/r/XcessiveWriting]] [score hidden] 3 hours ago* "Johnson, we got another code five oh seven."

It was all I could do to not bang my head against my desk. Repeatedly. "Rick, does it have to be me?"

The portly man turned to me and said sympathetically. "Sorry Matt, but it does. After your little 'drug bust' turned out to be glitter for a first-grader, chief has made it clear you get every job on the shit-list."

I was still convinced we had been duped on that job, but I kept my mouth shut. Last time I brought it up chief Vick had almost fired me. I sighed deeply and got up. Code 507 meant that the trio had been sighted again. It happened so often that we had separate code just for them.

Grumbling, I left the police station and went to my cruiser. I spoke into the radio, "where was the last sighting, Rick?"

"Near the Goldman Sachs international building, near..." he paused, probably pulling up a map, "Ah...near the intersection of fleet street and Fetter lane. Good luck, man," he finished, completely insincerely.

I could just see him wearing that smug little smile on his face in my head. I said something impolite and turned off the radio.

I drove through the crowded street of London. These assholes couldn't have picked any other time than 4 pm? Traffic was moving at crawl.

This was the fifth call this month. They were always causing some public disruption or other, thinking they were "wizards." They actually had wooden sticks that they claimed vigorously were their wands. They weren't insane I was pretty sure. They were just high. Constantly. I was pretty sure they were high 90 percent of he time. The times we were called in was just when they were bad enough that people bothered to call the police.

I finally arrived at the building, and sure enough, the three were standing there...under a bed sheet.

Why me?

I parked my cruiser by the curb and started moving towards them. They whispered among themselves excitedly, as if trying to keep their voices low. I finally walked up to them. "Erm...what the hell are you doing?"

The short one, made shhh noise to the rest, still not coming out of the sheet. My freaking life. "I can see you, you know. And hear you."

A series of gasps went up from them, and I pulled the sheet from them.

"You can see past the invisibility cloak?!" The short one seemed genuinely shocked.

"No," I explained gently, "this is just a normal sheet." With some suspicious looking stains on it.

"Ha!" Now the girl was talking. "You probably have some sort of counter-spell, this cloak was given to Harry by Dumbledore himself, and he would never lie."

Oh right, the ever present Dumbledore. He was an insane guy. But also insanely rich. I'm pretty sure he was the one who provided them with drugs for his own sick amusement. Of course they trusted him completely.

"No, I've told you," fighting to keep myself calm, "Dumbledore is either insane, or a liar. Probably both."

"Whatever, I'll let you guys off this time, standing under a sheet his hardly worth arresting you guys for." Plus the paperwork would be hell.

Before I could say anything else the short one said screamed, "Stupefy!" and threw a rock at me.

I cursed as the rock struck me in the nose. Hard. I blinked tears out of my eyes and the girl yelled, "RUN!"

It could never be easy.

I took after them as they sprinted away. I was catching up to them when they got on some metal scooters, they called them "broomsticks" and sped away.

I stopped running, I would never catch them now, they would disappear into the side streets.

Whatever. It really wasn't worth it. I went back to the station, reporting I had never found them. Rick saw me when I came back in.

"I thought you were catching junkies, not getting plastic surgery, Matt."

"Shut up, Rick," I said irritably and went to get an ice pack.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply [--]Impossibear94 78 points 4 hours ago “Expeliarmus, Expeliarmus Harry.” Hermione whispered to herself as she warmed her glass pipe filled with crack-cocaine.

Ron sat next to Hermione on Harry's torn, raggedy couch. His eyes were grey and lifeless. Every once in a while he could be heard muttering to himself. It seemed that his magic wand wasn't working quite right for him. It kept on backfiring spells.

Harry paced the dirty room in front of him. His eyes were wild, and there were rough, purple bruises on his right forearm. The room was cluttered, and filled with trash and old takeaway food. Bottles of brown liquor and cigarette butts littered the coffee table in front of Hermione and Ron.

“We gotta go get Dumbledore!” Harry yelled, suddenly turning towards his two friends.

Ron jumped up off of the couch. His eyes unfocused. “Only Dumbledore will know how to get rid of Dementors.” He said.

The two burst out of Harry's apartment, leaving Hermione behind on the couch. She told them to go ahead, she needed to spend time in the library to study for their next exams. She took a long drag of her pipe.

“She's always busy studying.” Harry said as Ron and him left the apartment building and found themselves on the street.

“I don't get it. I could study just as hard as her, and never be good at magic at all.” Ron complained.

The two shambled down the street. They were dressed in rags, and their shoes were worn thin.

“No Ron, you're great at magic. Just so great at magic.” Harry replied absentmindedly. It was hard for him to focus on Ron. A thousand different ideas were rushing through his mind.

The two stumbled into a nearby alleyway. They followed the smell of piss and alcohol until they found Dumbledore sleeping in a pile of rubbish. The homeless man was a booze fiend, and had taught Ron, Hermione, and Harry everything they knew about magic.

“Dumbledore. Dumbledore!” Harry yelled, kicking the filthy homeless man.

Dumbledore stuttered, and looked up at the two boys with bloodshot eyes. It took him a couple of moments to regain his grasp on reality.

“Oh, boys, boys. It's so good to see you.” Dumbledore said, slowly sitting up. His hands absentmindedly rummaged through the trash surrounding him, looking for a drop of liquor hidden away somewhere in the rubbish.

“Dumbledore. We need a new spell! We've gotten tired of our old one.” Ron whined.

“Oh boys, boys, I've got just the thing.” Dumbledore replied, reaching a shaking hand into his coat pocket. He produced a small, dirty plastic bag, wrapped in saran wrap. A brown powder could be seen through the layers of plastic.

“But first.” Dumbledore replied, batting away Ron and Harry's greedy hands. “You must understand the responsibility of magic. It is not some plaything to be used willy nilly. It must be treated with respect, and only used in your greatest time of need.”

“Of course, of course.” Harry replied, rushed. He threw forty quid at Dumbledore's feet, and snatched the baggie of heroin from Dumbledore's hands.

Ron and Harry left Dumbledore in the alleyway, and rushed back to Harry's apartment. Hermione was passed out on the couch, busy with her studies. Harry and Ron snuck off to Harry's bedroom, and were soon trying out their newest spell, Drugseptiem Overdosis.

In a matter of minutes, they were transported to the grand halls of Hogwarts, and were in a fever pitch battle with their greatest nemesis, Lord Voldemort.

Harry's phone buzzed as the two were passed out. His mother, J.K. Rowling, was calling. She was writing a new book that was going to make her filthy rich, and she liked to call her son and use some of his crazy stories as inspiration for her writing.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply [--]inkfinger[[/r/Inkfinger]] 701 points 4 hours ago* "Hey kids, you got fifty bucks?" Dennis asked the three teenagers giggling softly on the street corner.

He saw them hanging around often enough, always tripping out of their minds. Perhaps they were high enough to give him more than usual, tonight.

"Fifty points to Gryffindor! You hear that?" the boy with the unkempt black hair yelled. "We won the House Cup, Ron! Dumbledore said so!"

"Yes, yes, well done. And it's Dennis, remember?" he said, but the kids didn't listen. The girl with the bushy hair just shoved a bill in his hand, weeping with joy as she did so.

Dennis grinned to himself - he'd long since learned that playing along with whatever they were babbling about paid off handsomely.

Suddenly, the girl rose unsteadily to her feet and pointed down the street.

"Look at that, Harry! What are those dementors doing?"

A couple of policemen were crowded around a man waving a knife, in the midst of what looked like a robbery gone wrong. One of them suddenly tackled the man to the ground. Dennis shook his head to himself: the Hogwarn neighbourhood really was such a dodgy area. He often wondered how these kids had wound up here in the first place.

"Right, I'm going over there," Harry said, getting to his feet and promptly falling over on top of the red-headed boy, who yelped with pain.

"You stay in the hospital wing, Ron, you're not well," the girl said, tugging Harry's hand and helping him up. They stumbled along down the street as the red-headed boy passed out.

Dennis followed quietly: they were really far gone tonight. Part of him was concerned - he'd grown fond of the delinquent little assholes, despite them never remembering his name. Another part knew there was probably more money in it for him, tonight, if he followed them.

The cops looked agitated - the man with the knife was now slumped on the ground.

"He's passed out. Is he faking? What the hell's going on?" one demanded.

"I don't know, maybe something happened when he hit the ground. I'm performing CPR to be safe, but the bastard might be faking it," another grunted, and crouched down, looping his hand around the back of the man's head and leaning down.

"Noooo, stoppit, don't take his soul. Espeto Patroni...no, that's not right...expect a patronising...what is it again, Hermione?" Harry moaned, stumbling forward and tripping over his feet.

"What are you doing?" a detective snapped, trying to push the boy away. "Get lost, kid. This is serious!"

"Sirius!" Harry wept, as the girl gave a soft scream and clapped her hands to her mouth.

Dennis grabbed hold of them both and led them away, muttering a half-hearted excuse to the red-faced detective.

They both looked so miserable he felt a little sorry for them. He sighed at his own generosity but dug in his coat pocket and produced the grimy fifty-dollar bill he'd taken off them earlier.

"Here. Take this for uhm...bravery. Fifty points, right?" he said, shoving it at the boy. "Go buy a bus ticket home, kids. Your parents must be worried."

"Merlin's beard, Dumbledore, his parents are dead, you should know that," Hermione whispered, rubbing at her bloodshot eyes and looking deeply disappointed in him as the boy wept harder.

For some reason, he felt guilty at that. Perhaps he should make an effort to understand better. Besides, they looked like they were having fun, waving those little sticks in their hands like they were powerful weapons. It must be pretty good weed.

"What are you kids taking, anyway?" he asked.

The girl looked surprised and turned out her pockets. Out fell many little sacks of pale-brown powder.

"Chocolate," she winked at him, trying to tap her nose and failing. "For the dementors, you know.."

Dennis felt his mouth go dry. Holy hell. He'd assumed weed: just think of the money he could score from all that. His earlier good intentions to befriend the kids evaporated.

He grabbed the product from the girl's hands. "Great. Great, I'll go uhm...use it against them, shall I?"

"Of course," Hermioned nodded affably. "That's a good idea. You're a great wizard, Dumbledore."

He sprinted away, leaving the two teenagers swaying in the road. He seemed to be running in the opposite direction as the dementors, but that was alright. Dumbledore would never fail them.

"Great man, Dumbledore," Harry muttered, drooping against Hermione. "Let's go...wake Ron. Where's Ron?"

They turned to see a single dementor closing in on Ron, who was gesturing wildly in the night. He seemed to be clutching a rat he'd caught to his chest. They could faintly hear him yelling 'Scabbers! You're alive!'.

"We should...hurry..." Harry muttered, feeling incredibly tired suddenly. "That thing could suck out his soul."

"Don't be silly, Harry, Ron is perfectly safe," Hermione said, leaning forward to whisper in his ear. "He's a ginger, you know."

They blinked at one another and then burst into peels of laughter, drawing the astonished gazes of the people hurrying by. You rarely heard laughter in Hogwarn, or saw kids roaming around after daylight, for that matter. It was a pretty crazy place.
