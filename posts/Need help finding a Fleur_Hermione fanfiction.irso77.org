There was Fleur/Hermione story in Archive of our own where after the war Hermione traveled around and settled in Brazil. She finally went back to Hogwarts after receiving multiple letters to teach there or something. In the story she has a bird and Fleur is also a professor at Hogwarts. I had forgotten the name of the story and need help finding it.
