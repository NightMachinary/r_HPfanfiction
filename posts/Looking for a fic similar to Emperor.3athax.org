Really thoroughly enjoyed [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]] by Marquis Black, it's not finished yet but loved what I could read of it so far. Would any of you astute gentlemen and gentleladies know of any similar fics?

Many thanks!


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8149841/1/Again-and-Again][Again and Again]] (W: 226,768; Abandoned) is a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogPeggySue][Groundhog Peggy Sue]] in which a desperate Harry tries aligning himself with Voldemort in order to gain political power, as much and quickly as possible. Warning for HP\TR slash and for a Voldemort that later into the story develops a teenage girl personality.

There's also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10267302/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Dark-s-Rise][HP & the Dark's Rise]] (W: 206,192; Complete) but its quality is subpar.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp
