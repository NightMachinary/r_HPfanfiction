I'm looking for a fan fiction that I read between probably 4-8 years ago. It's a James and Lily Potter story, kind of angsty. The main point I can remember is that James had a little sister who died, which is why he was troubled/dark/etc. She died by spinning around in her mother's dress by a fire and caught on fire. (I'm pretty sure something happened at school where he couldn't use his wand at home, maybe? I forget that part.) My memory could have morphed this fanfic into something else over the years, but I remember it being a favourite and wanted to reread it. Any help would be appreciated, thank you!! (I think it was on Fanfiction.net or harrypotterfanfiction.com) Let me know if you need more information.


** No idea! The Life and Times by Jewels5 is an amazing Jily though.

** I think it sounds kind of familiar but I used to read a lot of J/L back in the day. I'll look through my story alerts and see if anything pops out.
