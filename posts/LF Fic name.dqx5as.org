:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
All I remember about it is that it's from Neville's POV and it involves an older Harry Potter coming back in time during the Department of Mysteries battle in fifth year. It's been bugging me for the last few days, I just can't seem to find this fic anywhere, but I remember reading it a while ago.


** Sounds like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6763981/1/][The Dark Lord's Equal]] to me.

#+begin_quote
  Years after the Epilogue things look bleak; Harry Potter agrees to go back to the Ministry Battle to change history for the better. Premise; "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think. Fight scenes, humour, romance, magic, and insanity. FINISHED
