Harry wants to go to Hogwarts. He just has to convince aunt Petunia who was not impressed by the Adidas-clad giant offering cheap vodka to an 11-year-old boy. 'I'm afraid we have to decline your kind offer', said aunt Petunia. 'We've already registered Harry at Smeltings where he will actually enjoy a good education.'

I really want to read a fanfic where Hogwarts teaches magic Gopnik style and everyone wears Adidas tracksuits. Also, Petunia is actually a somewhat decent human being who treats her nephew with some dignity, even if it's only to preserve the Dursley's good reputation.

Excuse my garbage English.


** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27603932/chapters/67530086]]) has a similar idea but with rednecks instead. I would explain more but I don't think it's really possible without reading the story. It's really cracky.

********* Harry looked at the large squatting man curiously. He had a bushy black beard and a mane of hair tucked into a flat cap. His frame was covered by an Adidas tracksuit that had enough material for a sail. He smiled at Harry and began to root through his backpack, eventually pulling a small clear bottle labeled Luksusowa.

'I almost forgot it was your birthday Harry.' Hagrid said, offering him the bottle.

'What is it?' Harry asked curiously.

'The best way to celebrate a birthday!'

That's all you get. I'm not a great writer.
