I know this question is kinda dumb but like idk. I write a MoD fic and Harry is kinda immortal and it is by no means crack or so but sometimes I'm like. What if he just fell down the moving staircases. I could do it. There is no one stopping me.

  "I can't go back, can I?“ Harry asked after a while."Do you want to?“ Death asked instead of answering. Harry stayed quiet."I could choose to go on,“ he said after some time."You could,“ Death replied and paused for a moment. Then he started to talk again. “But there is something you want more than that, don't you?”“What do you mean?” Harry asked as he let his hands wander over the back of a bench."A second chance,“ Death said. Harry stopped and turned around to look at the being. “I cannot simply bring back the dead. But If you were my Master, I could bring you back to the dead." Twenty-four-year old Harry Potter feels like something is missing in his life. When Death offers him a second chance, he takes it.Accompanied by the being, Harry travels back to the summer before Sirius dies. Inside his younger body and the memories of an older self, Harry realizes, that being connected to Death may have twisted his morals a little more than expected.And while the Ministry could use a change; this time he won't let himself being used in this war. Neither by Dumbledore nor anyone else.
