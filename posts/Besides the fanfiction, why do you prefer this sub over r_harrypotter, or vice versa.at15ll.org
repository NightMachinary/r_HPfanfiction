Personally, this sub is less biased and more open-minded to discussion -- for the most part, I am not hesitant to share my opinion on something in HP canon.

E.g. If I want to say that Harry should NOT have ended up with Ginny and why, I am a lot less likely to be downvoted.

Additionally, instead of simply singing praise of canon, this sub really delves into canon and /breaks it down/, usually to make it better. What about you: which do you prefer, and why?


** I only like the main sub during discussion week because otherwise it's just low effort memes, pictures of generic tattoos, and people fishing for karma by posting pictures of their dogs.

But, I do like it during discussion week. As someone with little interest in AU stuff, I sometimes feel a little bit seperate from the main crowd here, so the other sub suits me a little more. But only on discussion weeks.

****** Not to get into depressing territory, but watching and imagining fictional people have happy fictional, functional relationships with their peers or just other people in general might be a way to counter teenage angst? Hell, reading these excerpts put a smile in my face and I'm like "I agree with these intepretations and adding them into my perspectives of the aforementioned characters deepen my understanding of these characters, deepen my emotional bonds with them and sustain my investment in the series"

And well, what harm does it do for them to imagine other traits and things that could be extrapolated from what is seen in canon? I mean what you show us is the authors imagining James being exuberent and attention-seeking, Lily being studious, James and Sirius being teenage brats in response, Lupin going along with the flow, Peter not doing it well, and then James covering for his buddy Lupin who just had to undergo another shitty night because of his "condition" None of these characterizations are too far removed from what the canon and people in canon would describe the Marauders and Lily as in school, and yet to the authors, it means the books awoke something in them and got them invested in the series and the characters in response.

And well, let's not go all gatekeeping on their interpretations and wonder if that is the right way to enjoy HP. They write a few hundred words of intepretations, we write thousands of words here so really who are the real weirdos here?

** I'm a big proponent of the idea that JKR made things up as she wrote the series. She introduces new ideas and twists characters and their personalities /to fit the plot/ she writes. Her work, by far, isn't perfect. That's not to say it's not enjoyable, but it's got tons of wacky worldbuilding and much, much more.

If you said this on [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]], you would get downvoted to heck, because unlike fanfiction authors who re-interpret and write transformative takes on the series, the people there are way protective and defense of JKR and her works as some sort of sacred text. JKR's Twitter, Cursed Child, and the movies can be criticized at will, but the original books themselves are perfect, and they will think up elaborate headcanons to justify why no one ever checked up on Harry at the Dursleys during his childhood, why Dumbledore did nothing for 35 years after Tom Riddle left school and became Voldemort, why it took Dumbledore a year to share 30 minutes' worth of Pensieve memories, why the Deathly Hallows camping sequence even happened.

On the main sub, the people there will twist their minds into pretzels to retroactively justify character inconsistencies in the books. The handwave force is strong over there, with their reasoning. It's absolutely /bonkers./

- "Chill dude, it's a story for children."

- "It doesn't make sense, but that didn't stop you from loving the story at age 12."

- "The books were written from Harry's PoV, and he is not observant, and also limited in perspective and naturally biased".

- "The books didn't say it wasn't like this."

  - (In reference to Nagini being an Asian woman, and McGonagall a 120 old woman who took a 50 year sabbatical so she can appear in CoG and have taught for 39 years by OotP. The reaching after FB:CoG was crazy.)

As fanfic readers and writers, I think we can admit that JKR pulled author fiat. Not as many true plot holes as people think (and "Plot Hole" is used so often that it has lost all meaning these days) but inconsistencies of character, character motivation, and lack of characterization depth, all to serve the overarching plot.

But it's commonly used by members of the fanbase is to handwave plot inconsistencies, like why Harry never knew Luna or McLaggen existed before they were introduced in books 5 and 6, even though Luna was a friend and neighbor of Ginny, and McLaggen (a notorious attention seeker, braggart, and guy who ate a pound of doxy eggs) was in his house.

*** It could also be using different media lenses to analyse the film. approaches are Watsonian or Doylist [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lg13Kcw-w5Y][This video helps break down how you can use these two approaches to look at the books itself and in what contexts you might use them.]]

Fundamentally you are right in that the books could be written better, in which case you are using a Doylist approach to critique the book and look at its contents. But it is the wrong way to approach people making handcanons, who have accepted the book-as-is and are now then trying to build on the book by extrapolating and "filling in the blanks" Thus, "Harry didn't notice" is a reasonable answer to the question of why Luna didn't show up in the earlier books.

Like an easy headcanon that many other media would show and play for humor is to flashback to the past events. Give humorous reasons and coincidences to show two characters almost meeting, repeatedly before their first actual canon meeting.

Then ok, you broke down the plot inconsistencies of the books. You showed those ignorant fans that they've enjoyed the books wrong! You were right!

And now what? What next?

I mean by definition, [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]] is about a series where the last book came out 12 years ago, the last movie 7 years ago. Surely for a media series this popular and this influential, the readers you are trying to persuade might have already had a discussion about plot inconsistencies and other flaws in the writing. Anyone who still participates in that subreddit is still willing to show love for a series whose main canon was last expanded a generation ago Like if they know the book is not perfect and they still love the series enough to participate in that subreddit specifically, what can they do? They can't rewrite the series, they aren't going to drop the book series so ultimately headcanon is what they have left. In-canon explanations for inexplicable plot points, is so much more useful as a way to sustain discussion and love for the series. So of course they would handwave it away.

I think this is also the basis of fanfics. A fanfiction starts because of an idea or a concept that is not represented in canon. Sometimes it's a continuation of canon, sometimes a change, but it is always something that is beyond canon. Because people are interested in that they need to be critical or at least open-minded in regards to canon. A fanfic reader is also likely to be way more hardcore into the fandom than a non-fanfic reader.

On that other sub (which I personally don't use, but not for any particular reason) there are people coming from way more different backgrounds. Some only saw the movies, others only read the books. People on that sub will on average be less knowledgeable about the series and have spent way less time discovering the universe and pondering it.

In all seriousness, I never really bought Harry/Ginny in canon, until I read some really good fanfiction that made it believable for me. That's just one example of the power of fanfiction.

The discussion generally is more open, not just about canon. We had quite a few "headcanon" threads were the most popular headcanons shit all over canon and yet are the most popular replies. Hell, you can joke about Albus Severus being the result of Ginny cheating, and you get upvotes because people get that you are not very serious and just throwing some shade at Rowling. Which is also something we are very open for.

I think that the only things which get you instantly downvoted here are requests for serious underage (as in, 8 year olds getting raped and not a bunch of 5th years fooling around), rape in general and Death Eater pairings because most people simply find them unbelievable. But other than that, we are usually down for discussions, no matter if the simple "who is best girl" or the nuances of magical theory.

**** As someone who thinks that Bellatrix is a more viable option than Malfoy or Snape (although it still is a crackship), let me tell you that it is down to three factors. The "coolness" of Bellatrix, her combat ability and the fact that she spent over a decade in prison.

Now to add some depth:

1 We see that Snape holds a petty grudge and takes it out on an 11 year old boy. That is simply too pathetic to see past that IMO. Add that everything he does is due to an obsession with a girl he drove away and then not only tore down the bridge but dropped several nukes onto the area by joining the Death Eaters.

We know that Malfoy is all bark but no bite. He spends years boasting about his family and calls for racial purges by twelve, yet he cannot put his money where his mouth is. And while we see Bellatrix attack the actual opposition, Malfoy tries some stupid scheme which attacks civilians but has no chance of achieving its objectives.

Meanwhile, Bellatrix is cool evil, much like Vader. She is absolutely ruthless and a complete psychopath, but from what we have seen she makes a top notch enforcer. She is also the only actual threat other than Voldemort and fucking Umbridge. Which brings us to

2 Bellatrix is a capable fighter. She takes down Tonks and Sirius with nonlethal spells. She is capable of defeating some of the more capable Order Members without even going all out. She duelled three Order members to a standstill, simultaneously. Snape is certainly a good spy, but we never see him against a capable fighter. But he was defeated pretty easily in his worst memory, and given what we know about Bellatrix, I doubt that she would have gone down that easily. You can make her one of the most capable fighters without contradicting canon. And Malfoy is nowhere near either of them. Something which makes Bellatrix cool evil again.

3 Call me old fashioned, but IMO criminals have to be punished for their misdeeds. Not just rehabilitated, but actually punished. There can be no redemption without punishment. Therefore, at least in my opinion, Bellatrix is more redeemable than Snape or Malfoy. She didn't enjoy life in a manor or castle, she was tortured in an inhumane prison. She has faced consequences for her actions. Which makes me more inclined to give her a fresh start.

Lastly, disregarding time travel there is exactly one scenario in which I would consider Bellatrix a viable partner. She has to defect BEFORE the DoM battle. Not to Dumbledore, but to either Harry and by extension Hermione, or to Andromeda and later Harry. Thirteen years in hell on earth are certainly enough to justify a change of heart.

That being said, there is a scenario in which I would consider Draco as viable option. If he begins to question pureblood supremacy before and without calling Hermione Mudblood. He shouldn't immediately declare his undying love for the Beatles, but question during the second year, investigate during the third and slowly come around during the fourth or fifth. Also, just because he considers blood purity bullshit that does not mean that his opinion of the Weasleys would rise.

Sometimes yes, it's silly to put the books on pedestal like some people do, but often "breaking canon down" devolves into silly nitpicking, to be honest. Most of the "plotholes" aren't really plotholes, and even when they are... I don't see how having Flint repeat his year, for example, decreases the overall literary value of the books. And yes, sometimes the events are timed so that a dramatic reveal can happen when the plot demands it or some minor characters' personalities are exaggerated for satirical purposes, and there's nothing wrong with that. This is how fiction works. I don't expect 100% realism and pages upon pages of wordbuiding explaining every detail of the world from fantasy mystery coming-of-age stories, and they would be actively worse for having it. It's fun to speculate and fill in the blanks, but sometimes people here approach the books like CinemaSins youtube channel, only 100% serious.

** Because I think the people in this sub are looking for something different than people in [[/r/HP][r/HP]]. Many of us are adults and have somewhat outgrown canon Harry Potter because they're well children's books. This sub can provide a hub for mature discussion and also can be a good starting point for a new person entry into the fandom.

** Who said I liked this sub more?

Edit: fine, I do. You caught me. FanFiction is often better than cannon.

*** I'd say often probably isn't a good term considering that over 99% of the fanfiction in this community is absolute trash but there is a fair few I consider to be stronger than canon.

** I stay there because sometimes there's questions I can answer about Canon, and explanations people missed because they didn't really read the books.

** Well besides its own set of problems, I like this forum because it has lots of nice people and lots of cute usernames to read and also I have other reader friends from here like Achille and Grimmy and also Florea. :)

** Honestly they're both the same. The only difference being that from my experience, people on the other sub are less up their own asses about shit than on this sub. Not everyone on this sub, but a few people.

** I follow both, but tend to spend more time over here because fanfiction innately imparts more freedom to examine any disparate possibilities one could imagine.

If I go over there and ask, "What if Petunia had gone to Hogwarts with Lily and ended up with Sirius" I get the feeling the response would be much different than asking the same question here. (Though, as I'm not in the habit of starting discussions often, I would probably not do so either way.)
