Request/Prompt

I've read a few stories in which the fact that Harry's hair grew back was a result of him being a metamorphagus. Are there any stories in which changing your hair-length is instead a universal ability that all witches and wizards have? I mean, I don't remember anyone ever getting a haircut in Hogwarts. Considering how easy it is to impersonate you (poly juice) with just a few strands of hair, I'd imagine wizards guard their hair jealously.


** It's canon that regrowing your hair is normal, afaik. It's mentioned in Miranda Goshawk's /Book of Spells/. Harry was just showcasing some sickass accidental magic.
