Hobby was a perculiar house elf, for he always wanted to learn magic, He had an average house elf life, he did all the chores for his master, got treated like garbage and slept on the floor, he was tired, tired of always being stepped on, he wanted revenge, he wanted power, he wanted to CRUSH those wizards who have used him like a tool, he had a plan, he found a small young student ready for his first day of Hogwarts near the house, Hobby threw a rock at him making him unconscious, He stole all his belongings and wore his uniform which was obviously a bit baggy on him despite Hobby being big for an elf and the uniform being of the smallest size, He snuck into the crowd of first years getting ready for their first day, now with his stolen identity, ready for his first day of school (This is a prompt so you decide!)


** "*Martin Hobbs*?" McGonagall's voice called out.

It was the sorting ceremony for all first years at Hogwarts. The eleven-year-old boys and girls were chittering excitedly among themselves, and quite a handful were nervous about their new life at the wizarding school. Dressed in plain school robes, not yet categorized with their future house colors, the small children waited patiently for their turn. An even smaller child seemed particularly.../thrilled/, to be here.

Adjusting his robe to appear presentable, he squeezed his way through the throng of roadblockers, and sat upon the stool right in front of the Great Hall.

"*Good evening*," boomed the Sorting Hat, once placed on his head. "Good evening," he replied.

"*Now, what is it that you desire most in life?*"

He clenched his fists, fresh memories of being abused and mistreated from the years before resurfaced, and his emotions takes on the vengeful side of traits.

"I want to be respected. I want power over all." He said clearly, but quietly enough to not be heard by anyone other than the Hat.

"*Respect and power, eh? You seem to have an enormous thirst for magic, and it seems like you've done a few inexcusable things in attempt to achieve that.*"

A lump formed in his throat, but it was quickly gone as he reminded himself of the reason why he is here.

"*Very well, better be...SLYTHERIN!*"

One of the table rows at one side of the hall erupted in applause, delighted to have a new student join them at last.

A faint smirk formed on his face as he headed towards the green-robed group of students. A few handshakes were offered as well as several 'welcome's.

"Hello there, young Martin." The older student, with a badge boasting the words 'Prefect' on his robes, said to him.

"Hello, and if you please, call me Hobby. I'm not...quite used to be /Martin/." He replied, sitting down next to the older student, presumably a prefect.

Everything is going well, his disguise fooled everyone, and if not, most people. The transformation didn't add much to his height, but his elfish body was completely gone and in its place is a human boy's body. The boy that he had stolen his life from.
