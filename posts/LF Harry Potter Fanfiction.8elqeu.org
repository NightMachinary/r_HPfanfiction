Does anyone know of a Fanfiction where, Harry Potter's parents are alive, and he his the oldest, he has a brother who is WBWL and at least one young sister. He is in Slytherin, therefore he is ignored a little by his parents. NOT abused, just ignored. I have read it before, but cannot find it anywhere!

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
