I would like to read a story how Lily reacts to such a situation. I mean, apparently she knew that Snape called 'everybody of her birth' mudblood but her. He openly hangs out with the group of mini-death eater and to everybody else he is not someone just hanging out around them, but a part of that group in the sameway Avery and those other names mentioned.

How would those other muggleborns see Lily? As stupid and naive or even as a cooperator with enemy?

does anybody know stories that deal with this question?


** linkffn(Lily Bud).

It's not a proper story, but rather a series of one-shots regarding Lily's time at Hogwarts and her relations with everyone around her. It has quite a few issues, like grammar and spellings, and the way the author makes sudden jumps regarding Lily's relationship with Petunia, but makes for a decent read.

Edit: Unbelievable. FFbot is being ridiculous, this is the story I actually wanted to link. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12830160/1/Lily-Bud][Lily Bud]]. Also, it looks like you're the author of this story. Lol.

  Harry looks like Lily instead of James, the Dursleys aren't fat, Snape is nice, Dumbledore is evil... Future Drarry, Rated T just in case. Future Lemons! Weasley Bashing!

*** Yes, I am.

I wanted to see how other deal with this issue, because I was pretty upfront with it. I want to see how others handel or see this. Lily doesn't often gets called out for standing by a mini death eater that spreat bigot bullsh-. And if normally by the pureblood marauders, that just feels wrong.

**** I've read a fair number of Marauder era fics, and I've not seen any so far where Lily is called out for her double standards by muggleborns. There are a couple where James calls her out on it, but those were minor parts of the story.

Also, you should get a beta reader. The slow decline of Lily and Snape's friendship is decently done, but there are a number of trivial spelling and grammatical mistakes throughout your story.

***** Thank you for that. I try to keep the different relationships and friendships realistic and shift them slowly.

And yes I know I have to work on my grammar and spelling. I start writing ff to get a better feeling for the English language, but now I need to work on cleaning up my mistakes.

I tried to get a beta reader, but the story is too long for all that I asked so far.

Yeah, I didn't see many other stories like that either and I think it is a shame. Realisticly that should probably be part of Lily's story and development to deal with such views. I hoped others had stumbled over stories I just haven't found yet
