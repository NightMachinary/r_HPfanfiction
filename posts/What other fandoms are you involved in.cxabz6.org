Is Harry potter the only fandom you are involved in? If not what are your other fandoms? Are you more or less involved in those fandoms when you compare them to your involvement in the HP fandom?


** I'm into Fullmetal Alchemist!

** HP is actually the only fanfiction I read. Idk why, but I just can't find fanfics of other series interesting. I imagine it could be because I grew up reading Harry Potter and so many elements of the series have left me dissatisfied. So fanfiction allows me to continue reading material of this world whioe exploring different aspects and relationships in it that I prefer over canon. I just haven't had this desire for any other piece of media I enjoy.

Funnily enough, two of my favorite video games are the Dark Souos series and Bloodborne. Due to the vague nature of the stories, they're perfect candidates for exploring with fanfiction. I've considered reading some, but I haven't really wanted to get into it (to be fair it's hard for me to get into any kind of new media nowadays). It might just be because I enjoy the stories and lore of the originals so much that I'd rather play them or listen to somebody discussing the stories/lore than read a fanfic of it.

** RWBY.

I absolutely adore that show, with all its flaws and ups and downs. I love the characters, I love the fights, I love the world and after the (deserved) criticism Volume 5 received it was amazing what a huge turnaround Volume 6 was. Really excited for Volume 7!

** The fandom I'm most involved in other than HP is RWBY it has a lot of flaws but I like it a lot and the most recent volume was a huge improvement.

The RWBY fandom has shapped how I interact with other fandoms quite a bit. Shipping is really big in RWBY to the point where there is a spread sheet that lists the (multiple) creative ship names for every combination of characters. There are some truely ludicrous ships in that fandom. The absurd amount of exposure to and intrest in shipping in that fandom colored the way I consume content from other fandoms. Shipping became a bigger part of how I enjoy media and the over the top shipping in RWBY has made me more open to pairings I otherwise wouldn't consider. Also, if a fandom doesn't have a cute ship, I'm much less likely to get really into it and or read fanfiction for it.

I generally don't read that much fan fiction from other fandoms though mostly because this subreddit makes it a lot easier to find fics I might want to read and other fandoms don't seem to have an equivelent resource. But also I tend to have fewer options in other fandoms since they aren't nearly as large as HP and I tend to perfer rare pairs so there's just less to read.

So I read a lot more HP fanfiction but in RWBY in particular and other fandoms in general I seek out a lot more fan art.

So long story short I'm involved in other fandoms but I read mostly read HP fanfiction.

** I like pretty much one Pokemon fanfic and one Recess fanfic. But I have never even read other fanfics outside of HP. Funnily enough I wouldnt say I am a HP fan anymore, but the fanfic scene is super nice.
