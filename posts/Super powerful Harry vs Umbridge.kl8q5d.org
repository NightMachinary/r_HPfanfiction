Are there any hopped up Harrys that don't take any of Umbridge's shit?


** Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Na I kid. I am interested in that too. Seems like lots of people start powerful Harry after book 3 and starting in book 4.

** All her bluster and bigotry just washes off him in linkffn(Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay). It helps that the political landscape is quite different.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?
