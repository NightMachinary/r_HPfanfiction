Dumbledore is the type of Dumbledore seen in Dumbledore bashing fics, but Harry refuses to admit it. Instead of Harry being all Lord Hadrian Potter Black and DumblesBashing, he denies all claims and sticks by his side. Preferably not from Harry's POV, but from the POV of someone just facepalming at the obviousness on the side.


** "Professor Dumbledore why are we killing all these innocent orphans?"

"Well you see my boy, Tom too was just an innocent orphan. We are stopping a future Dark Lord, it is all for the Greater Good." As the eyes of Albus Percival Wulfuric Brian twinkles away.

"I see sir, for the Greater Good." As the boy, nay, young man raised his wand to the youngling filled building.

** "Hey, even if he is hypothetically evil, he's setting me up with a hot witch with a great family, is giving me influence to root out the evil shit in our government and society, is giving me a ton of galleons in the future at the expense of what my family has now, and is pushing me as his successor in a golden age where blood-purity means as much as Dudley's grades do."

Tonks opened her mouth to retort, paused, thought for a moment, then shut her mouth with an audible click. "Okay, I can't argue with that." She brightened considerably. "Lunch?"

He chuckled as he hooked his arm with her own, and purposefully ignored the stares as he escorted this 'Hot Witch' to the Leaky Cauldron.

/Well, he's cute enough, and Mum has been nagging me to settle down. If Dumbledore's 'evil' like Ginny said, he's my kind of evil./
