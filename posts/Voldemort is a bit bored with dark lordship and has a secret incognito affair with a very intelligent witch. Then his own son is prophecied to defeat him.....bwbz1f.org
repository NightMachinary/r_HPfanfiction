11 years later when he's trying to get the Philosopher's Stone:

"Voldemort... I'll never join you, you killed my parents!"

"Harry, I didn't want to kill your mother, but she left me no other choice!"

"And you just killed my father without even thinking about it?"

"No, I am your father!"

"No. No. That's not true. That's impossible!"

"Harry. Join me, and together we can rule the world as father and son. Give me the Stone."


** "You killed my parents!"

"Don't take that tone with me! And when was the last time you brushed your teeth? I'm going to the bathroom, and you'd better /hope/ I'm wrong, because if your toothbrush is dry, I will Imperius you until your teeth are /sparkling!"/

"B-but you killed my mum!"

"And you have poor dental hygiene! One of these things will deeply affect your future and the other one doesn't matter. As to which is which, I'll give you a hint: nobody likes bad breath."

*** I'm generally not a fan of Voldemort/Lily, but I would read this. Especially if Hermione starts to think that Voldemort isn't all that bad, cause c'mon proper dental hygiene.

  Thestrals can go a lot more places than just wherever you need to go. Unfortunately for Harry Potter, Voldemort is more than aware of this, and doesn't want to deal with Harry Potter anymore.
