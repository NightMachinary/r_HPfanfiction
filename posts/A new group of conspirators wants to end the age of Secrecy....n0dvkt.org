Not because they want to start a war or anything, but because they figured out a method to produce potions in enormous quantities and want to use it to provide magical cures to muggles, and make a ton of money.


** A compromise where secrecy remains but potions are still used for curing muggles isn't possible?

*** Probably not. I doubt even Hermione's Ministry would allow that, though it's debatable. Hermione might feel a sense of wanting to help the Muggles out there (especially in times of COVID), but then she'll probably realise that there's always the risk of the potions being analysed by scientists.

At some point, things might not add up in the lab, which would cause further investigation over time. These 'miracle cures' could very well end up being far more trouble to the Ministry than they're worth. It would be a nightmare to cover up their tracks in order to allow the potions to pass all the Muggle reviews and regulations out there.

Head Auror Harry would have his hands full trying to investigate and apprehend these conspirators.

If you asked me, I'd guess that some wizards (particularly Muggle-Borns) might discreetly issue the tonic to protect their own Muggle families and close Muggle-friends (probably without the latter's knowledge), and that's it. Strangers would be left out in the cold with regards to getting potions.

**** You underestimate the cunning of the Granger administration:

First, they released a children's series called Harry Potter, in which they glorified themselves and bashed their enemies into oblivion. Now that millions know about Harry Potter and that many Muggles like to flash Wands in the public, true Wizards have become a lot safer among them. Even if they occasionally cast some spells, Muggles won't take them for real! Furthermore, they made billions off those gullible Muggles.

As for how those billions could be deployed, they can exchange them into Galleons at reasonably favorable rate. They can buy real physical gold (and other precious metals). But most importantly, they can make strategic investments to further ensure the long term survival of the Magical Species.

For example, the end of the Cold War forced Muggle governments to downsize their militaries and sell off old military bases at bargain prices. They can acquire those valuable real estate cheaply and turn them into Wizard only enclaves. These are often very defendable sites with great existing infrastructure. Even better, cordoning these sites off from Muggles will not arouse a lot of suspicions.

To counter Muggles' rapid technological advances that could present a real threat to the SoS, the new British Ministry of Magic is preparing to come out into open, on their own terms. The release of the HP Series was merely a first step to test Muggles' reaction to the concept of magic. Needless to say, the results vastly exceeded their most optimistic expectations.

Their next step will be to further expand their presence in the Muggle world. They will partner with biotech and pharmaceutical companies to release lifesaving drugs. They will partner with visionary Muggle entrepreneurs to develop something really cool, such as a colony on Mars. They will go after their Muggle enemies in the media, and will try to turn their children against them. Through all this, they will apply their magic as a key competitive advantage.

When they eventually come out, the Muggle world should see them as a benevolent force and be highly dependent on. Of course, they will also hedge their bets:

- Their space program could provide them with an extraterrestrial refuge should their ‘coming out effort' fail.
- Their secret enclaves could provide them with additional safety.

Hmm that is a good point once they have a safe base established whats to stop them creating a port key or some kind of magical portal to Mars and back.

I'm guessing apperating is out of the question as the distance is too great.

Either way I really want Harry Potter in space now ahaha...so thanks for that!

** They don't have to end the Statute of Secrecy, just found many Muggle biotech companies and have them invent new 'technologies' with fancy terms, such as mRNA.

Then they need to use memory charms on some key people to pass scientific review and regulatory processes.
