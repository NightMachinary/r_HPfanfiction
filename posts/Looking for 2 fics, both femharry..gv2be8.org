:END:
I could have sworn I had these bookmarked but I cannot find them. If you can think of them or any similar it would be awesome thank you.

The first one is Harry is adopted by the Malfoys before Hogwarts but the story itself takes place in the final years. Voldemort is back and the Malfoys are good but I think either spying on him or just can't fully defect. Harry is named something like Iris but hides with the Malfoys as a cousin named Stella I believe. Voldemort forces Harry as Stella to marry Snape as a sort of punishment for the Malfoys and reward for Snape. They do eventually love each other and defeat him but have to keep up with the Stella Malfoy charade.

In the second Harry comes into a sort of accidental animagus transformation turned creature inheritance. I think the creature is called an anubis. Snape finds Harry, in this fic named Flora, and takes her to Voldemort presuming she is just a magical dog and a good replacement familiar since Nagini is gone for some reason I can't recall. Anubis feed off magical energy or something.

Any help finding these would be appreciated thanks!
