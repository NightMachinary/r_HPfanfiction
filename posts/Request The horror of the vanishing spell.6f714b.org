Does anyone know of a fic where someone is suitably horrified that they're expected to progress to eventually vanishing a kitten to non-being in Transfiguration class? I know I would have taken a T in that class that day, maybe even a detention. I'd also be okay with someone at least questioning it and getting a detention or something.

Why would you ever need to vanish a living thing anyways? Even If you were attacked by a bear you could just stun it. Seems unlikely you could vanish a dragon or something under duress anyways.


** I believe some of White Squirrel's stories have a bit of that, but clarify that the vanished beings were conjured or transfigured to begin with, and thus never really alive at all. I could be wrong, though.

** Recall that vanished things can be returned cf Montague was vanished and it took weeks to get him back.

*** Montague was pushed into the broken vanishing cabinet that Draco eventually repaired. It's not the same as Evanesco the vanishing spell.

**** Its mechanism is still vanishing and (re)conjuring. We see characters use vanishing and reconjuring an object as transportation several times. Two examples are Dumbledore reconjuring some vanished Madam Rosmerta's mead for Harry in HBP and Bill vanishing a load of Order documents to prevent Harry from seeing them in OotP.

There's also presumably a reason why the vanishing cabinets are named as they are and not called apparition cabinets or something else. Spells in HP are extremely flexible in the way they are applied. The coincidence in name and function would imply that the vanishing cabinets are a more advanced application of the Evanesco spell.

For a theoretical standpoint all the above makes sense. McGonagall introduces vanishing in OotP as the opposite of conjuring, and in DH we are told that vanishing sends objects into non-being. If conjuration is the opposite of vanishing then by the above two facts, conjuration is bringing objects out of non-being. So if you've vanished an object, it should be recoverable by conjuration. And since the object is in "non-being", which does not have a location, then it makes sense that you can reconjure vanished objects from any location, thus using it as a transportation tool.

*** They thought it was a vanishing cabinet but it turned out to be a transportation one that was broken so I don't know if that counts?

** This fic has someone horrified by a vanishing spell fairly early on but otherwise doesn't match your criteria at all. But no-one's recommended anything else yet so linkffn(Have Chrome, Will Travel).
