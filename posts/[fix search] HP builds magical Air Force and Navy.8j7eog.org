Hello I am looking for a long fic I read some time ago. In said fic Harry and friends move to a new island (I think it was an island) where they start building planes, ships, and I think there was were a sub. At some point the town get nuked and they are fighting against The Order, British MoM, and I think there was the American MoM too. Might have been something about a Magical space station too. Hoping to read this one again soon!


** linkffn(brutal Harry)

I'm also just guessing.

#+begin_quote
  Systematically abused and degraded children do not suddenly turn into well-adjusted members of society when removed from the abusive situation. Nor do they tend to be very trusting of others, or forgiving. Sequel up.

  As Magical England grinds itself through civil war and Magical Europe at large collapses in upon itself, Harry hunts through it all. Dumbledore has disappeared, Lucius Malfoy has publically fallen out with Fudge, and most the population of Hogwarts has fled to America, bringing many families of Muggleborns with them. Sequel to Brutal Harry. Rated for violence/messiness.

****** Hey, FanfictionBot, just a quick heads-up:\\
*publically* is actually spelled *publicly*. You can remember it by *ends with --cly*.\\
Have a nice day!

** Hmmm no those are not the one I am looking for but both are good reads too. I was thinking that the story I was looking for is kinda like linkffn(7135971) in the fact that main charatures are designing/building super advanced "magical tech" when trying to build a new better society.
