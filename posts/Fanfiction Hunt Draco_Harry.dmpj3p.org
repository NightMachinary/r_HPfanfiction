Hi everyone,

I am looking for a draco/harry fanfic. They have magical tattoos and Harry defends Draco after HP&HBP and then Draco goes to Durmstrang. The pair restore Godric's Hollow opposed to going to school for seventh year.

I believe this post may have been looking for it as well: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8thcr3/looking_for_a_drarry_fic/]]

Any ideas?
