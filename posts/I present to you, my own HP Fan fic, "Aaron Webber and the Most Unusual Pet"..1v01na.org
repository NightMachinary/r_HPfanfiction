I have created a character who attends Hogwarts the same time as Harry. His events don't really parallel Harry's in any way. I've always been interested in what it was like for other students who went through the same events. I'm not sure if I should continue with this story series, so I'd like your feedback on it.

- Title - Aaron Webber and the Most Unusual Pet
