*** I believe canon Ginny never did lose her crush/love for Harry, she just tried to convince herself otherwise. What OP is asking for is probably something like Ginny stopped caring for Harry romantically at all and Harry goes to comical lengths to win her back, perhaps like copying her valentine's poem from CoS or something.

**** Realistically, I lose crushes I've had after like 6 months. I'm still attracted to them, but I think most crushes dissipate within a year or so.

Not saying that's what happened in canon (we don't see enough of Ginny imo to see is she's gotten over Harry or not) but it would be realistic imo.

***** What I think happened was the crush intensified after CoS due to hero worship, then she let it go around GoF cause of Hermione's advice, then she really, truly fell in love as all 15 year olds do in HBP, sort of how I read it.
