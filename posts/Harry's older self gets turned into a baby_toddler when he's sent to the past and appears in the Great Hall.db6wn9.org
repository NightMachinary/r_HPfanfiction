I think this was a Master of Death fanfic where Harry gets sent by Death to the past during Marauder's era and he appears in the Great Hall I think by Lucius. He's turned into a toddler (2 or 3 yrs old) and he's been abused by the Dursley's. He plays up his innocence (being from the future) but can't quite hide the signs of abuse (flinching, etc..) done by the Dursley's. He's retained all his memories of his older- self and I think he mentions that he was deaged by 15 yrs.

Lucius Malfoy and Lily Evans take an active role in caring for him so he switches from Gryffindor and Slytherin Houses. Malfoy is quite offended by the fact that he's been abused and both him and Lily go to Gringotts either to get him financially secure which Malfoy offers to do or to see who his parents are and get him adopted. Dumbledore seems quite happy to let them jointly care for him and Malfoy sees that Lily isn't quite bad. It is not a Lucius and Lily pairing. It is Harry-centric.

I think it was on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]], but I'm not sure. That's all I remember, so any thoughts?
