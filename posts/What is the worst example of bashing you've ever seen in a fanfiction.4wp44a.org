For me it's this linkffn(6445945)


** I never really understood the concept of bashing. I get what it is, I just don't get why. There are a few characters that I don't particularly like, but I find it hard to just write a story just to tear them down. Bashing just sounds like bad writing to make up for not being able to make a character villainous enough to be hateworthy. If that makes any sense...

*** I don't get the appeal either. I naturally root for underdogs, so the "this innocuous/realistically villainous person is now /extra evil/ for no reason and karma will make them suffer for it ad nauseam" kind of bashing always backfires for me. It feels like a helpless puppet being punished for having a bad puppeteer, and the bad characterization gets me thinking about how the character really thinks and acts, which makes me relate to them. Hell, bashing might even make me sympathize with a monster like Umbridge.

** linkffn(The Champion's Champion)

This entire stories purpose is bashing.

Funnily enough its from the same author. Driftwood1965 seems to have some unresolved issues with a few characters.

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.

** My story sorta hits on bashing/ 'alternating opinions' of certain characters (Mostly alternating opinions). But I'll just say, there's making characters villainous, and then there's throwing in a two liner of character X trying and failing to do something once or twice per chapter. More often than not when I see that a story is marked as bashing it is the latter style that comes into play. That being said, I don't know it either. I never really saw Dumbledore as this Machevilian type until I came across several stories with it, and then I thought: "Not, that impossible. I mean, he withheld information from people during this entire story. And he had a hand in almost everything." That said, the Ron/Weasley hate is a bit of a different story. I have no legitimate reasoning there.
