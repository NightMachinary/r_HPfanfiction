Can I get some HP fic recs in which Harry has red hair and looks like Lily? Obviously, it shouldn't just be a rewrite of canon, I would prefer if they were changes.. Time travel, Dimension travel and crossovers also accepted. Harry can be male or female, I don't mind either


** Red-hair, hand me down clothes and you look like you've never seen a galleon before. You must be a Weasley

A what?

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

**** Do you prefer male harry with more physical characteristics leaning towards lily? Or do you want a genderbent fic where harry was born a girl, and looks like lily? If your looking for the former, I don't know of any, but if your interested in the latter, I have a great series on my reading list for you

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

  Curiosity killed the cat, satisfaction brought it back. Harry's curiosity leads him to exploring the Chamber a bit more thoroughly before he leaves for the Summer. What he finds there gives him a new responsibility beyond just himself and a lifelong satisfaction in the choices he makes from there on.

  Vernon gets the smarts when accidental magic in response to a bellow breaks the compulsion to be mean to Harry. He is well sore with the magical world which is making a child soldier by grooming Harry, so he decides to turn the weapon back on them by teaching Harry all he needs to survive.

  in a burst of accidental magic, Harry uses legilimensy to see pictures of his mother, and wish magic turns him into a little girl who looks like Lily. Vernon dies, and Petunia looks for somewhere to move. In Crawley they meet a little girl who also has accidental magic and with Petunia's knowledge and Dan Granger's cunning, plots are made. Fem! Harry, an experiment for me.

** Can't remember the name at the moment, but I read one where Harry has red hair, is a pastel goth, and gay. Plus draco has a crush on him. It's cute, heartwarming, inspiring and decently long. There's a good amount of world building, too. I'll be sure to add its name but you could probably find with enough searching.
