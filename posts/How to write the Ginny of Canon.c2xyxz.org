** Canon Ginny is:

- Aggressive: would physically beat up/magically assault someone just for annoying her. Zach Smith found it out the hard way twice.
- Brave: faced off some of the worst sadistic mass murderers in Magical Britain at age of 14, didn't hesitate to go back fighting again and again.
- Devoted: unlike Hermione who has her own agenda, she seems unconditionally loyal toward Harry, whether it was to get him into Umbridge's office, defend him against Hermione with respect to the Half-Prince Book, accept his decision to break up with her, or try to steal the Gryffindor Sword for him.
- Emotionally strong: She overcame the massive trauma suffered in her first year and the crush on her hero, and grew up to become a popular jock in the school by her 4th year. Unfortunately, the Books are mostly from Harry's POV and we don't see how she made this change. The biggest fandom attack against Ginny the character is that most of her development happens off screen. She also never cries which is a major reason why Harry likes her.
- Intelligent: Of course not as smart as Hermione, but clever enough to sneak them into Umbridge's office. Later in Year 7, she and Neville organized the student rebellion at Hogwarts, without really getting caught.
- Jealous: During the Wedding, she got upset when Gabrielle was hero worshipping Harry. Later in the Room of Requirement, she bluntly denied Cho to accompany Harry in searching for the Diadem.
- Mean: When she doesn't like someone, such as Fleur and Zach Smith, she can be exceedingly nasty. When she gets upset, she can be quite cruel, as her verbal thrashing of Ron showed. That was one of the worst insults of the entire series.
- Powerful: Again, lots of telling but no showing in the Books. We get to see a few times when she knocked out others with her Bat Bogey Hex, but that's basically it. She survived the Final Battle without injuries, I see that as a combination of skills and luck.
- Pretty: Don't get fooled by Emma Watson, Ginny is depicted as a lot more attractive (at least for Harry) than Hermione in the Books.
- Protective: She will go great length standing up and taking care for her friends. Luna is one. Later during the Final Battle, Harry saw her comforting and helping an injured student on his way to the Forbidden Forest.

Canon Ginny is not:

- A slut: If you think having two boyfriends in two years makes one a slut, then it's YOU who are having an issue. For those who think she only used the two boys, it was Hermione's suggestion to begin with. If you want shit on her because of that, at least shit on Hermione at same time. I don't like double standards.
- Lily Evans lookalike: This is in my opinion a huge misconception in the fandom. There is not a single piece of evidence in the Books saying they have physical similarities, even the shades of their red hairs are different. This misconception seems to mostly come from readers in places where red heads are rare. But in Britain, up to 10% of the population can have red hairs. Personality wise, Ginny has far more in common with James than Lily, as both are definitely not sticklers for rules.

Honestly, Books 5 and 6 have done enough for her characterizations. You just need to pay a little attention to excerpts involving her.

*** Agreed on all of this.

One thing I would add is that while she is Devoted to Harry, she can and will stand up to him and call him out when needed... whether about not asking her about his possession worries at Christmas in OOTP, his shouting at them after the Sirius vision, and even with the HBP book where she's skeptical until Harry proves it's /just/ a book with notes in it.

Also, I'm not sure the right word for it but when offered the chance to go to the Yule Ball with Harry she turns it down since she already said yes to Neville. If she were as "must marry Harry" crazed as some claim there's no way she'd do that.

** Mention her a couple of times per book perhaps and then at the end of your fan trilogy have her and Harry hook up because she is an incredible person and totally developed into an "interesting" character and unique and then on the prologue they are married.

*** You got downvoted for pointing out the truth. People here can be in denial all they want. Yeah, she's in the books more than the movies, but she came out of no where in regards to hooking up with Harry. One second Harry doesn't care, the next he has a 'monster in his chest' when he sees Ginny with someone else.

They barely interact, and then, BOOM.

**** We don't see them interact, and JKR definitely has an issue with show vs tell, but Harry does mention that he and Ginny spent a lot of their summer together. On the train when she says "I'm going top see Dean" or whatever he gets annoyed. There's also a mention of a flowery smell from the Burrow before "the monster" scene

**** Yup, there is in fact a reason why the fandom thought Ginny might have been slipping Harry love potions (and thus spawned many many truely awful fics). Harry's attraction to her comes completely out of left field.

***** This never makes sense to me as a criticism, because my first boyfriend was someone I snogged randomly at a party and then dated for two years. I was 16 at the time. It's quite normal for teenagers to just suddenly fancy someone.

** I'm sorry I'm late. I went back to my [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/c01jqp/tired_of_ron_bashing_lets_discuss_what_ron/er3miye/?context=3][Ron comment]] to get a rough outline for Ginny.

- Likes/dislikes

Ginny likes

Ginny loves flying--and she notably likes Chasing the best. Seeking gets the glory, but Chasing is the most active role in the game. Ginny likes doing things and she likes doing it as a team.

Ginny does not like being put down. She's the youngest of the family and it's implied she's often babied.

Ginny grew up to resent this, and part of her more pro-active stances are likely a continuation of this.

- Strengths

Ginny is absolutely devoted to her friends. She won't let them diminish themselves.

When Neville Longbottom tries to pass himself off as "nobody," Ginny is quick to counter this.

Ginny has a maternal streak to her, even if it's not particularly pronounced.

She's kind to Neville.

She's protective of Luna.

- Weaknesses

For all her desire to not be seen as a little girl, Ginny does have a bratty streak to her.

She comes up with an immature nickname for Fleur--Phlegm. However snobby Fleur is (and she is indeed a snob), "Phlegm" crosses a line.

She throws a tantrum when Molly tells her she cannot stay up to listen to the Order's meeting.

She's small--If you were ever to write a fight scene, however powerful with jinxes Ginny is, if her opponent is able to close the distance and it becomes hand-to-hand, Ginny's doomed.

- Biggest Misconceptions

As eloquently put by [[/u/InquistorCOC][u/InquistorCOC]], Ginny is not a slut.

She dates two boys, Michael and Dean, in the span of approximately two years, with a considerable gap between her break-up with Dean and when she starts going out with Harry.

Furthermore, let us examine Ginny's outrage when Ron "tries" to warn her about the risks to her reputation. Ginny is furious, insulting Ron cruelly, but she also is noted to be "near tears." Ginny is noted as rarely being weepy. So we can conclude that she's deeply hurt by the insinuation.

Ginny also does not resemble Lily Evans. Ginny is routinely described as having typical Weasley flaming red hair. Lily had dark red hair. Ginny's eyes are bright brown, exactly like her mother's. Lily had striking green eyes. Ginny is described as small--even as late as /Half-Blood Prince,/ strangers call her "a little girl." We're never given a real description of Lily's height--though we can at least judge that she isn't notably short.

- Other insights

Ginny has an inclination towards older names. She named Ron's owl "Pigwidgeon." She named her Pygmy Puff "Arnold."

Make of it what you will, but those were old names even in the 1990s.

Examine Ginny's friendship with Luna Lovegood.

When first introduced, Ginny calls her "Loony," but makes a note of calling her "Luna" to her face.

She muffles her laughter--though whether she's laughing at Luna or laughing at Neville and Harry's reactions to Luna is an open question. Possibly a bit of both.

Ginny snarls at Luna for insulting Hagrid.

But we later see them in each other's company outside of classes and Luna later says that Ginny defends her from bullies.

** I really like how Ginny is fleshed out in Nightmares of Futures Past, but unfortunately FFN took it down due to spurious copyright claims. You can still find most of it on various sites, and the ebook has up to chapter 43.

Ginny is a main character from the start, plus a lot of the story happens at the Burrow. Opinions are mixed on the ethics of their friendship, since Harry has traveled back in time, merged with his younger self, and is thus arguably much older, but the characterisation of Ginny is spot on IMO.

** It depends on what you really think about her. I really like her, even though she is written very poorly in canon (I think, she is probably the worst written main character in all of JKR books), so any good fanfiction has to make a lot of work to finish bad job left behind JKR. I really like stories by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Northumbrian/pseuds/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]] (also on [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewuser.php?uid=13604][SIYE]]), who did in my opinion magnificent job in filling her story. There are some other:

- linkao3(Inner Demons by serendipity_50) was one of the first fanfiction stories I have read, and I still hold it as my alternative headcanon (with the Northumbrian's one as the main one).
- recently I have discovered linkffn(Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince by RRFang), which is what I was talking about: fixing horrible job left behind by JKR in the Half-Blood Prince.
- for AU Slytherin Ginny, which is however very positive for her, read linkffn(The Changeling by Annerb) (there are also sequels linkffn(12713008) and linkffn(13143812), but I am not sure about those, they seem to be rather drawn for too long).

  Long-distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances, but Harry and Ginny don't have the luxury of living normal lives. Their relationship is put to the test when Ginny returns to school and Harry stays behind to continue his Auror training. Ginny soon realizes her greatest challenge may be in coming to terms with Harry's fame and dangerous line of work and deciding if she can make the sacrifices needed to be part of his life. Sequel to Starting Over. (COMPLETE)
