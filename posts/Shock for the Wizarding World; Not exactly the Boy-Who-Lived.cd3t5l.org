I'm hoping for a fic where Manipulative!Dumbledore told the WW about the “Boy-Who-Lived”; but Harry shows up at Hogwarts as the “Girl-Who-Lived”. Never was a boy. Lily's daughter the spitting image of her, with a flower name- as seems to run in the family. Petunia having kicked Vernon to the curb and moving away from Number 4 Privet Dr. Petunia going to the Goblins right after her divorce to start working things out with the accounts. Maybe Petunia has a small amount of magic, like more than a Squib but less than a witch? Maybe finding out what happened to Sirius, reading Wills, and siccing Madame Bones on them. Somewhat cautious female!Harry. One who has been taught the strengths of women, that there will still be those who look down on you, and or try to use you. Who loves to learn anything practical, and helpful, who is always watchful after learning of her ‘fame'; who ends up ANYWHERE but Gryffindor. And maybe even after finding out about the lies printed about her, makes them redact them, repay; money she uses to have someone write the truth as she knows it so far. Perhaps have the money put aside for children who come from abusive homes, or don't have one, or just need money for new supplies? Things I'd really like, but don't have to have: Whether James was her father or he couldn't have kids so blood adopted her and she now has some third mystery parent somewhere- most likely dead, is up to author. She could go by ‘flower name' Evans then.

Sorry I know this is a super long prompt, I've just been looking EVERYWHERE for something like this. And I'm not good with writing or I'd do it my self; I'm only good with the helping, the ideas, and the editing. If anyone ever wants to write a long fic, starting a bit before Hogwarts and stuff, with this idea I'd be willing to help. Otherwise just the general gist?

**** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18572623/chapters/44025565][here it is!]] it's on a bit of a semi-hiatus now due to Real Life, so fair warning.

*** Sounds good! Any fics that are along the lines of Boy-Who-Lived being the Girl-Who-Lived, or the opposite are more than welcome! I'm hoping to get at least a few; considering it looks like I'm not the only one interested in this concept.

*** Okay. I'm not sure why, exactly you're commenting. To insult or nitpick some random prompt, that you don't seem to be interested in anyway? Seems like a bit of a waste of time, but hey, it's your life and time to waste.
