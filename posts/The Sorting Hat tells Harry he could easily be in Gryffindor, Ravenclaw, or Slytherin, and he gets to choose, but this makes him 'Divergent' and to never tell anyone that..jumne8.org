Impossible. A Harry Potter who doesn't utter the words "Sorting hat wanted to put me in Slytherin" at least once is a myth. It simply doesn't exist.

**** Not necessarily trolling. Perhaps, a good way to deduce what house someone truly belongs in.

You tell them that they are special. Important. That they have a great destiny, and that whatever path they take, they will not fail. That they have genuine agency, and that considerations of what their family or similar might think are dwarfed by the ultimate impact of their choice.

Then, you ask them to choose a path.

Mind you, you then get a bunch of 11-year-olds with severely inflated egos, but you can't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs.

***** The books are far better than the movies. The first two books are interesting enough, in terms of YA dystopias they are ok to good. The third book is more like someone planned out a quintet and then wrote the last three books of it into one slim volume. On top of that the third book also has an asspull "good" triumphs over "evil" saccharine ending which betrays almost every single tentative theme the series had. So overall I was having an alright time in the first two and then the ending of the third bombed harder than mass effect 3.
