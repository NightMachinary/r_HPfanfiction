Hi I'm looking for any Snape x OFC stories. Preferably finished and preferably where the OFC is a student and of age. I'm reading Voluptas Noctis Aeternae, In Fields of Purple Amaranth, and some of the short ones on AO3. I'd prefer if they were long, but any kind of recommendation is appreciated!

I've read a lot of SSHG books, so I'd prefer if it is an original female character rather than a Harry Potter character! :)

Thank you!


** There's an HHr story called [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9552519/1/Reboot][Reboot]] that has Snap with an OC. There relationship isn't the focus but it's a good story.

In a post Wizarding War world families are torn to shreds and in the middle of piecing themselves back together the Black Family, notoriously wicked for generations, is the target of Minister Fudge's wrath for a scapegoat to make it all go away. Only what he never expected was the uproar the youngest assumed dead member of the clan would unleash on him to ensure he rights all he has done against her family. Though soon enough she learns Fudge is only the tip of the iceberg, much bigger wicked fish are circling in those waters waiting for her to slip.

It's not romantic between the two but Snape helps my main oc and guides her through the process of both fighting and infiltrating the DE and supporting her afterwards while sh is given full charge of those remaining alive and free after Voldy is dead. Him and Barty Crouch Jr alongside Minerva spend a great deal of time mentoring and protecting her while she's a student and later when she's all but forced to become a professor herself at Hogwarts.
