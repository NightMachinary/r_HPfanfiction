How can I show the difference between "one of the greats" and "the greatest"?


** Depends on what you mean by 'Greatest Wielder of Magic'. Like, is he the best in every way? Or is he just the most powerful or most knowledgeable or most skilled?

If he's the most powerful, you make lots of notes about how Voldemort's magic effects the surrounding environment and has lots of 'This is Powerful Shit' type particle effects on it. Maybe his lightning spells cause ambient storms or his death magic kills nearby plant matter, etc.

Most knowledgeable, just give him weird curses and things to know.

If he's most skilled, emphasis his movements and dexterity. Think of how you might describe a really talented dancer or martial artist and follow those kinds of themes of description.

In terms of balancing out Dumbledore, the easiest way is probably don't compare him to Voldemort. Compare him to the other people going up against Voldemort. If the aurors get mowed down, Dumbledore can hold his own in ways that emphasise that he's barely holding on and only managing that because he's really good (eg. Voldemort takes down Dumbledore's shield in a single spell, but Dumbledore animates some transfigured crap to dance in front of the next curse to give him time to put up another shield).

It's generally pretty hard to make two Titans-of-a-Field-type characters 'balance' out like that (once two characters are geniuses, there's not much to distinguish them on), which is why a lot of stories starring OP characters experience significant difficulty. If every character is superman, then it's hard to make any character Superman, y'know? Comes off as very "Our protagonist, Random Schoolkid A, is the greatest genius of our time, and here we see him going up against Random Schoolkid B, the other greatest genius of our time." and such.

** Have dumbledore be on the defensive the entire time, after a scene where Voldemort absolutely /destroys/ everyone else. Like, vaporisation before they get their wands up, melding them into walls, huge waves of fire or bolts of lightning, killing curses like from a chaingun. Seasoned aurors destroyed in under a second, etc.

And then, bring out Dumbledore. He doesn't go par to par, not even close - but he's a significant step above the best auror in the force. He is on the defensive the entire time, taking a step back for every step Voldemort takes forward, but he /is/ defending himself and others, throwing up strange shield after strange shield, never quite getting the chance to actually attack, but also not letting Voldemort destroy him and those he protects.

*** I would suggest showing Dumbledore getting in 1-2 offensive hits of his own which Voldemort manages to shrug off quite easily while congratulating Dumbledore for his shots. This would show that Dumbledore did what nobody else could, thereby establishing his position as "One of the greats" but also establishing Voldemort as "THE Greatest".

** Give more power and control to his spells. e.g. An animation moving more fluidly, V's side of the fight looking somewhat more artistic and/or vicious than Dumbledore's. Give a stilted and rushed feel to Dumbledore's side, perhaps a bead of sweat to contrast a twitch of V's lips into a brief grin.

A lot of people instantly jump to Killing Curses and Fiendfyre to show V's superiour skill and power since they're commonly known to need a lot of power and/or control, but it often leaves the fight feeling lackluster and V feeling deranged/singe-minded.

Putting titan-esque Dumbledore on the back-foot should be shown as a feat, rather than an overload of 'unblockable' spells. There was a fight in The Black Queen's (I-forget-which-book) that showed an imbalance between the MC and Voldemort while still showing off the power behind each quite well(attack on Hogsmeade where Tonks showed up to intervene and showed her own profound skill if anyone else remembers?).

All said, I'd suggest a bit of wariness on Voldemort's part, given the Legend that is Dumbledore. It can serve well to show that he's maybe holding back in fear of Dumbledore underplaying his own hand and needs to be ready to counter an unknown.

** I think the best way is to clearly show how both of them are (at least) a league above everyone else.

In Canon during the Battle of the DoM, the 1st reactions of the Death Eater to Dumbledore arrival was to try to flee. They didn't even try to put a fight, because they knew they stood no chance. You could try to create a similar situation to show the difference of strenght.

Maybe Dumbledore effortlessly defeated most of Voldemort Inner Circle before failling during their duel. Or maybe Voldemort managed to destroy a team composed of elite wizards, created to kill him, in mere seconds before Dumbledore arrived and managed to hold him off several minutes for the survivors to escape.

It's ok for Dumbledore to lose against Voldemort, as long as it is made clear that he could still fight most of Magical Britain alone, and win.

** I was always under the impression that Voldemort was a powerhouse. Dumbledore's image as a magical titan is due to the sheer breadth of his knowledge and most of it being esoteric. V could throw out AKs like they were candy but Dumbledore could block it 15 ways with out breaking a sweat...

** If you've ever watched the Hobbit movies, then think along the lines of Gandalf vs the Necromancer. If you haven't, look it up. We all respect and love Gandalf but he gets his butt handed to him by the Necromancer. Show impressive magic on both sides but Voldemort should be able to show the most powerful magic.

Also look up Galadriel vs Necromancer if you want the ultimate bad@ss showdown between two people who are extremely powerful.

** In canon they both have a lot of power, but Dumbledore has a lot of research credits to his name while Voldemort traveled widely in search of Dark Arts rituals and magic. I'd build from that and show Dumbledore as having deep knowledge of certain topics (transfiguration, alchemy if you can make it relevant), but Voldemort has a wide breadth of knowledge from all over the world. Dumbledore is able to hold his own because of the combination of his specialization (he's shown in canon to be to use objects around him to block killing curses, for example), quick thinking, and the Elder Wand. If he loses the Elder Wand, Voldemort would have him outclassed in power and he knows too much about magic for Albus to be effective in a fight against him.

It would give you the room to come up with some impressive battle magic uses for transfiguration, and also some really twisted magic for Voldemort to have learned on his travels.

** Perhaps you should take their specialties and take them to the extreme, specifically transfiguration for Dumbledore and curses for Voldemort.

Make it so Dumbledore can literally terraform landscapes when he's serious. The ground, trees, stone, even the very air, make it so it's all like mouldable clay to him, to shape and wield.

For Voldemort have him use specific curses and spells that directly counter that. AOE curses that make it so magic does not effect an area. Debuffs that don't need to hit an enemy to have an effect. And curses that only someone with a truly dark/wild imagination could have created. Even better would be if you could have him use spells that are inspired by chaos gods and lovecraftian horrors.

** It's all about feelings and consequences that each fighters envoke in others. LV magic would take away hope and instill fear in his opponents, also it destructs things in the area it lands. Meanwhile AD magic protects and inspires hope that there is a chance it will all be ok, it creates defenses by animating the surroundings to protect those around him. While LV is powerful and focused on the attack, AD is all about control of the battlefield and protecting others. His knowledge shows up by using a lot less effort to defend than LV uses to attack. Still you should show it to the reader that the LV's power is enormous and he could go on and on, sort of unstoppable force meets unmovable object.

** Well you could have him do something similar to canon where in a duel he can hold his own pretty much on par with Dumbledore despite one using an unbeatable wand and the help of a Phoenix. You could probably emphasize the fact that the only reason he loses or (arguably the duel ends in the draw) because of his ignorance of certain aspects of magic.

** In canon Dumbledore crushes Voldemort and it was clear that if he wasn't holding back he could've probably straight up won.

You can see this when he dedicates two statues to Bellatrix and Harry instead of just killing Bellatrix. He doesn't use dark curses and only tries for capture, never for lethality which Voldemort remarks on. Still with all the handicaps he manages to force Voldemort into retreat.

So maybe you can have Voldemort at a handicap where he's forced to defend his minions and come out ahead against Dumbledore.
