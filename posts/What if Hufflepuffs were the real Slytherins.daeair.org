Is there any Stories in which none of the people sorted into Slytherin are actually Slytherins based on the fact that a trully cunning and manipulative person wont announce to the world that they are manipulative.

Maybe the whole house of Hufflepuffs are the real cunning ones, they created a image of being trustworthy while being the real evil guys behind everything.

in my headcanon you get sorted based on what qualities you /value/ the most, not what you really are. this would also explain some people who don't really fit into their house like Pettigrew.

also "manipulative" is not a trait of Slytherin

** I almost consider this canon considering every Slytherin we see at Hogwarts at least somewhat frequently (Bulstrode, Parkinson, Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle) seem to be exactly what they claim the Gryffindors are (brash, obnoxious, loud and arrogant) more often than not, whereas the Ravenclaws, Hufflepuffs and Gryffindors are busy hosting a secret defense club or in the case of three particular Gryffindors, outsmarting a Dark Lord and being far more on top of detecting and dealing with danger than the teaching staff on a far too consistent basis to claim its just luck.

** Had a similar thought the other day. It meshes nicely with Slytherin being the house where most of the blood purists go, because they care more about status than most, and would ask the hat to put them there.

None of them would admit to /asking/ the hat to do that, of course.

*** Yeah I thought that too. And all the Hufflepuffs asked to go there because they wanted to blend in and not stand out.

** Hufflepuff is also characterized as hard working, which gives them an excuse for why they achieve things. "No, I didn't become Lord of the World by being ambitious and cunning, I just worked hard and this is what it got me." It's like money laundering for power. Power laundering.
