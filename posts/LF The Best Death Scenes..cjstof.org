Looking for your favourite scenes that involve a character death. Do they go to sleep and not wake up? Do they go out with a bang? I'll recommend Dumbledore's death in linkffn(the firebirds song by darth marrs). It was a very satisfying scene as Dumbledore had been slowly expressing more of his magical power before finally going out on his own terms.


** My personal favorite has to be the death of Regulus Black in linkffn(The Art of Self Transfiguration). That whole scene is incredible.

Edit: Wow I had that fic name totally wrong. Thank you bot for nailing it anyways.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.
