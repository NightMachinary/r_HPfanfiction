#+begin_quote
  A month after Dumbledore's death, Harry is depressed and wallowing in grief at Privet Drive. One night, shortly before his seventeenth birthday, Fawkes appears in his room, and whisks him away to a hidden stronghold. There, our hero meets the spirit of Godric Gryffindor, who takes Harry as his apprentice. Harry/Multi. Powerful, not godlike. Intelligent Harry. Ch 2 is NOT missing.
