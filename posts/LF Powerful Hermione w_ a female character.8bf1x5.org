Like the fanfic, "Fractures"


** The "dystopic past universe Harry was ejected from" Hermione was with Ginny in linkff(8823447). (Abandoned fic.)

*** [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]] has assured us that it's not abandoned, but I'm suspicious of that claim because it's not updated in four years. Actually, it's a pain, because that was a really good fic.

**** I prefer the term "continuously neglected". These four dark years were necessary to ensure the safety of the story. Something something choices.

***** So is it going to be updating again any time soon, or are you too busy working on other stuff?

****** This is tough to answer. My plans seem to have had zero effect on results with this story so far.

I'll say this: I'd love to finish year one before Hermione's birthday this year, and I already have a rewritten/reordered chapter and two new chapters to post.

This represents half of what I think is left in Year One for this story. I also think they're really good.

Take that as you will.
