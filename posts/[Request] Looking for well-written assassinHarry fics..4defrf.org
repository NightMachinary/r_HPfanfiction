  An assassin goes around, killing off high profile targets everywhere. Nobody knows how he looks like. Nobody knows how he manages to overcome the best and oldest wards. One thing they do know is that he never fails. His name? Gabriel. / Dark story, not suited for children.

There's a good one I can't find that has Harry and Hermione as hired wands with other mercenaries who are hired to hunt 'Harry Potter'

  Harry Potter is sent to prision for a crime he did commit. Now they need their hero back but he's lost all interest in saving them. They threw him away and now its going to cost them. Note rating! One-shot.

** linkffn(10071063) - This is one of my very favourite fics in HP. It is a oneshot so it is a good, quick read. I can't really describe it without giving spoilers so just give it a try!

linkffn(9132770) - is a fic that is a guilty pleasure of mine in which Harry assassinates Death Eaters remotely by using his link with Voldemort.

  "Clear your mind!" wasn't actually the best advice. Harry is fed up and takes things into his own hands and discovers a way to end the war on his own terms. No one was expecting this of the Gryffindor Golden Boy.

  In canon, healers and mediwitches were seemingly spared from the predations of the Death Eaters during both Blood Wars. St. Mungo's would have been a very soft target, but it stood inviolate. One patient was attacked, but the hospital and it's staff were spared. The question is, why? What could have kept mad killers in check? As with a great many other things, Poppy knew.

** This is the one that immediately comes to mind.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4532363/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sun-Source]]

Harry raised by assassins. Pretty well written too. All the bullshit "assassin stuff" he does is canon compliant stuff for the other half crossover, it's not just the author wanking over bullshit OP Harry. I mean, he is OP, but it's really entertaining.
