Make a series of one-shots with different characters facing boggarts. Not necessarily strictly true to canon, so Harry's boggart might be Voldemort or his uncle, for example. Basically just the character facing the boggart and then the fallout. Some ideas I had were:

- Harry: Voldemort, Uncle Vernon
- Hermione: Basilisk, Cerberus, Witch burning
- Ginny: Tom Riddle's diary
- Snape: Subvert the canon boggart; seeing himself killing Lily Potter
- Lupin: A rat/dog (depending on time of one-shot)
- Voldemort: A nose (got to have a light-hearted one in there somewhere)
- Neville: His parents being tortured (because really, Snape is worse that /that/?)

Etc. Etc.
