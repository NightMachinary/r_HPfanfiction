Hello everyone! I am a total fanfic virgin but I REALLY want to read some HP! The HP books are my favorite books of all time and I've always wished that there were more sequels. I've perused other posts also asking for suggestions on where to start, so I went to Archive of Our Own to try to sort through stuff. The problem is, the filters on that site are just not what I'm going for. I'm really hoping you guys can help me narrow down some stuff for me to start with!

I am really interested in whatever happens post Deathly Hallows. I don't mind alternate universe stuff but for starting out, I want to stay on canon and I'm definitely not interested in crossovers. I have no problem whatsoever with M/M being in a story, but I don't want it to be the main focus of the plot. I also wouldn't stop reading or change my opinion of a story if I came across rape/non-con or underage, but I would honestly rather not.

Other than post-DH, I would also be interested in reading anything about Dumbledore, whether pre-HP or during, as he is my absolute favorite character. In his case, I would not mind a M/M focused storyline, since that goes with his original characterization. I just don't think I'd like to stray too much from their original personalities yet, unless, of course, they change due to circumstances in their lives or something. For instance, I'd be totally fine with reading something with Harry being raised by Sirius, or if Harry ended up being able to move to Sirius' house after PoA.

Romance, adventure, scary (does that even exist in HP fanfic? I sure wouldn't say no to some HP zombie craziness since I have a zombies obsession haha), I like it allllll.

Really sorry if my preferences are too vague (or the total opposite lol). I know there is an insane amount of HP fanfic. I very much appreciate any and all recommendations you guys can offer me. Thank you in advance.


** FF.net has a Post-Hogwarts (DH) setting, but as for AO3, the easiest way to find some excellent post-war stories would be to simply search through the main canon pairings sorted by Kudos (HP/GW, RW/HG). Lots of material to be found from authors who wanted to fill in the gap before the Epilogue.

** I got into HP fan fiction the same way you did - interest in what happens after Deathly Hallows. Someone else suggested "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4367121/1/The-First-Day][The First Day]]" by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1443437/little0bird][little0bird]], which was the first fic I ever read and was exactly what I was looking for. Be warned that many of the characters are going through some level of PTSD. The story is really good, though hits your emotions hard (at least it did for me). Good luck as you plunge into HP fanfic! linkffn(4367121)

*** No problem at all with PTSD, especially since it is unsurprising, given what they all went through and all the people they lost. I like emotional reads so this sounds right up my alley.

Thank you so much for your recommendation! I'm thinking of starting either with the Northumbrian fanfic or with what you recommended. I really appreciate it!

** First off, welcome to the fanfic community! We're cranky folk, prone to bitching about grammar and posting at all hours of the day about weird shower thoughts and whimsical requests for all manner of merry fuckery, and we can't agree on anything. But as the kids probably don't say these days but absolutely still should - this shit's dope, yo. :)

Personally, I'd say the best way to find good starter fics is to do a sub-search (in case you're unaware, reddit has a search bar, with a tick-box to limit your search to this subreddit only) here for things you're interested in (and do be willing to go back a few years - there's plenty of stuff that used to be recommended often and isn't anymore). Request, What's that Fic, and Recommendation posts tend to be quite specific vis a vis topic and content, so it should be relatively easy to find the specific things you want. And make sure to synonym your search terms (eg: Post Deathly Hallows, Post-DH, Post-books, After the books, Next Generation, etc) because sometimes people use different words to describe the same thing.

Searching on the sites themselves is usually best to do when you've read the usual suspects that get recommended here, in my opinion. At that point, you've developed your own tastes and gotten a better idea of the fandom language you'd need to search specific things.

*** Yeahhh, I don't know anything about searching through subreddits, other than just clicking the search bar at the top and doing a basic keyword search within the sub.

Thanks for your help! I'm sure I can figure it out, now that I am aware that is possible lol.

That is pretty much all you need to know, though. You'll pick up on the keywords soon enough.

** These aren't the kind you were looking for, but neglect fics are one of the most common tropes in the fandom and these are probably the best of the bunch from what I've read, so you can try these if you feel like it.

Prince Of Slytherin isn't drastically AU and is still being updated, but it's got some of the best world building I've seen in a long time.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][Harry Potter and The Prince Of Slytherin]]

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][Saving Connor]]

This is a 7 part series and EXTREMELY long, along with being quite AU, diverging from cannon more and more as the series progresses. The pairing is Harry/Draco however this doesn't start until the later stories and definitely isn't the main focus.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]]

While this isn't a neglect fic it is one of the funnier things in the fandom I've read. Harry being a horcrux has the unintended side affect of him thinking he is lord Voldemort, who thinks hermione's an evil mastermind, Dumbledore is constantly out to get him and is the most successful dark lord, and treats Ron and the rest of the weasleys like his minions.

Not sure how I feel about a Draco/Harry pairing haha. Draco is just such a little shit in the original books. Definitely an interesting concept.

The Seventh Horcrux sounds hilarious! I'm gonna have to add it to my list for sure.

** My standard answer for introductory HP post-war fanfics is [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Nineteen Years and Beyond]] series by Northumbrian (start with “Tales of the Battle” and then go on), and [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?uid=143134][Stories by Mrs_Granger]] (Summer goes before Winter).

** Yeah, I'm far from a fanfic virgin and I pretty much never use ao3. Everyone says the searching and filtering works so much better than ffn's does, but I find it unusable. Well, unusable unless you want to read some freaky a/b/o smut, because that all I ever seem to find when I try to search there. That being said, ffn's search is pretty much only good for finding poorly written garbage that's inexplicably popular. This subreddit is the best way to find new fics, imo. I think there's a link to a google doc in the sidebar that's the most recommended fics from here most of those are great.

Best post DH fic is technically Alexandra Quick, but that's set in America and has nothing to do with HP. It's just a different story in the same universe. That being said, I think Loose Cannon by Manatee-vs-Walrus is exactly what you're looking for. Long, meandering, emotional, and best of all updated weekly.

linkffn(13452914)

I don't think I've got any Dumbledore fics to recommend. I almost never read fics set pre-1980. Not sure why, they just don't appeal to me for some reason.

I've read a few HP zombie fics, but I can't link any because they're all terminally stupid. A competent wizard is basically unstoppable versus a zombie apocalypse, so the characters are always brutally nerfed and/or horribly incompetent to make it so that the plot can happen.

*** Yeah I was mostly kidding about the HP zombie stuff lol. I figured it would be a silly concept.

I'll have to explore this sub more I guess. I don't use Reddit all that much, other than some occasional lurking, commenting, and minor posting so I really don't know how to make use of any advanced searching, other than just searching within a specific sub at the top.

I felt the same way about the ao3 searches. They all brought up weird smut that didn't have all that many kudos and were not at all what I was looking for.

Thank you for your recommendation!

**** I do think the zombie thing could be done well, I just haven't encountered it done well. I think for every thing you can think of, even the ridiculous cliches, there's some talented mofo in the community who can make it work beautifully. Just gotta stumble across the mofo, which in the case of zombies I have not, yet.

Here's the [[https://reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/7apsxo/meta_top_100_most_recommended_fics_on/][google doc]] I mentioned. It looks like it hasn't been updated since 2018, but it's still a massive collection of great fics.

****** Yeah, the great thing about a doc like that is that good fics are still good 3 years later. I'm glad I did track it down, because I think it's been updated with some stuff I haven't read before. I'd say I'm hyped, but my saved folder in reddit has dozens of fics I'm waiting to read in it so the pile is starting to get a bit overwhelming!
