I really don't care who, but Bellamione and Hermione/Luna are awesome for the spectrum of Fluff to Hardcore


** This one comes up fairly often: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10099028/1/Murder-Most-Horrid][Murder Most Horrid]]

It's an AU where Bellatrix works for the DMLE. She interrogates Hermione, for a particular case, and... I guess that's enough for one thing to lead to another. Haven't read it in a good while, but I remember it being okay at the very least.

  Sequel to The Power of Love: Voldemort is back, the Ministry is in denial, and Dumbledore is stalling, but Jasmine isn't alone. She and Hermione are supported by new friends, defended by two shieldmaidens, and empowered by ancient magic. Eliminating Voldemort is the least of the tasks which prophecy expects from them, but how will these witches transform the whole magical world?

  The moment Hermione ran smack into Bellatrix Lestrange in the midst of a war was the moment she knew things were about to go very badly, very quickly. Rated M for more than one reason.

** Despite my below reservations, I quite enjoyed linkffn(7559031). In a review for a DLP library thread, I wrote:

#+begin_quote
  The story is structured oddly, entirely contained in its first half with the realities of life at Shell Cottage before exploding into a lot of very sudden (but very cool) world-building at Hogwarts that feels like it belongs to another story. As Newcomb mentioned, the post-battle cleanup is incredibly well done, and the highlight of the work.

  Can't help but think the author wouldn't be better served by hatcheting off several thousand words. The endless cycle of angst, self-doubt, and introspection begins to feel very claustrophobic---it's realistic given the context, but repetitive and not always pleasant to read. But after a rocky first chapter, the quality of the prose is among the best in the fandom, and the author has an excellent knack for character voice.

  Many excellent insights into Hermione's character, and into her relationship with Harry and Ron. (Not as good as Vera Rozalsky's /Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation/, but what is?) The consequences of her role in the raid on Malfoy Manor were smartly portrayed (as traumatic and damaging, but not in a way that strips her character of its ability or autonomy).

  Found the final treatment of Ron quite disappointing. I get why the author made the choices she did . . . but given her level of skill, I'd wish she'd seen fit to better subvert the tropes surrounding his character.

  Revelations at the end were clever and well-executed.

I recall [[http://likeadeuce.livejournal.com/1003241.html][this]] Hermione/Luna oneshot being enjoyable, as well.
