Found several very positive recommendations for this story, but the story's original link has gone bad. Does anyone have a local backup copy to share, perhaps?


** Email the person over at lostdhrfics on tumblr, she has all of everythursdays fics, you have to email her though, her email can be found on her page

*** I see, I should've searched for entire everythursday collection backup links, not just the story itself. Found one such folder on gDr, thank you for the hint.
