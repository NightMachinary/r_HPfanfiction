Maybe its the classism, the specieism, the lack of electricity, or just the fashion style. Whatever it is, MC just looks around and nopes right out of it. Doesnt matter if he/she goes back to the Muggles, moves abroad, or is just completely insulting to everything and everyone around, I just want fics where the MC wont adapt to whats around him.

Ideally, I would much prefer if the main character wasnt Hermione, but its not a deal breaker. More importantly; the longer, the better.


** You generally have to put up with Hermione as main characters in these kind of fics. Almost all authors who write them have a very dismal view of Magical Britain. Examples:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(10595005): After overthrowing the Ministry because of a marriage law, they executed most of the Wizengamot and a large portion of the traditional establishment, completely reorganized the Ministry, significantly altered Hogwarts curriculum, redefined all magical creature laws, replaced quills with pens, stopped wearing robes, and radically changed how magical wars would be fought. Foreign pureblood regimes, however, would have none of that.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10322302/1/Screw-Them][Screw Them]] and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10533939/1/We-re-Screwed][We're Screwed]], linkffn(10533939): Harry and his supporters created a rival magical society that eventually undermined Hogwarts and Ministry. This author is in a way more radical than Starfox5, who at least depicts Magical France as a worse shit hole than Britain.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1227033/Marquis-Black][Emperor]], linkffn(1227033): The first chapter is the Epilogue and depicts Harry ordering the destruction of Hogwarts. That should tell you enough how Harry views the traditional magical societies.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8837257/1/Wizards-Fall][Wizards Fall]], linkffn(8837257): Harry and his friends built a rival society and eventually screwed over Magical Britain using some kind of schemes.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6160345/1/My-Slytherin-Harry][My Slytherin Harry]], linkffn(6160345): Harry and Ginny left Magical Britain after offing Voldemort.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion]], linkffn(4655545): Badly traumatized and deranged Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Susan travelled back in time, killed their enemies again, did the Goblins in, completely shook up Magical Britain's system, and left the country with Sirius.

*** Starfox5's Marriage Law Revolution is my favorite of his fics. I feel the characters are the most balanced.

I myself would love to see a fic like DADA boycott, but on a smaller scale.

*** Thanks for the recommendations, I only read Reunion and the first few chapters of Emperor. (Never really got into it, which is weird, given that its superbly written and the story is right up my alley)

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

  The Wizarding World is confronted with a problem they never had to face before. The consquences of their own arrogance and bigotry. After Hogwarts lost dozens of students each year, they try to change things again. But what do you do if you realise that things aren't that easy? Sequel to Screw Them
