- Umbridge strode forward like an arriving bride. One step, match feet, opposite step, match feet, right step--\\
  A brief yelp snapped everyone's attention to the Inquisitrix' sudden drop into a hole. A moment later a sawhorse painted in yellow and black stripes dropped from the ceiling to straddle the hole. It then popped out a flag that said, 'Warning! Moral foundation under construction- existing rot may cause further sinkholes to appear'\\
  Several students had leaped up in surprise, and a few were now edging towards the shadowed hole into which Madam Umbridge had disappeared. In particular, Gregory Goyle had shuffled up to the edge. He then demonstrated his particular talent- drool dripping, extending a string of saliva from his lip a few feet into the well before slurping it back up into his mouth.\\
  The stone beneath him also disappeared, and he fell into the widened hole, his girlish shriek cut off as soon as he had dropped fully beneath some event horizon just below the floor.\\
  "And that's why Hermione is the most dangerous witch in this school. She has a point to make."


** The headmaster exhorted, "Can't you find anything civil to say to each other?"

Snape said, "You make a very convincing dog."

Sirius nodded and said, "Thank you, Snape."

"Sirius, your turn..."

The man smirked. He turned to Snape and said, "I look forward to the day when this war is done, and I can think nostalgically about your death."

Snape scoffed, twirled into his cloak and strode out of the room.

Sirius called out, "It'll be a good death, I'm sure. Very successful."

** The waitress interrupted their conversation to bus plates away, though it was obvious that she did so in order to wave her boobs in Harry's face.

Ginny said, "I'm sorry -- I didn't realise when you offered cream for his coffee that you meant to dispense straight from your udders."

** Another one, less funny:

Today, Holly shopped.

This wouldn't be remarkable except that every other occasion that she'd gone shopping, someone else was with her. This time she shopped alone, with money she'd earned.

/On my back, at the tip of a knife, or in front of a class, these are my wages. Everything I buy today is for me./

Vintage and charity shops drew her tread, not just for the lower prices but for the residue of former owners that she could sometimes feel. Some places she'd spend hours touching all the little treasures calling back to their prior owners or pleading to be valued anew. Other places she would take two steps in and realise that there was nothing for her within- either the objects were silent or they were broken, and there was no reason to embroil her life with their dysfunctions.

Trawling down the aisles in a charity shop, she stopped to touch a white domino mask sitting atop a jewelry box. It hung in her memory as she searched the racks for clothes of decent fit and fashion. Probably eight times she wandered back to that mask. It was formed well by some dedicated hand, using a mould of plaster covered in white fabric. She held it up against her face. The eyeholes were cut wide enough to fit comfortably, allowing her eyelashes to move unhindered. The felt backing rested on her cheeks and brow- the fit made it as comfortable as wearing a layer of foundation.

Once back in her cloister at the school, Holly inspected the mask again. She drew a quill and filled it with ink, then wrote above the eyebrow ridge in thread-thin script: /... she wore a ... white mask .../

Holly attached silk ribbon to the eyelets and tied the mask in place on her face. Looking up into her vanity mirror, she tilted her head this way and that, testing the fit and look of it.

Winky gasped into existence next to her. "Who is you be," the panicked elf said, "and where is the Polter professor?!"

/New rule: never underestimate the power of the printed word./
