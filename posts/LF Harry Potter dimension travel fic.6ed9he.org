Looking for a HP fic where Harry goes missing while young and reappears because of the GoF. He is older then canon and is part of a monster hunter guild/clan. Can't remember much else of the story.


** could it possibly be this? linkffn(11000408)

  Harry Potter had disappeared from Privet Drive before Petunia had ever woken in the morning. Now thirteen years later his name came out of the Goblet of Fire. What will the Wizarding World think of a Harry Potter raised by a civilization thought lost to tragedy
