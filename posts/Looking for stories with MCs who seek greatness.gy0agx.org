I enjoy reading stories about greatness, and so I'm looking for stories where the main character aspires to become the greatest in a field or fields of magic. It doesn't matter which field, be it potions, transfiguration, charms, enchanting, etc. as longs as the mc actively seeks to become the greatest.

*** Thank you for your suggestion. I've already read though, I'm afraid. As you say, it's pretty good, but quite depressing all the same.

I'm not quite familiar with the meaning of your last sentence.

**** It's a Saying that I've made up so to say The Three Friends are Lord Death, Lady Magic, and Lady Fate (or Luck) who watch over the mortals in their domains Mountains; Valleys and Fertal places; and the Air, Water, and Sea (respectively) They also oversee the weaving of the great Looms of Time. They also have other names but I don't know them
