I don't care what characters are in it, what it's about, or how long the story is, just as long as the writing is wildly out of character and the authors are absolutely serious/earnest about it.

I'd like stuff more along the lines robst or James Spookie than /My Immortal/ trollfics. Things that would earn a spot in the literary version of /MST3K/, in other words.

The more character bashing, stilted monologues, and implausible soulbonds, the better. I need a laugh.
