Hi there,

I'm looking for a fic in which Harry grows up where I grew up. The german speaking part of europe (Germany, Austria, Switzerland). I only know of one fic where Harry learns Potions from a Master somewhere in the Carinthian Alps during a short stay there.

So, yea... do you know of any?


** There's one where he grows up with Victor Krum and Draco in Bulgaria where he is raised by the black family but I don't know the name of it

*** Oh, yea... I read this one.

Its not very good, if I remember correctly.

I have one scene in my head which can be summarized like this:

#+begin_quote
  Harry,Draco and Viktor entered the hall. With grandeur in his voice, Draco announced "Behold the Black brothers!"

  And The Great Hall shook with the force of hundreds of panties dropping.

**** I am sorry, but this scene still doesn't even come close to the one of a fic where Harry and his adopted brother Blaise make their first Great Hall entrance on their rumbling motorcycles.
