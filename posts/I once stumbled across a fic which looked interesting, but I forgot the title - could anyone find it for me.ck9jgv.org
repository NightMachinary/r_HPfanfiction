:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Basically, it's set in the summer after Harry's 4th (or 5th) year, and Voldemort is frustrated that he still hasn't killed Harry. I'm sure that one of the key locations in the fic is Privet Drive. I think the last line of the summary is something like "this time, he's going in for the kill". Thanks for any help :)
