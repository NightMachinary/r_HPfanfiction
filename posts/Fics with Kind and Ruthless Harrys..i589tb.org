A Harry who is a genuinely kind person who cares about others. He will look for gentle and just solutions and go far out of his way to apply them, if it's possible - and it often is. But he'll also be as ruthless as the situation demands and do horrible things without ruining is own life agonizing over it.

He'll non-lethally subdue people he passionately hates to bring them in for a proper trial, even if it's significantly more difficult than killing them.

He'll capture enemies and destroy their minds for information without hesitation, if it's necessary.

That sort of thing.

The Harry from linkffn(The Master of Death by rgm0005) is a decent example.

 

Any recommendations for particularly good fics that have a Harry like this?

  In one world, an old man's life ends. In another, a foolish wizard performs a ritual and calls upon the Master of Death. And in both, there is a sound-a sound like an oncoming train. To the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.

  An attempt to go against a popular trope. What if, instead of becoming dark/grey and gaining more power that way, Harry had been a little more considerate? Begins with a small change in first year, and sticks close to the original, but sometimes small changes can add up to change the world.

** Actually, the character that springs to mind isn't Harry; it's the Paragon protagonist from With This Ring. In his first year he mostly tries to avoid lethal force, since he's on the Young Justice team and their rules of engagement emphasise non-lethal takedowns. And he really does try hard to find diplomatic and reasonable solutions to things. But when push comes to shove, he can genocide an entire Evil Empire and not lose sleep over it.

The Renegade protagonist, who doesn't feature much until later in the story, is a great deal more ruthless. Still a good person, still generous to his friends, devoted family man, and committed to the greater good, but if, say, you invade his home and threaten him, you probably won't be bound in orange construct chains, knocked out, and handed over to the police; you'll get a giant sword through your chest.
