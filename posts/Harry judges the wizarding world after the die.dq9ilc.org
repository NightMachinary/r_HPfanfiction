:END:
Looking for a fix where hery is betrayed and dies but becomes someone who judges souls when they pass on. I remember every chapter was a different person and there was a list of what they did in life and how it affects them in the afterlife like remus was sent to a very tall mountain and told to climb it if he wished for forgiveness and then hermione had a few betrayal things but was forgiven by harry so could join harry in the afterlife thanks I have been looking for it for awhile

  In deference to The Professional and his wonderful stories. Harry has lost everything; a failed attempt to fix his mistakes leaves him as the Lone Traveller, a part of Wizarding legend. This is "Complete" because the length is getting unwieldy. I stopped at a good point. The sequel is up.
