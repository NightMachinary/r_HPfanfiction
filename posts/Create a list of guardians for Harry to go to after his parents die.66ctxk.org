Put yourselves in Lily and James' shoes and come up with contingency plans for Harry should you die during the war.

(based off a discussion in the thread posted earlier today)


** - I'm sure that the first choice would be Sirius. As for the second and third choices, I'd probably say Peter and then Remus, although the latter might be difficult due to his /ahem/ 'furry little problem'.

Fourth would maybe be some of Lily's friends? Although, I don't think canon ever explicitly goes into her friendship group, but I like to imagine that she would've been close enough to one or two people to make them good choices. Otherwise, I'd say the Longbottoms would be a good shout for number four, not least because of Neville - as you can imagine it would be quite a decision to give custody of your child to someone who has little-to-no experience or doesn't want them - so the Longbottoms fit quite nicely here.

Other than that, maybe - /and I mean, maybe/ - they'd give Harry to someone like Professor McGonagall? I like to think that they were both close to her, not least due to being Head Boy and Girl, top students and both good Gryffindors - well, in seventh year at least, in James' case!

Although, this is of course assuming that they wouldn't just want Petunia to have custody of Harry in the event of a disaster, in which case Petunia would probably place number three/four on the list, in my mind.

The real problem with a whole contingency plan is how little of James & Lily's lives and friendships are explored in canon, leaving the whole lot open to endless reinterpretation on our end. But ah well, here's my contribution.

*** I would think the married couple with a child Harry's age would be the /first/ candidate. Only if they were unable would someone give custody to a single man who had never had a child. I assume Sirius would be first in that line due to godfather status.

*** Part of it is also just the fanfics with "wills" (who the fuck has their will written at the age of 20) that put Harry with everyone and explicitly say not to put him with Petunia. Lily may not get along with Petunia, but she doesn't hate her. and it makes sense that their kid goes to a closely related living relative over some random friend or a second cousin once removed. I also personally like the interpretation of Petunia hating wizards for taking her sister away from her more than anything else, which only got worse after it became permanent with her death. I can easily imagine them reconciling when they're older, Dudley growing up, etc.

Like, irl, if my parents were to have died when I was young, I would have likely been placed with their siblings, even if they're not especially close. The order of distant family>close friends seems most realistic. It's just confounded in HP by the Dursley's being atrocious, fairy tale stories, etc.

Canon didn't realy have space to explore James and Lily's lives and friendships beyond their relationship to Harry. For all we know, Lily's only other friend was Mary MacDonald. Fanfics often make them friends with Alice and Frank, presumably because of the Order, but Alice and Frank are a couple years older (and we see minimal cross-year friendships in canon).

Yes, who in their right mind would make a will while being hunted by a madman and their friends fighting and dying left and right. Complete and utter madness!11!!

Oh and I'm sure if you're ever fighting in a resistance group during a war typing up a will will not seem so daunting to you anymore. "I guess we could die any day, but Oh this is going to take like more than 20 minutes, let's not bother and leave everything up to luck" said no-one ever.

** I actually don't think they thought that much about it. They were 20, war or no war, and they wouldn't think much further than 'godfather/other mauraders, whoever Lily's closest friends were'. It wouldn't occur to them Petunia was a candidate, because wizard baby hunted by dark lord, and they were estranged from her. By Petunias choice.

We know there were no other close relatives. It's hard to tell, but it's possible Andromeda is the next closest viable relative.

If only the other Marauders were on the list, then it wasn't such a dumb move to get him out of the magical world; James Potter is at least related to Charlus Potter, which means that he is at least related to the Blacks and other dubious characters through marriage.

** Would this even be a question that's relevant in terms of the cannon magical world? We can assume Sirius didn't have a will, since I'm pretty sure that there's no mention of that in the book (regardless of Fannons obsession with it). We see that Dumbledore had a will, but that was dealt with by the sitting Minister, not something that could be common. We also know that the magical world split away from the muggle world centuries before the story begins, in a time when nobody but the elite bothered with wills. So all this leads me to say; I don't think the Potters would have a will, they possess little in the way of money (1 small vault) a single home that was likely inherited and no positions of power (like Dumbledore).

** I've always wondered what happened to Lily's parents. We know that they died but how? Lily was only 21 when she died and they apparently passed away before. Also did James and Lily not have any cousins or aunts and uncles? James was an only child but did none of his parents have siblings or cousins? And Lily in the muggle world surely must have had muggle relations through her parents. Do they not exist, or did they all mysteriously expire?

Honestly the bigger problem for me is the secret keeper issue. Why didn't James or Lily be their own secret-keepers? It's shown to be possible in the last book, and they knew someone in the Order was a traitor. Why did they not have a portkey on them? Dumbledore was influential enough to get them one. James died trying to buy time for them (in what was a wasted effort. Really didn't understand Voldemort calling his death brave.) Lily had enough time to get to her wand and try /something/. She could have tried to fight, disapparate, cast something instead of pushing furniture against the door and begging. But ultimately, they were young, unprepared and in over their heads. I don't think the possibility of dying became real until that night, and thus the lack of contingency plans.

** I dont think Lily and James would even consider the possibility that they both die during the war, without harry dying as well. They were literally hiding their child from Voldemort himself and they probably thought that its more likely that Harry would be killed after the death of both of them and that their primary concern should be to survive the war and raise Harry themself.

But the only choices I would think of are Sirius and Peter because they are the only ones who are trusted by James and Lily not to be the spy. It was a civil war I dont think they could trust anyone beyond their best friends not to turn on Harry should Voldemort confront them. The safest place would actually be with a muggle or a squib living in the muggle world but I doubt they trusted anyone enough no to sacrifice Harry in favour of their own family.

** Dumbledore. He is the safest and best person for Harry to go to in the event Lily and James die during the war (when they likely created their wills). And since by then, they have discovered the prophecy from Dumbledore (or at least the amount Dumbledore knew), it's only natural that Dumbledore would be the one capable of helping Harry train the power "The Dark Lord knows Not".

There's also several other reasons, such as Dumbledore being an amazing mentor and father figure, I think that having a sort of son would make Dumbledore a little more battle-hardened when the war reignited because if he doesn't kill, he has something to lose, someone that depends on him. Dumbledore would also likely accept it and fulfil his duties to the T (unlike Petunia, Sirius, Remus, etc...). He's also the only one we fully know on the list, whereas putting him with someone like Agusta or Andromeda, is a shot in the dark.

Sirius. This would mostly be at James' request, as the fact that a mini-version of him would be running around and furthering his legacy would be the best possible outcome for him. There's also the fact that Sirius is financially stable, capable of supporting a baby. He will be available both physically and emotionally. And he will understand Harry when they come across the whole Teen-Angst phase. Sirius raising a Soldier isn't likely to happen, or maybe it is? Who knows what would become of a Sirius that survived the war, while most of his friends died around him.

/Insert Female Order Member that already has had Children/. I think that having Children would be a big plus in Lily and James' eyes, there's also the fact that they fought with these people and trust them with their lives. If they could get any of them onboard, they would definitely be somewhere down the line. But this would then create the spoiled Harry we were worried about, he has absolutely no chance of winning the oncoming storm and defeating the Dark Lord. So while he'll have an extremely good childhood, his adolescent years would be filled with death and likely destruction, before ultimately falling at the hands of the dark lord.

Orphanage. Now, you may be asking yourself, "why would Lily and James attempt to send Harry to an orphanage?" But the reasoning for my decision is based on the more likely scenario that Lily and James didn't have a will, or didn't think to write one.
