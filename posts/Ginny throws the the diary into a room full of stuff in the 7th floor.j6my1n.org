Okay instead of being near a bathroom when she gets rid of the diary. She happens to be up in the 7th floor. And is pacing nervous and worried, then she sees a door appear on the wall, curious she looks inside and sees a ton of junk. And tosses the diary into the room, and rushes off as the door fades into a blank wall.


** This actually happened in “The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel” linkao3(14078862), but somebody found out about the Room of Hidden Things and subsequently the diary got to hands of somebody else (NO SPOILERS!).
