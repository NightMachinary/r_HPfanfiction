** If you're still interested and don't mind a 17k+ ongoing story, linkffn(12698097) features a mermaid OC protagonist; I think she will eventually meet/get close to Harry and the main cast.

  You came, you saw, you survived. But at the end of the day, you're still children. It doesn't matter how many battles you've won, how many Dark Lords have been triumphed, or how many personal travesties become medals of honor. You deserve better; the Sun is out now. [mermaid!SI/OC, many odd couples]
