What if the sniveling coward of a wizard we all hate was more than a follower?

What if instead of being a rat, he was a wyrm animagus?

By finding that he has the power to become his own man, perhaps Wyrmtail can grow into the Gryffindor the Sorting Hat thought he could be.

With the heart of a dragon and mind of a serpent, Peter Pettigrew will stand by his friends and guard their secrets with every ounce of power he holds! Even in the face of Voldemort, he will not break.


** You know what occurs to me? In the very first Final Fantasy, the king of dragons, Bahamut, would grant your party a stat-boosting class change if you brought him the Rat's Tail from the Citadel of Trials.

--------------

It was when searching through the Hogwarts library, looking for ways to ward himself against Voldemort and his Death Eaters, that Peter found it.\\
Instructions as to the art of summoning and bargaining with spirits; an archaic, finicky art which fell out of practice, when wizards unwilling to be beholden to spirits instead turned to wandlore.\\
But, as Peter's eyes flicked through the pages, his gaze settled on one spirit in particular...\\
 \\
Later...in a chamber deep in the dungeons of Hogwarts, there was a flash of light and a whoosh of flame before a draconic creature shimmered into being, unfurling its wings before casting its stern gaze over Peter Pettigrew.\\
/It has been a long time since I was last sought out. What is it that you seek?/ It...spoke, somehow, without its jaws moving.\\
"Lord Bahamut, I am P-Peter Pettigrew." Peter answered nervously, "Would you be willing to accept an offering of a rat's tail and grant me your boon?"\\
The dragon, Bahamut, blinked slowly and deliberately, /I will, provided that you obtained such a tail via a feat of bravery and strength. Do you have one to present to me?/\\
Peter hesitantly nodded, before he knelt down and transformed, shrinking down into the form of a common rat.\\
 \\
Several rooms away, a gaggle of Slytherins looked up from their potions homework as a deep-voiced laugh echoed through the halls.\\
"Sounds like Peeves is up to something big." One of them grumbled.\\
 \\
A few minutes later, after Bahamut had apologised for his case of the giggles and Peter had explained just how he had learned to turn into a rat, the dragon king had folded his wings and was looking contemplative.\\
/Your tail and your finding me speaks more to your cunning than your courage,/ he finally declared, /While, it would be improper for me to grant you a title of valor under such circumstances, if you seek protection for yourself and others from the dark sorcerer plaguing your lands...I could be persuaded to grant you a different gift in exchange for your rat's tail./\\
A few more questions were asked, a bargain was struck, and Peter felt /something/ leave him, and something else take its place.\\
 \\
It was only after the dragon king was dismissed with profuse thanks, and only after he tried to transform to sneak back to Gryffindor tower, that Peter discovered that Bahamut hadn't just taken his rodent-form's tail; he had taken his animagus form entirely, and replaced it with something substantially...bigger.

** Sounds awesome, but not enough authors like wormtail enough to write a decent version of him
