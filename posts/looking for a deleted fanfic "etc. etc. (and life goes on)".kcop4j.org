Hi everyone! I am looking for this very cool fanfic "etc. etc. (and life goes on)" by justonemorefic that was published on fanfiction.net and harrypotterfanfiction.net. It was deleted:( the author didnt delete their other works though. Does anyone know what happened? Or if I could get a copy of it?


** Try putting the authors profile page in the way back machine Or you could dm the author - it's worth a shot - sometimes they just don't want it to be public, but they're willing to give it out to individual people

*** Thank you so much!! I had dmed the author but did not think they would response, because their last update was in 2016. But through Wayback Machine I found that the author deleted some of her fanfics just recently. I also found them as well! Thank you again.
