So, if you have been around the fandom long enough chances are that you have already found at least one story in response to the somewhat (in)famous challenge, frankly many of them are extremely cringe, but sometimes we find some like Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12332402/1/Why-Shouldn-t-You-Get-Fired-Again]]) that manages to turn the whole thing upon it's head. Looking for more stories like that, the more subverted the better.

  Harry's dead, and his Death will get fired if Harry doesn't go back. Well... hmm. Let's think about this... /oneshot, mild angst, minor Dumbledore-bashing and Weasley-bashing; riff on Reptilia28's 'Don't Fear The Reaper' challenge/
