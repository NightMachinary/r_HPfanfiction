What made you do so? How much do you support them? What is your reward for doing son?


** Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't profiting (at all) from writing fanfiction a clear copyright violation? Didn't I read that J.K.R. doesn't mind the HP fanfiction scene because there is no profit made from her work?

*** Making money off of someone else's intellectual property would bring about a swift cease and desist. Someone else has publishing rights. Someone else has film rights. Someone else has audio rights. You can't steal their ideas and publish your own stories (for profit) based on it without compensating them.

Even if the author was okay with noncommercial use, they would be obligated to sick the lawyers on a for-profit person. You have to defend your IP fanatically or you could lose a future case.

AFAIK (and IANAL), that's a common misconception with respect to copyrights. Whereas /trademarks/ are an enforce-it-or-lose-it deal, copyright enforcement and non-enforcement are entirely at the copyright owner's and licensees' discretion. (There /is/ the doctrine of latches, but the US Supreme Court seems to have ruled recently that it doesn't really affect copyright law; and if the copyright owner publicly promises not to sue over fanfic, and then decides to sue, promisory estoppel might stop them, but it's likely that even those that given an explicit permission, rather than tacitly tolerate it, stipulate that it's for noncommercial purposes only.)

*** AFAIK (and IANAL), in the US, at least, whether infringement is commercial or not makes no difference as far as law is concerned.

Non-commercial use is more likely to be considered Fair Use, but from what I've read, the dichotomy is usually commercial versus educational, so recreational use might be lumped with commercial.

So, it's a copyright violation either way (or not --- I think the matter is legally ambiguous at the moment, since there haven't been much legal precedent set), and while making money from fanfic might make more likely that one gets sued (at the discretion of the copyright owner) and might affect damages awarded by a judge or a jury, it doesn't actually affect the legal status.

** I don't know how I feel about this. I came across someone in a different fandom that was taking commissions for their work. Basically, people would pay them to write a one-shot fanfiction. Usually it's just 10,000 words or less of a romantic scene someone had in their head. I wouldn't do that, and I think it's a little pretentious of this person to do it. Why would someone pay /you/ to write something when there are entire forums dedicated to people willing to do it for free? Apparently people feel the same because she's only had two or three people actually pay her. I wouldn't pay them on Patreon because I morally don't think being paid for faniction is ok, even thought Patreon would be legal.

I'm also in the same boat with fan art. There are people who make a ton of money on Patreon making fan art, and while it's legal, it just seems a little off to me. People who do fan art or fanfiction are working really hard. The really famous people put the same amount of effort and work (and even more in some cases) in what they do than the original creators. So when I see people starting to get paid for that work when the majority aren't, it just seems wrong. Like I said, supporting people on Patreon is legal, but I don't think it's morally ok. There's also the supply and demand thing.

For example, I've followed the artist Sakimichan for a long time. When she started doing Patreon work, most of her at just became sexualized poses of famous characters. If that's what she wants to do, that's great. But her work used to be so interesting! Here is before the Patreon:

While she did fanart, a lot of her work was original or had an interesting spin to it. She mixed up styles, experimented with landscapes and generally seemed to try new things. But once she got a Patreon, a lot of people like the new stuff. So that's mainly what she does now. She draws a video game character and then creates an NSFW version with it. f you want to actually see the blurred out parts, you have to pay for it through Patreon. She also offers these weird drawing tutorial things, and I personally think they're useless, but I'm sure there are people who appreciate them. Examples of her new art:

It's awesome that she can make the insane amount of money she makes by doing what she does, but like I said, it just seems wrong. Not to mention that I've grown tired of seeing constant NSFW versions of everything she does. While her art is still beautiful, it's just not the same. The style has changed and it's somehow messier looking, in my opinion.

And I think this is what would happen to most authors if they were paid for fanfiction. They would be paid to do a short sexy or fluffy scene between two characters, and while they're still a talented author, it wouldn't be the same.

*** Thanks for sharing this, as that is some rather stunning artwork. You brought up an interesting point to me in that while I dislike the concept of accepting money for fan fiction, I see no issues with doing it for art. Really, is there that much of a difference between an artist drawing a famous person/cartoon/character/anime and someone writing a story involving them? I suppose not, yet I feel differently about whether one is acceptable to pay for or not.

*** I think it's important to make the following distinction:

1. Being paid to write fanfiction. An exchange is taking place. The relationship is essentially that of a sale. If the seller doesn't deliver then technically they could be sued for breach of contract.

2. Being financially supported by patrons. This is not an exchange because it's a one-way relationship. The patron gives money, but the patronised person doesn't give anything back in exchange. They simply carry on with whatever creative endeavours they were doing before and are free to follow their muse, whether that be fanfic, original fiction, or whatever. Vitally, the patronised person has no obligations towards their patrons.

I would posit that the first is immoral whereas the latter is not.

***** Except they aren't. Being financial supported in general is not the same thing as being given money to write fanfiction.

Let's imagine I was a musician who wrote fanfiction in my spare time. I have a patron who likes my music and supports me financially. But for that support, I would have to get a second job in addition to my music, and I wouldn't be able to write fanfiction. Therefore but for the patron, I would not be writing fanfiction. The patron's financial support has caused me to write fanfiction. And yet what is happening is not an exchange. The patron might not even know about the fanfiction, and certainly they have no control over it.

What this thought experiment demonstrates is that causation is not a sufficient test for exchange. Your actions and financial support can cause someone to write without having exchanged with them.

With the principle demonstrated, we can then apply it to the case of "pure fanfiction". A patron supports a fanfiction writer financially. Their financial support enables the writer to spend their time writing, so they have caused the writing of fanfiction. But as we just said, causation doesn't amount to exchange. If you want to say that an exchange has taken place you need more than merely causing a person to write.

If you think this through several examples, it seems like common sense. Imagine, for example, a parent paying their teenage child who writes fanfiction pocket money. The pocket money is a kind of stipend, exactly like patronage. Has the parent paid for their kid to write fanfiction? To say "yes" seems absurd. Again, the parent may not even know the fanfiction exists.

I think we need to avoid adopting a principle which says people who write fanfiction can never be the recipient of gifts.

******* You really don't see the difference between someone PM'ing me and saying "dude, I have to read the next chapter of your fic. I'll give you $100 if you update in a week" vs. someone saying, "we had a great conversation in a coffee shop, and I'm a whimsical millionaire. I think it would be cool if you had more free time to be creative. Here's $2500 a month so you don't have to work two jobs. Go nuts!"

Because one is someone directly paying me to write fanfiction, and another is just a guy supporting me in general. I think Taure's point is that if I choose to write fanfiction in my newfound free time, that's not the same as being paid for it.

** I don't know of anyone, but it does lead to an interesting ethical conundrum.

Suppose that we take it as a premise that it's unethical to profit from writing fanfic. (I disagree, myself: as far as I am concerned, the main ethical difference between an "original" writer and a fanfic writer is that the latter tend to be more honest about where they get their ideas. But, let's suppose that it is.)

Now, suppose that a fanfic writer with an established reputation sets up a Pateron account and makes the following pitch: that he or she will keep writing anyway, but any donations are going to give him or her more free time (due to having to work for fewer hours in their day job, or be able to hire help), so more fic writing will certainly get done. How much and what fic will be written, the writer will not specify, asking the donors to trust him or her based on past record and the fact that he or she has already given away a lot of material for free and will continue to do so. Is that unethical?

To take it further, suppose that the Pateron campaign is sufficiently successful that the writer can quit their day job and is effectively writing fanfic full-time, but, again, there is no explicit agreement about what fanfic would be written or even how much. What about then?

** I've supported original artists on Patreon, but I don't think I'd ever support someone who just did fanworks - I don't have a moral issue with it, but I feel the benefit of patreon is you're supporting someone to grow?

In supporting some musicians, for example, I feel like I'm investing in their creative growth by giving them more time to work. Fanfiction is totally a way to grow creatively, but it won't build any further career in the same way.

** okay, so here's why I started a patreon.

I do fanfiction, yes.

I also do original stuff. I have some erotica almost ready to go, a cyberpunk novella in the middle of a rewrite, a completed script for a YA storybook, a pretty good idea for a fandom review website that I'm refining and hoping to pitch someday soon, a ‘zine that looks like it could have some interest, an outline to a nine novella series that needs some research material, and more.

I also work. 24-7. Literally. Because I'm a caregiver to a grandparent with Dementia. For no pay. Who hallucinates her three decade dead father built us a house and thinks we're going to move very soon. It's incredibly stressful, depressing, and painful to watch her mind slide.

That means I can't afford to buy new clothes(I have three shirts and two pairs of pants, only one of which I can wear outside). I am using a six year old laptop that spends more time with a rainbow beach ball than I spend writing it feels like. I can write on my iPad. But I can't make a book cover on it. I have two pairs of shoes. One pair has a hole in the sole and two inch plus long tears along the instep. The other pair is a pair of very heavy duty boots, not very comfortable in the summer. That means I can't afford to pay another person to create the book covers for me because some new bill always crops up every time I think I'm clear. I eat a cup noodle every other day, veggies and a handful of rice most days. My grandmother eats much better.

And worst of all, in January, my brother decided to steal my grandmother's debit card. And spent over a thousand dollars. We couldn't make rent or pay any bills that month for the most part until i borrowed heavily. We're behind in most utilities and paying an extra hundred a month for rent because of paying January in installments.

So, yeah, that's why I started a patreon.
