It is my global UN-ICW Alliance war fic. Where the Alliance fights against a devastating threat, one which prompts even the most radical Death Eaters to work with the new Wizard-Muggle alliance. But I just CANT think of what kind of atrocities would prompt them to join together. I mean, the nation is supposed to be far, far worse than Voldemort. But I just can't think of what I can have them do that would prompt them to join together.

Any ideas?

*** No, I want this to be a group fo brutally evil humans, who hate both muggles and wizards. I need them to be so evil, even the Death Eaters weep blood when they see what they do. Tall order, but do you have any thoughts?

****** May I suggest the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thule_Society][Thule Society]] as it ticks the required boxes.\\
It's got a (mild) link to the Nazis (and thus possibly Grindlewald), has been /officially/ disbanded since 1925 (who knows what they got up to after going underground...) and are /public domain/ bad guys, so are available to use.

**** I don't think it's possible for a group of humans to hate all other humans. Maybe they're super unethical, experimenting on children, creating science based mind controlled slaves/weapons, and they do it to both muggles and magicals, which sends the Death Eaters into a frenzy.

But also, aliens. Sure it's been done before, but that's because it works.
