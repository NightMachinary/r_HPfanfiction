does anyone know about any lengthy fanfics where harry becomes friends with the shard of Tom Riddle/Voldemort's soul that's inside of him ? preferably this happens when he's quite young, but i'm not super picky cause i know there's only so many fanfics like this. any suggestions would be much appreciated ðŸ˜Š

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.
