Hey guys I was wondering if anyone knows of a fanfic that has a Harry/Ginny pairing where Harry's mother Lily is alive. I know that's a bit oddly specific but any help whatsoever would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!


** Are you just looking for any fic that fits that, or a specific one? Because linkffn(The Darkness Within) has those two things, but also a bunch of other stuff.

  What if Wormtail hadn't told Lord Voldemort the Potters hideout. What if he took Harry straight to him instead? A Dark Harry fanfic. AU Mild HG
