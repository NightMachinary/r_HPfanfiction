** Hey! You might like the longfic I'm currently co-writing. No bashing of anyone (including Weasleys), a grey Dumbledore, and our genre is primarily Gen Angst/Whump. Lots of themes about blood politics, morality in wartime, and trust & deception. We take a long time to update, but it's a labor of love.

If that sounds like your cuppa, you can find it on ao3 or ffn: linkao3(A Lamb Before the Slaughter)

  Terror and destruction seemed inevitable after Voldemort finally revealed himself to the Wizarding World but, at Hogwarts, Harry lives a disturbingly unchanged life. He exists in parallel to the people around him and, as time passes, the line between friend and foe stretches into a complex gradient, difficult to decipher. Seeking desperately to become the hero the Order needs, it becomes more and more clear to him how dangerous that prospect is.But, in a life fraught with crisis and tragedy, what's just a little more?

  Hermione grows up as a maths whiz instead of a bookworm and tests into Arithmancy in her first year. With the help of her friends and Professor Vector, she puts her superhuman spellcrafting skills to good use in the fight against Voldemort. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.
