Just got introduced to HP fanfiction. My top 3:

1. On the way to Greatness- Mira Mirth
2. A Black Comedy- nonjon
3. Harry Potter and the Boy who lived- The Santi


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/The-Changeling][The Changeling by Annerb]] - It's recommended a lot here, and for good reasons. While events do follow canon, it avoids being a canon-rehash by focusing entirely on Ginny, and what it means to be in Slytherin. Incredibly well written for fanfiction. Currently incomplete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11815544/1/The-Aurors][The Aurors by FloreatCastellum]] - Unique in that it is a post-Hogwarts fic with an engaging plot. It has probably the most convincing take on what post-war life is like for Harry and Ginny. The OC is a pretty interesting character too. Well written, complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8202739/1/Weasley-Girl][Weasley Girl by Hyaroo]] - A rare fem!Ron (who isn't just genderbent to be a love interest). Does a great job of capturing the whimsy and playfulness of the first few books, without rehashing canon. The story covers their first year at Hogwarts, and the sequel covering the second year is in progress.

** linkffn(11191235) Prince of Slytherin: a gasp! well written fic that takes all tropes from the WBWL genre and flips them unpside down. linkffn(3384712) A great fic for me - I like harry/fleur, and this is a good one that also isn't super long. Plus, there's a lot of development for characters like Oliver Wood & Katie Bell linkffn(2740505) This is a perfect example of how I like my AU universes. Different, maybe more thought out, and well written.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Linkffn(12232484) I love her writing. All of her stuff is pretty fantastic but I really love this one. WIP.

Linkffn(To Live Nobly by cgner) Not very long but pretty fantastic. Stuck with me. One-shot.

Linkffn(The Life and Times by Jewels5) Incomplete. But it was an amazing journey for me. The first real fanfiction I read. That's probably why it's one of my favorites, actually.

Honorable Mentions:

Linkffn(Divergence by abovetheserpentine) I don't know why I like it so much. Complete.

There is this one called Brighter than Sunshine by hgfan1111. It's on a website called "ultimate Harry Potter fanfiction." I really loved this one. I'll edit with a link if you want to read it. I don't know if it's on FFN or something. I don't even remember how I found it.

But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it.

It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

** Backwards with Purpose: Always and Always. I do not think I will ever read a fanfic as good as it. It plays with your emotions like very, very, few other stories I've ever read. Frankly, I think it's better than the original series. linkffn(Backwards with Purposes - Always and Always)

Next has to be Hogwarts Houses Divided. It's basically the inspiration for the fanfic I'm writing now - though of course, with my current schedule and motivation, it'll never be completed. All that aside, I think it's a shining example of great writing and great characterization. linkffn(Hogwarts Houses Divided)

Third probably is the Naked Quidditch Match. Because it's funny as /fuck/, honestly. I couldn't stop laughing throughout that fanfic. And since we're on the topic, shout-out to Harry Potter and the Most Electrifying Man. linkffn(The Original Naked Quidditch Match) linkffn(Harry Potter and the Most Electrifying Man)

** Prince of the Dark Kingdom linkffn(3766574) by Mizuni-sama, at 1.2 million words its among the longest of HP Fanfics, and while it does have a bit of a rough start for the first 4-ish chapters, it is my favorite AU fic by far and has an awesome exploration and expansion of Voldemort's character.

Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin linkffn(11191235) by The Sinister Man is a WBWL story which reads like a fanfiction by a long time HP Fanfic fan. It takes a lot of the more prevalent cliches in the HP Fandom and either deconstructs or explores them well enough to make for a fairly enthralling story.

The Alexandra Quick series, starting with Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle linkffn(3964606) by Inverarity is a story which takes place in America after the Harry Potter canon storyline. Except for existing in the same universe and a couple of references to Britain the Alexandra Quick series is pretty much completely original. It makes for a very nice change of pace after reading a lot of fanfiction, while still providing an enticing story with elements from the Potterverse we all know and love.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Part One of Seven. Draco Malfoy: ex-Death Eater, former bigot, widower and single father. His children worship the Weasleys who clash with the decor, something is rotten at Hogwarts, and he doesn't really know what he's doing. But maybe he's getting the hang of it.
