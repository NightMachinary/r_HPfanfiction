Be it things that were changed, casting choices you think were unfortunate or things you think they screwed up, what are your biggest problems with the movies?

I feel the need to add that I do like them.


** Prisoner of Azkaban starts ridiculously, and gets worse. Like, the first scene has Harry using magic to read at night, which in a previous move it's stated that he's not allowed to. Perhaps most egregiously is that the Marauders are never explained, Lupin's connection to James is never really expanded beyond (I knew your father) and IIRC they never connect Sirius's animagus ability to being how he escaped from Azkaban.

If you're asking for color, you must've been really ask for it in Deathly Hallows Parts 1 and 2, with those dual films having no existence of it in either one. David Yates started off promising in Order of the Phoenix (ala Dumbledore vs. Voldemort duel in the Ministry of Magic), yet his color palate deflated considerably with the next three films. By the time Deathly Hallows Part 2 rolled around, I could've sworn Yates had never seen a rainbow.

Prisoner of Azkaban is, in my opinion, the best Potter film despite its inconsistencies and book differences. I hated Goblet of Fire, that atrocity of a film is just ridiculous. And Deathly Hallows Part 1 isn't that far behind.

****** John Williams...how he could've changed the outcome of Deathly Hallows Parts 1 and 2. Actually, the Harry Potter team contacted him to score the final two movies but he wanted to see a "rough cut" of the films in which they were unable to make in the time he had given them. Still, the possibilities of what he could've done...well, we can all dream about it, can't we?

***** Dementors /glide/ over the ground like the world's ghouliest ice skaters. They do not rise aboveground. When they "attacked" Harry as he played Quidditch, they just glided onto the pitch, and their aura was wide enough to affect Harry overhead. Note how a bunch of Slytherins wearing black robes had been a convincing Dementor disguise earlier.

*** Yeah, if you haven't read the books the movies don't make a whole lot of sense, which is a flaw for them standing the test of time and even working as a series.

They should at least have been able to flow if you'd seen the previous one instead of each one being a soft reboot of the one before.

** VOLDEMORT DISSOLVING AT THE END OF DEATHLY HALLOWS

Christ almighty, way to completely miss the core story of your entire series and character arc. The whole point is that he /isn't/ a monster, he isn't a fantasy, he isn't even a pureblood and fully a magical creature, he's just a man.

Other big issues for me are, although the actors bring something good to the characters, the casting of Snape, Sirius, Lupin, Pettigrew, and Harry's parents. The whole point is that these were bright young prodigy characters cut down in their prime, that's the great tragedy, /especially/ given that magical folk have greater longevity. Actors in their 40s and up portraying those characters kills that stone dead. I also feel Bonnie Wright was badly cast for Ginny and would even have recast her for OOTP on if necessary; a casting like Lindsay Lohan in The Parent Trap would have suited much better for young Ginny and would have evolved, instead of casting a girl who was going to look eternally timid.

Other little things would be shifting most of Ron's good lines to Hermione, sidelining Fleur and Krum in GOF as well as gendering their schools and making them ineffective, and cutting out the World Cup in a visual medium where it was established Quidditch was a major draw for audiences.

*** - I believe Voldemort's dissolving had a justification, both symbolically and in-universe: his body falls apart without a soul to hold it together because it was just an artificial construct from 1994, not a real living body. This misses the "just a man" point but stresses the "unnaturally clinging to life" part. Point is, I'd rather they'd have stuck to the book, but it's not as absurd and bizarre as some make it out to be.

- Though you make a compelling argument, I don't think "tragically cut down in their prime" was originally an element of the tragedy of James and Lily. As I recall, Rowling 'thought' of them as in their 30's or so, but as she is wont to do when it comes to maths, she kind of didn't think her timeline through, and they all "ended up too young". So while not book-accurate, again, it's not a betrayal of the /point/ of the characters as Rowling saw them.

That would still qualify as "tragically cut down in their prime". In particular as they are a Witch and a Wizard. It's only slightly more tragic that they were even younger.

** I don't really like the direction in a lot of the later movies, but that's not an adaptation problem. Adaptation problems do include:

- Inconsistent spell motions. Flourishes, swishes, flicks, please; it's not a sonic screwdriver you're handling.

- Rickman's Snape. I actually thinks he looks and sounds alright, aside from the age thing, but he plays it completely unlike how I saw Snape. I feel like Snape should be grandiloquent and dramatic, not stoic to the point of comedy.

- I'd rather have some four-legged dragons, thank you.

- Why cut Walburga Black's Portrait? Why cut Kreacher? By God we needed some comic relief in those movies.

- The "communication mirror" plotline in the last films is a confusing burnt-out husk of its book self. If you're not going to explain it properly, then folks, just cut it.

- Nagini should be green and fanged and bizarre, not some sort of unassuming-looking python.

- Why deny Grindelwald (and Pettigrew) their redemptions?

*** Yes Snape was always a much more emotional and overly-sensitive person in the books than in the movies! He was really petty and vindictive and he relished in it all the time. He also flew off the handle a lot at small stuff. I like over-emotional super-sensitive book Snape than stoic movie Snape who talks slowly and stuff.

** Casting: The casting of the trio is amazing. Particularly Rupert Grint... I can't fathom how much Ron would be hated (considering how badly he was written) if Rupert hadn't been as good of a Ron as he was. The rest of the cast is very hit and miss: Mostly way too old and I truly believe Bonnie Wright was a terrible cast for the role of Ginny. It feels like they only cast her for her looks. Gambon had his moments put [[https://i.imgur.com/kTXzCHo.jpg]["DID YOU PUT YOUR NAME IN THE GOBLET?!"]] was just terrible, but may have been the director's fault.

I don't like how they gave Hermione a pink dress. A lot else has already been mentioned in this thread and I don't want to repeat.

** cutting out all of SPEW and erasing Hermione's passion for house elves, muggles, working in the ministry-- one thing I always admired about Hermione is that she was an activist. I definitely think they made Ginny a lot less interesting and spunky and more into kind of a shy girl next door type which is corny. I also just think in general that the movies dont have the same whimsical, lighthearted and funky world building as the books, at least consistently. they feel too doom-and-gloom whereas the books continuously introduce colorful and quirky characters to add humor even in dark moments. dumbledore is far too serious in the films as well to state the obv

Five minutes prior: young Lily has big round brown eyes, whereas Harry's are greyish blue and more squinty.

I mean, I knew Snape was an ass, but for the movies he's full-on delusional -- so is Dumbledore for that matter, because he says the same thing to Snape.

(It's bad enough that they didn't get the color right; at least the adult Lily has eyes similar to Dan Radcliffe's, but in both cases I find them unremarkable.)

** There are a lot of criticisms that are artistic choices or bad casting or directing, but I have three big, plot-level problems with the films. Two are deleted scenes that should absolutely not have been deleted, and the third is a loose plot thread that really needed a satisfying resolution.

- In /Chamber of Secrets/, the deleted scene in the Hospital Wing where Ron explains about Tom Riddle's award and his possible connection with the Chamber. Without that scene, it makes no sense for Harry to ask the diary about the Chamber.
- In /Deathly Hallows/, the deleted scene where Ron (again) explains about the Taboo. Without that scene, it's impossible to understand what's going on when Xeno Lovegood says Voldemort's name, and the Death Eaters attack.
- In /Order of the Phoenix/, when Harry learns that Cho was given Veritaserum and thus did not willingly betray the D.A. to Umbridge, he never resolves the matter with her and never speaks to her again, leaving her thinking he still hates her. Canon!Harry would have definitely apologized to her in that situation, even if they didn't get back together.
