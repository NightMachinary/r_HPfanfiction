The Bond is forged, when Narcissa lied Voldemort about Harry being dead. But the consequences emerge years later. I thought that Harry at some Point meet Narcissa again and notices how attractive she is. He might attempt to get to know her, but she might be rejecting to his actions.

Whether her Persona after the War changes or The Bond makes her a little more kinder doesnt matter, maybe its both. She would reluctantly open to him, but still not like the idea about a Woman like her with a younger man....atleast thats how i imagined it.

If they get more intim with each other, i thought about she being the dominant type and teases him.

I thought about the Bond as the same that Harry forged with Wormtail, when he spared him.

However, i leave it to the Fic, if Harrys affection is permanent or temporal, same as on Narcissa.

I dont really see it as Harry/Narcissa, atleast not as a "bonded for life" thing.

The "One-sided" in the title refers to Narcissa totally rejecting harry, while he is on some kind of "lovepotion trip", but not as exaggerated as descripted in Canon. During the Fic, both of them would find each other, but she is the one, that still has doubts, if that what they try will succeed.

The Bond will make Harry getting attracted to Narcissa, but where it ends....i wouldnt know, but i would like, if it fades after they possible get intim with each other.


** Sounds interesting but probably someone wrote such a fic b4 idk why but it seems (no offence) like a generic idea, i mean pretty common troupe. But if someone finds it or writes it i wanna read it :)
