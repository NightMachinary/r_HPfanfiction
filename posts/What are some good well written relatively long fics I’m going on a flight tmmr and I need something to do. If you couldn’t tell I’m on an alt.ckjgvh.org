** Tales From Durmstrang: Poisoned Bloodlines

A fic I'm currently writing about Durmstrang starring mainly Nordic characters, although many from the canon (Grindelwald, Krum, Newt, Draco) appears.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13217021/1/Tales-From-Durmstrang-Poisoned-Bloodlines]]

”The tale about a young half-blood who's about to attend his last year at the Durmstrang Institute, where he gets caught in a rebellion by the institute's half-breeds lead by his former best friend, who seeks to end the pureblood student hierarchy once and for all. What follows is an intense year of drama, violence, tension, wild partying, and the quest of finding oneself.”

** I'd like to think mine is well written, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18874543/chapters/44800099]] It's Snape-centric, still in progress but almost done

Also recommend the series Memories and dreams by paganaidd which is like a full length novel

And "the mapmakers" (its on ao3)

#+begin_quote
  COMPLETE. When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost. It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything. (A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)
