Harry didn't have his mother's eyes. Her eyes were warm and inviting, Harry's eyes were pale, cold. Deathly.

When Voldemort cast the curse that rebounded and seemingly destroyed the Dark Lord, some infinitesimal amount of its magic was caught in Harry's body, showing itself in his eyes - and, to the consternation of the Wizarding World, growing to the point where his gaze would turn more lethal than a Basilisk's in the case of any accidental magic weakening whatever magic held it back.

Only the intervention of Albus Dumbledore, both in a political and a magical sense, prevents the Wizengamot from labeling Harry a dangerous magical creature and handing him over to a disturbingly eager Walden MacNair. His most recent interventions, a magically-reinforced blindfold and placement with the Weasleys, have luckily born fruit.\\
The Weasleys had immediately taken to the boy, which in combination with the emergency blindfold has resulted in almost four years of no incidents - besides Percival Weasley's pet rat, which had bitten the boy and narrowly escaped instant death for it, at the cost of revealing himself to be a very alive Peter Pettigrew. While no deaths had occurred this time, it had meant long and arduous days in the courtroom answering questions and seeing to the freedom and recovery of one Sirius Black.

*** Plot twist: Both survive because the magic in Harry's eyes is so similar to a Basilisk's gaze that they cancel each other out lethality-wise. Basilisks judge their mate by the strength of their magical gaze, and Harry has the strongest gaze the Basilisk has ever seen (which, to be fair, isn't hard given it had never seen another basilisk before).

Harry gains a fanon-Ginny level stalker who also happens to be a sixty-plus foot, thousand year old snake.

This is how Hogwarts/Giant Squid type crack-pairings are born.

***** Not particularly.

My theory -

A camera actually reflects the light multiple times, and what Colin saw was a reflection. Harry, on the other hand wears glasses which are transparent and most likely wouldn't stop the magical powers of the gaze. We know that the light gets reflected but the magical power doesn't (probably) and that while the light reflects on the mirror, the magical energy passes through or is absorbed like any other inanimate object.

****** Depends on the camera. Many old-timey cameras had viewfinders without mirrors, especially if they had to be cheap and/or compact (because the mirrors add to the price and the bulk) it was just a little window at the top of the camera.

In the movies and the games it looks like one of those models.

******** Meh, I mostly just want it to work because fanfiction and we already have Cyclops-Harry shooting Killing Curses out his eyes by accident :-P.

Honestly I have no idea what'd actually happen. Myrtle had been crying when she died, and I know from experience that kids who wear glasses will push them out of the way to rub at their eyes when they cry so I'm assuming that's what happened there - but if she didn't, that invalidates this entire argument.

Unless of course Harry's glasses are in turn magic (I mean, he shoots Killing Curses out his eyes - makes sense for his glasses to be charmed to stop that effect), in which case I'd rule that neither Harry nor the Basilisk would die as the effects are so similar the glasses would deal with both.

****** Not every petrification was by reflection - Justin Finch-Fletchley was petrified after seeing it through the translucent Sir Nicholas. It could then be argued the the magic part was partially absorbed by the ghost, but it's simpler to say that direct eye contact kills and anything else is less lethal. After all, basilisks were first bred in times long before glasses were invented, let alone easily produced, so they were still incredibly lethal when they were invented.

****** Yeah, it should fall squarely under "children's literature, don't think too hard or it won't make sense anymore". But then those are usually the most fun discussions to have.

Also I doubt most parents would give anything but a relatively cheap and simple, "the viewfinder is basically just a magnifying glass somewhere at the top with no mirrors anywhere" type camera to an excitable 11 year old - so it's probably about the same protection wise.

****** No, she has glasses in the book - but she was also crying before she died, which means her glasses were most likely not covering her eyes at the time (you tend to rub at your eyes to wipe away tears while crying, and that means pushing your glasses out of the way if you have them).

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.
