I was watching a video and someone said that they met a Dolores Umbridge with a Karen haircut and now I can't get that image out of my head.


** Umbridge is a lot worse than a Karen. She is a combo of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Freisler][Roland Freisler]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Eichmann][Adolf Eichmann]].

I see strong analogy between Wizarding Britain in DH and Occupied Europe under the Third Reich:

Voldemort = Hitler

Lucius Malfoy = [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Hess][Rudolf Hess]], Hitler's close associate, fell out of favor later

Yaxley = [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Himmler][Heinrich Himmler]]

Pius Thickenesse = Some non-Nazi career politician without power, like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_von_Papen][Franz von Papen]]

Death Eaters = [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutzstaffel][SS]]

Aurors = [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestapo][Gestapo]]

Snatchers = [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einsatzgruppen][Einsatzgruppen]]

Muggleborns, Muggles = Jews, Slavs, and any other group deemed as Subhumans by the Nazis

Azkaban = Auschwitz

Pureblood Supremacists = Nazis

Hogwarts Resistance = French (or other country's) Resistance

--------------

This year's August 1st was the 76th anniversary of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Uprising][Warsaw Uprising]]. Fortunately, the Battle of Hogwarts (or the Uprising at Hogwarts) had a much better outcome.

***** Oh, thanks for the confirmation. Although, I understand why certain fics would have written this, fits with the Nazi Vichy aesthetic.

** I wouldn't say that, no. Narcissa Malfoy is much more of a "Karen" than Umbridge is. For Narcissa---just as for a "Karen"---the world revolves (or ought to revolve) around herself and her family, and no one else matters.

Umbridge, on the other hand, actually has values (evil ones), a vision for society greater than herself (an evil one), loyalty to people who are not her family (e.g., Fudge), and causes for which she is prepared to get her own hands dirty.

In fact, now that I think about it, Umbridge is, more than anything, the Evil!Hermione.

*** I came here to say that Draco is the Karen of the franchise. It's not a big stretch from "my father will hear about this" to "Iet me speak to a manager"

**** That's a good point! I didn't think to ask if any male characters fit the archetype; perhaps that was sexist of me.

*** Hermione is however a lot more intelligent and powerful than Umbridge. An evil Hermione is quite a terrifying prospect...
