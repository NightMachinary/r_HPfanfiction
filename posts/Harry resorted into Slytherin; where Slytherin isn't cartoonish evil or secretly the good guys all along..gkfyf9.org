So, I just read a fic that had a really interesting concept. The ministry implements a mandatory resorting after 4th year. Harry, of course is resorted into slytherin. That was where the good stopped. I was expecting the Slytherins to be even remotely connected to canon. But no.

So...is there any other stories with that consept; where the Slytherin students do not act like Hufflepuffs? They can not be die hard Voldemort fans, but just not be bland?


** This one is great. The Slytherins are mostly decent people, but they're not perfect. They still bully people and they tend to only look out for themselves.

  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn. Then he gets the bad news: he's been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.

** I think this is one of the best examples of Slytherins being mostly normal children at a boarding school. Serpensortia trilogy by MzMinola. Harry is sorted into Slytherin from the beginning, rather than a resorting.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Albus Dumbledore was sure he made the right choice when he sacrificed an innocent child. Too late he understood how terrible that mistake was. Harry Potter was not what he wanted him to be, he was not what the magical world expected him to be. He was not a replica of James. Instead, he inherited more of Lily... Far too much to be convenient.
