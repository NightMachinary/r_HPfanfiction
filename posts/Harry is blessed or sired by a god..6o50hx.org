The most popular one being hecate, but i'm fine with any god as long as the story is complete. Even if it is part of a series, the series has to be complete as well or getting updated more than twice a month. Also i don't mind if there is a crossover with another story like Percy Jackson or Naruto etc... as long as it meets the above conditions, otherwise i look forward to your suggestions.


** Linkffn(the triumph of these tired eyes) It is a Thor crossover with Loki as Harry's father, the only good one of the type in my opinion. And it's complete!

  In his several millennia of existence Loki Odinson, God of Mischief and Lies, had been many things; he had been a liar, a warrior, and a trickster, just to name a few, but never before had he been a loving father, he'd never been given the chance. However, the moment the tiny creature was in his arms, he knew he would do anything necessary to keep hold of what was his.

*** *Tyche*

Tyche (English: ; from Greek: Τύχη, meaning "luck"; Roman equivalent: Fortuna) was the presiding tutelary deity that governed the fortune and prosperity of a city, its destiny. She is the daughter of Aphrodite and Zeus or Hermes.

In literature, she might be given various genealogies, as a daughter of Hermes and Aphrodite, or considered as one of the Oceanids, daughters of Oceanus and Tethys, or of Zeus. She was connected with Nemesis and Agathos Daimon ("good spirit").

** Later parts of The Lone Traveler Series have Harry interacting frequently on behalf of gods, including being blessed by a love god that grants him a golden patronus that can remove the Dark Mark from a person (Karkaroff), and eventually becoming God of Free Will. He also regularly has Pan-Galactic Gargle Blasters with the Boss.
