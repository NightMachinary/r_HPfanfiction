As the title says i'm looking for an agent harry with all the gadgets, suave ladys man, brilliant liar, intelecut and tuxedos that come with it. I've been on a james bond/sherlock binge for a bit so any sherlock like harry storys are welcome too. Anything to do with mystery crimes and harry is the guy they call is welcome.

  A "tragic" accident leaves young Harry in the care of a relative that nobody knew existed. It seems Lily Evans had an Uncle named Edmund Bond who had a son he called James.
