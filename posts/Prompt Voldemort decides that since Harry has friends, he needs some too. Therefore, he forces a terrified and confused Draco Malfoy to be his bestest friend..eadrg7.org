Many cracky hijinks ensue. Loosely inspired by this: [[https://youtu.be/tytOwMLqufg]]


** This actually happened in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185). Voldemort saw Harry making great strides, so he adopted a very different strategy and did rather well afterwards. But Draco Malfoy did not become his 'friend'.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

** Easier than Falling Asleep, linkffn(12868582)

â€‹

It was more of an accident than anything though. It wasn't Draco, it was Hermione. And she didn't know it was Voldemort either.

Also, I find it really freaking dumb that my spellcheck allows Voldemort, but not Hermione...

  Harry is struck with the killing curse and wakes up the day of the Last Task. This story will be the Order of The Phoenix if Harry had been a bit wiser and Luna a more present character. No time Paradox and no godmoding. Slow build up. Also, the tanslation in French is available by Eohwel.
