But yes, I made this for a side project and hopefully it will help book discussions around the community! I thought of Harry Potter when I reread the scene in Deathly Hallows where Harry sees Snape's memories. It hits hard every time.

Try searching "Uranus" ;)

If this doesn't work for anyone, please message me!


** Without actually searching it, Ron and Lavender during Astronomy at some point and DOM at least...

Edit: missed one scene where Harry and Ron talk about dropping divination. Cool site!!

** It's been fun to search the canon text to see how some fanfiction tropes compare to the original, eg:

- "Greater good" Dumbledore - turns out, all the occurrences of the phrase "greater good" are in DH, and are either directly related to Dumbledore's past w/ Grindelwald and not the present, or are Aberforth still being upset about said past
- Lemon drop addict Dumbledore - not true, Dumbledore appears to only once offer a lemon drop to someone. Other occurrences are when they are (or were) the password for his office.
- Harry my boy, my boy Harry, my boy, etc... - Said by Wood (after they win a Quidditch match), Trelawney, and Hagrid. Never Dumbledore. At least, never with the two words adjacent to each other like that.

** searched Dumbledore, Lemon Drops, and his eating or offering of them, were mentioned in the first book.

Ron mentioned "slimy gits" once, about Slytherins, in Goblet of Fire.

Those two tropes are seriously, overblown in fanfiction

Gred and Forge is mentioned once, in the books, and overblown in fanfictions.

Mudblood, is mentioned an awful lot, especially as the series gets more mature, but overall, I'd say that fanfiction also overblows the word, as well.

Didn't find the: "You can't be serious", "I am sirius" joke at all, in it. So that's just a fanfiction thing, in general.

Golden Trio, was also apparently not mentioned, at all.

Marauders Map, was mentioned, however, the "group" was mentioned by Ron, once. So I think the Marauders was meant for the map, and not the actual group. But people just decided to name them that.

** ~searches for 'Ron' and 'Slytherin'~\\

Hmm...nope, I didn't read every single entry but there wasn't one single instance of Ron whining about 'slimy Slytherins'. The worst was when he commented that he'd have taken the train straight back home if he were sorted into Slytherin, after learning about the Chamber of Secrets.

*** I totally agree. I searched for slimy. The only times Ron calls someone "slimy" in the whole series is when Malfoy and his family behaved like arrogant snobs at the Worldcup. And really - they deserved that. He doesn't once call Snape or the other Slytherins that while in fandom it seems Rons favorite swear word.

** I find it a bit concerning my antivirus software keeps going off whenever I try a search on the pottersearch . tech site.

It's a cool program but the whole computer virus thing kind of soured it for me.
