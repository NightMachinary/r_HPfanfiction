I suddenly got a desire to read some Harry Potter fics again and Fred/Hermione has been my favorite pairing for a long time. Does anyone know of some great F/Hr fics? I've probably read most of the older ones tbh, but would be happy to re-read some. Willing to give George/Hermione a try as well if it's a really great one.

No Muggle-AUs or other world-changing AU's please(like Hermione being a Slytherin).


** I guess you know Arithmancer series by White_Squirrel by heart, right?

*** I've heard of it, but never read it. I guess I should give it a go.

** Well, this one has a bit of time traveling so I don't know if you'd consider it too AU, but the writing and plot are both fantastic Linkao3(Falling Through Time)

*** I don't mind time traveling fics, as long as things aren't drastically different before the time traveling.

I actually starting reading this a couple of years ago but it wasn't completed so I ended up forgetting about it. I'm stoked to see that it is now complete, thanks for the suggestion!

** What's the canon/fanon differences between Fred and George anyway? I'm writing Fred as slightly more adventurous and George a little more cautious, with a few differences in which subjects they're better at but most of that is just made up.

*** That's kind of how I see them as well, but there really isn't much difference between them in the books. I've just always had a slight preference for Fred.
