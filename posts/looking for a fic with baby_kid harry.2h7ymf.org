Hi! I'd really like a fic where baby/kid harry traveled back in time during lily and james' time in hogwarts! it can be lily and james who traveled forward in time too! I'd just really like a fic with teen-aged james and lily awkwardly trying to take care of harry. :D thanks!

Lily/James/Harry with plenty of complication. Harry gets a little more than he bargained for when he looks into the Mirror of Erised. His desire for his parents might be so deep that he's fallen into a place in the past where his parents are alive and whole...and have no idea who he is. Mostly takes place Marauder's Era, but Harry's right in the thick of it.
