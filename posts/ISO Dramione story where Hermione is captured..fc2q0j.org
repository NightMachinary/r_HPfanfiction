:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a specific fanfic on FFdotnet that I remember reading and wanted to give a re-read (highly recommend it if you haven't already read it). It's a Dramione fic where Voldemort 'won' and Harry was in hiding, and Hermione was captured by Death Eaters some time ago, and locked up. Draco manages to stumble upon her, realizes that she could lead them to where Harry was, and tries to help her recover and gain her trust so he can wheedle the info out of her. She will only tell him fairy tales, hovever most of them are slightly modified to fit vaguely around the story of her and her friends throughout the war.

I won't spoil the end, but if someone remembers what it was called, I'd greatly appreciate it. I'm going to hunt through my library and history and see if I can find it. If I do, I'll post an update.

Thanks!
