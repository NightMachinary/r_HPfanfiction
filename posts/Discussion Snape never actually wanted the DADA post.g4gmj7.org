As in title^

In many fics, we see the trope of Snape badly wanting to be DADA professor and Dumbledore repeatedly turning him down. This is taken from a moment in canon when Ron says to Harry that Snape has always wanted the job. (correct me if I'm misremembering, which is possible)

But... this doesn't make sense. For the straightforward reason that the position is cursed s.t. anyone who takes it dies, is incapacitated, or is fired at the end of the year. There is no reason for Snape to want to risk death or grievous injury to spend one year teaching DADA. This is especially true because the one reason Harry speculated in canon (he actually wants to teach the dark arts bc he's evil) doesn't hold up once you know he's a spy.

But he might have reason to spread the rumor he wants the post (even if it is a bit unbelievable) -- good reason for him to resent Dumbledore, lends credence to his chops as a dark wizard.

That's why whenever I see a fic and Snape is in Dumbledore's office furious he wasn't given the DADA post once again, I roll my eyes a bit.

EDIT: After reading the comments, I'm now certain abt this. Thanks to [[/u/Vrajitoarea]]:

#+begin_quote
  It's not canon that he /wants/ it, it's canon that he applied for it, repeatedly. And in HBP it's revealed why - he and Dumbledore concocted a story that Dumbledore never fully trusted Snape, and that Snape had reason to resent Dumbledore (as [[https://www.reddit.com/u/HagofaSophia/][u/HagofaSophia]] has rightly pointed out in the OP), which would make it more believable to Voldemort that Snape never truly became Dumbledore's man.

  The quote from OotP that you posted actually proves this - the fact that Snape kept applying, despite knowing very well Dumbledore would reject him, makes no sense /unless/ you realise that Snape didn't expect his application to be accepted.

  The interview you posted precedes the last two books - /obviously/ JKR wouldn't have given away the real reason behind the whole DADA story, since it would have made Snape's true loyalties clear. Of course Dumbledore fully and completely trusted Snape.

  The fact that the first mention of Snape mentions his desire for the DADA post is... very clearly meant to be a giant red herring, and part of the reason Harry suspects him, and not Quirrell, throughout the first book.

  As for the other DADA teachers - Snape was asked by Dumbledore to keep an eye on Quirrell, his distaste for incompetent Lockhart makes perfect sense (and he's still civil towards him), his suspicions regarding Lupin hiding information about Sirius were actually true, his wariness of Moody is perfectly normal, and Umbridge was universally hated.

  The reason Snape took the post in Y6 was because he and Dumbledore knew that Dumbledore would be dead in less than a year, Snape would have to flee, and Hogwarts would fall to Voldemort. At which point, Dumbledore hoped, Snape would be named Headmaster, so the DADA position would become irrelevant.

** Snape may have been great at potions but what he loved was the Dark Arts - he invented spells, wrote about them in his potions book, and even twenty odd years later he was still proud of them. IIRC he went on fairly lovingly about the dark arts once he was able to teach defence. Defence is just the closest class he could get to dark arts

Almost all DA teachers we see are dead or really fucked up. Quirrel died, Lockhart essentially died, Crouch died, Umbridge raped by animals. I mean... 3/5 dead, 4/5 life-alteringly incapacitated, 5/5 with severe consequences.

He can experiment without teaching kids. In fact there's no evidence he'd enjoy teaching DA to kids even if he liked messing around with it himself. Also... to the extent of willing to die in 1 yr to have the privilege of teaching kids DA?

  “Well,” said Hermione, “I thought he sounded a bit like you.”

  “Like me?”

  “Yes, when you were telling us what it's like to face Voldemort. You said it wasn't just memorizing a bunch of spells, you said it was just you and your brains and your guts---well, wasn't that what Snape was saying? That it really comes down to being brave and quick-thinking?”
#+end_quote

At the same time that Snape was inventing such spells as a toenail-growing hex, he was also heavily modifying potions that were a year beyond his level. There's nothing to suggest he loved potion-making less than the dark arts.

Also, Snape didn't need an excuse to leave Hogwarts. The reason he didn't leave was because he was there to protect Harry, in the first place, and because it was crucial to his spying, once Voldemort returned. The reason he wasn't killed by Voldemort was because he supposedly had decades of spying on Dumbledore to serve up to Voldemort.

** Talk to any teacher who teaches two seperate subjects. Teaching takes preparation, for every hour in front of the class you need 1-2 hours of prep time. It is less for experienced teachers and it varies from subject to subject. Art hardly takes any preparation while a language class can be quite time intensive. Different subjects also vary in how draining they are on your mental reserves as a teacher.

The way I see Snape teaching he probably has the written prep work for potions down on file cards. Like 4th year, 5th lesson, blood replenishing draught. He then just copies the relevant text onto the blackboard with the flick of his wand. But he will still need to make sure that the relevant ingredients are in the store cupboard and that workstations are set up correctly. A fanfic that I read stated that he spends 20 min between each lessons to clean up and set up everything and I find this somewhat believable. Then the actual teaching. It is mentally extremely draining to keep 20+ teenagers under control while they are handling dangerous substances. There is fire and explosives and little shitheads who don't listen. He has to watch all of his students like a hawk to prevent accidents.

Do this for 8 hours every day 5 days a week and most people will end up completely burned out after a 3-5 years.

To me it makes total sense that Snape wants to get away from teaching potions and that sort of mental drain.

Compared to teaching potions teaching DADA might be a piece of cake. He has more control over what the students are doing, there aren't any things that might explode, he can turn around without constantly watching over his shoulder. Yes, he will be forced to do more prep work at least initially, but this might be a small price to pay for more peace of mind and less mental exhaustion at the end of the day.

  the least likely to cause harm to a student, in order from least likely to most likely, are Trelawny, Sprout, Flitwick, Hagrid, Firenze, McGonnogal, Slughorn, and Snape.
#+end_quote

In that order, here are the teachers harming students:

*Trelawney:*

1. predicts a death every year and distresses students with her predictions
2. To Hermione: “I don't remember ever meeting a student whose mind was so hopelessly mundane.”
3. takes her anger about Umbridge's performance review out on students: throws a book at Dean and Seamus, and thrusts another one so hard into Neville's chest that he falls. She then calls the entire class a bunch of idiots: “You know what to do! Or am I such a substandard teacher that you have never learned how to open a book?”

*Sprout:*

1. Has students working with a flesh-eating plant that punches them; Neville is working alone and he gets beaten up.
2. Acted distant toward Harry because he was named the 2nd Hogwarts Champion

*Flitwick:*

1. does not appear to do anything about Luna's bullying
2. has Seamus repeatedly write "I am a wizard, not a baboon brandishing a stick" because he overdoes it with Aguamenti. The Irish were once openly compared to apes in England in the past, so that's in extremely poor taste
3. Lavender bursts into tears during Charms, Flitwick doesn't notice

*Hagrid:*

1. gives Dudley a tail because Dudley's father insulted Dumbledore. Dudley has to get surgery to remove it
2. gets the Trio involved in his illegal and dangerous dragon hatching scheme, which results only in them being caught and punished, and in Ron being gravely injured
3. calls Draco an idiot
4. sends Harry and Ron into the forest to speak with Aragog
5. Draco gets injured in Hagrid's lesson
6. His blast-ended skrewts lesson result in multiple injured students
7. threatens Draco with transfiguration again after Moody's stunt
8. asks Harry and Hermione to secretly look after his incredibly dangerous brother
9. makes a fuss about the Trio dropping his subject and guilt-trips them about it

Not sure what you have against Firenze, but...

*McGonnogal:*

1.  forces Harry to become Seeker without asking him if he wants to, threatening him with punishment if he doesn't practice hard (in the process, ignores Draco's attempt to steal Neville's Rememberall)
2.  pulls 1st-year Draco by his ear in addition to assigning detention and docking 20 points
3.  sends 1st years to the Forbidden Forest to find a unicorn-slaying horror, in addition to docking 150 points from her own house, thus making Harry & Co. a target for hatred and discouraging Gryffindors from trying to win the House Cup
4.  Doesn't notice 1st-year Ginny's mental state
5.  Allows Ron to study with a broken wand
6.  catches Harry and Ron wandering the hallways alone, when teachers escort students everywhere, and lets them get away with it because Harry lies that they're going to see Hermione in the hospital wing; does not escort them
7.  locks Neville out of the common room with a mass murderer on the loose for having his passwords stolen, a humiliating and dangerous punishment for something that's not Neville's fault.
8.  Lets Harry practice Quidditch outdoors in POA despite the danger he is in bcz she wants the Quidditch Cup
9.  reacts to Moody torturing Draco by ordering Moody to take Draco to Snape to be punished some more, and doesn't check on him
10. humiliates Neville because she doesn't want to look bad in front of the foreign delegations
11. punishes Harry for losing his temper with Umbridge, proceeds to do the same thing in front of him
12. admits she treated Peter poorly because he wasn't as talented as his friends

*Slughorn:*

1. starts an elitist club to promote his faves and doesn't bother to learn Ron's name. This clearly affects Ron (Molly is still raw about Arthur being excluded from the Slug Club, years later - talk about emotional damage!)
2. Ron gets poisoned in front of him and he just stands there
3. was Tom Riddle's mentor and his influence on Tom is apparent in Tom trying to become a teacher to influence young minds, and testing poisons on house elves; he is openly prejudiced, though non-violent. Further, Slytherins were groomed into the DEs under his nose.

*and Snape,* according to you, the worst offender at the school, who insults students on a few occasions, takes a few points, and sets safe, sensible punishments.

A partial list of Snape protecting students:

*Snape:*

1.  runs into the Shrieking Shack to face Black and Lupin on the full moon to save the trio
2.  when the egg starts screaming in GOF, runs toward the screams alone in the middle of the night
3.  gives Umbridge fake Veritaserum
4.  Orders Harry to release Neville when he thinks Ron and Harry are fighting him
5.  Saves Neville from being choked by Crabbe
6.  Leaves an occlumency lesson because he hears someone screaming
7.  Vows to protect Draco, follows through
8.  Runs toward Myrtle's cries of a murder, not knowing who was hurt or how and what danger he might face
9.  Steers Hermione+Luna out of harm's way before shit goes down by telling them to go help Flitwick in HBP
10. After killing Dumbledore, stops Death Eaters from Cruciating Harry
11. He is the one Dumbledore assigned to keep students safe during DH. Within this, he Sent the silver trio to Hagrid as a form of "punishment" for trying to steal the sword.

Neville's story is very sad but Snape never belittles him for his parents' state, he "belittles" him for his incompetence. Criticizing students is his job. He doesn't single Harry out for being an orphan, either - if anything, everybody else is singling Harry out for being the BWL while Snape knows that Harry didn't do anything special, so he /doesn't/ single Harry. Also, in that first lesson, he calls everyone dunderheads, including the Slytherins, and criticizes everyone except Draco.

The teeth comment is in GOF:18. Go read it again.

You'd think Snape would never miss an opportunity to punish Harry, who attacked Draco, right? Wrong. He sends Goyle to the hospital wing, despite Goyle being in pretty bad shape. Why doesn't he punish Harry? Because at this point, in GOF, the Dark Mark is already growing darker and Voldemort is coming back. Snape will soon have to resume his spying role. He cannot act like he otherwise would have, which is to punish everyone, including the Death Eaters' children - he is downplaying the whole thing to avoid punishing anyone.

Did he absolutely /have to/ mock Hermione? No. Does he ever do that in any other context? No. It was an easy way to demonstrate his hatred of Harry and supposed disdain for Muggle-borns, when he needed to reinforce that image of himself.

So it's a blanket "all children are stupid" insult. He's not going to bother going out of his way to say "all you Gryffindors are morons/dunderheads" when in fact, all children are stupid, especially in the subtle art of making potions.

Despite sending Goyle to the Hospital Wing, he does no such thing for Hermione who was also hit with a curse from Draco. It was one of the other students that took her without Snape's say-so. Also in relation to Hermione: “That is the second time you have spoken out of turn, Miss Granger . . . Five more points from Gryffindor for being an insufferable know-it-all.”

********** For the record, your argument was "Snape CONSTANTLY insults ALL NON SLYTHERINS", and you've only managed to provide examples of him insulting 4 specific Gryffindors.

I asked you for very little to prove that extraordinary claim - one example of Snape insulting someone other than Harry, Ron, Hermione, or Neville - and you couldn't even do that.

You said Snape is singling Harry out because Harry is an orphan. That's ridiculous. Of course he's singling Harry out, his entire existence is dedicated to protecting Harry, you don't think he would be curious to know if Harry has maybe inherited his beloved Lily's love for potions, or talent, or...? But it's not because he's an orphan. Go complain about the other teachers, who fawn over Harry for being the BWL, and who fawn over Hermione to the point that nobody else can prove themselves, which is actually harmful to every other student.

And yes, a blanket "I think most of you are stupid" statement isn't very nurturing, I never accused Snape of being nurturing and pleasant, I said he's able to criticize Slytherins, and I've shown it.

Hermione ran off to the hospital wing by herself because unlike Goyle, she's smart enough to do so. She didn't even reach out to Snape herself, Ron called his attention to her. You're ignoring the fact that he had to be nasty to Harry and his muggle-born friend in front of the Death Eaters' children. By the way, McGonagall didn't send Draco to the hospital either after he was tortured by Moody, she sent him to Snape to be punished some more, and that's in GOF13, the teeth comment is in GOF18, so it's her who has set the precedent that students can be disfigured and then NOT be sent to get help immediately. Snape has multiple valid reasons to be upset with Hermione on top of that. That she gets away with a remark about (possibly) her teeth and being chastised in class indicates that he actually likes her, or at least respects her.

Hermione is NOT a blind follower of authority. She has zero respect for Trelawney. Indeed this might be based on the fact that McG, whom she respects more, has zero respect for Trel too, but it means Hermione is choosing who to respect based on her own values. She acknowledges that Hagrid is a poor teacher. She is the mastermind behind many of the Trio's rule-breaking capers. She might have more respect for authority than Harry or Ron, but that's saying very little. Do not flatten Hermione's character to make your case. As for her defending Snape:

Book 1 (she doesn't believe Snape would steal the stone), book 4 (the cave scene, you've mentioned this), book 5 (talks excitedly about Snape's lesson), book 6 (says Snape sounds like Harry when he talks about the dark arts).

Neville's boggart is meaningless, his fear of Snape is mild, there's nothing messed up about a poor student who is preoccupied with a teacher who criticizes him. He gets over it by picturing Snape in funny clothes. Compare this to him crying for hours because McG docked Gryffindor 150 points, and the "total disgrace" he was in because she locked him out. Harry also experiences lasting damage because of McG, as he still remembers his first punishment at the Forbidden Forest as "nightmarish" as of the end of his 6th year.

Lastly, you wrote that Harry is an oblivious idiot who forgets how Snape abused Harry just for looking like James. That is staggeringly ignorant and illogical, enough so that it will take multiple paragraphs to refute.

Harry is not more of an oblivious idiot as a middle aged man, and a fully qualified auror at that, who has already had time for the truth about Snape to sink in, than he was as a kid or a teenager. Through his kid self's eyes, we see Snape as unjustly hateful and as a guy who is likely to be tempted by the Dark Arts, then as a potential unreformed Death Eater who might actually be playing both sides or even trying to get Harry killed; Harry certainly accuses him for Sirius dying (which even he acknowledges is more due to his own bias than fact), and then of his parents' death (that, at least, is not groundless), and of course he sees him killing Dumbledore. As an adult, he was able to appreciate Snape's courage, /because/ he had complete information and he was *no longer* oblivious.

As an adult and a father, perhaps he could appreciate that being criticized and disciplined does not equate to being abused, even though children don't like it, whereas being neglected and then subjected to disproportionate punishments at random actually /is/ abusive (it's astonishing that McG could dock 150 points for breaking curfew, yet assign one detention for the flying car stunt, for example).

Finally, Snape indeed disliked Harry, and didn't see him for who he was, because of James. Considering that James traumatized him (and you said insults are traumatic, so you have no leg to stand on if you're gonna say insults+physical violence+sexual violence aren't traumatic), this isn't a choice to abuse a James clone just for shits and giggles - this is a trigger, and it's involuntary. Harry himself was traumatized for weeks just from seeing how his dad had treated Snape, and he still remembered this with sadness two years later.

There are other reasons why Snape dislikes Harry, that have nothing to do with him looking like James:

1. When they first make eye-contact, both of them are set on the wrong path because Quirrell is right there. Harry feels a pain when Snape is looking at him, and Snape, who /must/ be reading Harry, is actually reading Voldemort. Harry later sasses at him in the very first lesson, and nearly knocks him off his broom
2. In COS, Harry arrives at school by flying car, launches a seemingly random attack on Slytherins, and also turns out to be a Parselmouth, another quality associated with Voldemort
3. In POA, Harry displays recklessness truly worthy of his father
4. In GOF, Harry becomes, again, the center of attention. Snape resents this, but /so does Ron/
5. OOTP: Harry violates Snape's privacy and endangers him, Snape does not know that Harry regrets the whole thing
6. Worst of all, Snape catches Harry casting Sectumsempra on Draco and lying about where he had learned it. This is the ultimate confirmation that Harry is no better than his father and godfather, who had nearly killed /him/.

This is a partial list of times when Harry behaves like James - and everyone said James was the biggest troublemaker in Hogwarts history, so any teacher would have a problem with it. There are also multiple occasions, before legilimency is formally introduced, of Snape looking into Harry's eyes just as Harry is thinking how much he would like to hurt Snape, and that must be flashback inducing on top of affirming Snape's belief that Harry is James 2.

Snape has a disincentive to try with Harry: He knows he will return to Voldemort as a spy. The cover story is, “I thought Voldemort was finished, and that Harry did it.” Becoming best buds with Harry would have been inexplicable; becoming best buds with Harry and then NOT using that to deliver Harry to Voldemort on a silver platter (i.e., what Crouch Jr. has done) - unforgivable. Snape relied heavily on half-truths and misdirection but there was one thing he could be honest with Voldemort about: He hates Harry with a passion. /That/, ironically, helped him protect Harry.

FWIW, I believe that the inclusion of the memory of Snape ranting about Harry, and Dumbledore dismissing Snape and telling him he's wrong, is intended as an apology.

**** That is assuming that Snape associated the DADA post with certain death. Yes, it is cursed. But out of the 6 DADA teachers we know of only Quirrel died. Yes, Lockhart, Moody, Crouch and Umbridge had bad stuff happen to them. At the same time Moody, Lupin and Umbridge came out perfectly alright physically, ditto for Snape at the end of year 6.

We don't know what happened to the other DADA teachers who taught in the years between the day the position was cursed by Tom Riddle and the day Harry finished Voldemort for good, but from the above canon we can infer that the survival chances are quite good and that being the DADA teacher does not mean certain death.

Also, I actually had numbers for what we've seen - and the death rate is > 50%. I never claimed it was a death sentence before, but you have to admit saying that going from math teacher prep time to art teacher prep time is worth the chance of death is an outlandish claim. If Snape wanted to kill himself, he could've done it with his own wand, not by applying for a position he knew he wouldn't get.

Alternatively, the explanation that applying when he knew he wouldn't get it suits the ends we know him to have is not outlandish and is actually sensical/logical.

Basically, if JKR's interviews, her very first introduction of Snape in the books (literally the first mention of Snape in the books is that he wants Quirrell's job), and his actions throughout the series all point to Snape wanting the position of DADA, I think that's fairly emphatically the case.

For emphasis, for at least each of the 3 first books, virtually the first reference to Snape is that he wants the DADA position - at every feast it's repeatedly stated that it's common knowledge that that's the position he wants.

I don't really have an opinion or care overmuch as to what the answer to the original question is either way - given the majority of everything else Rowling has done, it was probably something crappily Doylist and contradictory that only works for the plot of the single book it was written in.

Really, there's enough room in canon for whatever interpretation you want to take of anything in it. So long as the position a fic telling a story involving that detail takes is good for that story, it doesn't really matter to me.

To give an example of the open-to-interpretation thing, you see the scene as Snape trying to get Remus kissed because he thinks he's in cahoots with Sirius, while I'd observe that Snape is very vitriolic and quite irrational in that scene - he phrases everything more like he's trying to get revenge due to his hatred of the Marauders than justice for Lily/to protect Harry. Also, that whole part where they stare at the door because it opened suddenly was apparently Snape sneaking in with the cloak and the time-travelled Harry and Hermione see him running in barely a minute or two after they (the pre-timetravel version of them) first enter the tunnel to the shack, so he hears enough of the conversation to get the idea that Remus isn't in cahoots at all, he's just in enough denial and hatred to not really care and then lie about what he heard later to Fudge. Both of us could be right, both of us could be wrong - there's enough detail to support either interpretation and enough detail to contradict.

So, yeah. You could be right in that he didn't want the job and was just faking it for some reason, while Matpack could be right in that Umbridge's directly stated quote was accurate.

It's the complete opposite of that - it's an overarching story with a Watsonian explanation that makes perfect sense. Snape and Dumbledore wanted to sell the idea that Snape was never truly reformed, and that Dumbledore never fully trusted him.

It only becomes contradictory and dumb when someone is so keen on hating Snape, they ignore the fact Snape practically spells out the explanation, in "Spinner's End", for even the slowest of wits. Which is how they end up with "Snape was so desperate to curse children/get out of his job/[other idiotic reason], and cared about nothing else, that he was willing to die after one year of doing it!"

Does he? It's Lupin and Sirius who keep referring to the "schoolboy grudge" (which is in itself grossly reductive), and Sirius is the one who is weirdly and obsessively vitriolic towards a guy who, as far as he knows, was just some kid he used to bully, then never heard from again.

#+begin_quote
  “Vengeance is very sweet,” Snape breathed at Black. “How I hoped I would be the one to catch you...” [...]

#+end_quote

Sure, on first reading it, you would think Snape's primary motivator is getting revenge on the mass murderer who almost murdered him, too. But once you know "the twist", which was actually guessed by some people after PoA, it's glaringly obvious that Snape's desire to be the one to catch Sirius has to do with him thinking Sirius was the traitor, and he's furious because it looks like Sirius is managing to trick James's son just like he did James.

Snape was perfectly calm and capable of being civil to Lupin, even brewing his potion, and was also perfectly calm, if wary, around Sirius once he knew the truth.

#+begin_quote
  so he hears enough of the conversation to get the idea that Remus isn't in cahoots at all, he's just in enough denial and hatred to not really care and then lie about what he heard later to Fudge.
#+end_quote

He doesn't - between the moment the door opens, and the moment he reveals himself, Peter being the traitor isn't mentioned a single time. Instead, he's mentioned lovingly as part of the Marauders, and the entire thing sounds like a mass murderer and the man who /openly admits to covering for him/ trying to spin a story that will trick 3 children.

#+begin_quote
  And so I convinced myself that Sirius was getting into the school using dark arts he learned from Voldemort, that being an Animagus had nothing to do with it... so, in a way, Snape's been right about me all along.
#+end_quote

Any normal person looking at this entire incident would see a Voldemort-supporting mass murderer (and /nobody/ doubted his guilt), who has been trying to kill Harry the entire year (was him showing up in Harry's bedroom with a knife a cute misunderstanding, or what?), and whose method of entering the castle was known to Lupin. The latter, who has left his office without taking the potion, is currently in the process of regaling Harry with a heartwarming and completely irrelevant tale about the antics of his father while at school - it looks like Lupin is trying to distract Harry, by playing on his father issues, as a way of stalling for time until his transformation.

Saying that Snape should have suspected the truth, in these conditions, because the reader knows the truth, is lacking theory of mind.

In truth, very few aspects of the books are open to interpretation, by virtue of them being children's books - JKR has the characters spell out their feelings or motivations, or those of other characters', for the benefit of younger readers. The Fidelius Charm is, indeed, a plot-hole, but that's not the same thing as something being up for interpretation.

********** I did say to get the idea he wasn't in cahoots, not to know for certain - they did talk about Scabbers being Pettigrew and Pettigrew surviving a little bit before the door opened, as I recall (I admit I haven't read the books in years, though). Getting someone's soul destroyed is a bit of a leap if you're not absolutely certain of their crimes, no? Perhaps a leap someone who hated another person would make? Especially since Harry and Hermione saw he literally entered the tunnel a couple minutes after Lupin when they were time-travelling, meaning he likely could've heard more than just the bit after he entered. And by vitriol, I was more referring to the general deranged and angry spitting and snarling during and the prideful smirking and gloating afterward way he spoke and phrased rather than the terminology he used.

And I could alternatively ask why you're trusting a spy and someone who knowingly put a child in an unhappy home (ten dark and terrible years) when you're not trusting Harry? Who's to say that whole spy plot excuse wasn't a lie as well? Or even Sirius and Remus? Why not trust them?

And the interpretation of the Fidelius more comes from the attempted Watsonian explanations of their actions. Was Sirius genuinely worried that he'd be tortured so much he'd eventually go mad and give the answer willingly? Was Pettigrew an attempt to draw out a spy by getting them to target the one who could turn into a tiny rat and run away really easily? Did James and Lily not want the pressure of being their own secret keepers? Did the spell get updated and developed between their using it and the Weasley's using it? etc.

But again, as I said, I don't actually care what the answer is either way. I have no skin in the game in the Snape argument, I'll take whatever position a story I'm reading takes, so long as it fits the fic's inner logic and narrative voice.

*********** But they technically /were/ in cahoots - for an entire year, Lupin kept silent about Sirius being an Animagus, /despite being convinced that he was a mass murderer out to get Harry/. Not even after Sirius was seen standing over the children's beds, with a knife, did Lupin tell Dumbledore how Sirius was getting inside the castle.

What Snape didn't realise was that Lupin wasn't sacrificing the lives of children to help out his friend, he was doing it because he didn't want to look bad in front of Dumbledore. Which sounds so ridiculous, of course Snape would assume it's a lie.

This is the Trio's reaction (children who actually /like/ Lupin):

#+begin_quote
  Harry looked down at Ron, and as their eyes met, they agreed, silently: Black and Lupin were both out of their minds. Their story made no sense whatsoever. How could Scabbers be Peter Pettigrew? Azkaban must have unhinged Black after all---but why was Lupin playing along with him?

  Then Hermione spoke, in a trembling, would be calm sort of voice, as though trying to will Professor Lupin to talk sensibly.

  [this is immediately after they reach the Shack, and Lupin says Scabbers is Peter; then there's a long discussion about Peter being an Animagus, but absolutely nothing about him being a traitor]

  “If you're going to tell them the story, get a move on, Remus,” said Black, who was still watching Scabbers's every desperate move. “I've waited twelve years, I'm not going to wait much longer.”

  “All right... but you'll need to help me, Sirius,” said Lupin, “I only know how it began...”

  Lupin broke off. There had been a loud creak behind him. The bedroom door had opened of its own accord. All five of them stared at it.

  [then Lupin launches into a heartwarming story about what good pals he, Sirius, Peter and James's beloved father all were - which sounds extremely manipulative from an outside point of view]

That was the Ministry's and Dumbledore's problem. Snape took Sirius (and would have taken Lupin, too) to the rightful authorities, without harming him in any way (which is more than can be said about Sirius and his treatment of unconscious Snape).

And, again - there was absolutely no reason /not/ to be certain. The only new information, compared to 13 years previously, was that Sirius Black had slashed the Fat Lady, then broken into Gryffindor tower. Why didn't he go to Dumbledore, or at least write him a letter, telling him to check Scabbers? The only reason anyone would think Sirius and Lupin's story should have been taken seriously is because they have meta knowledge.

The fact that the entire scene, with Sirius, Lupin, and James 2.0, was taking place in the same spot where he'd almost been killed when he was 15 would have been a huge trigger, no doubt, but then it's all the more impressive that he managed to inflict zero harm on anyone (and only was harmed himself, again).

Yeah, that's why I said the Fidelius charm and the way it works is a plot-hole - once it's established that the information cannot be extracted from the Secret Keeper against his/her will, via Veritaserum/Imperius/Legilimency etc., it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever that they didn't make either Dumbledore, or one of the Potters, Secret Keeper.

The canon explanation, that they wanted to use Sirius as a decoy, only makes sense on the assumption that those methods /do/ work, and that they expected Voldemort to waste his time sending his followers after Sirius. Meanwhile, Peter could be hidden somewhere, and nobody would look for him. But even that was an idiotic plan - once Sirius was caught, the Potters' location couldn't be extracted from him, but the real Secret Keeper's identity could. And the entire logic of choosing Peter specifically because he was weak and a coward, who sided with the "biggest bully", as the person to trust with the secret to Voldemort's downfall was incredibly nonsensical, especially at a time when Voldemort was winning.

I think that entire plotline might be the biggest issue in the entire series, exactly because there's no Watsonian explanation that doesn't require everyone, including Dumbledore, to be a cretin.

Even if you go with "Dumbledore actually /wanted/ the Potters to be attacked, because he knew Voldemort would give Lily a chance to step aside, and the special magic would be activated" (and I could buy that), it still doesn't explain why the Potters weren't their own SK, or why James agreed to use Peter over Sirius.

An alternative possible explanation there was that he believes in his abilities and is confident he could survive whatever the curse threw at him until he could leave semi-gracefully like Lupin did at the end of year two and disappear into obscurity.

And as a final question - do you really believe that all the things he did were okay, simply because he did them to win a war he and Dumbledore didn't even have proof would restart again? 'cause that's how it's coming off - that him literally being a student's worst fear is okay simply because he was trying to keep his cover? That explanation equals excuse?

  Basically, what makes you believe Snape and Dumbledore about that whole "We don't trust each other" ruse when Snape is a spy (ie. his profession is to pretend to be things he isn't and lie to people) and Dumbledore is the type of man who'd knowingly send Harry to an unhappy childhood ("Ten dark and terrible years") when you don't believe what Harry thinks about Snape? What makes them more trustworthy to you than him?
#+end_quote

No, I understood whom you were referring to, I don't understand the comparison. Are you asking me why I believe that Dumbledore and Snape were working together to bring down Voldemort, and why I believe they know the history of the DADA post? Seriously?

Harry's not omniscient, and he's subjective, like everyone else - it's very clear when his likes and dislikes inform his opinion. See, for example, the way he complains about Snape supposedly talking about the Dark Arts "lovingly", with Hermione pointing out that, actually, he sounded exactly like Harry.

In any case, concerning the DADA post, Harry's opinion really is worthless, since he has no way of knowing what Snape truly thinks on the matter. All he has to go on is a rumour he heard from Percy.

#+begin_quote
  An alternative possible explanation there was that he believes in his abilities and is confident he could survive whatever the curse threw at him until he could leave semi-gracefully like Lupin did at the end of year two and disappear into obscurity.
#+end_quote

And what would be the point? It would mean that Snape didn't actually care about protecting Harry and defeating Voldemort, and that his goal in life was to be the DADA teacher for one year. Not only is that out-of-character and directly contradicted by canon (there's an entire scene that establishes Snape's reason for staying at Hogwarts is to protect Harry, and prepare for Voldemort's return), it's the sort of moronic writing that has people look down on fanfic.

#+begin_quote
  And as a final question - do you really believe that all the things he did were okay, simply because he did them to win a war he and Dumbledore didn't even have proof would restart again? 'cause that's how it's coming off - that him literally being a student's worst fear is okay simply because he was trying to keep his cover? That explanation equals excuse?
#+end_quote

How is this related, in any way, to the fact that thinking Snape tried, every year, to get himself killed/booted via the curse is idiotic?

But if we're going down the tired "Neville's BoGgArt" path... are hands literally being a student's worst fear ok? I think the Ministry should have led a strong campaign to chop off everyone's hands. Alternatively, can we talk about the absolute sociopath that is Hermione? She fears failing an exam more than the deaths of her parents? And Ron - his sister has just been nearly killed by Voldemort's memory and a Basilisk, and his greatest fear are spiders?

There's a Doylist explanation for the Boggart, and a Watsonian one, and neither has to do with Snape being eViL.

As for his general teaching behaviour - not only do I think it's ok, I think it's outright saintly compared to the monsters that are Hagrid and McGonagall.

They send 11 y.o. children, on their own, to find the horrendous Unicorn killer; McGiggles turns her own students into bullying targets, and locks Neville outside of his common room while a mass murderer is on the loose; she lets Harry train in dangerous conditions because she's that desperate to win the Cup, etc. As for Hagrid...

#+begin_quote
  “It bit me!” he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief. “I'm not going to be able to hold a quill for a week. I tell you, that dragon's the most horrible animal I've ever met, but the way Hagrid goes on about it, you'd think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off for frightening it. And when I left, he was singing it a lullaby.”
#+end_quote

​

#+begin_quote
  Hagrid's smile faded off his face.\\
  "Yeh'll do wha' yer told," he growled, "or I'll be takin' a leaf outta Professor Moody's book. . . . I hear yeh made a good ferret, Malfoy."\\
  The Gryffindors roared with laughter. Malfoy flushed with anger, but apparently the memory of Moody's punishment was still sufficiently painful to stop him from retorting.\\
  [...]\\
  "Look like they're havin' fun, don' they?" Hagrid said happily. Harry assumed he was talking about the skrewts, because his classmates certainly weren't; every now and then, with an alarming bang, one of the skrewts' ends would explode, causing it to shoot forward several yards, and more than one person was being dragged along on their stomach, trying desperately to get back on their feet.\\
  [...]\\
  Harry noticed her eyes travel over Dean (who had a nasty cut across one cheek). Lavender (whose robes were badly singed), Seamus (who was nursing several burnt fingers), and then to the cabin windows, where most of the class stood, their noses pressed against the glass waiting to see if the coast was clear.
#+end_quote

But Snape docked 5 points from Ron for physically attacking Draco, the injustice!

Also, the fact that Harry thinks Draco being tortured, then being threatened with more torture, is hilarious, is exactly the reason why you shouldn't treat his opinions as if they were fact.

And well, that's your interpretation, no? :D

Another example is the Fidelius - even if you don't include the times that Rowling breaks her own rules (eg. Bill telling Harry that Arthur and Co are at Muriels even though he's stated to not be the secret keeper and thus can't share that secret), that still provides a mess of interpretations. We know from Bill that you can be the secret keeper of your own place and that the Secret can only be shared willingly, so why wasn't a Potter the secret keeper for their Godric's Hollow hiding place? Why was Sirius worried about giving up the secret if he couldn't share it willingly? Since the answers aren't directly given, you can take a whole bunch of interpretations.

To be fair to her, they probably were back when she wrote the first book. But then she wrote a few more books and apparently forgot everything she'd written originally and added new rules and then it all broke down.

******* But there's an alternative explanation for his antagonism toward each and every DADA professor, and there clearly /is/ a ruse, since the official story is that "Dumbledore refuses Snape the job because he doesn't trust him", when clearly he /does/ trust him, so yeah, the idea that a lateral move in his current place of employment is his highest ambition can largely be dismissed.

Hell, at the time of telling Bellatrix Dumbledore has always refused him the job because he doesn't trust him, he probably knew the job will be his in the coming school year.

*** It's not canon that he /wants/ it, it's canon that he applied for it, repeatedly. And in HBP it's revealed why - he and Dumbledore concocted a story that Dumbledore never fully trusted Snape, and that Snape had reason to resent Dumbledore (as [[/u/HagofaSophia][u/HagofaSophia]] has rightly pointed out in the OP), which would make it more believable to Voldemort that Snape never truly became Dumbledore's man.

The quote from OotP that you posted actually proves this - the fact that Snape kept applying, despite knowing very well Dumbledore would reject him, makes no sense /unless/ you realise that Snape didn't expect his application to be accepted.

The interview you posted precedes the last two books - /obviously/ JKR wouldn't have given away the real reason behind the whole DADA story, since it would have made Snape's true loyalties clear. Of course Dumbledore fully and completely trusted Snape.

The fact that the first mention of Snape mentions his desire for the DADA post is... very clearly meant to be a giant red herring, and part of the reason Harry suspects him, and not Quirrell, throughout the first book.

As for the other DADA teachers - Snape was asked by Dumbledore to keep an eye on Quirrell, his distaste for incompetent Lockhart makes perfect sense (and he's still civil towards him), his suspicions regarding Lupin hiding information about Sirius were actually true, his wariness of Moody is perfectly normal, and Umbridge was universally hated.

The reason Snape took the post in Y6 was because he and Dumbledore knew that Dumbledore would be dead in less than a year, Snape would have to flee, and Hogwarts would fall to Voldemort. At which point, Dumbledore hoped, Snape would be named Headmaster, so the DADA position would become irrelevant.

** It's a fact that Snape "loved" the Dark Arts, and DADA was the closest thing to it while at Hogwarts, but I wonder if the rumor that he wanted to teach the class does not just come from his animosity with pretty much all the previous DADA teachers?

Of course, I can't speak for before 1991 since we don't know who taught it then, but from the time Harry arrived at Hogwarts :

1. Quirrel : A previous Muggle Studies teacher, who seem barely competent. Is also the main suspect about who would want to steal the thing protected in the 3rd floor corridor (not to mention has Voldemort behind his head but I doubt Snape learnt about it before Harry).
2. Lockart : Well pretty much the perfect opposite of Snape. While Snape doesn't care about appearence and focus on skills, Lockart is someone completely incompetent who only cares about appearances.
3. Lupin : Just a guy part of a group he hated for most of his life, who also happen to be a werewold who almost killed him when he was 16.
4. Moody : Dark Wizard catcher who antagonized him for most of the year. (Because Barty impersonated him and hated Snape for his lack of "loyalty" for the Dark Lord but most people believed in him).
5. Umbridge : 100% incompetent to teach any class, and is just really easy to hate in general.

I mean, if he treated all the previous DADA teachers like this one (barely masked comptent if not outright hate), no wonder students thought he wanted their job.

Might be a little bit far-fetched, but maybe it was Dumbledore's way of ensuring Snape's position as a spy. Ultimately, if Voldemort knows that Snape has been refused to become a DADA professor, just as he was, he would be more trusting to him...

** I believe it. Snape needed to keep up the appearance for the other side as well, and making it look like he wants the Dark Arts job could be his way of letting the Death Eaters and Voldemort know that he hasn't moved from his old ways. This isn't to say that Snake didn't want it, on the contrary, I think he really wanted the job but I think applying each year (despite fully knowing the oncoming rejection) was done for a greater purpose. And as you said, he was permitted in the 6th year, because Dumbledore was dying (and he wanted Slughorn to join Hogwarts).

Not only this but creating false rumours for appearance has been done before by Dumbledore - he made the public believe that the Shrieking Shack is haunted for Remus Lupin's sake. He's well verse in giving air to such things.
