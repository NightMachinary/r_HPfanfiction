Someone recommended a fic for me, but couldn't remember the title. In their words:

#+begin_quote
  Hermione and Ron's relationship was on again off again because Ron is a doof and Hermione and Sirius end up getting shit faced together at a party, having sex, and then getting married. Due to magical wizard marriage laws they can't divorce until a year into the marriage so they stick it out, move in together and have all sorts of fun adventures trying to hide it from disapproving friends and family.
#+end_quote

Does anybody recognize this description?


** While I am not familiar with this particular fic, I can rec some other Sirius/Hermione fics while you wait!

[[http://asylums.insanejournal.com/daily_deviant/217662.html]] "A Valiant Effort" Hermione/Sirius/Remus NC-17, R, XXX. Threesome, very adult.

(Leaving this here because it's an awesome fic, but it is not what OP requested at all) [[http://sam-storyteller.dreamwidth.org/55719.html]] Tagged at chapter 28, not at ch.1. Hermione/Sirius Cartographer's Craft is a classic SB/HGP. Harry discovers a diary!Sirius.

*** Upon reflection, "Cartographer's Craft" is not the fic I wanted to rec. I will have to look up and link later since I am still on mobile. My apologies!

Edited 12 days later... because I think I finally found the fic I wanted to rec to you. It's definitely not the one you were searching for, and I found two links to it that don't seem to be the same... but "Then Shall I Know" is the fic!

** Any more recs? This is my favourite pairing and I think I've read everything out there almost. Although, I haven't read the one OP is asking about, but it sounds good!
