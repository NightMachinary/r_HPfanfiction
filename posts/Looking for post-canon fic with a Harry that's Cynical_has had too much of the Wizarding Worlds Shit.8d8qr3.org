Basically what it says. Harry can be OP in a power sense as long as he's still fallible. Perfectly fine with time travel, cross overs, or whatever, as long as you have a Cynical/done with this shit Harry who's still a fundamentally good person. Just as an example of the type of stuff I'm looking for here's a few fics of this type that I liked [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8501689/1/The-Havoc-side-of-the-Force][Havoc Side of the Force]] [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/Wind-Shear][Wind Shear]] [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6257522/1/A-Fine-Spot-of-Trouble][Fine Spot of Trouble]]

  Gen. Harry has reached a very bitter thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the pure-blood bigotry. Then he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear down the system and salt the earth.

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.

** Regarding [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6257522/1/A-Fine-Spot-of-Trouble][Fine Spot of Trouble]] - i've seen it recommended before and Chilord's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/Wind-Shear][Wind Shear]] was pretty fun read, but i've always found whole "Draco Malfoy to the rescue!" premise to be a huge turn-off.

But this time my resolve finally cracked and i decided to give it a chance. And I'm kinda regretting it now?

First of all it is because this particular fic introduced me to the idea of Harry seeing Teddy as "what could have been" in regards to him and Tonks, and it's now my headcanon and forces me to re-evaluate other fics\original books with that perspective in mind and it breaks my heart a little every time.

Secondly it is trying way to hard to whitewash Malfoy family. Andromeda and Narcissa reconciliation happened way to fast. Malfoy sr. not being in jail is affront to justice. I can understand why Harry might bail Narcissa out and with some effort she might convince him to extend his mercy towards Draco as well, but there is no way i can see for Lucius to remain free man. And Potter being all buddy-buddy with Draco just doesn't track for me.

And lastly almost everyone is a cunt in this fic. I acknowledge that "everybody's a bit of a cunt sometimes", but here it's rather "a lot of a cunt, most of the time". Sometimes its seems to stray perilously close, if not right into, bashing territory. I'm at chapter 15, out of 24, and so far, out all of them, only Harry has an excuse to be a cunt on a level demonstrated there. Does it get better? Do we get an explanation as to why? I mean Harry spent 3 years inside a bottle of firewhisky and nobody noticed? Except for Lucius bloody Malfoy?

*** I got to chapter 10 and it certainly has its issues. Mainly, Hermione simply forgetting about Harry. It was her one defining, constant trait that she was at Harry's side all the time. She chose helping Harry over Ron. She didn't notice three years of alcoholism? She, who had Cho figured out before Harry even noticed that there was something wrong with her?

Draco's change is actually believable in that fic, but I agree with regards to Lucius. Especially considering how cynical this Harry is.

The author also hasn't figured out what to do with Lupin. If everyone describes him as "a good man, BUT", perhaps he wasn't that great after all. Harry has no contact with the man outside of the DADA class and the Order picking him up, and yet there's a supposed deep bond? He ran away from Andromeda's pregnant daughter and yet she still thinks he was a decent bloke?

I mean, I never liked how the Lupin/Tonks/Teddy plotline ended in canon, but Rowling admitted that the books were influenced by her trying to hold onto a toxic ex (or something along those lines). But the author took things one confusion level higher because everyone is saying one thing and yet their words express something else.

#+end_quote

Yeah, that particular character got dumped on pretty hard here. She was bossy, authority worshipping "insufferable know-it-all" and rather pants in human-to-human interaction, but she got better as time went on. Here she just got worse.\\
Their reason for hanging Harry out to dry was apparently either [[/spoiler][subconscious resentment over Harry "abandoning" them to fight the bigotry of the wizarding world on their own]] and\or it was [[/spoiler][Hermione semi-conscious decision to avoid /actually/ asking Harry's opinions on things and keep using his name as battering ram to push her agenda forward]], and both of those, IMO, rather stupid considering everything they went through together.

As to how Lupin was treated in this particular fic - my line of thinking is that it is mixture of "do not speak ill of the dead", wanting to spare Teddy knowledge of how shitty his father actually was, and people looking at the past with somewhat rose tinted glasses and inventing and excusing things to make themselves feel better.
