I was listening to the second book of Discworld today, and the topic of elves came up, and how they are portrayed differently in different cultures and mediums. And so I thought.

You know of Collective Unconsciousness, right? How if enough people believed in someone being a god, that someone would become a god.

What if wizards didn't give enough justice for the influence normal people have on the world until it became much more apparent?

What if the Collective Unconsciousness had a greater impact on the magical side?

For instance, (house)elves were like they were for most of history. But then came Tolkien, and since then, if you ask someone how elves look, they'll bring Tolkien. If someone asks if dragons can talk, they'll answer "yes". And as such, the magic responds and changes the world to fit the mind well.

First to change are magical creatures, then the world around them, then humans themselves. After all, if you ask someone if you can become a mage by learning, most people would respond "yes".


** You show me an idea that radically changes the magic system, and all I can think of is the ministry running around trying to keep up with everything.

All I can picture is panicking ministry employees trying to deal with sudden changes when big blockbusters hit the muggle scene like the MCU or /shudders/ Twilight.

Auror: Madam Bones, there's a vampire uprising, and none of the Lumos spells are working on them!

Bones: What do you mean, not working?

Auror: It just makes them prettier.

Bones: What? How... Damn muggles and their stupid kinemas.

And then anime becomes popular worldwide, then we're all f*cked.

Edit: The replies I've been getting make a lot more sense and wholeheartedly agree with your reasoning. What I've written is only meant to an attempt at crackfic style humour.

*** But none of those are true cultural influences. Things like Tolkien Elves are nigh universal, if you ask any person what an "elf" is, a majority of people are gonna have Tolkien's works in their mind, alongside the portrayals inspired by it.

Anime or marvel isn't nearly so world-altering or universally known, not to mention the subtle differences in perception - a superhero isn't the same as a wizard. An anime protagonist with "powers" isn't the same as a wizard.

In most people's minds, A wizard is old, has a beard, lives in a tower and reads books all day and has his moments of summoning the elements and annihilating orc armies. A lot of the time, especially in a world where the HP books don't exist, they gain their powers from long study and experimentation or from otherworldly entities, not an inherent quality.

A witch flies on a broom and has a cat familiar, however modern conceptions are slowly changing this into witches becoming more modern but with an increasingly occult twist, and also support the idea that witches gain their powers through study and deals with otherworldly entities, now more than ever.

*** It could go different ways, with, like you said, gradual change, with the world changing over time, or it could go the "retcon" way, leaving anyone non the wiser about what happend, except some scarce individuals that are "off" of the reality vector. Like Dumble or maybe Harry.

For insnace, one day everyone's going to class, and no one notices, except Harry, that their techer is now Orland Bloom-looking, long-eared supermodel named Dobbion. Or on the next sorting ceremony, some of the students are there for the Mage course for those born without magic.

Either way, it would probably not jump to sudden changes after every movie or game (unless it's a crackfic), but would have to reach critical mass in the CU to take effect.

** Tom Riddle is just a normal, courteous kid who was molded into a hideous totalitarian snake monster from years of persuasive urban legends because he blew the whistle on Hagrid, and everyone /knows/ Hagrid couldn't be the Heir of Slytherin.

Slytherins as a whole are turned into stupid racist caricatures and cowards because everyone /knows/ that that's what Slytherins are.

*** You know, that sounds baller!

Turning someone into a monster just because people believed he was one. With time, as more people considered him a monster, he was becoming one even more, which made people to have even worse opinion on him. Put that into a perpetual CU circle of fear and hate, and Tom becomes an embodiment of antichrist.

** I played a really good text game with a similar concept called Heroes of Myth (by Choice of Games) It's on every app store if you want to check it out.

** It's a really cool idea and tackled in many works of fiction. Its a setup that can go in a myriad of different directions depending on the writer too. I personally would write some antagonist organization that would molds the collective unconscious through targeted subliminal messaging like ads and stuff.

I think the last time I saw something like this was in Chaos;Head anime. (I may be thinking of the wrong anime name though)

** That raises a question, what do most people think of when you say 'elves'?\\
Do they think of Santa's elves, dutifully serving and making toys for everyone, or do they think of high fantasy elves, with their pointy ears and treehouses?

*** I would say the second ones.

The fact that you had to add "Santa's" instead of "Tolkien's" (for instance) just proves this.
