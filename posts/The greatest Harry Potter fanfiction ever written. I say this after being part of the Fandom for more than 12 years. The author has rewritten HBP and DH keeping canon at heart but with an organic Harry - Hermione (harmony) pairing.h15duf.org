#+TITLE: The greatest Harry Potter fanfiction ever written. I say this after being part of the Fandom for more than 12 years. The author has rewritten HBP and DH keeping canon at heart but with an organic Harry - Hermione (harmony) pairing. This is as if JKR herself has decided to listen to the fans.

** Huh...I am /fairly/ sure this runs a massive risk of getting DMCAed.

**** Copyright struck. There are enormous amounts of original work just plastered all over those stories. It's one thing to rewrite a scene, but copying and pasting the whole book and then just modifying certain paragraphs...that's not all that transformative and given how tenuous fanfics are vs copyright, I could see the whole thing getting shut down.

**** Copyright. A lot of it is word for word canon.

** Is this even fanfiction? It's canon with a few extra lines thrown in.

** I wonder what percentage of this “fanfic” was lifted straight from the book. 99%?

Also love the arbitrary decision to move the timeline five years in the future. It doesn't even have that much of an impact, it's just so unnecessary.
