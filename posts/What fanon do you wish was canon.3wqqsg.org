We've all got something (I think) that we've read or that we've come up with that totally should have been in Rowling's books, so let's hear'em.

** *Realistic* fallout after the War. I know that there is an epilog, but it really is a deus ex machina (seriously, the last line is 'All is well'!). I want to see: 1. Killing Voldermort made things /worse/, because the society which allowed (and in some ways even encouraged) the rise of the Dark Lord hasn't changed at all and now the dark side can find a competent, not insane leader. 2. Given the likely estimates of the population of magic users (around 10,000 in the UK), the fall out from the deaths/imprisonment of so many wizard and witches of child bearing age destroys the next generation. Especially combined with the fact that magic users on the whole appear to have very few children (excluding the Weasley's most only have a single child). 3. Muggles notice the whole war/the rise of technology detects the wizarding world.

The large swaths of mostly men coming back from overseas with what they, misguidedly, dubbed "battle fatigue" or "combat neurosis". The period after WW2 is known as the "greatest generation" because of the huge boom in economic status, because of the money made during the war. While not every veteran develops PTSD, but 50-55% of veterans who spent time in active war zone experience mild-to-severe PTSD ([[http://www.ptsd.ne.gov/what-is-ptsd.html][source for stat]]). Winning a war also has NO basis in whether one has PTSD or not. Your attitude and dismissal of real problems are exactly why veterans who do have symptoms and issues do not get the help they need.

- The girl was tortured several times for supporting her guy, the guy went willingly to his death to save his girl (and other loved ones)

- Finally, after a brief glimpse of the 'heaven', the guy still decided to come back to join his girl, what would the girl think of that?

- On top of that, they shared a common interest (quidditch) and many personality traits (wicked sense of humor).

For example, nothing has been done about the anti-Slytherin sentiment, the old boys club/Pureblood network, the sentiment about muggleborns, the loss of wizarding traditions and the hate arising from that, the anti-creature laws and attitude. If you don't have point 2 (imprisonment/death of those involved) then point 1 can not be avoided.

By the time Hitler died, most of his upper command structure was gone, either killed fighting each other or on the front. What was left was a hand full of zealots. A better example then killing Hitler might be the fallout of WW1 leading directly to WW2. The hardships suffered in Germany due to the Treaty of Versailles gave Hitler the opportunity to gain power.

The Battle of Hogwarts was an annihilation battle against Voldemort's forces, because apparition out of Hogwarts was impossible. You need to read carefully about that chapter to get the details.

So if the Dark fraction is killed off at the BoH, there must be a fallout in terms of population loss. We don't know how many magicals there are (JKR has said different things at different times, and none of that matches up to canon), but best guesses place the total population of magicals in the UK is at around 10,000. If the battle of Hogwarts was really that bloody, especially considering most of the fighters were between the ages of 12-50, that is a massive slice of the fertile population, and especially important in Pureblood groups, who would refuse to marry outside of their social circles.

It isn't disliked because of how it sounds. Plenty of things in HP sound silly. People hate it because magically binding oaths are an overused /deus ex machina/ plot device.

So with that logic I always liked to imagine a scene were Harry would look the judge dead in the eye and say something like:

#+begin_quote
  /"I solemnly swear on my magic that I am not responsible for the murders and subsequent annihilation of the Houses of Malfoy, Prince, Nott, Rosier, Gaunt, [add another few dozens names] and Goyle. So mote it be." And with those words the enchantments that the twins and Hermione wove on his robes activated, making him emanate a soft golden glow./

#+begin_quote

If making oaths was this easy they'd be done as part of daily life. The 'unbreakable oath' we see in canon requires 2 consenting people with a 3rd party doing the casting. It's not something you can do on your own as an easy way to convince a crowd that you're not lying.

Is this implying that Harry is tricking the judge into thinking he swore an oath? If it could be faked Harry wouldn't be the first person to try. That would mean that people don't take oaths seriously, or they have ways to check the oath.

 

I just think the way oaths are often used in fanfics is very AU from canon and introduces a lot of plot problems.

*** What is the issue with magical cores? I get that it's over used, and people make up elaborate descriptions that can seem a little ridiculous. But either people are pulling the magic from their environment or they're pulling it from inside themselves. When authors choose the latter option, what's the problem with using magical cores as a way to visualize the magic they're using? Sure it's not canon, but there are lots of things that aren't canon that crop up fairly regularly in fanfic that don't really get complained about. And quite a lot of the fun of fanfics is the additions to canon and fleshing out bits of the world that weren't focussed on in the original books.

- Evil Dumbledore binding Harry's core
- Getting 'magically exhausted'
- Harry having a 'massive core' allowing him to be OP
- Light vs Dark cores.

Really, I don't want to know where magic comes from. Maybe they suck it from the backside of a blackhole, maybe they siphon it from the surrounding environment, or maybe it is a core. If JKR had defined it's mechanism from the beginning it wouldn't be a problem. But if she tries to drop in the definition this late in the game it'll conflict at some point(s) with how she's already written the world.

****** I read it less than a year ago and I liked it a lot. It definitely has its flaws, the writing is oddly detached and often hints at emotions rather than spell everything out the way most stories do.

Harry's pretty OP but there was a very reasonable build-up to it and he doesn't use those powers to solve everything because they scare so many people and a sizeable portion of the wizarding world thinks he's insane and evil thanks to Rita Skeeter's bad press. He still cares very much what people and the Ministry think about him and he's trying to achieve his dream of becoming an Auror, so he hides a lot of what he can do.

I think everything takes so long because the author's real interest lies in the details of daily life in the wizarding world rather than a cookie-cutter "Harry fights the villains and wins" plot. There are lots of little genius ideas embedded in the story, like the Godric Gryffindor one you brought up. One of my favorites is Harry's realization that Dumbledore acted so benevolent and mildly barmy so that people wouldn't fear his power, and Harry's utilizing the same manner at a press conference to calm the crowd and look better to the public.

The original characters are top-notch, no Sues and you actually care what happens to them. The Auror testing and training and going out on calls is also great. The fight scenes are not the focus and it really shows, they're just kind of short and then over. But I loved the dimension hopping in the third story, that was really fun.

***** True. If this was in place, I think it would also not mean 100% safety i.e. a fall that would have been fatal leads to broken bones instead. It would be written off as people getting lucky.

****** Exactly- nothing could stop Quidditch injuries but the special protection means even cracking open Harry's head in 6th year was a non-fatal bludger bump. Only reason I attribute it to Dumbledore is the death of Myrtle, before Albus was Headmaster. Then again, if the No-Student-Fatalities Charm is a Headmaster tradition, it could be that a Founder's object like the Basilisk or Gryffindor's sword can trump the protection.

#+begin_quote
  Sort of a sequel and a companion piece to Dudley's Memories. Harry is finding a healthy outlet for his "saving people thing" in the form of one damaged little boy. In doing so he finds himself thinking about his old teacher, quite a bit.

  Minerva needs help delivering another letter to #4 Privet Drive. At forty, Dudley is not at all what Harry expects. A long overdue conversation ensues. DH cannon compliant, but probably not the way you think. Prologue to "Snape's Memories".
