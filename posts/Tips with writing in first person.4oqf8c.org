Hey guys, I am currently writing a fic that has 1st person POV and I was hoping for some tips in that POV so that it doesn't turn into a steaming pile of shit.


** Look up well-liked first person POV novels. Novel novels, not fanfiction novels. Go to your local library. Read the crap out of them. Note the things about first person POV that they do well, and the things they don't. Emulate the things they do well, avoid the ones they don't.

Of course, that might be/probably is more research than you want to put in. My personal thoughts:

1. Joe's Wastelands of Time. Very enjoyable fic, though I don't believe first person was the right choice, because the protagonist knew so much more weird stuff than we as the reader, that the immersion we were supposed to be feeling suffered.

2. Edit, edit, edit, edit, hand off to a beta or two, edit, hand back to the beta(s), edit, let it sit for a couple hours/days, read it, edit (if necessary), then post. First person is the easiest POV to write, but far harder to do well than 3rd person. And 2nd person is... strange, so don't worry about that one.

3. (Relates to 1) Remember that the reader learns as the protagonist learns. Paired with this is that the reader's perceptions mimic/mirror that of the protagonist. Don't forget that the first person POV is, almost by definition, an unreliable narrator.

** First, consider whether you /need/ to make the fic first person, or not. First-Person fics can be, as a whole, more enjoyable and engaging to write than your average third-person fic, but that depends almost exclusively on the necessity of it. If a fic, or even original fiction, could be conveyed just as effectively through third person, stick with third person. First person is rarely effective in stories other than the ones that require the limited perspective of one person, or, if the narrating character is has a strong voice and/or is inherently unreliable.

My personal rule is that if a fic is character-driven, first-person is generally the stronger POV, while third-person is far stronger for event-driven (or plot-driven) stories.

If you've decided on First-Person, then it's time to work on prose, because the rules are a bit different. First-person allows you to be more informal, as if your narrating character is having a conversation with your audience. This is First-Person's greatest advantage over Third-Person, because if it's a natural fit, you're going to have an easier time writing it. Focus on the character's thoughts, and their observations about whatever situation they're in. Don't be afraid to go on tangents or have your character make jokes, comparisons, or tell anecdotes, all with the intention of circling around back to where you started: again, you're having a conversation with the reader through the character, and all of these things make up organic dialogue. Leave the clunky brevity and formality of third-person behind, because first-person has to flow /really/ well to be even moderately successful.

I concur with [[/u/yarglethatblargle]] that you should devote time to reading first-person novels, original novels. I don't think this is negotiable; you don't read first person as often as third, so it's hard to get a grasp of the POV without studying it a little bit. Read two or three successful first person books and try to wrestle out what makes them successful, what literary and stylistic techniques they use. You don't have to outright rip them off, but it doesn't hurt to use them for inspiration.

Finally, be prepared for diminished response. First-Person, while still far more common than Second-Person, is still out of the norm compared to third, and a lot of people (this sub included) dislike reading it simply because it's different and doesn't jive with the established tone of canon. So, if you're looking for a lot of feedback, or reviews or whatever, you're going to have a bad time. Having written several first-person fics myself, the lack of feedback can be frustrating, and probably won't help if you're ever short on motivation.

*** Thanks for all your advice, I'll definitely take it. Also after thinking about it 1st person actually works well for my story.

** My honest advice is 'don't'. Out of hundreds of fanfictions I've read, only one has been good. The rest were angst ridden Twilight style nonsense. I even wrote one myself which I happy to admit didn't work the way I wanted it to.

** I think first-person perspective is best reserved for choose-your-own-adventure stories.

*** I think you mean 2nd person, that would make more sense since the author is talking to the reader letting them know what they are doing and they're choices.
