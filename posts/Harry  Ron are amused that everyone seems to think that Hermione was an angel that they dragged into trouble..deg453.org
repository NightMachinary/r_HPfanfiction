:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
The only thing I remember about the fic is that at one point Harry and Ron are discussing/reflecting/reminiscing. They are amused to note that people seem to think that Hermione was a perfectly straight-laced student that they kept dragging into trouble, when, in truth, she was often gung-ho about seriously breaking rules if she thought it right, and she could be more vicious than either of them.

  ::Year 2 Divergence:: What does it take, to reshape a child? And if reshaped, what then is formed? Down in the Chamber, a choice is made. (Harry's Gryffindor traits were always so much scarier than other peoples'.)

** I know there's one exactly like what you're describing, I've definitely read it, but I can't recall even a bit of what it was called.

One that's close that I searched for a bit and found again was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7725039/1/In-Which-the-Pink-Elephant-Hides-Under-a-Lampshade][In Which the Pink Elephant Hides Under a Lampshade]], which is somewhat the same thing, but not the one you're looking for (probably), though it's still a good read.

** There are probably a bunch of fics that do that...

Minor quibble, the phrase is actually "strait-laced". "Strait" means strict, restricted, confining.

*** I tried to look up evidence as to whether or not straight-laced is accepted and the verdict is kind of. Merriam Webster lists it as a variant of Strait-laced and the OED doesn't seem to have it at all.
