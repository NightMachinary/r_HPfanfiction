  The Dark Lord divines what Harry Potter is in the Forbidden Forest, and revelations lead to incomprehensible consequences. Lord Voldemort has won... and the dystopia is damning. A tale of a fallen hero, dark desires, and a Dark Lord's obsession with something he has lost and finds himself unwillingly lusting after: a soul.

** Linkao3(Hermione Granger and the intended vessels)

Marriage law Hermione/Snape fic. Snape is in character here and their "relationship" is not shown as healthy or happy. One of the few Snape romance fics I have seen that explore his character realistically and do not ignore his flaws or struggles connecting to people.

The plot is very well thought out (even if it seems completely ridiculous at first). There are lots of twists and things that seem completely stupid and confusing that end up with a perfectly logical explanation. There is lots of humour, great dialogue that perfectly captures the characters along with great action scenes and AU world building.

This is legislated /rape/ and /slavery/, and any system that would attempt it is corrupt beyond keeping and should be killed with fire.

  AU. A marriage law is instigated during Hermione's sixth year. Hermione considers her options and makes her choice, it just wasn't the one they were expecting. By saving herself Hermione's decisions cause ripples to run through the Order. The game has changed, those left behind need to adapt to survive.

**** I can definitely see your point, this fic is not for everyone for sure and you do have to ignore the usual marriage law trope to get into it. I admit I originally started reading it for the dub con smut (which has since been toned down by the author in their recent update), but was really impressed by the plot, characters and writing otherwise. It does a good job portraying an unhealthy relationship like OP requested which is why I recced it.

Yes, I have found this plot point to be completely ridiculous and something I expect to find in a bad crack smut fic. The author really surprised me though in just how logically and sensibly they managed to explain the entire thing at the end though.

It was part of Voldemorts plan of making perfect horcrux containers. The details are complicated to explain but the full explanation really does make this ridiculous premise make sense in the context of the plot

  [newly edited as of Feb '18] Sometimes all it takes to change the world is one small, simple choice. On the night the Death Eaters attack Hogwarts, Hermione Granger makes such a choice. Her life---and her world---will never be the same.By killing Draco, she saves Dumbledore and keeps Voldemort at bay for a little while. But evil never sleeps for long. When a Ministry decree forces her to marry Professor Snape---a cruel, cold man who's apparently hated her since she was a child---in order to be used as a breeder of superior wizards, Hermione doesn't think her life can get any worse. She's wrong.Soon, Voldemort's after her and her friends (again), her life is in grave peril, and all her hopes for a future at all, much less a happy one, rest on her own shoulders---and on Snape, her unwanted husband, whose heart still belongs to a woman long dead.

There are a couple of stories, actually, that flip the idea that if Harry was a girl that Snape's behavior towards her would be very, very disturbing.

Charlotte, the Great and Powerful. Female Harry has a relationship or a physical flirtation---not sex, though---with Blaise, Barty, and Sirius. Possibly a bit DE apologism---she hates them more for death and killing than their racism.
