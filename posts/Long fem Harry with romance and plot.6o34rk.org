I've been searching for a good female Harry that has romance (which isn't the main point of the story) and I've come up short. The closest I've found to what I'm looking for is the pure blood pretense but the series isn't complete and there isn't really romance.

-No fem slash please - Also please no romance with snape or Sirius or some other guy with a huge age gap - I'd rather the romance not be a time travel with tom riddle but it's okay.


** linkffn(A long journey home by rakeesh) fits, although there is a bit of an age-discrepancy - definitly no minors involved thogh and Jasmine is the older one.

And the romance is only part of the plot and not the reason why the fic was written.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

** linkffn(11437578) might be what you're looking for. I've been enjoying it, although the over arching story isn't complete, the first two books are and they're a good chunk into the third.

  Fem!Slytherin!Harry (Mary); realistic!Dursleys; consistent!Professors; mature!Snape; follows the books VERY closely, especially the first three chapters or so (but with 50% more snark). See first chapter for preface. Most chapters K-rated, T for language, several sections from Snape's perspective are T. Later books may be M-rated. McG first contact/guardian. PM for pdf.
