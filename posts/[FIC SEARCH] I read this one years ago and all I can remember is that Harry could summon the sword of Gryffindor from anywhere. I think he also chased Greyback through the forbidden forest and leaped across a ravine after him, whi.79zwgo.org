#+TITLE: [FIC SEARCH] I read this one years ago and all I can remember is that Harry could summon the sword of Gryffindor from anywhere. I think he also chased Greyback through the forbidden forest and leaped across a ravine after him, which also prompted surprise from Greyback that he could make the jump.

**** Random question for you.

I've been looking for a fic for a bit, and I'm wondering if this one is it.

At some point Harry leaves the Sword of Gryffindor somewhere and Lucius Malfoy and some Death Eaters come across it. Harry summons the sword and so it disappears right in front of the Death Eaters.

One of them like, waves his hand through where the sword is or something. Coincidentally at that exact moment Harry /un/summons the sword, and it appears stabbed through the guy's hand. He dies from the Basilisk venom, I think.

Is this the fic, do you know?

***** Yep, this is the one. But I don't think it's the guys hand, i think his chest gets impaled. Some random OC waving it around spouting ownership or something. Then Harry realised that when he unsummoned it, it didn't go back to the box that is it's usual storage place, so he had to resummon it and keep it on his person till he could give it to his house elf to be stored again.

** Harry was also a metamorph and I'm pretty sure he had a box system labelled by numbers for storage that made no sense to the reader.
