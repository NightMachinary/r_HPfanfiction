Does anybody have really good missing moment type canon fics. They could be one-shots or longer ones, no real preference. Maybe ones that focus on characters outside of the trio and their main friend circle. Thanks so much:)


** Most Fics written by FloreatCastellum are canon compliant and a lot of them take place during it. Her fics are also of pretty high quality.

  Remus's mind is usually a tidy place. The worst has already happened, what's left to be scared of? His fears are labelled, annotated, and most of all, archived. For one evening, though, he'll have to let them come out and play. (Remus prepares the Boggart for his lesson with the third years. Featuring Severus Snape as an unwanted critic, and Sirius Black as the elephant in the room.)

  Cho cried and she survived Pansy Parkinson's cruel jabs about a dead boy. She wept and she passed all her classes, kept up with Quidditch, watched fairweather friends scatter in the cold wind. She got very good at wordlessly summoning tissues and she joined the DA against her parents' wishes.They had told her to behave, begged her, ordered her, as the threatening darknesses of the world clung close even inside Hogwarts, and Cho walked out to the little pub in Hogsmeade and wrote her name down on Hermione's list.I hope someone in the DA told Cho that she ought to have been in Gryffindor. I hope she laughed at them, hard. Integrity. Truth. Honor. Dedication. These were the tenets of her House, of the blue and the bronze, the eagle called raven (called nerd, called stuck-up, called so many things that were not their names). Bravery was only one way to be a hero.

  Moving to Beverly Hills was certainly an adventure like one of those in books Lilette Chase read. Now that she's here, she befriends three girls, but it's obvious they're hiding something. Something bigger than she could imagine. And then she has to find out who her father is. Yup, it certainly does sound like an adventure!
