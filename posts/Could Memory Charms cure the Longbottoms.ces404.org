Considering that Frank and Alice Longbottom were tortured into catatonia by the Cruciatus, a spell that does no physical damage but instead causes direct pain - by exciting the nervous system or through some sort of mental effect is never stated - could removing the memory of that pain conceivably cure their comatose status?


** If the cruciatus curse is actually described as causing no physical damage at all then hypothetically... maybe? If the reason they went insane is because the pain was too much then removing that pain from their minds should cure them in my opinion.

A hilarious idea just popped into my head, about Lockhart being the only one proficient enough at such detailed memory charms to cure them xD

*** My thought - and I'm far from a psychologist, so obviously grains of salt - is that the pain from the torture was so horrific that they basically /went away/ in their heads to escape from it. A sort of psychological retreat.

**** Probably a reasonable conclusion as well, however since this is Magic and fanfiction as well. If they went away into their heads to escape the pain, then you could pull off the cliché of a ”mindscape” (already rolling my eyes) and them being unable to leave their mindscape due to the horrific memory of the pain waiting for them outside. And since they have no perception of time in there, they are unaware that years go by and their son is growing up while they try to muster up the courage to face the pain.

Then if someone removed the memory of that pain, then they would have no reason to stay in their mindscape. They wouldn't even know why they went there in the first place. Thereby they would come out and essentially be cured.

(A lot of conjecture and made up stuff in that text for sure, but it's fun to imagine things lik that nevertheless)

*** I read a fic where Lockhart was hired by the Ministry to “rehabilitate” criminals with memory charms. The Longbottoms were cured with memory charms in that fic, but I don't think that would actually fix them. The way amputees sometimes feel pain from their phantom limb, the nervous system remembers.

** I always read it as though the Cruciatus had, essentially, caused them to disconnect mentally to avoid the pain. I think of it like cutting the cord on a pair of headphones that are blaring too-loud sound. The headphones stay on, but suddenly there's no audio coming through them, and because the cord was cut, the pathways that all other sounds would follow no longer exist.

I think it's an idea that could work if the legwork was done to explain why, in your universe, it's possible (and why nobody thought to try it sooner).

*** I think the simple reason no one tried it sooner can just be described as wizards being allergic to common sense and logic.

They never encountered this problem before. They knew there was no block for the curse. Someone comes in mentally damaged by the curse? They go “huh. Guess that's a new side effect we didn't know about. Since we don't have a real treatment for this except having them sleep it off and if it doesn't fix itself, oh well.”

** Thank you for this post. I had the same thought a few years back when i was trying to design a VR Harry Potter game, for no apparent reason since im not programmer. It does seem to fit with the lore of HP that you could obliviate the bad memories away, but maybe the memories were like a virus? taking over even the good memories til all that was left was the bad, and then they were stuck in the bad? The way to find out, in my opinion, would be to get a pensieve and extract the memories physically, kind of like blood under a microscope

*** That actually raises a different question, which is "does extracting memories for a pensieve remove those memories from the owner." I believe no, and feel this is backed up by canon; after all, how could Slughorn have altered the memory he gave to Dumbledore and still have had it to give to Harry later?

**** You're right wander, but i didn't mean to permanently remove them with the pensieve, just go through them to see where the bad memories intersect with the good ones in order to obliviate what's relevant...Think of the pensieve as the x-ray machine and the obliviator as the surgeon

** Depends on how the MC works and what Cruciatus damage is:

​

| Memory Charm works by:\Cruciatus Insanity is:                                                                                            | Damage to physical brain                                                                                    | Damage to magical brain or soul | Entirely mental trauma or similar |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------+-----------------------------------|
| Cutting off access to the memories                                                                                                       | Does not help.                                                                                              | Does not help.                  | Might help.                       |
| Erasing memories from physical brain but not magical brain or soul (assuming at least one of those two exists)                           | Might help, but only if the method of erasing replaces the brain tissue or reverts it to a pre-memory state | Does not help.                  | Possibly cures.                   |
| Erasing memories from physical brain and magical brain and soul (or neither of those exists or they don't have anything to do with this) | Might help, but only if the method of erasing replaces the brain tissue or reverts it to a pre-memory state | Might help.                     | Almost certainly cures.           |

​

​

However, since in canon Bertha Jorkin's Memory Charm was broken via torture, it almost certainly works as per row 1, which only even maybe helps if the entire effect is entirely mental.

​

Thus, unless there are other version of the MC that act to erase instead of obfuscate, or other methods that do so, this is a dead end.

However, note that Snape placed memories he did not wish to risk Harry seeing into his Pensieve. This implies that it is at least possible to mostly remove memories from one's mind by that method. In fact, this method was employed in the fic "A Wand for Skitter", a quite excellent Worm/Harry Potter crossover.

** Probably not. It's not the memories of the pain that is the problem... from what I can see they already don't remember much of anything. They went insane after being tortured for too long; the Dark magic has permanently damaged their minds. Modifying their memories wouldn't accomplish anything.

** It depends on where exactly the damage is.

If it's psychological, then removing the memory could help.

If it's actual damage to the magical mind or soul, then it might but probably not.

If it's the physical brain (neurons) that are damaged then it's possibly comparable to Huntington's or ALS, in which case memory charms won't help but a MRI might provide helpful information.

** I feel like it would be a no. My headcanon is that the cruciatus trips all your nerves with pain and that caused sensory overload(not sure this is right or not) and that's what made them insane. They felt too much and it was pain on top of that over a long enough period of time that it drove them insane. I look at it similar to the idea that if a person cant talk and loses all their senses then after a long enough time that person is going to go crazy.

** Memory charms have been shown to cause damage, e.g. muggles from book 4 showing negative affects after memory wipe after torture, so the damage from the memory charm would probably make things worse, not better. We also don't know how different magic affects the body; nerve damage, brain damage, or "soul" damage would have to get different treatments. If say the cruciatus only affected the soul or the nerves and obliviate only affected the brain, it's unlikely they'd be able to interact.

Sure, if you cut out the last 10 years of their lives, they wouldn't remember the torture, but they'd also be the people they were 10 years ago. What do you say? “Yea, hey, you were tortured into insanity and in order to get your minds back we had to reset you a bit. Just so you know, the war is over. Also, I know you don't remember it, but, Alice, you had a kid. He's going to Hogwarts now. Oh, and, before we forget, the year is 1991 and all those people you knew are dead, now.”
