The story would hopefully be about Harry growing up in his parents shadow while being targeted by werewolfs like greyback that are unhappy about the cure

Snape gets Contessa's Path to Victory power from Worm, which makes clear all the steps necessary to complete any task that can be accomplished. ([[https://parahumans.wordpress.com]])

** Not related to lily, but one I'm reading atm is called to shape and change, and it's got curing werewolves in it. I'm on mobile, I'll try remember to link later.

#+begin_quote
  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but the story did cry out for some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. HP/HG, SS/OC, not HG/SS. Rating & Genres may change later.
