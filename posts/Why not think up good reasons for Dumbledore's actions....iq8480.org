...instead of bashing or "just criticising" him?

Yeah sure, when you think it even a little, Dumbledore seems incredibly negligent at the best and manipulative at worst.

But we all know the real reason this happens is because plot. The series is about kids. If you let the most powerful and one of the wisest wizards in the series be competent, there is very little of plot left.

But that is true for a lot of things. Even Harry himself comes across horribly reckless and foolish many a times. But I don't see many people bashing him(nor do I want to).

I mean, there are literally over a thousand fics exist that somehow wants me to believe that Draco was a good guy. And just as many that wants me to believe Snape was somehow a good teacher and person. Even though canon explicitly shows them in a negative light, and not unintentionally like Dumbledore.

So why not come up with our own plot lines trying to make sense of Dumbledore's actions without turning him into a bad guy?


** I actually see canon Voldemort as the main problem, because if you just make Dumbledore slightly more competent and less negligent, as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11265467/1/Petrification-Proliferation][Petrification Proliferation]], the canon plot is solved.

Or like my [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/idxq3p/manipulativedumbledore_but_hes_actually/g2bz7hi/]['competent' Dumbledore piece]], he would not sit on his arse doing nothing for 10 years and dumping everything onto a child whom he threw into an abusive household before!

In order *not* to make Dumbledore a criminally negligent and senile plot device, a substantial rewrite of the canon is required, such as:

- The Dursleys are not bad. It's *completely inexcusable* for a wise person like Dumbledore to throw the hope of his nation into an abusive home and hope everything will turn out the best.
- Voldemort is far more rational, and not that monolithically evil Hollywood cartoon villain who is also a Crucio and Avada Kedvra addict.
- The Ministry is a lot sympathetic to Voldemort's cause than even its depiction in the Books. Only then can Dumbledore's apparent 'inaction' during that ten years be explained.
- Only if Ministry is really bad and uncooperative, can Dumbledore's 'mishandling' of Sirius be explained.
- The entire HBP and DH plot needs to be thrown away, because there is no way a responsible and wise leader can allow terrorist sabotage at a school full of children, just for the faint hope of turning that terrorist; because no reasonable leader can afford to just give minimal hints to 3 teenagers and hope for Deus Ex Machina, Author Fiats, Plot Armors, the Lucky Trope, and Dumbing Down Bad Guys into oblivion!

** I have never been bothered by Dumbledore's actions in canon. Sure he has been dumbed down for the sack of the plot (as most of the adults, . . . and sometimes the children), but in my opinion, there is always some justifications to his actions. Here are the excuses I use for his most . . . discutable actions :

- *Pre Hogwarts*\\
  In 1981, Dumbledore chose to place Harry with the Dursley because, while it was not a good option, it was the least bad one. It would have been very difficult for Harry to grow up in the magical world, between the angry Death Eater (who wanted to either kill him, or hail him as their new Dark Lord) and the ambitious politicians (who wanted to use his fame). Growing up Muggle ensured at least "some" normality (despite sleeping in a cupboard), and Mrs Figgs was placed near in case the Dursley went too far with Harry (which they apparently never did).\\
  I am convinced that if he had grew up and the Magical World (and survived), Harry would be nowhere near as well adjusted as in canon. The only 2 option I can see are "As paranoid as Moody" and "As arrogant as "the Twin" in every WBWL story".

- *PS*\\
  I think the Mirror was the only "true" protection for the stone, and that the only ones were only there as a decoy.\\
  Unless it is a kid with heroic tendencies, anyone who bothered passing all the protections was there to get the Stone, which means that this person can't get the Stone from the mirror and is now stuck in the last room. If Harry and his friends had not intervened, I'm sure Dumbledore would have still arrived minutes later to have a nice little chat with Quirell about his new Master, and if possible his current location (I don't think Dumbledore knew that Quirell was possessed).

- *CoS*\\
  In this case, I think Dumbledore was just unable to solve the mystery because, unlike Harry, he is not a Parselmouth.\\
  It's one thing to try to guess what kind of creature Slytherin Monster could be, it's another to have certitudes. Even Hermione was only able to guess that the monster was a Basilisk thanks to the voices Harry heard (which he never told Dumbledore about). There are probably several other kind of Monster which, while less likely than a Basilisk, were also potential culprits for the petrifications.\\
  As for the location of the CoS (or at least his entry), you also need a Parselmouth to open it. And unlike Ron, Dumbledore never slept next to a Parselmouth who talk in his sleep. Even if Dumbledore had found out that the entrance was probably in Myrtle lavatory, the monster moved in the pipes and there were probably other potential exit points, so it's not like he could just seal it. At least, this lavatory was abandonned and one of the most "secure" place for the Monster to leave without killing anyone.\\
  Also, Dumbledore had his hand tied by the fact that Hogwarts is a school. He couldn't put in place any heavier protections than what was already done without closing the school, which was Lucius objective all along.

- *PoA*\\
  Dumbledore truly didn't know about the change of Secret Keeper and really thought was Sirius betrayed them. He never went to see Sirius because there was nothing else to say after his "betrayal" and never push for him to have a trial because there was no point. After everything that had happened, there was no way Sirius would have been declared innocent after a trial. Even if he had asked to show his memory of to drink Veritaserum (which are the 2 arguments the most often used), it would only have taken one person to say "/It's suspicious how eager he is to do this. His Master must have taught him some tricks to cheat us/" and any testimony from Sirius would have been ignored.

- *GoF*\\
  Someone managed to enter Harry into the Tournament. But without knowing who it is, or what his motivations are, Dumbledore couldn't do anything. So the best plan was to let Harry participate in the Tournament until the enemy showed his hands, and to believe that the new Security measures that had been put in place would be enough to ensure Harry's survival.

- *OotP*\\
  Nothing to say there, Dumbledore explained his actions himself at the end of the book. I don't think he lied.

- *HBP*\\
  His hands were tied by the Unbrekable Vow. Severus, who was vitale for his plans and the finale victory, had swore to protect Draco (and finish the work in his place if needed). Any action against Draco took the risk to kill Severus, so he was forced to let Draco do as he pleased (or rather, was forced to) and pray that no other students would bie before the end of the year.\\
  While I'm on it, I also think that Severus didn't have any other choice than to swear the Vow. At this point, he is walking on thin ice as a Triple (or Quadruple?) agent, and Bellatrix openly distrust him. If he had refused to swear the vow, she would either have attacked him on the spot, or relay the scene to her Master, both outcome he wanted to escape, especially since he was trying to get Voldemort confidence.

â€‹

In the end, I think Dumbledore is an interesting character because, despite always working toward the Greater Good (as Doge said), he had some flaws. And as he said himself in CoS, since he is a man more intelligent than most, his mistakes have more consequences as well.

****** Not exactly. It would be very difficult sure, but luck and mischance could still push the trio into the war. The adults can still try and end up failing. But that would take competent writing and more importantly /world building/.

What we got instead was the adults being utterly incompetent and negligent /at best/, and the trio winning the war through luck and happenstance.

** Dumbledore's inaction is why I kind of despise him. (He is negligent, apathetic and even incompetent, really. I don't think it's even harsh to say that, a lot is expected of Harry as a child and then a teenager, when Dumbledore supposedly had the hability to do things and simply doesn't.)

That said, I really like how he is portrayed in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15465966/chapters/35902410][The Second String]], he is a bastard (as Aberforth says), but he does act, even if he is constrained by politics and circumstances.

I agree that Draco and Snape get a lot of forgiveness (that they don't even earn in a lot of fics) and are a lot more awful, though.

** I believe dumbledore bashing comes mostly because of that series of sentences that occur right after harry sees snapes memories during battle of hogwarts and starts feeling like Dumbledore used him, and I do think (Dumbledore himself admits) that Harry should have been told about the prophecy very early on, atleast when voldemort came back during Goblet of Fire.

As far as being manipulative is considered, there is some truth to this, however I don't think dumbledore ever forced harry to do anything other than that fiasco of goblet of fire or during his final moments in HBP where he asks harry to bring snape to him.

I do not blame Harry for being reckless or foolish, he is a child for god's sake. Harry could have walked out of all of the troubles he faced. But because of the kind of person he is, he chose to constanlty put himself in danger.

One thing thats unarguable is that Dumbledore is not evil. He might have used snape and harry, but I don't think Hogwarts would have lasted that long without Dumbledore's presence.

Because both are equally impossible. The good Malfoy/Snape stories have logic holes large enough to drive the Hogwarts Express through and in order to make Dumbledore not appear utterly incompetent at best, malevonent at worst, you need him to fix everything from Quirrel's leech over imposter Moody and the Basilisk to Malfoy committing war crimes in 10 minutes tops.

Which leaves you short of most non-romantic conflict if you remove Voldemort and all Death Eaters (including Snape and Malfoy), Umbridge, Lockhart, dementors, the Sirius/Pettigrew situation and so on.

** There was an interesting oneshot I read.

It turns out(in this continuity, anyway) that a lot of the suspicious actions of various individuals was the result of the Blood Wards around the Dursley residence being much more powerful than Dumbledore anticipated, and worked to protect themselves from anyone attempting to remove Harry from them permanently(going to school was fine, moving to another house wasn't). Basically everyone in the Order wanted to remove him from the Dursleys, but every time they tried, the Wards forced them to change their minds, so until Harry broke them, they were unable to take him away from them.

Ah yes, the attacks on Katie/Rosmerta and Slughorn/Ron/Harry are truly the mark of a gentle soul. You could cleary hear how much she enjoyed his tender actions as she was being tortured by whatever magic the amulet had. Or how Ron could breath so much better after that glass of deep-breath mead...

Remember, the intent follows the bullet. Or torture/killing device and poison in this case. If you were to write a list of all crimes we see committed in canon, Malfoy would be guaranteed the second place.

If you want to blame anyone for Draco's idiotic plans(other than Riddle), blame Albus. He knew full well Draco was ordered to kill him, and chose to do nothing, damn the collateral damage. That's a theme with Albus btw, he does not seem to care about Collateral damage, canon is full of those.
