Although I would like more to read one where the OC is a muggle, but if there is not, I'll be satisfied that it is well written.

Thank you!


** It's the second book in a series, but, /A Summer Like None Other/ has Draco fall in love with a muggle OC and go through a bit of an existential crisis along the way, eventually coming out the end a better person.

Harry is the main character in this series, but Draco is the secondary protagonist, and /A Summer Like None Other/ focuses mainly on him and his growth. It's quite good, and I would recommend it.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

** If you aren't entirely put off by slash or smut, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12614376][Werewolf Discourse, OR: Nicolas Pereyra's Coffee Shop for Dipshit Cryptids]] is absolutely fantastic. It's hilarious and not ooc and plotty and very well written.
