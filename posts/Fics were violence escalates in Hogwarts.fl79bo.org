We can see the possibility of bad things happening in the books: students hexing each other before quiditch matches, pranks going too far like with the kid that was shoved in the vanishing cabinet, dumb kids trying unknown spells on enemies(sectusempra) incident.

And all this in a pretty toxic environment: houses are segregated and hostile, teachers seem to be overworked, incompetent or both, children carry weapons, bullying is definitely a thing, discrimination is pretty rampant and most kid's parents were fighting each other in a bloody civil war a decade ago.

I read one fic were Neville berserk, but you'd think shit would hit the fan on a regular base.


** Linkffn(Bowling for Hogwarts)

The story is basically a reporter taking interviews in the aftermath of the violence in Hogwarts, rather than the violence itself.

  Time and time again the Bad Guys do bad things and get away with it. Time and time again the Good Guys take the low blow and just soldier on with their upper lips stiff. What might happen if someone couldn't hold it together? How would Magical Britain react? More to the point; who would they blame? A little One-Shot in documentary style.

** God damn, I swear to God that I read a fic where Harry literally blows Draco's head off with a bombarda spell after he (Draco) disemboweled Luna when exiting the RoR. She gets put under s stasis spell to keep her alive while Harry finishes Draco off. I remember Dumbledore doing a purification ritual in his office after that, but I can't remember the name of the fic to save my life.

** I (barely) remember a fic in which Harry and Cho (others joined later I guess) were doing brutal interrogations/torture sessions and killings, all the while doing drugs to not think about what they've done and still to do. At some point Harry decides to stop using drugs but Cho doesn't like that at least initially. I think at one point they've rescued a bunch of muggles from one of the D.E.'s houses.

Anyway I don't remember its name and will look for it but while I do so, if anyone knows this fic, do share its name please.

Edit: I looked but unfortunately couldn't find it.

** This post is an exact description of what goes on in Silirt's current series, starting with /The Boy Who Died./ Linkffn(12955401)

Students basically divide into factions, try to control information about each other, and things gradually escalate from there to cursing each other and taking hostages, though some of them seem to be trying to keep things from escalating.

"of cause bullying is fine, the slytherins do it, and none of the teachers stop it, so that means we can do it too"

*** I don't know if I've read that one yet, but I guess you could say that: lack of thrust in authority+motivation and opportunity to take action yourself could lead to law and order falling apart. Especially if after the first violent clashes aren't competently handled.

Maybe a bit like starfox's stories, but not quite on the civil war scale and with the story actually taking place at Hogwarts.

I'll check out the fic though, cuz it does ring a bell but I don't really remember.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
