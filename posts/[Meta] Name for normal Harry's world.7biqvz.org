I feel like there should be a name for canon Harry's world beyond, canon world, like in Harry Potter & the distaff side Harry leaves his original "canon" world to go to a world were genders are reversed, there should be a better name than canon world for the original world What do you guys think though?


** I prefer not to change their parental generation's genders, because that would change the plot too much.

Harry - Likely a flower name such as Iris, Jasmine, and Violet

Hermione - Leontes (or Leon), male main character of [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Winter%27s_Tale][The Winter's Tale]]

One of my head canon says that Weasleys kept having more children until they had a girl. Vice versa, they might keep going until they finally had a boy. The names of their children seemed to originate from English or Germanic royalties. Ginevra was obviously their choice for the eldest daughter. Anne, Catherine, Charlotte, Elizabeth, Mathilda(!), and Victoria could be possibilities for their other daughters. William should be the name of their only son.

*** i think OP meant a name for the 'canon' HP world. So instead of saying this harry is form the 'canon world' he'd be from Canon-land or some such.

*** *The Winter's Tale*

The Winter's Tale is a play by William Shakespeare originally published in the First Folio of 1623. Although it was grouped among the comedies, some modern editors have relabelled the play as one of Shakespeare's late romances. Some critics consider it to be one of Shakespeare's "problem plays" because the first three acts are filled with intense psychological drama, while the last two acts are comedic and supply a happy ending.

The play has been intermittently popular, revived in productions in various forms and adaptations by some of the leading theatre practitioners in Shakespearean performance history, beginning after a long interval with David Garrick in his adaptation Florizel and Perdita (first performed in 1753 and published in 1756).

*** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Distaff Side) Male!Hermione was named Orestes. Fem!Harry is named Harriet, and some of the names just get weird. /Thubani/ Malfoy, anyone?

And a major part of the worldbuilding and plot is that the gender roles are reversed, which also turns canon!Harry into an wildcard that is consistently underestimated.

And then he wipes the floor with a corrupt Auror using a skill that had only been seen with witches of Dumbledore and Riddle's level.

** In tv-shows i have encountered earth-1 and origin world (ORG-world?) And of course the usual homeworld/homeuniverse

But i guess i prefer the term homeworld, as the word home implies emotional attachment to the world you grow up on.

** Literally nothing wrong with the phrase "in canon". It's short, clearly defined, and well-known. What would be the point in coming up with another word to mean the same thing?

*** Because in character, people don't talk about "canon world", and even in a description, it's jarring. "Harry remembered how canon Dean used to be a fan of football." simply doesn't fit well. "Harry remembered how the Dean from his home world..." is a little better, but gets old after a while.

In Worm, they talk about "Earth-Bet" since they know about four parallel Earths. Marvel has the Earth-616 terms.
