So recently I've been listening to the books on Audible as another way to experience the books (Its pretty awesome btw) and a few things have stood out to me that the fan fiction community kind of just takes a thing that happened. One of them is the fact that Sirius was a lady's man in his youth and adulthood. Mind you I'm only on Book 4 of the reread, but from my knowledge of the books this was never a thing. Yet in several fanfics where Sirius raises Harry or He stays out of Azkaban He comes off as a lady's man. He either tells stories of his 'conquests' from Hogwarts or shows the traits in some way. He was a prankster; Yes, and a bit of a jerk, but he never had the lady's man style at least in my opinion he did not. Anyone know where this came from?

**** Yeah, I think it was an excuse needed to make Sirius that character in stories, more than something that was supported by canon. And since fanfiction was traditionally written by young women, the bad boy rebel with a heart of gold would be a popular trope that would endure over other characterizations of Sirius.

Think of it like the Draco in Leather Pants trope: totally unsupported by canon, yet by far the most prevalent depiction of Draco in fandom

** I think it was a natural extrapolation from the fact that the Marauders are very popular during Hogwarts. Remus was unlikely to date, as evidenced by his using his lyncathropy as (one of many, to be fair) an excuse with Tonks. Pettigrew doesn't seem like the type to be popular with the ladies, and James was hung up on Lily. It's fairly easy to see (making those assumptions/extrapolations) that Sirius would be a ladies man as the only “available” one of the Marauders. Plus, he ran away from his family so he has that bad boy/rebel thing going on. Considering the tropes of romantic movies, he would automatically be assumed to be a ladies man.

*** I went back through that passage and couldn't find anything about Sirius winking at girls. To the contrary, we do get a line about "a girl sitting behind him was eyeing him hopefully, though he didn't seem to have noticed."

The only thing resembling real evidence of that characterization is when, in DH, we find out that Sirius's room had "several posters of bikini-clad Muggle girls" on the walls. Can anyone else speak to whether or not this trope predated the release of DH?

Yeah, it did. It was common even in the very early days: The rule-flaunting nature of becoming an illegal Animagus but using it to support a cursed friend, sneaking about to create the Marauder's Map with its cheeky personality, the audacity to escape Azkaban and stop at nothing to kill Wormtail, and finally how he offered himself as a pseudo-Father to Harry.

It was a recipe for fanfiction gold.

** I'll just quote my post from last year.

#+begin_quote
  It's an inference (that he went out with a lot of girls) and a logical one at that. He was young, from an Ancient & Noble family, a rebel, he ran with his own crew, he played jokes and presumably, he was good at magic & attractive. Now if we ask the question "Would a young Sirius Black use all those things to bed as many girls as possible?", I think the answer is a resounding yes. The glimpses we get in the books show a pattern of little inhibition, poor impulse control and generally a passionate disposition. AND he was a teenage male on top of that. He had it and he (most likely) used it.

** I was told--though I haven't seen it myself--that Rowling had written something on Pottermore where Remus described Sirius as 'getting all the girls'. I'm not convinced by that myself, but he is, I think, the only character who is described in Canon in a rather sexualised way. Rowling used a lot of the sorts of descriptive cliches you see in romantic novels. She didn't do that with anyone else. I think she was writing someone out of her system.

** Honestly, there are a lot of tropes that make no sense, like the Marauders being pranksters. Is there any evidence for Sirius and James playing pranks at all? The only thing we have is that they loathe Snape and humiliate him once after the end of their fifth year exams. And from what Lupin and Sirius say about their times at school, Snape gave as good as he got - which means James and Sirius aren't necessarily the "evil bullies" that so many make them out to be. Snape also likes cursing muggleborns for laughs as we see in his memories, so James and Sirius easily could have been getting back at him for something like that.

Instead, so many authors write a self-righteous prick!HP ranting about how he hates bullies and shit.

*** Well the Marauders were said to be a lot like Fred and George and didn't McGonagall remember them playing pranks and stuff, so that is where the prankster-line is coming from. But lets face it with things like this Rowling is more tell than show. (For example, we never see Snape improve a potion, we only read his improved recipes, but we never see any of that in action.)

Snape was definitely a bully as well and just because Lily had a blind spot for it, doesn't change that fact.

**** Fred and George are talented, but I think that the Marauders were on another level. They became animagi at 15, enchanted the Marauder's Map around the same age, enchanted a motorbike to fly (or at least, Sirius did - and we know that magic and muggle tech do NOT mix at all). James and Lily were skilled enough to duel and escape Voldemort three times (and I'm assuming that LV in the first war wasn't as incredibly nerfed as he was in the second one).

You could say that the potion he forcefeeds Dumbledore after he puts on the ring was one of Snape's creations.

He's not just a bully, he's a Death Eater who switched sides only because LV decided to go after the woman he'd be lusting on for a decade. If LV went after the Longbottoms or any other family other than the Potters, Snape would not have switched sides.

And he and James are depicted as the popular jocks in canon, very much the kind to inspect broom cupboards with classmates of the female persuasion.

Better than making him and Remus not so closeted homosexuals, which /is/ contradicted by canon.

Actually they aren't depicted as anything in canon. We know very little about them as canon really. We know they were pranksters, James was on the quidditch team, and they picked on Snape.
