...and admits to Arthur that she cheated on him and had all of their children with other men except for Ron. It's mostly Ron-bashing. I googled keywords into Google and pulled up nothing, though I remember the story being fairly popular. Halp! I wanted to read it again because I remember it being really funny.


** It's been a while but if I remember right there was a sort of deleted scene like that in Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.

** It's the other way around (Arthur cheating on Molly), but I still like it very much. linkao3([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12596508/1/Petunia-s-Letter]]) and its sequels.
