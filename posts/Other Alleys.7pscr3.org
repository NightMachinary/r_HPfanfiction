Diagon Alley and Knockturn Alley are, of course, canon, but what others have you seen in fanfics that worked well? I've seen Parshi Alley, Soci Alley, but I'm looking for other ideas.


** In case you're interested, I took a different approach after discovering that "diegol" is Old English for "secret". I basically bastardised Old English words into similar sounding modern counterparts. And if such words are close to puns, I just make the leap over~ I jotted that bit down in a notebook so it might take me a while to find it again XD

If you have the patience, you could look up a word list ending in -ally and pick and choose from there.

** I've used Cashew Alley. Has a bunch of cafes and hat shops and such.

I've considered having a red-light district called Bisect-U Alley, but I felt it was a bit ham-handed.

  Young Harry liked numbers, he liked using numbers and working out the value of things. When he found out that he was a wizard and had a big pile of gold... well, he had something new to calculate. oneshot, complete, don't own.

** Horizont Alley and Carkitt Market are side-streets to Diagon Alley in canon according to the wiki.

Rebirth of the Founders has Spiritu Alley, which is entirely places of worship, and Supernature Alley.

** I mean, they don't even need to be alleys. Just take a descriptor for the buildings or stores on that street, use some bastardisation of its Latin or Old English or French or Gaelic form or whatever, then add some kind of street to it.

** I'm pretty sure it's not real, but I once read about one in America called Whimsic Alley... I've used it when I was writing a MCU/Harry Potter crossover (Pepper was a witch, and was also related to the Weasley's (I didn't work out how though, but she was Aunt Pepper to the Weasley kids so she was either Molly's or Arthur's sister)).

Just looked it up, it was a real shop that is now closed.

***** That's fine.

I was interested in Pepper somehow connected to the Wizarding World since I recently read a fic where Pepper was the real mother of Fred and George while the Twins were adopted to the Weasley family. Took place after the Deathly Hallows so George found out alone. It's intriguing premise.
