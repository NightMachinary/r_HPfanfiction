** /(I've written a similar scene for an upcoming fic, slightly different to your prompt [my Sirius and Regulus have a strained relationship but were, until this point, still close])/

The evening hadn't exactly been what one might call a roaring success, but nobody had ended up cursed or disowned or dismembered. It could have ended up much worse, and Regulus was thankful for small mercies.

He had changed into his pyjamas and was penning a letter to Thorfinn to tell him all about it when he heard the sound of heavy boots stomping up the stairs. He darted to his bedroom door and opened it just in time to see Sirius slam his own door shut. Regulus waited until the sounds of swearing and kicking and crashing had abated before he knocked.

“What?!”

“It's me,” Regulus said quietly. “Can I come in?”

“No!”

Regulus tried the door handle. It wasn't locked and he hadn't suffered some awful jinx just from touching it so he deemed it safe enough to enter. He stopped just inside the room and closed the door quietly behind him.

Sirius's bedroom was even messier than it usually was. Half his pillows had been ripped apart, their fwooper feather fillings still drifting to the floor, like the aftermath of a colourful carnival parade. The carpet was strewn with various scraps of parchment, photographs, spilt ink, and what looked like Regulus's broom servicing kit. He frowned; he could see from his position in the doorway that Sirius hadn't put the tweezers back into their correct compartment.

More frightening still was the fact that Sirius appeared to be packing his trunk, even though they weren't due back at Hogwarts for another week and a half.

“What are you doing?” Regulus asked.

“What does it look like?” Sirius snapped. He stood in front of his wardrobe, wildly tossing jumpers and shirts and those strange, stiff trousers into his trunk.

“It looks like you're packing your trunk,” Regulus said as lightly as he could manage, trying to hold back the panic swelling in his chest like a river after a storm. “But you usually leave that until the very last minute and it's only Christmas Eve.”

“I'm not packing for Hogwarts.”

“Oh. Are you going away for Christmas?”

Sirius snorted. “You could say that.”

He was at his desk now, yanking drawers open and shoving them closed again. Searching for something.

“May I come?” Regulus asked.

Sirius stilled. He rested his palms on the desk and leaned forwards, his shoulders hunched, his messy dark hair concealing his face. Regulus took a step towards him.

“You could,” Sirius said tightly, “but I don't think you'd like it.”

“Where are you going?”

“Away from here.”

Sirius spun around and shoved a book into Regulus's hands. It was the NEWT-level Transfiguration text he had been searching for in the family library a few days ago. What was /Sirius/ doing with an old textbook?

“What do you mean, away from here?” he asked, his voice quiet. The air in the room had grown cold, as though a dementor were lurking outside the window.

“Do you want to know what Mother waited until /after/ her little party to talk to me about? Do you want to know what she's been planning while we've been away at school?” Sirius said. He leaned against his desk and folded his arms across his chest. “Our darling mother doesn't want me to go back to Hogwarts in January. She thinks my friends are a bad influence on me. Did you know she's been screening my post? Burning anything that happens to come from anyone outside the /family/?”

Regulus had thought she had stopped doing all that. “I---”

“‘Course you didn't. S'not like she's ever needed to check up on /you/, perfect little Regulus,” Sirius said bitterly. “She wants me to turn my back on the /mongrels/ and /blood-traitors/ and make nice little pureblood friends like yours.”

“So you're just... going...?” Regulus asked, disbelieving. It all seemed a bit, well, drastic.

“If I don't go now she'll trap me here forever.”

*** He sounded so matter-of-fact. But he couldn't mean it. Sirius and Walburga had arguments like this all the time - and this hadn't even been a /bad/ argument, not by their standards. No one had been hurt. Sirius had been bruised and bleeding and angry and embarrassed but never wanted to leave before. Never wanted to leave so much that he'd started packing his belongings.

Yet at the first suggestion that he might have to give up James Potter and the rest, Sirius was going. Sirius was abandoning his brother. His /real/ brother.

“You can't---”

“Can't what, leave?” said Sirius, scoffing. “It's been done before.”

“But--- you're the /heir/.”

“I don't care! It doesn't mean anything - you think anyone outside of this bloody family cares about shit like that?”

“You don't have to just /go/!”

“Why not? Andromeda didn't belong in this family, and I don't either. You know that.”

“But... if you just...” Regulus looked around the jumbled room, desperately searching for something, anything, that he might be able to say or do that would stop Sirius from running. He was the only thing left standing between his brother and the Outside and Regulus knew - he just /knew/ - that once Sirius took his first step out into the frosty night air, that would be it. He would be gone, forever.

Sirius rolled his eyes. “Just what, Reg? Enlighten me.”

“If you just apologise---”

“Apologise for what?!”

“I mean---”

“Fucking hell, Reg. What the fuck do you think I should apologise for?” Sirius was fuming, rising up from his desk to pace around his bedroom. “For having friends who don't think muggle-baiting is a fun weekend activity? For not believing in the Most Ancient and Bloody Bullshit House of Black? For being a Gryffindor? Because that's where this all started, isn't it? They just couldn't /stand/ that I wasn't a shit-head Slytherin like the rest of them.”

/Like the rest of/ */you./*

“You're still their favourite,” Regulus said quietly, looking down at the ink-stained carpet.

“Are you--- are you as fucking deranged as they are?” Sirius shouted, throwing his hands up in the air in frustration. “They /hate/ me!”

“They don't, they---”

“Listen,” Sirius said, lowering his voice. He strode forwards and grabbed Regulus by the shoulders, forcing him to meet his eyes. “You need to get it into your thick skull that those bloody inbred maniacs don't give a shit about either of us. They never fucking have. All we are to them is a line on their precious tapestry. That's it. They don't care about what we like, what we want, what we /feel/. This isn't a family, Reg. It's not even a dynasty. This is /hell/.”

Sirius gripped Regulus's shoulders tightly, his fingers digging in so hard that Regulus was sure he would have bruises in the morning. Sirius gave him a brisk shake as if that might help get the message through, and when he released him Regulus staggered back a pace. Sirius strode over to the window, heaved his trunk up and pushed it out into the night sky.

Regulus lurched forwards. “Wait--- /we're/ a family!” he said desperately. “/I/ care about you, I care about what you like and what you feel! I--- I'm your /brother/!”

Sirius climbed up onto the windowsill and looked back at Regulus over his shoulder, his hand braced against the dark wooden frame. His shoulders seemed to sag as he slowly shook his head. “It's not enough, Reg.”

*/You're/* /not enough./

Sirius jumped.

Regulus staggered over to the window and watched the brother he had looked up to and idolised his entire life get up, unharmed, from a flower bed four stories below. He blinked back tears as he watched Sirius pick up his trunk and stride out to the alleyway running alongside the house, his collar turned up against the bitter December wind.

Sirius never looked back.

It was hours later, lying awake in the middle of Sirius's bed and clutching his Transfiguration textbook to his chest, that Regulus realised. He realised that Sirius must have cast a particularly powerful cushioning charm to survive a fall from that height unharmed. He realised that Sirius must have had this whole thing planned. For months, perhaps. Or even years.
