Looking for a story, I believe I read a long time ago with Fred and George ending up in another world. Maybe because of one of their joke shop items went wrong or something?

Been trying to find it for ages, I'm almost sure it was a story and not something I made up. Any help would be appreciated!

From what I remember slaves were allowed and Fred and George found Hermione and bought her because they were afraid for her safety. (Or something to that affect).


** This one.

The writing isn't great, but I think it is readable.

*** Yes! I believe that's it! Thank you, been searching for it forever. Really appreciate it so much. Shame, doesn't look like it's completed though. But thank you!

*** Huh. Interesting concept, but I'm afraid to read it. Can you give me a synopsis?

**** I don't remember much, expect Dumbledore and Grindelwald are disappointingly 1d evil. The plot's okay, I guess. There's this big war, and the Weasley kids all go through some sort of redemption arc.

** Mm...I don't know the one in particular you're thinking of, but Scattered Over Middle Earth, one of a collection of one-shots, has a whole bunch of characters...well, being sent to Middle Earth. And Fred is amongst them.
