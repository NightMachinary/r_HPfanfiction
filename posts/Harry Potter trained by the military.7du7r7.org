Anyone know of any good fics where Harry gets trained by the British military Alex Rider style? I imagine that if stories like that do exist, they probably start of somewhere around 4th year.

**** It's got several grammatical errors, and a few cliches (though relatively minor--Daphne Greengrass is considerably fleshed out), but there's a level of earnestness that will keep you reading.

*** I personally didn't like this one, too much muggle wank. Also, Harry's personality grated on my nerves

  Even muggles notice thousands dead, and Margaret Thatcher had the help of one Sergeant Prewett of Her Majesty's Special Air Service. Harry Potter is taken in by a loving family, and raised to become the hero of both worlds. Even as he enters Hogwarts looking for friends, he is confronted by the darkness in the wizarding world. First year complete, second year starting April 2017.

** If it doesn't have to be Harry, I've written "Divided and Entwined", where Hermione founds a resistance group and gets training from mercenaries in the use of small arms. (Harry and Ron get training too, but only much later in the story - until then, their training is done by Sirius and Remus.)

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

*** It doesn't! Harry was the first one that came to my mind because I posted that right after I saw that there was a new Alex Rider book which I used to read a lot when I was younger.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.
