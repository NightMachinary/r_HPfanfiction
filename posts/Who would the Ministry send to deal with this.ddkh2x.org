*Premises:*

Hogwarts as a neutral meeting ground for three organisations who are in conflct concerning one person, the Main Character. These organisations are the French Ministry of magoc, the British Ministry of magic, and the paranormal investigations agency that the MC works for.

The MC:

- is an obscurial. Both magical governments already have a kill-on-sight policy toward such individuals.

And

- has definitely killed two aurors, one French the other British (allegedly in self-defense), and maimed or grievously injured at least a couple more.

The French Ministry of magic also believes the MC is responsible for six extra deaths, although there are no witnesses for those.

The paranormal investigations agency will tend to favour the MC, obviously, but also reject the authority of two states that the MC was never a citizen of.

=> So you have a situation where it looks like there is a very dangerous and volatile monster on the loose, but also a high risk of breaching the Statute of Secrecy (which is already compromised).

*Question:* Which officials would the magical governments send? Would the Minister himself turn up? Umbridge? Or just the chief Auror?

*Edit:* */this is not a fight!/* This is a parley situation, a negociation, trying to get out of gridlock. You can't just send a Dementor and have done with it. The whole point is you have two magical organisations who are convinced, perhaps wrongly, that the MC is dangerous, and a non-magical organisation who are determined not to let the MC go.


** You see, you only parley when you have something to gain. Before a battle you might try to negotiate in order to keep your own troops alive. But your MC has nothing the MoMs could gain. Especially if he's wanted for murder (witnesses are irrelevant because they are the most unreliable form of evidence).

So dementor it is, and there is nothing Dumbledore could do to intervene. After all, he couldn't even protect an innocent man from the minister's execution squad and had to get two teenagers to do it for him.

** A Dementor.

In a Dementor vs Obscurial fight, my money is on the Dementor.

** I don't understand. You have a obscurial, a very dangerous person, who both governments believe is a murderer, to the point where they have initiated a kill on sight policy. And the MC is threat to the Statute of Secrecy. Why would the ministry want to talk to such a person? Why wouldn't they just send dementors?

What kind of sway does this paranormal investigations agency have that they would force two magical governments to parley with the MC?

*** All right. I didn't think this would require spilling most of the plot but here goes.

The MC is french, has mild superhuman ability separate from magic, and has been managing their obscurus for several years: each month a safe, hidden location is assigned them to go wreak havoc without risk of harm to others or detection. The MC has a job with this muggle agency, which has ties to the french secret service, and one day, they finds a magic wand during an investigation. It triggers the obscurus, they slip up, and the Aurors finally notice. It is assumed (wrongly) that the MC is responsible for the deaths of six people who died that day, and whose cause of death is broadly unidentifiable beyond that it was violent and quick.

A string of events later, the MC arrives at Hogwarts. The agency tracks them down, joins them at Hogwarts, and threatens to spill the beans about magic if the wizards won't play ball. The problem can't be got rid of with mass obliviations, because too many people on the muggle side have already been affected and left material evidence in multiple places and mediums. Simply liquidating this individual is no longer an option because too many questions would be left behind for people whose job it is to answer strange questions.

(Dementors: yes I see your point, everyone, but I choose not to use them. My excuse is either that the MoMs wouldn't do it, based on the ending of /Fantastic Beasts/ nÂ°1, or the dementors are insufficiently trustworthy or too difficult to control).

I just wanted your opinions, folks, on what sort of people would come to a parley? Who would you send to convince the muggles that the person they are protecting is actually dangerous? Who would you send who could be trusted to keep quiet about it? Who would you send who whose judgement you would trust to say whether this supposedly dangerous person really is dangerous or just a victim of circumstance?

**** Probably the head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, someone from the Improper Use of Magic Office (since they deal with threats to the Stature of Secrecy), someone from the Muggle Liaison Office, someone from the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures (assuming of course that obscurials fall under their jurisdiction), someone from the Department of International Magical Cooperation (since multiple governments are involved), and maybe someone from the Department of Mysteries. In addition, there would probably be Hit Wizards providing security.

** +They would send Barty Crouch Sr, he as a powerful wizards and Head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation and former Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, would be by far the most suitable the ministry official.+

Edit: I changed my mind and agree with Taure, a Dementor would be the best choice.
