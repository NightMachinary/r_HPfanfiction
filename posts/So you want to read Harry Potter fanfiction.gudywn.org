** Probably could do without the fic recommendations section, which is very much shaped my OP's personal preferences and contains a lot of niche fics not really suitable for someone's first foray into fanfic. Like, recommending Harry/Voldemort to someone who is just being introduced to fanfic is just going to confirm all of the worst stereotypes about fanfiiction.

Edit: also, you added gen and het incorrectly. It's about romantic content, not smut. A T rated Harry/Ginny fic with no smut would still be het, because it contains a heterosexual romance. Similarly, gen refers to fics with no romance.

**** Well, the fact that "slash" has been used for gay pairings in fanfiction for 25 years+ should be proof enough. And even without that, there are hundreds of requests every month in this sub that say something like "Looking for romantic fics, no slash please" or "Looking for Harry/OC, no slash please". How do you understand those requests? Like "Looking for pairing, no pairing pls"?

** The misunderstanding about "slash" also leads to two important lingos missing: gen and het.

Gen means that a fic contains no romantic or sexual content.

Het means that the fic contains straight romantic or sexual content. So the straight equivalent to a "slash" tag.

To answer the question about the NSFW tag: the post got auto-flaired, because you mentioned the word "smut".

** Honestly, it seems like you need to be more well-versed yourself before trying to do an introduction for someone else. And that list of recs is a big yikes. I wouldn't recommend robst or megamatt to my worst enemies, and psuedo-intellectual bullshit like poison pen and MoR will completely shift their expectations of the fandom in a negative way. How many people come to this subreddit claiming MoR is the best fic they've ever read, yet its practically the only fic they've ever read since they spend all their time arguing about it rather than reading actual good fics.

** Your preferences shine through too much:

- when you list short names for ships, it would be probably courteous to start with Hinny and at least present Harmony and Huna, (edited in later) and Romione, of course; sorry, Ron, I forgot you again :(.

- your examples of fanon are probably too controversial: yes, there is a large group of people who read Heiress Greengrass stories (or even outright Haphne), and yes there is large set of stories where the Wizarding Britain is ruled by aristocracy, but it is quite certainly not that universally accepted as some true fanons (just now reading linkffn(8076284), which I think it quite well known story, and my first Daphne Greengrass was from linkffn(3912184;4236594) and that is quite certainly not the Heiress Greengrass). E.g., there are no wards and notice-me-not charms every mentioned in the canon (and they have nothing to do with Ancient Runes), but I haven't heard anybody providing any alternative. Or Gringotts doing anything else than strictly banking (that's probably more controversial when going overboard). Or Arithmancy is anything more than predicting the future. Perhaps, Snape is Draco's godfather is also more widely accepted (not sure about this one).

** That's a really good guide imo! You could perhaps ditch the recommendations or just link to a Google Doc page where you store your recommendations. It'll save up a lot of space in your post.

You could also add a small explanation for Genres like what to expect from them when it comes to HP fanfictions. i.e: Angst (what type of fics usually use this tag) or Hurt/Comfort and etc.

Overall it's a really helpful and comprehensive guide imo. Perhaps you could update it with more terms for common tropes that aren't easily understood.
