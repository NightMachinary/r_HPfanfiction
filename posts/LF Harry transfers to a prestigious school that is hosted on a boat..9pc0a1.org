Hey everyone I've looked everywhere for this but for the life of me can't find it. Basically Harry works his ass off in order to transfer to a school that's hosted on a boat it's a really prestigious school and only takes the best, so harry works his ass off during the tournament fourth year there might be a time turner and there might be a tent in the chamber of secrets with Sirius and Remus living in it. Any help would be much appreciated! Edit: while I continue to try and find this I've remember it was set during GoF and was less about Harry attending and more the trials it took for him to get accepted in pretty sure the story ends with him being accepted into the school at the end of the tournament.

*** Huh Well that's it. My brain must have changed it a lot in trying to remember it definitely don't remember Harry being such an annoying brat lol. Thanks a bunch I would never have even looked at this one because my memory of the fic is so different.
