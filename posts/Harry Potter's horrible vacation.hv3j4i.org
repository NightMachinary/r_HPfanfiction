Harry, fresh out of finishing school, decides to travel the world and find himself while maybe getting to be an absolute tourist and not have to constantly worry about dark wizards trying to kill him.

Naturally, the universe decides "To hell with that" and seems to have the desperately not wanting any trouble Harry blunder into one situation after another where he ends up defeating a dark lord or dismantling some criminal organization.

"Did Voldemort curse me or something!?" Harry cries as he slays what has to be the third lich while also saving the sixth princess he's come across since he left Britain.

"I just want to have a peaceful vacation!" he yells over the sounds of spells being cast at him from all directions by the latest Magical Mob he's ran into.

"This is just getting silly!" he cries as he badly plays a guitar in a musical duel against a creature that looks like the devil.


** So, basically Make a Wish 2: Electric Boogaloo? I like it. :D

**** Ah, okay. Hmm. I think the closest things I know to what you're looking for are the 'people trying to find Harry' fics. They're definitely not what you're looking for, since they tend to focus on the people searching for Harry while he does those blundering-into-situation thing.

So, they're less:

"This is just getting silly!" he cries as he badly plays a guitar in a musical duel against a creature that looks like the devil.

-And more:

"Is that... Harry?" Hermione cries, as she looks at the front page Prophet picture of a dark haired man playing guitar against what looked like a bloody Devil.

Sorry. Those're the closest I've got. I don't think I've really seen anyone take a proper stab at the Make a Wish formula (and for anyone else reading the thread, Make a Wish link below). I can post them if you want, but they're not really what you're looking for.
