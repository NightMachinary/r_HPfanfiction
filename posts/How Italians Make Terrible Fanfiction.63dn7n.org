**** There's a meme of sorts going around the internet of [[http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/how-italians-do-things]["how Italians do things."]] I even saw Italian artist Fabio Rovazzi making fun of it on his instagram a few weeks ago. This is pretty much an extension of this, as it's placing the hand on the cover of a "terrible fanfiction."

*** I never said he was italian, the joke is that the hand gesture is inherently italian, you photoshop it onto something and say "This is how italians do ___". It's the meme.
