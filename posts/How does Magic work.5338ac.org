I have a few theories, but I want to see what you come up with.

Here is what I have.

Quantum Theory, or more Specifically Quantum probability, states that there is a a small probability that something can happen without the use of energy. For example, imagine a wall. You are on the other side of this wall. Quantum Probability basically states that there is a small probability for you to be on the other side of the wall. The thing in Harry Potter they like to call "Magic" could just be the ability to change Quantum Probability.

A second theory, is that "Magic" has the ability to change the Atomic Number (Protons n all that) of the atoms in Air. For example, whatever the atomic number of whatever makes up the levitation charm. Magic could be the ability to change the atoms into something that effects the world. Maybe for the Cheering charm, it creates a laughing gas with transparent properties, and is attracted only to the specific person.

The last theory isn't my favorite.

What do you guys think?

EDIT: I am not looking for idiots. If you don't have a theory, don't bother to comment. It's annoying and useful.


** Given the proven existence of a soul in HP-verse, my interpretation is based on the allegory of the cave : we are souls, tied in our bodies while alive; the physical world is but the shadows one can see, and magic users are those whose hands are free to make a shadow play.

Searching for a "scientific" explanation to magic (something that is never done in canon), is in my mind an error, for two reasons; on one side, a scientific explanation takes the magic out of the magic (you can create a laughing gas? great, so can I, I just need a chem lab); on the other, the fact that the magical world is still hidden around 2017 (epilogue) means that satellites cannot see Hogwarts, that not a single city planner find weird the hole in London where Diagon alley is, the existence of the fidelius means that information can be manipulated on a global scale (and without caring for distance nor specie). Magic does not manipulates probabilities nor matter, it manipulates reality and/or the perception of reality.

*** You clearly don't understand what I ment with probability. Quantum Probability works perfectly with this- The fidelus charm for example. It changes the probability of everyone forgetting where the location is, with the exception of a few people. For satellites, the probability of them not being able to see it increases. However, I do thank you for actually responding without idiotic ramblings of science "Blowing up" when magic is near.

**** Oh I do understand what are probabilities (and the basis of quantum mechanics, if one can be said to understand any of it). My point was that even with that the notion of a soul cannot be explained. And that I rather like when magic is magical, when it has more to do with the wonder of a child than with that of a scientist.

****** I think your missing his point. He's pointing out that HP canon allows for the existence of souls (or at least some persistence of the human consciousness after death). Therefore any theories must allow for that.

Now, blending the quantum mechanics theory with multiple dimensions (spatial, not Multiverse or Parallel dimensions) could allow for something plausible.

Say that the wizard condition allows access to a higher dimension(s), and manipulation of energy or probability states in this higher dimension might trickle down to the 4-space we occupy normally.

Now perhaps continuous access to this dimensional plane leaves a residual energy imprint, which can allow (or cause) a persistence when death is cause by a traumatic event.

As for something like time travel, again, if time and space are the lower four dimensions, perhaps translation in the upper dimensions can cause a displacement only in the temporal dimension.

I can understand the gp post's sentiment regarding the wonder of magic, but I feel that a scientific explanation can be equally amazing and wondrous, but maybe I'm biased as an engineer with physics background. The very nature of our universe is so amazingly complex and elegant, it has a magic of its very own.

** I think it has absolutely nothing to do with science. Why does more advanced technology fail around highly magical areas? Magic doesn't give a shit about the rules, and the highly literal nature of muggle science/technology can't handle it, and so stops working. I don't think it blows up, burns up, whatever. Just fucking stops.

*** I am asking for theories of how magic could work in real life, not your idiotic ramblings of how electronics short circuit around magic. Science is not all about electronics- it is quite literally impossible for the theories I stated to "Blow up" as that would cause the literal destruction of the entire universe.

** Magic works by way of magic. But if you want to be nitpicky, HP magic is based on concepts and symbols.

The Shield Charm isn't a manifestation of a particularly shaped arrangement of carbon nanotubes that stops things from getting through, it manifests the concept of protection. The Levitation Charm has nothing to do with atomic numbers, it simply makes things fly. Why? Because. Because it's magic. It's unexplainable. We can derive Rules of Magic, but that's it. Magic isn't implied to be some cosmic force, the SW Force, or some yet undiscovered scientific phenomenon that wizards can manipulate. The dictionary definition of magic would be "it's magic".

** Quite presumtuous of you to call other people idiots.

Still - why does it NEED a scientific explanation?

It's "magic" for crying out loud - could be that magicals control whatever made the Big Bang happen!

Note: However - if you use a scientific explanation for a fan-fiction than that's fine! Other people use stuff like "magical-cores" (not canon if I remember this right!) and building elaborate defenses the mimick real life structures for occlumency etc., so if it works for your fanfiction and adds to the story? Why not!

**** I'd disagree with that on the basis that fans of the original work who aren't into fanfiction probably haven't thought much about how it's all supposed to work. Fanfic readers, especially those who are also writers, enjoy 'gaming the rules' a bit more, so are more likely to have a theory or ten.

**** To be fair, though, looking at OP's comments here I think at least some of the people who downvoted the whole post did it after looking at those and deciding that this post is a pointless piece of excrement and thus should be downvoted due to not having value.

I mean, opinions go in many ways, but when someone asks for theories and then, when someone gives them a theory, immediately go for “You clearly don't understand” and “[I] wanted to see if people [...] were smart enough”, it's bound to make people think of it and thus treat it as a trolling attempt.

Because seriously, that's arrogant as ... fjord, and people aren't going to be lenient in their judgment when judging someone who'd shown themselves to be full of themselves for seemingly no reason.
