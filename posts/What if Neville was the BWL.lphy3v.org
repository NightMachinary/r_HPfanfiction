I may have asked this question before, but are there any decent fics out there where Neville is the BWL. There are a lot where Harry is not the BWL, but the story usually still revolves around him. I mean one with Nevill as the main character and the focus of the story, not Harry. What kind of dynamic would he have when facing situations in place of Harry? Would he be friends with Ron and Hermione, or would he have a completely different Golden Trio? I"m honestly fascinated by this concept.


** Whenver you decide on a premise that changes the basic framework of canon, you must try to come up with reasonable explanations for the change you're basing your story on.

If you want Neville as the BWL, you must come up with a sound alternative theory for Neville to be granted the protection that Lily's sacrifice granted upon her death to Harry.

Next, you form an idea about the background in which Neville will be raised: Will he be taken in by his grandmother (as in canon), or would he be raised by Frank or Alice (with their spouse dead) or by both his parents? Regardless of which choice of guardians you pick, Neville's character can and will vary wildly.

As for myself: I prefer stories where Neville is raised by his parents, where he features quite prominently in public life (as both Alice and Frank continue their work as Aurors), is reasonably talented (think Bill Weasley ie. an Os and EEs student) but struggles to form deep connections with his peers due to his reputation as the BWL. So he'd be friendly with all his housemates, and most of the school, but lack the kind of friendship canon Harry shared with Ron and Hermione.

Of course, I also prefer Harry to be in Slytherin in such stories, and possess talent comparable to his parents (at least), his canon character strengths while simulatenously having faults in his personality (selfishness, callousness, arrogance, anger, etc).
