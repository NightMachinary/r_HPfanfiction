I was just watching GOT when it came to me. Are there any crossovers where a GOT character ends up in the HP universe?

What's the point?

#+begin_quote
  Sansa didn't know where she was, but she stared up at the huge ruined castle before her in awe. It was larger than Winterfell by far, and must have been beautiful in its prime. She could see frames where large windows would once have stood, like those in the throne room at the Red Keep, and what remained of its crumbling towers reached for the clouds.

  Her focus shifted when she saw that a man was approaching from the direction of the castle. He was not pleasing to the eye, with lank, greasy hair, sallow skin and yellowed teeth, but after King's Landing Sansa was no stranger to such men.

  The man, who was wearing some kind of black robe, stopped in front of her. "Good day, Ser," she said, hoping her nervousness did not show in her voice. "I'm afraid I'm rather lost. What castle is this?"

  The man looked her up and down and his lip curled.

  "A Muggle," he said. Sansa had no idea what that meant. "How... fascinating."

  And then he raised a wooden stick and pointed it at her.

  "What's that?" she asked. "Why are you pointing it at me?"

  The man only said one word in reply.

  "Obliviate!"

Surely the only way it can end.

** I've read most of the fics that have already been posted, but by far the best crossover I've come across is called The Black Prince by cxjenious. (Sorry for not linking, I'm on mobile.) This guy really knows his got lore. It feels like Martin could have written it.

** It would be just her luck for Sansa to be reborn as Sansa Potter The-Girl-Who-Lived, only to attend Hogwarts and be creeped on by another weirdo for looking like her mother.

** Hmm I've spent an absurd amount of time reading HP/GoT crossovers recently, and to my knowledge, there aren't any good ones like this, but I do remember the summary of one where Sansa goes to the HP universe.

Let me find it and skim the first chapter. If it's any good, I'll link it.

Edit: Doesn't look too promising (as expected TBH). The writing is meh, and the chapters are short, plus, I don't know what the hell this has to do with GoT besides having a character named Sansa. Whatever, I'll post it anyway, but I wouldn't get my hopes up if I were you.

Edit2: Ahh judging by the A/N at the bottom my guess is that Sansa has memories from another life, aka reincarnation. As these things usually go in HP/GoT crossovers.

  Sansa Creevey is about to start her first year at Hogwarts, admitting to herself that she'll like Hogwarts, but she is plagued by her secrets in which no one knows about -- not even her own father, Dennis Creevey (Colin's younger brother). Her secrets will come out sooner than she thinks and she'll make new friends.

*** Fair warning though: This is more a long one-shot than anything else. It's good, don't get me wrong but don't expect a fic that goes over everything that happened in canon or too many details.

It's more about Rhaegar getting reborn in a new world and the relationship between Rhaegar and fem!Harry than anything else.

There's also a sequel that unfortunately has only 1 chapter so far in which Harry, Rhaegar and Sirius travel to Westeros.
