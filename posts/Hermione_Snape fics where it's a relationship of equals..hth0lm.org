I rather dislike fics where hermione is the weepy one and snape is the stoic angsty man who never sheds a tear. I mean fics where they're both healing or being vulnerable in front of each other works perfectly good.

So, I'm fine with any genre or plot or era, be it time-travel or the Marauders era or an After-the-war fic. Eroticas with Hermione as a Dom and Snape her sub are more than fine too.

I'd love it if you guys could help me out, so thanks a ton!
