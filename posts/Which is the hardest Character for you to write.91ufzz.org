in general, for me, it is Dumbledore. A good and helpful Dumbledore is really hard to write because there is so little actual conversation between Harry and Dumbledore in canon. Sure, Dumbledore pops in and throws in a few wise words every now and then, but actual discussions? Havent happend, or am I missing something?,

Anyways.\\

*** I write canon-compliant stories, and I was just about to say that she is the hardest one for me right now. I feel like I'm probably doing a pretty good job with her, but something just feels off on my end of the story. It's a struggle because I can't pinpoint the places where she doesn't quite fit (you know, so I can fix it)...but maybe that's just because Luna doesn't naturally fit with all the other characters. *shrug* My go-to right now is to have her dialogue be pretty normal, but insert werid actions every now and then like staring into space or skipping.

**** I think with Luna, the trick is to remember the /when/ of her behavior as much as the /what./

Luna, despite her popularity in the fandom, is a relatively minor character, even accounting for her late entry into the series.

So when do we see Luna?

It's curious. In public, she's actually far more...Luna-y. She laughs herself into a fit in a train compartment. She declares in front of over a dozen students that she supports Harry. She accuses Fudge of horrible crimes against goblins during DA meetings. She goes on about Loser's Lurgy during the Quidditch match of Gryffindor vs Hufflepuff.

But in smaller, more private interactions, her compassion shines through--she comforts Hermione in an otherwise empty bathroom and then hallway. She's very gentle towards Harry when they talk after Sirius's death.

So, I guess the trick is, save Luna's more important scenes for when she can have a private conversation. Use her as the adorable conspiracy theorist as a comic relief in crowd scenes.

Ginny, I can understand, even if it's almost never in any fanfic, since she's seen interacting with Fred and George throughout the canon--and as the baby of the family, she'd have means, motive, opportunity, and scapegoats if she ever wanted to pull pranks.

Another important thing to remember is Luna is explicitly described by Rowling as "not giving a damn about what others think of her." That's quite a bit different than Harry or Hermione or Neville, all of whom are bullied and all of whom react to it negatively.

He's also hung up on his secondary school crush from twenty years ago who got with his nemesis from twenty years ago, and demonstrates no signs of being physically attracted to anyone else in the series, and vice versa. He could be celibate of his own volition... but I don't think he has a choice as he is presented in the books.

I want him to actually be someone who lives up to the hype that Books 1 and 2 set him up for; someone who people fear so much that they do not speak his name.

In doing all of this I realized I was enjoying exploring so much Voldemort that the whole premise of what I was writing shifted, and naturally my original work never ended up getting anywhere as I delved into yet another rabbit hole.

*** Hm, interesting insight. As for me, I never had trouble pegging down Voldemort, but I don't try to take him seriously, because he cannot be taken seriously, in so many ways. That doesn't mean he's not threatening, of course, world-endingly so.

But Voldemort can be distilled to, quite simply, a misanthropist megalomaniac --- only with enough power to feed both of these vices without anyone telling him to quit it and stop being annoying.

He's a man who simultaneously finds the whole human race beneath him (magicals moreso than muggles, and humans moreso than nonhumans among the magicals, because they are /more similar to him/), and doesn't quite want to slaughter the sorry lot of them because he has a pathetic need for attention --- to be feared, respected, obeyed, admired.

He is clever enough and competent enough as a sorcerer to make good on what, in a regular Muggle man, would be drunken ramblings, but not self-conscious enough to realize how irrational his motivations are.

That... about sums it up.

**** I guess part of this comes from the fact the Books 1 and 2 made Voldemort just seem so larger than life.

People can't speak his name out of fear even though he has been "dead" for 11 years, he is talked about in hushed tones and only through a fluke is he defeated. In Book 2 we see the brilliance of Voldemort as a child, and more importantly we see that he was charismatic; fear was not his only tool. Tom Riddle was likable, loved and respected by both the students and staff alike.

Then Books 4 through 7 come along and Voldemort just kind of falls flat. I want more of what we saw earlier. I want a villain that is terrifying, not because they are utterly ruthless, but also because they are cunning and charismatic. They can just as easily defeat you with a wand as with words. I want a Voldemort like we see in POTDK or HPMOR. They are fascinating and complex, and yet still remain "Voldemort" and not an OC villain.

Maybe my Voldemort isn't canon Voldemort and I'm okay with that, because honestly canon Voldemort was pretty poorly done. I found Galbatorix to be a better villain, and Paolini is nowhere near the level of JK.

** I have never found Dumbledore to be an issue; indeed, he is a prominent secondary character in my story. My best succinct advice (though only if you're familiar enough with /Doctor Who/ for it to be useful) is that he is an older-, wiser-sounding version of the Doctor. A very silly and friendly person, extremely clever and wise but doesn't always let on, forced through many heartbreaking hardships over a very, very long life, which he keeps in the back of his mind but does his best never to talk about. Perhaps not entirely as virtuous as he sometimes thinks he is, but he makes a honest effort to live up to that image he has of himself, and the world can be thankful for that.

As to what characters are hardest... basically, the ordinary ones, those with the fewest larger-than-life "quirks", who are nonetheless allies, and are too involved to just write them off all the time. Yer Lupins, yer McGonagalls, even Harry himself if he isn't the main protagonist. The baseline is they're generally going to behave rightly and decently and kindly, and... what next? What can they do in the story to further the plot? What makes them interesting as characters? They have no /bounce/. Give me someone weird and interesting like Snape or Moody or Hagrid any day.

Even more "colorful" characters like Tonks or Ginny can slip into that rabbit hole, because they don't have a coherent motive. They're just... nice people, the sort you could meet in real life and be friends with. They don't have a motivation to be interwined with the other characters, they have no special past or destiny. They have no particular drive to achieve something that would be interesting to read about --- or as good as none; "I wanna be an Auror" has limited narrative possibilities, /except/ if you make it about the journey itself rather than /her/ actions through it, and in that case what you're actually writing about is the Auror drill instructor or the weird Ministry policies or the Dark Wizards she has to chase, /not/ Tonks herself; and as for "I wanna marry Harry Potter"... well... write it for too long and it turns either into a sappy romance, or it makes her sound like a stalker.

It wasn't that he was a closeted Mudblood sympathizer - he ONLY cared about Lily. He was actually, genuinely cruel to his students. Where was that protector role when he insulted Hermione after his students cursed her? Or all those times he tore into Neville? (I've seen people argue that he was only so vicious toward Neville because he was afraid Neville would seriously hurt someone - so why doesn't he just have Neville be unable to brew potions until he does enough written work that Snape considers him competent enough to work on live potions again?)

Snape cared about Harry because Harry was Lily's kid. He really did want to take down Voldemort because Voldemort killed Lily. I fail to see how he measures up as a 'good guy' otherwise.

It's been said before: James had a friend who discrimination and bullying, so he studied for years and completed a dangerous ritual to keep him company. Snape had a friend who was suffering from discrimination and bullying, so he /joined the bullies./

Snape's class is inherently dangerous, but he does TEACH the kids versus having them read aloud like Lockhart or Umbridge. I'd have absolutely loved to have taken his potions class.

Or Death Eaters would have been dealt with like any other illegal combatant (summary execution), something perfectly legal according to the Third Geneva Convention (Article 4)?

********* Dumbledore doesn't care about student safety in the big picture, or he wouldn't have set Harry Potter up to die. Or go through the 3 headed dog in book 1, or let him do Goblet of Fire. Or let Malfoy stay on as a student after he almost killed that girl with that cursed necklace. That's off the top of my head, I'm sure there is more.

Snape does not teach chemistry. Wizards aren't exactly as fragile as muggles either, if you haven't noticed.

You are correct on that last point, in an AU world, they could have used lasers and lightsabers against Death Eaters. Dumbledore could have hired Lockhart to teach potions maybe? There is definitely no Geneva convention for the minister of magic, and the wizarding world is a ghastly place where there is one prison where everyone is tortured a lot. And where the wealthy were able to bribe or trick their way out of it so they could be around for the second rise of Voldemort. It's a nasty world, it's not just "Snape is a meanie".

It applies to citizens of the UK however. And I doubt that the statute of secrecy included a separate citizenship since Harry never gets any sort of magical ID or Passport which would indicate that, nor is anything even remotely similar mentioned.

He did delay it for as long as possible in the hope to force out a situation that /might/ allow Harry to survive it. Also, Harry was no longer a student by the time this came to be.

*** the thing with snape is that a lot of people end up writing their responses to him (because he, likely more than every other character, inspires strong feelings in people, on both ends of the spectrum), than the actual character, which is what you seem to do. you have no actual proof he wouldn't have left the DEs had neville been targeted, just that he wouldn't have left for neville. regardless, lily was targeted and that /did/ catalyse change in him

** Hermione, especially as a love interest.

#+begin_quote
  Wait a second Hellstrike, Hermione is easy to write. She follows all rules and nags Harry into submission. She likes books, learning and the library.
#+end_quote

Except, that is not Hermione. True, she had an obsession with rules, yet at the same time had no issue torching Snape two months into her first year. In fact, she crosses rules whenever they are in her way, but to get that moment right, to find that threshold, is a slippery slope.

Yes, Hermione had an obsession with learning, but let's face it, it's magic. Any Muggleborn would try to learn those awesome feats of magic. It might not always be exemplary participation in class, but most kids would try to learn at least the awesome or useful bits of magic. And given the annual threat of murder or worse, learning to defend yourself should be her (and Harry's) top priority, especially since there is no real alternative in their position.

Hermione is probably neither the nicest nor the most diplomatic person around. She nags people when she thinks that they are doing something wrong (like not studying before exams), yet at the same time she is mostly justified in her concerns. She can be headstrong, stubborn to a fault and rarely admits that she was wrong (but so does everybody else in the series). Yet at the same time she deeply cares about the few people close to her and I'd argue that the times where she acts in an annoying fashion are often the ones where she has little experience like with academic failure or openly expressing her emotions for others. She is loyal to Harry to a fault and often the one who points him in the right direction before he goes off and does Harry things (summoning charm practice, the DA).

Another aspect is her appearance. Hermione is no supermodel, but besides her teeth (which get fixed in GoF) she has no outstanding ugly features either. She can become pretty given time and enough +plaster+ make-up, but so can nearly every woman, especially with magic. At the same time, falling for someone can turn someone's most mundane features into the most attractive thing on earth, yet writing that can also turn odd really quickly, even if from Harry's PoV, her barely visible dusting of freckles is the best thing ever.

Lastly her attitude towards sex. It is very difficult to write something consistent and NOT TROPE-y. Given her academic inclinations, she should, at the very least, be knowledgeable about the theoretical side of things and done her fair share of self-exploration (for science). Yet at the same time, it is not a topic she ever even mentions besides reassuring Harry that he is a decent kisser.

Honestly, I think that it is a subject that she would only talk about with people she is very comfortable with. But writing that without turning it into "it's always the quiet ones" isn't that easy, especially if you want to give her some offscreen experiences of the "summer romance" kind with some boy she met while on a holiday in France and has not seen ever since.

Tl;dr: Due to her complexity and her faults, which are not really emphasised in canon even if they are there, Hermione is difficult to get right if you want something better than the fanon caricatures of her self.

**** She is bloody difficult to get right. Harry is pretty easy, he goes along with the flow of things unless something is seriously fucked up or somebody needs saving. Most of the background cast id made up of complete blanks or characters with a few defined traits that leave enough space for whatever you want to make them (Tonks, Fleur, most of the DA).

But Hermione is well defined and often restricts you if you want to keep her in character.

** Harry is actually the hardest character for me to write. My main character is a Slytherin he became close with in first and second year, who is good friends with Hermione and the Weasley's as well. But Harry's constant idea that he's doing the right thing (which is basically true in canon) is applied to situations where he is in the wrong, so I have issues trying not to make him an antagonist and just a good guy who has a habit of thinking he's right. I'm not sure I that makes sense to anyone but me lol.

Where does that habit come from if he is not right about things? His time at the Durselys certainly did not imbue that attitude and if he doesn't get things right he should not have those expectations.

**** Can you tell me any time at Hogwarts where Harry thinks he's wrong? He thinks he's right that Snape wants to steal the stone first year. Second year, he thinks he's right to trust the diary and he's convinced that Malfoy is the heir of Slytherin. Third year, he thinks he's right about Sirius being out to get him. Fourth year, he thinks he should trust Mad-Eye. Fifth year, he's actually right on his superstitions about Umbridge and needing to start the DA. Sixth year, he cheats in potions all the time because he won't return the actually dangerous book.

***** Why exactly was the potion book dangerous? The spell was for enemies, Malfoy tried to use an unforgivable... Hell, he was an illegal combatant, something usually punished with summary execution.

And none of the instances where he was wrong were of any consequence. Snape wasn't trying to get the stone, but Quirrel was. Sirius wasn't out to kill Harry, but the dementors were the real threat and he got that right. Perhaps the only time when he really fucks up is with Sirius and the vision.

****** I don't know what you're trying to argue here. My point is that he always is that way with my character: he thinks he's right when he's not. It's a trait that he exemplifies to some extent in every book but since it is not his major trait, it's hard to make that a major trait, specifically in his interactions with my made up character, while making him not bee that way to the point where he isn't the canon version of Harry.

And with the danger of the potions book, he nearly kills Malfoy. Did he even have a reason to go into that bathroom? What did he think he would do? Tell Malfoy that he should stop and that everything would be over, no. Harry probably went in there to fight when Malfoy was trying to cry in peace. Harry also is fairly certain the spell is dark magic but he uses it anyway because he TRUSTS the book, which is why he's wrong in this scenario.

******* First, Malfoy, at that point, had attempted multiple counts of attempted murder, caused severe bodily harm to two people, was an illegal combatant and a war criminal and attempting to lead a raid of war criminals into a school.

But what I mean is that in canon Harry is rarely completely wrong. Snape didn't try to steal the stone, but Quirrel did. That's still a teacher working for Voldemort trying to steal it. And if your character clashes with Harry over his "rightness" on anything but the DoM, he's a nitpicking dick. So Harry suspected the wrong teacher... There was still a teacher working for Voldemort, living in the bloody school for a year without ANYONE noticing and without further consequences. Voldemort is confirmed as alive for fucks sake, and you want to give Harry shit for suspecting the abusive teacher who had actually been a Death Eater? You want to give Harry shit over not figuring out the Pettigrew/Sirius thing while nobody else did? For being fooled by fake Moody while everyone else was fooled as well (and fake Moody did more for Harry than any other teacher)?

That's why I was confused about your character motivations. Harry's wrongness was never (DoM as exception here) substantial enough to give him shit over it, so I assumed that he was actually completely wrong about a couple things so that the criticism would be valid. But if Harry had been seriously wrong a couple times, he wouldn't insist on being right because he has nothing to base that belief on, unlike in canon.
