I wanted to know: does anyone else have dreams that could fit into the HP universe? For example last night, there were no characters or locations from the books or movies but the activity could have worked. With the quarantine, I'm one of the lucky people getting to keep my job and working from home. I don't have an office so I've commandeered the couch. Because of this I have seen more cooking shows than I've ever wanted. Of the shows my grandma watches I like 'Guy's Grocery Games', 'Beat Bobby Flay', and the various 'Chopped' shows best.

THEY'RE INVADING MY DREAMS!!! Last night I dreamed there were stations set up in the woods and people competing, but with brewing potions rather than cooking or baking food. All of my fanfic ideas originated as a dream or at least a piece of it. Here's another little plot bunny that may stand alone, but I think I can incorporate it into one of the fics I'm already writing.

Secondary question: where do you get your ideas from?
