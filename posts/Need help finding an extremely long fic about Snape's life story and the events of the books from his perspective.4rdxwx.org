I screwed up and deleted my browser history and for some reason didn't bookmark it. It's a huge fic, hundreds of thousands of words long. It starts from Snape's birth, goes into his childhood, school years, how he becomes a teacher, and then basically goes through the events of the book from his perspective.

I thought I could find it with google, but there are so many HP fics it seems to be impossible. Hope someone knows what I'm talking about!


** Sounds like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7937889/1/A-Difference-in-the-Family-The-Snape-Chronicles][A Difference in the Family]].

*** Yes! This is it! Thank you so much, I couldn't for the life of me remember what it was called. I'll be sure to bookmark it this time.
