slight Dumbledore/Ron/Hermione/Weasleys bashing, accepted

Slytherin Harry, liked

Tom Riddle not Voldemort involvement, liked

Harry joins Voldemort, neutral

Riddle/Horcrux as teacher/mentor, liked


** I had a story where my main character engineered it "coming true" in a ludicrously munckin-esque way to get rid of it: she had Sirius Black create an alias of "the Other", solemnly named an ant "Either" and a hamster "Neither", and then had Sirius swat the ant and keep the hamster as a pet. Hence, "Either must die at the hand of the Other, and Neither can live while the Other survives".

** There's a Worm/Harry Potter crossover called /A Wand for Skitter/ where Taylor (the super villain reincarnated into the Harry Potter universe after averting the apocalypse in her world) makes herself into Harry's right hand (wo)man and then defeats Voldemort by having Winky blow up a time turner on him, trapping him in a bubble of eternally looping time. Funnily enough, this doesn't actually kill Voldemort, but he's certainly not "living" in that gray boy loop.
