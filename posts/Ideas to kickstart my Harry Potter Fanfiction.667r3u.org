Hello, I need a few ideas to kickstart my Harry Potter Fanfiction idea. It is a Harry/Ginny Time Travel Soul Bond I want them to just have been married and then sent back in time to right after Harry finds out he is a wizard due to some sort of accident, and something happens to reveal their bond to her family but not the time travel, and of course Dumbledore won't be as manipulative as most stories make him out to be, and they go through all of the years, but I have a few different surprises for them to keep them from becoming Super Harry and Super Ginny with their knowledge. I am open to a whole bunch of suggestions and ideas, I have a general idea of how I want things to go but nothing really written down yet. I am just missing some of the finer details to kickstart it.

*** Diary Horcrux was canon Voldemort for all we knew, I doubt he was a separate entity.

***** Could be because of the time the Horcrux was created/Voldemort's current soul shard not being able to merge with him until he was created.

*** I've read that before. Yes, like that, but I don't want to completely copy it. I think I can add a bunch of ideas to a soul bond time travel fic. Like for instance, in that fic, they don't tell Dumbledore and he is kinda manipulative, in my fic they do tell him, and he provides ideas to make things somewhat easier although things don't always happen the same way, and Harry and Ginny do outright change some things.

** May I ask a few questions first? Why you want them to be soul-bound? How do you define this Bond/ How does this Bond work? Why does it have to be Time-Travel?

Also, if you have a general idea, maybe you should share it to make any suggestion more precise. Like this we can only kinda throw suggestions in there without a target. If you have a general understanding of your plotline, it would make for a far better start.

Fill us in, then. We really can't help you much if you don't give us information first.

** Well the Bond is there because the fact they were married before they went through time and it is trying to keep them together. I had planned on changing the dates of different events in the story from what they were originally, and also outright having some events like who comes out of the Triwizard cup different, I wanted the characters to not only use their past knowledge but their own inherent skills to solve problems. At the beginning most events will be the same, except Harry will get away from the Dursleys and Sirius will be freed some point before they start Hogwarts. Oh and I actually like the idea of Harry and Ginny going to Hogwarts together, but am not quite sure how I am going to manage that.
