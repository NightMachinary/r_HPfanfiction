***** I enjoyed most of it, that puts it in the top 1% for me. Enough for me to call it "great", although I did have some stuff I'd like to see improved.

***** I completely agree. Harry's ability is pretty cool, but theres a lot wrong with the story. At one point the author commented: "I don't even knoe what I'm doing anymore" or something like that. Not to mention the author pairs a 12 year old Harry with an adult tonks.

** Linkffn(The Merging) has covered the course of a Harry/Tonks relationship and moved out the other side but is still worth reading.

#+begin_quote
  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?
