Why, when saying the amount in Harry's vaults, does everyone always say something like “4070 galleons, 892 sickles and 72 knuts.”? Like, honestly, would you say “70 pounds and 350 pence”? No! So why do we do it with wizarding money?!


** Because it's not like it's digital and makes galleons out of knuts and sickles. It's physical. Usually in describing a vault so yeah you could say there's a hundred galleons in knuts but it's easier to say how many knuts there are instead.

*** It's still a bit weird though even with physical cash you still just say the sum total in the form of the greatest unit.

Even in coinage you'd say you had "three pound fifty" even if it was all in ten or fifty pence pieces.

**** It's probably the conversion rates of the money itself and that there's 2 different formulas to convert from the lowest to the highest. 17 Sickles to a Galleon, with 29 Knuts to a Sickle... unlike most currency which usually has only whatever it uses and sometimes an amount lower than 1.

It'd still be weird to have 72 Knuts and 892 Sickles as you can break those down into Sickles/Galleons to save on space and resources.

I think it's just one of those tropes that's become believed to be canon because it's so prevalent in the fandom (I think marriage contracts is another of those).

****** Personally, I think the weird coin thing is because Rowling saw a D&D loot table once and it got stuck in her head that it's how fantasy money should look when you write about it.

As to marriage contract fanon...you've got death vows and cursed contracts in canon.

That doesn't make marriage contracts exactly prevalent or culturally accepted, but you'd be naive to assume it's not used by some families at some point to enforce their will.

Probably not hideously complex ones kept on file with the goblins that Sirius can use to plot cookie the Cup out of Gringotts the moment he's free, but to enforce the end of a feud or to force someone you've got power over to follow through on the terms you're imposing on you?

There's no way Hermione's the only one ever to try that.

I think it's supposed to be a parody of old English coins. Like the one described [[http://projectbritain.com/moneyold.htm]].

Honestly, JKR needs a lot more appreciation for all the satire she used in HP.

******* It's much more old English coinage than anything, your typical DnD style system is nice round numbers with each coin worth 10 or 100 of the one below.

******* True, but the MC concept seem way too common and a lot of it seems to be presumed. I agree it's one of those changes that makes sense but it's funny to me how it became a fan idea, to fanon, and now a trope.

** Wizarding currency isn't a fiat currency, it is composed of precious metals.

In such a system, it's normal to refer to what you actually have rather than its nominal face value. If I'm holding 17 pieces of silver and someone asks me how much gold I have, the answer isn't "one coin" it's "none, but I have some silver".

Its also a matter of convenience in a system where any give combination of coins may translate to multiple different other combinations. Pre decimalisation, for example, it was common for people to talk in shillings and pence without converting to higher denominations like guineas and pounds because those higher value coins were relatively rare.

Further, a coin's actual value may deviate from its face value. For example, traditionally China valued silver much more highly than European nations did, and gold comparatively less. If a wizard goes on holiday to China, he might like to exchange his galleons for sickles before he goes.

**** I feel like you've just ignored my post...

1. Wizarding currency is made of precious metals. Therefore it must have two values: its face value as dictated by the government/minting authority, and the value of the metal of which it is made. Those values can diverge, especially when you travel to jurisdictions outside the minting authority.

2. You are comparing decimalised currency for non-decimalised currency, which operate in fundamentally different ways. People don't speak in the same terms when using these currencies.

This is the old English currency system, which the wizarding system is intended to parody:

- 2 farthings = 1 halfpenny

- 2 halfpence = 1 penny (1d)

- 3 pence = 1 thruppence (3d)

- 6 pence = 1 sixpence (a 'tanner') (6d)

- 12 pence = 1 shilling (a bob) (1s)

- 2 shillings = 1 florin ( a 'two bob bit') (2s)

- 2 shillings and 6 pence = 1 half crown (2s 6d)

- 5 shillings = 1 Crown (5s)

- 4 Crowns = 1 pound (20s, or 240d)

- 5 pounds = 1 guinea

Let's say you have 2 shillings and 7 pence in your hand. This can be described all sorts of ways:

- 31 pence

- 2 shillings 7 pence

- 1 florin 7 pence

- 1 half crown 1 pence

- £0.12

In reality, people would just say /what they actually have/ physically - that is, 2 shillings and 7 pence. And of all the possibilities, the one they would almost certainly never do is convert what they have into the highest possible denomination. The figure in pounds is actually £0.1291666... (recurring).
