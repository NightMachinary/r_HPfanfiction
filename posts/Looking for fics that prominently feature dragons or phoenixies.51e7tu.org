I really like these two creatures in particular. What stories do you know of that feature one or both of them in an important role?

I'd also like any recommendations that explore the Animagus transformation in detail, or involve other dangerous creatures like basilisks and nundus on the same side as the protagonist. These don't have to involve dragons of phoenixes.

  Response to GoldenSteel's My gf is a what? challenge. GoF: Hermione has a secret. One that even she doesn't know. When she unearths a highly dangerous ritual to help Harry in the first task, the two of them never expected that secret to hit them both and change them into Great Dragons! Are they doomed to be treated as beasts? What does this mean for the TWT? H/Hr; AD/RW/MW putdown.
