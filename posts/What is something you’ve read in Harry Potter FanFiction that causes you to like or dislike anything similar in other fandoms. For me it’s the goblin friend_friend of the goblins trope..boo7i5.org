I mean there are concerning times, like his so called diner the 1st time Dobby visits him, the time after the dementors attack, or pretty much anytime he is trully punished by the Dursley. But these events are pretty rare (Harry was not beaten black and blue every week, and even his accidents with magic seemed rare when he was a child).

From what I remember, the Dursley do nourish him, though Dudley always rush on his favourite food when there is, and the only time he is truly in a pinch seems to be at the start of 4th year with Dudley's diet, when he cheats and has food hidden.

Once again, Harry did have a bad childhood, and what the Dursley did totally count as abuse, but there are level of abuse and it's not like Harry reached Hogwarts as a broken boy barely able to stand after years of malnourishments.

The nimbus 2000 tops out at 100 mph supposedly which is ~44 m/s. Radial acceleration is velocity^{2} divided by the radius. Now let's assume harry had a decent arc going and pulls out after 20 meters (a lot more than canon) we end up with 44^{2} /20 = 1936/20 = 96.8 and since the the number of Gs is calculated by a/g, 96.8/9.81 = 9.87 Gs and seeing as the average person passes out at 5 Gs harry would be a pancake.

Not to mention how grossly limited canon magic is to what we've seen in many fics.

What exactly would the average wizard's counter to an armored goblin troop with magic resistant shields charging them be? Because I have a hard time believing goblins still rely on armor and shields if they weren't effective at blocking magic.

I don't see how that would be that big a disadvantage. Most people, even in canon, aren't combat masters. Maybe they know one or two, or even several offensive spells, but what good would that do against an iron shield and armor? It would splash off without effect.

And even going by cannon, I'm pretty sure that battle transfiguration and area of effect elemental spells are pretty rare, which is what you'd really need to counter an armored force like that.

Even the unforgivables like avada kedavra are blocked by a piece of stone, and that's supposed to be really hard to cast.

Alright, but then you're getting into AU shit. As far as we know, year 7 and NEWT education /is/ the highest level.

And given the small population of English wizards as a whole, proportionately speaking - if you look at what % of the population in Western society goes on to higher education - I have a really hard time believing that there would be that many highly educated wizards there at all. Much less wizards that would focus on combat-applicable magic.

******* I was under the impression that the goblin population was smaller than the wizard one. Even if it's not, it wouldn't be dramatically greater than the 10,000-ish wizards in Britain.

Also, one of the tropes that annoys /me/ most about goblins is when people forget that Gringotts is a /bank/, not a legal firm, law enforcement agency, hospital, or whatever else would be useful to Harry at the time. And the goblins are a functional society of their own besides--one where craftsmanship is most valued, not battle prowess. I don't think the goblins would have dramatically more trained warriors than the wizards.

And finally, remember that all wizards take at least 5 years of self-defense, which is more than most muggles. Leaving aside the terrible teaching, the wizarding world is a very heavily armed society by tilted toward the wizards.

***** I once wrote a piece on how we only see really far above wizards and witches in Harry Potter. In other words, some of the teachers (McGonagall, Flitwick and Snape, who seemed to be the only ones who could actually get rid of the Twins' swamp or do impressive feats of magic), Voldemort and Dumbledore obviously, Bill, Twins and Arthur (Bill as a cursebreaker, Twins and Arthur as amazing inventors, maybe charlie as a dragontamer), and some select few outside of those mentioned.

Because if you look around in the scenes where they encounter other people: In the Ministry, where there are tons of people who sit around and just duplicate flyers one by one... Yaxley had to go to maintenance to do something where Hermione was like: try these two spells first

We see the twins marketing their protective gear, because a significant portion of people cannot cast a shield spell properly

People turning to Lockhart (Molly) to learn stuff (And we all know what kind of fraud he turned out to be... but it took 3 12 year olds to figure that out?)

We have the Knight bus for people who are inept or inable to apparate.

The wizengamot that is surprised and impressed that Harry can perform a corporeal Patronum. Something that many adults cannot do but that a 13 year old boy apparently can learn to do.

And then we have the whole business side of Harry Potter. Notice how most jobs simply do not require magic? The MoM is mostly bureaucratic. The artisan class / the shops in the alley? We have books, ice cream, seamstresses, wandmakers, apotheocaries and other goods. You just dont need that much magic to be successful.

Sure, there are some specialized things like books, or wands, or enchanted items which you need to trade or buy - but almost everything that we work for today; food, shelter, entertainment, etc can be achieved solely with magic.

I have absolutely why the idea of the "low wage ministry clerk" even exists, it doesn't make any sense. Everyone can be completely self-sufficient at a minimum, and an entrepreneur or master at some craft on the other end of the scale.

  “That is immaterial! Wizards refuse to share the secrets of wand-lore with other magical beings, they deny us the possibility of extending our powers!”

***** I mean it depends on the situation someone like dumbledore, Voldemort, Grindelwald, or OP!God!harry could probably stand in the middle of a goblin army and rip them all to shreds without getting touched.

But the average wizard is probably pretty shit at offensive magic. They did their DADA OWL or NEWT and never touched it again.

*** Very little is known about goblin-wrought silver, besides that is "indestructible," imbibes only that which strengthens it, and is the Goblin Nation's most tightly guarded secret. You could interpret this in a lot of ways.

Picture a horde of goblins storming Diagon Alley, each one clad in full silver (or silver coated, at least) plate mail that renders them impervious to all direct spellfire except the killing curse, which is notoriously difficult to cast. Their weapons cut through enchantments like they're nothing, and any weaponized potions only make their armor stronger.

The only way to defeat them would be via brute physical force, which a wizard proficient in transfiguration and animation charms could manage. But direct spellfire would do nothing as the goblins storm the streets.

With armor like this, you could turn the uneasy peace between wizards and goblins into mutually assured destruction- both sides can harm the other, but the cost would be too high.

I've seen plenty of fics where Harry gets some special training over the summer, either by himself or by having someone like Sirius or Dumbledore train him, and by the end of it he can defeat groups of death eaters by himself.

I understand wanting your main character to be strong, but if training for 3 months made you that powerful every wizard would be as skilled as Dumbledore and Voldemort.

  The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that. Not until they'd stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe properly again. Hermione did a sort of jig.

  “Malfoy's got detention! I could sing!”

  “Don't,” Harry advised her.

  Chuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about in his crate. About ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping down out of the darkness. (PS, Chapter 14)
#+end_quote

Given that they're breaking curfew to smuggle out a dragon, and Harry's had no previous opportunity to know whether or not Hermione sings well, I think his response is just about not being caught.

I feel like people don't understand what that actually means.

Feasibility aside - let's just assume that a very thin material can be bullet proof to any meaningful degree - all it means is that there won't be penetration.

The kinetic energy of the bullet doesn't just disappear when it hits it. No, even when people are wearing Kevlar for the rated caliber, there's still some really nasty bruising. It can get really ugly.

I have a really hard time believing that even a magical Spidey suit can defend against a .50 cal round. That will break ribs even if it does somehow stop it. And a headshot? Forget it, that's a skull fracture, /at least/ (and that's assuming magical Spidey suit and magical Spidey durability).

...That's just blatantly untrue.

As shown in the link above, Spider-Man can:

- Lift a tank (60-70 tons), catch and throw trucks, throw people hundreds of feet into the air, chip Iron Man's armor, break through steel, punch people through walls, punch Wolverine through bullet-proof glass, and much more.

- Shrug off being thrown through several walls, survive a hit from someone who can kick through 10 feet of steel, take explosions equal to grenades, survive missiles at close range, get shot by multiple bullets and keep swinging, survive explosions that melt steel and then continue fighting literally the next day, and much more.

- Dodge bullets /after/ they're fired, leap hundreds of feet in the air, move so fast that people are unable to see anything but a vague blur, can run /at least/ 60+ mph, and much more.

He's far beyond "mostly human with some spider traits."

*** Uhm, my forearm is almost 15 or 16 inches and I'm still growing. I don't understand how an 11 inch wand would restrict movement for most adults or people in the later Hogwarts years since the UK has one of the largest average Height in the world.

**** tape a ruler against your forearm / wrist and now use your arm. Thats what I mean by that. You are restricted and it is noticeable. And thats just one part of it. Now imagine a wand. You most certainly only need one end of the wand in your hand, it isnt interchangeable. So youd need to have a spring trap or something that ejects the wand into your hand. all 11 inches. So everytime you do that movement you have your wand potentially sprung out of your wandholder. Do the imaginary wand ejection movement. Now scratch the backside of your head. You use the same muscles and its the same hand movement.

And that is also leaving aside that you'd have to perfectly catch your wand every single time. otherwise you fumble.

THe solution to that? Wand in a waistholder.

****** That'd actually be a preferred solution (And why I hate the flick wrist things as mentioned in my first post) but again it restricts movement as you would have to have this huge thing covering your forearm

******* I just taped my Elder wand imitation to my left arm and the restriction is actually quite manageable. The only annoying thing about it is that twisting your forearm is a little more difficult. A small price to pay so that your wand doesn't snap when you fall because it was in your pocket or even a waist-holster since the surface there wouldn't be flat, leaving a chance for the wand to break in a fall

******** I disagree but maybe different strokes for different people

I used a wand holder of a friend of mine who does cosplay and her wand + the contraption was just too cumbersome for me to carry 24/7 like most fanfics do when Harry finally gets his omg amazing present from Sirius! And dont forget the subsequent scene where Harry in a second takes out his wand and threatens someone with it now!!!

*** I'm very similar but with Ginny and Hermione. The real problem with Hermione is that people make her the devil or an angel, eater any middle ground. My dislike of Ginny is that it made canon seem much more like a storybook where the girl dreaming of the valiant knight gets the one she had been crushing on since she was a little girl.

**** I always hated Ginny. First of all, stalker much. Just like I dislike NaruHina for Naruto because dating the girl that constantly stalks you is fucked up.

Even if we ignore the creepiness of dating one's stalker. Dating Ginny is a violation of the bro-code so it automatically loses my support.

***** Very true. I honestly would have preferred it if Harry ended up with a Slytherin. Or had a Slytherin friend and didn't name their kid albus Severus. Basically something that didn't pretty much say that it's fine to hate a group based on a few people. Instead we got happily ever after and a romance that started out of pure jealousy and hero worship.

** For me, it was the "Find out that you are the sole heir/culmination of several powerful family lines or beings"

Going to Gringotts and having him get tested for his vaults, only to find out that he is somehow Heir of House Potter, Black, Peverell, Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hogwarts and Merlin.

And from there, it kinda spread into other fanfics. Naruto somehow receiving all parts of the Uzumaki bloodline, the Mokuton appearing, Namikaze having a secret bloodline AND somehow having the Rinnegan/Sharigan. Same thing with the Marvel Universe. Genius Stark gets Extremis and also somehow finds out that he is the son of Loki and some other mythical being so he has extra extra extra super powers and abilites now.

** Any character become edgy like evil Harry,

Most Harry/Hermione ship, we as in HPfanfiction(not subreddit) community suck at writting of those ship, like really bad.

Day 1, character that fanfiction ship talk to each other like good friend. Day 4, character that fanfiction ship suddenly address to each other with cringy name for example, "oH LoVe my HeRmIoNe oH lOvE~~~~"

almost any good character bashing, in other word every Ron and Dumbledore bashing, like wtf be original for once and bash Hermione or Harry for once, she, Hermione is literally a semi-Mary Sue, not fully Marry Sue, why is no one bashing her flaws for love of god, I would not pay to read that type of fanficition but I would certainly enjoy reading it.

abusing the word of, fOr tHe gReAtEr gOoD, like Dumbledore already went through that phase long ago, so why don't you 31 year old fanfiction writter end your rebel phase already and stop theorising Dumbledore is secretly manipulative evil wizard like you're not special. Stop. Please. Get some help.

any good character become evil, pretty much edgy, same as #1, like Snape is evil in certain fanfiction, they don't work in my eyes,

Bashing Dumbledore for leaving Harry in care of abusing(not physically) and neglecting foster care, like it's not even about greater good(god this community makes me hate that sentence) anymore, it's literally DO or DIE, admit the fact Harry will not may die but people around him, taking care of Harry certainly will just like Alice and Frank Longbottom.

​

As if another simple fidelius charm or hiding in a subway station in the wizarding world can stop hundreds of death eater, most of them are the upper higher class possessing dangerous amount of politic power and wealth, from literally strangling the Boy Who Live.

​

Pretty much 90% of Harry Potter fanfiction in a nutshell, although to be fair, it's called FanFiction for a good reason, I don't really like those concept, they can be cringy as Twilight fanfiction, especially if the writting is cringy as the edgy concept. Some could possibly work for the sake of fanfiction but it's sooo obvious the author have grude for those certain character their writing.
