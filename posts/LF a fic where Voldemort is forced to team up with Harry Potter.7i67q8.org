I want to find a fic where Harry and Voldemort, or the Death Eaters and the Order of Phoenix are forced to make a truce and work together. Maybe the truce stays, maybe they betray each other in the end.


** there was this one where Harry, Dumbledore, and Voldie teamed up against a demon or something at Azkaban. Harry was Lighting dragon slayer? It was rather weird but fun to read. Can't remember the name though.

** linkao3(The Anti-Heroine by cheshire_carroll) has that to an extent. It's really well-written, although the tags are a bit intimidating and there's a lot of dark scenes.

  Hermione Granger knows she's not a good person. Disillusioned with life at only twelve years old; she is cynical, manipulative, ruthless and, above all else, a survivor. For six years she has lived on the streets of London with only her sharp mind and her sharper knives to keep her alive, but a letter from an owl changes everything for Hermione, and the bond she forms on the Hogwarts Express with a timid boy with broken glasses, skinny wrists and a lightning-shaped scar will change the whole of Wizarding Britain.  Main Pairing: Harry Potter/Hermione Granger/Tom Riddle

Also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11975368/1/The-Stormreaver][The Stormreaver]] has everyone getting together to put down some Old God insurrection with a pretty predictable outcome. Harry/Warcraft cross where he gets raised/trained by Gul'dan to serve the Legion.

** Harry Potter and The King of Kings By: PeopleBoreMe\\
When a force far greater than the Dark Lord threatens to take over all of England, the dark and the light must band together or perish. But will The Order of the Phoenix and the Death Eaters be able to forgive and forget?
