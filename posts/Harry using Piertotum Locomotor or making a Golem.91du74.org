Sorry if it's been asked before, if it has would you mind linking it for me as I've been looking my self for a couple of days now.

Would like to see some of the other magic that isn't brought up a lot

like a dark harry fic with necromancy

or a decent rune fic where they aren't just drawn in a circle or tattooed on to someone.

Would prefer MC to be harry but it won't make or break the fic for me.

Thank you to any replies!!!♥️


** In the Lie I've Lived by jbern linkffn(3384712) he creates a golem and the Sorting Hat uses it as a body. Also in C'Est la Vie by cywscross linkao3(3390668) he doesn't create a golem but he uses runes a lot, finally Innocence is fleeting, Death stays true forever by SSC linkffn(2764451) is the best necromantic Harry I've ever read.

  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

  Spoilers for books 1 to 5. NonHBP compliant. In the summer after OotP, Harry starts thinking: is death really irreversible? Necromancer!Harry.

** Linkffn(The Arithmancer)

In this one they really delve into Arithmancy and runic work, and Hermione creates several spells for which the process is really cool. It also has a lot of details about potion work.

  Hermione grows up as a maths whiz instead of a bookworm and tests into Arithmancy in her first year. With the help of her friends and Professor Vector, she puts her superhuman spellcrafting skills to good use in the fight against Voldemort. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

*** Awesome love it when they go into detail about stuff, especially potions and alchemy since so much if it could be explained with chemistry.
