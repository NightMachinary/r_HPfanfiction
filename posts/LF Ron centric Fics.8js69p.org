Im looking for some Ron centric fics that deal with Ron thinking he is just a sidekick to Hermione and Harry. Like how Harry is the brave one and in the spotlight and Hermione is the one with the smarts and reasoning.


** in linkffn(Stay Standing) he feels inferior and doesnt want to be a burden

*** I really loved that fic until the point where Ron was brought back to England. After that it seems like the author lost their outline and didn't know how to wrap it all up.

**** I think it's when it went from Ron's internal struggles to some outside force in the antagonist. Especially since it just felt like that guy was there just to be there.

***** Exactly! It didn't make much sense to me. But other than that I really enjoyed the fic. I think the author nailed the characterisation of the trio and I loved how they made Ron the balancing factor in the group. It was really plausible and made a lot of sense to me.

** I know a fic kind of like that, but it's a MCU crossover where Ron basically got a adopted by Hawkeye. So I don't know if that's what you're looking for.
