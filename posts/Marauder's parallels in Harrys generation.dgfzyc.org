Harry and Remus I know its more common to make his parallel be James or Lilly and thats not a bad parallel. But Remus is the one who has more of the low key snarky moments like Harry hes also the one playing peace maker more often when Hermione or Ron being more confrontational with each other. Not to say Harry doesnt have a temper but those two are more explosive. Harry is also the one with more secrets to hide even from his friends much like Lupin had to likely hide his werewolfism. Harry is quippy sure but not as in your face as James. Thats more Ron's thing.

Speaking of Ron being like James...ya thats the parallel. Ron has many insecururities sure and that I think hides his talents a bit. That and his bffs overshadowing it. Ron is the most social and the most charismatic. Sure he has some of the biggest asshole moments in the trio but they stand out because his presence is so important to especially Harry. Beyond those moments hes the one who tends to be the most sympathetic towards others feelings. Hes the one who makes Harry feel bettet bout being the heir of slytherin. He's the one who tells Neville he's worth 10 of Malfoy, he's the one who tells off Snape for calling Hermione a know it all. Which kinda parralells James a bit being the best and the worst at the same time.

Hermione is not a Marauder in my opinion but rather Lilly. I know she gets paralleled with Lupin more, but Lupin while mildly exasperated with Sirius and James lets their actions against Snape slide. While Hermione I think would be much more comfortable calling her friends out. And more openly confrontational. She is the one who slaps Malfoy after all. And she also seems much more righteous and stubborn starting the whole SPEW thing which also feels more like Lilly. Plus she has the whole combination of being frustrated by the James parallel ( Ron) while also finding him endearing

So two more Marauders left Sirius and Peter. Kinda inevitable since the Marauders + Lilly did outnumber the trio. The other 2 are like the Marauders that could have been .

First one is Neville as Peter. Or rather Peter could have been like Neville in another life maybe.

While Peter was a Marauder he seemed much less confident and seemed to hero worship or at least look up to the more charismatic members of the Marauders. In the same way Neville did to Harry. But Peter never really got our from the shadow of the others while Neville did. He had the backbone to stand up to them and become confident in his own way. Peter to me is like if Neville had gone wrong.

Similarly to me Sirius is like if Draco had gone right. This stems from my belief that Draco like most kids is very malleable at that age and exposure to different beliefs could have made him turn out to be a very different person. Draco was charismatic and loud and a bit of a Drama King not unlike Sirius, he also had a tendency to bully also not unlike Sirius.

I know people often have Draco and Ron at each others throats even in stories where Draco switches sides or starts out good, but in my opinion given their personality types they actually might have gotten along pretty well found each other fun. Draco like Sirius also has a pretty dark family who he'd have to rebel against had he joined Harry during the school years. They arent exactly the same of course Sirius is braver and more rebellious in my opinion but I definetly see a parralell.

What do you guys think? Would you have different parallels? If so who? And why?


** I don't see many parallels between the trio and the Marauders; they are very different people from wildly different background, and their ingroup dynamics are nothing alike.

I guess I can see some parallels between James and Draco. Both rich, spoiled, entitled bullies who (presumably) grew up and got better with age and would do anything for their families.

*** It is pretty hard to do parallels for James and Lilly especially since most everything you know comes from 1 memory and the opinions of others who are all very biased

But I do see the Draco and James parallel for sure.

I want some of what you are smoking. One is a somewhat spoiled kid who gets into a mutual rivalry, the other one carried out terrorist attacks which violated several laws of warfare.

** I think you can find parallels between any two characters if you try hard enough. For example, you could argue Harry and Remus both are rather self-involved and care more about how things affect them than others.

Ginny and James are relatively similar in their confident attitudes and propensity for mischief and flaunting of the rules.

Ron and Sirius are both fun people who are proud blood traitors.

But do I think any of the above examples are genuinely strong parallels? Nah.

** I've definitely read stories where there are clear parallells between Remus and Hermione, as the two bookish researcher types of their groups. They're both people who might be discriminated against as well (Remus's mother is muggle and he's a werewolf, Hermione muggleborn), but then Hermione is a lot more self-assured in canon than I think Remus ever was.

The characterizations of James and Sirius I prefer are where they are more similar to Fred and George. I feel like they would have been a lot braver than Draco, and had very steadfast beliefs, even if there are perhaps other valid parallells you could draw.

I've always assumed Lily was the one who was similar to Harry behaviour-wise, I feel like that's mentioned in canon?

With Peter Pettigrew, maybe you could compare him to someone like Zacharias Smith, although I suppose he might share an inferiority complex with Ron (best friends are all smarter, more popular etc than him).

** I see very few parallels between Marauders and Harry's DA.

The Marauders were formed to bully and prank fellow students. Therefore, they attracted sycophants like Peter Pettigrew who betrayed them at the most inopportune time.

Harry's DA was formed to specifically oppose those sadistic genocidal magical Nazi scums and their Ministry minions. Despite facing this overwhelming enemy odds, they only suffered one defection from a peripheral member early in their struggle.

As for Draco Malfoy, he was the polar opposite of Sirius Black. Canon Draco was an arrogant, cowardly, entitled, and spoiled brat whose favorite line was “wait until my father hears about this”. He only looked out for himself, and if the going got tough, he would be willing to betray anyone and anything.

You could write him like Sirius in fanfics of course. But that person has little to do with Draco Malfoy in the Books. He is just an OC with Draco's name attached to it.

*** I guess I meant more like personality parallels or follow similar themes or tropes or position in a friend group.

Naturally there isnt a perfect parallel because all these chatacters are very different amd lived under very different circumstances.
