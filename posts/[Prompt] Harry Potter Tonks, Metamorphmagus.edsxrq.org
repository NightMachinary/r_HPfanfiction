After displaying Metamorphmagus capabilities as an infant, living in the muggle world wasn't an option for Harry Potter. The down to earth parents of the only other metamorphmagus in Britain agree to take in the Boy Who Lived and raise him in a loving home.

Possible Variants

- In order to maintain the blood protection Harry must spend at least a few weeks with the Dursleys each summer. The Tonks deal with any mistreatment he might suffer.

-Harry never sees the Dursleys as home and the blood protection fails. Steps must be taken to protect Harry without this.

-Harrys abilities are the "Power He Knows Not" and great pains are taken to hide them from the world. Harry practices with Tonks and becomes a master of disguise and espionage in a way that helps him fight Voldemort.

- Harry's abilities are only thought to be the power, meaning that the secret can come out at some point at Hogwarts without ruining everything.

-Harry doesnt go out in public as a child until he can control his abilities more (eg still wonderful introduction to Diagon Alley and the magical world at large at 11)

-Harry only goes out in disguise as a child. Using charms and disguises provided by his adopted parents when he's young, and metamorphmagus transformations to hide who he is as a teen.
