Fix in which a Harry from an universe hyper-focused in Magic travels to the canon universe I which Magic's use is kind of lackluster. Can be an AU in which everybody has magic, wizards managed to planetary travel, or even a mor D&D world, and he suddenly is thrust in a world in which the supposed best wizards of the age are very much sub-par for the well-trained in his native world. Alternatively it could be time-travel from a much more magically developed time. Even better if he doesn't quite realize it


** Would be better if it was a Harry from a shitty Magic universe traveling into a more advanced magical universe.

*** So, basically canon Harry going to a better world? Yeah, it would also be interesting, but than he would only have to learn that universe's magic and he would be level with everyone else, personally I would prefer the opposite.
