This analysis of the Twins is very good, IMO, although a touch hagiographic (it doesn't mention a bullying, ruthless streak I think occasionally shows).

[[https://sjwmoviereviews.com/2017/08/21/harry-potter-character-analysis-4-fred-george-weasley/]]

It paints a picture of them as being incredibly bright - possibly the smartest of the Weasley siblings, and certainly among the most driven characters in the series. With no intention of compromising their ambitions for the sake of others (yeah.... like their mother's wish to see them in safe Ministry jobs was ever going to happen). But who are still capable of turning their focus onto more important things, like the fight against YKW.

But a point unaddressed is the differences between the two; how does one write them as individuals? I think a trap easily fallen into is to write a story with a single, mischievous, intelligent character whose actions are sometimes done by somebody called Fred, and sometimes done by somebody called George.

How do you avoid that?


** Without any goddamn every-two-words twinspeak.

In all seriousness, I think it's best if they're subtle in their differences. Something that can only be noticed if you know the both of them a lot, you know? At least that's what I like.

I made my Fred just a bit more... thoughtless? Insensitive? I'm not really sure what word to use, because the former makes him appear dumber while the latter makes him look like a jerk. He just blurts things out in a blunt manner more so than George. They're still very alike, but George is a tiny bit more mature in dealing with his friends while Fred's thoughtlessness comes out in both his victims and those he cares about. He also has slightly more freckles.

I agree. For all of their inventions, they were incredibly smart. They just didn't put their intelligence into schoolwork, but rather other things such as the shop. Sure, the other Weasleys all got more O.W.L.S. but I honestly don't think any of them attributed to the war more than the twins, or perhaps /could have/ attributed. The books don't really go much into how Fred and George deal with helping out outside those protective hats. That's a canon thing, right? The protective hats? It's not just a fanfiction invention?

Entirely canon. They were also working on other protective clothing to, iirc.

But the Ministry bought five hundred for all its support staff! And we're still getting massive orders!" ~Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Chapter Six, Draco's Detour, page 119.

The page before also talks about their 'Patented Daydream Charms', which Hermione notes is an impressive bit of magic.

** Personally I have Fred be more rash and talkative and the one who is usually leading the charge, as well as the one who is typically keeping spirits up. George on the other hand has a drier wit, a much more volatile temper, and is a little more cautious and willing to listen to authority. Both, however, are very codependent. George needs Fred to come up with ideas and to lead the way because George ALWAYS does what Fred suggests. Fred needs George to rein him in and remind him that actions have consequences.

Alone, Fred would quickly go manic and drive everyone away. George on the other hand would wander aimlessly without real purpose or direction.

** Well, one way is to go back to the books and look at their dialogue. See if there are any differences in the way each of them speaks. Or, as [[/u/AutumnSouls]] says, invent the differences. Give them specific traits that they can express differently whenever they're not playing off of each other.

One way to look at the twins is them being BFFs that grew up together. They are each other's best friend, sticking with each other through thick and thin. They went on adventures together, they play pranks together, and they probably talk about a lot of sensitive stuff together. These are two people that are often on the same wavelength when it comes to ideas. They can - sometimes - finish each other's sentences because they can follow the other twin's train of thought. They CANNOT finish each other's sentences five times in the same sentence. They are two very good friends with a similar (NOT identical) sense of humor that can play off of each other very well. They speak in complete sentences, but can ping pong back and forth if you don't get a word in.

So, different people, similar interests. Maybe George likes potions while Fred likes Transfiguration. Maybe they both hate charms but Fred is good at it so they use it anyway. Maybe George does most of the talking when they're alone. Etc, etc.

** I have George as the more serious and quiet twin of the two. Fred is the one who thinks of what needs to be done and George is the one to figure out to do what Fred has ideas for.

And yeah I don't do the twin speak, I mean it was funny in the series but after seeing it done in fanfiction so many times I don't do it because after a while it gets annoying.

I also have them good at different subjects. George is good at potions, Charms and Herbology.

Fred is good at Transfiguration's, Defense, and Astronomy.

They are hard working on things that they like to do, but they also aren't afraid of getting down and dirty by doing things that aren't necessarily fun. As long as it helps them or others that they care about.

They are loyal to their family, but to them Percy betrayed them the moment he sided with the Ministry over his parents. It took George a while to really forgive Percy after Fred's death.

They can both hold grudges, although George is the more level headed one at times anyway.

Fred isn't afraid to speak his mind, landing himself in some serious trouble in the progress. They're bold, daring, dedicated to different things.

They aren't doing something to get rich or to live comfortably, they're doing it to enjoy themselves. I see them as being the kind of people who think you only live once so why waste it doing something you hate kind of thinking.

**** They're both Gryffindor, obviously but Fred is the more... reckless I suppose you can call it of the two. (At least how I see them).

** Yeah, they are individuals if you look at it.

Fred is more rash, and he has more of a temper on him, as well as some of the nastier ideas - it was him Ron was doing the Unbreakable Vow with, it was him that Transfigured Ron's teddy into that spider, and it was him that hit Ron's Puffskein with the Bludger bat.

George is softer. He's normally the first to ask if Harry's alright, and he's very sociable - think of his asking out Angelina for the Yule Ball.

This doesn't mean one is good and one is bad! Both work together in being savagely cruel at times, and both are really kind - as much as Free has a nasty streak, he's very gentle about daubing on cream for Hermione's eye after she picks up the Punching Telescope.

The two ARE very intelligent, and they're also used to being separate from the rest of the family. Think about Molly's prefect talk, "That's everyone in the family!" --- "What are me and Fred? Next-door neighbours?"

For various reasons, I think Percy and Ron often feel the most left-out of the family, but the twins seem to feel the most APART from the family, which is slightly different, and adds to the reason they spend so much time together.

Also, people can tell them apart. Harry always knows Fred and George apart when speaking to them, and they're identical twins, but there's differences between them. Fred and George likely do change clothes or catch people by surprise when people are busy or distracted, though, like they did in the PS King's Cross scene with Molly.

*** On topic, I interchange names of Padma and Parvati in my fic series on a regular basis to my own chagrin, despite them having different personalities and niches. I imagine it's the same for the twins, though they get less exposure in my work so it'd be hard to tell. But I tend to write one twin as more hard working, less socially apt and more driven, and the other a bit more of a salesman/socialite with less drive to work, but maybe a bit more creative.

** Am I the only one that doesn't really like them too much? They're... well, dicks. They bully their siblings, especially Percy but also Ginny. And the fact that they don't listen to their parents isn't always a good thing. It is, however, what siblings do (play games, tease etc). I could be pretty nasty with my siblings but what makes me uncomfortable is all the readers approving of/glossing over what they do.

As an adult, someone with a lot of siblings and even a twin of my own, I don't know. Sure, they can be nice and independent but they are pretty nasty too. If I had those two as siblings I'd tear them to pieces.

Back to the question! I've never seen them as individuals myself. They're like Huey, Dewey and Louie, where even the authors think of them as the same person. It's easier to take initiative if there's more than one of you and you can spur each other on. Also, you have more hands, feet and brains which is another advantage. Imagine how the twins would be recieved in the books if everything happened like it did but instead of two characters, it was just one.
