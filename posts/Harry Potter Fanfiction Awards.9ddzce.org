Every so often I see a fic with a note in the summary that it won the "Such and Such award." I've always had a vague knowledge that there are fanfiction awards, but I'm having trouble finding out which HP awards are still active. I'm really curious and would appreciate some direction. Thanks!


** Although HPFF is currently in process of rejuvenation, they have had the 'Dobby' awards for ages.

The HPFanfictalk forums & archives (for HP, other fandoms and OF) have the overall F.R.O.G.S awards, as well as the 4 houses each have their own internal mini monthly and annual awards.

** There are a lot of Facebook groups (like Harmony & Co, Grimmuald Place, Harry Potter Fanfiction, and so on) that do competitions, usually around holidays and such.

** I have a few awards from SIYE and Mugglenet. I don't take them too seriously, but they are a nice recognition from others that your writing is of a decent quality. I take the SIYE ones more seriously because they are by popular vote and SIYE has a decent audience. MNFF not so much becayse the site is essentially dead, but they were the site I went on way back so i have a soft spot for them.

** It's just different communities clapping each other on the back.

This may come across as overly cynical. I'm not mocking such awards, it's almost certainly a good way to keep everyone engaged and makes interaction more interesting within those communities. Just saying that if you don't know an award it's probably meaningless to you.
