So we're all presumably familiar with the idea of such-and-such character dying and then waking up at the start of the series with a mind to fix the future that is to come; usually it's Harry, one of his yearmates, or occasionally one of the adults (usually Snape in that instance). So I'm wondering if any stories out there have that same premise, but use Dobby as the one with future-knowledge.


** A Dobby time travel fic? That sounds really cool. Hope there's something like this!

** /Harry --- We're coming to get you. See you soon. -R/

They kept sending him letters saying they would come get him if they didn't hear back. Harry was hoping they meant it.

He dreamed that the Weasleys were outside his window on brooms, ready to take him away. They knocked on the window, he couldn't open it but it was unlocked. "It's unlocked," Harry muttered. "You can open it..."

He opened his eyes. Moonlight was shining through the window, and someone was goggling at him: a freckle-faced, red-haired, long-nosed, visibly depressed someone.

Ron Weasley was outside Harry's Window.

"Ron!" whispered Harry excitedly, moving quickly to the window to open it, "Do you have a broom for me--flying car." Harry nodded at the three Weasleys in a flying car, absolutely nothing unusual about this situation. Ron had his hands propped on the back window. Grinning at him from the front seats were Fred and George.

"Alright, Harry?" the red-haired Weasley twins asked at the same time.

"Getting better." he replied

"You've been getting my letters, right?" said Ron

"Yes. Hedwig's been locked in her cage for ages!" said Harry

"You could have used Errol." said Ron

"My quills and parchment are locked up too!" said Harry

"You could have done something makeshift." said Ron

"Shut up, Ron." said the twins, thankfully.

"But I knew you were planning on coming, I didn't think it would be so soon!"

"Well we had this flying car, see" said Fred

"And Ron's been all torn up about Scabbers," added George

"And he said he wanted to do something reckless." ended Fred

"What's this about Scabbers?" asked Harry

"Don't worry about that," said the twins, again at once, "You said your stuff is locked up? Do you need help with it?"

"Yes, but it's locked in the cupboard under the stairs."

"Easy, no problem." said George, and after Fred maneuvered the car to allow them to both climb in through the window. "We'll get your trunk-Ron, help Harry--Harry, grab whatever you need and hand it to Ron." whispered George. Fred was about to head out the door when he seemed to realize something, and George as well, as both were now looking at Hedwig's cage. Fred moved quickly to it "A lot of wizards think Muggle tricks are a waste of time, but we feel they're skills worth learning." There was a small /click/ and Hedwig's cage opened, and she made a quiet appreciative chirp before soaring through the window.

Moments later, Fred was back in the car and George and Harry were working with the trunk to get it through the window. "/Pivot/" muttered George, "/You pivot/" muttered Fred back. When it was finally through, Harry gave a once-over to his room. Nothing on his bed, nothing on his table, nothing to say to Uncle Vernon standing in the door, nothing on the floor. He started to reach for Ron and George's hands when he froze and turned. Vernon was still standing there quietly, and Harry, absolutely unsure of what to do, gave a very small, very slow, very apprehensive wave, then grabbed the Weasley's hands, got in the car, and as a passing politeness, shut his bedroom window.

"I find this perfectly acceptable." said Vernon, closing the door.

As the car flew away, Harry was feeling bemused about his uncle until he remembered something.

"Ron, what happened with Scabbers?"

"Yeah Ron, tell him your bad dream." said Fred

"Scabbers ran away." said George

"Or crawled off somewhere to die." said Fred

"No he didn't!" Ron angrily replied, "A house elf apparated into my room, grabbed Scabbers, /murdered him/ by breaking him in /half/ and apparated away with his body!"

/Weird dream/, thought Harry. "I'm sorry, Ron. That must have been hard."

  (alt title: Disproportionate response). Give the death-eaters a second chance? No way, not even a *first* chance! This is a "redo" fic with a twist. The pairing will eventually be Harmony but a good part of the story happens when they are too young so hard-core Harmonians need to be patient. Rated M for possible violence in later chapters.

** u/EpicDaNoob:
#+begin_quote
  usually Snape in that instance
#+end_quote

This intrigues me. A portrayal of Snape that shows his complex character without whitewashing, mixed up with time travel, seems like it could make an interesting fic. Do you have any good recs for this?

Edit: also, sorry to put a request in a request thread. And BTW you may want to post your idea as a prompt too.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.
