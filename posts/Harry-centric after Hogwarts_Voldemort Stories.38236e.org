I haven't actually read any HP Fanfiction in at least two years but I got reminded of that fact recently after seeing recommendations for HPMOR on other subreddits and that led to me craving a story that I could only track down a couple good fanfics on. Specifically I'm wondering if there have been any thing of note on the subject of post Voldemort and after Hogwarts, or maybe final year, stories that follow Harry when not burdened with all the baggage. Preferably more positive than negative but anything will work.

Side note, I recognize HPMOR is a fairly impressive piece of work for fanfiction but it is far from the best, and a fair distance from just good, especially in comparison to published fiction. Don't be that guy/girl.

*** I notice that there is a prequel up as well. Do you recommend that I read it first, before reading the story you linked?

**** I'd go publication order. It's a fun old fic and you kind of have the Star Wars â€˜start in the middle' thing. You don't get why everything is the way it is, but it's a fun ride finding out. If you loved the series the prequel is there for you.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8554615/1/The-Lost-Summer][The Lost Summer]]: Harry won the war! So, why is he sitting all alone at Grimmauld Place while everyone else is off celebrating, or planning his life? Well, maybe it's time our hero took a little vacation and enjoyed the lost summer.

*** This was a good quick read, thanks for linking.

My only complaint is that the story is in need of proofreading. I realize the author mentioned in a note that it was written in 48 hours, but it wouldn't hurt to spell check.

** Do you mind the Drarry pairing? If not:

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/879599/chapters/1692075][Reparations/Foundations]] (I always end at the end of Foundations though technically there is more, I just found this to be the most preferable length) - Harry is a Healer-in-training and his new assignment is the rehabilitation ward and guess who heads it? Deals with post-war subjects and magical drug addiction, quite fascinating and a lovely relationship build in my opinion.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/218544/chapters/328702][The Lodger]] - Harry is living alone after the war ended, he has PTSD and depression, he decides to take on a tenant. When Draco, who is on the run, applies, he lets him stay. A short one but one I enjoy nonetheless. It deals with mental illness and yeah, post-war situations.

[[http://www.hdhols.com/ms_mindfunk.html][Squib]] - Harry is a teacher at a school for magically challenged kids that he started with Hermione. Guess whose kid turns out to be magically challenged? Bit of a deus ex whatever in the ending but pleasant anyway. Nice to see different jobs/passions for these characters.

I have a few more post-war ones but from Draco's perspective, let me know if you want them.
