***** Lily and James knew that Wormtail was the traitor, since they were the one who decided on him as the secret keeper.

Edit: Sorry I misread your comment. Still, I'd argue since Hagrid had no idea about Sirius, why would Dumbledore? and he sure as hell wouldn't start his opening gambit with murder either way.

******* Still, Dumbledores first thought wouldnt be "oh goody, murder time", he'd detain him. Remus is less certain, but I'm not convinced he would 100% start off with murder.

Particularly since this all involves those character somehow finding this out, which involves the Potters informing them, yet also not being simultaneously informed of Peter's treachery.

** The babysitter is left on the floor, dead. Lily and James are heartbroken and scared as they rush up the stairs. Baby Harry is alive! But ...Lily and James are both REALLY sure they only had one kid before the left for the night. Where did this other one come from? With no time to wait Lily scoops them both up and checks them over, within minutes full warm bottles are being sucked on and the two babies start drifting to sleep.

They don't know what happened. No one does, not even Dumbledore who seems to be pleased but confused himself. "Take care of him," is all the old headmaster would say.

Voldemort planned on killing Harry in cold blood but he never expected the magic of an innocent child to protect him as such. A part of his soul is ripped out, no by his doing for once, and and is set on attaching to this child.

But it doesn't. Magic won't have that and instead he grows into something. Baby Harry can feel sadness and hopelessness. Anger too. He does what any other babe might try and reaches out to try to help and, using a bit of his own innocent magic, gives a part of himself to the soul piece.

Such a simple gesture of help and love can effect even the hardest of hearts. And magic can sense when something wrong has been done and tries to correct all of her mistakes.

Ands that's how on that night Lily and James go home and end up with baby Harry and his slightly younger, but more pouty, twin brother Henry Potter. Who is of course actually Voldemorts soul piece who grows up to love and be loved.

*** Years passed and the boys grew and matured. Henry, ex-Dark Lord turned ever the loving brother, did everything he could to protect the family that he loved and was loved by so much. Midnight forays into the family libraries of Potter and Black Manor. Slipping advanced magic texts into Harry's belongings. Manipulating the adults in their life to teach them magic early, all the while making sure that when it finally comes time for him to pass that his brother is fine.

Henry destroying all the Horcrux's during their early childhood. Tricking the Death Eaters into giving him vault access by making her think that he's Voldemort possessing the Boys-Who-Lived. Draining their vaults dry and claiming Hufflepuff's cup from the Lestrange vault.

Coming clean to his parents one day when he was six about his true nature had him blood-adopted that very night to give him access to Potter Family Magicks. Claiming his Scion Ring beside Harry on their 11 birthday while Harry claims his Heir Rings for the Potter and Gryffindor families with their triplet little sisters Rose, Marigold, and Belladonna watching on excitedly. Adopting Harry into the Slytherin family (without his knowledge ) making him a parselmouth, his heir, and fulfilling the United line requirements of laid down by the last Lord Peverell concerning the Potters and the Gaunts.

Convincing Harry to join him in Slytherin while simultaneously convincing Ron, Hermione, and Neville that cunning and ambition doesn't equal evil. (Later on enlightening Draco from his skewed, bigoted views on Muggle-borns and the other Hogwarts houses.)

Convincing their Slytherin year-mates to be more social outside the house and to leave their bigotry behind with their ignorance. Spreading the word that Dark doesn't equal evil. Leading their year mates through charisma, power, and the fame of being the Boys-Who-Lived.

Destroying the Diary-crux the day it enters the Hogwarts wards and becoming secret dueling apprentices to Professor Flitwick. Both of them joining the quidditch team as chasers letting Draco become seeker. Henry “discovering” the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets and Harry's ability for parselmagic.

Becoming Kings Slytherin House in their third year while taking every class via time turner. Their sisters becoming Ravenclaws. Peter ascaping Azkaban and rejoining the shade of Voldemort at the end of the year.

Both entering the Goblet of Fire as fourth years. Having all their numerous close friends and family know they entered but covering for them anyways. Henry training Harry harder than he's ever been trained before. Both of them now having access to the Potter, Black, Gryffindor, and Slytherin Family Grimoires. Beating Fleur and Viktor to the cup and facing a revived Voldemort. Harry fights the Death Eaters while Henry fights his Prime Soul Piece.

In a battle that goes down in the history books two 14-year-olds take on the most powerful Dark Lord in the last 500 years and his most loyal followers. Harry, tearing through the Dark Lord's ranks, was in awe at the power his twin displayed while dueling the Dark Lord. Elemental, parsel, and Family Magicks flowing from the yew and phoenix feather wand taken from the Dark Lord himself like water through a pressure cleaner. While he himself was no slouch in those 3 area's of magic he stopped recognizing everything cast when they changed from high level battle transfiguration to high level dark curses. Finishing up with the last loyal death eater he joined the duel. While Henry switched to using only high level parsel and dark Magicks, Harry harried the Dark Wanker with a combination of elemental and Family Magicks sprinkled in with a bit of battle transfiguration. Voldemort snarling in frustration took to the skies with Henry following. Harry just smirked, and turned into a black and emerald green thunderbird.

Finish it...

**** I see it now. Didn't read all the comments.

What's your own idea from where the second Harry came from?

I'm going to go with alternate timeline, where the altPotters tried to send their Harry to a safer timeline but the portal they had set up gets distorted when Voldemort attacks. The interaction between the portal and both Voldemort's casting killing curses end with both dying along with the altPotters.

***** I didn't have any particular hypothesis in mind, I was just reading an old thread on twin Potter stories and the notion popped into my head. Some weird quirk of magic that caused the perfect replication of Harry, right down to the soul.

Perhaps I'll have a proper brainstorming session on it at some point.
