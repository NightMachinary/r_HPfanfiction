#+TITLE: I’m looking for a good fanfiction during the founders age that doesn’t have any of the main characters in it. I want it to be just during that time.

** ... okay so this is /exactly/ what I'm currently working on. Founders era, no time travel, focused on early life at Hogwarts and the way it interacts with some of the muggle world political events happening at that time.

I'm about 20,000 words deep so far and am trying to make sure the first few chapters are polished and ready to post. I was probably going to post the first chapter within a week - would you like me to message you a link once it's up so you can check it out?
