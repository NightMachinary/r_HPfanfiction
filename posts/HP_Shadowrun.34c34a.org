*** WTF... I read that this past weekend and I can't remember the name. But yeah, Dudley accidentally turns Harry into a greater dragon and the centaurs all freak out because the greater dragons weren't supposed to return yet according to the stars. Also Harry eats the lawnmower.

***** Never found it in my history... /but/ [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/33lwb9/lf_harry_as_a_dragon_can_be_femharry_too/cqm5zbj][I did find original comment that linked me to it]]

I would link the story directly, but I think the comment is funny enough to warrant a read on its own.

Summary: It began with a quirk of timing. It continued because dragons, such as what 8-year-old Harry Potter just turned into, are large and difficult to control. Fortunate for everyone he's a nice kid, eh? Shadowrun and Rifts crossover. You have now been warned.
