I'm looking for any Harry Potter fanfiction that references but preferably include the fae. The summer and winter queen especially, Maeve and Aurora too. Generally anything including the fae as a separate supernatural entity. I think this big in Dresden, but I'm not familiar with that world.

I'm aware of Circular Reasoning and Partially Kissed Hero


** You're aware of Partially Kissed Hero?

My deepest sympathies.

Also, if you want something with fae that's not a Dresden cross: linkffn(Grimm: A Fairy's Tale)

  Pre-Hogwarts. The stuff of legends, myth and majesty were the realm of the Fey long before wizards named him Boy Who Lived. Maeve of the Unseelie Court has decided to take one of wizarding kind's myths, to shape as her own. Vastly AU.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

****** That's why I said "in that particular form". If you have seen Aurora and Maeve as the young summer/winter faerie queen names elsewhere, please quote a source. To my knowledge, Dresden Files is the only one to have taken and twisted the idea of Robert Graves' "Triple Goddess" (Mother, Maiden and Crone) and turned them into faerie queens, naming the youngest Maeve and Aurora. It just kinda surprised me that OP wanted stories featuring Maeve and Aurora as the young faerie queens without having read Dresden Files, as that's where those characters originate from.

******* The name Aurora has been associated with Fae Royalty before: Princess Aurora is the real name of The Sleeping Beauty (ballet) by Tchaikovsky, who in the non-Disneyfied version is much more magical and otherworldly (the court itself is made up of fairy tale characters.)

  After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness. But despite having gained great power in exchange for a bargain with the hidden Fae, she is still unable to kill the immortal Dark Lord. As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.
