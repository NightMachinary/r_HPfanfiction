Could anyone please help me remember the title and the author of this Snarry fanfiction? The war is over and everyone is back in school. They are in potion class when Ron start again a debate against Slytherin and Harry said something like "I know for a fact that Slytherin has feeling". Everyone then think Harry is dating a Slytherin, Draco Malfoy. But he said something like "potter is a scrawny thing but his boyfriend is scary". The boyfriend at the end is Snape.\\
I don't remember anything else and I am losing my head trying to find this story.\\
Sorry for my poor English, it's not my native language.\\
Thank you!


** So is it like teacher/student?

*** Yes but I seem to remember that the students like Harry, Ron, Draco and Hermione are at Hogwarts because they skipped a year because of the war. It was Blaise to start thinking Harry and Draco are dating, I seem to remember that Hermione ask Draco if Harry is any good in the sack :) at the end Snape answer this question.
