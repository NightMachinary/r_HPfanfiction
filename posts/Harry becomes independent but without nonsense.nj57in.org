I'd like to see Independent!Harry fics but without all the Lord Potter-Black, heir of all four founders, massively rich and naturally powerful crap. I want to see Harry become independent through hard work and maybe a bit of help from the funds his parents left him, but no lordship or any other boon coming out of nowhere. I definitely don't want to see 11 year olds discussing serious politics. Please /no/ slash, no or minimum romance - certainly no harems - and only complete or those that update regularly, and by regularly I mean at /least/ once a week. Preferably takes place before the 5th year.


** I know a couple of fics like that - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11692854/1/Bolt-Fashion][Bolt Fashion]] (Harry is an entrepreneur) and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11933512/1/The-House-of-Potter-Rebuilt][The House of Potter Rebuilt]] (Harry is more proactive, and he researches and learns magic just to rebuild his house. Literally). It's been a long time since I read them, but they're some of my most favourite fics in the fandom.

*** I adore The House of Potter Rebuilt. It opens with Harry cleverly noticing that Ron has a lot of chocolate frog cards for someone without a lot of money. Where did the cards come from? Manipulative!Dumbledore? Chemtrails? Bill Gates' vaccine microchips? Then it's revealed that older family members passed down their collections and the entire rest of the fic is about Harry studying architecture. It's the inverse of the usual normal fic interrupted by Goblin Blood Test™ idiocy.

** Closest I can think of from the top of my head is “The Hidden Kingdom” which started with this premise with Harry basically moving out to a nearby empty field as a kid and essentially using DIY stuff and a part time job to live on, he was a bit overly mature but up to the point it was abandoned there was zero talk or even interest in politics whatsoever (plus Gringotts was just a place where you could get a vault to keep your stuff instead of some super op government building, which is always nice). Regarding the actual story mechanics it was also surprisingly realistic, like, I can actually see a smart and resourceful kid doing those kind of things -not without reason, mind you, but with the kind of situation he was in and his available resources it wouldn't be impossible. The only nod to nobility was actually just a really cool and inconsequential bit of family history in which they were descendants from the last king of the English dynasty preceding the current one, even if he wanted to (which he doesn't) he couldn't really do anything with this knowledge, the Potters themselves made sure no one outside the family would know and the only real thing it changed was that every Potter had the first name of someone from the royal family, eg. Harry=Henry, James, Charlus=Charles... so basically just a nice bit of world building.

****** A couple, try to rec a few of the least well-known stories that I feel need some more love whenever the subject shows up. From the top of my head “Harry gets motivated” on ffn is hardly discussed but has the best training montage I've ever seen, “A Wizard's guide to Banking” is very cool, “The Closer you Look” and “prodigal delinquent” are both excellent portrayals of an overpowered, chaotic neutral Harry who is still a kid and /acts/ as such; “Prediction, no thank you!” is my go to for a wholesome story about personal growth and friendship while the “Mischief Heir” series by Mad_Faerie on AO3 (while with hints of bashing that thankfully never go too far) is one I read every time I feel like reading about some good space exploration along with the first 3/4 give or take from Darth Mars' “Invencible” and of course there is also “To Conquer” (crossover with Stargate, SG1 if I'm not mistaken) and pretty much everything ever written by Taure... really, tons of suggestions depending on the subject, naturally won't really be of any help in other cases, I had my fill and got sick and tired of muggle-wanking very early on, so not only do I prefer to focus on stories with as little muggle influence as possible but also actively try to forget those, the same for classical Edgy/Indy!Harry (classical 'cause there are sometimes diamonds in the rough which are worth reading) with the added problem of them just kind off blending together. Also really not interested in angst, if I want to feel bad about life I just have google what is the new disaster the president of my country is trying to put us into.

Same. I've never been interested in a muggle-wank. They are just soo ugh. Like why the heck would I care about anything muggle or their ways when we have a whole world of magic to be explored. I love magical world, world building fics, but good ones are hard to come by or they haven't been updated or been abandoned

Yeah I've read all of Taure stuff at this point who hasn't. I'd just wish Taure would update frequently but we cannot rush the genius, so I will be impatiently waiting and grateful that we have great fan fiction writers that like to write what I love to read.

** That's one huge ask. I don't think the fic you're looking for exists. Just finding complete fics without kid politicians is hard enough, but no power wank or harems either? How about your own pet unicorn while were at it...

Actually, this one might be close linkffn(Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them)

No riches, no 'kewl' powers, no romance and definitely no politics. It's even complete. The problem is that while Harry is definitely independent; lives alone, doesn't let anyone tell him what to do, is easily competent enough to be able to do his own thing, he ISN'T 'independent!' Harry by any stretch...

**** independent!Harry is cool (according to fourteen year olds), he probably has custom robes, a wand holster and maybe a tricked out suitcase that he could live in if he wanted to. But probably doesn't because he also has his own mansion.

Despite his frequent douchiness, people generally like idependent!Harry, he seems to rapidly become fast friends with a lot of people a surprisingly large number of whom are rich snobby purebloods.

independent!Harry eats his wheaties, goes jogging and practices magic every morning. This regimen is so effective that 3 weeks after he starts his new training montage, he can simultaneously defeat multiple competent adult wizards in a sorcerous duel.

​

Plain old independent Harry has control over his life, which is pretty impressive given that he's only a child.

** Linkffn(Sing a requiem) is my, rather odd, recommendation for "Harry becomes independent".

This independence is initially rather unwilling on Harry's part; forced on him by Hermione and Ron but Harry's growth and eventual independence is really touching. Romance plays a small part. And this fic starts sometime in sixth year.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11126195/1/No-Competition]]) he's pretty naturally powerful, but he's still just a kid, and he doesn't really purposefully do anything; there are some passive effects at play, though.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3983128/1/Culture-Shock]]) a The Culture crossover, Harry's not so special, other than being the only magical they have.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7161848/1/893]]) mafia!Harry, he's a badass, but not a terribly overpowered badass.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8186071/1/Harry-Crow]]) goblin raised!Harry; the goblins do some political stuff, but Harry isn't really directly involved in it, and there's no dating until 4th year and the ball.

That's a hard one; that's all I've got, off the top of my head. The Arithmancer is Hermione-centric, but it would work otherwise. Everything else I can think of starts with harry already grown up, more or less.

  It was a bone-deep almost-ache when he opened his eyes and spotted the light flitting through the slats of his cupboard, both a familiar sight and at the same time distant like an old memory. It was a twist in his chest when he sat up, expecting---strangely---to hit his head on the sloped ceiling only to pause when he realized, of course, that he was far too short for that to happen. Harry was struck with a strong sensation---which had no apparent reason at all---that he should not be here.---In which Harry Potter returns to his 11 year-old body after “dying” in the Forbidden Forest, given a second chance to change the ending of his story and the fate of the wizarding world. Except with the memories of his previous life buried deep in his subconscious, Harry must rely on his ever-present sense of deja-vu to guide him down a different path.
