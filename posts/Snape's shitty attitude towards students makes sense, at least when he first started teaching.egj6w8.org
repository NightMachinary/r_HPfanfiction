I was reading [[http://members.madasafish.com/%7Ecj_whitehound/Fanfic/birthdates.htm][this]] after skimming through book 5 when Umbridge was interviewing Snape. If Snape was 21 when he started teaching then some of his oldest students when 1st-3rd years during his 7th year, and the 7th years in the 81-82 year were 1st years during Snape's OWLs in 75/76 and knew/saw the bullying and the fallout between the Marauders and Lily, which could explain the attitude, at least at first. He definitely should have outgrown it by the time Harry and co came to Hogwarts though. A 21-year-old teacher acting like that to 15-17-year-olds is unprofessional, but a thirty-one-year-old should know better than that.

Here's the full quote:

"If Snape was born in 1960, which seems definite given what we're told in Deathly Hallows, then he started teaching when he was twenty-one (we don't know if he was made Head of House at that age, but presumably the fact that Snape became Potions master means Slughorn had retired). In his first teaching-year, the fifth, sixth and seventh-year students had all been already at Hogwarts when he was a student, and presumably knew him as Snivellus, the bullies' favourite victim. That is, the students who were in first, second and third years during Snape's seventh year in 1977/78 would be respectively in fifth, sixth and seventh years in academic year 1981/82.

Worse, the students who were seventh years in 1981/82 had been first years in 1975/76, the year of Snape's OWLs. That means that when he joined the staff he was teaching a seventh-year class who not only were not much younger than himself, but who had (at least potentially) witnessed him being stripped and hung upside-down. It's not surprising he developed a hostile, defensive attitude to his students."

Thoughts?


** Another thing to consider is that Snape is called one of the greatest potions masters, and he's a creator at heart. Imagine someone like Marco Pierre White teaching 11 year olds how to chop vegetables. (And the answer to the question “What would I get if I combined salt, water, flour, and egg?” Being “I don't know.”)

My head cannon is that Snape cannot even leave Hogwarts because a lot of the free death eaters kinda hate him and would like to kill him, and if Dumbledore wasn't protecting him he'd be in prison anyway.

It's said that he would prefer the defence against the dark arts class, and with his history I can imagine Snape wanting to guide students away from the darkness that ruined his life, and to teach them about fighting and spells and stuff. Not excusing his behaviour, but it's not as cut and dry as the books make it out the be when you think about it.

HBP Chapter 21 Having wasted a lot of time worrying aloud about Apparition, Ron was now struggling to finish a viciously difficult essay for Snape that Harry and Hermione had already completed. Harry fully expected to receive low marks on his, because he had disagreed with Snape on the best way to tackle Dementors, but he did not care: Slughorn's memory was the most important thing to him now.

******* My best guess would be, Snape said "Apparate away" Harry said "Cast the Patronus Charm."

I am not a Snape fan. In fact, I could go so far as saying I hate him as a person. On the other hand, I love him as a character. He's a terrible person.

If my guess about what Harry and Snape disagree on about how to handle dementors is correct, then Harry is wrong.

Most adult wizards cannot cast a patronus. It is an extremely rare ability that not even most NEWT level Defense or Charms specialists learn. The overwhelming majority of adult witches and wizards can apparate. Statistically speaking the average witch or wizard when facing a dementor will be unable to cast the patronus, but will be able to apparate, hell maybe even side-along someone else who can't. Also, splinching can be fixed. Getting your soul sucked out can't.

Except Harry proved in the previous book that most wizards /can/ cast a patronus via the DA. In that sense, Harry is basing his opinion on better information than Snape. Snape thinks that the patronus is some ultra-rare charm that only the best of the best can ever perform, but Harry knows better, having recently taught it to a room full of teenagers, many of whom managed to produce corporeal patronuses.

At the first lesson Snape was being mean to Harry, no question about it.

**** Just finished learning that according to the books Snape took a total of 277 points across the series. His most typical number taken is 10 points, his average is a little under 14. This was 19 point deductions over 12 occasions.

McGonagall took a total 235. Most typically 50, an average of 29. This was 8 point deductions over 5 occasions.

From this, plus the fact that Harry just doesn't like Snape and whines about him often we can see that he isn't nearly as bad as fan fiction makes him out. The more you learn.

Harry has good reason to dislike Snape and that's without the prophecy stuff. And I've never seen point deductions as an argument against Snape. It's the other stuff he does. Tbh, if fan fiction isn't writing Snape as a brainless murderer it's hard to make him worse than what he was.

His behavior to his students is atrocious and only excusable (to me) if you think that he had to act that way to keep up the death eater persona around his "friends" kids.

But, we aren't talking about that in this post. I can only imagine how horrible it would be to teach kids that witnessed or tried to join in on your bullying, much less being physically exposed to them and then trying to gain their respect as a teacher. I'm studying to become a teacher rn and I also volunteer with young-ish kids. Due to my circumstances I may easily end up teaching at my old highschool or in the same district and I may become these kids teacher one day. I have no doubt I would be extremely angry if something happened to me like it did to Snape and then I had to go teach my previous classmates or their little siblings.

Honestly, if I was in that situation I would never teach in my district. Poor Snape (even though he made many bad decisions) doesn't have a choice. It sucks.

** Another thing to consider is that while Defence is dangerous, it's not as dangerous as potions. You are brewing things that, if brewed wrong, could accidentally kill someone, or do something just as bad.

While I'm not condoning Snape's behavior towards people like Harry or Neville; the way he acted there was VERY unprofessional, it does make some sort of sense why he's such an hard ass, because he isn't wanting anyone to accidentally die.

This is the same man who made sure Harry's broom didn't kill him, this is the same man who was suspicious of Quirrell, this is the same man who went to the Shrieking Shack in Harry's third year, he had no reason to believe that Sirius was innocent, and yes, he didn't care when he realized eventually that Sirius was in fact innocent, but he went to a dangerous place, to protect Harry and his friends.

***** Snape was talking to Lily and James butted in. Snape retaliated and James couldn't handle it.

The full convo:

“But we're going!” he said, unable to suppress the exhilaration in his voice. “This is it! We're off to Hogwarts!”

She nodded, mopping her eyes, but in spite of herself, she half smiled.

“You'd better be in Slytherin,” said Snape, encouraged that she had brightened a little.

“Slytherin?”

One of the boys sharing the compartment, who had shown no interest at all in Lily or Snape until that point, looked around at the word, and Harry, whose attention had been focused entirely on the two beside the window, saw his father: slight, black-haired like Snape, but with that indefinable air of having been well-cared-for, even adored, that Snape so conspicuously lacked.

“Who wants to be in Slytherin? I think I'd leave, wouldn't you?”

James asked the boy lounging on the seats opposite him, and with a jolt, Harry realized that it was Sirius. Sirius did not smile.

“My whole family have been in Slytherin,” he said.

“Blimey,” said James, “and I thought you seemed all right!”

Sirius grinned.

“Maybe I'll break the tradition. Where are you heading, if you've got the choice?”

James lifted an invisible sword.

“ ‘Gryffindor, where dwell the brave at heart!' Like my dad.”

Snape made a small, disparaging noise. James turned on him.

“Got a problem with that?”

“No,” said Snape, though his slight sneer said otherwise. “If you'd rather be brawny than brainy ---”

“Where're you hoping to go, seeing as you're neither?” interjected Sirius.

James roared with laughter. Lily sat up, rather flushed, and looked from James to Sirius in dislike.

“Come on, Severus, let's find another compartment.”

“Oooooo . . .”

James and Sirius imitated her lofty voice; James tried to trip Snape as he passed.

"Retaliated" suggests that having your conversation interrupted is the same as attacking the intelligence of an entire house. They are decidedly not.

We don't know if the First war had already started but these things don't start in a vacuum. We do know that less than five years later the First war is bad enough that Lily refers to Riddle as /You Know Who/.

***** Oh sure, blame Sirius for Snape not being able to keep his nose out of other people's business and trying to get Lupin killed. Sirius' was shitty in this regard because he risked Lupin's life and future; Snape's situation is of his own making. He knew that wherever Lupin was going, the school staff knew about it. Here's the quote from the 3rd book.

#+begin_quote
  anyway Snape had seen me crossing the grounds with Madam Pomfrey one evening as she led me toward the Whomping Willow to transform. Sirius thought it would be --- er --- amusing, to tell Snape all he had to do was prod the knot on the tree trunk with a long stick, and he'd be able to get in after me.

And Sirius growing past his upbringing has nothing at all to do with Snape. Sirius was brought up in an abusive household that spewed bigotry. He grew past them when he disavowed their beliefs, left home and fought against the genocidal terrorists rather than join them.

Moving from hating all mixed blood/muggle born to hating all slytherins (11 year olds sorted by a magical hat) is still bigotry. I'm not seeing that as a lot of personal growth.

There's also a part about how generally people who hate Snape are children, childish adults, or people who had bad experiences with similar teachers. And people who understand his greyness are adults, or prematurely jaundiced (prematurely cynical), and that they resonate with the difficulty of teaching, double crossing, dealing with annoying children, and the complexity of human character.

Sorry, but I have to call BS on that. Being a strict teacher is one thing. (See Mcgonagall for example). Snape is just an abusive arsehole. He mocked Hermione for her teeth instead of helping and threatened to poison Neville's toad. And he never explains how to do stuff- he just tells his students to do it and then gets angry when they do something wrong.

I can maybe sympathize with Snape up until he graduates. But after that? He's just a grown-up bully. I see nothing "childish" about hating abusive teachers. Mind you he thought 11-year-old children. He was Neville's biggest fear. 11-year-olds can't handle ridicule and abuse the same way adults can. This man should never have been left near children. He's much more suited as an eccentric university professor.

**** He most definitely shouldn't have been left near children. I also think Lockhart shouldn't have been allowed near children. Or probably Hagrid. Dumbledore was a legilimens for goodness sake.

I think Dumbledore specifically set up Snape as a "tame" death eater for Harry to cut his teeth on. More so, I believe that because if Dumbledore's plan had worked, and Snape had gained mastery of the elder wand, Harry would have had to kill Snape to get mastery of the wand. Dumbledore counted on Harry hating Snape. And Snape allowing Harry to kill him. There's no indication that anyone knew that a disarming spell could cause a change of the death sticks mastery.

Edit: and the reason for tasking Snape with telling Harry about the final horcrux was a ploy to get Snape near Harry for that murder wand exchange. There was no reason to inform Harry that he had to die by AK at voldemort hand. It was going to happen. Harry was an unqualified teenage wizard against an army of adult terrorists with nearly unlimited financial and political resources. They are going to catch him, take him to Lord V, and that was that.

**** The childish part is simply the hating him, and not recognising that there is more to someone than a single character trait. When Snape said “I see no difference.” He could have meant two things. 1) He sees no difference between what Draco did to Hermione and what Harry did to Goyle. 2) He sees no difference between her teeth now and before. So he said her teeth were big... He made a poor and tasteless comment. It was a single comment, towards a student he no doubt found annoying, arrogant, and somewhat delinquent.

Cruelty to non-human animals is common in Hogwarts. Especially from McGonagall who had her class stick pins into hedgehogs half way though transfiguration into pin cushions, and who only became upset at Moody(Crouch) bouncing a ferret around when she realised it was a student, and who had Hermione vanish kittens as a punishment. Adding the fact that poison (poison does not mean death, only sickness) is hardly a terrible thing to do to the toad considering Neville brings it into potions class anyway, around fire and dangerous potions and all that.

Nevilles boggart is interesting. Why does he fear Snape? Is it irrational? Is it just because he had had an encounter with him earlier in the day? Is it because he knows Snape is a Death Eater and his parents were killed by Death Eaters? In all 7 books Snape gives Neville one detention, and takes 10 points. The only thing he seems to do wrong is loom over Neville when he works, which scares him. (Speaking of Boggart, Remus had the class share their deepest fears with each other, which is in no way problematic)

He might have been an excellent occlumens, proficient in the Dark Arts and a spy. But he was a terrible teacher. And I really can't find any excuses for that. He was an adult in full control of himself and his behaviour. No one forced him to ridicule and frighten children.

Some people have mentioned a need to maintain his cover, but I'm still not sold. Wouldn't it be better if he ingratiated himself with Voldemort's enemies? This way when Voldemort returns and asks him what he has learned Snape can say: "I got close to this person and learned this and that" instead of "I behaved like an asshole and for some reason people didn't trust me with their secrets".

It's blatantly apparent he's saying that Hermione's teeth aren't any different.

He takes one look at Goyle, and tells him to go to the Hospital Wing. But you neglect to mention that the narration notes that Hermione's teeth have grown /past her collar./ They're five or six *inches* long at this point. And the narration also notes that Snape "coldly says 'I see no difference.'"

However much a pain-in-the-neck Hermione can be is immaterial, because she's been /mutilated./ Her teeth are past her /collar./ That's so far from "poor and tasteless," it's not even funny.

No, this was to test the effectivity of the pincushions. She notes that Dean Thomas didn't do a good job because his pincushion curls up whenever someone approaches it with a pin--the implication is that she does not and would not allow a sentient being to be harmed.

And turning animals into inanimate objects is as old as the genre of fantasy itself, so don't bother trying to throw stones at McGonagall for that.

#+begin_quote

Punishment? As I recall, Hermione had gotten to the point where kittens were her coursework--the class started with snails, and then moved on to mice, and Hermione was noted as being advanced enough to start vanishing kittens.

Poison can *too* mean death, especially since we see what can go wrong with Potions. And more to the point, Snape takes delight in knowing that Neville will have to do it to his /pet./

I'll grant that Neville shouldn't have brought Trevor to class, but given how his toad is always running away, Neville likely wants to keep an eye on him.

#+begin_quote

We never see an irrational fear from a boggart. Even Seamus's greatest fear--a banshee--makes sense; he's Irish, and banshees are demon-women from Irish folklore.

While I don't think it's out of the question that a severe encounter in very recent memory might push a fear above an older one--had Harry not encountered a dementor, he'd likely fear a powerful Voldemort most--I don't think that's the case here.

#+begin_quote
  Is it because he knows Snape is a Death Eater and his parents were killed by Death Eaters?

While it's possibly an influencer, Neville never volunteers information about this. And his parents weren't killed by Death Eaters, they were tortured into insanity.

And Neville knows who did it--Bellatrix Lestrange--and he /still/ fears Snape more.

Point of order: He teaches them to /confront/ their fears in a controlled environment, and builds them up to give them the confidence they need to do so. He gently instructs and encourages Neville, and gives him the best way to get back at Snape.
