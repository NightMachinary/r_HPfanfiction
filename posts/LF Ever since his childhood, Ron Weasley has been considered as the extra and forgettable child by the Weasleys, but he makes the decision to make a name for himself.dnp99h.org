Basically, Ron is no longer lazy, he's studious, hardworking. He has always been, whether intentionally or unintentionally, considered as the seventh child who's last in the pecking order, but now, he starts making his own life.

It could be from any PoV, whether from Ron's or Harry, who watches his best friend change from the person who he used to be. I'm just sick of seeing how Ron always gets the short end of the stick amongst his siblings, so just want him to shine and snatch his rewards.


** My absolute favorite in that direction is linkao3(18561046), it plays out in an universe where Voldemort died for good during the attack on the Potters, and Ron gets sorted into Slytherin because he wants to be more than just another Weasley son. It involves wonderful friendships and spans all hogwarts years and sometime after that.

  Everyone knows that the seventh son of the seventh son has great magical abilities, that they are destined to become great.But a sixth son of a seventh son? That's nothing special. There's no guarantee of magic or heroics or special gifts. Just a little boy with lanky limbs and earnest eyes and a face splattered in generations of freckles, who grows up knowing that he's nothing but a footnote to the glory of his older siblings.Ron Weasley grows up as a shadow. Every single one of his older siblings is extraordinary, in their own way- Bill, the exceptional linguist and cursebreaker; Charlie, the dragon tamer; Percy, head boy and prefect; the twins, inventors extraordinaire. His entire life, Ron is compared to them by everyone he knows and always falls just a little short, no matter how hard he tries.Is it any surprise that Ron wants more out of life, that when he arrives at Hogwarts, bastion of magical opportunity and the chance to change his fate, that he takes it?

  Ron has the ability to see the future and he has the choice to either let it happen or change it for the better. Not Powerful!Ron. Pairings undecided as of the moment. Latest chapter for fifth year now here! Thanks for reading! Will continue until 7th year.

** My absolute favourite Ron story (and one of my favourite fanfics, period) is Fate, linkffn(13170637). It's very long, and still in-progress, but the author has maintained a steady stream of updates, so I am optimistic. Definitely check it out if you're a fan of Ron, or just well-written stories in general!

I think it was attempted to be recommended in this thread, but the bot screwed up.

** linkffn(Fate by TheTrueSpartan)

It has what your looking for cranked up a level, hos whole family over shadows him and when he does something his mum is angry.

Tbf it does get emotional, especially for people who have gone through family problems.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.
