I was wondering if their was just fanfiction out there that dealt with Tom Riddles time at Hogwarts and how he became Lord Voldemort.

No Adopted by Harry or Dumbledore or any romance for that matter just the tough life Riddle went through.


** I don't know of any canon-compliant fics covering TMR's hogwarts years but the longest AU with the premise is linkao3(Birds Of A Feather by babylonsheep), Romance is a pretty minor point in this one. Covers all seven years

  In 1935, Hermione Granger meets a boy in an orphanage who despises fairy stories, liars, and mediocrity. He offers her a deal of mutual convenience, and soon a tentative friendship forms between them---if Tom would ever lower himself to call anyone a "friend".But whatever they have, it's something special, and if there's anyone who can appreciate Specialness, it's Tom Riddle.1930's-40's Childhood Friends AU.

** There was one - I don't remember the name - that covered Tom Riddle's years at school in similar fashion to the HP novels. However the author was only on the third book by then. It involved a lot of OCs and Tom Riddle, while being magically able, was nothing like the tyrant typical stories portray him as. In fact he was an outcast trying to find a place for himself in the Slytherin house.

  !COMPLETE! The story of Lord Voldemort's life, from the moment he becomes a wizard to the moment he dies. Everything---Slug Club, Horcruxes, Chamber of Secrets, Death Eaters, working at Borgin's, both wars, banishment, resurrection. With details of what happened in Albania. Names and dates are all canon. Gets significantly darker as the story progresses.
