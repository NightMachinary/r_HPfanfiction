After the GoF ritual, Voldemort gains Harry's blood protection, keeping the Dark Lord safe from... the Dark Lord and his agents.

As long as Harry spends part of the summer with the Dursleys, Voldemort can't take self-harming actions and he cant be betrayed by his Death Eaters.


** BTW, doesn't this make the Blood Wards on 4 Privet Drive going away?
