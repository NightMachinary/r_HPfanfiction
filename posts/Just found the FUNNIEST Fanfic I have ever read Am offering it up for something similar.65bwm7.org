I just found this hilarious fanfic that's got a really similar style to The Thief of Hogwarts and The Champion's Champion, which happen to be two of my favourite humor fics. I think it's supposed to be a Harry/Hermione fic from what I've read so far, or an eventual one maybe. There's a bit of Tonks Romance going on too. I cannot recommend it enough.

What are your favourite humor HP fanfics?


** These are all pretty much crackfics but they make me laugh.

Could've sworn I had more favorited but I can't seem to find them.

Edit: after skimming the story you linked you'd probably like the Harry the Hufflepuff series linkffn(6466185)

  "Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?" ...Snape kicks Harry out of 'Remedial Potions', but as we know from The Philosopher's Stone, there is another Occlumens in the school good enough to keep out the Dark Lord. Stupid oneshot.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind.

  A silly little Marriage Law ficlet. I'm pretty sure every H/S author is required to write one at some point. It's like a rite of passage.- Someone comes to Hogwarts with PLANS, but there are curious surprises at every turn.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  AU Harry is more money-conscious when he arrives at Gringotts with Hagrid. He's not going to let the wonder of magic take away his common sense and if he can get a good deal, he's going to take it. Point of deviation: Harry's primary school taught Home Economics.

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret. In the meantime, Chief-wizard Malfoy has his eyes set on Hogwarts, and only Sir Albus stands in his way.
