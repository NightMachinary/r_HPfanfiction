:END:
I read this years ago on Fanfiction.net and haven't found it in a while. I think it is post GoF. Years after Harry and the gang graduate, Harry is in jail for murder. I think Hermione is his lawyer. Harry is visited/has hallucinations of a goddess. Something about a waterfall in one of the hallucinations. During the trial, it is revealed he has telekinesis or something like that.

The big twist is he has a wife (maybe muggle) who he has been hiding. That fact could have exonerated him but he was hiding her. No one knew about her.

Any help would be grateful!
