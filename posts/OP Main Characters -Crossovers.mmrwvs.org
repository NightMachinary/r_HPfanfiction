I am looking for crossovers with the Main character who can change the entire battle by their very presence. It does not have to be magical power only but can be their strategy, innovative ideas also. I dont like slash much but for this I am willing to take what I can.

for example, in both the cases the battle revolves around a powerful character

Thank you

  When Roy Mustang went to retrieve his eyesight from Truth, he wasn't expecting to end up doing a job in exchange. It couldn't even be an easy job, of course, because Edward's assessment of Truth was a pretty accurate one.

  Many years have passed since the great battle of Hogwarts, and Harry's life has only gotten worse. Of course, he had imagined that after the battle ended, everything would go back to normal; at least, as normal as possible. But it wasn't long until the Ministry was taken over by yet more evil, dark, corrupt wizards. Wizards who wanted Harry out of the picture. After a series of unfortunate events, Harry is left on the run. Running from both the ministry and himself, it seemed. He has nowhere to go, and year after year passes by. He doesn't want to live like this anymore. He wants something better for himself; he wants the life that he once had. Being compared to Voldemort takes it's toll though, and the wizarding world no longer looks upon the boy who lived with wonder. They look upon him with disgust, with suspicious eyes and wands at the ready. He is an outcast in the only place he could call home. Stories about him are riddled with evil and lies, being passed down from generation to generation. But it all changes when a storm above London, England, at 9:46 am on August 13th, brings an outsider to earth, a powerful sorcerer with shoulder length black hair and and charming yet somehow malicious smile.

  Thanos has come close to death more than once. He saw a being who fascinated him. Death is a man of great beauty with the most captivating green eyes. Thanos will try everything to see him again and especially to seduce him. He therefore thinks that destroying worlds will bring him the favors of the Master of Death. Harry is the intermediary between the world of the dead and Hellfeim where a goddess helps maintain peace and balance. The more Thanos kills, the more angry Harry gets. His limit is reached when he attacks the planet under his protection, the Earth. Thanos is going to drool. He doesn't know what will fall on him. Harry Potter is more than a God.All rights go to the amazing author - memepotter952504.

  Centuries after that fatal day of the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter has fallen into legend, a bedtime story parents tell their children, a name whispered around campfires. He wanders the world alone and immortal, until one single reckless moment sends him hurtling into a parallel dimension of heroes and villains. A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles...

** In linkao3(4635096) Main Character is OP compared to others in HP Universe, but his people have non-interfence in human affairs clause, so it takes some time before any battles happen.
