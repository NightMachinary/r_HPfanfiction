When I've been staring into space, I imagine a multi-cross with Jade Potter (FemHarry Potter) being transported in either several games or just one game, with the other champions choosing their own game. This would take place in the 4th year. Jade, for the first task, would be transported to either of these games:

Subnautica (Modded?). Would have the struggle of being truly alone.

Dark Souls 3, maybe either 1 or 2, with dlc? (Modded?). Should be obvious.

Finally, to end it off with either Destiny 1 or 2.

Thoughts?
