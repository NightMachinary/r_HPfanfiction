Discworld kept me company throughout some lonely times during my adolescence years. With Terry Pratchett's passing, I feel compelled to recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3673824/1/End-Of-the-Line][End of the Line]].

It's short, poignant, and well written. Give it a read - enjoyable for both those familiar with Discworld and those not.

RIP Terry Pratchett - your wit, humor, and outlook on life will be dearly missed.


** That made me cry for the first time in years.

** it only takes like 200 words for this story to establish a setting, drag you in, and then crush your heart
