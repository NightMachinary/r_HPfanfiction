Ok so I'll start this of with two things. 1: english is not my first language so I apologize for any grammar or running sentences. 2: I've never used reddit before so I hope I'm doing this right.

Alright I'll just get straight to the point, some years back I read a HP fanfic where these specific thing's where featured.

1: Harry becomes lord Potter and Nevvile becomes lord Longbottom 2: Ginny is disowned by Molly, the twins disown themselves from her and then they later get blood? Adopted by Sirius (They literally become Blacks, they have the Black bloodline in them now) 3: I think it had Drarry in it but I honestly can't remember, but knowing my younger self, I'm pretty sure it did.

I'm almost certain it's on ArchiveOfOurOwn but I haven't had any luck in finding it, if anyone here has recently read or found this fanfic I'd really appreciate being sent a link.

I remember really liking that fanfic abd some of it's dialog really stuck with me, like the part where Molly disowns Ginny by "washing her hands clean of her"

I'm super greatful for any help you guys can give me in searching for this fic, thank you so much for taking the time to read this! I hope you have a great day/night!


** Might be Faith by Dragongirl16, though that's on ff.net. It seems very similar. I didn't get past chapter 3, although I've seen it reccced and described tons of times so I'm pretty sure that's it.

*** Sorry for taking so long to notice this and reply!

But by the look of the first chapter it is! I think someone may have posted it on Aooo without Dragongirls16 permission and it was taken down because I remember being able to just read threw it without having to click for the next chapter.

Thank you so much for the assist!
