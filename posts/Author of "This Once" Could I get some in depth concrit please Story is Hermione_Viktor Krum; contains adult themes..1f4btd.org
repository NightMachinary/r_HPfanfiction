Teaser I'm currently using: "Could he make her whole again? Maybe just this once. Good things always come at a price, but neither Viktor or Hermione expected their twice found love to be so hard won."

I have a few days off of work, so I'm taking some time out to write and edit. I need some frank and in depth constructive criticism for this story, if anyone would be nice enough to help me out. Since this is a mutli-year project for me, and I've re-written parts that I felt didn't fit my voice over the years, as well as an obscene amount of editing. However, I'm working without a beta since this pairing is such a niche genre, and I'd love to get some second opinions.


** I'm interested! Shoot me a PM.
