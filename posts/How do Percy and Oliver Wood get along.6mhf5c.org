They're in the same year and presumably share a dormitory. I wonder if they like each other, or dislike each other, or if they have a kind of grudging respect. My headcanon is the latter. I don't think they understand each other at a basic level, but they look at each other and think, "Well, he's good for Gryffindor, so he must be OK."

I wonder if they ever clashed because they both liked the same girl? Probably not; I can't imagine Penelope is Oliver's type, and Wood's first and only love is the game of Quidditch. Though I can imagine older versions of Romilda Vane throwing themselves at the Gryffindor captain. I doubt the same is true of Percy, even as Head Boy.


** Everything we know about Wood can be summed up in one word: Quidditch. So, he's probably disappointed that Percy either doesn't play, or isn't very good (especially when you consider Charlie and the twins, who were all either pretty good or damn good at their position).

I have no idea what Percy thinks of Wood.

** I love how this fic right here portrays their relationship with each other linkffn(3784000) in that they have a system worked out around each other's personalities and it works.

  Percy Weasley recieves some fictional inspiration before realizing that Authority, though Authority, is not always right. Through DH, he tries to do the right thing, rescue Muggleborns without losing his life or his job, and find the right laws. Complete.

** I've read a story once where Percy was actually the seeker they were planning on using before Harry got the position because their previous one just graduated and Percy sucked the least of all people. I know it's not canon, but I like to think that it is a possibility, and as a possibility it would indicate that Percy and Oliver got along fairly well.

That said, many people take the fact that Percy likes rules way too far. Certainly, he prefers order to chaos, but that's most likely because he'd had to deal with the twins' annoying antics as one of their prime targets (the other being Ron) and not because he has a stick up his arse.

*** Percy becomes seeker in linkffn(Harry potter without Harry Potter)! I really like the Percy/Oliver friendship in that fic. And Percy as seeker is hilarious.

  Suppose Tom Riddle never bothers to show mercy, and Harry Potter dies with his parents? What would that mean for the world, to have no Boy-Who-Lived to save them? ("A couple of stubborn kids" just doesn't have the same ring to it.)

** I'd probably expect Oliver to be rather annoyed by Percy. I think they'd clash due to quidditch, with Percy's strict adherence to rules leading to times when Gryffindor players might miss practice due to detention or the like that Percy got them into. And I'd imagine Percy would look down on someone who would put playing a silly game above academia.
