Normally either Harry or Hermione tend to be the main character, but looking for stories where someone else outside of them are the main character.

Can be on any site/can be any length/can be old or new/would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine.

Am fine with het/slash/femslash/threesomes but doesn't have to focus on pairings.

No Weasley bashings where they use Harry for his fame and fortune cliche.


** Here's one. Self shill on one of my old ones. Luke Skywalkers son and Luna Lovegood.\\
Linkffn(The Boy Who Fell). Neither Harry nor Hermione are main characters. Complete SW/HP crossovers.

  The Boy Who Lived didn't. Now 13 years after Harry Potter was murdered by the Dursleys, magical England is on the verge of collapse. So Luna Lovegood wishes for someone to come and make it all better.

** I would look through the marauder's era tag on ao3 and then exclude any relationships with Harry and Hermione. That or just start a regular search in the fandom and exclude the relationships with them too. I'm afraid if you exclude that characters altogether there wouldn't be any results because they would probably be a side character (which it sounds like you're okay with).

That being said, my favorites are:

Linkao3(Unfogging the future) Linkao3(blood will tell but it often tells too much) Linkao3(rather start a family than finish one) Linkao3(civil disobedience) Linkao3(mallowsweet) Linkao3(I Know Not, and I Cannot Know; Yet I Live and I Love) Linkao3(What's Her Name in Hufflepuff) Linkao3(the train station) Linkao3(these little powerless bones) Linkao3(True Form)

Also I have a maurauder's era self insert without them if you're interested. Linkao3(The Mudblood of Slytherin)

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18633070/chapters/44185117][Howl]] - Molly sends Hermione a howler with massive repercussions. McGonagall, Amelia, Narcissa and a bit of Molly are the POV characters.

  The Maruaders were not nice people, but what if the gang was as Dark as they should at first glance appear to be? AU Marauders era one-shot.

  If pressed, later, she'd say it was exhaustion that caused her to forget who she was talking to, and it was that same exhaustion which prevented her from foreseeing the inevitable fall-out of telling James Potter, "Ugh, no thanks, I hate flying." / Lily/James, seventh year.

  COMPLETE. Ron Weasley makes up his schoolwork, and actually thinks for a change. Snape gets some Christmas presents he doesn't expect. The old game is over, but a new one is just beginning. Please read and review. And thanks to you all!
