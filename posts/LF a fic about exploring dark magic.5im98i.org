Bonus if it goes in depth into its mechanics.

Edit: Should've clarified, I would prefer not abandoned stories as reading through Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived to find it abandoned hurt.

** [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=14378][Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived]]. This fic is unanimously hailed as one of the best fics of the fandom. It doesn't really focus on the mechanics, but it's a solid story about Harry at Drumstrang learning 'questionable' magic. The only downside is that it's abandoned during his 4th year :(

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin]] - Magic (and the world of Harry Potter) is expanded greatly and the author goes in-depth on the theory behind certain spells, expands to include new kinds of spells ('esoteric' and 'wild magic', as well as cultures that don't even use spells) as well as a mysterious set of spells so unforgivable that only a select few in the entire country even know about them.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

** You might enjoy [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10991501/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Serpent-s-Renaissance][Hermione Granger & the Serpent's Renaissance]].

It's an ongoing story where Salazar Slytherin uses a reincarnation potion to resurrect himself as Hermione Granger; without anyone knowing his true identity, he goes through his 1st year at Hogwarts (and onwards), slowly working behind the scenes to clean up his past-self's reputation and reveal the truth about the Dark Arts.

That said, the above story basically just goes with 'Dark Arts are super-powerful magicks that are misunderstood by the magical community at large', so it might not quite fit what you're after.

--------------

If you want a personal theory, I came up with the idea ages ago that Dark Arts are Dark because, basically, they have a corrupting effect on the caster; the more you use them, the more the magical residue from them corrupts your soul and twists your personality and desires. Hence, making it dangerous to use them anything but sparingly.
