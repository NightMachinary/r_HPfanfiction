Side question: what kind of drunk do you think Harry is? I like the idea of a wasted, happy Harry at the Leaky Cauldron with the old crowd.

*** Yeah I don't think Ron and Harry spending a night getting drunk in their sixth year would have been fun for either of them. Ron would have gone way too hard just to prove to himself that he could, and Harry would have gotten even more paranoid and wildly speculative about what Malfoy was up to.

*** I don't think he'd be a happy drunk either. I don't think weed would be any better for him. In my mind, weed makes Harry paranoid and Ron aggressive. Ginny gets giggly and Hermione looks on with disapproval.

**** One of my brothers gets really... talkative, when drunk. But the funny kind. Suddenly he has an opinion on EVERYTHING. And a solution, too. We call it his 'safe the world'-mode. Somehow I always envisioned that for Ron ðŸ¤”

*** *Spoiler warning for the first few chapters*

I found this fic really unpleasant.

The scene with Narcissa telling that story about her sisters that was /clearly/ about her was sort of.. off. It just felt weird. Like yeah, full room let me stop and indirectly apologize to my sister through this heartfelt story I'm telling a five year old.

And then Harry's just like, "yeah thought about killin myself". Yeah, just said that to a room half filled with strangers and his kid godson. From an intensely private person it just seemed super OOC. And just.. /wrong/. He's not supposed to be open like that. /Nobody is that open./

I also recall having issues with the dialogue in general.

I ended up dropping it about four chapters in. Should I finish it, did it get good(particularly the romance, I've been on an HP/DG binge) or not?

  Post Book 7 AU; A little over six years have passed since the events that ended the second reign of Voldemort. Now, Harry Potter is the one that needs to be rescued. Rising to this challenge is... Draco Malfoy? Apparently I have to say No Slash.

** I think a drunk Harry would lose his inhibitions and would let loose.

He would be crazy and maybe depressed, but if cameras were around, he would be one of the idiot-drunks you could see on Youtube.
