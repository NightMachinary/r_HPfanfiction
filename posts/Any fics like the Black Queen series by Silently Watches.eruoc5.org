Not looking for anything in particular, maybe something similar to Solitary Daughter by applesten. I'd prefer if it wasn't focused on Harry, perhaps someone like Hermione or even an OC if it's written well enough. Thanks!

*** Sorry for not clarifying, your assumption is correct though. Generally looking for some dark themes, perhaps something focused on the dark arts. It isn't really presented much in the books/films or many fics out there. I'm just looking for something creative and original, preferably with a female MC. Thanks!

** All According to Plan by LysandraLeigh, and its sequels, are very similar.

The protagonist flaunts her power more, maybe, and it's a little bit lighter in tone because Bella is kind of manic and doesn't brood like Jen. It either took the whole "old magic" and powers thing from Silently Watches, or they both trace back to some other inspiration. linkffn(13001792)

*** Just a minor note for people who want other works by this author, it's actually two: LeighaGreene/PsychoLeigha and inwardtransience (Lysandra).

  Thirteen-year-old Bella Black intended to go back in time to start a war in service to her patron goddess. Ritual magic goes awry and she finds herself in 1993, faced with a failing House of Black, an insane alter ego, and a Dark Lord on the rise. Chaos ensues. Title drop. (A collaboration by LeighaGreene and inwardtransience)
