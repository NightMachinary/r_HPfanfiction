Basically I recently heard of the concept of a [[https://www.thebusinesslitigators.com/the-defamation-proof-plaintiff-doctrine.html][defamation-proof plaintiff]], in which someone has a reputation so terrible, that nothing that could be said about them could possibly make their reputation worse, and I had to wonder, if this applies to the concept of character bashing(Ron, Dumbledore, Snape being favored targets).

So I had to ask the question:

Is Umbridge so terrible a person that she's impossible to actually bash?


** Here's my take. If you try to make her worse, then you run the risk of making her so over-the-top evil that you lose the human element of why Umbridge is scary.

Voldemort is a crazy murderer, but Umbridge is everyday mundane evil given way too much power. She's 100% the lady who calls the cops on a guy sitting in the park, and she knows she's technically barely doing anything wrong, and she never faces consequences because she's too useful to the government. She "just follows orders" her way through the regime. If you turn her into a maniac, the reasons she should be hated change and she's just fem-Voldemort lite.

So if you make her even worse in unsubtle ways (e.g. making her a serial killer) then you can still run the risk of bashing once the character barely resembles the original.

** I've seen (not read but seen in the summary) a couple of fics where Umbridge is sexually abusing Harry. I suppose that's a form of bashing, I mean she's a total bitch in canon but there's never any evidence she's a child sex abuser so it's ramping up her canon bad traits (is a physical abuser of Harry and others with the blood quill) and making it even more unacceptable.

** I read an AU time travel fic that made her even more despicable. Basically she got the ministry to enact a forced marriage law to bolster the dwindling magical population where everyone over 18 and under some arbitrary cut off age had to get married in X amount of time or be assigned a random spouse through a lottery. Then people had to wear special ministry rings that monitored "copulations", and couples who didn't meet the quota went to Azkaban.

Of course she got to pick her own spouse from the lottery.

It was pretty horrible, but am not sure if it counts as bashing because the way it was written felt in character for her.

** There was a story I just read about the relationship between Harry and Andromeda in the immediate aftermath of the war, and while I don't want to spoil this particular part, there is some confusion about the location of Remus' body after the dust settles.

Let's just say that Umbridge was behind it and it most definitely has to do with him being a werewolf. And it's both revolting as well as completely in character while escalating the evilness of her character in a very believable way.

It's a most excellent canon-abiding story but that particular part is somewhat disturbing so be warned -> [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3717364/1/The-Goblin-the-Snitch-and-the-Werewolf]]

** The only plausible way to escalate her, in my opinion, is to have her be an outright marked Death Eater.

Like, she knows Voldemort is back, and the reason her Student Enforcers are all Slytherins is because she's explicitly performing a recruitment drive on the next generation of Death Eaters.

This is also why she does everything she can to poke and prod at Harry, to undermine him at every turn, and this is also why teams and associations that aren't created with her full knowledge and permission are marked as illegal gatherings.

TLDR she's stamping down all the "mudblood and blood traitor filth" to, in effect, stop a second war from happening before it begins, but in Voldemort's favor. And she nearly succeeds.

** I don't think it is possible to bash Umbridge, mainly because you can't really change her character that much. She is not a "Full Evil" bad guy like Voldemort, but more like a "Everyday Evil".

When you have a "Dark Lord" kind of bad guy, you can go overboard with some of his trait, make him create some incredibly convoluted plots (like the whole Triwizard Tournament in GoF), or have him be a drama queen who just love Drame (once again, see GoF), because this character will still have something that make him seen as a threat even with the theatrics. Voldemort have his magical power and his followers, just like the Emperor of Star Wars have his army, his Death Stars (plural), and his POWEEEEEER, UNLIMITED POWEEEEEER.

But in the case of Umbridge, she is more of a "Every Day Evil". She is scary because she is realistic, and relatable, everyone met a nasty teacher, or a superior who abused her position, or we could in the future.\\
The problem with this character is that Rowling already met pretty much as evil as she could, so if you push her traits any more (let's say by making her sexualy assault children), then she stop being a realist bad guy and just become a parodic vilain. But unlike the "True" vilain, Umbridge has absolutely nothing to show outside of her borrowed authority, outside of the system she is nothing.

I don't think you can make Umbridge worse while keeping her "realistic", and once she stop being realistic, she stops being scary unless you make her very OOC (making her as strong as Voldemort as an example).

** I think there's very little you could do to make her a worse person, without removing the point of the character.

Her entire character is pretty much government-corruption personified - her horrible behaviour technically doesn't break any /rules/, at least not in a way that she can technically get punished for. Her every move is designed such that she can spin it into a worse situation for Harry and Dumbledore government-wise, without them being able to do anything about it.

Even the part where she almost Crucios Harry is done in such a way that she'd get away with it - it's practically her word against that of a bunch of kids already mistrusted by government, and by that point she already has too much power in the school to be gotten rid of by lawful means.

As long as the author keeps that in mind, she's nearly impossible to vilify.

Hilariously, the films introduce some fridge-logic to her character. In the books, she only uses her Black Quill on Harry and on Lee Jordan - which is unlikely to get her in trouble, as Harry's word is already dirt and Lee Jordan's easy enough to spin into "friend of Potter" reputation.\\
In the film, she uses her Black Quill on enough students, most of them random background characters, that there's no way in hell the government would survive her year at Hogwarts regardless of Voldemort being back or not.

She's the kind of woman to deny food stamps to a family of five because technically someone else is higher on the list.

She's the kind of woman to have the Red Cross removed from a scene of disaster because they are on private property.

Harry Crow just sorta stuck with me as the only fanfic in all of my reading history where I stopped halfway because I simply /couldn't continue/. Not because it was horribly written (in fact, I feel like a lot of fics would be better if the author was as good at writing as robst is), nor did it have anything disgusting. It was just so ridiculously bloated and drawn out. Like I think if Harry Crow was a normal length fic, it would be one of the often reccomended independant!Harry fics.

It might not be the worst one I've read soon enough. The prince of slytherin is coming up soon on my reading list, and going off what I've read about it on this subreddit, it's likely to top Harry Crow with ease.

** I think the best way to approach making umbridge worse is not by making her intolerable in-universe (which she already is), but to double-down the slights on the readers themselves. Have her subtly act on meta-knowledge she couldn't possibly have in universe. For instance, say Harry and Hermione share a particularly touching, emotionally charged, and private moment. Have Umbridge come along and tap-dance on that social bond, perhaps by insulting Harry for being friends with that "arrogant mudblood brat" or coincidentally bringing up the same subject Harry and Hermione discussed. Umbridge couldn't have known, and in-universe, her actions were only mildly malicious, but it gets the readers in a frothy rage.
