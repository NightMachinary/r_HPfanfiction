Any fics where Harry (or other MC) learns another kind of magic? Earth magic, creature magic, stuff like that if you know any.

*** Esama is kind of a genius. Thinking about how most fic authors go, they start their super great story, publish tons of chapters in the beginning when they are super inspired, and then slowly run out of gas and publish one chapter a year if you're lucky. Practically all of my favorite fics are trapped in the later part of that cycle, but Esama just straight up abandons stories when s/he doesn't want to write them anymore, and so is always in the high-functioning inspired mode, consistently publishing thousands of words a day. S/he sure loves slash though.

**** Yeah, most of their work is slash, but it doesn't feel forced or contrived. It's just 'XY is a hero doing this and that and blah blah' and them being gay is just another trait, not a major plot point.

  Harry Potter was lost, but now is found. The Arch-Mage isn't happy. Harry isn't happy. And they're just the first two people who are going to find The Boy Who Lived's destiny one immense headache... Completed. It's my "Winnie the Pooh" to my A.A. Milne. (That's NOT a complementary comparison, by the way.)

** Linkffn(8233291) has a lot more ritual type magic and exploration of magics like necromancy but isn't focused on it. The main character doesn't use a wand, not sure if it's what you're looking for though.

**** Ohh, I've never seen that one, looks good. It's not complete though, decision, decisions. Do you think the author will finish it? Yeah, I don't know why but whenever I read the bit with the dollhouse's and warding I get really happy for some reason. I'm pretty sure that it is in this series anyway....

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

  Instead of attending Hogwarts, Harry Potter was taken as an apprentice by a druid who taught him a more archaic form of magic. Now fully trained in the mystic arts of water and wood, he comes out of isolation to rejoin magical society and wage guerrilla warfare against Voldemort through ritual magic and alliances with the fae creatures of ancient Britain.

** The Power of Love series by Philosophize has this, but it takes a bit to get there.

In a nutshell, it's a Fem!Harry/Hermione story starting just before the Yule Ball. Harry (called Jasmine in this fic) and Hermione learn ritual magic/love magic over time by performing pagan rituals in the Forbidden Forest with the visiting Veelas. That's an absurdly simplified summary of this series; it's definitely worth the read, and is one of the very few fics that gets the idea of soul-bonds right.

  Sequel to The Power of Love: Voldemort is back, the Ministry is in denial, and Dumbledore is stalling, but Jasmine isn't alone. She and Hermione are supported by new friends, defended by two shieldmaidens, and empowered by ancient magic. Eliminating Voldemort is the least of the tasks which prophecy expects from them, but how will these witches transform the whole magical world?
