Definitely one of the remaining good fanfic rec sites, with a huge history and bajillions of recs. And you can then go on to the site of the author you like and read even more. Read ALL THE FICS! (And do none of the work...)

There was a lull in the past couple of months, but it's active again now. They're also looking for new reccers for some pairings, so if you're interested, definitely sign up!

And forgive me if it has been mentioned, but I didn't see it in searches.


** This is by far the best. The tags are amazing so many recs!

**** The first rec was a slash pic of draco/snape... Draco was naked laying on a bed. Not really my cup of tea.

***** Hahahah yea definitely not mine either. Glad you tried it though. If you run out of good fics you can always go back and look for your pairings, they have tags for each, as well as lots of gen fic.
