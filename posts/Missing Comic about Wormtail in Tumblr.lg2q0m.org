Hello. Lately, I have been looking for an old comic in Tumblr with Peter Pettigrew as the protagonist. Relating that the Marauders were never a happy group, because they were always trampling over others weaker than themselves, trying to justify his decision to join Voldemort. One thing I remember clearly was the fact that Peter's face was like a rat even in his human form. But now, I can't find it anywhere. Does anybody know what happened to it? And, if you do, can you tell me, please?
