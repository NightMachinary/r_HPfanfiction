According to Inverarity's [[https://inverarity.livejournal.com/339000.html][most recent blog post]], Book 5 of the Alexandra Quick series, which has been a work in progress for almost 7 years, has finally been completed. Or at least, the first draft has. It will still need to be edited but, in Inverarity's words, "I can finally say with reasonable confidence that Alexandra Quick and the World Away will be published in 2019."

So I suppose that answers [[https://cn.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8u7aqn/what_do_you_think_will_finish_first_the_next/][this question]].


** So now, after Inverarity has beaten GRRM, we need new question:

What is going to happen first, will Santi make a comeback and publish new chapter HPatBWL or will TWoW be published?

** I've been in this fandom since the books first came out and I'm still discovering epic works that are well known in many circles (just not in move). Thanks!

*** I definitely used to see this series recommended here occasionally a few years ago, but it doesn't seem to get mentioned much these days. Probably since it's been so long since the last book.

** Time to reread the first four books, it's been years since I read them and I barely remember anything about the plot.

** The TWoW post was mine. Glad to have an answer. I think I may need to reread the series before this comes out though, as I've forgotten a lot of details from the first four books. Or if there is a pretty detailed summary somewhere that would work too.

*** If AQ6 and AQ7 take as long as AQ5, you might be waiting a couple of decades.
