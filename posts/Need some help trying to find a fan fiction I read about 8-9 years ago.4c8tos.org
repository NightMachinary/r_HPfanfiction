So this particular fan fiction was released sometime between HBP and DH. It was basically an alternate Deathly Hallows and continued from where HBP left off.

The details I remember are, it was slightly adult themed.

Harry takes Ginny along with Ron and Hermione to hunt for horcruxes. During this hunt, harry takes ginny out for a date in one particular chapter.\\
IIRC, the author guessed most of the horcruxes and the Harry being a horcrux theory correctly. Also, Harry learns Avada Kedavra from Kingsley while they were taking refuge at an abandoned Hogwarts. Ron and Harry also get drunk sometime during this time in one chapter.

Also, theres a hint of Voldemort coming back in the last line of the last chapter of the book.

EDIT: Looks like I fucked up mixing 2 different fan fictions. I edited the post to remove some elements from the one that I don't need.\\
One more thing I remember about the one that I'm looking for: Dudley was a wizard and the deal Petunia made with DUmbledore was that she would take in Harry only if Dumbledore puts an enchantment on Dudley removing his magical powers. And now that Dumbledore is dead, the enchantment seems to have worn off, and Dudley is mega pissed.\\
The Dursleys enter Hogwarts to take refuge at some point near the end and are only able to see piles of garbage because apparently thats what muggles see when they look at hogwarts.

I'm sorry if it seems like im just talking outta my head, but I'm trying to recollect the story as clearly as I can. Unfortunately I don't remember much else.

I'm hoping someone can point me towards this particular fan fiction.

Thanks in advance


** Looks like this one: linkffn(2818538)

I smiled when I remembered this fic: it was the first fic I read, I found a .pdf file googling for the deathly hallows before it was released.

  Harry has to decide who to trust as he moves closer to fulfilling his destiny. Will he be able to find and destroy all the Horcruxes? And at what price? Will he be able to find the strength within himself? And...can he do it and still get the girl

*** Ha. I thought of this too, because of the "Hermione in a bikini while Harry gets a job" thing. The rest of it doesn't match up though...

*** Thanks for this.\\
But it seems I done fucked up and mixed 2 fan fictions I read. This one was one of them!

One more thing I remember about the one that I'm looking for: Dudley was a wizard and the deal Petunia made with DUmbledore was that she would take in Harry only if Dumbledore puts an enchantment on Dudley removing his magical powers.
