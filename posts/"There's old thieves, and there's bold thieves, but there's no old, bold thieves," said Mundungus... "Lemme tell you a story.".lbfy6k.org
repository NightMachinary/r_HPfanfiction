I don't see a lot of fanfics that really make use of Mundungus more than he appears in canon.

The "thieves" line is from a Mercedes Lackey novel, /Take a Thief/. It might be older than the novel, but it's where I first read the line.


** In my story "Harry Potter and the Lady Thief", Mundungus is a gentleman thief who went down the gutter after losing his family in the first war, and then was recruited as a mentor for Hermione by Dumbledore (and as another attempt to help Mundungus recover).

*** Okay the gentleman thief thing just gave me the idea of a fic where Remus's full name is actually Remus Arsène Lupin, and he pulls off the most amazing thefts. He can disguise himself as anyone, from an unemployed werewolf to a professor at the premier education center in the country. Whether he bases himself off of the Arsène Lupin books or the books don't exist in the story, either works.

(Yes I did watch that French Netflix show called Lupin, it's really good, would 100% recommend)

**** Arsène was his grandfather!

Too bad I already wrote a story with such heists - I might've gone with that instead.

**** See this is why you should read a few chapters of a fic even if the description doesn't really grab your attention! Generally a fan of your works but never got around to reading this one.. and now Mundungus is the reason I'm gonna start this fic.

Never thought I'd say that.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

** I have a Mundungus chapter in my fic, I think he's a great character! He's also very useful plot-wise, being knee-deep in dodgy dealings

** I don't remember the name but there was a pre-DH seventh year fic in which the author correctly anticipated that the locket was the same as the one seen in OotP at the Grimauld Place and it had been stolen by Dung (who didn't anticipate though?). Anyways Dung is caught selling stolen goods and sent to Azkaban so the trio has to break him out. It's a shame JK didn't make use of a similar plot to introduce Azkaban, which is one of the few places in the series that is talked a lot about but never introduced. Anyways later on Dung remains Harry's informant from the underworld and plays a pretty significant role.
