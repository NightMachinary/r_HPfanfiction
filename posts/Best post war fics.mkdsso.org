I want one that's canon and feels closest to the books in tone and prose style/quality

A lot of the fanfic I've read is super sappy and over the top when it comes to the romance, this is an instant turn off for me.

It's also important to me that it picks up the day after the war or at least covers it briefly


** Everything by Northumbrian. You have the chronological list on FanFiction.Net on his profile. And you also have some snipppets of stories that might have happened during the books and are canon compliant ;) my major head cannons on the post war are his. If you want directly after the war, you can start with Tales of the Battle or Grave Days.
