So I read this fic years ago and I've looked for it multiple times since then to no avail.

It's a 2 part story focused around Hermione, Fred and George. In the first part Hermione is sent back in time to mid-OOTP by touching a book in the magic shop, and while in the past falls in love with Fred. He still dies and in part 2 she starts having a relationship with and eventually marries George. It's all very gradual with her taking time to grieve between relationships and definitely no incest between the boys. She also gets pregnant at some point but I can't remember who the father is.

Any gestures in the right direction would be greatly appreciated :D


** Sounds like something Bedelia wrote but no longer has up on her page.

** Sounds like I fear no fate by Bedelia. Maybe someone on here has a copy?
