** He was handsome in canon so no, don't really have a problem with it.

(He is said to look very much like James who was handsome. Incidentally he is also described as of a height with James, who is described as "tall").

** It doesn't bother me and it plays into the perception we all probably hold that the hero is very good looking, which is quite common across all forms of fiction.

If you're doing an AU where Harry meets a very attractive character for the first time and they get together quickly and/or the story deals with a lot of will they/won't they conflict, it makes sense for Harry to be attractive himself. Not required, but logical.

** I'd say cliche, personally. I don't honestly see the point of 'enhancing' how he looks. The only thing that might be different appearance-wise as a result of Harry being raised by others is that he might be a little less malnourished and thus a bit bigger.
