#+TITLE: Are there any fics focusing on an adult whose skill is like Harry crouch junior or Tom riddle or dumbledore but not being murderous crazy people? Reading about kids being able to do all these things that adults just can’t does get old for me.

The idea that Harry and friends can fight death eaters in a 1v2 odds fight and come out with like no injuries really irritates me because these are the people everyone is terrified of.

Well, JKR is really fond of the "lucky hero" trope.

Grindelwald in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929), qualifies to a certain degree, although it's debatable whether he is "being murderous crazy" or not. But as the title says, he is "really trying" not to be one.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...

It was less 'fighting' more 'running away like hell was after them, with occasional attacks back' and even then, there's a couple of points

1. The DEs were after the prophecy orb, as long as they didn't know who had it they had to be careful about which spells they used to try to avoid breaking it so that took some of their arsenal away, mainly AoE or break everything in their path type ones
2. They might also have wanted to try living hostages at one point, I know the film had that occur just before the Order showed, don't recall in the book
3. Even when the Ministry Six as some call them did knock a DE down, it rarely did anything worth while as others would get them back up PDQ
4. Up to the point of the Order showing up, there were at least 3-4 moderate to major injuries sustained by the kids - broken node for Nevil, Ron being mauled by the cognivores (brains), broken ankle for Luna or Ginny and slashed open shoulder to hip for Hermione that I recall
5. It probably took the DEs a minute to sort themselves out after having several shelves of prophecies dropped on them by the kids, the shock from the spell used to bring them down and the effect of any protections on the orbs

That's not saying that the group weren't damned lucky, but there were other factors at play, including potentially over confidence on the DEs part, since they likely weren't expecting teens to lob spells around that likely were higher level, especially if their own kids downplayed the sextet's abilities initially.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief) in the second half they're all adults, Ron and Harry graduated from Hogwarts and immediately joined the aurors, Hermione works for Sirius as secretary and helps with his political campaign against Malfoy. At least that's what everyone thinks they do. At night they occasionally break into a manor, rob the purebloods blind and barely escape from their boyfriend/godson.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
