I've read heaps of stories where Molly, Ginny, Ron and Albus are after Harry's fortune and plot to steal it away by having Ginny marry him and then die or whatevs. Plot twist. Harry's gay! Weaslus won't let that stop them. Ginny might not be Harry's type - but surely....Ron is!

I'm curious to see how this would go. Ron could be written so many ways - is he lazy unmotivated Ron and has to be persuaded by the others? Do they have to potion him too? Is he a motivated Ron willing to do anything for the cause? Was it his own idea? Does Dumbledore give him advice to woo Harry? Actually I'd also be curious to read one where Ron's always had the dream of marrying the BWL.

Thoughts?


** /I don't write fanfiction at all but I thought I'd give it a go with a little piece. Again, I wrote a short one, but this idea could go really far! Here goes.../

The sound of voices could be heard from Ron Weasley's tiny attic bedroom early one morning. With an exasperated moan, Ron sat up in his twin bed and strained his ears to hear what all the noise was. He could hear his father, Arthur's own exasperated tones, but he couldn't make out what exactly he was saying. The front door made a bang as it slammed so hard Ron could have sworn he felt his room tilt unevenly, and scurrying to his window, he watched his father storm out of the house and disapparate.

Ron glanced at his best friend since he started Hogwarts seven years ago lying on the makeshift bed on the floor of his room to see if the noise had woken him up. Harry was still asleep, oblivious to the happenings of the Weasley household. All his time spent sleeping in a cupboard under the stairs had made him a very deep sleeper. Ron knew from experience with the noisy ghoul above him that Harry could sleep through just about anything.

The red headed boy could hear the faint sound of his mother's voice, but judging by the still-dark sky outside, it had to be very early in the morning. What was she going on about? He stepped around Harry and opened his bedroom door, quietly walking down the many stairs of the Burrow to listen in on his mother's words.

“There's no time, Ginny!” Mrs Weasley was saying, her tone, usually soft and motherly, was sharp, meaner than it got even with the twins. “Do you understand what I'm saying?”

“What's all this about?” Ron had entered the kitchen now, surveying the scene in front of him. His little sister, Ginny, was seated at the table, her face flushed a deep scarlet, but her expression unreadable. His mother, Molly, was standing above her, her own cheeks flushed. At the sound of Ron's voice, she looked up, startled, and twisted her lips into a smile that didn't quite reach her eyes.

“Ron, dear, why are you up so early? And on Christmas holidays!” An uneasy laugh slipped out and she stepped back from Ginny, who was looking out the kitchen window, avoiding Ron's gaze.

“I heard Dad leave,” he answered simply, staring curiously at her. “What did you mean there's no time, Mum? No time for what?”

Quickly, almost too quickly, Molly replied with, “I'm trying to convince your sister to ask Harry out.” Ron continued to stare, almost accusingly now, at his mother. She giggled uncomfortably. “I love him like my own son! Just trying to push her in the right direction... You're both leaving back to Auror training in a few weeks and...”

“We're still best mates. We'll be back for Easter,” Ron pointed out with an eye roll, “but there's no point even trying to date him, Ginny.”

For the first time since he entered the kitchen, his sister looked at him, and for a moment he thought he saw relief wash over her features, but it had disappeared almost as quickly as it had come.

“What?” Molly asked, frowning, “why not?”

Ron knew that Harry was gay, but he wasn't about to out his best mate to his family without Harry's okay. So instead of saying that, he grinned cheekily at his mother and took his own seat at the table, replying, “Ginny's not his type.”

Before his mother could respond, however, Harry himself stepped into the kitchen, his hair, if possible, even messier than usual. When he stopped walking, he stretched, his t-shirt pulling up slightly. Harry caught Ron staring and grinned sleepily, green eyes flashing in a cheeky sort of way.

Ginny seemed to catch this but she didn't comment, instead she glanced up at her mother cautiously. At the look on her mother's face, her tiny smirk dropped and twisted into a frown. Molly had caught the interaction, her look of dissatisfaction twisting into a very satisfied smirk of her own.

“Good morning, dear!” Molly chirped, “I'm just about to make breakfast, can you run up and wake George up for me?”

Ever so helpful, Harry smiled back at Mrs Weasley and replied with a quick, “Okay.” He disappeared from the kitchen as quickly as he'd entered, leaving the three Weasleys alone once again.

“Ronald,” Molly said after waiting a moment. Ron glanced at her cautiously. She rarely ever used his full name. She didn't look mad, however. In fact, she looked simply ecstatic. “You and Harry?”

/Blimey/, Ron thought, /had she seen that?/ Her question had proved that, yes, she had. Regardless, he decided to play dumb, blinking up at her. “Harry and me what?”

“Oh, don't act stupid, Ronald,” she swatted his shoulder gently, “I wasn't born yesterday, you know! Are you two...” her eyes twinkled, “involved?”

“What?” The boy gasped, feeling his face heat up. “Harry and me? Involved? Bloody hell, Mum! No!”

Her expression dimmed slightly. “But you like him, don't you?”

“I mean... I...” As if his flushed cheeks and shameless staring hadn't already given him away. He nodded, embarrassed, no longer able to catch his mother's eye. She clapped excitedly and rushed to him, positively thrilled.

“Well, why don't you ask him out?” She beamed. He glanced up again, his cheeks still warm. What was she on about? First Ginny, now him? Clearly no one in the family had to date Harry for him to be apart of the family himself, so why was she so adamant? “You did say Ginny wasn't his type, did you not? Would you say that /you/ are?”

He flushed again, closing his eyes. He severely wished his mother would give him a break. This was not at all what he expected when he woke up this morning. He gave a noncommittal shrug, still not wanting to out his friend. If Harry wanted everyone to know about his sexuality, he would have told everyone himself. Ron wasn't going to say anything for him.

Molly pestered him for answers for minutes and minutes while Harry was off waking George up. He knew it would be quite the task. Since losing Fred, George was rarely ever home, and when their mother had forced him home for the holidays, he'd spent most of the time in his and Fred's old room, sleeping and shutting himself away.

After countless minutes of constant pestering, Mrs Weasley seemed to lose her patience, and she snapped at Ron with a quiet, but very sharp, whisper. “You /will/ do something, Ronald Weasley,” came her snap, “do you understand me?”

He leaned away from her, shocked, but she continued, narrowing her eyes. “You know the fortune he has in his vault at Gringotts, the fortune he has in Black's vault! Look around you! Look at what we could do, how we could live, with that money! You will do whatever you need to to get it, do you hear me?”

“You're mad!” Ron shot back, “you're absolutely barking! Steal his money? Are you joking?”

Mrs Weasley laughed a very dry laugh. “What does one boy need with all of it? We can't live off of Arthur's salary forever, and I'm not going to wait for another winning from the Ministry. Think of all we could have with it. You want that, don't you, Ron? Don't you, dear?”

But before he could reply, Harry had walked back in, more awake, with a tired George following closely behind. Unaware of what had happened in his absence, Harry grinned at Ron and sat down next to him while Mrs Weasley kissed George's cheek fondly and turned swiftly away to start breakfast, but not before shooting Ron another pointed look.

Speechless, Ron looked at his mother's back and then at Harry, who was now engaged in polite conversation with Ginny.

He'd been in love with Harry since his first year at Hogwarts, seven years ago. He knew that he'd wanted to be with him - really be with him - since then. But use him? For what, money? Ron was well versed in a life with little money, but was money really worth losing everything he had with Harry?

Staring at his best friend, with his untameable black hair, his bright green eyes, his wide smile, he knew the answer immediately.

No, it wasn't.

So what the bloody hell was Ron going to do now?

**** Thank you!! I'm super biased - I love Ron too much to twist his character, and I thought it would be super interesting to see Molly as the villain considering how motherly and familial she is in the books :)

** I kind of have to reach a bit, but if you don't mind one with lots of changes, Red Hair and Grass Blades linkao3(17848004) has Fem!Harry secretly engaged to Ron by Manipulative!Dumbledore to loot the Potter family wealth. This is also a BWL!Neville, so Harriett does not have the fame, and as of the latest chapter I'm not even sure if Ron is aware of the engagement. Molly certainly is, and is not presented in a positive light.
