#+begin_quote
  Suppose Tom Riddle never bothers to show mercy, and Harry Potter dies with his parents? What would that mean for the world, to have no Boy-Who-Lived to save them? ("A couple of stubborn kids" just doesn't have the same ring to it.)

*** Oof. Thanks for the rec but from the first chapter it already has things I dislike: OP Harry, H/Hr, Dumbles bashing. I'm actually looking for a fic which focuses on the remaining cast because Harry is minimally involved due to being dead or gone.

**** Do yourself a favor and don't read any Robst fics then. All his fics have OP Harry, H/Hr, and (usually) Dumbles bashing.
