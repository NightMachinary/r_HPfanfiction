What is that fic where Voldemort possesses Harry in fifth/sixth year and accidentally falls in love with Hermione before Harry regains control.

EDIT: Pairing was HarryXLuna and Luna would do diary entries where she slowly admitted to it that she was slowly falling in love with Harry.

  Harry is struck with the killing curse and wakes up the day of the Last Task. This story will be the Order of The Phoenix if Harry had been a bit wiser and Luna a more present character. No time Paradox and no godmoding. Slow build up. Also, the tanslation in French is available by Eohwel.
