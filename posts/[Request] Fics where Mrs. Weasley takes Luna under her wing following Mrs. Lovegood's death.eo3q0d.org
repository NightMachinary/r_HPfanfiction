Any length is fine, though I would prefer fics that have this as a focus or at least a subplot


** Why would she take luna under her wing when Mr. Lovegood can provide a safe home for her daughter?

*** I can see Mrs. Weasley being the type to believe a girl needs a female mentor/role model in her life. Xenophilius is also kinda crazy, which could've been worse after his wife's death, and Mrs. Weasley might want to be a stable influence on their family the same way she's kinda a surrogate mother for Harry in canon. He also has a pretty active career so I can see her as a babysitter or homeschooling her along with Ginny.
