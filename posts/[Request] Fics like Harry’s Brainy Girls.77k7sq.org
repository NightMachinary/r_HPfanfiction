Pretty much what you asked for. The writing quality is not as good as HBG, however, and there are a lot of female characters from other fandoms.

  Various one shots Harry's various naughty adventures(or misadventures, depending on your angle), with women. Not for children.

  Harry is paired up with every girl in the Potter universe. All girls chosen are what I deem smart or brainy. That means no Ginny or Molly chaps in this. There are many more girls in this then what I've listed above, it's too many to put on there. This series will have chaps that range from G to NC-17 really. All chaps that are NC-17 will have a warning before the chap begins also along with any other warning if any.
