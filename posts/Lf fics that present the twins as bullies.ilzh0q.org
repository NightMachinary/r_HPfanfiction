** It's first person and Harry is a bit of a "dancing on a pinhead on the edge of forever" beat-poet type, but Ingenio Ab Artifex has the Twins Pranks being cast in that sort of light. They're also Lie I've Lived level antagonists.

I can't link, due to technical violation of rule 8 (It's not graphic at all - literally at the level of "And we went upstairs and had a grand old thirty minutes of fun" - and as is so rare in Romeo-Juliet Pairings, the older person didn't know their partner was underage and they actually talk negatively about the age difference throughout the story) so just google 'Ingenio Ab Artifex (Formerly Flowers For Your Grave) by Jaime Jabs' on FFnet.

Also has one of the few powerful Harry characters who actually is friendly with Dumbledore.

*** You got me all messed up with that description of Harry and I still can't decide whether that was a criticism or praise.

**** Heh. A bit of both, in all honesty. Harry as a member of the Beat Generation makes for a fun character, but that kind of overly-americanised subculture can grate at some people in a fandom so intermittently obsessed with 'Britishisms'.

I give the same warning whenever I recommend Wastelands of Time - the phrase actually started out there because I couldn't remember the word 'Kerouacian' and the edge of forever thing was the closest I could get. :D

Love your work, btw. Ingenio Ab Artifex is one of those stories I go back to when I need something I know I'll enjoy. :)

***** In all honesty, I try to steer clear of american sub-culture in the fic precisesly for that same reason but as a foreigner to both U.S and U.K, I am exposed to media from U.S ten times the latter, so it bleeds through. And thank you for reading it! I love to hear from people who do. Any critisms you want to throw in my way, I'm eager to listen.

****** We're the same in the UK nowadays, unfortunately. Perks of the 'special relationship'. We're already renaming our secondary schools as high schools like Americans. If they survive their current political difficulties, we'll definitely all be buying their blue jeans and listening to their pop music in another couple of decades.

Honestly, other than the fact Harry sounds like he was raised by a man who waxes lyrical (in a pleasant drawl) about the experience of riding a classic American-made motorcycle along a lonely oceanside road, wind blowing through his hair and the sun shining on his skin and his leather jacket pinching in all the same places as the girl he took to his motel last night and left still sleeping there this morning did rather than a British Guy, there's not really any critiques or criticisms I can give you.

Your technical writing was good, your Dumbledore is magnificent (seriously, one of my absolute favourites - a little tired, a little old, a little manipulative, a little clever, a little funny, and really adores Harry), and I really enjoyed both your tournament story and the development of Harry and Fleur's relationship (even the whole underage thing was handled well - though you did lean a little too far into the 'I'm confused, but your snogging is just too good' end of things every now and again, it worked for the chaotic and confused feelings Fleur was showing).

I'm also not old enough to have been alive when Harry was (I was born in '96), so despite being English, I can't comment on what cultural references might've actually been appropriate for Harry to make instead of the Beat Poet thing.

I suppose I might've liked to have seen more development or detail in the secondary cast - Balzac and Hermione and Ron and so on - but I'm not sure what precisely I'd've liked to see beyond more detail on their lives or personalities. I just remember a few times where I finishing reading and thought "I'd really like to've seen more from people who weren't Fleur, Harry, Dumbledore, or Bill."

******* Well, that'a the downside of globalization. You see it here, in Turkey as well. Two-third of all shop signs is in English or some not-so-smart tongue-in-cheek version of it. It is frustrating because only a small percentage of the country can speak or even understand it. At the cost of globalization, we let go of all the things that made Turkey a beautiful place. It is truly sad.

And on the secondary cast, I plan to, when I finally get around to writing it, include more of Balzac and the main gang in the story. I plan on three parts, and the first one was about the romance between Fleur and Harry, as it will factor heavily in Harry's growth, and Voldemort's return and his... difference from the canon.

Second part will be of Hwrry finding his footing within the war, his place and who he truly is when stripped from his armour and glamour. Is he an artist at heart, forced to play a hero? A kind and open-hearted boy, who uses his sharp tongue as a defence? A wizard of immense power, hampered by his unstable mental health? Or is he an ordinary kid, albeit gifted one? In this second part, I will rely heavily on his friends as a way to both keep him grounded within the sphere of Hogwarts and his age group, and as a contrast to weigh where he stands in terms of... well everything.

The third part will be the hardest to write, I think, because it will involve much more retrospection and will force Harry to take of the rose-tinted glasses he wears when looking at people he loves and cherises. It will also circle back to his current fears of how much he could fall and suffer before he becomes what he fights. And whether he needs to fall at all.

Honestly, I have many story lines circling through my mind that, it feels inpossible to fit them all in to this one story, so I'll probably keep them on the back burner for another story, but if and when I get to finish the story as a whole, I plan on having it be more of an ensemble-cast sort of thing than the self-centered story it has been so far.

******** Indeed it is. Though I admit I wouldn't be opposed to more integration from other sources - actual true 'globalisation' from the entire globe, rather than just America. Variety is the spice of life and all that. Some giant mishmash of everything would be interesting. Becoming Little America is terrifying.

Jesus, Money, Guns, and Sports are a flawed mix.

Those story ideas all sound great! I hope you get around to writing those someday (though no pressure - I more than understand the 'too much to write, too little time and headspace to write it' sentiment).

Does sound like you'll need to take a lot of notes on characterisation and development throughout the second part to provide a foundation for the third, though. :)

And too many ideas is also a sentiment I very much understand. Even just whole 'story ideas' rather than integrated storylines. I have a list of stories I'd like to write and at the time I'm writing this, it's 153 things long. :D

********* Well, that's a long career ahead of you. I hope you get around to writing most, if not all of them. It truly is a pleasure to get what's in your head ob a paper, or a computer as the case may be.

********** It really is a pleasure, though I know for a fact I'll never finish them all. It's been five years and I've only finished two fics, and life has only gotten busier.

I hope you finish yours as well. Thanks for the chat, apologies for the politics, and I look forward to seeing what you write in the future. :)

** i doubt you're going to find many fics depicting the twins in a negative light without also doing so to the rest of the weasleys, dude.

​

can't recall the actual title or author, but the only one that really comes to mind basically depicts the entire weasley family as complete pieces of shit, who happened to hide their true nature from Harry. with the real reason why Bill and Charlie took jobs outside of country being to escape the relatives of their victims that were after their heads.

other than that, the only one that just popped into my head would be Alexander Harris and the Shadow Council by Tenhawk, assuming you can find a copy of it, which has them somewhat acting like bullies towards Xander. it's a Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Addams Family, and Harry Potter crossover. the basic premise being that Xander and Wednesday Addams attend hogwarts and are best friends with Hermione. Harry and the others are also really part of the story tangentially, though Xander gets into a prank war with the Twins.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/12/][Ickle Ronnikins]] by Perspicacity.

It's a one-shot, buried in one of those "I'm putting a bunch of stories into one big file" collections that I am really beginning to hate and wish people would stop doing. But I digress.

Link goes straight to the appropriate chapter.
