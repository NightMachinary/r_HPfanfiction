:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I've spent the last hour looking for a fic I just can't recall the title of. In the story the Hogwarts house elves decide that they are overworked and need a break because the students discovered that they can make them do anything they want, like their homework and stuff. Harry decides to take charge in the kitchen to make sure that the students don't have to starve.

That's the basic concept. Maybe someone knows the title, this community is after all pretty effective when searching for something specific


** No matter, I've found it! For everyone who is interested, it's called "Not an Elf" by JAWorley and can be found on Potions and Snitches. Unfortunately I don't know how to link something from that page...

*** You can always link the old fashioned way: [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/viewstory.php?sid=3125&chapter=1][Not an Elf on Potions and Snitches]]

If you click the Formatting Help button, there's an example of how to post a link; just put [ ] square brackets around the words you want to display, and ( ) round brackets around the address you want it to link to, no space in between. So with the ] next to the (, or ](.
