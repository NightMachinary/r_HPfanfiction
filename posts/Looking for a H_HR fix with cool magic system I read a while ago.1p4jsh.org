I'm looking for a fic that was H/HR during the 6 yr of school, where they have a spell to monitor magic levels and harry's is never ending. They also discover a ritual to use his unending magic to give HR's parents magic and then them into wizards


** I don't think it's what you're looking for, but Sunset over Britain/Sunrise over Britain is similar. Harry's supercharged and Hermione's parents become magical.

** I can remember a similar story I've read but Harry and Hermione end up teaching DADA at Hogwarts while Hermiones parents attend. The thing is in this story they are only in there 4th or 5th year age wise. I'll look for it again though.
