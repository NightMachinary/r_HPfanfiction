I was thinking about how Wizards would play the floor is lava and then recalled that time Fred and George turned a corridor into a swamp, so my Prompt is them forcing everyone at Hogwarts to play along with their game by literally turning the floor into lava.


** "What were you two thinking? Of all the irresponsible things you have done this is the worst."

"We tho-"

"Shut Up. When Professor McGonagall learns about this you are going to be cleaning Snape's Cauldrons for the rest of your time at Hogwarts."

"Herm-"

"Have you gone deaf? I said SHUT UP. Why in the name of Merlin's-"

"HERMIONE"

"WHAT"

"You are blocking the entrance. Harry needs room to get out." She turned back and saw Harry with three crying first years clutching him desperately. Harry's face was red and he was sweating profusely. As soon as she moved he deposited the students down and she had to help him pry their hands off so he could go back in. She hated it. He was the only person insane enough to summon his broom as soon as he saw the Common Room filled with lava and go rescue students that were stranded.

He had sent Ron to bring the Professors and told her to take care of the students he rescued. It was a good thing that the dinner wasn't finished yet or there would have been a lot more students stranded. As it was most of the Gryffindors were still in the Great Hall when they had left so there should be just a hadful of students in there. She will kill the twins if something happened to Harry.

*** She heard the sound of people rushing towards them and looked down the corridor to see Headmaster and the other Professors rushing towards them with Ron leading the way.

Before any of the Professors could say anything Harry came zooming back. He had Dennis Creevey on the back of his broom holding on to him. Harry was flying with one arm and was clutching.. her beloved Crookshanks with his other. She had forgotten about him completely. The twins were dead. She was going to kill them. She heard a scream and looked on as Harry swayed dangerously. For a heart wrenching moment she thought they were going to fall and die. But then they stabilized. She looked up and saw Headmaster with his wand out and pointed at Harry. Professor Dumbledore had saved them.

She felt relief flow through her when they finally crossed the entrance. Harry let go of the broom and fell. Ron barely managed to catch him. Part of his sleeves were burnt off and she could see a really ugly burn. That was what happened. Madame Pompfrey was already waving her wand frantically over Harry as Ron held him. Dennis still had not let go of him and she could see Crookshranks digging his nails into his uninjured that was still securely around him. Harry's face was twisted in a pained grimace as Ron supported his weight while glaring murderously at the twins. The twins were struck with looks of horror on their face as they gazed at Harry's injured arm.

**** "What in Merlin's name happened to your arm?" said the Mediwitch, just barely keeping her outrage from turning it into a shout.

"'s the ground that's turned to lava. Not just downstairs, the dorms have floors too. Broke through like a waterfall" Harry managed through gritted teeth, the burn on his arm slowly being pulled out like thin smoke by her wand.

"Harry," Dumbledore had knelt down before the boy, "Is there anyone still inside?"

"Dunno. Couldn't see very well, most of the wood burned up and-" he coughed violently "-and there's smoke everywhere."

The elderly Headmaster swiftly stood up, bounded to the scorched entryway still belching smoke. He went unnaturally still, then his wand had begun flowing like water and an unearthly chill began emanating from his form. Even though he was turned away from them, it still settled into their bones like a winter day's frost.

After a few seconds of this, Dumbledore rushed into the now ice-encrusted entryway, the heads of house following after him.

***** A horrendous crash is heard by all. Stone is popping and groaning, wood is sizzling, a scream echoes from the girls' dorms. Professors McGonagall and Snape start that way, transfiguring the lava into obsidian along the way. They find the girl among the wreckage of a lava-fall. She looks like she was the entertainment for a Death Eater meeting, she probably wouldn't make it for long. Despite not flying much since the'91-'92 school year, Snape summons Potter's broom to reach the girl. Minerva is obviously the better transfigurist of the two whereas Serverus and Poppy are the best healers. Pomona not far behind with her herbal based healing. Snape's specialty is field healing thanks to his time among the Death Eaters. They'll need all hands on deck for this poor girl. She isn't even recognizable anymore.

****** Suddenly, there is a flash of fire in the air, brighter and somehow... purer than the surrounding flames. With a keening cry, Fawkes the firebird appears, and seems to gain immediate control over his element. The fires, which had been licking at the room's stone supports, quieted down as though struck, shying away from his currently fearsome form. A mighty beat of his wings, and most of the smoke in the dormitory is cleared by a blast of scorching hot air.

He glides over to Minerva, who had been trying her best to stabilize the girl, and pushes her back. Landing on an obsidian outcropping, he lowers his head, and three almost glowing tears fall what is left of her burned forehead.

Pheonix tears are a miraculous substance. They can only be given voluntarily, not forced out of the animal, which is uncontainable by anything other than another phoenix. They cannot be stored without losing most of their potency, and they are the most powerful if the phoenix itself feels sorrow while shedding them.

The healing process was as fascinating as it looked to be painful, but the phoenix did not seem willing to allow that to be so - he began to sing, unlike anything they had ever heard. Serverus had to grab onto one of the unburned supports and shore up his occlumentic defense, the unnatural drowsiness quickly overwhelming what he always maintained passively. Minerva managed to shift into her animal form to avoid stumbling, and the healing girl's screams quickly faded as the phoenix song sent her to sleep despite the pain.

Once she'd quieted completely, the phoenix landed on one of her arms, clasped his talons around it, and both vanished in an explosion of fire.

Instantly, the surrounding heat seemed to realize the departure of its elemental master, and bolstered upwards.

******* Serverus pops another wide-eye solution and offers one to Minerva. She yawns. Considering how much a cat sleeps on a normal basis perhaps turning into a cat wasn't the best idea, but at least she's not hurt. He gathers her up in his arms, outwardly grumbling about having to carry her around /again/. Internally he's looking forward to teasing her mercilessly and barely holds back a chuckle when she starts purring and kneading his arm.

Quickly coming to his senses, Serverus re-mounts Potter's broom, continuing his search of the dorms. He finds no other living creature; Potter did his impromptu job well. Albus would probably give the boy another award in services of the school. He returns to the corridor, empty save for Filius and Pomona, ready to help if someone else was found. They, too, were a bit drowsy having heard the phoenix's lullaby but they hadn't received the full force of it like he and Minerva had. The three heads of house, plus the unwitting fourth, made their way to the hospital wing to check on the Gryffindors.

Potter, Creevey, and the orange fluff monster were the worst off, but they would be free to go in a week. Both boys were suffering from magical and heat exhaustion, their bodies pushing the limits to survive. How long had they been in that smoke filled inferno? None of the conscious Gryffindors were talking to him, seeing as they thought he was holding their head of house captive or some such nonsense. She merely entangled her claws into his robes whenever he attempted to lay her down feeding more blackmail to the non-feline heads.

Poppy diagnosed Minerva and Serverus with moderate smoke inhalation from before Fawkes cleared the air and dehydration. However, cat-Minerva was being more obstinate than even the bat was normally so Poppy recommended Serverus taking her to his potions lab to treat her and himself away from prying eyes. The students were too busy gaping to focus on healing. Filius followed Serverus through the floo. Poppy had Granger and the Weasleys to play gopher for her so Flitwick offered to assist Serverus, besides, Pomona had gone to the greenhouse to pick a get-well-soon bouquet of catnip and he wanted to be there when she delivered it.

**** Heh. Yeah, definitely. Though I kind of love the idea of Crabbe and Goyle being Troy and Abed behind closed doors. :D

Really, most of Community's bigger plots would be great for HP Fanfics. The Meow-Meow Beans one with the friend-rating could be fun, same with the zombies, or the paintball (egad, the paintball could be amazing! Imagine a DADA teacher setting that chaos up :D).

** What if there was a minor consequence if you didn't make it in time. Like, scorched hair and/or clothes. I picture the lava being as hot as a hot tub, but I'm just trying to avoid the horrors of what real lava would do to Hogwarts and it's inhabitants.
