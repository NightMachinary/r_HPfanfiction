From what I understand from a whole load of other comments I've read, canon Harry would not be anywhere near as normal as he is. But I haven't ever heard about the actual behaviorisms he would have from that abuse. Is there a way for him to properly recover or would it always affect him?


** Those people are assuming that there is one "right" way for an abused/neglected child to act, and that isn't actually true. There is a wide array of possible reactions to chronic child abuse, and no two survivors will manifest the effects of said abuse in the same way. (This is half the reason why c-PTSD or developmental trauma disorder couldn't yet be included in the DSM-V.)

Canon Harry's reaction to the abuse he suffered is perfectly plausible. [[/u/straysayake][u/straysayake]] made a great [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HarryPotterBooks/comments/l1fhtw/deconstructing_harry_the_boy_in_ps_to_man_in_dh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3][essay]] outlining exactly how his abuse has informed his personality.

I know that it's a common sentiment in this sub that Harry's suffering should have made him much more bitter, crueler, or meaner than he was in canon. And of course, there are people who do turn out that way, but assuming that /all/ abused kids turn out like that is such an unfair and pessimistic assessment of the futures of these children.

Many grow up to be kind and gentle. Many learn to break the cycle of abuse. Many find families and loved ones to teach them that they deserve better and can be better than the people who raised them. Harry is an example of such a child, and he is no less of a survivor of abuse for learning and choosing to be kind.

Most importantly, one can definitely heal from the abuse Harry suffered. Not easily mind you, and certain scars last a lifetime. But it /is/ possible for such children to live out happy and wonderful lives despite that.

*** All very good points, and indeed Harry shows many traits of psychological [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_resilience][resilience]].

#+begin_quote
  Resilience is negatively correlated with personality traits of neuroticism and negative emotionality, which represents tendencies to see and react to the world as threatening, problematic, and distressing, and to view oneself as vulnerable. Positive correlations stands with personality traits of openness and positive emotionality, that represents tendencies to engage and confront the world with confidence in success and a fair value to self-directedness.
#+end_quote

This describes Harry's approach to the Dursleys to a T. He never really considers himself a helpless victim of them, but rather views them as a kind of adversary to be overcome. In doing so he is demonstrating the self-directed mentality of psychologically resilient individuals.

ALL THAT SAID, we must also remember that Harry Potter is a world where souls exist, and traditionally souls are considered to contain/determine your essential, immutable character.

A fair amount has been written about the deterministic, Calvanist theology implicit in much of the HP books. For all that JKR has characters talk about the importance of free will, basically all her characters are the opposite: Voldemort was basically born evil, Harry was basically born good.

JKR even described, on her old website, that by taking Lily's blood into himself, Voldemort had placed goodness into himself that would have permitted him redemption. So goodness, in JKR's view of the HP universe, is a tangible magical thing which can be interacted with and even moved around.

** The problem with this is that there is no general case, no "realistically". This is the first thing that any expert will tell you.

Growing up as Harry did (i.e., unloved, not taken care of, probably, in the modern sense, "neglected"), the result depends nearly 100% on the individual. There are many (in fact, if you trust some studies, even /most/) people that will come out perfectly okay. This is why you can't actually argue that Harry's Canon personality is "wrong". It's possible that he would be like that -- basically fine.

On the other hand, he could also have any number of issues. If you look at the studies, there's an increased risk for psychological problems. He could be suicidal. He could suffer depressions. He could have a trauma. There's also an increased risk for substance abuse. And of course, he could perpetuate the cycle -- he could himself be a bully. The "he bullies and hurt kids to compensate for feeling powerless at home before that" is clich√©, but it's also a thing. Sometimes.

And finally, it also needn't be static. If he has problems as a child, he needn't have them as an adult. If he did have problems, then being away from the source after 11 for 10/12 of a year can be the best thing that happened to him.

.

Basically, it's up to you, as a writer, to decide. You can make a case for any character you want. Personally, I focus on what interests me. And since Harry working through a ton of personal baggage doesn't interest me at all, not when you can write about magic instead, I'm very fine the with path Canon took. YMMV.

Guilt complexes can also happen. We can actually see elements of that in canon, how Harry always feels some way at fault for every casualty of the war.

** It's very variable. Everyone reacts in different and nuanced ways. It also depends a lot on the tools that you're given to deal with it. If you have other supports (close friends, mentors, a therapist) that can change things. Some people who are abused are very kind people. Some reenact those relationships throughout lives, others break the cycle. Mental health is a big factor too. C-PTSD can cause lasting problems that usually take treatment to get them under control. There's also hereditary mental illnesses that have a possibility of being triggered by stress and abuse.

It's possible that Harry is simply under so much stress in canon that he doesn't have the ability to process and deal with the abuse until later. I can also see why Rowling didn't want to go into a lot of detail about abuse recovery in her series.

TLDR, there are many valid and respectful interpretations of how Harry would be affected by abuse.

Trust issues were another good one, as was him hoarding food (admittedly, I stole that one).

The comments provided a few other interesting choices as well.

** Not everybody processes abuse the same. It is totally possible that an abused child like Harry could act like he does. It would be totally possible for him to be extremely troubled as result. It is totally possible that he reacts like he does in canon and grows into his character in Cursed Child (even likely, if he never got help or worked through it), it is possible for him to be well adjusted even.

** I think it's fine how canon Harry turned out. Abused kids are all different, so I don't think you can call his behavior "unrealistic".

If I had to label one of his characteristics as unbelievable though, I would definitely say how he treated the Dursleys. He constantly snarked at them and acted like they were a minor nuisance and not his abusers most of time, as if he never expected any retribution.

*** It's not that he doesn't expect retribution, it's just that he simply doesn't care what happens to him (which is also a manifestation of abuse, but a different one). He has little to no self preservation and runs head long into danger. What was he honestly expecting he would be able to do at the end of Philosopher's stone (lucky that his mother's sacrifice makes it such that Quirrel can't touch him), or Chamber of Secrets (Fawkes turned up with sorting hat, and Harry's best plan here is to /close his eyes/), or going to Ministry to rescue Sirius? At the end of PS, 11 year old Harry is grateful Dumbledore came because "I couldn't keep him off the stone much longer" and not "thank you, you saved my life". It simply doesn't occur to him.

That said, the narration does make it clear that Harry ducks and avoids things ("long experience told him that it was best to be out Uncle Vernon's arms reach" "he ducked when Aunt Petunia aimed her frying pan at him") and knows instinctively when to get out of the way.

*** When he feels that the Dursleys (or rather, Vernon) are a direct threat, he does show signs of fear. In COS, he is described as trembling and clutching hold of the mop in the aftermath of the pudding incident, and in POA, he freezes when he realises Ron has called and Vernon has answered. Incidentally, both these incidents end with a "fade to black" type scene, with Vernon displaying threatening/violent behaviour.

*** But his easy forgiveness of Ron is /also/ an effect of the abuse. Difficulty in setting boundaries and holding people you love accountable is very much a trauma response too. Harry has been alone for a long time, and Ron is one of the very first people to show him care and love. He is /desperate/ to have Ron stay in his life, so he doesn't even wait for Ron to apologize before welcoming him back with open arms. This is a very common problem for abuse survivors with attachments issues. It's half reason a lot of them seem to hop from one abusive situation to the next.

And another characteristic for abuse survivors is an inability to plan for the future. Harry not thinking and just impulsively doing whatever he wants is quite par for course. There are studies that show how chronic abuse can shrink someone's hippocampus and mess with the frontal lobe, both necessary for learning and forethought. (I'd link to the studies but I'm on mobile right now.) Abuse survivors not realizing they /can/ have a future is a well-documented thing.

The people you know aren't the golden standard for what abuse survivors should look like. There are way too many ways to manifest that effect to have a golden standard in the first place. Harry's reactions in canon are perfectly plausible as well.

** While the point most people seem to be making about there not being one way to react to abuse, I also want to mention that within the canon world, his mother loved him so much she died to save him. Her love is magically in his veins protecting him. I always figured that Harry didn't exhibit typical signs of a child who had love withheld from him, because he had that mother's love so embedded inside of him. My short answer to why Harry is the way he is would be 'magic'.

** if I were writing him, I'd make the following changes.

as a younger kid (pre-hogwarts to ~12/13), he'd be more jumpy, especially when he hangs out with the twins or other loud/handsy people. he'd probably desperately want to connect with people, but have no idea how to actually do it. he might act like a clown, because hey, positive attention! or he might just be superficially engaging, but never actually connect with his friends on any kind of deep level. Or both. class clown and friend group clown, because making people laugh is easier than being vulnerable.

as he got older, he'd hoard food, and/or have some kind of eating disorder. he'd display a diminished sense of self-worth, (though I'd argue that /is/ displayed in canon. healthy people would have (i think) a lot harder time literally walking to their death, responsibilities or prophecies be damned.)

he'd empathize more with underdogs. since he (in canon) seemed to respond to his upbringing by essentially being kind, I'd write it as him taking it further and identifying with beings who are generally considered "lesser" by the magical community.

Or, maybe he would take it to unhealthy extremes and basically just have no personal boundaries and he'd help anyone with anything he could, no matter how many times it bit him in the ass.

** As others have pointed out, it's tough to have an exact answer. That said, if he was physically abused, he'd probably be a tad bit more adverse to touches and angry adults. If it was verbal abuse, he'd try not to draw as much attention to himself.

Mental abuse, however, definitely leads to him hoarding things he may feel like he'd lose, such as friends, food, hobbies, and all around acting how he does in canon. Which makes me think that was the Dursleys favorite method of abusing Harry.

Small space as his bedroom? He'd cling to openness. Bread and butter for every meal? He'd go all out for candy and any real food. Gifts? He'd be in shock at a notion. An adult that cares about him? Sure, he'll use that to try and combat the negative feelings he has about not being worthy.

Worst part is that mental abuse--and just to clarify, I consider emotional abuse as mental abuse due to how easily the two slip into one another--can be covered up with low self-esteem. A counselor would have to build up trust before getting the truth, and the abusers have time to make sure he doesn't talk. It's a bad spiral

** Honestly, cannon Harry is mostly fine, the only real issue I have is that he never seemed to 'get' that Quirrell died from his touch, to the point where he didn't see Thestrals until he saw Cedric's death. The level of detatchment to ignore the violent death of a man at his hand is kinda unnerving and doesn't really fit with the rest of his character. That said, most people seem to ignore it, so maybe I'm just getting bugged over nothing.
