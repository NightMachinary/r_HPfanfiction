It seems like an interesting topic.

Preferably over 100k words, 70k the lowest i'm willing to go.


** The most obvious one is [[https://www.amazon.com/Potter-Cursed-Special-Rehearsal-Script/dp/1338099132/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1476977475&sr=1-1&keywords=cursed+child][Harry Potter and the Cursed Child]]

I've read tons of fics about Harry as Head Auror, Headmaster, Minister, Dark Lord, DADA Professor, successful Entrepreneur, retired Hermit, PTSD basket case, and psycho Killer, but never as a department head.

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1976, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter, 1976

**** off the top of my memory this was good though. Worth the read. Also take into account that it was last updated about 2 months ago so it could be a WIP
