I found on either here or [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]] a link in comments to a fan fiction where Lily and James were still alive, Lily met Emma Granger in a doctors surgery and they became close friends. Lily went to Petunia to tell her Dudley may be in trouble/they may be in trouble and Lily put the love protection spell on Dudley. Voldemort went after Petunia, Vernon and Dudley, leaving only Dudley alive and Lily and James took in Dudley as their own but they were staying at Emma Grangers house with Hermione and her dad.

Does this ring a bell to anyone? I was really enjoying it and I am heartbroken that I have lost it!!

  Could a chance meeting change history? What would a different Halloween in 1981 mean for wizarding Britain?
