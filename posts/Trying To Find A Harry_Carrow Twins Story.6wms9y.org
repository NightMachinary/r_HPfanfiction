**** I remember this story.

I read it solely for the pairing. Not the plot.

**** After what her family went through I can understand that she wants bloody revenge. She wants to make others feel the pain her family has to endure. She wants to see the other side in pain, no matter if the individual punished is guilty of crimes or guilty due to family ties. And since she is not known to be kind it could be well within character if the author decides to give her the personality of Joffrey Baratheon/Waters. It is not a pleasant characterisation but not entirely unreasonable.
