After all, they will have no resources so an orphan's background fits. Might throw in a bit of abuse so the child doesn't go looking too deeply at their background.

​

And with all the wizarding families that died in previous wars, you might as well slip in some extant connection to one of the extinct families. Since there are no assets attributable to them, no-one will overly care, and the kids will think they have some wizarding blood.

​

After all, I'm sure nothing bad could happen by some poor muggleborn thinking they really descended from Salazar Slytherin.

*cough*

I don't think anything like this exists, but if there is please link ;).

** "Luna, why are you dragging me inside the classroom?" Harry asked. He had just met her on the train, and she seemed nice enough, but with Voldemort back one never knew.

"Don't worry, Harry. I'm trying to help you."

As soon as he sat down at a desk, he turned around to demand when Luna said, "Sorry Harry, this had to be done. /Obliviate/!"

------------

He woke up to find two women and an old man arguing at the end of his bed. By the looks of it, He was in some hospital, probably. Why was his head hurting so badly?

The old man noticed him awake, and quickly gave him water to drink. He promptly sat up and complied.

"How are you feeling, child?"

"Head... hurts."

"Poppy? Do give him a Pepper-Up, will you?"

"You know I can't wh---"

"I have to insist, Ms Pomfrey."

She huffed. "Very well. I /will/ be putting this in his official records."

"Do what you must."

She huffed again, but reached into a cupboard and pulled out what the old man had called a 'pepper-up.'

"Drink this, my dear," she said kindly.

Since he didn't see any malice from the group, he shrugged. Why not? The headache was killing him as is, a poison might finish the job faster.

He gulped it down, and immediately the pain was gone. He looked the weirdly shaped bottle in wonder. If he had this all the time the bullies had beaten him...

"What do you remember, boy?" the old man asked.

He tried and tried, but he couldn't remember how he got to this hospital.

"Uh, I... don't know, sir. I can't remember anything."

"What is the last thing you remember?" The lady who had remained quiet for a while now spoke.

"A bunch of boys chasing me? I don't know. My head feels whoozy."

"What else?"

He tried, but nothing came to his mind.

"I don't even remember my name!" He shouted, panicking.

"Calm down. We are here to help you."

The boy didn't calm down at all.

"I don't know my bloody name! Who am I? How did I got here?"

The old man waved a stick at him, and he instantly felt very calm and peaceful, almost as if all his emotions were being suppressed.

"Do you know my name?"

"Indeed I do, Tom Marvalo Riddle."

------------

Damn I love the idea. If anyone likes, feel free to expand upon this.

**** Well, there's this thing in the Potterverse where abused children occasionally explode and unleash a murder-demon that wipes out the neighbourhood. A kid who has been kidnapped because he has magic may, if it was a happy home, come to hate and suppress his magic, which is given as the main factor in such cases.

He dropped him by accident, and because it's meant to be a whimsically funny tale, he got distracted by macarons. Or macraroons. Can't remember which.

*** Hypothetically, some purebloods believe that the greater harm comes from leaving magical children to be raised by muggles.

The following metaphor is not perfect, but I think some purebloods would agree with it; a child is born with perfectly functional legs. His parents, grandparents, siblings, pediatricians, teachers, classmates, neighbors, literally everybody else in the entire world, as far as the child knows, were not born with legs, and get around via wheelchair. The kid is popped in a wheelchair from birth. His classmates call him a freak for having weird, gangly growths off his pelvis. His parents freak out at him everytime he tried to use his legs. At best, they might be trying to keep him from hurting himself with those bizarre, gangly growths. At worst, they are disgusted and ashamed of having given birth to him, and just want him to be "normal". His pediatricians raise the possibility of corrective surgery, to remove the bizarre, gangly growths. He needs a custom-built wheelchair to accommodate the growths. Then, when he turns eleven, his family suddenly learns that those medieval myths of people born with legs were true. There's actually an entire reclusive city of people born with legs, and an entire school that teaches children parkour, gymnastics, dancing, and marathon training. The city loves athletics competitions, and there's a new competition every week. The parents are pursuaded, by any means necessary, to allow their kid to go to the school. Now, the kid has been stuffed into a wheelchair his whole life, and his legs have atrophied. He will need to go to a hospital to repair the damage, and he might never reach the level of his classmates at the new school.

This metaphor is filled with problems, but I think it's accurate to how some purebloods would see it, at least the purebloods who would be inclined to "rescue" muggleborns instead of exclude them.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.
