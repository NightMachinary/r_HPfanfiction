I'm looking for some well written, well crafted Pre Hogwarts Fanfiction. Anything very long would be good. I would like ones that both emulate Rowling's writing style and stick closely to the cannon story line. I don't mind any website. I'm looking for: Marauders era (all years at Hogwarts +Lilly and James post Hogwarts) Albus Dumbeldore (Pre & Post Hogwarts + years of teaching before headmaster) Remus Lupin (Pre Hogwarts) Molly & Arthur (Pre, Post and during Hogwarts) Tonks (Pre, Post and During Hogwarts) Bill/Charlie Weasley (during Hogwarts) Any suggestions would be brilliant!


** Against the Moon is a fantastic read. It's Remus centric though, obviously.
