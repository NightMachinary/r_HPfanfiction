I cannot express how annoyed I am with people /demanding/ me to update one, or several of my fics.

Guess what, dumbass, this isn't my job. I've never seen any money from you so how come /you/ make demands? How come you dare to order me around or issue fucking */deadlines/*?

The nerve of some people.

What kind of constant participation award winner do you have to be to think any form of demand is alright on a platform like FFN? Write your own goddamn stories!


** I've read loads of authors notes saying that if people saying they would like updates encourages them to write more, because they feel appreciated, so maybe this doesn't go for everyone.

Then again, I don't think anybody likes having demands made of them, let alone for something they do for free and for fun.

** I think I'm the opposite. If I see a lot of demand, I feel inclined to actually sit down and dump out a quality chapter for them. I'm not writing for myself. I'm writing for other people.

It's a fine line, though. I have thick skin, at least on the internet, and don't care if people abuse me or my mother. If you abuse me or be passive-aggressive, that's how I'll respond to you. Heck, I may even make a character about you then humiliate them. Take that, internet person.

*** As a fellow Slytherin, I also felt the need to chime in.

To a degree, I was also the same way...until I ended up getting spam-fucked into oblivion when my growing audience started reviewing/PMing me for "more" as soon as I would post a new chapter. At least one also told me that they were suicidal, and that "new content from me was the only thing keeping me from killing themselves".

The hordes of people constantly demanding "new content" from me, with the sense of entitlement / expectation that I would immediately and automatically cater to their demands (especially the suicide threat), eventually caused me to stop writing the story altogether. I also pulled all fanfictions from my FF.net account.

For the record, this wasn't even HP fanfiction. It was /Rise of the Guardians/ fanfiction. Looking back, it wasn't even that good.

** So I'm going to take an unpopular opinion here. Part of your problem (not all of it though) seems to come from you. And that is kind of a good thing. Let me explain.

Most authors write because they enjoy writing and like to feel what they write is appreciated. This is where the problem starts. Because as a reader I know if I like someone's work, I'm going to look forward to reading more of it. If your writing isn't good I'm not going to care when you update. So as a reader, I might ask when their next update is. If the author has established some sort of regular update schedule and given me that expectation of an update, at a certain time I will be upset, disappointed, and frustrated when an update is really late or just not present. The problem is that not everyone is reasonable in their frustration and you get the problem you have on your hands.

The thing to take away from this is that you are a good writer and your writing is interesting enough to create a fanbase around it. Yes, even the asshole demanding an update is just confirming to you that he enjoys your work.

At the end of the day, do whatever you want. It's your story. My personal view is that it is easier to ignore these sort of people rather than get riled up. They shouldn't really be worth your time. You've given them a response when they don't even deserve that.

*** A lot of stories are done as a writing exercise, (especially on spacebattles) a couple of betas alone cannot help you improve. In a lot of longer stories, you can really see the writer improve. Obvious examples are the improvement in the quality of Diane Castle's stories or Starfox5's, huge leaps in a relatively short period. On Spacebattles it is pretty visible for writers like Hiver or Fulcon.

The downside of course is authors who don't know what to write and end up asking the audience what pairing etc, but sometimes it can be useful to have someone who stops you from going ahead with a really stupid idea.

*** Major thumbs up to you for doing this.

I read a lot of fan fiction. One one hand, I can understand where the OP is coming from. On the other hand though, it can be unbelievably frustrating as a reader to constantly find a great story that the author is updating regularly that then, suddenly, stops being updated.

I completely understand writers block, but a lot of frustration on reviewers parts could easily be removed if authors in general would just put up a post saying "hey, still working on this. Muse is currently MIA, but it's not abandoned." Obviously, I don't know if the OP is having long periods between updates that is causing their stories to get these rude responses, but I do think that they can, to some extent, be avoided.

All that said, thank you for being one of those rare writers who finishes their stories before putting them up. It's always sad to find an awesome story that never gets finished.

**** I do it that way mainly because I'm a bit disorganised and I know my own shortcomings. If I posted as I wrote, I might very well not finish -- and I would definitely keep wanting to go back and change things or add foreshadowing and so on. So it just makes more sense for me to get it all written first. Plus I'll freely admit I don't write very popular stories and I think it would be quite hard to keep motivated without getting any reviews. I have seen writers give up for that reason - never mind getting too many of the 'wrong sort' of reviews! But it's an individual choice and we all work differently.
