So apparently occlumency isn't just defense against the spell legilimens but also can be used to evade veritaserum. So that had me thinking if dementors effects can be fought with enough skill. As well as veela. Can people attracted to veela potentially evade their effect by occlumency?


** I think it would work in the short term but not long-term.

Someone who was at Hogwarts during the 1993/4 year might have been able to use Occlumency to stave off the bad memories while walking past Dementors or even having to deal with them while orchestrating a search.

However someone imprisoned in Azkaban would find their Occlumency quickly failing them due to the constant strain of it as well as the physical stressors - poor food and little of it, poor sleep, cold etc - and once your bad memories swamped you once, getting back to a state of emotionlessness would be very hard. Within anywhere from a week to a month they'd be in the same boat as everyone else.

** I dont think it wold work against dementors.

The dementors don't really seem like they trying to affect the minds of their victims, but rather that the effect it has on it, is merely a by product of them feeding on the happy emotions.

But I do think it would work against a veela's charm, since that seems be something that directly tries to alter the mind of the victims, and the way Snape described occlumency implies that it would defend against this.

*** Good point - though I think it does matter on the interpretation of occlumaency that we take. If occlumancy is capable of controlling ones emotions, I could see the argument that it could be used to 'hold in' one's happy emotions, becoming more 'dead' to the dementors.

After all, Snape /does/ say that one should empty themselves of emotions for occlumency, and that should include happy emotions. It also involves a lot of controlling your own emotions - again including happy ones.

That being said, I would expect even a more generous fandom interpretation of the powers of occlumency to have this particular usage of it be both very advanced and very difficult - dementors seem /very/ powerful at drawing forth those happy memories and emotions, and the occlumens would probably heavily struggle at keeping a grip on themselves, particularly over long periods of time. It'd also seem to be more temporary - unlike the patronus, it can't drive the dementors away, so it's more just delaying the inevitable.

**** Occlumency doesn't seem to grant any form of control over ones own emotion, instead it seems to require the control from the user to practice occlumency in the first place. So I dont think the mundane control over your own emotion would prevent magic from affecting it.

***** I think occlumency is built upon control of one's emotions - Snape often enough snaps at Harry about controlling his anger, and the way I read it (though it's been a while) is that controlling and projecting the right emotion is important to fooling legilimency.

That's why I mentioned that it matters on the take of occlumency that the writer takes - because your argument as to how well it could handle magic is perfectly valid, but I don't think that it's the only valid conclusion from canon - nor from a more fleshed out magic system.

For instance, I would think that a cheering charm would make occlumency /harder/ to use, but not impossible. That's a magical effect on one's emotions, just like dementors - though presumably weaker. Do you think emotion/emotional state altering spells like that would be able to help break through occlumency defenses, or would they just make it harder to maintain? I fall in the latter category personally.

****** Thats my point, controlling your own emotion is a requirement to use occlumency, not a result of it, meaning in the end any emotional control you have would be of the non magical kind, so not overly useful against a magical attack. It would be Occlumency itself which protects the user against foreign influences, not the control over the emotion.

******* IDK - I think occlumency and practicing does affect one's controls over emotions, even over the magically induced ones. Again, that's my interpretation of it, and I can tell yours disagrees - which is perfectly fine in this case! It's written vaguely enough that both are valid enough IMO, particularly for fanfic purposes.

*** It's a *retcon*.

Rowling realized that Veritaserum would introduce plot holes into a lot of her stories so she made the statement that Occlumency can circumvent the potion. However, that also introduces plot holes because I don't believe for an instant that Crouch Jr wouldn't be skilled in Occlumency, since he had to impersonate Moody.

#+begin_quote
  “you don't need me --- you could use Legilimency ... or Veritaserum. ...”

  “Professor Slughorn is an extremely able wizard who will be ex­pecting both,” said Dumbledore. “He is much more accomplished at Occlumency than poor Morfin Gaunt, and I would be aston­ished if he has not carried an antidote to Veritaserum with him ever since I coerced him into giving me this travesty of a recollection.
#+end_quote

This is from the /Half Blood Prince/. I take this statement as meaning Occlumency being a defence against Legilimency and Veritaserum having an antidote.

** I think no, or at least very little, since dementors seem to interact with the soul, and occlumency with the mind, and those seem to be quite separate things. I have no idea what to think about the veela part, I suppose they effect the mind since they make people behave differently? So if that is true I think occlumency working with them would make sense, but they might be effecting hormone production or something, in which case I'd be going with no.

** I don't think Occlumency is going to help you at all against a Dementor's Kiss. However, I do believe that it could protect you from the general aura of despair, allowing you to cloak yourself from them somewhat, meaning there's a much smaller chance of you getting their attention in first place.

This also explains why Harry was both very susceptible to Dementors, and why he was also hopeless at Occlumency -- he is very open emotionally (making him useless at Occlumency) and have a lot of bad memories, which combined makes him very susceptible to them.

** Veritaserum thing is a retcon, so considering it canon or not is up to preference, really. If you do, you are directly contradicting what was said in the books, if you don't, you are contradicting what Rowling came up with after the books were all released in a futile attempt to close off some of the many plot holes.

In my opinon, Occlumency could be used to defend against them on a superficial level, pushing the bad memories Dementors are drudging up away from the forefront of your mind. But the Dementor's Kiss implies that Dementors target the soul, not the mind. So, like, it could help you focus on casting a Patronus in the middle of a group of Dementors by not focusing on the bad memories, but you'd still feel the effects. This is my headcanon, at least.

** I agree with some of the other comments here - I feel like it would help with some specific tasks -mdepending on mechanisms.

For example, dementors seem to operate by bringing negative memories to the forefront and burying good memories, which suggests that they use a rudimentary form of mind-reading to identify negative memories.

Veela don't operate based on any conscious memory, they just manipulate a very basic instinct (i.e. lust, or the sex drive) so my headcanon is you'd need a different type of defence against that (say, controlling your lust!).

None of us knows for sure what the limits of occlumency are, not just because of JKR being deliberately vague, but also because what she does tell us is through Harry's filter, and Snape's very unsuccessful lessons. I do get tired of people using it as if it was this super power granting immunity to weaknesses that affect literally everybody else with a mind.

** My headcanon is that dementors leech the happiness from happy memories but not the love from loving ones.Eventually the happy memories are drained of the happiness and therefore it gives incentive to go out and make more.Occlumency allows you to hold a happy or loving memory around them to form a patronus. I also think thats why Harry is so resistant later on and can form a patronus so easily as the memory he uses (his mums death) is full of love but no happiness.
