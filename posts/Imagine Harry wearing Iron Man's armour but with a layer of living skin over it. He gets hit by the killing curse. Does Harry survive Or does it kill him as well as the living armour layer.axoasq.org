** I'm of the opinion that Magic works on a symbolic level. The Killing Curse is known to be impossible to shield against and therefore is.

Even if you have a reasonable and solid logical reasoning for believing that some type of armor should grant you shielding from the Killing Curse would literally be your undoing. /You/ would consider it a shield and, therefore, the Killing Curse would sail right through it.

** Interesting question. It seems to be generally accepted that the Killing Curse can be blocked, but not shielded. But not blocked by clothes. Is armor clothes?

*** Probably. Otherwise wizards would be wearing it when they go into battle. My headcanon is that anything that could be considered a part of you wouldn't protect you against the Killing Curse. Clothes, armor, wand, necklace, possibly even physical shields.

** That's actually a difficult question since the killing curse goes through clothes but otherwise explodes. There is no canon indication on the effectiveness of armour, spaced or otherwise. Spaced armour should, in theory, protect you from the killing curse, but then you have a lot of molten metal flying towards you. So you probably need to wear a second layer of armour. Weight is not an issue with magic, but it would be very bulky and hinder movement considerably. Power armour would help with that, but you would still be restricted compared to regular armour or none.

** Extension: with magic it would be more than easy to "airgap" the space between the armour and the external skin with a significant amount of space due to magicals' ability to manipulate spacial dimensions. If sliced in half, from the outside it could look like it's coating it but actually have a foot of space or more between armour and external skin when viewed cut-on.

** Headcanon that the spell, when it doesn't literally hit a living body, sends out 'radiation.' The 'radiation' only extends a scant inch or so from where the spell terminated, but isn't blocked by whatever touched it. If the 'radiation' encounters a living body, then the full force of the spell is directed into the body and targets the soul, decoupling it from the body.

The explosion from a miss comes from the targeting radiation not finding an applicable target and the energy not having a place to discharge, and so physically burning/erupting.

** So. ArmorSkin > Armor > HarrySkin.

If there isn't any air gap anywhere between any of the three layers, he's dead.

ArmorSkin "conducts" the killing curse to the Armor which conducts to Harry.

******** Nonono take a look at armor it's not just chunks of metal hanging on someone. I'm not talking about two sets of armor. When they wear armor it's the plate, chain under said plate then leather under that chain. So what would happen would be the curse would hit explode the front plate would be turned into shrapnel then stopped by the chain and dragon hyde chest peice. It's not a very high explosion bronze is able to stop it without shattering the statues in the ministry atrium.

********** That is assuming it can cause enough damage to get through. So far this conversation has been under the assumption the curse explodes on contact with not living things. But what if it's a electric based spell it would explain why it kills with no Mark and why it explodes with contact with Stone.

************ In the atrium battle Dumbledore blocks using chunks of stone that explode when hit with the curse. The reason I was suggesting an electric based spell is it leaves no mark when it kills it can hit anywhere and kill someone. It explodes stone that was used to block the spell but not the bronze statue that Dumbledore animated to defend Harry. Bronze would conduct the electricity and disperse it rather than absorb and explode.

Electricity can leave plenty of marks when killing someone.

The statues were made out of Stone which did explode. Voldemort never really target Harry(outside the possesion). Film Version was a bit diffrent.
