I'm looking for what the title says. I want harry to be powerful and smart but also have to work to be powerful and smart like him in Harry Potter and the boy who lived. I would prefer longer fics. Any pairing except romione,hinny and snarry. Thank you so much!

So you might be confused when you read this, but I suggest you keep it in mind as I will be continuing it later on and it is exactly what you will want

Also I hated the original and felt I made it too unrealistic and that wasn't what I was going for

** Any fic by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/8024050/TheBlack-sResurgence][TheBlack'sResurgence]] is good. Strong Harry with non-usual pairings.

linkffn( 13140418 ) Good long ongoing fic. Has a very detailed background on magic. Similar to A Cadmean Victory but with more politics and a multi-pairing.

#+begin_quote
  A disillusioned Harry Potter begins to unravel his potential as the wizarding world follows the Triwizard Tournament. Harry delves into a world that is much greater, and more complicated, than he was aware of. The story contains detailed magic, politics, social situations and complicated motivations. It is a story of growth and maturation.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

***** The way that the goblins are viewed in many fanfics are a bit disturbing, too. Like yes, they're written to be evil, terrible creatures in canon (which is just garbage when it comes to the sapient non-humans overall), but they also seem to play into classic anti-semitic tropes (money grubbing bankers, hook-nosed, untrustworthy, always plotting to overthrow the wizards, etc).

I don't think JKR meant for that to be the case, and it's not the case that every anti-goblin fic is going to be because of that - but it is something that's in the back of my mind whenever I see an author decide to make the goblins super evil and righteously destroyed. Which makes it hard to enjoy them, even if I were inclined to find the idea of intrinsically evil intelligent species interesting.

Sorry, went on a bit of a tangent there :P
