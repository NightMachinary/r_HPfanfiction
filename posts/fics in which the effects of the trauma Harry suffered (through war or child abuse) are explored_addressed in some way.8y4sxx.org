** Chary Potter and the Years of Reluctance linkffn(Chary Potter and the Years of Reluctance): when confronted, he literally wants to go find a closed place like his cupboard to hide in.

The Mind Arts linkffn(The Mind Arts): Harry is sort of an emotional vampire

Harry Potter and the Nightmare of Futures Past linkffn(Harry Potter and the Nightmare of Futures Past) : its actually time-travel PTSD, but it does come up.

The Darkness Within linkffn(The Darkness Within): this one is kind of hard to explain. I honestly feel less sympathy for Harry than usual.

  Friendless, bullied, seen as worthless by the Dursleys, Harry's natural rebellious and adventurous nature was repressed. Life was only bearable if he kept out of the way so he grew up unwilling to step out of line. He lives by his wits but has high ideals and courage below the surface. Harry is simply reluctant to draw attention to himself --- it's less painful that way! H/G. Ron/Hm.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

** [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127417][Saving Harry by The Seeker]]\\
Summary: What if JKR had never intended the Harry Potter series to be for children? How would Harry's time at the Dursleys been written? This story focuses on the years Harry lived in the cupboard under the stairs at number four Privet Drive, as well as his first appearance at Hogwarts. The treatment he receives during his decade there is not described in fairy tale terms. The boy who initially develops is not the Harry Potter we know. The story is liberally AU, with different personality traits, events, and relationships used to reflect the changes in this very different Harry and the environment in which he grew up. In the end, through the assistance of a certain redheaded young lady, Harry ultimately finds the life he should have had and rediscovers the qualities he always had inside of him. While I am not a psychologist or child development expert, the symptoms, actions, and behaviors portrayed reflect the realities of child abuse. Appropriate disclosures will be contained in the Author's Notes above the chapter when warranted.
