I have a lot of plot bunnies about this, all of which I am too lazy to write, so I'm hoping someone else already wrote it. I feel like Bill would've been caught off guard by all the responsibilities of the position. Even as a prefect, Bill had been pretty laid-back, and he wasn't one to scold students or take his job too seriously. But once he's named Head Boy, the job forces him to be way more uptight than he normally is, and I see him potentially clashing with Charlie at some point when Charlie wants to bend the rules.

So... yeah. Obviously the stories you guys suggest don't have to have that arc. I'm just curious what's out there.
