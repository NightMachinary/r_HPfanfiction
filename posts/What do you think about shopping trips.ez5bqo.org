It's a pretty common trope that at the beginning of the fic the main character goes shopping and buys a bunch of cool and overpowered stuff that then isn't used for most of the fic.

In my story I mentioned that the character went shopping in like two paragraphs but I don't plan to mention the items until they become plot relevant.

What do you think is the better approach?

  Shortly before dying, Merope Gaunt gave birth to a pair of twins. As an infant, Mary Riddle was adopted by a caring family, leaving Tom alone at the orphanage. Naturally, when the twins reconcile at Hogwarts, they feel a great deal of affection for one another---affection that most would consider abnormal between a brother and a sister.

*** I tried my best to subvert the standard shopping trip in linkffn(12610360). First try goes wrong, second try explores the rest of the wizarding district of London (Knockturn + other non-canon alleyways).

  Down in the Chamber of Secrets, as Harry was dying from the basilisk venom, something awoke within his blood that began changing him, body, mind, and soul. The destruction of the horcrux in his head kicked that process in the metaphorical balls. Now, what are Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, and Harry to do as a literal five-headed dragon? (some fluff, no bashing, not power wank.)

** Either can work for different reasons. It's similar to when the protagonists outline the plan before a big heist: if the audience knows exactly what /should/ happen, the plan has to fail (or have lots of complications). If the audience only knows vague aspects of the plan, they can be surprised by the twists when things work out. Both are useful for creating conflict / tension. Think /Inception/ vs. /Oceans 11/.

So, if you list all the stuff the character buys, the audience will expect those things to come into play somehow. If you only give vague details, you can pull out items whenever, but it might not be as satisfying of a reveal.

** I have just started work on my first long fan fiction and I do have a shopping trip in my first chapter where my character purchases a few things. I used this mainly to help with a few aspects of my character development.

I had planned to mention only one of the items regularly throughout my story but thanks to this I will add a few mentions of the other products throughout the narrative.

** I don't mind shopping trips per se, but they rarely serve any purpose besides pointless filler, which makes it completely pointless to have in a fic. If a shopping trip is done in an original way, I wouldn't mind it.

Perhaps omitting it entirely would be odd if the fic centers on a First Year or similar, but there is really no need for it to take up an entire chapter if you aren't adding anything to it. You could just mention "he went to Diagon Alley for his school supplies, the end" in that case.

*** I am quite your opposite, it seems. I might just cry if I read “he went to Diagon Alley for his school supplies, the end,” lol. Even when it focuses on first year, perhaps especially if, shopping trips often show me a lot about how the author is thinking for the first year, and how it'll go. Based on what is introduced when shopping and/or what is focused more on.

** It depends on the writing style honestly. A good author can make a shopping scene enjoyable with descriptive scene setting, adequate but not heavy handed foreshadowing, and self limitations. One of the problems with shopping trips is that they became formulaic, so many new writers followed the same pattern as used in the fifa they liked.

It became very tired and very predictable. Harry has special conversation with Goblins, Harry buys special trunk, Harry buys more books, Harry buys a wand holster, Harry buys super cool gadgets, Harry makes sure to get shrinking and lightening charms applied to everything.

What makes a good shopping trip is writing in a way that the common tropes aren't emphasized but that the whole thing doesn't read rushed, like a shopping list with small descriptions rather than a shopping trip. Also a balance of Harry knowing/discovering/realizing what he wants. Having a character suddenly realize something in their internal monologue usually comes across as bad writing.

** I love realistic shopping scenes! Show me them buying a lot of stuff, and maybe seeing other things he likes but doesn't need. I love seeing characters buying quill and parchment, and maybe notebooks (because who wants to keep track of all that loose parchment). I also love to see how different authors choose to handle the “trunk situation.” Everyone does it a bit differently, and I love reading it.

** Honestly, the better approach would be to limit the use of gimmicks since magic and especially transfiguration make it easy to create whatever you need, within reason.

Shopping trips can be ok if something else happens (eg Harry witnesses a murder or makes a friend). But if it's just about gearing up, those tend to get tedious very quickly, especially with all the unnecessary details.
