After I read it I actually had to re-read the books to make sure that /that/ wasn't the actual standard level of quality of the series and I had somehow missed it. Guaranteed, it is not quite ‚Äúmy immortal‚Äù level of bad but that is /really/ not that hight of a bar.

It was more of like take canon Neville and try to imagine him having sex. He certainly doesn't look like he is getting banged so he is probably inexperienced. Not to mention he looks like he would rather not be in charge. There is nothing wrong with it. Ok here's the thing. I'm a dom and my partner is a dom, so we have this like battle for dominance. And I enjoy it.

Maybe that's why. I did the same thing with Harry as I did here with Neville

**** By what we know from the books (original 7), the guys are physically similar enough, and not attractive to me, but one has only ever been a normal down-to-earth guy, living humbly and doing the best he could for his family, while the other dreamt big and, as he himself agrees, through his greatness his mistakes were proportionally greater. And he made a lot of those.

And at the end of the day, either Albus is still a self-righteous asshat, which is eww, or he is redeemed after he got down from his high horse and wised up - which is intimidating, it'd be like sexing up a less-sexy Buddha.
