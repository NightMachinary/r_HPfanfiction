** "As you can see, Dolores Umbridge has deigned to grace us with her presence today," Snape said. "I would request you to show her your best work, but I suspect that would cause her to retreat to her office and sob inconsolably for hours at the utter degradation of the Hogwarts curriculum your incompetence has necessitated, so I shall merely request you refrain from blowing things up."

** Harry describing Snape to this therapist:

/"I mean I know I can't ever view him from a non-biased perspective. To me he's disgusting, petty, painful to look at, his voice sounds worse than nails on a chalkboard, his attitude is so horribly selfish, childish, cruel, and unfeeling, that I naturally assume everyone else finds him unworthy of oxygen. And it's not our job to deny him that oxygen, but if a car swerved to avoid him in the street, it wouldn't be for his sake, but to avoid dirtying the tires, you know? I wouldn't particularly take pleasure in his pain or seeing him break down if he were forced to look in the mirror for once both in the metaphorical and literal sense. But in an ideal world 'Severus' would only ever be a word used to describe the bacteria you have to rinse off the clamps down in laundry for the eco-friendly reusable colostomy bags. Where Jorge on his second day of the job would walk up to his supervisor and point to his hand, 'I got this rash growing.' To which, the supervisor would take one look at all the oozing puss and spores and say, 'Woo! Careful there. You got a bad case of Severus. Come on, I got some Snape Oil Ointment in the trailer.'

**** Hmm, to be fair, this is from an one-shot metafic, linkffn(Therapeutic discussions by nonjon) where Nonjon was making Harry have dreams of fanfiction tropes - like Snape being his dad, or being sexed my veela!Draco - which led to this venting. It was essentially the author ranting about the state of fanfiction at the time, albeit in a very funny, creative way.

In his longer stories, Harry does have a small jerk element, but he always has a heart of gold, I've found (or asbestos anyway - kudos if you get the reference). Which sort of balances things out.

***** Actually I'd argue between the Harrys of A Black Comedy Where In The World is Harry Potter it's the latter Harry that has the asbestos (though in both cases im sure Harry is plenty long :P). The only times I remember ABC Harry being a jerk to anyone that wasn't an acceptable target were getting a drunk to move seats and accidentally doing so to Lily while under big emotional stress and instinctively fulfilling a need to make a certain distinction (I give a bit of an "it's understandable" pass to what they did to the readmitted member of the Black family and they did all they could to fix it once they realized what happened)

WitWiHP Harry, for all that he is close enough with them to know they can take it, does jerk his friends around, especially Hermione (how he treats the reveal of you-know what, "double dating", "time-traveling" and being saved by Dobby, the "appearance" of a certain librarian's ghost (relatively minor, but still taunting her with her worst fear)) and though they don't know it the Weasley Twins (I consider everything in the prank war to be fair, so namely the addition to their family).

***** Can't remember exactly but it was something along the lines of this (you'll know exactly what I'm talking about if you've read one too many mediocre fics - for your sake I hope you don't then!):

Evil Sneering Draco: Hey mudblood.

Sycophantic Crowd: Gasp!

Supermodel Hermione: Hey Draco, if you were any more inbred what would you be?

Draco flaps his mouth open and shut like a fish, amazed and appalled that a mudblood knows how to speak. Pansy starts turning red with rage. Crabbe and Goyle do nothing because they've not been mentioned once in the entire fic (all 600,000 meandering words of it), presumably due to the author forgetting they existed.

Supermodel Hermione: A /sandwich!/

Crowd loses their collective shit.

Tears of humiliation start gathering in the corners of Dracos eyes as Malfoy Sr. disowns him and Narcissa throws away his favourite teddy bear named Voldums.

Supermodel Hermione flips her hair over her shoulder, wearing a confident smirk highlighted by her red lipgloss (or whatever's cool on the playground these days) as she exits stage left. Meanwhile Harry finally realises that he's in love with her, Ron eats three dead pigs in one sitting and oh god now there's an Evil Weasley (sub)plot (calling it a 'plot' might be too kind) and kill me now.
