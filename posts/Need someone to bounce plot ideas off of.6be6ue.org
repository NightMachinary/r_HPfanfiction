I'm looking for someone (or several someones) well-versed in the Potterverse. I'm outlining a series of fanfictions and I often find myself wishing I had someone to talk to about plot points, characterizations, etc. I'd like to find at least one female whom I can actually call on the phone so I can talk this out. Overall, I'd like about a dozen people whom I could message for discussion.

Please be warned, this is an extremely dark fic.


** Hey, I'm all for dark fics. I have, however, a sketchy schedule, so I'm not always available, but do use my mailbox and I'll reply as soon as possible. Also, I am a woman if it can help, but I will not use phone calls.

My only request is that I can also bounce ideas off of you for my own fic, if it's something of your interests.
