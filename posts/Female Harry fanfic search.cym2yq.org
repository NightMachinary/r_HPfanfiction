Hi all.

I was wondering what fanfics you can recommend of female Harry?

They can have any type of pairing and any theme.

Since I'd like to start reading thus type of fanfic, I obviously have no preferences in these fics.

Cheers.


** linkffn(A Long Journey Home by Rakeesh)

This gets recommended a lot but for good reason. The protagonist is a female Harry named Jasmine.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

** linkffn(Unbroken Saviour; Gryffindor's Girl; Intersecting Realities; Harry Potter et al and the Keystone Council; Victoria Potter; By Courage and Love by najex; Mistakes and Second Chances; Son of Potter Daughter of Black; 0800-rent-a-Hero; Swords and Sorcery)

- Unbroken Saviour is if you like timetravel combined with a lovable Dumbledore, though there's some grim aspects to this story.

- Gryffindor's Girl is in my opinion one of the best, if not THE best femHarry that stays as close to canon as possible, but being different enough that you'll never mistake for it. Its not a canon rehash by any stretch of the imagination.

- Intersecting realities is really fun and I wish there were more fics like that. Rent a Hero is pretty similar to it, but incomplete. Also fantastic, great use of Divination.

- Keystone has 2 different femHarry's, Marigold (she's actually one of Harry's twin) and Rose. There's 5 total Harry's across 5 different realities that have a mental link to one another. Its a fantastic read, where you get 5 different perspectives based on their different personalities. Nature x Nurture in some cases, with nice humor, some angst, and few cliches, surprisingly.

- Victoria Potter. Boy, this fic is a treat by our beloved [[/u/Taure]]. Imagine if you read HP for the first time, where you get that magical feel and everything is new and interesting, the world is fabulous and mystical, where there's always something else to understand about magic itself, without being repettitive like you get after a couple hundred fics in your system. This is it. Great character dev, no Bones cliche with her aunt, amazing world building, its funny, has so much depth to the story so far, the plot isn't shoved in your face. Overall, top tier fanfiction.

- By courage and Love is obviously an Eragon crossover, so if you haven't read the Inheritance Cycle, you'll be lost, unfortunately. I really doubt you'd get 100% of what's going on, though the author takes the time to explain shit, because Helena doesn't know what's going on. You could try though. Its based on another fic with the same premise, called Slowly and All at Once.

- Swords and Sorcery is another crossover, but with the Nasuverse. You really don't need much knowledge about it, its pretty self-explanatory, but if you've watched Fate/Stay Unlimited Blade Works, that's good enough. Even if you haven't you won't have much issues at all. The good thing about an anime crossover is that you can get the description for characters in images, so there's that.

- Mistakes is ok, with some heavy Dumbledore bashing early on, though it fizzles out aroung 60% in. Timetravel, femslash romance, Necromancy and Albumancy, some elemental magics based on both spectrums, some abuse, lots of angst, some rape, OP characters, lovable Snape, Politics. Not everyone's cup of tea. Its fairly enjoyable, at least for me it was.

- Son of Potter... I've read that a long time ago, so I may say something wrong or not remember at all. Sirius as a parent, pretty much, Harry is a metamorph that changes gender at will (after training) and eventually they make the change "permantly" to the society, though no one knows Harry is Melania(?) except their friends. Its enjoyable, lovable Sirius, Tonks is wonderfully funny, some angst. sadly its incomplete and hasn''t been updated in a long long time.

linkao3(Charred Paws and Heavy Coils)

- Its cute. there's some angst, but its really cute, Mamma Nagini.

  The summer after her fourth year is the worst one yet and Harry knows with grim certainty that her Uncle is going to kill her before she can even reach her fifteenth birthday. So she leaves. Finds herself by the edge of an forest - knows that no one is going to look for her out there.And she's content on her own - finds the rhythm of survival. Learns.She knows that the day she meets Nagini that she should have left. She's had dreams looking out from those exact slitted pupils - knows that she puts her life in danger every day she stays with Voldemort's familiar. But it's hard to be scared when Nagini huffs about her 'silly speaker' and complain about him working too hard and praises him for his toasty winter bed.But then, it's not Harry Potter who Tom meets that day in the clearing.It's Nagini's 'Little Wolf' - and that changes everything.

*** I never thought I'd enjoy a fem!Harry fic but this series is pretty much my favourite ever. Although Harry/Rigel is a completely different character from canon I love her so much, and I feel it's pretty well-written and a lot of the magical theory is well thought-out and explained which I like!

**** It's more like a parent who went through trauma and is trying to make things right, but is neglecting his daughter in order to achieve his goal of a better world. Paired with I'll advice from people he believes he can trust in.

I was the neglected child. My brother had a bad accident when I was young, almost died and our parents did everything for him, sadly they forgot that I was there too and my brother almost died. So I understand how it works and feels. And I think this story has some of the psychological aspects it needs to feel relatable.

** Definitely Laventadorn's "The Never Ending Road" series. Really wonderful characterization and flow of the story. It's on hiatus for now I believe, so currently it's pretty general. I can't recommend this one enough, I'm getting a tattoo from the series next month. :)

  AU. When Lily died, Snape removed his heart and replaced it with a steel trap. But rescuing her daughter from the Dursleys in the summer of '92 is the first step on a long road to discovering this is less true than he'd thought. A girl!Harry story, starting in Chamber of Secrets and continuing through Goblet of Fire. Future Snape/Harriet. (OotP - DH will continue in a separate story.)
