Nine scenes in which Harry should definitely have died but then didn't; Voldemort in 81, fighting Quirrelmort, Basilisk, Dementors, Voldemort in the graveyard, A falling piece of masonry, etc. And then we discover that Lilly's amazing magic was to sacrifice a kneazel to give Harry nine lives. No master of death shenanigans at all. Bonus: Harry turns into a cat frequently and no one notices.
