Hey Guys and Gals. I have been searching for this fanfic for ages now, so if someone could please help me, I would be so grateful! It's s Harry Potter fanfic that I read on FanFiction.net. It started with Harry at the Dursley's and he starts to realize that Dumbledore doesn't have his best interests at heart. Somehow he contacts the goblins and Bill Weasley who help him with stuff which leads to a confrontation with all the order members, where Dumbledore is on one side and Harry on the other and people are picking sides. The Weasley's choose Harry. Harry , Ron and Ginny find out Hermione has been spying on them for Dumbledore and they break off their friendship. Harry and Luna date but the romance is very minor and Luna dies at the end. At some point Snape is at Grimmauld Place and kills Lupin, Molly and Arthur. Harry and the rest of the Weasleys kill him after exposing that he deceived Dumbledore into thinking he was good. Dumbledore steps down as Leader of the Order of the Phoenix and Bill Weasley becomes the new leader and the Order now works with Harry and his friends. At some point Colin Creevey asks Hernione out.

That's all I remember. I'm hoping someone can help me!


** It's probably Harry Potter and the Final Straw by bellerophon30, but it's been removed from ffn. [[http://fanfics.me/read2.php?id=58217][This is the only copy I could find.]]
