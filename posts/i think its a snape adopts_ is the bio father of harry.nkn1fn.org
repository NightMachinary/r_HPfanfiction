i remember harry being quite young (pre hogwarts) around preschool/kindergarten age and he takes the subway with snape and they meet hermione and her mum on the train and she is wearing gumboots or wellingtons like harry and they talk and end up swapping gumboots without snape or ms granger noticing. i think harry and hermione end up in the same class at primary school.

thanks so much!


** I remember this exact scene in a fic, but it was one where Sirius adopted little Harry.
