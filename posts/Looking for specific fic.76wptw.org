It's pretty cracky.

Harry comes to the wizarding world and decides to treat it like a video game, or fantasy story. Something like that.

This somehow translates into him going into Knockturn Alley and finding a magical creature slave trafficking den. He.. somehow.. sets them all free and they become his friends.

There's some sort of spider-girl. She is mostly human but has too many arms, and can web-sling like Spider-Man. Apparently, she gives really good hugs. He goes about registering her as his famililar so that she can attend Hogwarts with him.

That's about all I remember.

Anybody know what fic I'm talking about?

  Harry is sure he's living in a fairy tale with himself as the hero. Really, what else makes sense?

  The summer before his fifth year, Harry obtains a computer and an internet connection. Two months later, he emerges a changed person, for what has been seen cannot be unseen. AU with the whole Harry Potter timeline moved forward to the modern day. References to internet memes, video games, anime, etc.

  Harry Potter catches Voldemort's AK to the noggin only to find out that his life is a video game and he forgot to save. So what does he do? Does he return on Hard mode and work for the challenge? Heck No! Harry uses every exploit, grind, or underhanded tactic he can get his hands on. His life may be a video game, but nobody plays Harry Potter; Harry's going to exploit the system.
