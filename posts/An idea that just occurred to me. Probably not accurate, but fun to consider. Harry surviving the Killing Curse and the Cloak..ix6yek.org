What if it wasn't his mother's sacrifice that saved him, but the Cloak itself?

I'm imagining that the Cloak automatically passes itself down to the first born, and on that fateful Halloween, Harry was already master of the Cloak, which had already abandoned James for its new master, no matter that it wasn't in his possession at the time. The Cloak makes you invisible, yes, but it also hides its master from Death.

The only reason the curse hit him in the Forbidden Forest is that he /took it off/ with intent to face Death.


** This is actually a really cool idea!!

** What I see with this is that James still retained ownership of the cloak after Harry was born. The cloak is said to keep Death from seeing wielder of it. The reason that James was able to be killed by Voldemort was that he had willingly given the cloak to Dumbledore, thereby passing the ownership of the cloak to Harry at that point. As Harry was a baby and therefore unable to willingly give permission for Dumbledore to have the cloak, it was still his, and thus he was protected from the killing curse. As someone else stated, the reason the killing curse affected him in forest, was because he willingly gave up its protection, when going to face Voldemort.

*** Because as Death's Cloak, it exists beyond the physical plane, its magic is merged with Harry's until his son is born or he relinquishes it to face Death.

** I would agree with you but we need a little more context than Voldemort's account of the events. If James truly sacrificed himself for Harry and Lily and not just caught by surprise, it meant that he "greeted death like an old friend"... so it means that the possession of the cloak went by default to Harry and thus he was immune to all those deadly situations until he was willing to accept death. In addition, Lily's sacrifice protected him from Voldemort's touch. So in fact it would be a pretty cool idea if both parents' sacrifice worked as a protection.

*** "lily take harry and run'' James shouted as ran to the couch to pick up his wand he looked at and sighed sadly "its the end of our adventures together old friend'' James stood up tall and faced the front door with a soft determination on his face 'lets do house potter proud''

James potter will later be found dead with a mile on his face. the smile of a man who faced evil knowing he could never win and yet he fought with such ferocity and tenacity a unknowing onlooker would have been conviced he was the superior fighter.

James potter stared death down and raged against it not for his own life but for the life of his wife and son.

Magic is a funny thing, as it turns out james potter was in possion of a special cloak that protected the master from some harm. Generally, the magic of the cloak was subtle it would protect against scratchs and nicks and small sicknessess but under certain conditions the magic of the cloak would be enhanced to extrordinary levels. The cloak was normally merely a very unique invisibility cloak with a few quirks that make it stand out amongst the others.

but tonight James potter actived some very special magic in the cloak for when a member of house potter willingly faces an early death to protect another member of house potter. the magic of the cloak would enhance and the next head of house potter would be immune to even the most evil of magic for a time.

*** I don't think it would protect him from dying of physical injury, but the Killing Curse, which causes no other damage to the body normally, is blocked by the cloak.

You see, with other causes of death, the body is no longer capable of functioning. With the Killing Curse, as far as I'm aware, everything just... stops.

*** Certainly makes more sense than Lily's sacrifice.. You'd think there'd be previous records of people surviving the killing curse, thanks to the willing self-sacrifice of others, but no, that's not the case. Harry is the only one, and much ado is made for the fact Harry is the only one to survive the killing curse.

However, the Cloak, to my knowledge, is unique, thus could potentially contribute to the unique circumstances that results in one surviving when struck by the killing curse.
