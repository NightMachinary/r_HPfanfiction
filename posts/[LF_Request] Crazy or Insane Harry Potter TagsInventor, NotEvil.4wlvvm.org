  Harry Potter wasn't raised like in canon. He was top of his class, and very intelligent, always seeking to improve things, and so he learned all kinds of things, and, upon entering Hogwarts, started studying all he could get his hands on! Intelligent!Super!Harry Later Mad Scientist!Harry Rated M for Language, Nudity, and Gore Stein-ish Harry Genres: Humor/Romance/slight Horror

** linkffn(The Art of Self-Fashioning)

This one got a pretty insane Harry going for it. He is a Transfiguration prodigy and tries to heal his parents (Neville's and his fates are exchanged) with Transfiguration. He becomes rather ruthless eventually, which is also the part of the story where it all begins to drag on a bit.

** Rebuilt by Terrific_Lunacy linkao3(2702009)

It's a non magic AU with hp/tmr. Before you dismiss it you should read the summary and know that the M content appears only twice and both have warnings before them. It's actually one of the least smutty smut that I have ever come across. The plot has been so well thought out, it's amazing. Harry is most definitely a genius, crazy inventor, it's like his thing.

Young Harry Potter tries to stay out of trouble, but when a new lord with unconventional ideas sees the potential in his unique talents, his quiet life soon gets turned upside down.Armed only with his wits, Harry has to take on one catastrophe after the other, all the while trying to uncover his own past and teach a certain smug bastard the meaning of personal space.
