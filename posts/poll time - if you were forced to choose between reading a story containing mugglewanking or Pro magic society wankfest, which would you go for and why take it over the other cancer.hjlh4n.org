I'll go first. i hate both like most of you but I'll go for the second option because 99% of mugglewank is predictable. somehow it's always about getting guns and the Death eaters are no more you backward stone age society, you're welcome /harry puts shades on to finish off his tactical combat army outfit/ on the other hand the other type of the fics can sometime surprise me with a new Concept of they go into details into their own world building and such things like rituals and other stuff. so yeah lemme know your own takes


** For the record, this is the first time I've ever heard about mugglewank. That being said, I prefer Wizard.

We live in the Muggle World. Hell, that IS the world. I won't pretend to know everything about our world, because I refuse to be that arrogant, but I do know enough to be, in equal parts, bored and horrified by it. When I read a story about a world with MAGIC, the last thing I care about is the part of the story which explicitly does NOT HAVE MAGIC. I want to read about magical healing, magical husbandry, hell, if someone would write it, I'd read about Harry founding a magical haberdashery!

** I'll take wizardwank because a number of the wizardwank stories I've read have actually made interesting plot and character developments. The worst of them are merely forgettable for being mediocre.

Meanwhile, Mugglewank honestly needs to go to lengths to justify the conflict in the first place, and also ends up feeling like 2012 [[/r/atheism]] an annoying amount of the time.

** Magic wankfest, because word of God says magic always surpass the mundane. I mean, yeah, the concept of a firearm is nifty and could be enhanced by enchantments to be /relevant/ in the wizarding world. Magic wankfest, in my experience, is almost a guarantee the author actually comprehends the world they're writing about and did research about what magic in the Potterverse can do. The wizarding world, in regards to humans exclusively, is a hundred times better than the Muggle world due to its better living conditions, it's lack of sexism/homophobia/racism, its hundredfolds better medical treatments and it's actually a post-scarcity society.

And because they have better clothes in my opinion. But you know, who can decide between defying every rule of physic and clothes?

*** I wouldn't exactly call the wizarding world post-scarcity, especially as there is scarcity of /magical/ goods and services. But it's certainly true that the Weasleys, despite being considered poor within the wizarding world, have a large house, own a lot of land, and eat like kings.

** Wizardwank, because:

1. Wizardwank is canon (which is not to say that canonical wizards are /morally/ superior to Muggles).

2. I read HP because I enjoy imagining myself as a wizard; why would I nerf myself?

** Wizardwank, at least it can vary and the authors invent or show some new magic and/or apply concepts JKR couldn't explore too much, like rituals and blood magic. And unless you do surprise attacks, killing wizards with guns is kinda hard, because an adult one can just turn the gun into a rat, or shield against the bullets, and the turn the /shooter/ into a rat.

Mugglewank is always the same of 'duh, guns!', kids doing guerilla warfare, a Hermione wankfest, and wizards being dumb.

The same way I think Wizards shouldn't colonize the mundane world, I don't think the mundane should colonize the wizards' either.

'But wizards are misanthropes!', only if you AU that, Wizarding society is WAY ahead of ours on gender and race issues, at least the ones not involving blood purity, that has more to do with xenophobia and maybe social class than anything.

AND their lower class is way better than ours, the Weasleys are considered poor yet they all go to a good school, their kids managed to get good jobs and we never hear of them going hungry.

** I prefer the Wizardwank, partly for your own reasons but also because I read Harry Potter for the magic.

Edit: Dammit I can't leave it there. The reason I loved the books so much was the world. The world was rich, and detailed, and I always wanted to know more about the world itself, rather than the adventures of Harry and friends. It's why I read fanfic at all.

As for the mugglewank, you're right, the vast majority of it is absolutely dependent on wizards being drooling idiots. How about an actual examination of wizarding culture, beliefs, society etc? Nah, they're just backwards idiots and must be colonized. For their own good of course, since we are better than them.

I dislike the idea of anyone just showing up to a completely different culture and trying to impose their will on it, no matter how backwards you think they may be. History has enough of that sort of thing, don't try to justify it with your perceived moral superiority.

Its the same with the house elf debate, why does nobody ever consider the house elves themselves? How does house elf society work? They must have their own culture, beliefs, history etc. Wouldn't that be a fascinating read? But no, an entire species of non human sentient beings reduced to a vessel for you own political views.

Sorry if I ranted a bit there, so yeah, wizardwank.

** Mugglewank, because if forced to choose I'll side with the oppressed over the oppressors.

The problem with that though is that Mugglewank stories tend to harp on about how enlightened the (Western) Muggle world is compared to the backwards wizards, and how we would totally never do stuff like detain people without trial, enslave people, etc, which means they tacitly or explicitly whitewash real world atrocities by holding the Muggle world up as a model of enlightenment compared to wizards.
