The magical people in HP universe have a power to impose their will onto the surrounding world. That much has been established, however, the books didn't do much to explain the workings. It was implied, that the incantations, along with wand movements are needed to perform the spells. Why?

*I. About the magic, in general.*

The way I see it, it is different. Yes, incantations and wand movements are part of it, but, first of all, it's quite obvious, that magic came long before wands did. Since the mages already have the power (the potential), they need the will to use it. And thus, what magic usage comes to, essentially, is intention.

A wizard/witch needs to focus on a particular goal, and will it to happen. Incantations are not necessary, but they help the focus. What are words, after all, if not the verbal representation of our thoughts and intentions?

​

Of course, a question arises here - how, in that case, did Harry manage to cast Levicorpus and Sectumsempra in his 6th year? He had no idea what either spell did.

And this brings me to the second part of my theory about magic, which branches into two separate theories, both of which are tied to inheritance.

1. Even though Harry himself did not understand the latin words, his distant ancestors very likely did. After all, Latin was very widespread (at least in Europe) at some point. And through inheritance, he is able to, at least subconsciously, get the meaning of the word.
2. Magic itself understands words. Not only does it understand the intention through the words, but the meaning of the words themselves. And through inheritance, a person's magic gets knowledge of the languages spoken long ago.

Both of these come to the same conclusion:

Harry was in the heat of battle, and his opponent was about to use an Unforgiveable on him. The situation was dire, and all Harry could do was attack. His intention, thus, was to harm his opponent, and through the uttered words /Sectum/ (cut) /sempra/ (always), he instructed exactly HOW his magic should do it.

It's the same with Levicorpus - the intention was to stop and punish an opponent, and the words told exactly how to do it.

​

And thus, it is not the words themselves, that carry power. It's the wizard/witch. However, words merely represent what the wizard/witch wants to do.

​

*II. About the wands.*

I already mentioned the obvious - the wands must have come long after magic (and mages) appeared. And thus, a wand is not necessary to cast spells, but it still is useful, and needed in some cases.

Wands are needed to concentrate the user's magic to a point and direct it during the firing. It is possible to do both without a wand, however not to the same extent:

When shooting a spell from, say, a palm, a large amount of the spell's power will be wasted, as it will disperse into the air around (not concentrated enough). Also, it will not be accurate, as aiming with a palm is far harder, than using a wand.

​

Also, about the wand movements - they are needed to specify /how/ a spell will be used. Some spells are fired as a missile, others have no projectile at all, third ones can even be fired as a stream (i.e. Aquamenti). The wand movement specifies this, among other things.


** why are you putting spoiler tags for a book that's been out for 14 years in a subreddit dedicated to fanfiction about it lmao

One issue with your theory is that if someone like Parvati were to try and use Levicorpus like Harry did (without knowing what it did or anything about it) it wouldn't work, because her ancestors probably didn't speak Latin. And if the inheritance of the language was necessary to learn Latin-based magic, people of non-European origin would be at a disadvantage if they were learning in Europe.

And Harry didn't have any intent when he used Levicorpus on Ron. He just waved his wand and nonverbally cast the spell.

*** Indeed, if Parvati tried to use it, it might not work at all, or work slightly differently. But we've never read/seen canon going against this, so technically, it's not wrong :P

They could still learn the meaning of the Latin words currently used. They would be disadvantaged, however, in case they happened upon a spell they did not know anything about, except for incantation (like Harry with Sectumsempra).

At the same time, it was said in canon, that every region has it's own magical culture, and it's own magical schools. Very likely, foreign students could cast magic of the ancient languages of their own regions.

And why did Harry cast the spell? To protect himself, to stop Ron from attacking. As I mentioned in the post. That is the intent.

** I have like a 10 page theory of how magic works (along with a fair bit of history to flesh it out a bit) written down on loose paper somewhere. I'll drop it in its own post when I have it out next for everyone else to gawk at the lovingly over complicated mess I ended up with.

That said, this shares a lot with both my own headcanon and other theories I've seen elsewhere.

** That goes well with my theory:

Basically, spells and spell-effects are analogous to enzymes - they are really complex things made of a bunch of small magic monomers, arranged in a particular shape.

Humans evolved a powerful telekinesis ability (note that most if not all of the accidental magics and wandless magics we see in canon can be interpreted as that, or are Mind Magics) alongside our powerful minds.

As such, we learned how to use that to take our natural magical enzymes, rip them apart, and rearrange them arbitrarily. This is exceedingly complex and finicky, hence why most ancient magics took a long time to cast, or were done via rituals, or involved many people.

Wands make that process much faster, easier, and more consistent, by drawing out the exact monomer from the witch or wizard by their desire.

The wand movements are to facilitate proper arrangement of the monomers - they can be dropped as one gets more experienced at directly manipulating them directly (although it will always be somewhat less efficient).

The spell-words serve the same purpose as the ancient chants and rituals - the early magical training associates specific monomers with specific sounds.

The spell-words are much shorter, because in combination with however wands work, there are more ways to make sounds than there are monomers, so a lot of common large blocks of monomers have their own sound-associations, and through centuries of development and honing, most common purposes have relatively short chains of sounds that perform them.

In short, a given spell has a one-to-one mapping into a kind of [programming] pseudocode that together with the placement of the monomers determines the spell.

Intent is important because a large portion of the above ends up being instinctual, and other reasons.

Emotion-powered spells are so because they require magical monomers that the body only produces in sufficient quantities when in that emotional state.

** Seems a bit poorly thought out. Much of it is already pervasive fanon, and some is even commonly accepted, but some of your conclusions are just strange.

For example, you stress the importance of intention over words

> Incantations are not necessary, but they help the focus. What are words, after all, if not the verbal representation of our thoughts and intentions?

But, and hear me out here, if that was the case you wouldn't need incantations. You would say "fire" to light stuff on fire, not "incendio". You wouldn't say "wingardium leviosa", you would order stuff to fly or levitate and it would. If words were only needed to focus, incantations wouldn't be in dead languages.

​

> And this brings me to the second part of my theory about magic, which branches into two separate theories, both of which are tied to inheritance.

Why though? There is nothing anywhere tying magic to 'inheritance'.

> Even though Harry himself did not understand the latin words, his distant ancestors very likely did. After all, Latin was very widespread (at least in Europe) at some point. And through inheritance, he is able to, at least subconsciously, get the meaning of the word.

Hahaha, no. Sorry, but people don't have a genetic dictionary that tells them what words mean. If that was the case, we wouldn't have such trouble deciphering dead languages.

> Magic itself understands words. Not only does it understand the intention through the words, but the meaning of the words themselves. And through inheritance, a person's magic gets knowledge of the languages spoken long ago.

This isn't a new idea, having magic be some kind of semi-sentient ethereal thing that functions like a computer, in an input-output kind of process. But tying it to inheritance, again, why? Most go for an omniscient and omnipresent layer, or an archive à la Akashic Records. The idea that what, it only knows about language spoken by ancient people so that you can justify wizards speaking pseudo-Latin? It's just half-baked.

> Both of these come to the same conclusion

They don't really, you had ONE idea and wanted to think ways it could fit in with the wizarding world, ignoring most evidence that disprove it. I bet the conclusion came before these theories.

Because if that was the case, if magic is intent and words are just a focus, there would be no need to learn spells. After all, let's say I need to make water - there is a charm for that, Aguamenti. But under your system, I would think very hard of making water, say a couple words in shitty Latin - Acquam Creo or whatever - and I would be set. After all I have the intent of creating water, and magic knows my ancestors spoke Latin at some point, which means I don't need to study useless things like charms anymore.

> And thus, it is not the words themselves, that carry power. It's the wizard/witch. However, words merely represent what the wizard/witch wants to do.

So the wizard Baruffio, in his heart of hearts, really just wanted a buffalo, and his intent coupled with his genetic knowledge of ancient languages conspired to give him one.

> Wands are needed to concentrate the user's magic to a point and direct it during the firing. It is possible to do both without a wand, however not to the same extent:

This is mostly fanon. There is no pool of energy or MP or whatever. We don't know what kind of effect wands have on the abilities of a spellcaster, but I woud think 'wasting the spell's power' is not among these. Power dispersing into the air is also not a concern.

Basically, magic in Harry Potter does not work like Chakra from Naruto or whatever.

You are correct. It wouldn't necessarily require the latin words. But the point is, that we saw Severus Snape create spells. We know, thus, that it's not just the ancient incantations, that work. The power is not in the incantation, in other words. Also, take in mind the Stunning Spell - "stupefy" is an English word.

The entire point of mine, is that the books hint towards it not being the words, that carry power, but rather, the person himself/herself.

I brought up inheritance specifically to explain why, despite the wizard's/witch'es intention and will carrying the power, it's still possible to use spells one has no knowledge of, apart from the incantation.

No, I specifically did NOT make the magic itself sentient, semi, or not. However, it is able to hold information. Every person's magic is different, but it is tied, distantly to that of their parents', grandparents', and other ancestors, all the way to their ancient ancestors, who (in case of Harry Potter) very likely spoke Latin. Thus, Harry's own magic is aware of the words, and can react to them. That was my theory.

Most spells have been created in Latin. It just happened so, and the Ministry did not bother to change them. If anything, it makes a Ministry's job easier to have an organized system of known incantations. Creating new spells (as hinted by the books) was a rarity in Harry's times. But it was still possible.

And isn't that exactly what kids already do, when they use accidental magic? It's canon. As for the studies, and their apparent redundancy - a fair point.

However, at the same time, it is officially said, already, that wizards/witches technically don't even need to pass Hogwarts to use magic. A magical school is there to help them control their magic.

Also, intention and will were always needed for magic, and were always being taught in Hogwarts. Remember Apparition training? Remember how Moody talked about students not being able to use Unforgiveables properly, for lack of will?

The way I see it, a school teaches mages to achieve the state of mind needed for voluntary spell casting in general, and then, to cast individual spells. For example, casting Patronus requires a completely different state of mind than, say, casting Crucio.

Regardless, this is a fair point from you, and I'd need further time to think over this.

#+begin_quote
  " This is mostly fanon. "

And I never claimed otherwise. I am merely creating a theory, that could explain the magic usage in canon.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Well, I do think it's a concern. Using a wand vs. using a palm to shoot spells is the same as using a gun vs. throwing bullets at your opponent. Well, not exactly, as wandless magic is still effective, but the point is, that the same accuracy is impossible.

And it's very likely, that there may also exist a sort of "power leakage", where part of the energy used for the spell does not even reach the target, rather missing, or dispersing altogether. Thus, the spellcasting is not 100% efficient, energy-wise. Less so, when done without a wand.

#+begin_quote
  " Basically, magic in Harry Potter does not work like Chakra from Naruto or whatever. "

Never implied it does. And I doubt "Naruto" has anything like this.

Yes, obviously it's not just the words that have power or there wouldn't be squibs and muggles.

The word 'stupefy' comes from the Latin verb 'stupefacere', so it's a pretty poor example.

> I brought up inheritance specifically to explain why, despite the wizard's/witch'es intention and will carrying the power, it's still possible to use spells one has no knowledge of, apart from the incantation.

But why inheritance then, instead of a miriad other options? It could very well be that wizards ritualistically etch spells into the very fabric of the universe, just pulling inheritance as a possible explanation without any proof doesn't make it a good option.

> I was not talking about real world. I believe that is quite obvious. And who's there to say this isn't possible in a magical one?

Of course it's possible in an imaginary world, but the question we should be asking is: "Is this a thing in Harry Potter?", and the answer, guess what, is probably no.

> No, I specifically did NOT make the magic itself sentient, semi, or not. However, it is able to hold information. Every person's magic is different, but it is tied, distantly to that of their parents', grandparents', and other ancestors, all the way to their ancient ancestors, who (in case of Harry Potter) very likely spoke Latin. Thus, Harry's own magic is aware of the words, and can react to them. That was my theory.

But then, what about the muggleborns? Their parents don't have magic, does the line start with them? How far back does it even go, and why Latin specifically instead of a proto-indoeuropean language then?

> Most spells have been created in Latin. It just happened so, and the Ministry did not bother to change them. If anything, it makes a Ministry's job easier to have an organized system of known incantations. Creating new spells (as hinted by the books) was a rarity in Harry's times. But it was still possible.

"It just happened so" is a pretty poor explanation. A better one could be that roman wizards were the ones to popularize the wand based will+word casting type, that gradually supplanted more primitive types of foci.

Why would the Ministry be the authority on changing magic? They were founded in the 1700s, Hogwarts would have been a much greater influence on what kind of magic people knew throughout the United Kingdom. The world, even, if British wizards spread with the English Empire.

Creating new spells is a rarity, probably, because there isn't a need for it anymore. There is a charm for anything one may want to do, so there is no need to create new ones. And organized system, what system are you even talking about?

> And isn't that exactly what kids already do, when they use accidental magic? It's canon. As for the studies, and their apparent redundancy - a fair point.

No, it's what Tom Riddle did. We literally have only one example of a ten years old kid having a grasp on his magic, and it's the one that's in the top three of the century. And if controlling accidental magic was as easy as you make it out to be, pureblood wizards would definitely have a much better grasp of it, but we don't see Malfoy do anything like that, do we?

> However, at the same time, it is officially said, already, that wizards/witches technically don't even need to pass Hogwarts to use magic. A magical school is there to help them control their magic.

That's like saying, I don't need to go to school to do math. Sure it's true, but you're missing the point of a school. They exist so that people share knowledge, so that everyone has a leg up.

> Also, intention and will were always needed for magic, and were always being taught in Hogwarts. Remember Apparition training? Remember how Moody talked about students not being able to use Unforgiveables properly, for lack of will?

And, fair enough, intent should be an important component. But it can't be the only important thing, or the whole system crumbles.

My point is, energy efficiency is not a concern for wizards because they aren't bound by a limited mana pool. They don't get tired from casting spells, there is no inherent quality to them that makes one wizard more magical than the other. Instead of efficiency, think skill - it's like playing a piano, and using a wand is playing with two hands instead of one. You can play Fur Elise with one hand, you could even be so good at it that you could play both hands with only one, but using two hands is inherently easier than using only one. So the reason people don't use wandless magic is, simply, because using a wand is easier. It requires less concentration, less practice, less effort in general. People naturally tend towards laziness in their lives, so any evolution of a wide magical system should be towards ease of use.
