So, we're inching toward the end of the year, bit by bit, and I'm sure everybody's going mad with the Christmas decorations abruptly appearing everywhere even though it's still November!

Let's have a positive talk - in the American Thanksgiving spirit, what have been your favourite reviews of the year? Have any been especially inspirational to you, or have any reviewers really spurred you on or given you great ideas?

Have you had any very funny reviews, or even especially stupid ones? Which have been at the top of your list?


** This has actually been a year for some really wonderful reviews from generous readers, all for the same many-years-old story. It's the only fic I've ever written that's even moderately popular, and people seemed to stumble across it for some reason this year.

One reviewer said she'd read the story three times since I first posted it. She'd just spent several weeks watching a relative die and had come home from the memorial service and read it again, and it helped provide a degree of catharsis for her. There's something special about touching a reader in a way that genuinely affects their lives, and it was very kind of her to open a comment box and share that with me.

** Well I thought I'd only had three reviews this year, but on looking I've actually had about seven of which one was possibly the worst, most crushing review I've had. But this one was the best of the year and made my day.

  Hey, I just finished reading your story. I liked Sirius ever since I read the third Harry-Potter-book for the very first time, but I guess I was just too young to realise his strong and interesting character the way I do today. When I saw Gary Oldman on screen as Sirius Black, I was somehow disappointed. Don't get me wrong, I really like Oldman as an actor, but ... well ... not in this particular role. I always thought that Sirius' appearance would somehow match Jack Sparrow and Oldman was just not mysterious enough ;-) Anyway, I was pleased to find a story that deals with the older and much darker Sirius that suffered those years in Azcaban and tries to find his way back to life. Julia is a lovely person and I liked the development of their relationship. I was also impressed by the complexity of the story you built around them. But I have to admit, that I silently begged for you not to follow the destiny which hunts Sirius in the books. Therefore, it was quite hard to read through the last chapters and I felt like crying when Dumbledore was forced to take Julia's memories of Sirius from her. But, never the less, I liked your story, your characters and your way of writing a lot! Thanks for sharing this and have a nice day!

** I wrote two one-shots so far, both marked as complete. And yet I got a ton of "a great start"/"waiting for the next chapter" reviews. I guess it is due to the fact that both are snippets and with an open ending but still, it is marked complete for a reason. One is 9k words long and a complete arc for fuck's sake. I started writing the second chapter for one of them but things are going slowly because I fail to capture the same "spirit" of lightheartedness since I never expected to continue that particular plot and had to scrap a couple drafts.
