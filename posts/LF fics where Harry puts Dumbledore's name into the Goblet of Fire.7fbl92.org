*** Don't be dense. If he didn't force Harry into the tourney how in the name of Merman could he have resurrected his imperiused patsy Voldemort in a suitably showy manner to act as a fall guy when Dumbledore the Great finally enacts his bloody revenge on those filthy muggles?

That doesn't sound like he loved the idea to me. That sounds like doing whatever he can to make sure that Harry doesn't get murdered by a vengeful Death Eater.

Everybody knows that a basilisk's gaze kills. That it petrifies when seen indirectly is either completely unknown or an obscure factoid that not even Dumbledore would know off the top of their head.

Sounds like you're saying that Dumbledore didn't do it because Harry wouldn't want him to.

  In his dreams Harry discovered Voldemort was going to attempt to get him into the TriWizard Tournament. In retaliation he tricked the Goblet of Fire to emit the names of the people who wanted him in the tournament. Four names came out, including Albus Dumbledore. Now the new Supreme Champion is forced into the tournament. See how he fares. Dumbledore!Bashing.

** Not Dumbledore, but in linkffn(Weres Harry) He places his own ward line to make Draco's name come out, as well as being paid by several Durmstrang students to improve their chances. (End result, NINE Champions, and the only thing Albus can do about it is force Harry to act as Master of Ceremonies and host because he couldn't prove it was Harry.)

  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.
