We all have those tropes that we just can't stand, but sometimes we amazingly find a story with said trope and we surprisingly enough end up loving it.

So, what are those tropes and stories for you?

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) with non-permanent Transfiguration. Rather than just a misunderstanding of canon like it often is, the story makes it work as a central element of the AU, and it all ties very nicely into the rest of the lore (for instance, the Philosopher's Stone). The stories has flaws otherwise, but were I to hate it for something, it would /not/ be for the Transfiguration.

Also, obligatory linkffn(Core Threads) for magical cores.

***** There are a lot of people who find Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres just plain obnoxious, and unlikable as a result. Which can't really be helped. What /could/ be helped is the less defendable assumption that Harry being an obnoxious jerk translates to the /author/ being an obnoxious jerks --- a lot of people think the story is a (terrible) self-insert.

Then of course, there's the people who think the AUness is either offensive to canon, or an excuse for the author not doing the research because he's lazy. I... won't dignify /that/ with an answer.

And finally, there's the people who disagree with the philosophical arguments in the story (mostly the praise of rationality above all else, and the thorough anti-death stance), and just can't like the story because of it.
