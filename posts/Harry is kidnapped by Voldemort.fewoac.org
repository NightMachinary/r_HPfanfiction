:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So, I'm looking for a fic where a younger Harry is kidnapped by Voldemort and he attempts to raise the kid in a relatively comfortable but locked room in hopes of Stockholm Syndrome kicking in. I vaguely recall something about Harry being interesting or a challenge or something to him? Harry's parents are alive and very concerned about their kid being missing. Harry is very calm and unfazed by being kidnapped and more mature than a young child should be and escapes at some point while Voldemort is out. The adults are intermittently suspicious of him escaping and being so well-maintained after the experience.

I don't remember anything else from the fic, just that kidnapping sequence. Could be a time travel fic, could be a Slytherin!Harry fic, could be anything. I don't know.

Harry is calm/mature about the kidknapping because, as Master of Death, he has been reincarnated so many times that not much can phase him.

  HPLV. Harry Potter has been reborn again and again into new bodies as the Master of Death---but he has always helped to defeat Voldemort in each new world. Now his slightly older brother is the target of the prophecy, and Harry assumes his role is to support Jonathan. At least, that's what he thinks until Voldemort kidnaps him that Halloween night.

*** I don't think so? There's not enough around the Harry being 'kidnapped' bit to be what I was thinking. And I recall the interaction between the two being more hostile - lots less "Yay, Voldemort adopted me" sort of vibes and more "Oh, the arse is still talking. Saying interesting things, but still an arse." vibes in what I'm thinking of.
