Good, well written fics that aren't TOO far different from the normal canon, I mostly read AU with Harry in Slytherin or Neville as the BWL. Not too interested in the type of fics where Harry has all these super crazy powers, but sill really take whatever you think is good lol.


** I think you will like these canon divergent fics:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9095016/1/][Betrayal]], linkffn(9095016): Both Ron and Hermione left Harry in the tent. They are soon captured and murdered. Harry has waged an one man war for several years until he freed Daphne Greengrass.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11916243/1/][Escape]], linkffn(11916243): In year 6, Harry and Hermione run from a marriage law and cleverly direct the war from behind the scene.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929): Canon compliant until the end of HBP, when Grindelwald breaks out to help Harry fight Voldemort. Together they spread chaos and revolutions across Europe.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106): Most popular fic on this sub by a wide margin. Here, Voldemort's soul took over or merged with Harry on that Halloween night. He decides to pursue a different goal this time, chaos and hilarity ensue. Interestingly, most canon stations are still visited, although with significantly different outcome each time.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925): Canon compliant up to the Wedding, then things go ugly. More than two years later during a mission, badly traumatized Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Neville are thrown into a new dimension where things have gone rather differently.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): After the War, Harry and his friends finally had it enough, as they declared war on the incorrigible Ministry and Wizengamot. They began with vigilante killings of Death Eaters who had escaped justice again.

  Winner of the DLP February 2013 Apocalyptic/Dystopian Fiction Contest! Attempting to hold the trio together, Hermione grabs Ron just before he Apparates, accidentally abandoning Harry on the Horcrux hunt. Four years later, Harry is a changed man.

  AU. A marriage law is instigated during Hermione's sixth year. Hermione considers her options and makes her choice, it just wasn't the one they were expecting. By saving herself Hermione's decisions cause ripples to run through the Order. The game has changed, those left behind need to adapt to survive. Canon up to the HBP, Dumbledore lives, Horcrux are still in play

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...

  Harry Potter grew up at Number Four Privet Drive. Harry Potter has never known his parents. Harry Potter is a wizard.Harry Potter is not the Boy Who Lived.--The Thrown Pebble is Book One of a whole-canon reimagining wherein Neville Longbottom, not Harry Potter, was the one targeted by Voldemort. This changes many things, and other things not at all.(TTP is complete; the series is a WIP. Tags will be updated as chapters are posted. See series notes for more details.)
