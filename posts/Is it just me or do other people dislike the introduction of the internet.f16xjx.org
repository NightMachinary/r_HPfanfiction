The hp series takes place before the internet was invented, or at the very least when it is in its infancy. I cannot help but believe that wizarding society would be able to come up with an alternative to the web.


** I just feel like a major part of the charm of the world for me is this separation from technology. I can often agree with the logic of fics introducing certain tech equivalents but it always seems to lose some of the timeless magic for me.

** The fact that there's no Internet in HP is precisely the reason why I love the series. Every now and then someone asks oh why didn't they use pens/computers and so on. And every time I feel like asking why on earth is that such a problem? I use the Internet and so have no desire to have to read about it. The series is timeless and that's how I like it. There's this odd need to make wizards use everything we use. I get it's interesting on some level, but judging by the questions people ask, it feels as if they think wizards absolutely have to use iphones and computers. It's almost like they want to cure the wizarding world of some disease. So now it's phones and the Internet, and every new generation will want to add something more. Maybe wizards are fine without those things. What they do need, I think, is a spell to find the information they need quickly without having to read large volumes all night like Harry did in GoF.

** Depends:

1. Internet was not widespread when the Series took place, so I immediately close out any fic that has its characters using things like iPhone or Google. But in a war, I do expect combatants to use every advantage they can get, and that means it's absolutely reasonable for Muggelborns to use emails to communicate with each other, like in "Divided and Entwined".
2. Postwar, it should be expected that more open-minded members of the Wizarding world would look at Internet and think about adopting this technology, *just like they had adopted cars, cameras, radios, and trains before*. The Hogwarts Express is after all a successful example. In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12925628/1/Interview-with-Director-Potter][my own one shot]], linkffn(12925628), I have this:

  HJP: Actually, the concept came from a Muggle invention called the Internet. The Muggles have millions, no, billions of computers connected together in order to share information and knowledge. They are all indexed and can be searched. Hermione had complained for a long time that Hogwarts Library missed a catalog, an index system. So during her last year at Hogwarts, she began this project with Professor Flitwick and a few other students. The idea of using advanced Protean Charm to communicate with the Repository came later. It took her several years to get it right. At first, members were writing commands on parchments, now it's all MirrorPhone. But I personally prefer parchments.

** I don't mind either way as long as it's accurate for the time frame. I would expect a fic about Albus & Scorpius to treat the Internet very differently than one that takes place right after DH ends.

This article + video talks about what the Internet was like in 1997 [[https://news.yahoo.com/blogs/sideshow/internet-in-1997-instructional-video-143754639.html]]

** Check out the stories of this user on fanfiction.net. It's a good series and even though it follows Dudley and his redemption, he also goes about innovating the wizarding world with phones and internet. Enjoy o7 [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3159722/][Jon8]]

** My experience has been that as a reader the whole time I'm reading a fic where the internet is a thing I'm thinking “ there's no way the wizarding world isnt exposed” and then the fic never covers that aspect because how do you stop people the world over from finding out about magic when someone can post a video to twitter and 30 seconds later it's gone viral? It adds to much complexity to the fic that so far I haven't seen any authors deal with in an elegant fashion.

*** I think the Dresden Files by Jim Butcher series' approach is best for that - simply, Humanity doesn't want to know that there are things that go bump in the night because that shit is scary. They don't need to hide, because we wouldn't believe it if we saw it. Or we would, and some people would go start a new religion in rural America somewhere. Either way, they're not a problem for the Supernatural peeps.

Someone posts that video, thirty seconds later it goes viral, then a few hours pass and someone releases a video 'proving' it's just a hoax. That'd convince most people, and the rest would likely be sceptical enough of the original video to not really get too involved either way. A week later and another political shitstorm would happen and we'd be distracted and forget entirely about it.

** If the Wizarding World were larger, I would agree that some magical information-sharing network would be an inevitability. With just ten thousand wizards in Britain, less so. That being said, it's still a hugely interesting idea --- but it's not one I've ever seen implemented, so I wouldn't know about how it would be received. Computers being made to work at Hogwarts or suchlike, yes. But a wholly magical Internet stand-in? First I hear of it in a HP context.
