It's been quite a few years since I've been involved in the HP community. I was in charge of a massive, smooth-running RP on Goodreads for a number of years, but since that became inactive, I've moved onto...well, adulting. Rowling's sad attempts at social justice haven't helped my interest.

Here's what I'm looking for.

-Canon-compliant...no retconning of events or relationships

-Addresses lore either before or after the main series (pre-1991, 1998-2017, post-2017)

-Utilizes or references OG characters to some degree (there needs to be some connection to the main narrative)

-Serious tone...I'm not really interested in slash or comedy

-Long-form --- novel-length, series a bonus

-Complete

I know these requirements are both rather broad, but also specific. In general, I'm looking for prequel/sequel kinds of things that seriously address what came before and what came after the main series. The most memorable fanfiction I read in college was G. Norman Lippert's James Potter series, and I want more of that.


** Perhaps stories by [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian]]?

** I second the Northumbrian recommendation. Also, I write about how much it sucks to be canon-compliant Remus between the wars. This one's complete:

  Complete! The Christmas of 1981 wasn't so merry for everyone. Who is this guy running from his past, trying to make it in the muggle world? What does he mean by the word “muggle,” anyway?Warning: this contains some disturbing stuff. The familiar characters and events in this are the property of J.K. Rowling of course.

  *SERIES COMPLETE!* Book 1/7. Structured like original HP books. Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all. COMPLETE!
