Since people are so prone to point out Dumbledore evilness in withholding information about the prophesy, I really wanna read a story where he tells a 11 year old he has to kill Hitler or die. Or horcruxes.

Like I understand the desire to have control over your own life, or how destiny must suck. But personally I am of belief that Dumbledore did the right thing. Not the best thing, but the right thing nonetheless.

Regardless, even if a different approach was taken, someone innocent would've died anyway.

Again, this is only pertaining to the prophesy and not all of Albus' decisions. Some of them were downright stupid (his desire to see good in enemies, for instance. Not bad per se, but Draco should've been dealt with).


** In my book he could have told him about the prophecy after the Triwizard Tournament and Goldie's return, I would have done it sooner and Harry already had faced plenty of shit by then. By after I don't mean immediately after of course, like wait a few weeks for things to settle a bit.

About the scarcrux, it was really shitty to wait until the last moment, but I can see where he was coming from. Harry might not have done it as it was supposed to happen if he had not been told at the right moment.

*** Harry was already breaking apart after the tournament. Let's face it, he would've run away or snapped if Dumbledore entrusted him with that knowledge. It's a given that Harry wanted more information on Voldemort; how to defeat him in a straight duel, not prophesies and deaths. It would be too much. He barely held it together at 17.

**** He might in the state he was in canon. But I imagine a Dumbledore who tells him about the prophecy a year earlier at least has the decency of ensuring Harry is in the right place before getting the news. Which would mean, no Dumbledore shunning him away and proper help to deal with the fallout of Cedric's death.

Let's face it, Dumbledore's greatest fail was not waiting until Harry was almost 16 to tell him of the prophecy, but throwing him with no psychological help to the Dursleys after what he went through at the graveyard.

***** I admit it was a foul leaving him with Dursley's. But I like to think they were all challenges he needed to overcome to build resilience. Again, it's not fun and it's unfair. I agree with that. But had he been shielded from every danger, how would he face the seventh year? In a way, he built an inner strength.

****** That's kind of okay when it happens by accident but kind of shitty when it could have been avoided. Harry could have been prepared in other ways

** “Dumbledore Answers Harry” linkffn(2994240), although he didn't tell him that he is to be killed in the first year (just the part of the Prophecy Snape heard). I don't remember what I thought the story, it was some time when I read it.

  AU When Harry is fighting Voldemort for the Philosopher's Stone, he makes the horrible discovery that he is keeping Voldemort alive by hosting a fraction of his soul. What is the rest of Harry's time at Hogwarts like when he knows that he has to die?

  Harry has been raised from the time he was five with full knowledge of what he was, a Horcrux, and how someday he would need to die to avenge his parents. Thus, when he finds Tom Riddle's diary in his second year, he recognizes it. Horcrux speaks to Horcrux, a game of persuasion and manipulation.
