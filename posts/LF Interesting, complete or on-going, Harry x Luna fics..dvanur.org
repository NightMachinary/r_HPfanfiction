I've just finished reading Luckner's Ice Cream Delights, on recommendation, and i was wondering if any of you had excellent Harry x Luna fics you could recommend. I spend most of my work day reading, since i just baby sit the machine all day.


** Even decent fics, let alone good ones, are quite rare with this pairing. You wouldn't think it with the Luna's relative prominence in canon, but then her "personality" isn't easy to really capture, partly because Rowling created something more like a caricature character to be provide another student who could see the thestrals and thus go to the Ministry with Harry and Co. Nevertheless, I will give you some that I think are worth noting for one reason or another:

- linkffn(Lovegood, Boobs Gooder): a post-OOTP summer fic and absolutely comedic, but still memorable. Complete.
- linkffn(Bungle in the Jungle: A Harry Potter Adventure): a 2nd person sort-of-Indy!Harry fic, this fic has a rendition of Luna that is not exactly her canon character, but the romance becomes more prominent in the sequel. Complete.
- linkffn(The Firebird's Son: Book 1 of the Firebird Trilogy): the H/L pairing is more prominent in Book 2, but its an intrinsic part of the story with Luna being more than just a side note. This fic is a harem fic as well, but arguably its one of maybe a half-dozen that I can stand/are somewhat decent, mainly because of both the intense worldbuilding and denouncing of harems in the fic itself. Complete (Trilogy).
- linkffn(Conlaodh's Song): sequel to the The Divining Light, somewhat fluffy H/L pairing where it occurs, though the sequel was never started for this fic. Complete.
- linkffn(The Quidditch World Cup): admittedly this fic has little to no "magic," and its characterizations are...not in line with canon shall we say, but it is a novella length story with slow-building towards a decent H/L relationship. Warning though, there are some dark discussions of trauma and depression midway through, so if your not able to handle that even being /discussed/ (though not shown), this may not be for you. Complete with epilogue.
- linkffn(Like A Redheaded Stepchild): almost crack fic too. Harry has red hair instead, and the fic only goes from 1-4 years, but the H/L pairing comes in about halfway through. Complete.
- linkffn(The Accidental Animagus): basically Harry is miraculously and inexplicably made a cat animagus so he can end up being raised with Hermione and the Grangers (authors favorite characters by far and used to "de-magic" HP world in every fic). The Harry/Luna stuff is actually pretty decent as things go, but doesn't really become prominent till 3rd-4th year in the fic, so you have to wade through a lot of repetitive story material. Complete with sequel ongoing.
- linkffn(Protection from Nargles): now this is a fic that captures the canon characters quite well. Basically Harry kisses Luna instead of Cho in OOTP, and we see the aftermath. Warning, this fic is so sweet and saccharine it may give you cavities (kidding). Complete, though sequel is likely to remain dead the first fic alone is relatively constrained.

There are a number of others, but at this point I am rambling a bit and most are incomplete (like literally 95% of all fanfics actually).

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Luna Challenge Response. Harry refuses to stay with the Dursleys and is now going to spend the summer hunting for Snorkacks with the Lovegoods. This is crude, immature, adult themed humor.

**** No problem. I have always had a soft spot for the pairing, though as I stated its not very common for a bunch of reasons.

If I may be so bold, I would like you to consider than when you are looking for romance-related stories, being complete honestly never really adds much, so you ought to not limit yourself in that regard. Besides which, fics that stick the landing at the end are actually incredibly rare (as writers often change/adapt the story as they write and find the ending doesn't work), and more often than not they break their ankle and comprise everything prior.

** Adding to those posted earlier:

linkffn(7284443) - Learning to Love Good. Harry gets it on with Luna after a heartbreak. Post-War. Ginny is not showed favourably here.

linkffn(7524855) - She Who Hesitates. Pure teenage romance.

linkffn(4056105) - Lovegood's Loving, Potter's Playmate. Part smut, part Ginny-bashing, part crack. But all fun.

linkffn(10108027) - After Dark. Harry and Luna try to unravel a very complicated mystery. Totally unique. I wish more HP fanfiction authors had such daring and original ideas.

linkffn(2635675) - Mr and Mrs Potter. It is based on an actual novel, so the plot is solid. Basically Luna and Harry get married for pregnant reasons after the war. Life happens later.

Anything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1327362/JJ-Rust][JJ Rust]] in his Harry Luna days. You will find a lot of gems there, even if they are short.
