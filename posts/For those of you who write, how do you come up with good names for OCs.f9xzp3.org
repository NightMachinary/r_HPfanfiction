Been thinking about writing again and I'm working on developing a female OC.


** There are some good baby name websites that are helpful. You can enter a canon name and it will tell you names that are similar (like from the same era, culture, class, etc.)

** UK Office of National Statistics has lists of the top names from every year. Helps keep things grounded rather than authors trying to one up each other with the most exotic sounding names that are enough to make me close the story.

** Since this is Harry Potter, you look at a character and their backstory and future story and general roles and give them a name that fits. Probably one that's alliterative.

Where's your OC from?

*** No clue yet. I'm American so I need to research the UK. Anytime anyone talks about any particular place in the UK I have no idea what they're talking about. It's weird because I used to live in Europe, and have decent geographic knowledge about Italy and Spain but none about the countries that speak the same language that I do.

Literally no clue where anything is. Except Ireland and Scotland. I think Wales is on a coast...

**** Ah, fair. Well, there are plenty of us Brits on the subreddit who can help if you're looking for a UK place. :)

And also we're pretty bad at States ourselves, so it's only fair. :D

But if you're looking for an English girl, you'll get some different names than if she's Irish, Scottish, Welsh, or from wherever in Europe, was my point. You'll rarely find an English girl named Caoimhe, for instance, but that's a thing in Ireland. It's worth at least setting a country while you're picking a name.

You can also then look up appropriate terms in various languages to see what fits. Like, if she was Eastern European, you could call her Athena Aspratiba. The latter name being Latvian for wit, since you said she was funny. That kind of thing.

**** Google maps - street view is a great way to go exploring in other countries even if you can't travel there to do research (wouldn't that be grand!).

I like to think of the familial background of my character... are they native to the area, or did their family immigrate (recently or generations ago?) and then research last names... either common ones or unusual ones. I think of characteristics and traits of my characters and then try to find suitable names by looking up name meanings.

I also look at popular names for the time and region the fiction takes place. For my Harry Potter fic, I really like thinking about how my characters are linked to the wixen world... what families they are related to... maybe they are siblings, cousins, aunts, uncles, etc. of Hogwarts students we've met briefly.

** I pick a country for origin, or at least a culture. Then I start filtering through words and names the best I can, VERBALLY testing them out. In my experience, names never work well if you can't pronounce them fluidly the first couple times. Last names I always go for something common, but still culture significant. Names that are family based (patronymic for example) are easier to do, similar for profession based names but never have a last name match their current occupation, it's too obvious. I'll give some examples, French first names: Louise, Manon, Bastien. Last names: [patronymic] “adds -elin” to fathers name- Pierrelin [occupation] “tailor” - Couture [common] “beautiful hill” - Beaumont

Basically, go for easy names that are shifted based on cultural or regional significance. Don't go overboard with it if your character is a child, and don't devote all your time to trying to explain it! I use this for all of my OC's when I can, and never reuse a name after it's been in one story. Hope this helps!

** I love coming up with names for OCs. If the OC is from an established canon family I'll look to their canon relatives for inspiration. For example stars/constellations for members of the Black family, King Arthur legends for Weasleys or names that just “sound” good together for siblings. Draco wouldn't have a sister named Jessica but he might have a sister named Lyra or Carina.

Otherwise I use a mixture of Latin names, names from mythology, popular baby names in the UK during the time the character was born or random name generators. I will sparingly have them named after deceased family / friends when it comes to next gen (I have an OC named Colin Longbottom).

** Thanks yall! I think I've narrowed it down to the following:

Athena (I'm leaning towards this one. Any nicknames yall can think of?CelineCeleste (I used to work with an awful woman named Celeste and I can't stop thinking about it. But I kinda like the name.)IrisZara

My character is smart, fairly athletic, and can be funny. I want her to have a somewhat feminine side that comes out sometimes.
