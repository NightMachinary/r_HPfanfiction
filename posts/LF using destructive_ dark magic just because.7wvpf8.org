Are there any fics where the main character uses questionable magic just because it's awesome and good for blowing stuff up?

You know without some philosophical journey, endless shame and self justification, or being seduced into darkness by their new gay boyfriend?

** Does linkffn(11280068) count? I recall Valerie having an affinity for destruction and fire. I think she likes/uses Fiendfyre? Haven't read it a while, so not too sure.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.
