What tropes and tags do you hate in fanfics?

Personally I think the Lord trope and Harry ridiculously rich are really boring.They often include thefts of hundreds of Harry's vaults by Dumbledore and the Weasley and the inevitable visit to Gringott with friendly goblins.


** I kind of feel like if you hate the trope, you should love the tag, since it makes the fic easier to avoid.

** Y'know a tag I hate? When people don't flair their posts correctly!

Anyways, this would be the “Discussion” flair, since it wants communication & input from other people.
