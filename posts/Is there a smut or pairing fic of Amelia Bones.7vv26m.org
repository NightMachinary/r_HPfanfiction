** There's one on AFF, in which she rapes Harry. It is bad enough that I wouldn't recommend it, but if you're nonetheless interested I can dig up the link

** I know [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11578938/41/The-Breeding-Ground]] has the pairing although it's together with Susan Bones.

Then there is also linkffn(Whiskey Contract by Acheron Agrotera), but it also isn't pure Harry/Amelia and I honestly don't know if there is smut, because I broke off after the 2nd chapter.

** Fair note that I haven't actually read any of these, but they are all related explicit with Amelia as what appears to be a main character in the main pairing. Unfortunately, this was all I could find that both probably contains smut and is complete.
