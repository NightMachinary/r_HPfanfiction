As the title says, I'm wondering if Sirius had lived how he would have reacted to the news that Harry is a Horcrux and has to die for Voldemort to die too. Obviously the situation as it was in canon didn't leave much time for discussions, but I'm generally interested in what you think his thoughts could have been. In the confrontation with Pettigrew in PoA he says that he would have died to protect his friends, so does he expect the same from Harry? Or does Harry being the son of James and pretty much still a child change things? He always encouraged reckless behaviour in Harry, but he also cared about him and in the end died protecting Harry. So what do you think?


** If he was still alive at the time he would be absolutely devastated. All he ever wanted to do was protect Harry, and for him to learn it was all for nothing would be pretty heart breaking for him I imagine. He would probably try to find another way to remove it, but who wouldn't I guess.

But if he was dead, like in the book, I would probably think he would be proud? Maybe he would see that sometimes it's necessary to sacrifice yourself? I don't know honestly.

I would love to read some fics where this situation happens though.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

  but who wouldn't

According to canon, Harry wouldn't. You can argue circumstances, but still...

** There would be a huge argument between he and Harry if he saw the memory at the same time. Harry would argue based on that very thing: he'd die to protect his friends just like Sirius would. Sirius would be crushed and want to go with him, but Harry would then make Sirius promise to kill the snake.

They'd both know that, with Harry dead, Sirius wasn't going live much longer. Sirius would be fully intending to die in the final battle while taking as many death eaters and hopefully Voldemort with him.

*** oh god

I just had the worst idea for a fic ever.

Sirius knows that Harry's going to die, so he DOES die fighting. Before Harry wakes up.

nope nope nope

No. No. No. He can challenge Voldemort, be a second away from death while laughing madly, and then Harry throws a shield over him. Surprise happy ending!
