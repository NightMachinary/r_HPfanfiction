Harry Potter was gifted with an invisibility cloak. Harry Potter has had a taste of polyjuice and has seen veritaserum in action. He's abused time travel to save himself (damn deus ex) and sneaked (loosely speaking, more like walked right in) in the Department of Mysteries. He's broken in a Voldemort controlled Ministry and then in Gringots (and got away with pivotal artifacts). He managed to cast the Imperius curse on his first try. And every one of those events happened by chance and luck, with just bare bones preparation and planning.

Now imagine if Harry Potter actually planned and meant to do all those things, but for his own reasons. Stealth, espionage, thieving, assassinations. What I'm looking for is a daredevil Harry that actually saw how easily magic can be exploited and took full advantage of what he's learned. A Harry Potter for whom a bag of holding is his best friend (to keep all of the gadgets, potions and loot), who actually thinks "If Snape gets to read anyone's mind, why shouldn't I?", who would happily bribe the goblins for information on shady deals or dealers.

TLDR: Give me your best Assassin!Thief!Spy!Agent!Harry where stealth, trickery and careful planning are his friends.


** Well... in linkffn(A Black Comedy) Sirius and Harry go and free Death Eaters of their worldly possessions.

*** That's not really super 'cloak-and-dagger' though, more just camaraderie with a little bit of man-child-esque skulking around. Still a fantastic read and definitely one of my favourite fics though.

** Zeitgeist84 writes exactly what you're looking for imo. Harry ends up an auror, gets bored, and then joins magical MI6. Great writing. Been wait for an update on Midnight Blues and King of Limbs.

** I remember reading a story about Harry being trained by the Department of Mysteries in his childhood. He had a commander/partner and they went after paedophiles and other bad guys. Harry also has metamorphomagus powers. I think the last thing I read about was them going into this giant hole in the ground that functioned as the magical world's blackest of black markets + slum society that people are born into and never leave.

I think/hope I gave enough information for someone who is more read and better organized than me to be able to find it.

  He was meant to be the perfect soldier, the ultimate sacrifice for peace. The Department of Mysteries had other plans. On indefinite hold.
