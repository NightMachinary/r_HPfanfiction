In the stories Harry met Draco before Ron and there was several of the stories (I Think up to book 5) based on this premise. I can't remember the name of the stories, but I remember a lot of other details, if anyone could help me find this!


** Harry meets Draco before Ron in canon. Anyways, I'm going to guess that it's linkffn(7659033).

  After swearing I was done tinkering with the first entry in the series, the Muse struck me. Essentially the same story, but with a more solid introduction to the new characters. Names changed to protect the innocent. Less canon text. More Snape!

*** Is the new version any better than the old one? I remember the old version being fairly bad grammatically.

**** I haven't read a significant amount of either to comment. I didn't find the story to be that interesting so I dropped it before I got too far.

**** The new one changes some characters' names to fit canon and I think is cleaned up grammatically as well.

** Maybe its this one: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8666085/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Slytherin-Selection]]

Sounds atleast a lot like it (I think its up to book 6 atm, but I stopped reading it like a year ago)
