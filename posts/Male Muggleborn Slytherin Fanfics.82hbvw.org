Basically what the title implies. Fanfics in which Male( and no I'm not being sexist, it's just that I've already come across a lot of female ones and no males) muggle-borns are sent into Slytherins and their experiences within the house. So can someone please refer to me some good ones?


** linkffn(Story of the Guys) Roger Appleby is a Slytherin muggle-born, who rounds out Harry's own version of the Marauders.

  Spinoff to 'HP: The Lone Traveller'. The story of Harry James Potter, the brother of the supposed BoyWhoLived, and his friends... My take on the old 'Harry the brother of the BWL' & 'Harry the Slytherin' plotline.

** I'd read that. Maybe put Justin Finch-Fletchley in there? He was down for Eton before his Hogwarts letter came, so he's got to be capable of some interesting things, right?

*** All you really have to be capable of to get into Eton is having the right parents.
