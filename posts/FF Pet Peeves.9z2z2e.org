Reading a fanfic and in the first chapter Dumbledore has referred to Harry as “Young Harry” 3 times already.

What is that? It's a fifth year fic. He's not a first year anymore.

Anyway what are some of the biggest pet peeves that you've recently discovered that take you out of the story immediately?


** Nothing that makes me quit immediately, but I hate how many authors at any cost try to avoid calling characters by their name.

..., the black-haired boy said.

..., the blonde answered

..., the emerald-eyed teenager agreed

..., the taller of the boys said

..., the raven-haired boy with Avada Kedavra green orbs interjected

Ok, the last one was exaggerated.

** To be fair, Dumbledore is 150, Harry is 16. Even irl some teachers consider high school students 'kids'.

*** I outright giggled and that's not a good sound coming from me. Cool idea though. Adventures of Harry and Peeves where Harry is a loner with Peeves as his only friend.

** My pet peeve is people talking about Pet Peeves, which immediately makes me think I should write something where Harry adopts Peeves as his pet and takes him home on the train at the end of first year.

** Repetition of words can be annoying to the reader, hence why some authors try to avoid repeating names over and over again. Beginners may have difficulties finding a proper "middle way". - Rowling herself used names alot, so often in fact that I found myself disliking a few scenes because she wrote "Harry" instead of "he",- which may be excused because there were two "he's" in the scene, - then again, maybe its something English? Who knows.

​

Regarding the often abused green eyes. This is an important outer trait of Harry's character. But instead of repeating the fact that he has green eyes, emerald, as green as jade, and whatnot, they should describe what effects the outer traits of a character or the personal traits - characteristical behavior etc. may have on others.

** Mine is when they repeat the same phrase over and over again like I read a half decent fic a couple of months ago but they used green eyed wizard to describe harry like 274$37272 times every chapter so it got dropped

Also any kind of bashing like come on write a good story

** Any story where Harry miraculously becomes the head of countless noble houses, the beneficiary of millions of galleons, and a savvy political operator at the age of 11 is grating. These stories always seem to forget that Harry is a kid and not some kind of Machiavellian political genius.

** 1. Banishing an object is not the same thing as vanishing it.
2. Fouling the timeline in stories: things from book 5 and beyond are referenced in stories set during earlier books.
3. 300,000 word stories that only cover 3 months of timeline and yet are still not a complete story.

** Biggest pet peeve? Character bashing. Especially if it's combined with Harry "wising up and realizing he's being used" or whatever, and then takes revenge in a way that's probably meant to be cathartic, but just comes across as petty and childish.

** Any kind of bashing. As in, portraying a character in a bad way that is not supported by canon. Dumbledore isn't evil (misguided sometimes, possibly manipulative, but never evil), James isn't abusive, Ron isn't greedy, etc.

Authors portraying characters as being bad isn't a bad thing, but they need to do it in a way that is /plausible/ with what we know is supported in canon. All the above examples can be portrayed both as less than honorable, or as great people, but /bashing/ just makes the fic bad.
