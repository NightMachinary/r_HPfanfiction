Points it at his neck. "Hold it!" Harry said in a gruff tone. "Next man makes a move, the wizard gets it."

A few moments of silence pass.

"Hold it men, he's not bluffing." Voldemort warns his Death Eaters.

Lucius Malfoy yells "Listen to him men, he's just crazy enough to do it!"

"Drop it! Or I swear I'll blow this wizard's head all over this town." Harry's voice transformed into a more pleading tone. "Oh lord, he's desperate. Do what he says. /Do what he says/."

The Death Eaters hesitantly put away their wands.

Harry then pulls himself away as if he were being dragged by another person.

"Isn't anyone going to help that poor boy?" Bellatrix Lestrange asked.

"Hush Bellatrix, that's a sure way to get him killed" Lucius answered.

Harry's pleading tone continued as he dragged himself towards a building door. "Oh! Oh! Help me! Help me! Help me! Somebody help me! Help me! Help me! Help me!" Harry's tone transformed back into a gruff sound. "Shut up!" He says as he opens a door.

Harry covers his mouth with his hand and throws himself into the building. Now safe from harm, he allows himself to relax. "Oh baby, you are so talented, and they are so /dumb/."

(If you didn't get it, it's a Blazing Saddles reference)

** /later on in the story/

Lucius Malfoy and a group of Death Eaters approaches a swinging arm that blocks their path. The small stand has a sign saying "Lord Voldemort Thruway - 10 Sickles." The light was flashing red.

Malfoy grimaced at the sign. He muttered, "What'll that asshole think of next?" Louder he shouted, "Anyone got any Sickles?"

The crowd with him grumbled in disagreement, which didn't improve his mood.

"Somebody's got to go back and get a shitload of Sickles!"

I don't know much about youtube's policies but some time ago they demonetized several history-themed channels. We are talking about people who are doing documentaries in their free time with their own money. And they put a lot of effort in them and were unbiased. And youtube just screwed them over because apparently, we can't talk about Hitler and Stalin anymore.

There's a scene where some aurors, grizzled veterans of the force with mustaches and beards, are sent to the school in newby robes and are bullied by fourteen -year-old Slytherins because they haven't been sorted and obviously will all end up in Hufflepuff.

** Later in the story, Voldemort learns that someone is a spy and is trying to figure out who it is through interrogation (Ã  la Catch 22):

'You're a sneaky son of a bitch, aren't you? Nobody asked you for clarification and you're giving me clarification. I was making a statement, not asking for clarification. You are a sneaky son of a bitch, aren't you?' Voldemort sneered, hoping to get a confession out of the man in front of him.

'No, my lord.' the death eater said loyally. He was still wearing his mask for some reason.

'No? Are you calling Lord Voldemort a liar?' Voldemort asked angrily

'Oh, no, my Lord.' the death eater assured him.

'Then you're a sneaky son of a bitch, aren't you?'

'No, my lord.' Voldemort's eyes flared a blood red.

'Are you a sneak son of a bitch?' Voldemort asked once more through gritted teeth, hoping the death eater would just confess.

'No, my lord.' the death eater repeated, shaking his head.

'Goddammit, you are trying to pick a fight with me?! For two knuts I would crucio you until you go mad!' shrieked Voldemort, slamming his hand down on the table.

'Do it! Do it!' cried Lucius.

'Lucius you stupid son of a bitch. Didn't I tell you to keep your weak, cowardly, stupid mouth shut?'

'Yes, my lord. I'm sorry, my lord.'

'Then suppose you do it.'

'I was only trying to learn, my lord. The only way a person can learn is by trying.'

'Who says so?' Voldemort asked irritably. He would find whoever said so and murder them when he was finished with this circus of an interrogation.

'Everybody says so, my lord. Even Bellatrix says so.'

'Do you say so?' Voldemort asked, glancing at his most trusted lieutenant.

'Yes, sir,' said Bellatrix, 'But everybody says so.'

'Well, Lucius, suppose you try keeping that stupid mouth of yours shut, and maybe that's the way you'll learn how. Now, where were we? Read me back the last line.' Voldemort said, turning his focus back to the death eater across from him

' "Read me back the last line," ' read Lucius, who was taking notes on the interrogation

'Not my last line, stupid!' Voldemort shouted. 'Somebody else's.'

' "Read me back the last line," ' Lucius read back

'That's my last line again!' shrieked Voldemort, turning on Lucius, his eyes smoldering with anger.

'Oh, no, my Lord,' corrected Lucius. 'That's my last line. I read it to you just a moment ago. Don't you remember? It was only a moment ago.'
