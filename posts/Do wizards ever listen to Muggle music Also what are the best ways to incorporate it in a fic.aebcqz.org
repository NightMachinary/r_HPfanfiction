** Judging by how "Do the Hippogriff" is a blatant ripoff of "Dancing with Myself" by Billy Idol, I'd say that wizards listening to Muggle music (and then stealing it) is canon üòÄ

***** The movies aren't canon. They are head canon acceptable at best. If it isn't in the original works, the books, it isn't canon. If there is any contradiction, the books win. The simple fact that it isn't in the books also means it isn't part of canon.

Sure, you are free to pull some ideas from movie into your head canon, but those ideas are only in your imagination. At best, they are theoretically possible.

******* If you take Pottermore (JK Rowling's written bits, at least) as canon, it is! A muggle ended up accidentally taking a Portkey to a Celestia Warbeck concert, and even got invited up on stage with her. They were Obliviated afterward, but there were still some imprints of the concert in their memory, and they later made a hit muggle song that was uncannily similar to one of Celestina's.

** One of my favorite uses of muggle music in a fic is in /The Boy Who Died A Lot/. Snape sort of becomes an ally to the Ford Anglia after it runs wild in the Forest. It communicates by playing snatches of different songs. I make it sound horrible, but it's hilarious. (FYI, that's a Snape/Harry story, but if you don't like slash it's still worth reading, at the very least in part, for a number of funny and creative moments.) linkao3(670548).

** Dumbledore's chocolate frog card says that he enjoys chamber music (classical pieces composed for only a few instruments), knitting patterns, and ten-pin bowling, so there's obviously some crossover in entertainments. For my own part, I would hate to see the characters form a band [no doubt to raise money to save the house-elves!] but I'm delighted to include a school-only radio station playing music from the 80's and early 90's.

And polkas.

Because Peeves and polkas just make sense.

** I don't see why not. I'm sure plenty of muggle-borns and half-bloods do, and even some pure-bloods. Nothing is stopping them, at least, and I imagine many music lovers would want to eventually branch out into the muggle world once they get tired with the little amount of music they likely have in the wizarding world.

**** Radios might work if you have an EMP protected one. Or not, it depends on your interpretation of "magic interferes with electrical circuitry"

One thing which is guaranteed to work is mechanical record players (early 20th century) because they don't require electricity to produce sound. You would just need to get the music pressed on a compatible record, but that should be doable (even if you might need more than one due to the smaller "memory" of older records).

  ‚ÄúJust... tell me.
