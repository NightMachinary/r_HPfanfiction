"Mum, how did the baby get into your tummy?" "Apparition." "How did he do it without splinching?" "He side-alonged with the Stork." "Is there a bird in your tummy too?" "No; the Stork left after apparating my baby." "A bird that can apparate? Is it like a Phoenix?" "Sure." "Why have I never seen this Stork?" "The Pregnancy Stork only shows itself to Mummies." "Like a Thestral?" "I... guess...? (Who is telling you about all of these?)" "(Charlie.) Didn't you tell it to bring you a girl?" "I /asked/ for a girl, but I can't control what it gifts me with." "/'Gifts'?/ Is a baby a gift?" "Yes." "Can you return him on Boxing Day and ask for an exchange?" "Uhhh...."

6-8 Years Later: "Listen here, Percy; it's time we talked about babies." "Why?" "Well, see, having a baby doesn't involve /quite/ as much magic as we led you to believe." "What?"

**** Or Mandrakes are connected to hell and those screams we hear are the screams of tormented souls from hell
