If Hermione hadn't gone to Hogwarts, I kind of think she would have continued to be the unpopular smart girl, gone to a good university, gotten married late in life to some tweedy intellectual, stayed on the straight and narrow, and generally had the most dull and uninteresting life ever. So I've always been fascinating by contrasting a muggle version of Hermione with the badass Hogwarts-version of Hermione that we know in canon.

I'm looking for fics in which adult/Hogwarts-age Hermione interacts with muggles, for example, 30yo Hermione meets an old acquaintance from her primary school years. Or where Hermione runs into muggle friends during the summer.

To be clear, I'm not talking about fics in which we learn about Hermione's awesome self-insert muggle BFF. Just fics in which we see Hermione's muggle life and "What might have been."

Also if anyone can think of any fics in which Hermione turns down the wizarding world and ends up getting dragged into it sometime after her first year, that would be interesting too. For example, Hermione turns down Hogwarts but ends up being forced to come during fifth year after something happens.

Basically fics in which you can compare canon Hermione to the person she would have been in the muggle world.

I highly disagree. A person's character isn't tied to whether or not they have magic.

Hermione is an activist who uses her brain to make the world better for everyone and who isn't afraid to get her hands dirty and tackle controversial topics. deep down she is a Gryffindor and not a Ravenclaw.

Even a muggle Hermione wouldn't just get married to some tweety intellectual without passion.

I agree. I believe Hermione would have attended law school and become a barrister or solicitor, a defender of the downtrodden. She would have also kept up with her piano, providing her another outlet for passion.
