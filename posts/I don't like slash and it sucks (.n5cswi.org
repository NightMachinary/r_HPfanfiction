Whilst being named Harry irl is the reason I like the books and fanfic so much it's sometimes extremely annoying in that I can struggle to read slash. Obviously I have absolutely nothing against it in any way its just not for me and reading it makes me a bit uncomfortable which SUCKS because so many of the best fanfics are slash. Any others Harrys that find it so easy to escape into any half decent Harry-centric specifically fanfic?


** So you're saying you hate reading slash with Harry because you're named Harry?

** I feel like that about most sex stories to be honest, even though I'm not a Harry. ðŸ˜„ I like romance of all flavors, I just personally feel we don't always need to see the sex.

*** I could not agree more. It's perfectly fine to simply imply what's going to happen, and lead into it with a healthy dose of tasteful sensuality. There's no need for porn.

*** I also feel that way about sex. I understand why some people want to write it and some people want to read it, but it's not for me. I start skimming once it's sexy time.

*** Nice to see you are supportive of people's right to read or not read whatever they like. No one said that slash = porn; the OP said they don't enjoy reading slash, and the only comment mentioning porn was an answer to a comment about disliking all sex. No one is saying those things can't or shouldn't exist, they're just saying that 'they' don't like them.

*** Learn to read. Seriously. Learn. To. Read.

If you had actually paid any attention to what you were reading, then you would have realized that not a single person here said anything negative about the LGBTQ community. We were talking about sex in stories, in general.

I swear, some people go looking for and see bias and discrimination everywhere, regardless of whether it's there or not. I don't like reading slash. Does that make me an intolerant arsehole and a bigot? No, it just means people like different things.

** Sometimes I think many fanfic writers actually wrote slash stories as vengeance when JK Rowling said she was homophobic or so.....more like just cause you hate it we gonna make your best work in that way
