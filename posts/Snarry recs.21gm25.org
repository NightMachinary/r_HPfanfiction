Please! Please? Please!


** I would love to list some for you, but I recently switched to a new computer and lost all of my bookmarks. Are you familiar with Walking The Plank (Snarry site)?

EDIT: Try [[http://inkstain.inkquill.net/isf/archive/21/achoriambic.html][A Choriambic Progression]] and let me know if it's as good as I remember. It's been a few years. Just had the sudden urge to pick up some Snarry again... which brought me here.

  For Severus, everything changes when Harry and his children move into Hogwarts. Little Albus Severus has taken a liking to him and it seems Harry Potter has a secret.

** One shot humor? [[http://www.icarus.slashcity.net/stories/cursedartefacts.html][Cursed Artefacts for Sale]] by Icarus.

#+begin_quote
  Severus drags Harry to a Wizarding auction. "Collecting Cursed Artefacts is a registered form of madness in the Compendium of Wizarding Mental Disorders and Other Things That Make You Twitch," Severus said, "like most compulsions to collect. But it's very a popular one and I plan to beat everyone else to it."

Tea by Telanu

Straightforward, set in hogwarts-era, extremely hot at times and emotional at others. Characters are true to themselves.

** Okay, I've been holding off on this one until I finished it... but Cybele (the writer of [[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewseries.php?seriesid=29][If You Are Prepared]]... which if you haven't read that, I highly recommend it) just finished [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/34560][For Auld Lang Syne]] this January!

It's about 300,000 words. Epilogue-compliant, spans from about six months postwar to a few months after the epilogue. There are non-Snarry pairings, including some OCs, which normally I wouldn't like, but it just works. It's very emotional, and just really, really lovely.
