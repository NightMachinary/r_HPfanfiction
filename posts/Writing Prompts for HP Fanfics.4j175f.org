** I was just about to suggest a pinned prompt thread.

+Or someone+I +could+did start a subreddit called [[/r/HarryPrompter]].

**** I subbed there too. Seeing the different stories that come from the same prompt is always fun.

Edited to add: Couldn't help myself. I whipped up a fic and posted in the sub thanks to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HarryPrompter/comments/4j1i38/a_family_returning_home_after_being_detained_in_a/][this]] prompt.

***** Thank you! It means a lot to hear that because I have been out of practice for a while and am just getting back into writing. I'm working on the Dean/Seamus one too, but I don't feel that I'm getting it quite right yet. I'll post it when I'm done!

*** For whatever reason, my muse loves prompts, so I've written two one-shots because of your sub already.

*** I think so, probably. I just wanted to know if people were interested, really. Like if there would be enough participation

** On fanfiction dot net, there is a Quidditch League fanfiction competition that has teams set, but even if you aren't competing, the prompts posted every fortnight are usually pretty good. They previous seasons are archived.

*** Maybe it's because I looked on my phone, but it seemed weirdly organized. I couldn't find the actual prompts, just team assignments and responses

**** Yeah, the prompts will be on threads that say "...game day round x."

** This is a good idea. A lot of the requests I see here seem to be more like writing prompts in their complexity, so a dedicated thread or a tag or something could help parse them from everything else.

*** I like the idea of tags to separate full prompts from just like, little ones. Maybe like OS WP (one shot writing prompt) and MC WP (multi chapter writing prompt) or something. One shots could function like the writing prompt sub with responses posted as comments, and longer ones could be linked to. The requests do come off that way, especially the super specific ones
