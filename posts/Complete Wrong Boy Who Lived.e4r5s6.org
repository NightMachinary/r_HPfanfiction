I have never read a WBWL fic and thought I would give it a go. What are the best complete fics where Harry is thought not to be the defeater of Voldemort but actually is. I don't care about who is bashed or not but Harry has to be the actual person to stop Tom but someone else is thought to be. MUST BE COMPLETE

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

***** Hard disagree on that front as someone who reads slash, het, and gen.

Maybe in another fandom this is true, but considering the bulk of HP fics are slash, statistically it means a good percentage of the “good fics” also happen to be slash fics. You're pulling that 5% out of your ass lmao.

Like no seriously, where are you pulling this statistic out of? The representation on this sub? Because this sub is notorious for hating on slash fics and is absolutely not representative of the larger HP fanfic community.

Writing straight ships doesn't suddenly make people better writers lmao. Nor vice versa.

****** I've barely ever seen any good slash fics, the only ones I've ever seen has already been recced on DLP. And of those good ones, the majority is femslash.

The reason why slash tends to be hated here on this sub is not as simple as people disliking slash due to sexuality. If anything it's more that some people on this sub has some degree of standards (not reading absolute trash), especially considering that those standars are already quite low.

I'm sorry if I don't want to read:

•No plot fics

•Super ooc fics (I can accept some degree of ooc ofc)

• Shit writing (grammar, telling instead of showing, can't handle more than one plot point at once)

• Butchered characterization, a lot of slash writers tends to make the homosexual part of a character the main point of the fic, what's the point then?

• A ton of slash fics tends to contain too much bashing. Come on, it's not 2006 anymore, excessive bashing hasn't changed for shit,it's not creative, it's flawed, it's too often used by the author to justify screwing characters (s)he hates.

• Homosexual slash fics written by teenage girls, pretty self-explainatory

My point is not that writing het makes someone a better writer.

If anything, better writers tends to write more het than slash. The demography for the authors matters a lot

******* You clearly don't read enough slash (or any slash at all) to make that judgment call (also once again it's a game of statistics, femslash is very small in the HP community so there is /statistically/ absolutely no way it has a larger pool of better fics than het or slash or gen).

And better writers don't tend towards het. By saying that you're implying either a) only inexperienced/young authors are interested in portraying homosexual relationships, or b) men are better writers than women (because obviously women are the target demographic for slash meanwhile most men write het). The first is wrong because being interested in homosexuality is not age/skill reliant. At worst the first implies homophobia and the second implies sexism. Neither of which are true.

Obviously it's no secret that teenage girls love slash. But come on dude. The HP fanfic community is way over a decade old (as you even said so yourself!). Plenty of teenage girls are now grown women who are still interested in slash (note: this coincides closely to the decline of Drarry fics and the surge in popularity of more mature themed LVHP/Tomarry fics).

Clearly very few to zero teenagers (male or female) are going to be banging out gorgeous pieces of literature. But to claim that the slash community is made up of only teenage girls is absolutely false. The HP slash community has no less amazing adult writers as the het community (more I'd argue due to the sheer size of the community). You're simply conflating the sheer number of teenage girls in the slash community with the overall number of great stories.

In simpler terms: 10 good fics out of 1000 bad fics is still equal to 10 good fics out a 100 bad fics.

Also, the ooc complaint? The het community is just as much a culprit of that crime as any. In fact, all the complaints you mentioned are equally as prevalent in other types of fics too. All except character bashing, I'll give you that. But obviously stories with character bashing aren't going to be listed amongst the good stories.

******** A lot of text for no substance.

If you regularly find good slashfics, then you have a bad taste

If you regularly find good het fics, then you have a bad taste. There is not many good fics to begin with.

With over 800k fics (on ffnet, not counting ao3 etc) there is still less than 1000 good fics, and of those, there's not many good slashfics.

If good slashfics were as common as you say, how have I missed them then? Been reading fanfics for a decade and I don't really have an aversion to homosexuality to begin with.

********* I don't regularly find good fics. But you claimed that most of the good fics in the HP fandom reside primarily within the het and femslash genre. That is absolutely false. You claimed that “slash fics make up less than 5% of good fics” which is, once again, /statistically false/.

No substance? You've yet to counter my evidence using basic statistics with anything of substance yourself. You have no first hand evidence.

You're only claiming what you claim because of a baseless believe that slash fiction is somehow worse than other fiction. Just because you have no aversion to homosexuality doesn't mean you don't have representation bias based on your fanfic preferences. Do you seek out slash fics to read for enjoyment on a regular basis? No? Then you don't have enough experience on the topic.

You do see how it's kinda ridiculous to try and argue with someone who has far more experience with a certain subject than you about facts you basically made up?
