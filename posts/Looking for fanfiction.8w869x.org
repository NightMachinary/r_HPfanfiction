Good morning y'all :)

I've spent hours these past few weeks trying to find a few fanfictions I read a long time ago but I haven't been able to find them. Mostly because I can't remember neither name nor author and just little pieces. Maybe you can help me still :)

Fanfiction N1 was Hermione being turned into a spy by the order and taking some sort of potion that disguised her as a Crouch and distant cousin of Lucius. She was friends/accomplices with Snape and the pairing was Bellamione - they ended up supporting Voldemort who had known about the ruse but decided to keep it quiet since Hermione was the only one keeping Bellatrix sane and in check. He killed Pettigrew in the end. I am halfway sure that it was taken down off [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] but I'm hoping, yes?

Fanfiction N2 was a female Harry Potter story where Harry was abused by the Dursleys (I think sexually?) and came to Hogwarts with very different ideas about sexuality and nakedness. I remember she allowed Ron and Neville to see her naked and had no qualms about it. I think she convinced Hermione to do it too later. That's all I know though I think it was hosted on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] as well.

Fanfiction N3 involved Lily practising very old Potter magic (dark and blood magic I guess) through an old book that was spelled so it could be picked up and read by women since men would be harmed. McGonagall and Snape discovered it under her bed in a trunk or something when they looked through the Godric's Hollow ruins to try and find some things for Harry so he had stuff from his parents.

And N4 is actually an author. They had a profile on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] and their name was something like illdig or lldig or something like that. They wrote adult stuff and their most popular fanfiction was some sort of Bellamione with odd creature parts mixed in.

I'd be very happy if someone can find at least one of those since the search has been driving me mad. Thanks in advance :D

EDIT: N1, N3 and N4 were found! :)

*** Waaah, oh my God thank you! Those are some of my most favourite fanfics and I was so upset that they were gone! I will treasure them forever and ever. Thank you so much =)

And actually fanfic N1 that I was looking for is among those. You're a right treasure.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!
