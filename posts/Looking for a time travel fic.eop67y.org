:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for a fanfic where Harry goes back in time and takes up a professor role and also used the name Harry Fawkes (I'm sure about the surname that he uses) and Dumbledore knows why he's back in time and what he needs to achieve. Harry also needs the elder wand to defeat Tom and do in order to win it's allegiance, Harry and Dumbledore duel on a platform on the quidditch pitch at Hogwarts with Flitwick as the referee.

Any idea which one this is?
