** Curtesy of perspicacity:

Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. Normal, that is, for intelligence agents in deep cover. They went to quite a lot of trouble to have their neighbors believe that they were the last people anyone would expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious. They were frighteningly good at their spycraft.

When he wasn't tailing suspicious characters in his heavily modified sedan, Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings. An MI-6 front operation, they made drills as a means of dodging well-meaning but potentially vexing tax inquiries. He was a big, beefy man who could easily break your neck. He also had a very large mustache, an essential part of his disguise. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde, with a long neck and a penchant for firearms. When she wasn't at the firing range, honing her considerable skills, she spent her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors, and generally seeking information on any nefarious actors operating out of this nondescript suburb. The Dursleys completed their cover with a small son called Dudley, trained from birth to notice things and report to his handlers. Having guided his training, in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.

The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it.

They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters.

**** Then the Dursleys could contribute meaningfully to the fight against Voldemort and even die a heroic death.

Good, strong Dursleys would also *avoid* turning Dumbledore into a criminally negligent shithead, and this would make perfect sense for Dumbledore to place Harry with them.

If Voldemort murdered them too, it could deal real blow to Harry. In that case, I'd like to see them leaving behind some useful intel and tools (including weapons) for Harry that would prove decisive against Voldemort.

** If you want an MI6 version of the Wizarding World, then I would offer [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822-1/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]], although the Dursleys aren't the secret agents. It reimagines the whole series with advanced technology replacing magic; Hermione is recruited to go to "Harworts", where she's trained in chemistry and computer hacking and using firearms and so forth, and Harry is being groomed by Headmaster Dumont Appledore to face Lord Deathstrike so that he can someday qualify to become the next 007 at an unusually early age.

It's self-contained and complete, but also takes place within a larger multi-crossover universe, "The League of Extraordinary Women," if you like the author's work.

#+begin_quote
  Very whimsical and written tongue-in-cheek. This explores why Vernon and Petunia were so fanatical about being normal, and involves HM Government's magical division
