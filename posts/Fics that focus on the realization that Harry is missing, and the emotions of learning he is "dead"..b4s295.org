I'm looking for stories that focus on the feelings and emotions of the other characters, when they realize Harry is missing, and later hear and see that he is "dead". Preferably with their reactions in the immediate aftermath of finding out he is actually alive.

I feel like they'd have to call him "The boy who lived twice" after that fiasco.

*** I think OP is looking more for reactions during the events of the battle of hogwarts, when Harry goes into the forbidden forest and comes out 'dead', hence the quotes in OP

  When something terrible happens to Harry, Hermione is left with a strange feeling... or lack thereof. Watch as she consults an old friend and tries to understand why everything just seems so... well...
