Do you think it was only because of his horcruxes? Or is it something that everyone does when they get too entrenched in dark magic? Or is it only for Dark Lords, and by that I mean powerful practitioners of dark magic (i.e. would Dumbledore's eyes turn red if he went deep enough into it?)?


** In LinkAo3(Blood Crest by Cauchy), Voldemort enchanted his eyes (we don't know why yet, but Blood Crest is the sort of fic where we'll surely find out not just why he did that, but why other people don't).

** I'm sure it was just one more effect of the dark magic in his appearance. I would guess that it would happen to anyone had they created just as many horcruxes.

** I think it's weed. A lot of God men smoke intoxicants when they meditate or undertake rituals of "power" etc. They'll get fucking stoned and say things that sound wise and their followers lose their minds over it.

** We're not sure why.

Personal headcanon? Powerful magic influences the user, including appearance, and it's most obviously reflected in the eyes - it's not the only or the first one that would always appear, but it's one of the easiest to notice - after all, who's to say that someone's haird colour (or lack of hair) changed due to random magical influence and not genetics, age or paint?

Dumbledore twinkles, Grindelwald has got magically induced heterochromia, and Voldemort's got red eyes.

** I read a few fics that mentioned his eyes turning red for either one of the two reasons:

- They were the result of dark magic that allowed him to enhance his vision/legilimency/view of magic;

- They were a deformity resulting from other dark magic he cast on himself. At the first, they would only show up when he'd experience an evil feeling (for example greed or lust when Heptzibah shows him the founders' artefacts), but as he gradually gets more and more corrupted by dark magic, he feels evil feelings constantly and that's why we see him with red eyes for the entire series.

My personal headcanon is consistent with the first theory.

** Same reason why some Dark Harrys have eyes that glow killing curse green. It looks cool and intimidating. As megamind said it so well, the difference between a regular villain and a super one is presentation. The main villain shouldn't look like a regular criminal.
