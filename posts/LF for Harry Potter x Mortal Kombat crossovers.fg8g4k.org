Recently I've been getting back into Mortal Kombat and I want to see how the fandom communities will handle the characters. I'd prefer a completed, medium to long story, with the new gen characters, like Cassie Cage, Jacquie Briggs, etc etc. If any of those criteria aren't met, it's fine, as long as the fic isn't being regularly updated and is abandoned, I can't stand those type of stories.


** Dumbledore will shot on every single opponent with a flick of his wrist. This isn't hyperbole. It was literally in the fifth book, in the invasion of the ministry.

A flick of his wand and nearly a dozen death eaters were jailed up and covered in ropes. I think. I can't remember.

And that firestorm spell... Man, those witches and sorcerers' for nothing on that.

*** True, but the fandom does a good job sometimes of changing characters to fit a narrative, I just wanna see what they've done, they don't necessarily even have to fight in the tournaments. Also, do you mean fiendfyre when you say firestorm spell?
