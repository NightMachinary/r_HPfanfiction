And I don't mean obvious stuff like parking fines and other road laws and rules.


** Drug crimes. Mind-altering potions are basically the magical equivalent of drugs, and there don't seem to be any laws against them.

Libel/slander. Not actually a crime in the muggle world, just a civil issue, but in canon, it seems like newspapers are pretty much allowed to print whatever they want--no one ever suggests that Rita Skeeter might be sued for libel.

**** Are gossip rags able to be sued for libel? Libel isn't just about lying - the lie must be damaging to your reputation. Considering gossip rags have built a reputation to be nonsense, you might be hard pressed to prove that enough people believed it that people's perception of you has changed.

If a respectable (and in the case of the Wizarding work, practically only) newspaper makes shit up, however, it's a different story entirely. Yet no one ever talks about suing Skeeter. Or anyone else, actually.

Maybe the Wizarding World doesn't have civil courts at all?

***** It's not the quality of the newspaper that matters, it's whether the person being written about is a public figure. So, Rita could mostly write whatever she wanted about Dumbledore, but in a world with libel laws, her stories about Hermione would definitely be libelous. Even a gossip rag in the muggle world wouldn't be allowed to make up stories about some random teenager's love life.

***** Headcanon: Hermione is well aware that she could sue Rita, but that would be admitting that Ron had a point when he said that she'd made her out to be some kind of 'scarlet woman.'

So she resorts to kidnapping and extortion instead. It's really the lesser evil, when you think about it.

*** I don't think you can apparate international distances, floo network is national only, international portkeys are regulated. The only travel method that could be used to sneak across borders is brooms, and they're quite slow compared to jets. Wizards who want to sneak across borders would probably be best off with using magic to get through muggle security at the airport.

Portkeys need to be registered but Canon shows they can't actually track it or Voldemort would've had a really nasty surprise in Little Hangleton.

The only properly regulated thing is the floo.

IIRC even apparition license is useless if you can do the process correctly, as there is little chance someone would actually check unless you splinch yourself and need medical attention

***** I suppose it depends on how much material outside of the book series you take as canon, but I saw it more as you /can/ apparate long distances (provided you have the power to do so) but it's so ludicrously complicated/dangerous to do it that it's much better to just get a portkey and let the people whose entire job it is to make those computations to do it for you (adjusting the angle you are standing at, accelerating/decelerating to match the rotational speed of the Earth at that location, adjusting for air pressure changes caused by changes in altitude, etc.)

****** Oh you most definitely can, but from what we see in canon you need to visualise where you're going quite clearly and difficulty increases with distance. Now, having that in mind, it probably would be a piece of cake to apparate from, say, London to Hogsmeade for most Hogwarts alumni, but the reverse might not necessarily be true because not everyone knows a place in London well enough to get the Destination part of 3 Ds right.

As for the rest of stuff you talk about - I think it's down to how those magics are used - if you fail a portkey spell you don't go anywhere because you have no portkey. However if you can apparate yet botch an apparition you end up in pieces. Pretty good motivator not to overdo that particular magic

**** To be honest I think that crossing a border would be terribly easy.

Just apparate to the border and then hop over. Either by apparating again or by using a broom once you're close, supposing actual apparition *trough* a border is monitored.

The HPverse *might* subscirbe to the 'large bodies of water' caveat. Iirc in fantasy water and/or flowing water is sort of a natural defense. So leaving Britain by apparition *might* be trickier, but that has more to do with it being Britain rather than international apparition being an issue universally.

Close enough. It's the psychology of the criminals that is interesting. For a human to consider doing something like torture, rape or murder to another human they need to have at least a few screws loose. Sure, laws have changed many times- some things that were illegal are now legal and vice versa. But even ancient societies had laws about murder and theft at least. (Though how successfully they were enforced is another topic altogether.) Which clearly shows that crime is not only a British or muggle or male problem. It's a human one that has existed for centuries in every culture.

******* We're not discussing like, crimes against humanity, we're discussing things like jaywalking and selling drugs, which were only made illegal in response to specific problems that are unique to cultures that have things like roads and drugs. And we're not discussing the general concept of crime, but specific examples. Like do you think every culture everywhere has laws against transportation of dragons across state lines or using truth serum on a minor?
