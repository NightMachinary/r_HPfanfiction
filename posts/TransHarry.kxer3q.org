:END:
I remember reading a fic about Harry slowly discovering that he (or ratzer she) is trans and Hermione starts helping him transition into a girl. And Ron doesn't like and so on and so forth? Oh and I think fem!Harry later gets into a relationship with Severus... Anyone know what's it called?


** The best trans!Harry story I know about is “Magical Metamorphosis by Eon the Dragon Mage” linkffn(12507814), but I don't think it turns into Snarry.
