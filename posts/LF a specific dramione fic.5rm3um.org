I have only read the very beginning of this fic, almost 5 years ago or even longer than that. For some reason I stopped reading it but it stuck with me after all these years.

Post-war, rebuilding Hogwarts type, the Malfoy family was disgraced and had all their assets confiscated by the ministry.

The only scene I remember is Hermione seeing Draco Malfoy trying to order bottled water in Diagon Alley, but upon discovering that he didn't have enough money, he had to settle for tap water instead.

Would love it if someone can tell me the name of fic, just so I could get it out of my mind. Thanks!
