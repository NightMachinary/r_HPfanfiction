I really hate the way a lot of fics seem to write her as a super smart super diligent super beautiful super perfect mary sue thing that always knows what's best so I'm looking for fics that do the opposite.


** The lack of a hyphen in the phrase "Hermione hating" completely changes the meaning of your title.

"Hermione hating main characters" means that Hermione hates the main characters.

"Hermione-hating main characters" means that the main characters hate Hermione.

**** For a long time, I've been wanting to see a one-shot where Hermione ends up actively disliking Harry and Ron.

It doesn't even have to be anybody's fault. For example, suppose that on Halloween 1991, unbeknownst to Harry and Ron, she wanders back to Gryffindor Tower shortly before Quirrel lets the troll in, so all she sees is that Harry and Ron went after a troll and lost lots of House Points (with no McGonagall reversing Snape's penalties, because it was just Harry and Ron being caught sneaking off and endangering themselves). Thus, despite being everybody's best intentions, not only is she not friends with Harry and Ron, she is actually angry at them over what she feels is a betrayal (because she thought that they were friends, and then Ron called her "nightmare"), not to mention annoyed at them for getting themselves (and, sometimes, her) into trouble. She refocuses on her own studies, much more reluctant to help others; if she hangs out with anyone, it's the Ravenclaws, or maybe Percy.

In a funny way, she actually becomes more popular than them in Gryffindor, after Harry, Ron, and Hermione's Replacement (HR) get caught after smuggling a dragon: between Harry's Quiddich victories, and Hermione's relentless pursuit of House Points, Gryffindor actually had a shot at the cup, but then Harry, Ron, and HR went and lost 150 points in one night, /and they are refusing to tell anyone why/.

So, when eight months later, Harry, Ron, and HR, having somehow solved the Philosopher's Stone mystery without Hermione, prepare to go after the Philosopher's Stone, they run into her (as they had into Neville in canon), and she is sick and tired of them getting into trouble and pissing away the House Points she earns through hard work, and she isn't going to take it any more, she doesn't buy their ridiculous conspiracy theory about Snape, and they aren't going off on yet another ridiculous adventure if she has anything to say about it. She knows the /Petrificus Totalus/ jinx, and she's not afraid to use it...

And so, Hermione Granger dooms the world through an excess of competence and common sense. (Or, alternatively, Hermione Granger delays Voldemort's return indefinitely due to Dumbledore's trap working as intended. I like the first version for irony value.)

***** She might not even doom it. The philosopher's stone grants you immortality, but it is not a "one use, immortality forever"-item.

So, now people need to fight to remove this item from Voldemort and THEN figure out about the horcruxes. It is possible to defeat this doubly protected evil, but it won't be a fun ride.

I like this, because with one action the "Stations of Canon" are completely and utterly destroyed.

*** Not necessarily. It could be a story with unreliable narrators with whom one is not supposed to sympathize, like Hemingway's /The Sun Also Rises/ or Nabokov's /Lolita/.

For that matter, pretty much any story with in-character Draco and/or Pansy as the main characters, that's not a Dramione 'ship (but I repeat myself) would fit the bill.

**** And most of the rest of her stuff paints her as a pain in the ass who doesn't really listen to the opinions of others. From the few real-life Hermiones I've known, that's pretty damn accurate.

  AU. Harry is shunned not only Ron, but Hermione as well after the Goblet of Fire incident. Ginny befriends Harry and history changes. Future Dark!Harry Dark!Ginny pairing, extended summary inside. Note from 2012: I'm not a huge fan of this story now, but leaving it up for historical purposes for those who do enjoy it.

** I love bashing Hermione. She's unbearable even in canon, and seeing how fanfic writers can really muck her up makes for pleasurable reading.

In almost all of the Harry/Voldemort fics I've read, Hermione has in some way been bashed to hell, and she and Harry(whether he goes by Harry or [name] Riddle) usually hate each other's guts.
