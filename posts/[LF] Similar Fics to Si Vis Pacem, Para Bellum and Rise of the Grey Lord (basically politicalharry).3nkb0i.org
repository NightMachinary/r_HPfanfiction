Liked all of Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum Liked all of Rise of the Grey Lord except canon-Harry changing to current Harry.


** linkffn(7539141) Despite ostensibly being a zombie fic, it's largely filled with interesting Wizengamot politics

  A year has passed since the dead started returning to life. The fate of those hoping to survive and rebuild rests on the best and the worst of humanity, both wizards and Muggles, with their political ideologies and the ravenous undead in between, and it's up to Healer Harry Potter to save as many as he can in the crossfire. A Harry Potter Zombie Apocalypse Fanfiction. HP/AG.

** linkffn(Emperor by Marquis Black) features a Harry who wishes to overthrow the wizarding government and bring them under his(muggle)rule

linkffn(Rise of the Wizards) features politics in the later half (I think after chapters 31ish)

linkffn(Midnight Gold, The Rise of The Forgotten Lord) this one has a lot of focus on politics throughout the story

** Fair warning: the fic I'm linking is abandoned beyond abandonment. Still, though, I remember that I really liked how it was being set up and there was a ton of potential in Harry having Dumbledore's memory and some aspects of his power/personality.

Particularly riveting was Harrydore's Moment of Awesome in Ch5, when he monologues about the myriad ways magic could overcome whatever offense/defense muggles could bring to bear against the Magical World (I'd seen so many fics around that time of Harry grabbing guns and muggle armies and basically owning Voldemort and the DEs, so it was nice also seeing the potency of magic not be dismissed outright).
