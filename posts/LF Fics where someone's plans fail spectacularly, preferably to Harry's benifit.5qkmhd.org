Either the dementors 5th year lead to Umbridge and Fudge getting sacked, or Dumbledore's evil master plan first year grants Harry an endless supply of gold and immortality juice, or Ron's plot to befriend Harry exposes just how evil and traitorous the Weasleys truly are (except the twins of course because they're everyone's favorite characters). You know, the usual.

Slash, bashing, Dark!Harry, Dark!Harry's allies and crossovers are fine. Please no smut/romance driven plot, genderbending, mpreg or pottercest. Thank you!

It was chapter 33 of Goblet of Fire. Voldemort and his Death Eaters were gathered in the Little Hangleton graveyard, to bear witness to the former's resurrection and Harry Potter's certain, definite, absolute, he's-going-to-get-it-this-time-for-sure demise.

Except that Harry Potter /wasn't/ dead. He had been Crucio'd, Avada Kedavra'd, Fiendfyre'd, frozen, electrified, crushed by giant stone fists, Finite Incantatem'd, and poisoned, and he was standing there looking no worse for wear, with a raised eyebrow.

Nagini had tried strangling and biting him, Wormtail tried to strangle him and stab him, several of the Death Eaters had tried running him through with various weapons or tearing him apart with conjured animals, a passing Dementor gave him a Kiss, and the ghost of Cedric Diggory...tried a bad knock-knock joke.

None of it worked. Harry just kept standing there, the physical, mental and spiritual damage to him fading away like they had never happened, making everyone present feel somewhat uncomfortable.

Voldemort's composure cracked, "Okay, seriously, what the FUCK. I know he's supposed to be the Boy-Who-Lived, but this is effing ridiculous! Why is Harry Potter invincible? Can someone tell me why he's invincible?"

Another silence...then a single Death Eater, wearing an obnoxiously nerdy pair of spectacles over his mask, stepped forward, "I, erm, I might have a hypothesis, my lord..."

Voldemort waved his hand impatiently; the nerdy Death Eater took a deep breath and continued, "This is a long shot, but seeing as you took his blood, and he now shares a link to you, it's entirely possible that whatever protection his mother provided him, is now letting him use your Hor-"

"Shush! Those haven't been introduced in the plot yet!" Voldemort admonished him.

The Nerd Eater gulped, before amending himself, "-Letting him use your /secret to immortality/ to disperse the 'energy' of any injury coming his way, or failing that, draw energy across a wide area to instantaneously heal damage."

There was a pause, then Voldemort snorted, "That's ridiculous. Love-based protection is hostile to Hor-/immortality/ type dark magic. Foul's Law of Compatability, '98. You'd need phoenix tears or some other super-stuff to neutralize residuals and prevent annihilation."

"Uh, I had a vial of phoenix tears for the third task. Last I saw, Wormtail had them." Harry offered helpfully.

Everyone, conjured animals, ghosts, and dementors included, turned to look at a suddenly sheepish Wormtail.

"I, uh, put them in the potion. I thought it'd make your body stronger, milord..." he waved weakly.

Voldemort sighed, and facepalmed. "This is great. My prophesied archnemesis is literally completely fucking invulnerable. What the hell do we do now?"

"There's a prophecy about me?" Harry asked curiously.

"/Silencio. Incarcerous./" Voldemort waved his wand lazily at Harry, before turning his attention back to the Death Eaters, "No matter...we can keep this /nuisance/ contained. Conquering the w-"

"Whoooop!"

Voldemort suddenly twisted around; the ropes conjured by Incarcerous had fallen to the ground, and he could see a Boy-Who-Lived figure high-tailing it out of the graveyard.

The obvious course of action was obvious.

"STOP HIM!" the Dark Lord yelled, "I want him alive...wait, no, I want him dead, I really want him dead."

He sighed and wiped his brow as the Death Eaters took off en-masse after the Runaway-Boy-Who-Lived.

  What would have happened if Harry had been convicted by the Wizengamot after defending himself from dementors before his fifth year at Hogwarts? Humorous! Followup stories on Sirius Black plus Cornelius Fudge's attempt at becoming a dark lord.

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.

** not exactly what you had in mind (its a H/HR romance, but you can easily skip forward in those bits), but this does feature plotting by villains that actually sorta work, but possibly in the long term benefit of HP. Spoiler: its sort of a dimension / time travel fic, where SS bumped of a JP that survived 10/31, and then married Lily. So HP gets a living mom and a half-sister out of the deal. I also think its sort of a weirdly forgotten story, with fewer than 500 favs & reviews, despite being 9 years old.

  Our lives are not our own. Fate is set, choice is meaningless and the mark of the chosen never truly fades. When Harry finds a way to change his destiny, will the result be better than the path already chosen for him? HP/HG Sequel posted.
