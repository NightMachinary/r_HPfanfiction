** Yes, they do, but what they don't have is an issue defending against nukes.

Remember that magic overrides the mundane; a shield charm can defend against a nuclear explosion. Magic is conceptual. Shield charms defend against harm; radiation is harm. Even if shield charms did not protect against radiation, I doubt radiation would be threat from JKR's quote on mundane health issues. Wizards can "comfortably survive" venom, a chemical threat.

Before someone brings up "energy", which one would think would be foolish in a story where souls are real, look up the energy involved in conjuration.

So, the real threat is that muggles might be killed off en masse which could be inconvenient for wizards. The ICW would politely send aurors after said wizard. Then again, for all the reading the wizard supposedly did, he'd probably have raid some more pertinent magical textbooks and picked a better plan.

Edit: Also, another note that it is far harder to develop nuclear weapons than people think. Even with the theoretically correct calculations and design, you still have to test, refine the hiccups that come up, and much more. There's a reason why many countries /don't/ have nuclear weapons.

**** No but it's certainly possible to charm districts, homes, and people. At the end of the day, wizards are just going to be dealing with a very ugly view out of their windows.

Plus, there are national level enchantments such as the taboo, trace, and some spells capable of working at space levels. I wouldn't be surprised if there was magic that could cover the entire world in shield charms.

** 1.Even easier method. Establish a logistics company.

1. Arrange vanishing cabinets around the world in strategic places like two in europe, one in middle east, india, china, australia and two in Africa, South America and North America.

2. That's way faster, cheap and easier to transport intercontinental.

3. And provide international shipping services. That's way faster and almost legal.

4. You can also smuggle drugs, explosives, guns and other illegal items if you want more money.

** If I had magic, that's what I would do. But after a while people would start to wonder how you deliver so fast without planes or trucks.
