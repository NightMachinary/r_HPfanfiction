** This was an AMAZING series (there are two parts). Definitely my fave of Harry in Slytherin. This author writes Slytherin really well and Harry ends up being happy here. “A Learning Experience” by Margot11.

  How would things have been if Harry had got to know Snape and his Snakes better? A 'Harry in Slytherin' story. Don't groan; it's not that bad! Warnings: mention of sex later on (very mild); typical teenage swearing (mild) and corporal punishment (not graphic or extreme). (Note: the beginning is heavily inspired by Asterix Tutnix.)

** Linkao3(Leo Inter Serpentes: First Year)

That's a pretty good series, it goes first year through seventh, with the seventh year posting now.

I'm also writing a Slytherin Harry series where it's about a female Harry with selective mutism.

  A retelling of the original series, but this time, our hero wears green and silver, not red and gold.

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.

  When kids in the Slytherin Common Room tossed jeers at the pudgy feet of Millicent Bulstrode, Harry rose up to do something about it. This Harry, now one of Snape's own, got fewer House points lost but many more detentions-- it had never been the colors on his hem that Severus hated.This was not wishing Harry an easy path. This was not wishing the boy a warm House. This was Harry, three weeks in, sleep deprived and considering running away and going back to Privet Drive. This was Harry in the back of Potions class, blank-faced under Snape's disdain the way he'd perfected under the Dursleys's torments.When Quirrell shouted “troll in the dungeons, thought you ought to know,” and Harry overheard that there was a girl in the bathroom crying, he still ran off to make sure she got out okay. He hesitated first, at the back of the little pack of Slytherin first years (at the back so that no one could get behind him)-- he hesitated. And Millicent Bulstrode, who could never quite keep her tummy tucked in enough, could never brush all the cat hair off her robes, never quite keep her temper in check, hesitated, too.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. AU world with a canonical tone. No canon rehash, no bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. Second Year complete as of Chapter 27.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.
