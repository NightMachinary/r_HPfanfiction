Ideally without special knowedge. And having it kicks things up /causes complications.

Daphne Greengrass travels back to her first year. Of course, she tells Dumbledore (or her father) about all the events of her past life. Like the monster that attacks and gets Dumbledore removed in her second year (but she doesn't know it was a basalisk or about horocruxes). Or Voldemort came back in her fourth year by kidnapping Harry but not knowing the details of behind the scenes like the world cup and Crouch.

Or Percy Weasley going back and trying to save his sister from her possession but not knowing about Sirius due to not being a part of the Order.

Professor Flitwick goes back and tries to protect the students from all the disasters but doesn't know the true stories behind them so accidently gets Hogwarts shut down.

Etc.


** Crossing Lines linkffn(11993367)

Fred and George's attempt to get past the age line in GOF sends them back to marauders era. Their incorrect information (at this point they still believe Sirius is a traitor and Peter's the hero) help contribute to creating a stable time loop. For example:>! After the twins are interrogated by Snape, Snape learns that he does not become a Death Eater and Lily dies on Halloween 1981, so Snape becomes a Death Eater to try and prevent Lily's death.!<

  Taking an aging potion was Fred and George Weasley's backup plan for getting past Dumbledore's age line in GoF. Their initial idea, though... Well, finding themselves 18 years in the past was not part of the plan. Marauders era. No bashing.

** The only did that I know of off the top of my head is !linkffn(under the veil) where Sirius and an carry on is thrust into the end of third year, Sirius has no clue about horcruxes, although due to plot (& remus) they find the locket pretty quick. Canon divergence as of the third chapter, and involvement of a non-daphne slytherin that is Cassius Warrington. It focuses 9n the perspective of a Sirius Black and Sans "Ian" Skelton, as they infiltrate Hogwarts, hunt down a yet unknown number of horcuxes, and slay Voldemort.

Pretty good fic, avoids tropes and common failings of both fandoms.

No bashing, a powerful sans, but with some crippling restrictions, a promising side plot, and in-charactrr interactions.

  Sans has gotten himself stuck in the void between worlds in a successful attempt to stop the resets of his timeline. He's not sure how long he's been chillin' alone there, but eventually a chance at escape stumbles his way in from the Veil of Death. His name?---Sirius Black. (no pairings)

This one's not told from the point of view of the time-travelers though. And, maybe it's just me, this was a little darker than I was expecting.

  At the beginning of an already hectic third year, thirteen year old Hermione Granger is wrenched back in time to 1973 after an accident with her time turner. But if Sirius Black grows up to be a mass murderer, why does Hermione find herself so drawn to him? And why does Peter Pettigrew make her so uneasy? Eventual SBHG. Very slow burn. Now rated 'M'.
