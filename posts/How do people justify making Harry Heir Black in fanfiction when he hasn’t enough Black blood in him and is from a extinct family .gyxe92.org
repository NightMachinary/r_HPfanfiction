How do people justify making Harry Heir Black in fanfiction when he hasn't enough Black blood in him and is from a extinct family ? How do they justify making the Godfather bond into something more that it is really ? How do they justify the gap between what godfather bond is really a wardship and the bond of blood ?


** You seem to be making up a lot of non-canon rules of inheritance.

In the books, Sirius can leave his property to anyone he likes. He chooses to leave it to Harry. Simple.

******** 1. There's no reason why Muggle rules would apply to the wizarding world.

2. In any event, there is no such rule of inheritance in (Muggle) English law that people with titles of nobility cannot "bequeath outside of the blood".

The closest thing Muggle law has to your proposal is the "fee tail", which was used to keep estates in tact. This form of property was abolished in 1925, however.

**** That's quite easy, just make Harry's grandparents to be Charlus and Dorea instead of Fleamont and Euphemia(completely doable since their names are not in the books and only came out later in Pottermore IIRC) then make the Headship of the family's rules of heirship flexible to the current Head/Lord, following that they have to have the bloodline.

Then Sirius designates Harry as Heir, maybe even adopt him, or maybe make the godfather bond enough to be considered paternal in certain cases.

BAM! Done, you can even have Sirius cast out Narcissa and Draco so the nearest eligible male to inherit is Harry through his grandmother.

Or just make all that AND the Family Magic/Totem/Guardian recognize Harry over Draco, because Harry is powerful/has the Black interests in mind/looks cooler

Done.

I honestly don't see the problem here.

They don't need to publish a whole family tree and family charter. Not everyone is GRRM.

By doing that the fic in internally consistent which seems to be what you are asking, since inheritance laws can vary wildly and the author can just imply they work by the Ministry accepting it.

******** It doesn't matter how far in the past it is it matters in which line of the succession it is. If lucretia Black had any grandchildren the Black "lordship" would go to those grandchildren even though those grandchildren are first cousins once removed (just like Draco) because they are in the primary line of succession.

The specific line of succession holds precedence over family relationship. Eg without a will a second cousin in the primary line would inherit before a second cousin from a secondary line.

********** First I was using it as an example of cousins and lines of succession. Lucrecia had no descendants so there was no possibility of her descendants inheriting. And I'll agree that as the oldest and assuming women are on even basis which I have then without designated wills/heirs her family must be extinct in order for Sirius to have inherited. It's a different story if wills and designated heirs exist then if she did have family they could be alive to inherit.

Second as far as I know "Orion didn't inherit" as Arcturus was still alive way after Orion died (in fact he lived passed Walburga as well).

You're missing a few. (And this is without considering anyone's reinstatement, any designated heirs eg no wills exist, etc, also just going by oldest child).

Callidora Longbottom nee black (still living) would be the head of the family. She had one son and one daughter so when she passed it would go through those descendants.

If they are extinct it would then go to Charis Crouch nee Black she had one son and two daughters and all their descendants.

Then if that line has gone extinct it would go through Belvina Burke nee Black. She had 2 sons and a daughter so all their descendants would be next in line.

Only if all of the others are dead (which at the time of Sirius' death we know they are living members of those lines) would the succession fall to Cygnus and his descendants. And at that point it would fall to Bellatrix Lestrange nee Black and then with their deaths it would fall to Narcissa Malfoy nee Black and then Draco.

What we don't know and can't say is where Harry and his family would if at all connect into the Black family. So we don't know if in a world without wills designating heirs would Harry appear in the Black Family line of succession prior to Draco.

However, since canon does have wills designating heirs, and we are told that he is related to the black family (but not exactly how) we know that Harry can become head of the Black family.

************ The difference with what I posted is that I believe that Sirius is the legitimate head of the Black Family and as such he could designate his Heir. And that from canon we know Harry has some Black Blood in him (though we don't know the "amount"). Therefore, that Harry now is the legitimate head of the family Black.

And if that heir designation did not exist the "headship or lordship" of the Black Family would never fall to Draco as there are lots of people ahead of him in the succession.

And depending on how Euphemia or Fleamont or the Evans plug into the Black family Harry could be Higher in the succession then Draco (though it's doubtful it would fall to Harry as he would also have a lot of folks in front of him). About the only way it would go to Harry is if somehow Euphemia is either the eldest child of Callidora or the daughter of the eldest child (which would entail a lot of young parents to make the ages work (definitely doable)).

************* It is my belief that there are not any ties between the Potter and Blacks save Dorea and Charles because it is explained in canon that Dorea was near being disown that the family did not take it kindly for her to weed a Potter, a family that is not considered pure or not within the Pureblood Registry. The Evans are believed entirely muggle so they have never been taken into account.

You know you could just say that my analysis of the family tree was correct and say that I was wrong only with the belief that Sirius was disowned and forgotten asomeone from the Tree without having to list yourself the members to the succession .

There is only a mystery in the relationship between Harry and Charles, there are both Potter so it would fall to reason that there must be somewhere a common ancestor. Even if Charlie was from a cadet branch like the Potter that has gone to found the American MACUSA.

************** True but in my defense or blame (eg old detail oriented (some might say anal) computer engineer) I actually don't agree that you're analysis is correct). I also believe there is a lot of mystery remaining. We have a very limited look into Fleamont's family with no idea how he may be related to Charles let alone to any other pureblood families. We have no idea who Euphemia is related to. Hell we don't even know her maiden name. That's a huge mystery.

Canon states they are related we just don't know how.

On the Evans the question that arises is how do muggleborns occur? It defies logic and genetics that in a limited population within the UK that tens to hundreds of muggleborns with no magic in their family trees are suddenly born every year. Now we could just claim "magic" but that's just not satisfying.

I side with the fanfiction authors who develop a plotline that all muggleborns descended from squibs. That's how the magic gene gets in them and then somehow becomes active. Which means we really need a "full" tree for the Evans line. And the black family tree needs to be completed as we have no idea about Belvina, Callidora, and Charis' descendants.

I have cited Callidora and Belvina but not Charis, I have forgotten Charis. On another point Canon doesn't state that Harry Potter and the Blacks are related, it just mentions in Ootp, that Charles Potter married Dorea Black but it doesn't tell the relationship between Charles and Harry so Charles could be from a cadet branch with only a common ancestor when the family has branched. So I think we can say that there is only one tie between the Potters and the Black in Dorea Black. Nor Canon nor Rowling said any different.

But finally I agree that if that hypothesis that Dorea was the first marriage between a Potter and a Black is wrong then with the fact that the family tree that we have are incomplete, there is the same possibility that ties exist like Hermione said for the probability of Salazar Slytherin being a ancestor of Harry Potter as he lived in the far past.

** Very simply because Euphemia wasn't identified (via Pottermore) as the name of Harry Potter's grandmother until after many of the Books had already been published. Which means much of the fanfiction community believed/used Dorea Potter nee Black to connect Harry to the Black line. Because as was stated in the books to some extent all pureblood families are related.

Secondly, Sirius as the Head of House Black has the authority to designate who he wants to inherit. It's only when there is no designated Heir that various rules of inheritance apply. And in fanfiction (which is always AU) the Author decides what "rules of inheritance" they wish to follow as well as "who are Harry's grandparents".

And thirdly the godfather bond is what the parents of the child makes of it. IRL I am the godfather to the children of three different families. If the worst was to happen (god forbid) in two of the families very little would change. In the third, I would take over raising the children as that's what the parents put into place.

So it's up to the authors to decide what the godfather bond entails. Even canon suggests that harry should have gone to Sirius. But like many things it wasn't clearly detailed/identified.

*** Firstly I am asking about those fanfics that do it and use Euphemia as Harry paternal grandmother. I am well aware that with Dorea it is logical for Harry to be Heir Black in concurrence with Draco with the same family relationship.

Secondly Sirius would be restricted from designating a Heir outside of the family if there is an heir apparent as Draco is.

Thirdly the Godfather bond is no adoption so it as no relevance within inheritance. One cannot use it as a reason to bequeath as it was within family.

**** Draco is not the Heir apparent unless he was designated by Sirius as such and he wasn't. In addition if you're trying to push the Heir apparent through blood idea, Draco is descended from the 4th child/line of Phineas Black (and at one time Head of house Black) and therefore would not inherit (unless designated in a will) until all the descendants from the primary line (which Sirius descended from), secondary, and tertiary lines are gone. And according to the Black family tapestry, there are still living descendants of the second and third lines around. So Draco is not in the running for the Head of house Black via blood unless he was designated as such via a will.

Also, Draco wouldn't be the first individual bypassed in an inheritance because the Head decided to "give it" to someone with a lesser blood connection. That's true in real world as well ass fanfiction. Again it's the Author who decides how an inheritance goes.

Finally the books state that Harry is related to Sirius. And in the books Sirius was able to pass his inheritance on to Harry therefore there was enough "black Blood" in Harry in order for that to occur otherwise Kreacher would not have obeyed Harry as Head of the house (which is canon).

You're other problem is there is no 100% complete family tree so we don't know if or how Euphemia or Fleamont are related to anyone as we have little info on them.

****** First off you seem to be ignoring the fact that a "Lord" can designate anyone as a heir including those with a "lessor" blood connection. And that a "Lordship" would first fall to the designated Heir before it would follow any other rules of inheritance. It's only when there is no designated Heir that any "rules of Inheritance" would apply. And Draco was never designated as the "Black heir". Also that in the Wizarding world that Women can inherit.

Draco being a "second" cousin to Sirius (through his mother) means nothing if your relationship is not part of the same line. You also can't say that the family relationship between Draco and Sirius is the same as Harry and Sirius as Harry's family tree has not been fleshed out so we truly don't know how they are related.

If the Lordship or Headship of the family descends from Phineas Nigellus Black then when Sirius dies the primary line is extinct. It would then go to the secondary line (now that individual was disowned however the possibility exists that they could be reinstated by the current lord) it would not go to some second cousin in the fifth line (ie Draco).

Therefore, if an Heir was not designated by the current primary line it would then go to the secondary line (disinherited). After that it would go to the tertiary line Arcturus and his descendants still living. If that line was extinct it would go through the 4th line Belvina Burke nee Black and her descendants. Only if her line is extinct would it then go through the 5th line Cygnus and finally reach Draco. And that's only if Andromeda is not reinstated.

Now we know that Harry was the designated Heir. What we can't say with any authority is whether or not without that designation Harry would inherit the "Black Lordship" before Draco as we don't know how Harry may be related to the Black family as neither his paternal nor maternal family trees have been fleshed out.

******* My argument is Harry designation as Heir Black is invalid as Sirius Black was disowned and so he cannot be Lord Black, so the inheritance laws are used. So logically Burkhe, Lestrange or Malfoy for the relationship as depicted in the family tree. Canon Harry has no black ties know, so his designation as Black Heir is only Sirius Orion Black Will, and so can be contested if he was disowned.

******** You're either ignoring information or just missing it but either way you're wrong. Arcturus Black, Orion Black's father (Sirius Black's grandfather) was head of the Black family (and there is no information that he ever passed this authority to Orion). Therefore only Arcturus can truly disinherit Sirius from the Black Family succession. There is no indication that Arcturus did so. And since Arcturus was still alive when Walburga passed he would determine whether Sirius was a valid heir.

Since we have no indication in canon that Arcturus as the head of the Black disowned Sirius whatever Walburga did had not impact on the actual lines of succession. Eg Walburga had no authority to remove Sirius from the line of succession as she was never the head of the family. She could easily say he's not her son but if Arcturus did not ratify it would not impact Sirius' ability to become the Head of the family.

Therefore Sirius' designation of heir would stand.

The question is What does that mean? What did it mean when the house was first founded? That's a question we don't know the answer to. Was it the bigots in the house starting with Phineas' father etc that started the family to look at the motto as "always pure in blood" versus something like "always pure in heart" etc.

***************** Which weapons? Which guardianship?

It appears you are debating based on /your/ headcannon.

We don't know anything about wizardkind guardianship laws, all we know is from the Hogsmeade authorization paper and that is that you need a guardian to sign them or the Minister or some other official to waive the need away(Fudge basically did that, he didn't sign as his guardian he just authorized a kid to go on a very safe school trip).

Malfoy was persona non grata right after Voldemort fell, it would take some years for him to climb back up. Him trying to take the boy who lived would be seen as a Death Eater trying for revenge.

Harry was then placed with his closest blood relatives, the Dursleys and they are recognized as his guardians(since their signature would be accepted in the Hogsmeade paper) and that's it.

We don't know anything about Potter assets, maybe all that was left was in Harry's trust vault, we know from post-book material they had a manor and the house at Godric's Hollow, but JKR probably forgot about those because they weren't important for the overall plot. For all we know, whatever assets were frozen until the heir came of age.

Again, the same thing you do in using a little bit of canon and a whole lot of headcanon could be used the other way to say that Dumbledore has more people in the Wizengamot that would overrule Malfoy, or that Malfoy wouldn't want to go against Dumbledore so openly. Or that maybe this was all done behind closed Doors and Malfoy wouldn't know about it since they had no claim to any Black Fortune since they were from an unimportant matrilineal branch and so when the heir leaves a clear will they have no recourse.

**** The Dursleys are the only living family harry has on his mother's side. That tells us nothing about whether or not he is a related/distant cousin to the Black family.

For one thing we don't even know Euphemia's maiden name so for all we know Euphemia is related to Belvina Black via the two sons and daughter she had which would put Harry in the third line of Phineas Black. Or she could be related to Callidora Black or one of her other sisters due to their children (who are never named) which would put Harry in the second line of Phineas Black. Hell we only know when Euphemia died not when she was born.

Then there's the whole Evans family which we know little about. Could one of them be descended from a Black squib? We don't know as their family tree has never been fully detailed.

So you have no way of determining whether harry has any connection to the Black Family because neither side of his family tree has been fully fleshed out. So all we are left with is the canon details that say he is somehow related and the fact that Kreacher obeyed him which meant that Kreacher saw him as the "rightful" Black.

This overall lack of detail in canon allows the fanfiction authors enough flexibility to designate Harry as "lord Black" in their stories via the simple tie of Sirius' will in Canon.

And because of the lack of detail concerning Euphemia and Fleamont's birth and relatives (and then the same lack of detail in the Evans family) no one can authoritatively say that Harry has no Black Blood in them and therefore could not possibly be "Lord Black".

But the opposite is true. Eg that Harry can be "Lord Black, because all a fanfiction author has to do is point out that canon had Harry inherit from Sirius and afterwards Kreacher obeyed him.
