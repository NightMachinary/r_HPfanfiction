I'm looking for any fully completed stories where harry is raised by the dark lord or mentored by him, because of his power. I always find stories like this that are completed, but only as part of a series. I'm sick of finding these little gems, and when i get a good bit into it i see It is technially incomplete, and it just ruins the story for me.

So in conclusion a complete harry raised by voldermort story or harry mentored by voldermort also with harry having more power that the average witch or wizard.


** The Darkness Within by Kurinoone would be a good fit. One of my all time favorite fanfics.

*** How powerful would you rate harry in this story, and are there any tropes i should be expecting. On another note thank-you for the story, you seem to be the only response i've gotten.

  What if Wormtail hadn't told Lord Voldemort the Potters hideout. What if he took Harry straight to him instead? A Dark Harry fanfic. AU Mild HG

*** I totally agree with this. One of the best fics out here. Harry is pretty strong in this one, as he was raised by Voldemort. There's really good character development in this story.
