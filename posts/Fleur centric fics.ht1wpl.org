Hi,

I am looking for well written Fleur centric fics. Could be canon compliant (her POV of the triwizard tournament for example) but do not have to be.

Not so keen on Fleur/Harry romance fics or pure smut. Have tried checking recent posts, but all people are requesting is Fleur/Harry of some sort.

Thanks!
