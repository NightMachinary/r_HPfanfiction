Want to read some fics where there is relatively peaceful in the magic world during Harry's seventh year at Hogwarts and what they get up to. More Apparition lessons, NEWTS etc. Bonus if the fic includes a graduation scene at the end!


** linkffn(Resonance by GreenGecko) definitely has a great deal of what you're looking for, and the trilogy even goes into afterwards and Harry training as an Auror in the same way. Manages to be mundane yet extremely interesting. Of course Harry has some extra adventures along the way!

Fair warnings: It's extremely old (this is a plus in my book, stories written before the last two books tend to be very original and fascinating in their ideas). The beginning is a little clunky. You do have to put up with Harry offing Voldemort in sixth year (how he's able to have a normal seventh!). And last but not least, it is a "Snape adopts Harry", but it's probably the most realistic and very best out there for people who don't like that genre. There's no initialization and there's a ton of non-Snape time.

  From Hogwarts' historic pitch to the famous stadiums of Europe, Harry fights to earn his place amongst the all-time greats. The stakes are high, and sheer talent is never enough. It's more than just a game. A Quidditch story.
