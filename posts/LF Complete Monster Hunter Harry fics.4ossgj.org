Are there any fics where Harry and/or the Golden Trio become monster hunters (Dragons, Vampires, etc), probably after Hogwarts? Kind of like Supernatural?


** I've written a Buffy Crossover where Harry and Hermione join the Watchers, but it's set in their 5th year, so it's not post-Hogwarts. The sequel's planned to be post-Hogwarts though.

*** I just said after Hogwars to mean once they know their stuff. I don't expect 11 year olds to be able to slay dragons. Care to link your story?

** It's not complete, but a fic written by Ginnymylove crosses over with MH several times. Harry's interractions with Qurupeco are amusing as hell. Linkffn(8023885)

  Unfortunately on Hiatus as I have no motivation to continue at the moment. Two mysterious doors have been opened, gateways to the realms of the Gods and the Devils. The Princesses of each show up at Hogwarts pledging to marry Harry Potter. Harem: Crossover with the anime Shuffle! (multicross only includes ideas and settings from other fandoms)
