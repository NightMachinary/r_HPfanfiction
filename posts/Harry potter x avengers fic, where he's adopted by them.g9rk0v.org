Do you guys have any fic recs about Harry being adopted by the Avengers? Preferably by Steve Rogers, but as long as he's raised by the Avengers it's fine. I've read a few, mainly linkao3(Ficception: Darkness of Birth)

linkao3(From Pen-Pals to Family)

linkao3(Foundations)

Thanks!


** This probably too much of a stretch but Spectacular by megamatt09 has Lily being cousins with Peter Parker's Aunt May and Aunt May adopts Harry.

linkffa(1325)

There's a short drabble/story in a plot collection by kevin1984 that has Harry being adopted by Tony Stark

  In his several millennia of existence Loki Odinson, God of Mischief and Lies, had been many things; he had been a liar, a warrior, and a trickster, just to name a few, but never before had he been a loving father, he'd never been given the chance. However, the moment the tiny creature was in his arms, he knew he would do anything necessary to keep hold of what was his.
