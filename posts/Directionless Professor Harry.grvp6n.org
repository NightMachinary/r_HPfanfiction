:END:
Read a fic a while back where Harry didn´t know what do after the war concluded and such, and McGonagall asks him to teach DADA. While there, he mends a bunch if bridges between Gryffs and Slytherins, and hangs out with a lot of war orphans. Over the Yule Break, they play DnD in an abandoned classroom, and continue to do so over the spring term. McGonagall says something along the lines of "Hogwarts will always have a place for you".

I believe it was on [[https://FF.net][FF.net]], but I'm not positive. I seem to remember it being named something like "Hogwarts welcomes you", but I can't find it while searching. It was a semi-long one-shot.

Have a nice evening!


** I've read this! Not sure if it's on FFN or not, but it's on AO3.

  “You understand, Professor,” Harry began, after a moment, “that I don't have my N.E.W.T.s. I never even finished seventh year. Between everything, I never had a chance the first time around, and then afterwards there didn't seem to be much point. Hermione argued for it, of course, but I was so tired of Britain. So technically, I am completely unqualified for the position.” “Quite a way to begin an interview, Mr. Potter,” McGonagall said, dryly. Or, three years after the war, Harry Potter becomes Hogwarts' newest Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.
