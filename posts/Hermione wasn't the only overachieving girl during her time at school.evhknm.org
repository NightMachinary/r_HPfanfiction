I was thinking about the movie Booksmart, the premise of which has a know-it-all nerdy girl get into her dream Ivy, and then she finds out that there are other kids at her school who got into Ivy League colleges as well. Except they weren't as uptight; they partied, had a slutty reputation, etc.

Got me thinking about what would happen if Hermione found out that she may have been top of her year, but that doesn't mean all the other kids were totally slacking off. But it would be especially interesting if one of them were more naturally gifted academically--like they barely studied for their NEWT and got the highest grade recorded in decades. Or, like, Hermione catches them writing a Transfiguration essay two hours before it's due but when she reads it, it's better than what she wrote when she was their age. I'm thinking about using this prompt myself but I am interested to see what other people come up with!


** Oh my goodness THIS PROMPT IS A DREAM. Id write it myself if i had the time. Booksmart + Hermione is a match made in heaven.

** FYI, JK Rowling originally intended to introduce such a character in GoF - Mafalda Weasley.

#+begin_quote
  Mafalda (Goblet of Fire)

  I have spoken before now about the Weasley cousin who made it quite a long way into 'Goblet of Fire' before I cut her. I really liked her as a character and did not want to sacrifice her, but she just wasn't doing the job she was supposed to do so she had to go.

  Mafalda was the daughter of the 'second cousin who's a stockbroker' mentioned in 'Philosopher's Stone'. This stockbroker had been very rude to Mr. and Mrs. Weasley in the past, but now he and his (Muggle) wife had inconveniently produced a witch, they came back to the Weasleys asking for their help in introducing her to wizarding society before she starts at Hogwarts. The Weasleys agreed to taking her for part of the Summer, including the Quidditch World Cup, but regretted this almost immediately. Mrs. Weasley suspected that Mafalda's parents simply wanted to get rid of her for a while, because she turns out to be the most unpleasant child Mrs. Weasley has ever met.

  Mafalda was supposed to convey certain information about the Death Eaters to Harry, Ron and Hermione, because as a nosy, eavesdropping Slytherin who likes to impress, she does not keep her mouth shut when she overhears their sons and daughters talking. Unfortunately, however bright I made her, there were obvious limitations to what an eleven year old closeted at school could discover, whereas Rita Skeeter, whom I subsequently built up to fulfil Mafalda's function, was much more flexible.

  The best thing about Mafalda was that she was a match for Hermione. To the latter's horror, Mafalda was highly gifted and a real show-off, so that Hermione was torn between deploring the rule-breaking and longing to join in and beat her.

*** Mafalda *Prewett*, more likely, since she was Molly's cousin, not Arthur's, at least according to Ron.

It would have been interesting; but I think that Rowling had come up with that character too late, and having meaningful interaction, to say nothing of conflict or competition, between people 3 grades apart would have been a logistical nightmare.

It would have done so much. Made the weasleys not as good, as well as an unlikable muggleborn (or would she be a half blood?), and made another interesting slytherin who is also smart and not a pureblood.

*** “a nosy, eavesdropping Slytherin who likes to impress” - so basically me when I was 11 - shots fired, JKR, lmao.

Now I'm definitely motivated to write a fic on this prompt. Especially because after getting into my dream college, impostor syndrome hit me so hard at age 19. To me, Hermione represents an unrealistic standard that I'll never reach. But I wouldn't want to be me without ADHD.

** Many people had many things to say about Luna Lovegood. She was loony, insane, crazy, weird, not quite right, her wand was twisted, and more the would say. They would never say, that she was of poor breeding, that she came from a poor family, that she wasn't an absolute powerhouse of magic, that she was not the smartest person they had ever met hands down.

That last one had Hermione in a bit of a twist. She worked hard for her grades and received genuine joy from getting good ones. The feeling of being called on and having the answer brought delight to her soul. The deep sense of satisfaction she received when she got back O's for her work. It spurred her on, driving her to seek that pleasure of perfection.

Luna Lovegood seemed to be at best only loosely related with reality. Hermione had never seen the girl in the library studying, or at all come to think of it. Yet she heard nothing but incredulous praise at how intelligent and gifted the girl was.

She would see the girl dancing in the greens. Sitting on eaves relaxing in the sun or just wandering around.

It frustrated Hermione so much she was beginning to lose sleep over it. She finally broke down and spoke up about it after Professor McGonagall confronted her.

"Ah, I see the problem here. Hermione you have two options I will present you. First I give you the answer right here and now. Secondly I guide you on the path to find the answer yourself. Take you time and think about it."

Hermione wanted nothing more than to just get the answer now. If she had the answer she could research it and find how to close the gap.

Yet she hesitated, Professor McGonagall had hinted just by giving the second option that it was the one she preferred. She battled with her indecision until her desire to please and gain their praise won out.

"The second option please Professor McGonagall."

Minerva could clearly see it pained the girl to take this route but she had.

"Excellent choice. I believe you are having a bit of trouble with the color changing charms correct?"

Hermione nodded, personally ashamed of her perceived failure.

"Perhaps it would behoove you to visit the astronomy tower tomorrow afternoon before dinner?"

Hermione nodded completely unsure of what was going on but trusting her Professor.

Hermione made her way to the top of the tower and say Luna Lovegood there already.

The girl was sitting on a cushion with one beside her on the railing looking out to a sunset.

Hermione walked over and Luna patted the cushion and smiled at her. Once Hermione was seated she started to speak only to be stopped.

"Shhh... you'll scare away the tortoise winged bumbles. Look, watch them dance."

She waved her arm out encompassing the Black Lake and the growing horizon as the sun set.

Hermione looked hard trying to find any such nonsense creature for a few minutes before huffing.

"Look, see, don't use your eyes silly."

Hermione huffed again, how was she supposed to look without using her eyes.

Closing them she started trying to meditate, perhaps that was what she meant.

"You can't see anything if you close your eyelids silly. Look, see, truly open and see. Stop thinking and see."

Hermione was getting frustrated but Professor McGonagall had set this up and she wouldn't fail the Professor.

Trying to keep her eyes unfocused she felt her breathing begin to slow. She watched as the colors of the lake and horizon changed as time passed.

She soon found herself lost to the world as she felt the magic of color and change happen in front of her.

It was dark when she looked away and she pulled out her wand. She felt the color changing spell in ways she had never dreamed of before.

The magic itself was dancing in the way a sunset fell into a rainbow of colors. Looking around she noticed Luna Lovegood was gone but she understood a little bit now.

"How Professor, I understand but don't understand. It's incredible and makes no sense at all! Please help me understand what happened!"

Minerva was sure this was what would happen. She was glad the girl had at least learned some of the lesson.

"Hermione how do you think the first spells were made? What inspired the first spell, what drove witches and wizards to creating spells? How do you think new spells are crafted?"

She gave the girl plenty of time to work through it. She could tell Hermione was almost there.

"Picture what you saw tonight again and think of what it means for wizarding kind."

Minerva could tell it clicked finally.

"That's the heart of magic, the base components of spells! The natural magic of the universe! That's amazing! Why don't we learn this in class?"

"It's not something you can teach. You are exceptionally lucky young miss Lovegood is attending Hogwarts while you are here."

"Not even once a century does a Child of Magic such as her come along in the whole of the world. She sees what little she helped you see last night in full around her all the time. I'm told it's an incredible experience, though Children of Magic are not fully in this realm with us."

"They live in magic itself, a foot in two worlds so to speak. They create wonderous bases for spells that we refine and refine for centuries. They are the layers of our foundation. The rest of us are the builders who create the buildings of magic atop those foundations. We need them, they most assuredly do not need us."

Hermione was stunned. This was an insurmountable gap. She could feel that moment had been unique and she was gifted to have ever felt such a moment. It put her entire life into a new framework of perspective.

"Thank you Professor, I have much to think about now."

Hermione may not be a foundation layer, she did promise to herself she would be the best builder though. Luna would need friends as well. Harry and Ron would soon be joining her in her quest to cherish Luna Lovegood.

Hermione was the best at whatever she did, so she would be the best builder to the best Child of Magic ever. This she swore.

*** This is really different than how I'm responding to my own prompt, and that is a great thing!! I love Hermione realizing that the things that make Luna stick out from the crowd are actually a great thing instead of pitying her from a high horse. Also love her confiding in McGonagall & then Minerva giving her solid advice without criticizing her.

** Alright I'm trying hard to deliver on my promises while still living my best ADHD life, so here's a preview of what I'm working on [[/u/Chess345][u/Chess345]] [[/u/Team-Mako-N7][u/Team-Mako-N7]]

ETA the summary cause of course I forgot it: basically, Hermione encounters ADHD Astoria and is not feelin it but the real WTF moment is when she finds out Astoria's OWL results and totally has a booksmart style freak out

By the end of the first week of term, Hermione had become inexplicably intrigued by Astoria, to Harry's amused satisfaction after she subjected him to a rant that sounded far too similar to one of his own regarding Malfoy. Astoria seemed to be on a different wavelength than everyone else. Not in the way that Luna was, though. Astoria was radiating with energy and overflowing with ideas--but less like a bubbling cauldron of Felix Felicis and more like a Chernobyl nuclear reactor. It was exhausting just listening to her sometimes. Like the time Hermione was forced to hear her talking to a Hufflepuff sixth-year in the corridor, because Astoria could be both a fast talker and a /loud/ talker.

“I had a very productive summer,” she said. “I agitated Slytherin House into a state of youthful rebellion, facilitated a takeover of Malfoy Manor, and learned how to do liquid eyeliner. Oh, and I decided to take up the guitar, because I thought it would make me look cool...But anyway, was there anything interesting in the Transfiguration reading? I didn't have time to do it because I was up until three a.m. reading about Lethifolds and now I'm fucking obsessed. Did you hear about the bloke who staged an attack in an attempt to leave his wife? If it were me, I would never have been caught. What a fucking amateur! But let me tell you, If Draco tried that shit, he would wish the Lethifold had got him. Because I would slowly and painfully murder him myself. And you can take that to Gringotts!”

This one-sided conversation was just one of hundreds of items on Hermione's list of why she was grateful not to be in the same House as Astoria. There's no way she would have been able to tolerate the overdue library books and mugs missing from the Great Hall that apparently cluttered not only Astoria's bedroom, but numerous nooks and crannies of the Slytherin common room. In fact, so many mugs went unaccounted for that one of the house-elves threatened suicide and Astoria solved that problem by personally purchasing a large order of mugs with the Slytherin crest and proceeding to leave /those/ all over the castle. As for the library situation--Astoria apparently thought it was a better use of her time to create various disguises to elude Madam Pince instead of simply making the effort to meet a /very reasonable/ expectation. It was not a laughing matter for a student to so /obstinately/ refuse to return the books in the /respectful/ and /orderly/ manner that befitted a sanctuary of knowledge. It /really/ bothered Hermione, alright?
