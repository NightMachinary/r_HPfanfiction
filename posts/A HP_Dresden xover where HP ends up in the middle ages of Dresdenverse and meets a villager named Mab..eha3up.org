I think it then jumped to present times, I can't really remember anything except he was Winter Knight.


** This is Ice Age by ryuugi. It's on ff.net but only with a few chapters. On [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-potter-the-dresden-files-ice-age.280474/][spacebattles]], there are more chapters, but still unfinished.

Btw, if you enjoy this, you might like the reverse set up. In [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/don-dresden-founder-of-hogwarts-dresden-files-harry-potter.790927/][Don Dresden]], Harry Dresden goes back to England just after the Norman conquest. It's sort of a fusion between Dresden Files and Harry Potter. It's also still updating regularly.

*** That last fic you recommended doesn't make a lick of sense. Harry Potter magic doesn't exist anymore. It just replaced. This isn't a crossover, just a cheap knockoff.

**** It's as much a crossover as any crossover that just puts a single character into a different setting. Characters and elements of it are clearly taken from Harry Potter, and that's enough for me.
