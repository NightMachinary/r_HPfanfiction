*Snape*: Tut, tut. Fame clearly isn't everything.

*Harry*: Thank you, Professor. I'm glad to finally see someone in this school who realises that.


** Then Harry would get detention for backtalk.

Snape was determined to hate Harry and nothing he says or does can change that.

** In the fic The Fires of Magic by Raolin Harry raised in a monastery that thrives on pranks, jokes, and random attacks reacts to his first potions lesson.

Snape - ah Mr. Potter our newest celebrity.

Harry - Thanks it's always nice to meet a fan.

It goes downhill from there for Snape

**** Well there's still hope. He also goes under the same name on ffn and the last update on one of his other stories is April 2020 so he is still writing. Hopefully he will pick this story back up.

  The curse Voldemort cast on baby Harry had far-reaching effects on Harry's magic. Harry must now explore those effects, and magic itself, all while battling killer teachers, giant beasts, and more in a school that really needs a safety board. Luckily for Harry, he doesn't have to do this all alone. Harry/multi. Contains AU, OC characters, and more. Book One will cover first year and the events of the Philosopher's Stone.

*** I doubt anyone would really care, I very much doubt it was actually a secret, but it's muggleborns that they really hate, that's why they get a special slur and why when Voldemort takes over you only need to a single magical parent to not get rounded up.

** No matter your feelings on how Snape is as a person, while I think the whole "he has to be cruel because he is a spy" argument is utter bs, there's something in that when it comes to Harry. It is strategically unwise of Snape to /not/ dislike Harry, because if he has a relationship not built upon mutual dislike -- even if it's merely just respect -- Voldemort is going to demand that he abduct Harry, abusing Harry's trust in him. Thus, Snape has to engineer a dislike for him, the easiest way probably being to deliberately project James Potter upon him, even if Snape might objectively know that it might be a gross misjudgement (after all, Harry hasn't known James since he was a toddler).

Thus, he'd probably just give Harry a detention for backtalking as a result of that reply.

Note that I /only/ give him a pass for the treatment of Harry specifically. It does not justify how he treats others -- such as how he bullies Longbottom, the infamous "I see no difference", etc.
