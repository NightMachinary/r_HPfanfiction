Hey guys, quick question. How much would a reasonable bounty be for defeating Voldemort, so as to avoid inheriting money. I don't want it to be too much, seeing as a wand is only 7 galleons.


** JKR once said 1 Galleon equaled 5 Pounds.

By that exchange rate:

50000 Pounds for a most-wanted criminal was remarkably small.

The twins started their business with 1000 Galleons or 5000 Pounds. I mean, what can you do these days with 5000 Pounds in London, 1-2 months rent of a flat?

The latest average home price in London is now 556350 Pounds, more than 100000 Galleons.

**** Agreed on that, twins' store was HUGE and it was in Diagon Alley. They had to decorate it, buy necessary tools, advertise, create the very first batch to start the business up, register with ministry, pay the bills, buy ingredients for their jokes, and since they left their home, pay for their lives. I know even though Mrs Weasley disagrees with their choice of work she would help them, but their base line was merely 1000 galleons.

***** If inflation didn't affect Wizarding Britain, then a lot of muggleborns would be filthy rich compared to the purebloods. And that would mean that Malfoy's bribes could be easily topped by someone like Justin.

Which would be a really interesting, but a bit hard to explain story.

******* It would certainly wreck canon. But it would also mean that the numerous ways to make muggle money as a wizard - reparo spells come to mind, as does stealing with magical help - would have to be considered carefully. Limiting the money you can exchange would help some, but even so goods could be purchased from muggles, and sold in Wizarding Britain to turn muggle wealth into wizarding wealth. I'm certain how the economics of such a setting would work out.

Edited to add: The HP Lexicon page on money contains a list of items and their costs. I'm not certain if it is comprehensive, but it is probably a good place to start.

**** Well, think like that: 1000 Galleons could buy you a two-story property on /the/ most frequented Alley in Britain, plus the means to start your business.

I'd think that you'd want to have people really go for it, so make the deal something that would set you up for life. I'm reasonably sure that with 10.000 Galleons you'd never have to work again, given that you don't spend it on Veela hookers and firewhiskey.

But then again, Rowling didn't really go into the currency system of the wizarding world. You should just make sure that whatever you set up, Voldemorts bounty should let the average man live in reasonable luxury for the rest of his life.

****** True, no I'm not sure, but I assumed.

This assumption comes from the fact that, as OP stated, a wand costs only 7 Galleons. Granted, wands /could/ be cheap, but I honestly doubt that. Since Ollivander needs to make his big cash in August when the students come for their first wand, I assume that 7 galleons is a shitton of money.

With a thousand, I just assume that its enough to buy a store plus apartment.

But again, I only assumed.

I also refuse to believe that ollivander would live middle-classy. He is one of two wandmakers we know of (plus the third somewhere in France that is hinted). Services by a craftsman that special have to cost a small fortune.

******* Wands are expensive enough that getting Ron a new one was a genuine financial burden in CoS, and the Weasleys ended up using some of their prize money at the start of PoA for it. Then again, I think a good analogy would be a mobile phone - versatile, personal, and while they're generally not cheap (especially smartphones), they're also cheap enough that most people in Britain can afford one.

******* It might be a little weird, but I was toying with the "power he knows not bit" and was thinking that Harry would be immune to the unforgivable curses (Killing curse be reflected, imperius curse be unnoticed, and the cruciatus curse doing nothing), but to contrast that, regular spells would be doubly effective on him (Stupefy knocking him out for a week, Rictusempra being almost like a low powered crucio)

Second part would be with magical bounties, say killing someone that has a bounty on their head be registered by their magic

********* I was thinking that instead of the horcrux being dormant inside of him, it was instead fighting for control of Harry against his own soul. Since the killing curse tears away the soul from the body, that wouldn't work on someone with 2 souls so the magic is rebounded. For the Cruciatus curse, which I interpret as powerful magic that attacks all the nerves in the body. I was thinking that magic resided in the soul, so Harry has lots of uncontrollable magic which would protect against nerve damage from pure magic (say like diamond-like skin would deflect blades.). And for the imperius curse, because of the fight for control of the souls, Harry naturally became a natural occlumens to protect his mind from insanity, and that would mean the imperius would do nothing. As for other magic being double effective, I was thinking that the volatile magic that Harry had would amplify the spells effect, and over the course of the story he would try to control it. Along with the volatile magic he would have lots of accidental bursts of magic (shaking someones had would accidentally zap them occasionally, frustration would cause him to throw everything away from him)

************ I'm assuming red because that's Voldemort's eye color? Eh, maybe. If you make it too blatant to observers (in-story) it could provide a /massive/ clue about the horcrux, which may or may not be what you want. Subtle tinting (or making them a brighter green than usual, you could fluff it as being the color of avada kedavra or something) might be a better idea if you're trying to keep the horcruxes as a mystery and source of conflict.

************ Imo yes,flashing red is such an overused trope and there are so many good ways of showing latent power. Smell of ozone, random things moving slightly. You can use things less clear, sounds are muted, Harry's hair waving slightly, eyes twinkling like dumbledore, maybe dumbledore has a lot of magic in him so his eyes twinkle but he is old and learned enough to control it.

IMO big winds from nowhere and red eyes are like big obnoxious flashing neon signs say, Yo Ho, magic over here, hey everyone this guy is powerful.

But that's just my opinion if you can make it work, more power to you

** Well, let's take a real life counterpart to the Dark Lord--Osama Bin Laden. His bounty was $25 million. Converting that to 1996 Pounds, that's £25,660,000.00 to £37,070,000.00. Since 1 Galleon = 5 Pounds, that would be 5,132,000 Galleons to 7,414,000 Galleons. I think the lower range would be reasonable.
