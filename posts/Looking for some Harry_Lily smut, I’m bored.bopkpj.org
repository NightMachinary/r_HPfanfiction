****** Internalized misandry! Same reason people get up in arms over male on female sexual assault, but have much less severe reactions when it's reversed and it's female on male.

Ok, so I'm not entirely serious, but this kind of thing absolutely /is/ a prevalent double-standard. I don't know how many times I've heard it said that women can't sexually assault or abuse men.
