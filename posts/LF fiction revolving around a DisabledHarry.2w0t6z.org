**** D:

WHAT! THE! FUCK!

Does anybody recall the romanian slave-children from the anime "Black Lagoon"? Yea...

edit: I'm done reading it. This shit is fucked up. Well written, heartbreaking and oh so fucked up. This turned parts of my soul darker.

*** Holly shit. Catechism , just into half of the first chapter and i have the irresistible urge to crucio them into insanity at least a couple hundred times. And then that unforgivables are immoral , fuck this shit.

Anyway on a serious note , whatever they do to him it's nothing that leggimency and a good memory charm cannot solve. Still it's fucked up.

** I have a few that revolves around disabled characters, but not so much Harry specifically (blindness seems to be the most common disability). So if OCs/next-gen are interesting as well(?), I have some recs.

**** I may have spoken a bit to soon, realized I only really have one rec, [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=308582][Blind]]. It's one of my favorite fics though. Also there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11051880/1/Overcome][Overcome]] which is brand spanking new but looks promising.

** Here's [[http://painless-j.net/2007/08/30/themed-list-disability/][painless_j's themed list: disability]]. It has lots of good fics, but it hasn't been updated since 2007. Many of them feature pairings, but all are well marked.

** For the Love of Family. Involves Harry recovering from a disabling injury. Mostly canon and very sweet. Also super long!
