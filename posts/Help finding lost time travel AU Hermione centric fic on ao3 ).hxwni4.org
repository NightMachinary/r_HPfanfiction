:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hello!

I've tried all the filtering combinations I could think of and couldn't find a really excellent fic I want to read again, so I was wondering if any of you lovely people could help :)

This is what I remember:

It was a relatively long time travel AU where Hermione ends up going back to founders era and enters into a poly relationship with S Slytherin and R Ravenclaw; Ravenclaw is pregnant when Hermione leaves for modern time but Hermione doesn't know, and their child ends up being Helena, who Hermione gets to meet in ghost form. Honestly this is a complete deviation from what I usually read, but it was so well-written it was worth it.


** Color me interested.. A quick search yielded nothing here though..
