For the purposes of this thread: Shipping doesn't count!

Only Gen fics, please. (One exception: The vast majority, aka 95%+, of the fic is about the friendship and the romantic relationship is only an afterthought, like the epilogue of DH)

The presence of Hermione is optional, as long as she isn't bashed. I'm fundamentally incompatible with authors (and people) who dislike Hermione.

[to clarify what 'not a Death Eater' means: I will accept AU fics in which Harry is friends with Draco as long as Draco isn't a Death Eater under the *loosest* definitions of Death Eaters... no "he's not /technically/ a Death Eater" weaseling and no ambiguities please]


** I'd throw in my own "No longer alone". Basically, during his third year, Harry gets fed up with Ron and Hermione fighting with each other so he hangs out with Katie Bell and her friend Leanne (Rivers) instead. While both of his old friends come around after the summer break, well, let's just say that Ron canonically fucks up in GoF. There's a romantic side plot in the most recent chapters, but it is nowhere central to the story. Hermione is in no shape or form bashed, even if the first few chapters have Harry a little hurt due to her overworking herself.

Probably people thinking that I either bashed Hermione too much (or at all), or too little. You'd be surprised how hostile some reviewers can be towards fictional characters.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  As Voldemort dies, he hits Harry with a spell that blasts him to an alternate universe where Voldemort never existed. Everything seems good until he learns two things: 1. He's in love with Hermione Granger, and 2. She's a muggle who has never met him.

  By definition, Death Eaters are only the inner circle of Voldy. Like the elite of the elite. The only student out of Hogwarts being a real Death Eater was Draco Malfoy. The rest was as far as we know only sympathizers or unconfirmed :P
#+end_quote

Yes, I understand, which is exactly why I clarified it as "loosest possible definition". But I assume you got my intent and are just kidding around. "no Death Eaters, people who sympathize with Voldemort or those who like to hunt Muggles for sports" would have been a tad too long for a title.

Thanks for the rec. ;)
