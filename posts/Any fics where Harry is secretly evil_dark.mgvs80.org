Plenty of fics where Harry is super duper edgy, dark, or evil but it's apparent to the crowd/everyone else in the story.

I want to read a fic where Harry maintains a facade, like he pretends to still be the nice swell dude that canon Harry is, but underneath that hes crazy/evil/manipulative.

Something like Light from Death Note or a bit like Lelouch from Code Geass. (Sorry for just name dropping for those who don't know these characters.)

Preferably no slash, but it isn't a strict requirement!


** linkao3(7322935) is somewhat like that, particularly with the scarring scene.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation at this point.Skylar is the boy who lived, that's why he's important.

I'm going to make you listen, because I want you to understand how you made me a monster. I'll call this story antithesis, and you're going to learn every single moment where things went wrong. I want you to cry, and beg for me to kill you, and when I'm done with this, you're going to want to do that to yourself. You're going to listen, because in the end, you owe me that much. You owe me so much more, but here we are, and this is how it's going to end. Who knows, maybe this useless battle between you and me and this bloody world, well, maybe we always were fated to kill each other. Do you know what it is like to be unmade?

** There's one where he's not evil, just selfish with a “no one is gonna look out for you, so they can all fuck off” sort of mentality that he hides behind a canon-ish facade:

  The most brilliant things can happen by complete chance. Yosuke discovers this when he texts a wrong number and winds up with a best friend. Or: AU where Yosuke accidentally texts Souji six months before he arrives in Inaba.
