** FemVoldemort x Harry is difficult to write, since she killed his parents and is pretty much the magical equivalent of hitler, even when she is sane.

Harry x Delphini isn't written because she's born in 1998 when Harry is 18, and even if they aged her up a few years, it really doesn't work.

Well written Harry x Fleur fics don't happen often because most times when Fleur is written with Harry, she isn't written as an actual character, but a french prize for Harry to win.

Even if there is a chance to build more of the world by pairing Harry with these characters, it's not worth it if the end result is a bad romance.

**** Well, Delphini isn't a blank slate, because however much I refuse to believe it, JKR says that CC is canon. So Delphini's personality is canon, and so are her motives. And de-aging her to Harry's age remove's both her motivation for living, and changes her personality irreparably, making her the equivalent of an OC.

******** An OC is a fan made character created for a purpose, a blank slate is like Daphne Greengrass. Plus everyone has their own OC bias, so some just choose to change the blank slate, like you're saying. To me at least, it's known unknowns (blank slate) versus unknown unknowns (OCs), something like a Johari window. Sometimes having that familiar name helps, sometimes it's detrimental, and while they're very similar, humans love to nitpick differences.

** Two ideas:

1) A parody based on Emma Watson's "Panama Paper":

#+begin_quote
  The memory grew brighter. “Professor Slughorn,” Hermione asked brightly, “What if someone wanted to split his wealth into multiple offshore accounts? Say...seven?

  “Good heavens, seven?”

  “Well, isn't seven considered a magically significant number?”

  “Merlin's beard, girl! Isn't it bad enough to consider doing it once? To dodge their tax bill seven times...This is all hypothetical, isn't it, Hermione? All academic?”

  “Of course, sir,” Hermione said, smiling. “It'll be our little secret.”
#+end_quote

--------------

2) Someone at Space Battles wrote a snippet about an idea where Lily lived, but Harry still ended up with Petunia. I couldn't find the original page since I copy and pasted to my Google Docs a few years back. But I really like this concept and I'm certain nobody has written a full story about it:

#+begin_quote
  Claymore mines. The best protection a mother can offer to her child. Shame James was hit as well, but it's not like she didn't warn him about the concussive force.

  Lily: I am leaving tomorrow.

  Petunia: Another one of your "errands"?

  Lily: Yes. A new menace is rising in Australia.

  Petunia: Is it that important that you can't stay another week?

  Lily: Is it one of those discussions?

  Petunia: Just tell me why you think you have to do it.

  Lily: Because somebody has to. And it may as well be me. I have the means and inclination.

  Petunia: At a cost of your son?

  Lily: I left him in good hands, didn't I?

  Petunia: But you left him.

  Lily: ...

  Lily: It will be easier when he starts Hogwarts. For you and for him. He'll be away for the most part of the year, among children of his age. He'll make friends. And I'll make sure to visit him on summer.

  Petunia: I am still against sending him there. Didn't you tell me that the last war ended too abruptly? Tensions not resolved, merely put on hold? Do you really want to send him into that world?

  Lily: I have no choice. He is too famous now. I can't hide him.

  Petunia: He is famous because of you, you know? If you didn't disappear, if you didn't let the fools draw their conclusions...

  Lily: You know how that happened. I was in a bad place back then. With James' death and everything else I... just... couldn't... The deed is done now.

  Petunia: You can rectify it. You can reveal yourself to them, lift the burden from him.

  Lily: My death is too important. It allows me to move more freely.

  Petunia: You mean it makes life easier for you. What about him?

  Lily: ...

  Petunia: Just... When will you stop? The boy needs his mother.

  Lily: When I find salvation. The end to all conflicts.

  Petunia: There isn't one.

  Lily: I know.

*** I'd love to read more of that idea. The only fic I've seen where Lily lives but Harry still goes to live with Petunia is Deathly Hallowed by Shujin1. The story is a little obscure and hard to follow sometimes, but I really enjoyed reading it until I got to the end and realized it wasn't complete. I think it's abandoned.

** Personally I wish we'd get to see more stories featuring OCs. I feel that the Harry Potter universe is so expansive it should be possible for authors to write whatever they want within the world. I really wish authors would just write stories within the world that aren't constrained by the canon characters. I just feel like there's so much room for creativity in fanfiction but people rarely stray from the existing characters within the books.

*** Are you interested in OC only stories or are ones with two or three canon characters in between a lot of OCs fine as well? Because if that's the case, my "Dawn of Darkness" could be something that you. It's a Harry/Tonks story which leaves the canon plot behind by chapter 2 and from chapter 9 onwards (which I'm currently working on), other canon characters will rarely make an appearance. A lot of World building is centered around the magical nations of Europe and their interactions while Harry is stuck in the middle with Tonks.

***** Well, my story is not about the life of Friedrich Zimmer, clerk in the Ministry of Magic in Berlin, but about various magical countries and groups (one of which is Voldemort and his followers) pursuing their goals and clashing as a result. Harry, Tonks and, due to something barely related, Penelope Clearwater get stuck in the middle of it, trying to figure out what's going on. Quite a bit of worldbuilding for magical Europe, magical archaeology, magical landscapes, influential groups besides the Order and the Death Eaters, that kind of stuff.

- A story featuring a natural Legilimens like Queenie in /Fantastic Beasts/ who isn't an OP Harry.

- Harry and Ginny switch bodies Freaky Friday-style due to soul shenanigans in the Chamber of Secrets, but no Soul Bond.

Better development of Harry and Ginny's relationship

Ron maturing

Lupin/Tonks just because I want the existence of Teddy, but they can split after that or Lupin grows a pair... Maybe Lupin dies in the battle but Tonks survives and gets with Charlie

Basically a better re-write of HBP and DH. The last two always seemed disconnected to me, like JKR started to base her characters on the movie version of them.

** - Stories which have teenagers act like teenagers (sex, drinking, cursing)

- Harry traveling to the Marauder era with an established partner (The closest thing here is "What's a little death between friends")

- Realistic triad relationships with Harry and two girls where said girls are actually characters and not trophies

- Humorous takes on OP Harry similar to "The Bloody wolf of the North"

- Harry/Slytherin girls without all the usual clichés (like your average Daphne Greengrass fic). Give me some decent Pansy stories where she is more than a girl who gets redeemed by Harry's cock of the Greater Good.

- Stories where the Death Eaters are shown as the scum they are.

- Realistic Harry/Hermione stories where they actually get into a relationship before confessing their undying love

- Hermione being her canon self of a slightly ruthless bitch who might not be the most pleasant person to be around but would do anything for Harry. In fanfiction she's either a 11/10 sex goddess with an IQ above 167 or a moronic lapdog of Dumbledore.

- Harry/Ginny/Hermione stories that are not just smut

- Decent Harry/Ginny stories where Hermione is neither bashed nor paired with Ron, Draco or Snape

- Harry being raised by his Evans grandparents

- Harry getting a de facto bigger sister (Tonks, one of the Gryffindor Chasers, Penelope Clearwater)

- Harry bonding with one of the background professors (like Babbling in Rune Stone Path)

- Harry and Andromeda bonding over Teddy

- Tonks ditching Lupin in DH

- Lily/Sirius fics which are not about getting back at James or Snape for something. The only decent one I know has Sirius getting pegged by Lily.

- Free love Hogwarts with Orgies. The only decent one I know there is "The free use experience" which is admittedly the best smut I know but the plot is problematic since girls have to agree to sex or they won't get anywhere in life.

- Genderswap stories where a recently changed female Harry is into girls and experiences all the firsts from a female PoV.

- Slice of Life Harry&Hermione friendship fics without canon pairings.

**** For three reasons.

1. It offers both male and female PoV, and in Harry's case both. Metamorphic gender swaps for purely sexual purposes are definitely my thing.

2. The smut is somewhat believable. There's proper foreplay and a good mixture between hornyness, awkwardness and spontaneity. It reads like amateur porn, not the scripted professional productions. Yes, their sex drives are probably slightly exaggerated, but I know people who have that issue. It brings "horny teenagers" across quite well.

3. Body proportions are not grossly exaggerated. No one has F cups or a cock bigger than the calibre of battleships guns. Word choices are alright, nothing too cringeworthy or obscure. Not too technical either. A good mixture between describing the act and the emotions. It's not Happy Weasley family level of ridiculous.

The plot of the story is questionable, much like the plot of any porn movie. The world is pretty distopian, but it is marginally better than a marriage law. The author is kind enough to put content warnings on every chapter and you can find the smutty parts quite easily. I have no siblings, so the idea of a protagonist shagging his doesn't bother me. And so far, there haven't been any noncon situations (and there are plenty more non forced ones queued, which means they won't come up in the foreseeable future).

I've read plenty other stories, but the only decent smut scenes I can name out of my memory are "Dignity in fear" which is heavily focused on emotions, "A boy and his cloak", which doesn't go all the way and "Time to rest", which is a free for all orgy between The four Triwizard champions and Hermione. There are plenty more which are either far too flowery, or have too much built up for too little smut. "Parkinson's knickers" falls into that category, as do a couple of the rare pairing femslash ones on AO3.

Harry has even formed a task force named Muggle Interface Team (MIT), consisting of Susan Bones, Lavender Brown, and a Muggle OC named Roberta Beadle. All his fics are strictly Epilogue compliant.

Harry and Ron time travel without Hermione: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6452481/1/][Gryffindors Never Die]], linkffn(6452481). In their future timeline, Hermione and Ginny divorced both their husbands because of political disagreements. Harry and Ron led very successful careers, but deeply unhappy lives, until higher powers decided to offer them a second chance. Once back, they started acting out and antagonizing everyone around them, especially their future spouses.

**** Voyage of Starship Hedwig is really a good one, if one does not mind its ending, They have to build an actual crude magical space ship battling against time, suffering heavy losses, an actual exploration, all the dangers it involved. There are no shortcuts in that. They have to work hard for everything. most importantly no one man show, everyone has a role to play, make sacrifices.

  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Canon to Epilogue, then not so much... (Reworked)
