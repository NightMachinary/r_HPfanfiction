** The Changeling by Annerb. Ginny is sorted into Slytherin, told from her perspective with a chapter a year, length increasing each time.

A truly stunning character piece.

Edit: Didn't notice ThatGree(k/n)Lady's post. Still, count this as a seconding, with reasons!

  Harry Potter was sent away to the Dursleys by his parents who were raising Jim Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Think you know this story? You have no idea. AU, Slytherin!Harry, WBWL. Currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Hopefully no bashing.

  A collection of shorts covering the school years of a group of Slytherin students at Hogwarts. Voldemort might not be their primary concern, but that doesn't guarantee carefree times in the powerplays of the House of the ambitious and cunning.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

**** I will say that it's better-written fic than most out there, and it's an underexplored niche that I am very fond of, myself, but that makes the implementation even more disappointing. In other words, it /tries/ to do the things you list, but it does them in such an inept and pathetic way, that I'd almost rather it'd not try in the first place.

In particular, the Slytherins in a more political light? What do they actually /do/ that involves any amount of political sophistication? I recall a lot of complaining about how nobody likes them, but little actual politicking, whatever that means, and none that Hermione has to do, anyway: she pretty much behaves like canon!Draco, but with a bigger persecution complex and more ruthlessly --- which she gets away with, because she's a special snowflake. Similarly, Muggleborn accepted at one of their own? I can see that happening, by hook or by crook, but what we saw was pretty much everyone (who has a name) instantly liking her for no clear reason, again, because she's a special snowflake. As for Voldemort's demise? Voldemort acts like a kindly uncle or grandpa toward her: he just likes her, trusts her, spoils her, again, because she's a special snowflake. The cunning plan they had to get rid of Voldemort only worked because Voldemort as affected by Hermione's special snowflakeness as everyone else, and never bothered to investigate trivial things like Bellatrix's and Fenrir's suspicious deaths or check if anyone was plotting against him.

A while after I wrote my rant, someone pointed out that it's really a thinly-veiled Mary Sue fic, and that actually does make everything fall into place.

****** Thank you for the thoughtful reply. Again, I won't deny that the fic had some interesting ideas that, written by a more thoughtful writer, would have made for a fascinating story. I cannot address your specific points, because it's been months since I read that fic and I have neither the time nor the interest in rereading it, but those serve mainly to illustrate the general trend: this is the Slytherin!Hermione equivalent of Robst's /Harry Crow/, in which the protagonist does not have to face any meaningful challenges and adversity --- even though she constantly acts like she does and complains about it ceaselessly --- and there's constant bashing and degradation of characters not in the protagonist's clique. The details themselves might be interesting and even justifiable (especially if you take the Bizarro Potterverse the fic takes place in as a given), but its core, its big picture, its grand scheme of things, is rotten.

Anyway, perhaps I've gotten too picky in my old age, and I shouldn't be telling people to [[https://xkcd.com/359/][Stop Having Fun]], but /The Green Girl/ is a popular and influential fic, and I hope that in at least pointing out its mistakes I could contribute to authors writing similar fics in the future not making the same mistakes.
