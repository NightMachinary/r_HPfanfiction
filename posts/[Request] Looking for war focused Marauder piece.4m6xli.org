As the titles states, I am looking for a marauders era fic based around the first war. I would prefer canon, but can be tempted other wise.

Also, I do not mind if it is J/L or anything, but if it is a romance fic, I want the war to play a central part.

Thanks, and I hope you guys can help me!

** Not first war but linkffn(Return of the Marauders) was fairly Marauder heavy. It was recently rec'd here as some guys favourite and while I wouldn't go that far it is ok.

  James sacrificed himself to save his wife and son. Sirius took them into hiding and trained Harry the Marauders way. Neville became the BWL. That doesn't mean that he's the Chosen One. This is a AU story. Harry/Ginny MA Rating
