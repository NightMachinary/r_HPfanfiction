** Despite what you may think, most 14 - 16 year old girls aren't clambering for sex. Ron, not having genuine feelings for Lavender, would have turned her down, even had she asked. Hermione wouldn't have with Krum since she wasn't particularly attracted to him. Ginny, at Hermione's behest, was only putting herself out there to get over Harry and wasn't really interested in Dean or Michael, which is why she was able to get over them so easily.

Furthest any of them got was probably Ron, since groping was heavily implied.

Him being a hormonal teenage boy, that seems unlikely to say the least.

**** He tried to get out of making out with her at every turn. Insensitive as he may be at times, he's not so horrible as to hit it and quit it. He was raised better than that. The only girl he's ever seemed interested in was Hermione, and Fleur doesn't count because she was using her Veela devil vagina magic.

** Probably had something to do with it being a kids story when written.

I also felt that Harry is pretty awkward socially, so that wouldn't have helped.

** What on earth are you talking about? Canon never even suggests any of them actually had sex. You can read into it what you will, but don't claim it's canon. Posts like this make you look like some weird sexually frustrated troll.

Oh . . .

** Romilda wanted to rape him by dosing him with love potion, if that counts?

** Uh...does he have to?

And second, he has no one to give him a "talk."

Lastly, this isn't set on United States.
