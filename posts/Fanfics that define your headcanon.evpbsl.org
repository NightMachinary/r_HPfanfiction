What are some fics out there that define your headcanon? Something like izzythehutt's Black Sheep Dog series is basically how I view the Black family dynamic now. I never gave a lot of thought to Sirius' family before, but now that's all I picture.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1036611]]

What are some of yours? Preferably something that explores things the books or movies never got to.


** Six Pomegranate Seeds is my go to for the magic of Hogwarts. The idea of the gestalt of all who have been there, it's protections and so forth. I also like it's rationale for why Hermione was given a time turner.

#+begin_quote
  The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.

** Dumbledore having dementia

He makes a lot of highly questionable decisions in canon and if he's not manipulative then he must have mental illness. He's quite old so it's not impossible.

The first fic I saw this in was linkffn(The benefits of old laws) but I've seen it a few more times since

#+begin_quote
  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

****** Imagine you're doing a math problem that takes a lot of time to calculate, but once you have the solution it's easy to check that it's right.

If you could send a message to your past self, you could basically send him a solution, and it'd be easy to see if it's right.

But what if your future self sends you a wrong solution? Then you send your past self something else.

This would again cause past self to get a (probably wrong) solution, and another different solution gets sent back in time and checked.

By using the time travel cleverly, all solutions are basically tried simultaneously, and since only the right solution ends up with itself always getting sent back, that's the result.

But because of the way Harry thinks, "Don't mess with time" is also a correct solution, because while it doesn't solve the math problem it als results in getting sent back.
