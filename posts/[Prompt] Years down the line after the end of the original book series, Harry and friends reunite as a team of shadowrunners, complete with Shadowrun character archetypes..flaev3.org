*Harry:* The Rockerboy. He uses his fame to get himself to places people normally wouldn't be able to get to, and his social skills and reputation to get people to do what he wants them to. He's not living the high life, he's just getting by, but when he talks to people, he makes them feel important, like somebody famous and important is taking time out to pay attention to them.

*Hermione:* The Burned Company Woman. She used to believe in the Ministry. After all, they provided for her schooling with Hogwarts through maintaining the Ministry of Education, and she worked for them for years, with absolute loyalty. Then, one day, she was blacklisted, and all she had time to do was grab a few things and go. Her Gringotts vault was put into lockdown, her reputation besmirched, but she'll be all right; she might be on the run, but she's not running away. She can fight, even if that's not her specialty, which is more planning, working the angles and analyzing the big picture.

*Ron:* The Street Samurai. He doesn't have a lot of money or the qualifications to get more through your typical means of employment, so he'll make every knut stretch as he works the underground, and then, piece by piece, he'll upgrade his life. He's got a code of honor though, and he's going to follow it, come Hell or high water. Having a big family does come in handy, of course, particularly as contacts.

*Luna:* The Occult Investigator. She's got her conventional sources--a barkeep, an auror, that kind of thing--but, oh, if you thought she was making up all those creatures, the joke's on you; they're all different kinds of spirits that she's got ongoing deals with, and they're happy to come to her help, for a favor in return, of course.

*Neville:* The Bounty Hunter: He'll hunt man or beast, as long as the price is right; it was a skill he developed during the Second War, and now he's putting them to work for himself. It's not so much the money, though; it's the thrill of the chase, the challenge of pitting himself up against the deadliest the world as to offer. Dead, alive or as a trophy, if you want something, he'll bring it back for you.

Obviously, this would be AU, but thought it'd be a fun little exercise in dungeonpunk.


** Honestly, this sounds kind of like Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis, but with a more Film Noir spin on things. The trio there are Curse Breakers - Harry (sorta) plays the Face, Hermione the Brains, and Ron the Womanizing Brawn. I can't remember anything about Luna or Neville in that fic, but it's post-Hogwarts, post-Voldie (dealt with in the first 'Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider' prequel) and has a similar vibe.

Other than that, I don't know anything that's done it that way, so I'd second that prompt and hope you get a response. :)

** I had a similar idea. I thought about what if when the Awakening from Shadowrun happens in the HPverse but with the first metababies born during their last year. So around that timeline

** Oh I would kill to read something like this if it was done well. I'd love to see the Ministry Six as a Runner of sorts crew in London, Seattle, or Hong Kong doing mercenary work for powerful people just to get by. I love Shadowrun and I think this would be perfect.

*** It's almost like you didn't read the prompt. The stories you've linked are during the years at Hogwarts, while the prompt is asking for something post-Hogwarts.

Plus, the characterizations are completely different.

  The direct continuation of Harry Potter and the Hermetic Arts, in which cyberpunk-influenced, tabletop RPG-loving Harry Potter continues his life in and out of Hogwarts. Dark!Indie!Sarcastic!Paranoid!Pragmatic!Violent!Harry. Book 2 in Harry Potter and the RPG Influence. Rated M for language and graphic violence.
