Harry was standing before not only full cohort of Hogwarts students, but also before an audience of two more schools. It was Yule ball during a Triwizard tournament after all. So here he was after a dance with Parvati standing before them with a guitar in his hand, song on his lips and suitably nervous.

It was their debut, not as nerve-wracking as flying against a Horntail, or as exiting as trying to kill a Basilisk with a sword, but still unerving. He turns his head looks at Hermiony with Harmoniser and Ron with his Drums. They nod to each other.

Rons hands in the air and he starts beating his drumstics together. Harry smiles, he feels himself getting into grove as Hermione starts playing her notes. After all it's time for Golden Trio to rock wizarding world.

P.S. I imagine that they would become an overnight world starts with Harry's name recognition.
