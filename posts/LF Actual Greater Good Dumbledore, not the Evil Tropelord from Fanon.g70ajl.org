I've never seen Dumbledore written as "Oh Voldemort is back? Better burn down Azkaban with all of his most dangerous followers inside before he decides to free them. I don't like to kill, but it's for the Greater Good, it's always "Let's rob, torment and manipulate a child, defend Death Eaters and not care who dies on the side of the "Light" whilst saying the Words ITS FOR THE GREATER GOOD" like some kind of evil card carrying meme.

I want to see Dumbledore at some point either during the first war, or something triggering him to get real during the second where he gets the Kiritsugu Emiya mentality of "Kill one to save ten" and takes out the Death Eaters whilst they're defenseless.

I've seen Harry go full Kiritsugu in fics, even resulting in cases where Harry actually held the Death Eater children Hostage to bait their parents out. I can't remember the fic for that, but I've never seen Dumbledore just end things in a way that is ACTUALLY For the Greater Good.


** Random thought, suppose Harry happens across Dumbledore's secret plans; he finds the instructions for the modified Obliviate spell, the love potions bubbling and brewing, the balance sheets for his Gringotts account.\\
But when confronted, Dumbledore's defense is; 'I haven't done anything to you; Azkaban is insecure with Voldemort back so I'm planning to brainwash the Death Eaters so they won't flock to his side. It's not something I'm proud of, but I'm sad to say I have few other options. I do have a copy of your Gringotts balance sheet, when I placed you with the Dursleys I was concerned they would take financial advantage of you so I've been keeping an eye on things.'

** I think the reason we don't see a lot of the kind of Dumbledore you are asking for is that, for some reason, "Good is not soft" is an unbelievably underappreciated and poorly-understood trope in this fandom. I honestly don't get why, because canonically, there are a /lot/ of examples of this trope.

So, in my explorations of the fandom, I have found that primarily one of three things tend to happen.

The first case; the author is a bash happy moron who completely eschews any form of narrative subtlety in favour of memefying the phrase "Greater Good" and beating the reader over the head with it to show that DuMbLeDoRe Is EvIl. As a bonus, this can often come with a side of some other super powerful character in the story putting Dumbledork in his place.

The second case; the author is capable, but actually wants to write an Evil!Dumbledore, or at the very least, a Selfish!Manipulative!Dumbledore. So they go ahead and do that, but of course, it breaks away entirely from the canon characterization of Dumbledore, and it's really jarring for me, and I suspect, for quite a few other people. Of course, this type of story can be really well done, but I feel the big problem here is most authors start with a canon depiction of Dumbledore and /then/ try to break away, instead of breaking away at the very beginning. As a bonus, this type of story can /also/ come with a side dose of powerful characters, or groups of characters putting down Dumbledore, which can be extra jarring if the power and skill of those characters were not really well-grounded in the narrative beforehand.

The third case; the author doesn't want to write any of the above characterizations of Dumbledore, but they go the other way and completely shy away from the "Good is not soft" trope. This can result in a pretty good Dumbledore, one with flaws and character growth and everything, but, since it shies away from "Good is not soft", you won't get what you are looking for.

That said, Phoenix Insurgent, which someone else recommended above, might be right up your alley. Even though I do think it a bit weird that Dumbledore is so angry that Fudge tried to arrest him, when he made the whole DA debacle look like his responsibility, just so that Fudge would forget Harry and go after him.

*** Just saying, straight up this series has too many problems. What happens is authors try to be realistic about it, and place blame on the people who it should be on, if this actually happened. Ex. Dumbles is manipulative for letting Harry stay at the Durley"s. What actually happens is that it is universally treated as non-existent, because that's how the story is. If you want to blame anyone, blame the writer. However, the characters really can't be at fault for an action that was done by a writer. For example, while nowhere near fanon levels, canon abuse was still very significant. I don't know about you, but a cupboard under the stairs seems negligent, along with glasses with no prescription. That, along with bouts of near-starvation would physically and mentally stunt your growth. This just creates problems, with no answer. So the author of the fanfiction tries to place someone at blame, this is just a common result.

Linkffn(Community Service by Balthanon) is a nice one-shot that has Dumbledore taking advantage of the Wizengamot letting the Death Eaters off lightly at the end of the first war.

** This is because Dumbledore isn't actually a utilitarian. People who have problems with Dumbledore, usually just have problems with the manipulation and since the books have the phrase "for the greater good" written in them, they think this is Dumbledore's position. However, a rose by any other name would smell as sweet. Thus, there's lots of fanfics which have manipulative Dumbledores but few which involve a utilitarian with Dumbledore's power and knowledge. People recognise that this isn't actually how Dumbledore behaves... and, indeed, might not have a problem with him if it was. It is, therefore, not the behaviour/characterisation they want to condemn with their fic. Net result:

#+begin_quote
  "Let's rob, torment and manipulate a child, defend Death Eaters and not care who dies on the side of the "Light" whilst saying the Words ITS FOR THE GREATER GOOD" like some kind of evil card carrying meme.
#+end_quote

[[/u/starfox5][u/starfox5]] already mentioned a couple of their fics... their Dumbledores tend to get quite close to what you're looking for in the sense they do bad things or make hard decisions in service of a wider mission.

There's a fic that I can't remember the name of where Harry becomes a master warder or something. He basically manipulates Dumbledore into wiping the floor with everyone else... Dumbledore is kind of the power The Dark Lord knows not. In the end, though, Harry has to destroy Dumbledore's mind since he can't convince Dumbledore that he's no longer a Horcrux and, thus, Dumbledore will be gunning for Harry. And as good at warding as Harry is, he's not entirely convinced Dumbledore wouldn't eventually succeed. I think it might be Harry/Luna.

** Honestly, I don't like Dumbledore. But I DESPISE fics that have him all ‘Slytherin bad, greater good,etc.'

My fics main protagonist is Draco Malfoy, he's traveling back to the Marauders Era, Dumbledores a pretty big part of the fic.

But he's a MENTOR! And Draco also helps Dumbledore see how Slytherins think. They help each other!
