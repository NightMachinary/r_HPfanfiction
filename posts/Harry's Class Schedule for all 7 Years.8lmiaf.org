Does it exist? did anyone ever manage to calculate one fully? it seems quite complicated to work out, even a guess at one

*** That's pretty freaking cool. Though, aren't there supposed to be classes that overlap? That was why Hermione needed the Time Turner in third year, right?

**** You are correct... Searching for the Power is a 6th year fic, so I was not thinking about the overlapping classes issue.

Extend some of the shorter Arithmancy and Muggle Studies and Runes classes to be double periods or something and they would be overlapping core classes...

*** What about Saturday or Sunday.

I see no reason why Hogwarts wouldn't have classes every day of the week. Reasons detailed below :

- The weekend is a newer concept and didn't exist before 1900, statute of secrecy went into effect long before then.

- Hogwarts is a boarding school, and even some modern boarding schools have short days on the weekend

- Hogwarts is comprised of students across 7 years. Scheduling would be MUCH easier on a teacher if it was broken down as such :

- 

  - Each year level per one day of the week. (first years on monday, second years on tuesday, etc.)

- 

  - Pre-newt years (years 1 - 5) are broken into 2 sections, Gryffindors and Slytherins pre-lunch, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaws post-lunch

- 

  - Newt years (years 6 - 7) are combined into one class pre-lunch (due to class prerequisites filtering students out)

- 

  - Post-Lunch weekends are for quidditch matches and hogsmeade visits.

Obviously the above example can't apply across all subjects at the same time, but it at least shows how much scheduling stress can be alleviated by including the weekends.

**** By the same logic wizards are not farmers, so there's no need for summer vacation.\\
Also people can apparate there is no need for Hogwarts to be a boarding school at all.

***** Why wouldn't wizards have farms? The Weasley's have chickens, and Hagrid also had roosters / grew pumpkins. I don't think wizards are immune to needing manage farms and livestock. If anything, the fact that most don't have muggle money suggests that the wizarding community is entirely dependent on wizarding farms to get food.

Also, children aren't legally allowed to apparate, and it's also not a skill all adults have.

** The one I made for my fanfic does change a few things from canon, I gave McGonagall and Flitwick time-turners as they seem the most responsible, and some classes not specifically stated to be grouped together combine houses. I tried to follow what little canon information we have, but the inconsistency with regards to dates and days of the week and calendar info mean it's fairly. . . eh.

And even then, it was months of very annoying effort to get it to mesh properly. I didn't pay any attention to the supposed length of the subjects, so my times may be inaccurate or need tweaking on a case-by-case basis, but I don't care. It's good enough for me, and if anyone else would find it helpful go to it.

** It's impossible, unless you add more teachers or ignore a lot of other students, or give all staff Time-Turners. I mean, have you ever seen a school that serves ~250 students across 7 grades with one teacher per subject? Yeah, nope.

I just chalk it up to magic and move on. Besides, why would you need the class schedule? What boring story could possiby need one?

*** Just wanted to see if someone's calculated it accurately. A schedule is handed out, so knowing it makes for worldbuilding.

And to be fair, 20 Lesson slots a week, easy for Electives as your whole year takes them at a time (only 5 classes) NEWT would have the Whole year for every subject. (2 Classes) And pre OWL you have 2 separate groups per year (10 Classes total) so each teacher has 12 Classes for a Core Subject, and 5 for an Elective. Each class is a maximum of 90 minutes (Double Potions. Quote about it being an hour and a half of Snape)

It's possible, it just means the teacher gets literally no rest period, outside of the 10m breaks, and after the day has ended (which also has them marking homework etc)
