***** It sounds more like crack if you use the full definition Google gives

#+begin_quote
  treat (a sacred place or thing) with violent disrespect.
#+end_quote

"Sacred place" as a synonym is almost at the "My immortal" level. Alternatively, here is something if you "respect" a vagina.

#+begin_quote
  spoil (something which is valued or respected)
#+end_quote
