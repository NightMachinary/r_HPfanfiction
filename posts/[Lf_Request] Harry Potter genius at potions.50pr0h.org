Anyone know any fanfics where it focuses on where Harry Potter is great at potions. I'd perfer no slash and stories with 60,000+ words. Thanks ðŸ˜¬


** There is a series. There's no BwL and manipulative and sane-ish and much more political Tom Riddle. There's no Voldemort. It's F-Harry who is amazing at potions and is quite well written.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.
