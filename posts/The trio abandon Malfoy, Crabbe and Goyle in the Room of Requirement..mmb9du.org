** He knew that she could feel the steady pounding of life against his ribs.

“Is Draco alive? Is he in the castle?”

The whisper was barely audible; her lips were an inch from his ear, her head bent so low that her long hair shielded his face from the onlookers.

"LOL NOPE" Answered Harry

** Are you just looking for one in which they are abandoned and nothing else changes? Because that wouldn't have much of an effect on the plot if Harry possessed enough sense to lie to Narcissa

*** Isn't Narcissa a legilimens or is that fanon? Harry isn't that great a liar anyway, probably ends in dead Harry for real.

**** No that's complete fanon, there's nothing even hinting at that being true. Also Harry was a good enough liar to hide what Umbridge was doing to him from Ron and Hermione, it would not be hard at all to simply whisper out ‘Yes' to her, especially considering his eyes are closed and face blank.

I don't think that counts quite so much as they knew something was up, they just didn't really push since they were friends and didn't expect a teacher to straight up torture a student. And a single example anyway.

****** All he had to do was whisper one word to Narcissa. He didn't need to make up a plausible explanation. It really isn't that hard to whisper ‘yes'. Even lying to his friends about Umbridge takes more skill than that.
