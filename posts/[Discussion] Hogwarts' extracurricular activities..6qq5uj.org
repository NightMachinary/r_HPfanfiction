A reply from [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6qn52v/ways_wizards_had_it_worse_than_muggles_in_the/][this topic]] makes me question this. So far in canon all the clubs or teams for such activities in Hogwarts are Houses' Quidditch teams and Gobstones club, maybe even the DA and Slugs' Club if we stretch it. Is it because Harry is a horrible narrator? Or Hogwarts truly is such a dull place after the wonder of magic has worn off?

Even the non-club activities are few: Chess, Exploding Snap, music and reading, caring for the plants in the greenhouse (only have heard of Neville doing this), secret (or not so much) rendezvous in various broom closets around the castle... And what else? A bunch of teens spending seven years of their youth there, so there should be a lot more things to kill time with.

Fanon activities are fine too, as long as it's not too outrageous.


** Charms club is mentioned at one point as well. That implies that there are clubs for other classes as well.

** I read a fic that had a music club, where there were instruments for students to play in their spare time. I really liked that idea.

It's canon that there's a choir - we see them in the movies, although I can't remember if they're mentioned in the books.

*** In one of the Harry Potter video games for Gameboy Color (either SS or CoS), there was a music room in the castle, complete with music stands and chairs. I remember this because I was highly involved in music as a kid, and it stood out to me.

** Something about magical musical instruments really gets me excited. We don't get to see much of the music in wizarding world barring Celestina Warbeck, The Wierd Sisters, and the mention of Stubby Boardman and the Hobgoblins, and many fanfics display the music as old fashioned music. But i really think there's some potential there. Music being so powerful that it can help people fight duels, it being a whole new branch of magic is really exciting. I like to imagine there being a choir in hogwarts, or something akin to that, a room from where melodious tunes play, something that relaxes people even if they're just walking past that corridoor. It's really magical.

*** I don't think they're old-fashioned. This comes with the whole "The Wizarding World is stuck in the past" notion. During the Yule Ball, The Weird Sisters managed to play both gentle melody to set the romantic mood and what seemed to be a kind of pop or rock song to heat up the atmosphere, no? Or that was just a piece of fanon?

**** Yeah, it was the movies i think, in the books they are just mentioned. I'm not sure. But yeah, sometimes people take the whole stuck in eighties thing way too far. And sometimes the characters are into muggle music from the early twenty-first century. But i like to imagine wizarding music being it's own thing. Something really different, something awesome.

***** honestly with magic you don't really need muggle studio tracking because you can just have the instruments play magically, and maybe record that and see what its like, therefore making musical layering a lot easier.

*** In the third film, the Hogwarts Choir performs. And they're really good for not having practiced together all summer.

Or, it just occurred to me, maybe they get to campus early to prepare their song? It would be kind of like band camp. That would be a fun setting for a fic, though you'd probably have to drop in more OCs than most people are comfortable with.

** I think Rowling has stated that there is an art class where they can learn how to make moving paintings, but Harry wasn't interested so it was never mentioned.

There was also apparently a failed drama club at some point.

**** Well I know the failed drama club is mentioned in the book of wizarding world fairytales, The Tales of Beedle the Bard. There was an attempt to put on a play from one of the stories in it (the one with the knights). I think its mentioned in a footnote?

Here it is: [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/event/hogwarts-presents-a-pantomime-of-fountain-of-fair-fortune/]]

I think the art club is mentioned in pottermore in a few small aside? Does anyone else know?

Edit: I might be mis-remembering a fact from one of the Harry Potter games. [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Art]]

** I always imagined that at some point during OWL year, children would also find out their 'Specialization' and in turn would get more of a certain class or have a new one altogether based on certain 'groups' of Magic (Mind Magic/Psychic Magic/Divination, Elemental Magic, etc...) This would, in turn, spawn clubs where Children talked about their different innate abilities and learned more about them.

So for Tonks, being naturally a 'Metamorphmagus' would be more of her having an extremely rare affinity and ability over her own body that few others have. I have no idea of the nuances of this, but it sounded cool in my head.

Duelling Club also seemed like a 'must' for Hogwarts, I can't imagine a society where Power is so coveted not valuing pure displays of Power against Power against Wit against Ability.

You could be right, but I just personally thought that Duelling could be a way to bring other schools into this. Instead of multiple Quidditch teams, Hogwarts has one Duelling team that goes against other School's Duelling teams. I can't see how anyone is going to win against Durmstrang if they don't at least have a Duelling Club.

** My head-canon is that the Chamber of Secrets was cleared out after the war, and turned into a large indoor swimming area for extracurricular as well as optional phys-ed classes. A side branch would also be underwater dueling, the appropriate magic equivalent to underwater basket weaving.
