Hi, i'm looking for some recommendations for fics that are told from an “outsider's” perspective, so to speak. A more or less grown up person (muggle or magical) with no prior knowledge of the wizarding world discovering it, and the majority of the plot not happening at hogwarts.

- please no bashing
- decent grammar
- no black/white characters

some examples i really enjoyed:

Thanks!


** Linkao3(strangers are drakshaugh) might not be what you're exactly asking for, but it's a canon compliant fic from the perspective of a muggle of the Potter family.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8864658/1/]]

This is the story of Petunia, developing magic as an adult, and becoming a part of the Magical World. It's very well, written, well-done Severitus with a twist, and currently 142 chapters.

She's far from perfect, but develops into a more well-rounded character than the books.

  Mrs Miller is perfectly happy with her orderly neighbourhood and is sure that everyone else, including Mr Miller, agrees with her. But when old Mr Fletcher dies and leaves number eleven unoccupied, who will move in there next? A story of Hermione and Sirius moving into a new home told from the perspective of their new neighbour, who is less than thrilled.
