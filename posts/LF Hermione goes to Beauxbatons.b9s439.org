I believe in the fic she is cousins with the Delacours, and meets Harry Potter post-Voldemort. H/HR, Harry is an ass.

(Also if you have recs for similar fics hmu!)


** Teacher's Pet on Portkey is like that, minus the cousin and the being an ass thing.

#+begin_quote
  As a cousin of Gabrielle and Fleur Delacour, Hermione studied in France. Because Hermione never went to Hogwarts, things changed. Some people who died now live and others who lived are dead. Now a new evil stalks Britain as children disappear from their homes. Harry and Hermione meet for the first time, finding themselves in the middle of the mystery as they struggle to trust each other and protect the ones they love. Will Hermione's mysterious past prove the key to save them all? Or will it lead to their destruction?
