By 'overall fics' I mean most or all of their fics were enjoyable or readable.

Personally, I go to little0bird for all my H/G needs. Best worldbuilding and character, period. Northumbrian isn't bad, but loses out because frankly his Muggle OCs are better written than canon characters, and Deadwoodpecker unfortunately has too many abandoned fics.

For crossover/non-H/G content, Darth Marrs is hands down the best I've seen. Excellent storycrafting and personality building, and the Firebird Trilogy is the only smutless multi I have yet to encounter that also held my interests. Crossover wise, I really like that no in-depth knowledge of the other world is needed to enjoy it. The Katarn Side is my favourite SW/HP fic.


** In terms of worldbuilding, I really like Taure's work (except for the fact when a lot of it is unfinished :(( )

The Sinister Man really only has one major fic, Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin, but it's got all of my favorite stuff in there -- politics and worldbuilding.

I've also enjoyed Flye Autumne's Chessmaster series, which, again, features politics and some worldbuilding.

** There's no competition, it's got to be The Carnivorous Muffin. So, so many amazing fics linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus; Minato Namikaze and the Destroyer of Worlds; October; The Unwinding Golden Thread; Wearing the Faces of Men) and so so many great side fics.

Nonjon is also great, and I enjoy Rorschach's Blot too.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

Jbern has an interesting take on the tri-wizard tournament in linkffn(The Lie I've Lived) . But if you want a well done dimension hopping crackfic, I recommend Nonjon's linkffn(A Black Comedy) .

On the other hand whilst I really enjoy much of Joe6991's work I can't make them an overall favourite on the basis of his work's, because of some of the flaws in his early trilogy.

******* The fact that there are worse stories than the ones Robst writes doesn't constitute that Robst's stories are good.

****** I liked Harry Crow. I didn't like amidst the vaults of stone that everyone says is so much better. People have different opinions, but on ff HC has 20k favs and AtVoS has 3.6k favs. There is a reason for that.

******* Adam Sandler movies are also very often box office hits but that doesn't make them quality films.

Harry Crow is easy to digest using nothing but overused tropes that we've seen and are comfortable with.

Lord Potter

pretentious speaking main character whose attempting to sound professional and mature,

self righteous Mc with no intelligent foes that overendulges in long winded speeches to put them "in their place"

Harry Crow is at its core a power fantasy, and people will always favorite a power fantasy.

******** This is exactly why i like Robst.. Not every single movie on this planet needs to be a cinematic masterpiece along the lines of Citizen Kane or Gone with the Wind.. Sometimes i just want to watch Transformers or Fast & Furious.. the same thing holds true for fanfiction, or any other media you can think of.. so his fics absolutely have their place.. and i can't stand the assholish, elitist, superior attitudes of 85% of people in here when someone dares to mention his name.. Christ..

********* And your ability to enjoy something isn't the standard for everyone else. You may not need high fidelity and originality in stories to be entertained by something but some of us do.

It's not elitist to have different taste and a dislike for someone's work, just having certain standards for something we consume and publicly stating that isn't elitist. The idea that you are calling people elitist for disliking something that you just compared with films people call "popcorn flicks" or "mindless entertainment" is utterly ridiculous, almost to the point where I want to call it "counter-elitism".

********** It is equally ridiculous to me that it's damn near impossible to mention the man's name without several someones wishing to curb stomp people for daring to like an apparently sub-par author.. The mere fact that mentioning Robst's name makes people want to scream at me for enjoying his fics is what makes it seem like a lot of assholes and elitist smug people frequent this place.. Especially considering that the question simply was what authors we enjoyed.. Apparently my opinion on the matter is wrong.. Thus the elitism.. A lot of the crap that he gets from here seems to be, Stop liking what i don't like.. at least from some of the people on here.. Which is what gets on my tits..

*********** I agree, man. I can't read his stuff now but it's what got me into the fandom. Like what you like and don't worry what others like. Stomping on authors for writing what they write or fans for liking what they like is oxymoronic in a fanfiction community, IMHO. E.g. I know Starfox5 is raved about but I can't get into his works even though I've tried many times. Doesn't mean they're a terrible author, just that I have different taste. Each to their own...
