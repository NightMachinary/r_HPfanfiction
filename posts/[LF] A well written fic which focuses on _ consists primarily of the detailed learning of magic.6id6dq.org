I realize this request may sound absurd given that this is Harry Potter, but in reading many fics I've noticed precious few spend almost any time exploring characters learning magic. For me one of the real draws of HP is when characters are forced to learn and grow in ways the reader can observe and relate to, such as the classes the golden trio took in the Sorcerer's Stone which aided them in thwarting Voldemort.

To provide some context two fanfics which did this quite well are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11160991/1/0800-Rent-A-Hero][1-800-Rent-A-Hero]] by brainthief wherein Harry essentially stumbles on to the fact that Divination is a useful branch of magic, as well as [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11898648/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Rune-Stone-Path][Harry Potter & the Rune Stone Path]] by Temporal Knight which has Harry becoming a Runes expert and was quite enjoyable until the angst/Harem-focus broke the spell for me.

Any and all suggestions are welcome!

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret. In the meantime, Chief-wizard Malfoy has his eyes set on Hogwarts, and only Sir Albus stands in his way.

** [[http://tinyurl.com/jkc2qeu][Alexandra Potter]] - The first year of Girl-Who-Lived in a more magical Hogwarts. It focuses on school life and author's variation on magic system. Only the first year is complete, but it stands on its own and theoretically, there is a new version planned. With theoretically being the key word here.

Original Description:

#+begin_quote
  First year fem!Harry AU. Alexandra Potter has finally come to Hogwarts, where she will meet new friends and discover a world of magic. But will an escalating rivalry threaten all that she's built? Character-driven story, lots of world building. No canon rehash, no bashing.

** In my story "Patron", the main characters spend some time learning sympathetic magic and creating rituals (in a race against each other). It's a crucial part of the plot, but I'd not say that it's the focus of the story.

*** Thanks for the link, I skimmed the beginning and it looks solid so far - neat premise too on the scarcity of muggleborns!

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
