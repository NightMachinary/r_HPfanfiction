If I were a wizard, one of my first calls to order would be learning the patronus charm and trying to convince all my friends to learn it. While the argument could be made that it's unnecessary for wizard's day to day life as dementors are rarely an issue, this cannot be applied to the HP world. Alright, years 1 and 2 no need to learn the patronus - you might not even know what a dementor is! However, once you get to third year and dementors are quite literally swarming your school (and have gone against orders and attacked Harry Potter on the grounds!) how is it possible that you don't buckle down and determine to learn a spell that protects you from your literal soul being sucked out??

** Well most of the young students (especially muggle borns and muggle raised ones) had no idea what dementors were at first or that even such a charm existed, since it's only taught much later.

I get your point that you would want to learn it, because we readers are really curious about the wizarding world but for the students it's not the same. We are reading about this amazing word with magic and spells etc, meanwhile for them it's their normal life. It's like if you were in middle school, and knew there was some nice formula in maths that would help you solve a problem, most students wouldn't bother learning it in middle school because they know they'll eventually learn it in highschool. Those for example of your grade who are in the maths club could maybe learn it since they do things more advanced in their club ( that would be Harry's case in the Harry potter books ) but the rest of your year won't really bother with it.

** Hogwarts is right next to a lac, why don't you learn the BubbleHead charm? You could drown!\\
Everyone is eating right next to each other in the Great Hall, why don't you always keep some antidote with you all the time? You could be poisoned!\\
Have you seen these stairs? You should totally learn the "/Arresto Momentum/" spell, unless you want to break your neck after a fall?\\
Did I either mention that one class of the core curriculum asks the students to stay next to some kind of semi sentient plants that totally want to kill them? While an option ask them to do the same thing with magical beast? And that's without even mentioning all the possible accidents that could happen in classes like Transfiguration and Potion.\\
There are a lot of arguments at Hogwarts. What if a student decided to curse you in the back?You should learn Defense!\\
Have you heard about the Unforgiveable? Do you think conjuring a slab of rock in front of the spell could stop it? Maybe I should learn it, just in case.

There are /a lot/ of possible way to die in the Magical World. And I would not even rank the Dementor Kiss in the top 10 or the most probable (or even 50). People can't protect themselves against everything and most of them are already working very hard to not fall behind with the normal classes, they can't take side projet like learning the Patronus.

**** The only student that was "traumatised" by the dementors is Harry, who was a lot more affected by their presence due to his story. I guess some unmentionned student may also have been hit pretty hard, but the point is that they are not the norm.

For most of the student, the nearby presence of a dementor means being cold, and feeling as if you would never be happy again. Not a good sensation to have, but most of them probably felt the same thing after one potion class with Snape so it's not like there is something to worry about.

***** There's people claiming this pandemic is traumatic for them, even though they don't know anyone who's died or even gotten sick. Something that reaches into your head to hurt you and could potentially eat your soul and attacks your classmate repeatedly would be much worse than people you don't know getting pneumonia.

******* That's a Doylist answer that makes no sense in world or in character. It's equivalent to saying, "they don't know or want to know how to defend themselves because the author doesn't want them to, since it would make telling the story harder."

********* And that's a terrible reason. Characters should do what is realistic for them to want to do, not obey the hands of an invisible puppet master who just moves them around like props on a stage. If a reader can't put themselves into the head of a character and think, "Given everything that's going on, is this something reasonable for me to do (or not do)?" and answer "Yes", then the character is badly written.

I mean, yes, you're right, the reason that nobody learned or even seemed to want to learn the Patronus charm even with Dementors around the school who had ATTACKED STUDENTS twice is clearly that JKR didn't want to write it that way. But that's the same thing as saying that she's a bad writer since that decision makes no sense whatsoever in-character. Good writers get into the head of their characters, and frequently say that the character does things that they hadn't actually intended. Bad writers treat characters the same as they do props. JKR is a bad writer.

** Wizards are generally pretty indolent people. Most of them had lived through two wars and barely bothered to learn a shield charm, which isn't described as being as difficult as the Patronus is. If they won't learn a comparatively basic shield charm, they're properly not going to bother putting in the effort to learn something described as incredibly difficult.

It could make the spell more popular after the war if people learnt about it though.
