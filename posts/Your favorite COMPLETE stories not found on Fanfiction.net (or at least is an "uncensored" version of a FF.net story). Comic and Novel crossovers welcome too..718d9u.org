Archive of Our Own, Dark Lord Potter forums, whatever. As long as it's complete. Crossovers are great, but I'd prefer either comic book (DC, Marvel, etc) or novel crossovers, as I don't know much about anime or play many video games.


** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] and its sequel [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-28614/DianeCastle+The+Secret+Return+of+Alex+Mack.htm#pt][The Secret Return of Alex Mack]].

Also from the same author: [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-27958/DianeCastle+Harry+Potter+and+the+Deadly+Heller.htm#pt][Harry Potter and the Deadly Heller]], a Year 7 AU crossover with Buffy the Vampire Slayer in which Ginny gained Slayer power and Voldemort countered with an additional demonic army.

Other non FFN favorites include Esama's [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/205025][Island of Fire Series]] and annerb's [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8941561/chapters/20467861][half awake and almost there]].

** Anything by [[http://keiramarcos.com/category/fandom/harry-potter/][Keira Marcos]]. She doesn't post incomplete fic to that site.

And I mean literally anything, though I linked to the HP page considering where we are.
