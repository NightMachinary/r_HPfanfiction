It is such an intriguing and interesting fanfic to be honest.

The first five chapters are pretty funny especially when Gordon calls out Snape for his teaching skills. Then it develops a plot and then oh my god O.C's galore. There's a lot of LGBT+ representation which was unexpected but great lol. I guess you could describe it as serious fantasy but like woah where did all this stuff come from. Very satisfying conclusion and to be honest it's not actually focused on Harry that much! It's awesome. It's 300k words.

I think everyone should see it because it's so great.


** It was quite the journey. I fully expected it to make me drool, it succeeded, but I didn't expect the ending to be so goshdarn bittersweet it made me cry. Real gem though, can't complain.

The genre shift was somewhat expected, though. Comes with the territory and all that.

** I was completely blown away. I expected it to be funny and semi-cracky but I did /not/ expect to care about the characters and storyline as much as I did. I remember crying a /lot/ before the end because it was just all so well done. I recommend it as often as possible.

** It starts as crack and then goes deep into war atrocities. You need tissues to read that.

** Anyone else read the title for this post as "Harry Potter and the Rack of Lamb Sauce?" No? I did, because reading is hard.
