Where the Weasleys, usually led by Ron and/or Molly, are angry at her or become angry at her, usually crossing into verbal physical or sexual assault. Harry sides with Ron, then Kingsley and/or McGonagall turn on her, etc.

********* Aah ok. So that did kinda happen with a character in Bespoke Witch (but was completely justified and well fleshed out, not 'bashing' as such). I won't say who as to not ruin the plot if you ever decide to read. It was only one character too, and the people around them are supportive of them (should mention, Bespoke Witch is a Hermione is wife to House of Malfoy story, aka both Draco and Lucius, but not in a threesome way)

So far in Rivers that not any sort of bashing that I can tell will happen. Hermione / Draco and all the characters around them are very realistically flawed and hurt as they should be after a magical war. And it ain't 'pretty flaws' in all honesty.

  "With knowledge, there is always hope," the woman contended in a tone that brooked no argument; despite her brave countenance, her eyes were bright with tears. "And right now that's all we have. Now what news of Hermione do you have for us today?" The war is over, but the battle continues: choice vs. duty. Hermione struggles to remain afloat as Draco seeks a safe port.

  Latin; a dead language with no practical applications except perhaps the deciphering of old texts and as a particularly quaint party trick. Thankfully, as Harry finds out, Latin is not as dead as he was first taught when he decided to learn the language. It wouldn't have mattered anyway, of course; he loved Latin, and would have been proud to know it even had it been as useless as it was pretty. But in the world of Wizards, the world of Magic, Harry realizes his rare talent with words is particularly valuable in the highly complicated and controversial subject of Spell Creation, a subject he soon becomes enamored with despite having to hide his interest from everyone. Besides, it's not like he's going Dark, after all.

  War was never something that was finished in a day, but for Harry Potter, his life seemed to fall apart in one.Death's master was not a title anyone would want if they knew the consequences, but Harry didn't know this, being busy with his trying to stay alive in the midst of a war.So when the Hallows claim him as their Master, what's he to do but go a little insane?
