  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny

*** Wind Shear doesn't bash Dumbledore. MC points out the shortcomings of his approach and the incorrectness of a number of assumptions he was proceeding on. Not entirely politely, it has to be said, but nevertheless within the broader bounds of civility.

**** You're not wrong, but you'd be surprised how many people take any valid criticism of Dumbledore (especially) as equivalent to bashing. The response is almost cult-like.

***** I forget which of the Black Queen series it's in*, but Silently Watches has the protagonist point out the way people behave around Dumbledore in-story (and to a considerable extent, in canon) to Mr. and Mrs. Granger.

"Good lord, our daughter has joined a /cult/."

*Not linking it. Those stories are brilliantly written, but the kind of strong medicine that causes the immune-to-nuance to come over all vaporous and clutch their pearls.

****** Very true. You see it so clearly in canon; no one, adult or child, even bothers to truly question or protest Dumbledore's insane decisions. I've made a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPharmony/comments/jbnt4x/-/g8x4avp][not-comprehensive list.]]

Agreed. I haven't read them myself but I wanted to read this particular conversation so I went searching through Google. It's chapter 12 of /The Black Queen's War./
