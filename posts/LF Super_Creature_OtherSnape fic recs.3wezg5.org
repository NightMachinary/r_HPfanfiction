There's lots of Super!Harrys, Creature!Harrys, and the like. I want some recs of Snape.

There was one I read ages ago where his father (I think) made him drink a potion out of a goblet with a moonstone base and it started changing him. But that got abandoned.

The more inhuman the mindset, the better


** He's a Dragon in "On Crimson Wings"... but the story's not about him.

  Hermione's eyes brimmed with tears. That sounded... romantic! But it was impossible, a gruff and familiar voice told her, though she couldn't place it. No, the Boy-Who-Lived was too good for her, she wasn't worthy of someone like him, she'd have to settle for the sidekick...

And I noped the fuck out.

  Response to GoldenSteel's My gf is a what? challenge. GoF: Hermione has a secret. One that even she doesn't know. When she unearths a highly dangerous ritual to help Harry in the first task, the two of them never expected that secret to hit them both and change them into Great Dragons! Are they doomed to be treated as beasts? What does this mean for the TWT? H/Hr; AD/RW/MW putdown.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1386923/Snapegirlkmf][Snapegirlkmf]] has a few Severitus fics where she works in a lot of different mythologies, and Snape's usually not all human. They can get a little repetitive, but I enjoy them.
