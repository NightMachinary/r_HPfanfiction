I got a lot of, let's say, flak when I initially posted my ideas.

I got genuine criticism and helpful advice! Love that

Then there were... less than helpful comments. Moreso /this is shit, what are you doing/. Sometimes sprinkled with actual points but I discounted them because other people had made them and managed not to be dicks about it.

Very fun to read. But I was really thankful for those who took me seriously! You're great and I feel kinda bad for dropping your ideas in wake of the negativity. I'll definitely revisit the original concept when I have more time to sus it out. This idea gives me more freedom.

/As I'm writing this, there is a 70 paged powerpoint covering the details of eight planned chapters. There will be more./

*What's Changed*

- *It's a different time period!* Tom Riddle fics got me invested in this fandom so I'm gonna give back to the inspiration.

*What's Not Changed*

- *Still having my protagonists as Harry, Hermione and Draco.* Why? Well, it's not for the romance as some speculated because this will most likely be a gen fic. I know a lot of you nice people really wanted me to incorporate Ron still! And I'm sorry, but I will acknowledge how awful it will be without him for the duo. I wanted Draco for the dynamic it would create. Taking away their bestie and slotting in their enemy.
- *New Bodies.* It starts with them being sent back via the room of requirement during the fiendfyre event. (That part may change, we'll see, don't have any other ideas yet) Not gonna go into explaining the how and why here, this is already a lengthy post. They take over the lives of three people who lived during the time but didn't attend Hogwarts (backstory covers this and is different for each character). During the attack they are launched into, their guardians die along with many others and 'amnesia' from an unknown foreign spell is used as speculation for why they supposedly don't know who they are.
- *Ravenclaw Muggleborn Draco, Slytherin Pureblood Hermione and Hufflepuff Half-blood Harry.* (Part of the reason we have Draco here) (Harry fights for his friends, Draco has lost his old ambitions and Hermione is at the forefront of scheming to take down Riddle)
- *They're not gonna be Gary and Mary Stus*
- *They go back to the fourth year* (but after the Christmas holidays this time)

*Points Made Last Time by You Guys*

/The Points I thought were good and still apply to this version (Summarised)/

- *Instant Friendship* - Avoiding making these three friends all of a sudden when they've got such a backlog of issues. It's gonna be a long fic.
- *PTSD* - They're going from a war to school years. Need to address this appropriately.
- *No Bashing* - I'm not going to be doing any bashing.
- *Dumbledore* - Well, this point is very different here. But I need to decide whether there's that trust and how they're going to approach him
- *Draco doesn't want Voldemort* - I agree with this
- *Believable Reasoning for Draco's Change in Belief* - Him having to pose as a muggleborn and being treated as a mudblood by people of the house he used to be a part of will help this. But then there's also going to be a muggleborn Slytherin he ends up connecting with to further embellish this. Plus I think by now he's realised being with Voldemort is kinda: /Do what I say or be punished/. From what we see anyway.
- *Use different time* - Did this! Didn't think I would but I did!
- *Harry doesn't know he's set to die yet* - We Love Dumbledore In This House
- *Time Travel or Dimension Travel?* - ehhhh, gonna ignore the canon PoA rules on time travel. Nothing is set in stone. Think I'll go with time travel. Not gonna think too hard there.

/Reasonable Points I'm discounting from last time (Summarised)/

- *Don't use Draco* - Sorry, I understand where this point is coming from but I'm set.
- *Draco goes Back to Voldemort* - Now, if it were the original idea, I would totally discount this. But at the minute, I think he might have a bit of something about Riddle, and later tries to escape it. Still thinking on that.
- *Ron* - I'm really sorry. I don't dislike him or anything! Just as much as he's not my favourite either! I just want this.
- *Be Unique and Use different characters* - I might do that another time, but this is my first HP fanfic so I'm playing it somewhat safe (she says, embarking on a long fic that was generally thought as Not The Best Idea)

Most other things can be explained by /The Magic of Fan Fiction/ or I've just missed them or they were kinda unreasonable.

Aaaand, you just opened Pandora's box. Fuck Tom Riddle, any time travellers in the 1930/40s have bigger issues to worry about, namely, that thing called second world war. The few hundred or even thousand deaths in magical Britain are irrelevant compared to the 50 million in Europe during the war. And besides, how would time travellers from 1998 struggle with Tom Riddle? Just kill him in his sleep and be done with it, he is too dangerous to be left alive. Neither Harry nor Hermione would hesitate to strike him down knowing what he would become (and that he would start a Muggleborn Holocaust).

*** If you're down for murder sure!

And the deaths of the people during the world war are very serious yes, but they don't know them at the end of the day. It's that whole ethical dilemma of would you save the ten strangers or a couple of people you care about? It's hard. Plus, they may not necessarily be in the best position to aid the war. While fantastic Beasts hasn't run it's course, most people are sticking to the idea that Grindlewald didn't really breach the British Shore full scale if at all because of Dumbledore. It'll be a running theme but not the focus.

I don't know if you've read many time travel fics to Tom Riddle's era, but generally the first thing on the list isn't murder. There's a lot of ideals at play: the human right to live, stooping to the same level as the enemy, Riddle technically hasn't done anything yet, trying to get away with murder is difficult, the potential to steer him off his path, he isn't fully insane yet, the potential to sympathise with him, just not wanting to kill people etc. The too dangerous to live concept is quite extreme, placing one person as the judge jury and executioner, as any good death penalty debate would highlight.

Plus I don't think there really would a story if I just killed Riddle immediately. No tension, no stakes. A failed attempt? Maybe. The answer here would be to not write about Riddle. But I want to. So I will.

#+end_quote

In the magical world it is ridicilously easy. Transfigure the body into a stick, toss it in the forest. Transfigure it into a stone and toss it in the lake, or even better, apparate to Orkney and do it there. We are talking about 1998 Harry and Hermione. They went through a civil war. Riddle literally copied Nazi Laws. He already torments kids, and if it is after his 6th year, he killed four people (3 counts of murder, 1 of manslaughter), so it would not be unreasonable.

Hermione led Umbridge into a Centaur gang rape (although she probably intended "squished by a giant") and did not bat an eye. She had no issues with cursing the DA list. Harry lost his parents to Voldemort. They have more than enough personal reasons to do just that.

#+begin_quote

I guarantee that Hermione has read more than one book about the war, and there's bound to be some very explicit stuff about the Death Camps in there. No way Miss SPEW would let the Holocaust play out while she twiddles her thumbs.

***** The problem here would be to suggest that the aurors are bad at their jobs. I'm running with the assumption that the wizarding law enforcement have counter measures. People dying without consequence so much seems quite impractical in a governed fictional society with a justice system. Investigations using veritserum, the ability to read minds, collectible memories etc. And that's just what's explored in the books. Not to mention other authors suggestions and the like. Not sure if the checking of the last spells a wand used is a canon thing or not but it would help.

Going from manslaughter to murder is quite the leap. The Umbridge event itself was more of a "save or do nothing" scenario. Honestly I wouldn't save her, karma if anything. Doesn't mean she's ready to actively commit murder. And who was she to stand against an army of centaurs? And cursing the DA list with pimples is far from murder. Awful but not murder. Also their reasons for motive do apply yes but see my list again. To be a victim is one thing. To be a victim and then become a perpetrator is another. There never were many deaths in the Harry Potter series as a result of the light side I feel. Even Voldemort was inevitable, not a choice. I'd like to stick to the sort of narrative the canon has set up where it fits.

Of course Hermione will know, probably Harry too. But Hitler is not a wizard and they are 14, even if they are mentally older. If you wanted to fight against the Germans and their allies in world war two, you enlisted and became a soldier. Sure they have magic but what are they gonna do? Hop to Germany for an assassination? Also it's world history. Who knows what could happen of they end the war early. Their motives to deal with Riddle tie into goals they already had. The world war will end without their help. The wizarding war won't. Or at least, that's what they've been lead to believe.

Plus if I wanted to write a fic about Hermione sniping Hitler I would but I don't.

******* In real life some people get away with murder. Just because there was one isolated account doesn't mean it applies to every single instance. In other cases where people do get away with murder in the series there's always been /someone/ who gets incarcerated. Hagrid twice for Riddle and Siriuis for Pettigrew and in these instances there was a sense of logic too. I think if this plot hole were to exist, people would be constantly disappearing, which doesn't happen. Plus, this is fanfic, if I think something is a bit idiotic I change it. Use a freaking "Point Me" to find a transfigured body. There's always work arounds and I'm going to write the law enforcement department as competent, because I can.

Say what you want about centaurs, but it's an army. Sometimes you don't need skill, you need sheer numbers. How many individuals do you think two 15 year olds can take on at the same time exactly? I'm not writing Mary and Gary Stus here.

Why not? Because uh, I don't want to write a story about Hermione sniping Hitler. Do you know how just stupid it would be for me to write that story? A random British 18 year old taking the holocaust and ending it with a magical girl. There's some things You Just Don't Do. I'm in no position to take such a sensitive topic and fuck with it like that.

And as for the deaths. Refer to my last paragraph in which I detail why they aren't in any position to help out. The most feasible option would be for them to drop out of school and join the army. Or get into politics. Neither of which they can do due to their age and Hermione due to the gender climate. Plus they can't use magic in front of muggles and it's a muggle war. And underage magic. And popping to Germany would be difficult. Funding, lodging, supplies, connections etc. It's just not realistic in this scenario.

As for the "just kill riddle" refer to my first explanation. I give numerous reasons in my list and The "etc." Implies that I have more, btw.

At the end of the day, you don't like my base ideas, whether it's this one or the last one and there's no convincing you that /it's okay for Hermione not to want to murder people/. And I'm just not writing about Hermione sniping Hitler, I don't think I need /more/ reasons than I've already stated to explain why that's just A Bad Idea.

It's going to be written whether you like it or not. Criticism that does essentially boil down to "your idea doesn't work" as a whole shall be ignored because that would mean scrapping the entire fic /again/ which I'm not doing. Other people /are/ interested and Hermione traveling to Riddles period is Not A New Thing. Other people have done and managed to not turn it into a one man take down of Hitler.

I'll post the link when it's posted and you can bash it there.

The Centaurs are definitely far from Army strength (which would mean tens of thousands). Easiest solution would be to unleash Fiendfyre and Apparate away (Hermione knows the spell). Or vanish some dirt to create a foxhole, then one person casts a shield charm or transfigures a roof while the other throws blasting curses around. Summon a machine gun, set it up and mow them down if you have time to prepare. Use Harry's invisibly cloak to pick them off one by one.

That was well said. I'm not so sure that Hermione or Harry would outright kill Voldemort when he is still a child (there are many ways in which he could take a different direction with his life still), but they are definitely not going to give him the benefit of the doubt and try to see the good in him. I really don't get this obsession of people who write Riddle fics with trying to find some kind of way how their characters can sympathize (ugh, I'm going to be sick) with Riddle. I hate few things more than Harry desperately looking for ways in which he could become buddies with the guy who's going to kill his parents and bring untold misery in his (and his friends') life.

Harry and Hermione know that he's supposed to be charismatic and that he might try to win them over. They are not going to fall for that.

If you're a muggleborn or muggle-raised wizard and manage to go back to the 1930s, only a complete and utter psychopath or Nazi wouldn't stop WW2. Only a despicable waste of air would do nothing, or play around in the magical world, when fifty million civilians are about to get massacred.

******** If your Harry and Hermione won't care about 50 million deaths, then they aren't the characters we know. And with magic, it's very feasible - even informing the muggle Prime Minister and telling him what they know might tip the scales and prevent the war - or end it early.

You don't even have to write it out - merely a paragraph or two about them doing something will avoid that character-destroying inactivity.

That doesn't solve the "we won't kill Riddle" problem, of course. Telling Dumbledore would solve it - but if people were using the obvious and smart option, most time-travel stories would end very quickly. However, you need to find a very good excuse why Harry and Hermione would risk innocent lives and let Tom get not just to Hogwarts, but get the basilisk - and let Riddle frame Hagrid. If they cannot even stop a muggle, why do they think they can stop a genius dark wizard?

********** If you can stop Riddle, you can derail the Holocaust as well. Unless in your story, Grindelwald is behind that.

The problem is that while the Holocaust is a very sensitive subject, "killing Hitler" is the default answer to "What would you do with a time-travelling machine?" for good reason. It's a character-defining problem you cannot ignore. Compared to WW2's atrocities, Voldemort's crimes are a nuisance. Any character travelling to the 1930s focusing on Riddle instead of on Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan has to ask themselves why they value a few hundred or thousand wizards more than millions of muggles.

Just imagine yourself, in their place. Condemning millions to be murdered because you want to focus on dealing with one dark wizard. Imagine reading about the war while you mess around in Hogwarts. Imagine caring about House-Elf slavery - but not about the millions of people being worked to death. Imagine spending most of your time and effort to deal with Riddle - and actually making your goal more difficult by trying to save his life instead of killing the scumbag - while countless lives are destroyed.

I really, really don't see Hermione, Harry or anyone with a conscience and a brain fuck around at Hogwarts, trying to ineffectively deal with Riddle, with that going on. There's something like priorities.

And, unfortunately, "we cannot kill Riddle. We cannot tell Dumbledore" is a rather untenable position once you have either killed Hitler or informed the PM to stop/change WW2.

I can understand you want to write your story, and I support that - but you might want to change your story's background so your character's morals aren't proven to be fucked up and wrong by WW2. Perhaps have your characters land in a world where WW2 isn't about to happen - where WW1 ended differently, or there was no great depression, no Nazi Party in power?

A world that won't tell your characters each time they open a muggle newspaper to get over their shitty issues and kill Riddle before he murders people?

In short, if you don't want your characters to murder Riddle, I'd consider writing a world that supports that decision instead of disproving it. Getting rid of WW2 and the Nazis before the characters even arrive - perhaps show how Hitler was stopped by other Germans - might show that you can deal with Riddle without murdering him.

Edit: I do this - changing canon - with house-elves in my recent stories, retconning them into servants, not slaves, when I don't want to deal with slavery in the story and don't want Hermione and anyone else with a conscience being focused on abolishing slavery as the greater evil instead of whatever else is going on.
