:END:
If anyone feels generous enough to offer me a fic recommendation or two, I'd really appreciate it! Though I know this is probably an individual-specific post, I hope/imagine there are other readers who have similar taste and would benefit from this post later on - so trying to use as many key words as possible.

Preferences -- not requirements, but just for an idea of what I like:

1. The most important thing for me is good storytelling/writing - I'm willing to try something new out if it's well-written.
2. I enjoy longer fics. I'll read the occasional one-shot, but I'm really looking for a 100k word+ type of deal.
3. I typically enjoy fics that center around Harry, and occur roughly during his Hogwarts years.
4. I have most enjoyed fics that are Adventure/Mystery with minimal or delayed/subtle romance. I don't like crackfics.
5. I don't like weird pairings - Harry / Lord Voldemort, Snape / Hermione, etc. though willing to read past them if the rest of the story is worth it.
6. I don't like character bashing. I'll deal with it, but I prefer that those who think Ron or Dumbledore or whoever suck just change them/make them act OOC so that there aren't any obviously super dumb/super manipulative for no reason characters.
7. I really like fics where Snape or Dumbledore step into a mentor-role for Harry/the main character.
8. I like smart!Harry, Slytherin!Harry, etc. but not Godlike!Harry or fics that have describe his intense physical training regimen that he starts aged 11, or that overly focus on him racking up titles, being a goblin-whisperer, etc. at the expense of plot.
9. I just finished /Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin/ (or what's written of it) and really really enjoyed it. I've also liked some popular time travel fics, the WBWL fic with Harry and Connor Potter, and a Severitus or two.

Thanks!!

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

*** I've read a few chapters of 'A Little Child Will Lead Them', didn't really enjoy it - everyone's response to Hermione seemed unrealistic, but maybe that's bc it's a very random scenario. It just felt a little pointless re: plot. I just read Playmate - it was indeed depressing, but it was fine I suppose. It's not totally my style. I'm enjoying Petrification Proliferation though! Thanks!

**** Those fics cover widely different genres. Little Child is a good example of a straight fix it fic, more of a feel good than a drama.

Some of my other recs (hourglass, red Knight) have the element of redo but things don't go so perfectly.

I know there are a few deconstructed fix it fics out there, but I don't know any stellar ones.
