They're my guilty pleasure and I really need some positivity right now.


** Well, I haven't really read much next-gen but linkffn(The Secret Diary of Hugo Granger-Weasley, Aged Thirteen and a Half; Scorpius Malfoy and the Improbable Plot) were quite good.

Apart from those, while it's not next-gen I highly recommend the linkffn(Where in the world is Harry Potter) series, always my go to for some lighthearted, funny fics.

  Rose says that I am an oblivious moron, but would an oblivious moron have such a deep and sensitive diary? I don't think so. No one knows how I suffer in this ridiculous family. Written for SIYE's The Burrow Secret Challenge 2016, and inspired by Sue Townsend's Adrian Mole.

  Scorpius really should have listened to his father's numerous and dire warnings about the Potter clan. Harry feels his pain. Gen crackfic WIP, yo. Seriously, so cracky.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

** linkao3(Put your guns away, it's tea time)

The first fic in the series is definitely positive. The second one less so, but still ends on a good note. The third one is ongoing (possibly abandoned?) and has a lot of funny moments, but does have an "enemy organization" that the characters work against, which may turn you off the fic if you're not looking for plot.

  Ginny Potter estimates it will only take three days into the Weasley-Potter family holiday for Albus to act on his feelings for his best friend. Albus estimates it will only take three days for him to die of embarrassment. And Scorpius, well. Scorpius is just glad to be there with Albus in the first place.

** This is slash and cross-gen so possibly not your cup of tea, but it's sweet-natured and gently humorous.
