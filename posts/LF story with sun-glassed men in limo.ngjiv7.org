Here is what I recall: Harry is picked up by a group of {sunglass wearing?) men (who actually work for his family) in a limo. They take him to a hotel that he owns and disclose that he's (one of?) the richest person in the world. The fact that he has green eyes is part of this, and the inheritance is through his mother. I really thought the family was Draven, but I'm not sure about that. I don't remember the completion status. Thanks!


** I seem to remember this story myself, but a quick google is not bringing up anything that screams that it's the right story.\\
If it's the story I'm thinking of, then it's a sort of crime syndicate, that is the Evans family legacy.

I did manage to find this, which sounds like a bit of an overlap in that theme, but I would need to start reading to see if it matched.\\

*** It does include this line in the first chapter, which I definitely remember seeing before.

"What magic?" asked Harry calmly. "How can I explain what type of magic I used, when you don't want me to use the magic. I would have to pull some magical solution out to my hat, to explain magic without uttering the word magic!"

** That IS a good one!

I the one I'm recalling, I think he leaves Gringott's to stay in the muggle world and gets picked up. I think it's night, and the men are wearing sun glasses. They know about magic. All the direct line of this family have green eyes. They take him to a fabulous hotel, and put him in the owners suite, because he is the owner.

I think his mom was out with the Evans to protect her.

The family is super wealthy in both the muggle and magical world.
