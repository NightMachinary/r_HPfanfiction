** I'm thinking maybe a crack fic along the lines of this:

During Harry's first year Voldemort successfully obtains the philosopher's stone and immediately uses it to create a new body. He then kills Dumbledore using his death to create Nagini, apparates into the Great Hall and summons his Death Eaters to celebrate his return.

However what he doesn't realize is that drinking the elixir also created bodies for all of his other Horcruxes.

Right in the middle of his victory speech Voldemort is interrupted by Diadem!Voldemort who comes down from the Room of Requirement, declares the real Voldemort to be an imposter and demands for him to surrender himself. Things quickly deteriorate and they start throwing curses at each other.

In the middle of their epic duel, Nagini comes to the conclusion that she also is the real Lord Voldemort and begins attacking the other two. Surprisingly a large number of Death Eaters (led by Crabbe and Goyle) believe that Nagini must be the real one and throw in their lot with her despite the fact that she is still quite obviously just a snake.

Meanwhile Cup!Voldemort declares Gringotts as his new fortress of darkness and raises an army of imperiused goblins against Hogwarts.

Ring!Voldemort and Locket!Voldemort both realize that their other brethren got a big head start on them and enter a strategic alliance to stand a chance. Their alliance is however greatly marred by the fact that they can never agree over who of them gets to be in charge even though their personalities are virtually identical and they don't disagree on a single actual issue.

While all the other Horcruxes are fighting each other Diary!Riddle gets completely disillusioned at himself over how unhinged all his older selves have become and falls into a deep personal crisis, eventually defecting to the Order of the Phoenix.

Finally, once all the different Voldemorts have been taken care of Harry reveals that he was also a Horcrux all along, and was just biding his time waiting for the others to off each other, before taking over the Ministry of Magic.

However, it quickly becomes clear that since the Horcrux merged with Harry's original soul he/it is now really bad at actually doing anything evil, so no one really minds (much.)

**** Unfortunately probably not ever. I have a pretty horrible track record when it comes to putting my story ideas on paper.

I am also currently programming a computer game with a friend which is eating up pretty much all the free time I might spend on writing something like this.

Who knows, maybe someone else will pick the idea up or write something similar, or perhaps at some point I will find the time, motivation, and skill to write this, but currently I'm not too optimistic.

Sorry.

***** I'm honestly content with the summary. It might be a little rushed, but, well, it's a story with plot and characterisation and whatnot. I was very thoroughly entertained and very nearly laughed myself sick at Ring and Locket.

I think I will riff off the idea, but that means a story /may/ turn up online in five to ten years, and it won't be that exact plot. Just, I had loads of fun reading that, thank you.

***** On the bright side, that's a pretty clear outline you've just posted so if anyone were to feel up to the task of writing it, the only "issues" as such would be having the drive to actually finish the thing as opposed to running out of plot ideas, and finding the words to fill in the scenes between each major plot point.

Definitely a lot of humorous character interactions to be had here, I think.

  We bowed, raised our wands, and began. "Avada Kedavra!"

  The following fight can best be described as very green. Avada Kedavras flew wildly through the air. His were weaker than mine as he was still cheerful after gaining a new body while I was carrying a grudge over his sabotaging my time in the tournament.

** Pal, I've been waiting forever for this. Everyone wants to write it, no one has the guts, because it would need an epic scope to be done justice. Closest is White Squirrel's abandoned /Brothers Gaunt/, or (brrr) Robst's /Souls Abound/, which is obviously terrible.

In my own story, I've had various Voldemorts incarnate (or close enough), but not yet all of them, and they're working /together/, regardless.

** I think I began (but never finished) reading a fic where all Horcruxes had found a body (by possession maybe) and were in the graveyard of Little Hangleton. I don't think they were really happy to be together and all had trait from the person they had possessed. It's highly possible it was a crack fic but as I didn't finish it I don't remember much more or the title.
