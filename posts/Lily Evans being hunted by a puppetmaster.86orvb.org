There was a someone that was obsessed with Lily and made a puppet based on her appearance. There is also a really creepy poem about him controlling her actions.


** Sorry I can't help you, but that gave a little plot bunny: Lily leaves behind a puppet that looks like her to take care of Harry. Obviously the puppet is not Lily, or even human, so it's doesn't act perfect. Sounds like it could be an interesting story about the nature of love and what it means to be human. Again, sorry I don't know which story you're looking for.
