Multiple authors, multiple fics, and it ALWAYS bothers me... /WHY/ is it that TRAIL and TRIAL are impossible for people to use correctly? I've seen the mix up run in both directions, something /trialing/ along behind something, and a /trail/ before the wizengamot. </rant>

Whats the weirdest typo that you notice most consistently?


** Breath when the author meant breathe is what I see most often followed very closely by wonder for wander.

In fact the fic I'm reading right now has the line 'Harry decided he would wonder around Diagon Alley.'

*** What bugs me the most about this is that it's the autocorrect's fault- people misspell it 'definately' or 'definatly' and despite the law of averages as to which was intended, the little fixit wizard assumes that there was a swapped pair of letters (>defiantly) rather than the wrong letter chosen (>definitely).

Of course, the whole thing would disappear if people remembered to spell it correctly in the first place.
