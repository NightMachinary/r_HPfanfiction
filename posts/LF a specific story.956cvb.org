It was a Harry and Draco pairing and Evil (?) Hermione. I think Harry found out he was the son of Voldemort and started going under a different name, Serpens maybe? Dumbledore was burned at the stake, Hermione lost her magic but attempted a ritual to bring Sirius back that ended up bringing Sirius back but also James and Lily. It was a three part story. Thank you!
