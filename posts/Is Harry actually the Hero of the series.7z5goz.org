** I believe that was what Rowling tried to do in writing the series; to show that heroes are not solo crusaders, but require a lot of support and trust from friends and family.

Harry was merely thrust into the center of a large machine without wanting to, and to his credit, he took it up. The effort to defeat Voldemort was massive and cumulative, and we just happen to sit on Harry's shoulders and see through his eyes for the ride.

So Harry is indeed a hero of the series, but not /the/ hero of the series. At least that's how I see it.

** well you just figured out why the indie!Harry genre exists. Fixing the "passivity" of Harry is a pretty common trope.

Though I agree that Harry is being let around the nose a bit too much, that doesn't diminish his heroic-ness (?) in any way. When it comes down to it he's still the guy who throws himself on a troll or goes alone in the forest to confront Voldemort. There's no doubt that he has what typically would be required of a "Hero".

I think the word you're looking for is "heroism." :D

I like that Harry isn't the sole hero of the series. Far too many franchises have just the main hero accomplish everything, and often go through all the important tribulations completely alone, reducing everyone else to a glorified cameo. That's not a problem with HP, where it's actually clear that while Harry is a very important person both in the plot an in the wizarding world... the world doesn't actually revolve around him.

Derp. Thanks. My brain went on a vacation there.

That's okay. I agree in the broadest terms to what you say in this paragraph. But... Harry is the sole protagonist in the series. If Dumbledore or maybe Hermione were PoV characters your argument would have more merit. Often we as the readers are - just the same as Harry - confronted with a "this is how it's going to be" kind of pre-made decision. It doesn't work very well, when the readers identify with the protagonists and constantly second guess the main character: "Why doesn't he just do x?!".

***** Harry is the protagonist, yes, but not the sole hero. The two things aren't necessarily the same. ;)

** Pretty pathetic is very harsh. And Harry himself has already said this: 5th book in the Hog's Head. Hermione told us in the first book that being a great wizard is more than magic, it's about friendship and bravery. Harry's walk to the forest is probably the most heroic moment in the books.
