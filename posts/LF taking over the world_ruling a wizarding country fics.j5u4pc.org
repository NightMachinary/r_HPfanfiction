Anything where someone actually successfully takes over a significant part of the wizarding world and has to deal with international politics and other challenges of actually ruling a country such as keeping the economy from collapsing, keeping the population in line with propaganda, and more.

A significant challenge in any wizarding dictators plans could be that people generally don't like to live in a dictatorship, and unlike what East Germany did and North Korea still does you can't easily stop wizards from leaving the country.


** This is the longest fanfic I've ever read, but I absolutely have to recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom.]] Phenomenal work and a deep look into how Voldemort gaining control of the UK during the first war might've played out.
