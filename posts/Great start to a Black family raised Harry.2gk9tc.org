** How exactly is it a great start? I do admit that seeing the rest of the black family alive at the end of the war and adopting harry is an interesting turn, but please don't just post a link? Tell us why its great! :D

** While I agree the story is worth recommending, you may wish to link to chapter 1 instead of 14 to avoid reader confusion.

** Thanks! This is interesting indeed. The actually test would be how the author would handle once Harry reaches hogwarts. Anyway, are there any other fics where Harry was raised by Blacks or other purebloods apart from Malfoys? I read growing up black and also the one where harry's named orion black

** Would someone please explain what makes the story good? I've tried the first two chapter, but with everyone snarling and smirking, I couldn't continue on. So, what makes this one good?
