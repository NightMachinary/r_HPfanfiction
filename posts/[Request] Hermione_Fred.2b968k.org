** I can't link anything right now but look up the user wizard's pupil on fanfiction.net. She writes the BEST fred/hermione and george/hermione fics

Edit: I fully recommend Forbidden Bond and it's sequel Legends, Tale as Old as Time, Snipe and the Hermione/ George fics Marriage Mischief, Yule, and I Must Not Cause Trouble. All are over 40 chapters practically and I think only one of them is a marriage law one. She's an amazing writer
