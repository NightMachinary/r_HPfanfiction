What story do you want to read?

What plot bunny do you wish was turned into a full fledged story?

What challenge do you want to be picked up?

What oneshot do you /need/ to be expanded on?

Hopefully we can share some ideas and maybe inspire some original stories. If anyone does write any ideas please let us know.

I've posted something similar a few times, if you're interested in having a look at previous responses [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6op1jz/what_story_do_you_want_to_read_that_hasnt_been/][here]] is a link.

I think part of the problem is that some of the tropes are so different from canon. Friendly!goblins wouldn't make sense in canon, for example, because no one in canon would expect goblins to be friendly, including Harry. Everyone knows you can't just swear on your magic and have it be true, etc.

Harry ends up sorted into Slytherin... The troll scenario doesn't happen as Ron isn't friends with Harry. People think he is really strange because he knows everything and is wayyy to good at magic at his age.

Ginny doesn't get the diary, Lucius holds his card closer to his chest as things have changed. Harry tries to get Pettigrew early but fails due to lack of access to Ron and he disappears early, leading to scabbers not being in the photo. Sirius doesn't escape and no one believes Harry's story.

And things just get worse from there. Don't forget this is Canon Harry so it's not like he can break into Azkaban or anything on his own.

The biggest problem with this idea is Dumbledore. He would need to be removed from the equation early as he is too powerful.

** A dark Hufflepuff story.

Everyone characterises them as useless, but imagine you're an aspiring Dark Lord, and you have to pick two traits for your followers. Do you want them to be cunning? Ambitious? Brave? Chivalrous? Witty? Academic? Or do you want them to be hardworking and loyal?

Not necessarily on Voldemort's team, but a bunch of Hufflepuff loyal to each other and taking this loyalty way too far, with the work ethic to make it happen. It starts off nice and innocent in first year but gradually gets more insidious until by the time you get to the height of the war in sixth / seventh year you really don't know who the good guys are.

** A dimensional traveling Lily helping out Harry, instead of the other way around. This Lily had already beaten Voldemort at a much earlier stage than in canon, but lost everyone she cared in the process, including James, Harry, Sirius, and Remus. With Voldemort gone, she lost her drive and fell into a deep depression. As a consequence, she attempted a ritual that would bring her to a place where her Harry was still live. After several years of effort, she managed to arrive in the canon world sometime during Year 5.

This Lily was very powerful, less than Voldemort, but significantly stronger than Bellatrix. She wasn't totally sane either. This story will be very much about her finding herself again as beating Voldemort again. In fact, Voldemort would be hardly a great challenge.

*** Combination of a number of different plot bunnies into a single AU world:

We start off with elements from Lords of Magic, with alterations:

- Certain very rare wizards are born with magic which is qualitatively different from other wizards, making them significantly more magical beings. This does not just mean that their spells are stronger, it means that they have a greater connection to magic more generally e.g. superior magical instincts and senses. These wizards are known as the Alchemists.

- Alchemists have the power to perform true human transfiguration, not just of the body but also of the soul. This means they can use transfiguration to de-age your body and your soul won't remember your true age. By this means, alchemists are able to give themselves and anyone they choose immortal life (or at least, eternal youth).

- The wizarding population is significantly larger than in canon due to many wizards never dying (due to being deaged by the Alchemists).

- Due to the combination of the above factors, the politics of wizarding society is dominated by the rare Alchemists who are the source of immortality. Many of them are famous historical wizards from canon. Each alchemist has their own court - the set of families loyal to them, for whom they provide immortality in return for service in a feudal type relationship.

Now we veer off into new territory:

- The International Statute of Secrecy was never passed.

- All over the world, wizards actively and openly interfere in Muggle government (or rather, since there is no separation, simply THE government). In Britain this occurs to the extent that the political class is almost entirely the same as the magical elite. There are very few Muggles who occupy the top level of society. The wizarding elite rule the Muggle world directly, both politically and financially.

- Despite this, wizarding inequality remains - there are still poor wizards, though they're doing better than poor Muggles.

- The British Empire remains in full swing.

- Honour duels are still permitted.

- Technology has taken a different direction to the real world. The most notable absences are the lack of widespread electrification and the lack of development of rocketry (also no nuclear weapons). The industrial revolution still took place (with a magical twist) and there is a generally steampunky feel to technology. But it's not all bad news for Muggles: the proliferation of magical items for Muggle use has resulted in some novel technologies the modern Muggle world lacks, especially in the areas of medicine, transportation, and "magical AI".

- AIR SHIPS.

- As the wizarding elite became more and more embedded in the rule of the Muggle world, so too did they become more and more wedded to physical locations, and in particular London. As such, wizarding power and wealth have concentrated in London, and along with it so too has demand for local magical services.

- Over the years, magical theory becomes ever more complex as further advances are made. On top of this, new areas of magical study are developing relating to the use of magic in ways that did not occur in canon e.g. magical engineering, magic on the mass scale. These factors have resulted in a growing demand for magical tertiary education.

- The combination of the above two factors resulted, in the mid 1800s, in the founding of the Westminster College of the Magical Arts. It serves largely the children of the magical elite i.e. Hogwarts students.

- The Potter family are not part of the magical elite, but are rather solidly magical middle class (which still corresponds to a pretty high level of privilege, but which still means a large gulf separates them from the empire-spanning titans of commerce who occupy the top levels of society).

- Tom Riddle is a young Alchemist who promotes that wizards return to the "old ways" where they are less focused on industry and material wealth and more focused on individual magical achievement. He bemoans the impact the Muggle world has had on wizarding life and feels like wizards have lost their way, steadily making themselves more and more like Muggles and losing touch with their magic. He wishes to enact a separation between wizards and Muggles where wizards create their own society based entirely around magic and they leave the Muggles to their squalor and dirt. He promotes this cause through political means but of course uses plenty of underhand, illegal and immoral tactics. Many of the wizarding young and poor - those who are disadvantaged by the structure of wizarding society - flock to his cause. No "Voldemort", no civil war (except in the form of murders and disappearances).

- James Potter foolishly challenged Tom Riddle to an honour duel and was killed in that duel. Harry and his younger sister are raised by Lily.

- Harry does not attend Hogwarts, which is beyond his family's means, but he attends a decent school and achieves excellent grades, considered by all his teachers to be a magical talent. He is therefore able to secure a place at Westminster College, where he will rub shoulders with the magical elite.

- The story opens as Harry, age 18 and already accomplished in the magical arts, starts at Westminster College.

The focus of the story is largely political/social/relationship based, tracking:

- Harry's friendships and relationships at college, including a romance with Daphne Greengrass, someone who is socially completely out of his league.

- How he goes from being an outsider to beginning to break into the social circles of the magical elite.

- How he begins to attract the attention of both Tom Riddle and Albus Dumbledore due to his rapidly growing magical talents.

- The mystery of what led James Potter to challenge Tom Riddle to a duel, and Harry's potentially misguided desire for revenge.

** Realistic and well written "Voldemort wins" fics.

I want to see Harry grow up in this world and try and figure out who he is and deal with his disagreement of the current regime. My attempts to write this do not satisfy the well written criteria :)

I've not come across any, so if you have them send them my way.

I'll post my plot bunny below, or at least how I envision it so far:

I tried to make this a one shot but it just kept getting fleshed out so I sort of ran with it.

Second Choice

Brief Summary: AU: Voldemort wins, Harry is not the child of prophecy and his parents are killed in the war. He is raised by Regulus as his brother's dying wish. Hogwarts only takes those of pureblood from good families, the rest are sent to trade schools. Ginny Weasley manages to get into Hogwarts due to something something power level something haven't figured out. While at Hogwarts Harry/Ginny become close, even though Harry knows she is below his station. Lots of stuff happens and bam its 4th year. Harry takes Daphne to the ball as the Greengrasses have been courting him, as the Potter name is old, even if disgraced slightly by James's treason. Daphne and Harry don't really like each other, but Daphne goes along with it as it is her family's wishes and Harry does as he is already in a precarious position (Voldemort won't forget the son of one of his enemies); this marriage would be a chance to cement his good standing.

So basically what I want to happen is Harry has to choose between Ginny who he loves, or Daphne who would grant him political immunity, wealth, and status. I plan on having three endings.

One with Ginny: In short they have a loving relationship until Voldemort kills him.

One with Daphne: He is miserable and lonely trapped in a loveless relationship.

The last where Harry unleashes Fiendfyre in the Wizengamot killing himself but taking the government with him.

My goal is to not only write a decent romance, but have the reader really think about the choices that are presented to them. Which ending would you choose would be what I want them to walk away from the story asking themselves.

*** I love stories like this. I cannot for the life of me remember one fic I read a while back where Voldemort won and Harry still had his parents, but the whole death thing was done differently...like Harry could die and come back to life again. Dumbledore was already dead, he ends up going to Durmstrang, the war continues and his parents have to fight for Voldemort as he attempts to take over neighboring wizarding nations as well. In the latest chapters, the Triwizard Championship became a thing again, expect way more horrific because its Voldemort, Bellatrix, and Sirius who are running it.

  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

Like, the Wizarding world would still be super fucked up even without the Death Eaters. A couple of authors have done something similar, but it's more like generic store-brand revolutionaries who then just end up implementing reforms anyway instead of a complete upheaval of the system, which is what Britain would need.

** Unable to bear the pain after Lilly finally chose and marrried James Potter, Snape decides to submit to tradition and joins the Magical French Legion.\\
As a result, Voldemort never hears of the prophecy.\\
Pettigrew still betrays his friends. He kiils Remus to stop his negociations with the werewolves and frames Sirius (as usual). He later kills James as well for whatever reason linked to his job as an Auror, grows closer to Lilly and some kind of an uncle/substitute father to Harry. He tries to subtly sway him to the Dark, Harry grows unstable as a result, he has conflicting views.\\
Harry grows up surrounded by a loving mother and some of his fathers friends (The Tonks, whom he knew from Sirius, Flitwick, who shares the role of father figure to Harry with Peter and maybe the few Bones still alive, met through James's job), Tonks becomes Harry's cool big sis. Harry will also make friends with a random Slytherin (say Theodore Nott) who wishes to distanciate himself from his death eater familly, as Sirius did years prior.\\
Neville is an arrogant pure blood who will need to learn humility.\\
Nobody's able to tell exactly who the boy from the prophecy is. Dumbledore suspects it's Harry or Neville but keeps his distances to avoid attracting Voldemort's attention.\\
Voldemort is killed at some point (non-permanently of course).\\
Harry and Hermione become almost immediately academic rivals, Neville is friend with Ron.\\
Luna's mother never has her accident (or survives it) but Xenophilius is killed by Bellatrix after opposing Voldemort in a Quibbler's article. As a result, Luna's quirkyness manifests differently.

When Harry first comes to Hogwarts, Slughorn is the Potions Professor and Aberfoth Dumbledore has accepted the position of History Professor.\\
During Harry's 3rd year, two major events happen. Snape, his contract with the Legion finally over, takes the position of Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor, and Sirius manages to flee from Azkaban with the help of his great aunt Cassiopeia, one of the last Black alive.

It's a bit bare bones and certainly needs a lot of work but I think you get the idea.

- A fic inspired by Twin Peaks - or even a direct crossover - where someone in Hogwarts is possessed by BOB - and instead of dying at the hands of Voldemort and going to meet Dumbledore, Harry finds himself in the Red Room.
- A standard prison breakout fic, where Hogwarts is turned into a prison following Voldemort's victory, and the main characters have to escape and get out of Britain/defeat Voldemort in order to survive.
- A Wrong Boy Who Lived fic with a similar style of humour Monty Python's Life of Brian. ("He's not the Boy Who Lived, he's a very naughty boy!") I suck at writing comedy, otherwise I would have written this by now.

** - Snape decides that while still in school that joining the DEaters isn't worth it/something poisons that relationship, but he doesn't care to join the (in his opinion) holier-than-thou Order (and it's many members who see Slytherins as evil), so he fucks off to the continent. A few years later, the Order reaches out to a curse-breaking group for help hunting horcruxes, and thus Severus Snape ends up getting dragged back into things regardless.

#+begin_quote
  Snape is a caustic, sarcastic ass, but he's grown up and mellowed some, nor having to deal with the stress of being a double/triple agent or forced to teach. Nevertheless, tempers to flare between him and the Marauders when forced to meet after so many years.
#+end_quote

- Someone stumbles into a horcrux and accidentally is life-sucked, giving life to the shade inside, as Diary!Tom nearly did in Chamber of Secrets, adding another faction to the war (as god knows the Voldemorts wouldn't cooperate). If possible, add even more reasonably-possible factions or groups; the fact there aren't fics with more partisan or militant groups fighting the big factions (or each other) than the Order is kind of sad.

#+begin_quote
  Tentative factions: Ministry, Order of Phoenix, Death Eaters & Voldemort Prime, Horcrux-mort (who's possibly unhinged and messing with really Bad things like large-scale Necromancy or demon-summoning), muggleborn resistance group, ultraconservative pureblood movement that hates DEaters for conflicts in ideology or methods, and more.

  That could've been such a beautiful mess, and hopefully someone someday makes it.

When Draco asks if anyone knows what happened mockingly, Harry says he does, then recites what he remembered (from parents realizing their guest to the final curse). Cue horrified silence from all listeners as it sinks in he remembered such a horrific event.

  Probably just a oneshot, but could've been interesting.

- After Harry is called to the Headmaster's office after defending himself against Draco, a sneered derision by Snape is met by Harry finally responding, calmly ripping the man down by saying that his mom chose James over him because at least his father grew up, whereas Snape was fine belittling the son of his rival, the son who never even dealt with the father beyond infanthood. Cue Snape's meltdown.

** I would like to read stories where:

Snape actively tries to murder each of the DADA professors each year.

Voldemort taking a political angle so that we effectively get Harry Potter/House of Cards during the 1970s and 1980s instead of the war. Bonus points if we have a dimension-travelling Harry who realises what's happening, but has totally the wrong set of skills to stop it happening and thereby ends up effectively aiding Voldemort by giving him a terrorist enemy as a target.

A quick story set in a universe where Harry goes back for seventh year and is perpetually convinced the (completely innocent) defence teacher wants to murder him.

The complete works of Gilderoy Lockhart, possibly written in the style of the Flashman Papers. Extra points if we get accounts of the adventures Gilderoy actually went through to claim victories and he only gets by on charm, obliviation and a surprisingly quick wit.

I would love a James Bond/Johnny English style adventure starring a reluctant Theodore Nott.

*** Make it a Snape-and-Neville /Breaking Bad/ instead. Snape has the necessary skill in potions to be able to brew drugs, and even though he considered Neville to be one of his most inept students, he is well aware that Neville possesses the knowledge of herbology which he requires. Since Neville knows where to go to get Snape's raw materials, and Snape can make the potions that Neville can't, they form a partnership of convenience - but one which is made tense due to mutual loathing. It's the perfect mirror of Walter and Jesse's relationship.

** Voldemort and harry are both immortal cause of the prophecy and end up over a thousand years old fighting for the final time in the middle of a world that has been completely destroyed by their war and they are the only ones left alive. Harry beats Moldyshorts and decides that he wants to set things right, he goes back in time to just before the first war and tries to stop voldy from ever becoming a threat but magic karma fucks him over with the whole "terrible things happen to wizards who meddle with time" stuff and he ends up both severely and permanently weakened by the effort of time travel, and ends up in a past where everything is just slightly different enough that it isn't an easy task for centuries old harry. Bit like Delenda Est but with harry being prepared for time travel. It has to have a scene where the order is interrogating him on how bad it got, they ask him to describe it and he says he'll demonstrate the casualties and then he points himself and says that out of everyone in the room (there has to be young people there too) only he survived.

I think it would be straight up awesome to see Harry with the skill and knowledge to outmatch Dumbledore, even if he lost the power to do so.
