I am trying to get some fanfic on calibre, and fanficfare plugin doesn't work anymore. I have also tried ficsave(doesn't work), and linkffn to download as epub. Is there any other way to get them on calibre?


** Have you done the update for fanficfare? Also which version Calibre are you running? Fanfiction.net has recently changed something with the cloudfarefrontend afaik and the fanficfare plugin has been updated to keep working. The newer plugin needs 5.x to work reliably

*** What's wrong with FanFicFare that FanFicDownloader improves? I use the former regularly, but I am open to changing to something better.

**** Well it's super easy to use! :) It has a super small window and it auto pastes story links so you just gotta click one button and it's done! You get a Ebook. :)
