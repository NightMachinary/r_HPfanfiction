I want a fic where he gets carted off to Azkaban, but with the twist that he actually does commit a crime worthy of it. Like, make the story about how the Ministry still need his help dealing with Voldemort, and so they're forced to reluctantly recruit an actual criminal.

I always see fics about Harry being innocent, and his friends easily believing in his guilt for some reason. But what if he actually does something horrible, and his friends refuse to believe in anything but his innocence?

What if instead of Dumbledore being manipulative and throwing Harry to the wolves, he actually, truly tries to redeem him?

There are so many directions it can take...does anyone know of any fics that do this?


** linkffn(The Double Agent) somewhat meets your criteria.

*** This fic was beautiful. The parallels with Itachi (from Naruto) were sad.

  A Harry Potter Oneshot. Follow Harry's journey through the shadows of the war with Lord Voldemort, and watch as he does everything necessary to ensure the survival of his family. Non-BWL Harry! BigBrotherHarry! Rated M to be safe.

  I'm sick of the manipulation, the lies and the deceit; sick of jumping to the tune of dark lords and old puppeteers. I'm cutting the strings. Innocents will pay in blood for my defiance, but I no longer care. I lost my innocence long ago. Dark!Harry

** He deserved to be in prison in linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7309863/1/The-Prisoner-s-Cipher]]) but everyone understands the situation and he breaks out, no ministry trying to use him on Voldemort.

  AU. Years after his defeat of Voldemort, Harry Potter remains a willing and secret prisoner of the Ministry, but not all is what it seems. Harry has a plan, and the world will never be the same.

** Not the full extent of your request, but my old favorite of Azkaban yarns, linkffn(Dementors by Myranya), does have everyone at Hogwarts /not/ turning on Hermione when she's sent to Azkaban, /and/ her being sent to Azkaban because she actually used an Unforgivable on another wizard (though the wizard in question was a Death Eater and the story treats it as a "end justifies the means" situation).

  Hermione is sent to Azkaban for using the Killing Curse. Can she survive the Dementors?
