** Not actually a "Dudley is a wizard" fic, but still one I have to recommend every time Dudley fics come up

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4172226/1/A-Hero][/A Hero/ by Celebony]]

I'm sorry I can't offer a proper recommendation. I haven't read too many fics where Dudley's a major character, let alone a wizard.

*** Yeah, that's my struggle. He seems like he has a lot of potential as a character. It seems like there's a good man in him at his core, but it's unfortunately buried deep by his abysmal parents. Getting him to Hogwarts and away from his parents is a great way to dig that out.

It happens that I've read that fic before, but thanks for chiming in! I hope others reading this thread might discover it.

  Petunia Dursley has trouble: she's lost her family, she's going crazy, she can do magic (but not always), her suitors are a mixed bag (operative word) & people keep trying to take her children away from her. They should be very afraid. (Not only a) Double Severitus. WARNING: Not what you expected.

#+begin_quote
  Vernon's reaction to having Harry dumped on the doorstep by *their kind* is predictable, and Petunia has a small epiphany over what might happen if Dudley develops magic when he is older the way Lily did. Suddenly her love for her sister is more important than her jealousy, and she takes steps to save Harry and Dudley by contacting the only person she knows in the wizarding world.

  Severus remembered dying---that last hopeless look into Lily green eyes. Now he's back in the past, inexplicably in the infant body of Harry Potter. Oh, and there's something wrong with Dudley. Weirdness ensues. A different time travel fix-it. Likely the oddest Severitus you'll ever read. Inspired by Path of Decision---I See the Moon---Athey's Rebirth. Betad by Eider Down. Complete.

  Dudley Dursley, 37, has only just put his daughter on the Hogwarts Express and said goodbye when Platform 9 3/4 is attacked. In the ensuing explosion, he blacks out - and wakes up as an eleven year old back in Privet Drive. Confused and wary, he finds himself blundering through his life all over again, and unfortunately, being eleven isn't the only surprise in store.
