I really enjoyed the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/55f2su/write_a_short_sceneless_than_1k_wordsfor_a_story/][previous thread]] that [[/u/viol8r]] started, and given that this is the HP fanfiction subbreddit, it's as relevant as can be, so maybe it should be a monthly or quarterly thing to keep the collective muses buzzing... or something.


** Harry walked down the stairs from the bank. He was still angry about everything the goblins had explained to him about how his life had been a lie. They had broken the many obliviate spells that had been cast on him. He learned how Dumbledore violated the wishes of his parents, discarded their will, and placed him with the Dursleys. How Dumbledore knew about the years of abuse at the hands of them. How the people he looked up to purposely hid information from him or outright lied to him. How he had been manipulated his whole life. Teachers and neighbors having their minds tampered with stop from seeing the on going abuse.

It upset him that Dumbledore and Molly has stolen from his vaults. That money that Dumbledore didn't keep for himself had gone to all the Weasley family, including Ron his best mate, Ginny, the twins, and Percy. How even Hermione had been given money out of his vault with full knowledge of where it came from to keep tabs on him and report to Dumbledore.

How he had suffered from malnutrition, poorly healed broken bones, and blocks on his magic. Thankfully the goblins said they could repair most of the damage in the coming weeks.

But now he knew the truth. He was Lord Potter Black Peverell Gryffindor Slytherin. Things would be different. He smiled because he had a plan. And they would pay for their betrayal. For first step of the plan he would get a multi compartment trunk so he had a place to put all the purchases and items from of his vaults he wanted.

Harry entered the trunk store and started browsing the trunks. To his eyes, while some looked to have been made of higher quality materials, the trunks mostly looked all the same. He turned as a middle aged wizard came out of the back.

"Good afternoon welcome to Grantham's Trunks. How can I help you sir?"

I would like to buy one of your best multi compartment trunks" Harry replied.

"Those can be quite expensive" said the clerk as he glanced up at Harry's scar.

"Cost won't be a problem".

"Very well then. Let me tell you about expanded trunks before we get down into the details. There is a maximum how much I can expand the inside of the trunks and still keep them stable. It would be very unpleasant to be inside a trunk with all your furniture then the expansion fails and everything including you is compressed back to a normal trunk size.

Harry gulped at that news.

"So all the maximum expanded trunks have the same inside total dimensions. It just varies in number of rooms, size of the rooms and the purpose of the rooms. Lets go in one of my most popular models to give you an idea what you can get.

The clerk then let Harry toward the back of the store where one grey trunk was sitting by itself. "The outside of this trunk is made of ukrainian ironbelly and is almost indestructible".\\
The wizard reached down and opened the trunk and turned to Harry and said "After you sir".

When Harry's head cleared the trunk lid. The wizard slammed the lid down and locked the trunk.

After smiling to himself, he then went to his desk and wrote out a brief letter.

"Gimpy" he yelled.

A house elf wearing a full black leather with a closed zipper for a mouth hole entered the room with a limp.

"Gimpy, take this trunk and letter to the dark lord" said the wizard as he reached over and unzipped the mouth hole.

"yes master" the house elf replied.

" and gimpy, tell the dark lord that there is no food or water in the trunk so he does not need to hurry"

"yes master" said the the house elf has he bowed and disappeared with the trunk and letter.

Foolish kid, climbing into my prison trunk without a care in the world. Well, he will never make that mistake again. He thought to himself as he walked back to the rear of the store and his workshop.

** From my WIP, The Colour of Everything, a Remus Lupin centred fic:

‘Come take a walk with your old man,' he said quietly.

Remus followed him, away from the cheerful crowd, a slight lurch in his stomach. They walked in silence for a little while, along the edge of the mirror-like lake.

‘Congratulations on your interview,' said Lyall mildly.

‘Right... Yeah, thanks.'

‘I think it would suit you very well.'

Remus nodded, but said nothing. An unspoken truth danced tauntingly around the edge of his father's words. It <i>would</i> suit him. If things had been different.

‘And I suppose it will give you great experience...' Remus knew what was coming before Lyall said it. His father always went slightly red when the topic came up. ‘I don't know if you have given any consideration as to where you will... Where you will <i>be</i> next week... As the Hogsmeade house won't be accessible,' he added when Remus said nothing.

‘Do you mean the Shrieking Shack, Dad?' asked Remus, staring pointedly at the ground.

‘Well, if you must call it that, yes.'

‘That's what everyone calls it.'

Lyall gave a heavy sigh, his hands deep in his pockets. ‘Do you have somewhere to go?'

‘Yes.'

‘Where?'

‘Oh, I thought I'd just hang around outside a Muggle primary school.'

‘Remus, please take this seriously,' Lyall said sharply, stopping. He grabbed Remus's arm and tried to turn him to face him, but Remus stubbornly rolled his head away, gazing moodily over the lake. ‘We could ask Professor Dumbledore if you could continue using the house for the summer, but it simply cannot continue when you are no longer a student here.'

‘I know that,' Remus said through gritted teeth.

‘Well where will you go then? Your mother and I have been doing some research-'

‘It's fine, Dad,' he said hotly. ‘I told you, I have somewhere.'

‘Where?'

‘It's... It's really remote, there won't be anyone around-'

‘How do you know you won't stumble across some Muggle campers? Hmm?'

‘That won't happen,' Remus muttered. He avoided his father's gaze. ‘I'll take precautions.'

‘You learnt the Muggle-repelling charms I sent you, then?' When Remus simply gave a short, irritated nod, Lyall sighed again. He didn't seem to be able to look Remus in the eye anymore, staring down at the muddy ground instead. ‘I know you think I'm... Well, I know you don't like discussing this. But I do it because I care.'

‘Right,' said Remus. ‘That's why it couldn't wait til I got home.'

Lyall at least had the decency to look ashamed. ‘It's not that I don't trust you.' He paused, but Remus said nothing. ‘It's that I'm growing concerned that you're forgetting the seriousness of your condition.'

‘How could I? With you reminding me at every opportunity?'

‘Don't think I didn't notice your friend calling you “Moony”,' Lyall said quietly.

Remus simply stared at him, and swallowed slightly. ‘That... That's a nickname for something else-'

‘Remus, don't insult my intelligence. That's not the only thing. Your mother noticed in your last letter you said that you were too tired to see the Quidditch final, but that “of course the others all understood”-'

‘They did, they just thought I'd had a late night...' He faltered as his father raised a doubtful eyebrow. ‘All right. Fine. Yes, they know. They figured it out years ago. But it wasn't as horrible as you said it would be.'

‘Remus-'

‘They didn't shun me, or tell anyone else. They weren't afraid. They- They supported me, Dad. They helped me. As... As best they could.' He wanted to tell him. He wanted to tell him what it was like to see the silhouette of a rat riding a stag, to see a great black dog running alongside him in the mountains around Hogsmeade.

‘Well, that's very admirable, but-'

‘So maybe you've been wrong this whole time,' said Remus coldly. ‘Maybe it won't matter. Maybe I'll get this job and be able to keep it, and live like a normal person. Maybe they wouldn't even mind.'

Lyall gripped Remus's shoulder. ‘I understand you're angry. I understand what you want. But Remus, I don't do this to punish you. I want you to be happy. I don't want to see you miserable.'

‘This makes me miserable,' said Remus shortly. He turned on his heel and stormed off, back to where his friends were continuing to celebrate leaving Hogwarts.

** Harry awoke in the middle of the night from a queer feeling of excitement that had no cause. Unable to fall back asleep, he ventured down a floor to use the loo. On his way out he heard a muted sniffling coming from the room at the end of the hall -- Tonks' room. He drew close so as not to wake others, and whispered through the door, "Hey, Tonks? Alright in there?"

Following a shuffle of cloth, a thump, and a grunt of 'ow', the woman opened the door. She looked exactly as Harry would have predicted; wilted. He just didn't know why.

Tonks murmured, "What're you doin' up?"

"Kreacher patrol," Harry said. "He's getting on in years, so I offered to creep around and mutter at people for him."

Tonks sobbed out a laugh. "You're funny."

"Just a little- I learned from the Weasleys. They're usually the funny ones."

Her face fell at that and she turned away, returning to a tatty old reading chair to resume her wallowing.

Harry followed her in and closed the door. He sat across from her on the ottoman. "Why are you so upset?"

"Oh, it's-- it's my fault!" she blurted. She emphasized her fraying nerves by the way her forearms flew apart once she'd got her fingers untangled. "I swapped duties with Arthur. If it weren't for me he'd be alright."

"And instead, you'd be dying from a snake bite. How is that better?"

She scowled at that. "I can handle meself better than Mr. Weasley, Harry. I woulda given that bloody snake a spell or two."

"Or you wouldn't have, because it caught you by surprise and you'd be in the same boat as Mr. Weasley."

"Arthur was tired, Harry! He'd been running around for his office before he took his shift. I wouldn't have been--"

"Aren't you, like, perpetually twitchy or something? You told me before that stakeouts make you nutty."

"I'd have done PAPERWORK!"

"Oh, and that'd keep you alert, would it?"

They kept up like this for the better part of an hour, Tonks' what-ifs becoming more ridiculous as they went. Finally she conceded. She gave Harry a warm hug for talking her away from her miseries, then kicked him out of her room.

** The below is the prologue for my WIP, a post-DH (AU) murder mystery.

*May 2nd 2004. Morning at St Mungo's.*

Bertram Aubrey, the night orderly in Ward 49 at St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries jolted awake with the realisation he had been asleep and dreaming about the delicious breakfast that awaited him at home when he finished up his shift. Wishing young Healer Pye would get a jolly wriggle on Bert stretched the kinks in his lower back and rubbed gritty eyes with balled up fists.

Bert huffed an irritated sigh as he spotted Augustus Pye hurrying through the door shuffling great sheaves of parchment and nodding apologetically to the clock on the wall. Noting unhappily the cuffs of his shirt were dingy and grey around his knobbly wrists as he grabbed the jangling bunch of old keys from their hook behind his desk, he tugged at his robes trying to hide the fact, not remembering what he might have done to get so grubby.

As they did most mornings, the two men made their way first to the locked section of the ward where the patients who were sometimes a danger to themselves or others resided. Bert unlocked the door and let it swing open as he again tugged the ends of his too short robe down over his grimy cuffs, looking up only at the sound of a startled oath from his companion.

The woman's body hung heavily from the knotted sheet around her neck. The little of her face that was visible to Bert from beneath the dull curtain of dun-coloured hair was mottled and blue. The Mediwizard immediately drew his wand and began uttering diagnostic charms, but as Augustus seized her wrist to check for a pulse, Bert glanced at the dark mark on her forearm, starkly black against her pale flesh and mourned the bacon butty his wife would have waiting.

It was hard to care that there was one less Death Eater left in the world, especially today.

** Coming from [[https://de.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/59he8n/do_you_know_some_bellatrixsirius_because_it_could/][this thread]] I set out to write a Sirius/Bellatrix fic. This is the scene when Bellatrix gets confronted with Sirius' extravagant choice of real estate. If you want to read the full thing (ca. 16k words) here is the [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aX_kHmAIwnRILgViW1BlaOq3Uar1DYrsozg0603SnoY/edit?usp=sharing][link]].

For a little explanation: Bellatrix killed Voldemort in this fic because an unplanned pregnancy with Sirius' child made her rewrite her life plans. She proceeds to milk her kill for all its worth and letting herself be celebrated as the Defeater of Voldemort. The Black family is understandably not amused and they have arranged to meet at the new residence of Bellatrix and Sirius.

--------------

Sirius looked at his watch. It was half past five and Bellatrix was already slightly overdue. It was to be expected, though. Everybody wanted an interview with her, publications wanted photos and there were even some companies who came to her with contracts for marketing and promotion. Sirius smirked. She said she hated it, but he knew how much she loved it. He knew from the way she ranted about those ‘imbecilic pigs' and the way they threw money at her. She has also had those rants about tea parties with her little sister Narcissa, or when she had helped Regulus with his Arithmancy. She smiled way too much during those rants.

Sirius was disturbed in his musing by the distinct sound of apparition, followed by the sweet sound of inbound pain, also known as an irate Bella.

“Why are we in Castle Black, Potter? Wh... What happened here?” he could hear Bellatrix ask.

Sirius quickly walked out into the Entrance Hall, les Bellatrix would start to demand answers from Lily. He may or may not have let Bellatrix in the belief that he planned the meeting with the Black family in his flat in London.

He may or may not die tonight. He looked forward to finding out.

With a huge grin he came through the golden archway and spread his arms. “What do you think?”

“What have you done, Sirius?” she growled. “Why did Potter bring me here?”

“I seized the Castle, of course.” Sirius answered in a conversational tone. “I thought since it is the place where we found together, it may be a great place to settle down. I remember a young little witch dreaming of living on top of the Ben Lomond. This, I figured, is the next best thing.”

“So when I sent you to use the time I was in trials to search for a house we can raise our child in, your idea was Castle Black?”

“Yup.” Sirius said and swept Bellatrix into a hug.

“You're an idiot.” she spat.

But Sirius didn't even react to the insult. All he did was to take her by the waist and by her arm and drag her through the steps of a waltz while singing. “By yon bonnie banks and by yon bonnie braes - Where the sun shines bright on Loch Lomond...”

“Arcturus is gonna murder you.”

“...Where me and my true love spent many happy days...”

“Your mother may actually turn into a banshee.”

“...On the bonnie bonnie banks of Loch Lomond.”

“Sirius!” Bellatrix demanded, but her feet started following his waltz.

“‘Twas there that we parted in yon shady glen...”

“We need to talk about what we're saying.”

“...On the steep steep sides of Ben Lomond...”

“Circe and Morgana...”

“With a broken heart the Highland hills we view and the moon glints out in the gloaming...”

Bellatrix just sighed and softly hummed against Sirius' chest as he kept singing and they kept dancing through the Entrance Hall. “You'll take the high road and I'll take the low road and I'll be in Scotland before you. Where me and my true love will never meet again.”

Sirius stopped dancing and kissed her softly against the forehead. “On the bonnie bonnie banks of Loch Lomond.” he finished.

“You have an awful singing voice.” she said against his chest.

“You're a horrible dancer.” he gave back, but the smiles in both of their voices said more than their words ever could.

“What possessed you to... to steal the Castle?”

“First off, it's a castle. Best house ever. And also, I didn't steal it. It was abandoned and I claimed it.”

“That's not how Arcturus will see it.” She moved away from his chest and looked deep into his eyes. “He will take it as just another slight against the family. You couldn't wait with this until after this meeting?”

“I thought we get it all over and done with. Get on with our lives with or without them. Their choice.”

“Dimwitted Gryffindor.”

“Slimy Slytherin.”

Sirius received a punch in the guts for his troubles, but instead of a groan he cackled in amusement. Bellatrix meanwhile turned around in the Entrance Hall and took in the freshly renovated state of the castle. “‘t will do.” she said.

“So, Sirius, when are you gonna drop the next bomb?” Lily asked from the chimney. Both Blacks looked at her. Sirius had a wide grin on his face which made Bellatrix' eyes go wide with dread.

“Is now good?” Sirius asked.

Lily only shrugged in answer. “Your funeral.”

“Very well,” Sirius turned around to Bellatrix and took her into his arms once again.

“Oh Merlin, what now?” Bellatrix squinted her eyes at the mischievous smile of her cousin.

“You know, since we have such a huge place now I thought we may want to fill it with some life.”

“The point, Sirius, get to it.”

Sirius just smiled and Lily took over for him. “We talked a bit and since Potter Manor is destroyed and Potter Cottage in need of massive repairs. Repairs that would need months because of the curse and Fidelius residue, Sirius had the idea that we could...”

“No,” Bellatrix deadpanned. “Absolutely not. I won't have Potters in my house... castle.”

Lily touched her temples and winced theatrically. “Argh... oh... oh my... I think. I think I just remembered. We never did meet and you really were a Death Eater. Oh good golly me, I have to report this to Mr. Crouch immediately.”

Bellatrix' felt her right eye start to twitch. She has had to deal with the witch for five days now, as according to her witness testimony they were close chums. Lily Potter was smart, devious, cunning and ruthless in her way of using leverage and reputation. Bellatrix turned around and left for the dining hall without a word. Once she was far enough away she screamed “YOU WIN THIS TIME, POTTER!”

Lily just smirked. “You're a dead man.” she told Sirius.

He just shrugged. “I regret nothing.”

“NOT YET!” came a screech from the Hall

** I started something new too. Here it is.

--------------

His nightmares now seemed distant. He used to have them, every day. He remembered waking up in the middle of the night, swearing, despite the cold winter in London. It was baffling.

He almost couldn't believe it at first, his friends had all been through so much. His best friend had been through things way worse than him. And yet, it bothered him more than it bothered anyone else.

It had been more frequent after the war. He remembered nights in the academy, his bunkmates had to shake him awake because the shivering wouldn't stop.

But that was in the past.

Ronald Weasley had not experienced nightmares in a while. It all seemed like a distant memory, perhaps made worse by all the firewhiskey he seemed hell bent on drinking, drinking to forget.

He stared out the window of his apartment. It was still dark but he could make out dim figures, his eyesight had always been brilliant. On missions, they used him as the spotter. That was before he excelled and was given a more leadership oriented role.

He wasn't wearing anything, he was still snug under the covers. He stared at the distant table right beside the door to his room. There it was, a bottle of firewhiskey. He wanted to summon the bottle, but he thought about it.

‘It's a work day' he told himself. ‘You don't want to go to the office, drunk'

He almost sneered. The last time that happened, he had almost been fired. It was a momentary loss of control, a display of anger he had thought was long beyond him. Apparently not.

There were looks of disapproval. His best friend told him repeatedly that he needed to stop drinking. His sister told him that maybe he needed to find a career that he could cope with. His ex girlfriend, the only woman he had ever truly loved had told him to go fuck himself. He was actually rather proud of managing to get Hermione Granger to swear.

His brothers were a bit more ambivalent. Bill was concerned, but knew that his life was his to do with what he pleased. Charlie was never around. Percy was, well, he was still Percy. Fred-

He paused. Fred. What would Fred have thought about all this.

‘A bit too late to think about that, isn't it'

He was bitter. Perhaps he should have hated it all. He should have rued the day he came in contact with Harry Potter. The day that changed everything. And yet, he couldn't help but think that his family would have been in the thick of it anyway. He would he involved, and there was no telling where he would have been today. Then again, perhaps it didn't really matter.

It would be six hours before he could go to work today. He wasn't going to go back to sleep. He was afraid of what he would see. Afraid that he would have to deal with it all over again.

He looked longingly at the bottle. Alcohol had cost him everything. But it had also solved everything.

-x-

“Are you drunk?” His best friend asked him, with a furious expression on his face. The years had been rather kind to Harry Potter. He used to be the kid who looked glum because of all the responsibilities thrown at him. Today, as a man who was twenty eight years old, he had aged rather well. Witch Weekly seemed to think so anyway.

“Ron” he said. He sounded tired. He was adjusting his glasses. “Even for you, this is a bit...” he trailed off. Ron knew what he was going to say. It was nothing he hadn't heard a million times before.

“Do you need to talk? To someone, I mean?” Harry asked him, he was fidgeting. He did that, when he was nervous. Not many people knew that about famous Harry Potter. But he did.

“Talk about what?” He asked Harry. He thought he sounded alright. No one could tell that he was drunk. Maybe he slurred a bit. He was sure no one had picked that up.

“To a mind healer” Harry continued. Ron stared at him incredulously. He was hoping to see a grin, like how his twin brothers used to do to him when they were kids. His stomach jumped as he thought of his dead twin brother again.

“You're serious” Ron said slowly. Harry nodded.

He thought about it. He thought the nightmares were done. He had dealt with them. Sure, he had to resort to the bottle. Even George had told him to consider laying off the drink. Ron remembered the coldness that followed after that, when he reminded George that he was not in the moral position to stop someone from ‘drinking too much' as he had put it.

The fidgeting got worse. “Hermione and I were talking”

Ron snorted. Hermione never resisted in taking every single opportunity and badmouthing him to everyone they knew.

“This is serious Ron” Harry said with a raised voice. “She told me you were sick, she told me that the job was getting to you. She told me that she had begged and begged to you, asked you to quit”

He remembered that. He couldn't ever forget that. That was when they had realised it. Something between them was broken. There was some bad blood now, but Hermione was not a liar, not his Hermione anyway.

There was still anger though. Betrayal. They were supposed to stick together. He remembered after the war, making love to each other in the fields behind the Burrow. Not a care in the world, no fear of death, no shame if someone would see them.

He remembered kissing her neck. He remembered her throaty moan. Their passionate promises to keep arguing but never fight. Their assurances of love toward each other.

It was all so distant now, so tender. The warmth that existed then was replaced slowly by a coldness. A distance that had crept up between them. Before they noticed it, it had engulfed them.

“How is she?” Ron spit out the words, suddenly not happy about anything. “Her and Vicky spit out any babies yet?”

Harry shook his head.

** A small piece from a time-travel fic that hopefully won't butcher Harry's characterization or make Tom too outrageously intelligent, capable, or evil at sixteen. Deals with obsessive friendship bordering on possible romance.

--------------

Harry watched as Tom screwed up his face in disgust as he set his cup down.

"This pumpkin juice is horribly bitter. Stupid house elves."

Harry took a sip from his own cup. "It tastes fine to me."

As he set his cup down, a dark haired Ravenclaw girl that Harry recognized as being in their year timidly made her way over. Tom had already gone back to reading the paper when her quiet voice squeaked, "Tom?"

His eyes never left the paper as he responded, "Yes?"

When the girl didn't say anything further, he looked up, allowing a bit of annoyance in his tone when he spoke, "What do you want?"

"I- uh... Nevermind."

She practically ran away from the table, and instead of returning to her own, she left the Great Hall.

Tom didn't pay the interaction any mind and immediately re-absorbed himself in the newspaper.

Harry, who observed the exchange in silence, glanced at Tom, then the Great Hall entrance, then to the cup with the bitter pumpkin juice.

"Uh, Tom?"

"What, Harry?" His eyes were still glued to the article he was trying to read.

"I think she spiked your pumpkin juice."

This caused the Slytherin to peak over the top of the paper and question, "Spiked my pumpkin juice? Why would she-"

The Slytherin's face went blank, but Harry could see the swirling emotions underneath.

Without a word, Tom jumped from his seat and ran towards the entrance. Harry immediately followed suit, though his movements weren't nearly as graceful.

** This picks up immediately following the epilogue.

--------------

Stray leaves crunched beneath their feet as they made their way back towards the car. Lily sniffled unhappily, clutching her father's hand, and refused to wave goodbye to her cousin as they approached the car. Ginny rolled her eyes in Hermione's direction.

“We'll see you at Mum's for dinner tomorrow?”

Hermione nodded, hugging Ginny first, then Harry. “Yes. I have to work late, but we'll be there.”

“Good, good. See you then!”

Harry clapped Hugo on the shoulder, wincing slightly as Lily slammed shut the car door and slumped grumpily against the window. Ron caught his eye, grinning, and Harry had to stifle a laugh; both were reminded of another young redhead unhappy at being left behind. They shook hands, not trusting themselves enough to even say goodbye without cracking up, and then the Potters took their leave, merging carefully into London traffic.

They drove in silence for near-on ten minutes, squinting into the bright morning sun. Ginny's fingers carded softly through the hairs at the back of Harry's neck, and she hummed contentedly. In the back seat, Lily's theatrics had ceased, replaced now with a look of forlorn wistfulness; in his rearview mirror, Harry thought she looked far older than her nine years.

A few minutes later, just a short way from home, Harry signaled right at a stoplight. On their left, a tiny blond boy chattered happily at his grandfather, seemingly en route to the brightly-coloured park on the corner. An outdoor café entertained several studious undergrads and a pair of debating businesswomen, who were having little trouble ignoring the three contractors laughing loudly before of the hardware store next door.

Across the street, a dogwalker just barely avoided a tangled disaster involving two painters, three Yorkshire Terriers, and an awkwardly-erected scaffolding.

Ahead, a pretty young jogger flitted their way nimbly, her curly hair bouncing. Spotting the crowded sidewalk, she considered the Potters' idling car, looked both ways, and stepped smoothly into the street. Her eyes found Harry's as she loped towards their car, and with a widening of her eyes and a flicker towards his forehead, he knew she recognized him. She smiled hesitatingly, scoped out Ginny on his left, and then popped her chin out, focusing again on her stride.

She'd nearly made it halfway across the street when her left trainer found a manhole cover, stepped down hard, and exploded in a shower of red and green.

** "And how did that go?" George asks dryly, glancing up from his toast and his copy of the Owl Gazette. He's wearing someone else's glasses, and Harry's made mildly uncomfortable by how different it makes his face look - suddenly, George resembles Percy in studious regard and stature, and it is... Incredibly wrong. Fred isn't anywhere to be seen, and it's early in the morning; neither Hermione nor Draco have made their way into the great hall yet.

"Take those off," Harry says, and George puts them on the top of his head. "What are they?"

"Study specs, something I'm playing with." George passes them over, and Harry takes them, momentarily hanging his own glasses in the collar of his robe as he slides them onto his nose. He has to squint to read the words in the Gazette, focusing exactly on the blurry lines of text, but once he does, he sees the way words are highlighted. Adverbs, nouns, adjectives, and underlined in red is a misprint in the text - one of the reporters had misspelled the word "commitment" as "comittment". "What do you think? Seems a bit better than spell-checking quills to me."

Harry nods his head, passing them back and sliding his own glasses back onto his nose, and George puts them back on, looking down at the page.

"I hate glasses on you," Harry says. "It's weird." George laughs. He leans back in his seat, putting the tip of his quill against the corner of his mouth, and he gives Harry a seductive wink. Harry kicks the bench out from under him, and he lets George drop onto the floor, laughing even more - laughing his head off, in fact. "It is." George pulls himself up off the ground, dragging the bench up with him, and he grins at Harry, pulling the glasses off and making a few adjustments to them with a little screwdriver.

"You got a thing for glasses, Harry, my lad?" he asks lightly, and Harry rolls his eyes.

"Yeah," Harry answers. "It's a thing called short-sightedness." He turns back to the mirror, letting the tip of his finger brush tenderly over the edge of the mirror's gilded edge. It's warm to the touch, but it isn't actually too hot anymore. Picking the mirror up, he examines it, turning it over between his hands, and then says, "It didn't go well." George nods his head seriously, giving the mirror a suspicious glance, but he doesn't say anything more. Harry sets the mirror aside and settles beside the other boy, taking a slice of toast for himself and taking a bite.

"Surely you're not giving up?" George asks mockingly as he replaces his glasses.

"For this morning, anyway," Harry mutters, and he pages absently through his Potions textbook. "I've Snape first thing."

"Oh, good for you," George says. "Maybe he'll give you a hand, be nice and helpful, like." Harry sniggers, and he gives Fred a wave as he comes in.

"Oh, looking good, dear brother!" Fred proclaims, and he reaches immediately for the spectacles, plucking them off George's face and putting them on his own. Somehow, Fred looks even worse than George had with them on, and Harry winces visibly. "What, think you've got the monopoly on glasses, Potter?"

"They make you look like Percy," Harry says. Letting out a quiet shriek of horror, Fred tears the glasses off and drops them onto a plate of bacon. George shakes his head, muttering something about being the superior twin, and takes them back. Fred grins at George, waggling his eyebrows at his brother, and plucks pages six and seven out from between the pages of the Owl Gazette that George is reading - the sports section.

** Palmira Entwhistle was three-and-a-half days into her new job as Senior Undersecretary to the Minister for Magic when she, unfortunately, died.

When questioned by Aurors, the two Security Wizard, her intern, and her Assistant, Marjorie, were all quite uncertain how she died, except to say that it wasn't an accident, given the difficult angle that it would have taken to aim a spell at her own back, as well as the post-mortem beheading that befell poor Palmira.

Whatever their shortcomings as detectives, all four could soundly confirm that Mrs. Entwhistle entered her office around one or half-past, shut the door, and could be heard pacing back and forth within for near on twenty minutes, muttering to herself. Then she opened the door, requested a seven o'clock Portkey to a home in Devonshire, and returned to her office and the pacing and the muttering until close to three, when all sounds ceased therein. At roughly quarter to seven, ready to put her long day of pretending to be busy behind her, Marjorie gathered up the Senior Undersecretary's Portkey and some briefing scrolls and knocked once, twice, three times on the office door before pushing it wide open and slipping inside to find Mrs. Entwhistle at her desk, decidedly dead.

** This isn't related to anything that I'm currently writing, though the idea of a HP/Final Fantasy fusion fic is quite appealing :)

/A glimmer in the shadows. A wrinkle in the void./

/A Crystal takes form. A world is born./

*And the 'ags don't bite,*

*Ho- "*

"Why don't you pack it /in/, Weasel? Goddess knows how I haven't burst an eardrum, yet."

A chorus of hearty guffaws rumbled down the bend of the narrow, rugged valley, flaring as it reached its target. A handful of armoured troops leered over their shoulders at the gangly, red-haired minstrel, who smouldered from his place at the rear of the party. In his lapse of concentration, the neck of Weasel's lute clipped his Hippogriff's ear, which squawked and ruffled its feathers in alarm. Weasel managed to fumble the instrument in all of the panic, and it met its dissonant end under the talons of his unruly mount.

"Sounds like Weasel's plucked his last feather!" jeered one of the troops, squinting and baring his ratty teeth to the rest of the company. The laughter reached fever pitch.

Draco allowed himself a muffled snort as he tugged on the reins of his stallion, Kettlebelly. The beast complied, pivoting on the spot to allow him a better view.

He felt his chest swell as three score swordsmen wheeled their companions around in perfect synchronisation - all in the name of observing the Alban embarrassment that was their "Bard", Ronald Weasley.

What meagre use the King's Paladins could find in a Bard had yet to present itself, but Draco's father insisted on the muppet's enlistment. From what little he had learned, Weasley was supposedly the son of an airship engineer. In a certain light, it made perfect sense: the contraptions lay claim to death tolls which rivalled Weasley's capacity for failure.

** Wrote this today as part of day 2 of NaNoWriMo.

--------------

There was a different Auror on guard duty when Hermione came to the entrance to the holding cells. "Who are you here to see?" the dark haired man asked after checking and retaining her wand.

"Prisoner #34," she answered.

"Oh, you must be the missus," he said. He leered at her before turning and escorting her down a different corridor. She wanted to react, to yell at the Auror that she wasn't 'the missus,' she wasn't married to that Death Eater, but she held her tongue. She didn't know how much the guard knew of her situation and didn't want to spread any more of her business around than she had to. She was sure that if Rita Skeeter heard about these visits to the holding cells she'd be sure to spin the story in a way that was the least flattering, the least true, and the most sensational.

"Here you are, Ma'am," the Auror said as they approached a heavy door at the end of the short hall. "The conjugal suite," he smirked. "You can leave the room anytime you'd like, but you'd need my assistance to get back in, so make sure you have all your clothes when you leave." He heaved himself against the door to open it before holding it open with his arm. His position made it so that to walk in the room Hermione would have to practically rub her body against the man. She felt her upper lip raise in disgust and decided on the fly to use his misinformation against him.

"If you knew which prisoner is my husband, you wouldn't be attempting to take such liberties with my body," she said in her best impression of Narcissa Malfoy. "You will open this door properly so that I may walk in uninhibited," she demanded.

The guard flushed an unflattering puce color and smiled in embarrassment. His teeth were yellow and crooked. "Sorry, ma'am," he muttered and held the door wider for her to enter.

   :END:
“Why don't you go up to Bill and Charley's room?” Mum asked, gesturing at the staircase. “I will be with you shortly.”

I shrugged and nodded, then turned and started walking up the staircase. Bill and Charley's room was on the third floor of the Burrow, along with Dad's study, and the second bathroom. Other than the master room, their room had been the largest.

Across from the door, there was a large window that looked out over the front lawn. Under the window there was a big wooden dresser, that had piled atop it various magazines, comic books, two candleholders full of melted candle wax, and a photo frame that held a photo of a very pretty brown-haired witch.

To the left was a set of bunk-beds. To the right was a large wardrobe, a bookshelf, and Bill and Charley's old trunks stacked on top of each other. I guess Mum must had been in here to clean as the beds were made, and everything on the dresser was in neat stacks. Similar to my room, the walls were plastered in posters. But instead of the Chudley Cannons, they were more varying posters of the Weird Sisters, Puddlemere United, and the Gryffindor coat of arms.

After looking around, I went and sat on the bottom bunk of the bunk-beds and waited for Mum to show up. I did not have to wait long, as she walked in a moment later bearing a faded red wooden box in her arms.

After entering the room, Mum tapped the box with her wand, and it floated into the air in front of me. Its lid popped open and I saw what looked to be many different wands inside of it. The wands flowed out of the box and arranged themselves in a neat row in front of me. All in all, it looked like there was about 30 of them.

“Close your eyes, hold your hand over them, and try to get a feel for which ones seem to match you the best” Mum instructed. Nodding, I did as she asked, starting from the left and holding my right hand over each one in turn. Counting each as I went, it was not until wand number 23 that I felt a tingle of... something. I opened my eyes and noticed that my hand was hovering over a long, battered looking wand, that had a silvery glint at its tip.

“This one” I said, grasping it in my hand. Mum nodded. After putting the other wands back in the box, she held out her hand expectantly. I obliged and handed it to her.

“Ah, this was Charley's old wand!” She said as she looked it over “12 inches, ash, with a unicorn tail hair core. This wand once belonged to your great-grandfather, Ignatius Prewett, I believe.”

“I expect you to take good care of it” She said sternly, handing it back. “Now, let's sort out your other equipment, shall we?”

She waved her wand, and the two trunks jumped into the air from where they had been sitting, coming to a rest in front of me. One was black with steel fastenings and the other was red with brass fastenings. They both had an old, worn look to them, with cracked wood, peeling paint, and rusted fastenings and hinges.

“Which one would you like?” Mum asked. I pointed to the black one. Mum nodded and began to wave her wand in a complex pattern again. Both trunks popped open their lids, and inside each I saw what looked to be a very disorganized mess. After giving a very annoyed huff, Mum began to remove the trunks contents and organize them.

Clothes flowed out of the trunks and folded themselves, stacking neatly on the end of the bed. Various books and boxes also floated out of the trunks and set themselves in pairs. One pair of wide, flat boxes was marked in faded letters was Slug & Jigger's Standard Potions Kit. A pair of cubic boxes was marked Slug & Jigger's Glass Phial Set. Another pair was labeled Slug & Jigger's Scales and Weights.

Two pewter cauldrons were cleaned of soot and what looked like potion residue. Two battered telescopes were cleaned and repaired. Various parchment was stacked and tied up in twine, then placed on the bookshelf. Other bits and pieces of garbage, such as old ink bottles, broken quills, torn and ruined parchment, and old potions ingredients was vanished.

“May I see your book list, Ronald?” Mum asked after carefully inspecting the contents of the Slug & Jigger's boxes. I complied, pulling it out and handing it to her.

“The Defense book is new, we will have to get you a copy” she said as she read it. “But I think I have a copy of the others.”

With a wave of her wand, another trunk appeared with a quiet crack. It opened and I saw that it was full of old text books. Mum leaned down to look through them, and pulled out what looked like six copies of the books on my school list. They were stacked neatly in the black trunk, along with one of every pairs of equipment.

“Now, let's see if we can fit some of Bill's old robes on you.” Mum said as she turned to me. I gulped at the dangerous glint in her eye.

** Here is a new fic I am working on for NaNoWriMo. The character is a teacher for the Unusual Arts in HBP. I had to cut off the scene due to the length restrictions but I can share the rest ~550 more words) for anyone who is interested. 😊

--------------

What if they didn't like her? Or even worse, what if when she walked in, no one was there? What if literally no one signed up for her class? She took another deep breath, her lungs stretched, feeling tight. What if she wasn't ready for this yet?

Then we fake it, said her inner voice.

She nodded to herself and pushed open the door, taking long strides and head held high, just like McGonagall did the first time Morgana saw her enter her class. The light shone on her face, and once her eyes adjusted she couldn't help but smile.

There were at least twenty students currently gathered near her desk. She pushed back the tears that began to well in her eyes and continued to move forward behind the unsuspecting students. She had placed several items on the desk the night before in hopes that her introduction to the class would keep them all from dropping after the first day. She had to know which one was causing the commotion. She peered over the group to see, but it seemed there were multiple items they were inspecting, but luckily, not touching. She watched for a moment, listening to the different conversations.

“Look at that, what do you think it is?”

“Awww, that owl is so pretty!”

“What language do you suppose that book is in? It doesn't look like runes or anything I know.”

“Sweet knife! Looks seriously heavy though. Think it is?”

Here was her opening. She watched as the red headed boy reached for the black dagger. “I wouldn't do that if I were you. A Gijakpros is no toy.”

The by pulled his hand back like a child caught trying to steal candy from the pantry, looking at her with wide eyes. “A...a what?”

“A Gijakpros,” she said, a large smile breaking on her face. “Why don't you all sit down and I can show you.”

She was met with a mixed reaction. Some rushed to their chairs while others gave her a warry look before finding their seats.

“But first, an introduction. I am Professor Morgana and if you haven't found yourself to be lost, you are in the Obscure Arts. I am very pleased to see so many interested in the subject. This class is meant to teach you a multitude of magic that is not covered in your other courses, from completely new subjects to expansions of other subjects that are rarely covered. For example, we will be study wand making and patronus casting as well as xylomancy, a type of divination. We will also cover druid magic, arcane arts, and healing. There will be much more, but we will cover that as we go.”

A hand shot up. “Professor Gore...”

“Please, Professor Morgana,” she said with a smile. “Yes, Miss...?”

“Hermione Granger ma'am.”

“Yes, Miss Granger.”

“We didn't receive a book assignment for this course. Do you have them for us?”

“No, Miss Granger.” She notice the girl go a bit paler at her words. “You must understand, much of the magic we will be learning does not have many books to study. Yes, there are a multitude of books on healing, wand making, and the mind arts; however you will find near nothing on items such as necromancy, voodoo, or the druid practice of entering an animal's mind outside of the restricted section. Therefore, our class will be discussion and practice based where applicable and practical.”

“So, no books?” asked Harry Potter, the scar was a dead giveaway.

“No,” she said, chuckling at the excited faces many of the students developed. “However, that means lots of notes must be taken. No books does not mean no tests.”

Less smiles.

Again, the girl raised her hand with vigor. “Yes, Miss Granger.”

“You said necromancy. Isn't that a dark magic?”

“Some say it is.”

“Then why are we learning it?” she asked, her brow furling as her speech hastened. “We won't need it and we shouldn't be using it.”

“Let me counter your question with another question. What makes dark magic dark?”

“It harms others,” she countered.

“Alright, what else?”

“It's evil,” said a Hufflepuff girl.

“And what does that mean, to be evil?” There a silence that washed over the class. “Hard to define beyond the word isn't it. Evil is harmful. Dark magic, if I remember from Defense, is magic that is used to harm, control, or kill the victim. Pretty terrible stuff, yes?”

The class nodded, though she noted that several were paying much closer attention than they had been a while ago. “So, what about magic that does none of those things? Is it dark?”

“Of course not,” said Ravenclaw boy. “Empirically, it does not meet the definition.”

Morgana smiled at the class and leaned back on her desk. “So, of course the Unforgivables are dark magic for those reasons, poisons, breeding of basilisks, and sacrifice rituals would be dark magic?”

She saw some of the students nod quickly, while others nodded slowly, obviously questioning where she was going with this. “What about summoning, the creation of golems from the earth, casting spells that create wards or break curses, or liquid communication?”

“Those don't hurt people,” said Harry.

“No they don't,” she said, “and yet the blood magic used to do these things is considered dark magic.”

She picked up the blade the boy had been inspecting earlier. “This is a Gijakpros, an obsidian blade used in blood magic. The caster uses it to break the skin and release the blood needed to conduct the spell. This can be their own blood or the blood of another depending on the spell to be cast.”

** From a upcoming chapter of The Betrothal Situation

'Daphne Greengrass was curious. She had seen her housemate, Draco Malfoy, leave the confines of the Slytherin Common Room to head to parts unknown to her. Daphne knew that it wasn't Prefect duties that he was going to do as she was the Sixth Year Prefect, alongside her betrothed Blaise Zabini.

Daphne hated the Malfoy scion for several reasons, both personal and business wise, if one could describe inter house affairs as business. Firstly there was the fact that the blonde haired teen had a habit of continually antagonising Harry Potter, the Head of the Ancient and Most Noble House of Potter (which was the House responsible for the initial creation of the Great Alliance, the Wizengamot group which her family was part of). That, as well as the fact that he was responsible for most of Slytherins point reductions within Hogwarts was a point which angered Daphne.

The third reason that Daphne hated the self proclaimed 'Prince of Slytherin' was because, despite being betrothed at birth to Pansy Parkinson, the ponce had attempted, on numerous occasions the previous year, to rape her sister Astoria.

Daphne knew that despite the counselling sessions and the medically induced memory charms, Astoria still had flashbacks from the attack, an attack that the blonde haired male got his father to arrange for it to be swept under the carpet, spending a significant amount of gold to do so.'

** Second half of my very unwritten second attempt at a fic titled 'Damned'. Not actually centred around a cannon character. Apologies if the formatting gets screwed up in transfer.

“So, they allowed the Abomination to come to Hogwarts then. My father will be disgusted when he hears of this. I wouldn't even bother unpacking if I were you. I shouldn't think that you'll be here for long.” No one came to his defence, why would they? But everyone's attention was suddenly drawn to him and those who were ignorant about him looked confused. The words were to be expected, but that didn't make them hurt any less. It did surprise him though that someone could know what he was, and presumable had heard what he could do, and yet still tried to rile him up. Was the boy simply brave? Stupid? Overly arrogant? Perhaps all of those or none. “Draco Malfoy, how nice to meet you again. I shouldn't bother running to Lucius. He knew months ago that I would be coming here and yet, here I am.” His voice was soft, so soft that the other students waiting on the stair had to lean in to hear him. It made for quite an amusing spectacle really, all of them leaning in while staying as far away as they thought they could get away with on the stairs without disobeying the Deputy Headmistress' instructions to stay where they were.\\
Malfoy opened his mouth to respond but was interrupted by the return of Professor McGonagall. “Please follow me in an orderly fashion, everything is ready for the sorting.”

--------------

She paused before she called his name. No, she did more than that. She stopped and turned to look at the Headmaster; perhaps seeking confirmation that he truly wanted this. Dumbledore simply smiled serenely at her and motioned for her to continue with a gently wave of a hand. She almost managed to say his name without stutter. Almost. “Gaunt, Mortis.” He walked forward to the front of the Great Hall, all the while keeping his eyes focussed upon the old man in front of him. When he reached the stool, he turned and sat down on it gracefully and without hurry. “Mr Gaunt, you need to remove your hood in order for the sorting hat to be able to sort you.” The hooded head looked up at her, the face still invisible within the fabric's depths. “Are you quite sure that you want me to do that Professor? You know what I look like, it might cause some of them some.... Distress.” He sounded so courteous, so conscientious and polite. The words even sounded genuine, but his words left Professor McGonagall cold inside. He reminded her so much of... the other one. But of course, that was only to be expected, wasn't it?\\
“I am quite certain Mr Gaunt, unless you think that you know more about how student have been sorted at this school for the past millennium that I do?” Mortis did not deign to reply. Instead, he looked back towards the rest of the students, bathing in the looks they were giving him and the emotions that were almost visibly rolling off many. Slowly, he reached up to the sides of his head and pinched the fabric of his hood between his fingers. Carefully, he pulled backwards and let the hood fall away to reveal his face. Some of them actually screamed,

** This from a Genderbender Romance fic I started working last years and i'm picking it up for NaNoWriMo to see where I can take it

--------------

“I will go change in the lavatory” Ron and Harry exchanged a glance “You should change into your uniforms” and with that she left

“Some things never change, eh?” Said Harry, Ron grinned at him and opened his trunk and took out his hand-me-down clothes and robes he started to undress, he was about to remove his worn out jeans when he looked at Harry.

She had already removed almost all her clothes but the black tight fabric Ron guessed was a bra and a pair of boxer shorts. Ron quickly adverted his sight feeling a bit hot in the face.

“Do you have to wear that?” Ron could see from the corner of his eye Harry slowly turning towards him.

“What?”

“That thing mate don't make me spell it for you” Ron said without looking at Harry

“The--- this?” he pulled at the elastic fabric in her shoulder “Well I don't have to, but my aunt wouldn't let me go out if I wasn't wearing one, she brought them for me” Harry remained silent for a moment while she pulled up the school's gray pants “...I simply got used to using them and find it kind of weird not wearing them now” Harry started to button up her shirt “at least it hasn't any lace you wouldn't believe the crap the sales lady wanted me to wear” she started to do her tie at the same time as Ron “I couldn't believe so little fabric could be so expensive” She grimaced, Ron looked at the fully clothed Harry, she looked kind of funny, he had never seen a girl wear the Hogwarts' male uniform.

“You look weird” Said Ron, Harry glared back, “I mean I've never seen a girl wearing the male---”

“I'm not a girl” Said Harry trough his clenched teeth

“I Know! I Know! But you look like one, I'm just telling that---”

“Let's not talk about it.” there was an awkward pause which was interrupted by the sound of the compartment door opening they both stared at Hermione in her Hogwarts uniform, Ron for a moment thought Hermione had heard them

“You won't believe who I saw” she said as she sat beside Ron

“Who?” Said Ron and Harry.

“Malfoy” Ron looked at Harry and Harry stared back, they both turned to Hermione

“Hermione, you know we are in the Hogwarts Express right?” said Ron delicately as if talking to a really stubborn six years old, Hermione huffed and crossed her arms.

“That's not what I meant; I meet him outside the lavatories, he was alone for once and when he saw me he just continued his way without even a sneer or something”

“Hermione, It sound like you want Malfoy to be mean to you” said Harry, thankfully for Ron he wasn't drinking anything or he would have spat it all over the place, he ended just choking making him cough like an old grandpa. Hermione looked at him, closed her eyes and shook her head.

“Of course not Harry, What I mean he is out of his modus operandi”

“His what?” said Ron when he finally was able to breathe normally again.

“Modus ope--- you know what? I don't want to waste time explaining you that” she paused for a moment to take breath probably to calm herself and count to ten “You must have seen him he looked terrible”

“Good” said Ron

“Yeah the git deserves it”

“Guys---”

“No, Hermione, you know the little git deserves everything he is getting, I just wish he had gotten caught with his Death Eater father” said Harry with a little shake of anger in his voice

“But---”

“Hermione,” said Ron “you are being too nice, remember how he has treated us, how many times he called you the M-word. I think Harry is right, he got it light” Hermione was silent for a moment, and sighed loudly

“You are right the prat deserves it”

They continued to chat aimlessly until the train started to slow off, outside the express's windows Ron could see the dark sky dotted with stars and a vast dark forest that expanded to the horizon and Hogsmeade station.

** October 31st. Halloween. Voldemort sneered at the filthy muggle children scurrying past, casting a few wandless curses at any who brushed against him. Godric's Hollow's children would suffer a serious outbreak of immunodeficiency over the coming months. One, who had the misfortune of dressing as the wicked witch of the west, wouldn't make it through the night after her appendix burst suddenly.

Beside him, the pathetic little rat Pettigrew cringed every time his hand waved. The rat was leading him to the Potters. He was loathe to kill a magical couple as strong as them though, so he had Pettigrew get them out of the house for the night. Powerful wizards were important, and it wasn't like they would birth ANOTHER chosen one. Dropping hints for Snape, suggesting that some very ancient and dangerous things were aligning tonight and therefore he would be busy doing ritual after ritual had ensured the Potters wouldn't decide to stay home just in case. He cackled quietly and Pettigrew looked like he was about to wet himself. The fools of the light were so "pure" they wouldn't even risk checking dark books for confirmation of his claims.

Approaching the newly revealed "safe house", Voldemort glanced at Pettigrew again. "They hired a little mudblood as a babysitter, yes?" Pettigrew nodded frantically. "Excellent. Stay out here. If the Potters get back before I'm done, stun them." Then he raised his wand and pointed it at the door. A few flicks and the wards surrounding it were torn down. He set up his own anti-apparition and anti-portkey wards with another set of flicks, and calmly blasted the door open. He could hear the mudblood scream, and she was no doubt racing up the stairs to the nursery, if her loud footfalls were anything to go by. Wonderful, he'd follow her. No need to search every room in the house when he could be led right to the one he wanted.

Voldemort gave his trademark insanely evil laugh and calmly strolled up the stairs, bursting into the room the mudblood had fled to. She stood trembling before the single crib, wand pointed at the door.

"Stu-"

"Avada Kedavra," Voldemort cut her off, watching her fall. He stepped over her body to examine the children. Both stared up at him with bright green eyes swimming with potential.

He sighed. "Such a shame, killing two pureblood children." Ah well. The man hummed. "Which one is the prophecy referring to, I wonder. Not that it matters, since I'll get them either way, but still. A shame to have to kill both." He briefly entertained the thought of taking the twins and raising them as his own. Vanquish could take on so many different meanings. For all he knew, they could fulfill the prophecy by beating him in Exploding Snap, and if Pettigrew's information was correct these two would grow to be immensely powerful. On the other hand, he had absolutely no desire to take care of two kids, and trusted a grand total of zero followers with raising his potential downfall. The only one he trusted to drill in their heads to never betray him was Bellatrix, and he wanted her nowhere near impressionable young minds.

No, keeping them wouldn't work at all. So with a shrug he spun around and aimed his wand over his shoulder. "Avada Kedavra." Glancing back, he saw a scorch mark on the wall just below the ceiling and frowned, lowering the tip of his wand and facing forward again. "Avada Kedavra." Closer. "Avada Kedavra."

"GONG!" Voldemort paused. What? That was an odd sound to hear. He had plenty of experience casting the killing curse and not once was that sound associated with it. What hap-PAIN! PAINPAINPAIN! It was the familiar indescribable, otherworldly agony of his soul being torn except far worse mixed with the pain of SOMETHING being drawn from him. He didn't even have time to scream before his body exploded. And then nothing.

** Minister Fudge. He liked that, in fact, he thought to himself he'd never get sick of hearing that. Now Bagnold had gone and his campaign was successful he was the most important person in magical Britain. He'd just got back having introduced himself to the muggle Prime Minister and it was time to think. The name Fudge wasn't all that well respected within wizarding circles, it wasn't an ancient or noble name but by Merlin would Cornelius put them on the map. Fudge had a plan, an ambitious plan, he needed something to endear himself to the people, a coup of sorts to show that he was the most powerful, the smartest and he was Britain's best choice in all elections. Already he'd heard rumours he ran to Dumbledore for advice but no he would prove them wrong. It had to be something that would win him supporters within the ministry and something that would make the public love him. Harry Potter was his target. The Boy-Who-Lived, rumour had it Dumbledore had hidden away the boy with muggles, that simply wouldn't do, the boy was an icon in the wizarding world, a symbol of hope, he belonged with them. The mystery of how the boy had survived the killing curse was something the unspeakables were dying to know and Fudge could see the value in it to. Imagine if he, Cornelius Fudge, brought back Harry Potter, leading to a defense against the killing curse, the public would see him as a hero and he'd go down in history forever.
