Basically she is invited by the Malfoys to live in the manor and they come up with an arrangement to get Harry to go there so that Voldermort to kill him. Hermione discovered the Malfoys are very generous to their neighbourhood/community. Also a scene with deers...It's a pretty twisted fic.

Anyone read this? Ive been looking for it for 2 years now ...


** Personally I don't know but if you have a LiveJournal account or don't mind creating one, you can ask over at the [[http://dramione.livejournal.com/][Dramione's LiveJournal page]]. If anyone would know the answer to your question, it would be someone there. Good luck!
