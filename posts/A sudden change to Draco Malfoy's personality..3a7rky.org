I don't mean a 'Harry is in Slytherin therefore they are friends' fic. I mean like a redo fic where Draco travels back, or some kind of possession /epiphany.


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7437809/1/The-Last-Second-Chance][A slytherin at war]] is pretty good and what you're looking for. Regrettably, the sequel isn't completed.

  AU, time travel. Voldemort won and Harry lost. Life under Lord Voldemort's rule isn't what the Purebloods thought it would be... so a half-baked plot to twist time to save their sorry hides is concocted. But will it work? [WIP]

  Time travel. It's always about Potter. Draco Malfoy doesn't like that fact, but there is no one else who has the power to change the world. Sending his memories to his younger self he hopes to create a better future. Intelligent Grey Draco. No slash.

  Time Travel. A disillusioned Draco Malfoy sends his soul back in time to keep Voldemort from winning the war. What's a cunning, ambitious eleven-year-old to do in such a situation? Oddly enough, it might not be what a person would think.
