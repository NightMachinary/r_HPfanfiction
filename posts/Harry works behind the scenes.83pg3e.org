I would like a fanfiction where Harry influences and does a lot without anyone noticing. I would also like crossovers if you have any to reccomend.

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.
