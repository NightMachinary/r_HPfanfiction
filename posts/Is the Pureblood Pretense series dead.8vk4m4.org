The last update was in August 2017, which is still less than a year ago, but, has there been any sign that the author is still working on it?


** Statistically speaking? Probably.

This is a common thing I have seen in the fandom (and others) where multi-year epics are started. Fics go for a few years, then life gets in the way or the author loses interest. Often the author will come back and drop a chapter a year or two later saying the fic is not dead/abandoned, then you never hear from them again. Here are some examples:

- Sitra Ahra
- Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived
- Ectomancer
- What You Leave Behind
- On the Way to Greatness
- Forging the Sword
- Harry Potter and the Unlocked Knowledge
- Hogwarts Battle School (this one and HP and the Natural 20 are the most recent example of this recurrence that I can name)
- Harry Potter and Nightmares of Future Past
- Prince of the Dark Kingdom

I could go on but I won't. The thing is, almost no multi-year stories are actually finished. The ones that usually finish are ones where they stick mostly to canon or they wrote a fic with a very specific change they wanted to show in the HP universe (ex. most of Darth Marrs and Starfox5's fics). Almost no fics that focus on magical exploration/learning/development are ever finished, probably because it requires more planning (though that part is just my speculation).

Just learn to accept these things is the best advice I can offer you. The best advice I can offer with regard to fanfiction reading is that you should go into every fic expecting it /not/ to be finished, and be pleasantly surprised if it is.

You're wrong there. My fics get finished because a) I only start a story when I have the ending already planned and b) I stick to a fixed writing schedule - one chapter per week. That's it.

**** I sort of think that goes hand in hand. You know where you want your story to go, what its about, and probably have a general outcome for most of the characters arcs (if they have one) prior.

But most of the fics I mentioned (and others) it reads very clearly that they did not have a final plan for where things were going. If you don't have an endgame, it usually just grinds to a halt eventually.

Just my two cents.

****** Magical exploration /does/ require more planning. If you have a no-plan writer and they change one seemingly simple thing about how one aspect of magic works, it can quickly snowball and pretty soon, an inexperienced writer with no plan will become overwhelmed and quit.

For example, in California Dreamin' I introduce the concept of a Blood Seal for guarding your home. Anyone who's not on it must be invited in by someone who is. Pretty simple on the face of it, but there are a lot of things to consider.

•Does it block spells or items? (No.)

•What about animals? (No.)

•How often does it have to be renewed? (Depends on how many visitors you have across your threshold. Most are good for about six months. Harry's paranoid and does his once a month.)

•Does it prevent exit? (No.)

•Is it tamper-proof? (No, but the owner of the Seal is immediately aware and breaking it causes pretty awful magical feedback on the breaker.)

•Why doesn't everyone have one? (Blood magic is old and out of favor. Alarm spells are better, aren't they?)

And so on and so forth. This is just one new thing that I chose to explore in my story and it brings up a lot of questions and requires a lot more planning rather than simply going with straight canon magic. If you have a writer who doesn't think ahead you either end up with a mishmash that doesn't make sense or a dead story.

******* Well, I'd consider that general world building. Not really different compared to making up a country.

Say I make up the Magical Ottoman Empire. There are a lot of things to consider:

- What's the country's ruling system?

- What are the country's borders?

- What's the country's relationship with its neighbours?

- What's the country's stance on muggleborns?

- What's the country's stance on sapient magical creatures?

- What's its relation to Wizarding Britain?

And I would say that "simply going with straight canon magic" results in about as many questions in many cases since JKR didn't really cover most plot devices in such detail.

********** Which I didn't mean. Sorry it came across that way.

What I meant is that stories where that is what the focus is usually do not have the level of planning that you're fics do. I thought I was complimenting you on that actually.

******* Magical exploration requires thinking carefully about the implications of things that you add. This includes not contradicting anything you've already published. It's easier to do this when you've planned out those aspects of magic in advance. You can do that and then start writing without having planned any aspect of the plot.

*** I mean i'm usually pretty accepting when it comes to ead fics, but I discovere the deadness quite abruptly after devouring the first two years in nearly a single sitting, and it hit a lot harder than it usually does for some reason.

**** That could be for several reasons.

Its one of the only fem!Harry stories that I would consider good, and probably one of only five or six with fem!Harry going to Hogwarts that I can say are actually interesting.

It might also be that its in separate books, so you didn't see the current status of the latest book in the series. So sort of a sucker punch there.

Or it might be that you personally felt a connection to Harriet (or whoever) in here and you don't like the feeling that they just "ended."

It sucks, but on the other hand it could have just not existed at all too.

** It's not dead!!!!! Violet's sister said there would be an update within a week or so. So that means Violet has at least been working on it. Honestly I would be so sad if this series died, but I think it's more that we're in for the long haul. At least we get at least one novel-length chapter a year rather than waiting years and years for one giant book (*cough* Game of Thrones *cough* Kingkiller Chronicles *cough*)
