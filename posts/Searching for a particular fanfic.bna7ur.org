There was one with language lozenges that he buys from an alley that is NOT knockturn or diagon but some other one that was run by muggle borns


** I remember this, it was a travel shop and he bought a fancy bag there I think, too. Might have been after getting a custom wand made at a shop that wasn't Ollivander. I'll think about it and try to search old fics if nobody else comes up with it.

**** Fate's Gamble by Lupine Horror. Chapter 3.

An old guilty pleasure, nice over-the-top example of a lot of tropes. I couldn't find the bit I remembered about a custom wand shop, so I must be mixing up old indy!Harry fics. Or the idea isn't unique!

  Gilderoy Lockhart. The one person in the books who was there at a pivotal moment and could have made a difference but was utterly unable to. Until a dimension traveler took over his position.

  Death wants free of its Master and proposes sending Harry back in time to avoid the unnecessary deaths in fighting Voldemort. Harry readily accepts, thinking he'll start anew as a Firstie. Instead, Harry's soul, magic, and memories end up at the beginning of Second Year --- in GILDEROY LOCKHART!
