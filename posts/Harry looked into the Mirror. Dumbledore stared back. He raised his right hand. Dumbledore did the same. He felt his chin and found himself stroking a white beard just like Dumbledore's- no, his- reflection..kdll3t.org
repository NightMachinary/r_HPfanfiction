#+TITLE: Harry looked into the Mirror. Dumbledore stared back. He raised his right hand. Dumbledore did the same. He felt his chin and found himself stroking a white beard just like Dumbledore's- no, his- reflection.

After Defense Against the Dark Arts, Charms was probably the class Harry was most competent at. He still struggled with it as he did any other, but there was a link between charms and DADA due to Jinxes, Hexes and Curses being their own kinds of Charms.

This was why, in a bid for some extra credit to raise his overall grade in his fourth year and first ever uneventful year of Hogwarts, he decided to do an extra credit project for Charms. Not an easy one either.

He wanted to achieve a spell version of the infamous Polyjuice potion. The year went by and he kept practicing. he talked with Professor Flitwick. he worked hard at it in empty classrooms with Ron and Hermione occasionally appearing as his willing volunteers under the watchful eyes of Professor Flitwick and Madame Pomfrey.

It was during a late night practice session at the end of the year when it happened. He hadn't told anyone where he was as he had thought he'd be back before anyone noticed he was gone, but he'd gotten so caught up in his work he'd lost track of time.

He'd been halfway through casting the spell when the door had suddenly swung open and Harry lost his concentration, caught off-guard by Dumbledore himself walking in. The spell cast and Harry saw a burst of light in the room before blackness overtook his vision.

He woke up feeling not at all like himself. With confusion, he stood only to find himself far to tall and in clothes most certainly not his own. He walked over to the first reflective surface he could find in the room he had awoken in. He found a mirror.

Harry looked into the Mirror. Dumbledore stared back. He raised his right hand. Dumbledore did the same. He felt his chin and found himself stroking a white beard just like Dumbledore's- no, his- reflection.

He'd later find, the spell had worked too well. Not only had he taken on Dumbledore's appearance but the headmaster now looked like Harry. Everyone believed Harry to be the headmaster and until Harry could develop a counter charm...

he'd have to play the part.


** A change in perspective is honestly what both of them need. I hope someone has a creative idea or two to run with this prompt.

** Albus walks in the Gryffindor common room, a smile on his lips when he steps into his old dorm. Whistling a little tune he searches for Ms Granger and Mr Weasley. He knows Harry would spend his evening with them. It doesn't take him very long. Ms Granger and Mr Weasley are arguing about something. Very loudly. Nobody else seems concerned. Albus decides it is better to help them through their struggle and beginn to talk with them. They give him strange looks but he can't look in their thoughts - not only would that be very rude, he also is pretty sure that Harrys Magic isn't up for such tasks yet. After they are calm again he announces that he would go to sleep - it is a school night after all. He makes a few steps before he hears the shout of: "Stupefy!" Albus turns around, but it is to late. A stunner in the back isn't something he expects in the Gryffindor common room.

Albus wakes up in the hospital wing. When looking around he sees his own body in the bed next to him.

"I told you that you can't fool Ron and Hermione" says Harry.

"And who got you?" Albus asks calmly. "My bet is on Minerva."

"Snape" Harry growls.

"Professor Snape, Harry" Albus corrects amused.

** I kinda stopped at the title and didn't read it completely.

#+end_quote

Harry left the room, his thoughts racing a mile a minute. Was becoming the next Dumbledore in his future? It seemed so distant, so unachievable. Or---he still remembered Hermione's time turner---perhaps Dumbeldore /was/ his future self? An overwhelming burden, one that he had to bear or be erased from time. Or was it just a lark, like a fun house mirror? It did sound like something the Twins would do.

* * *

The door behind Harry shut, and Dumbledore stepped through the empty frame, making his way to the exit as well. But the door opened again, and Dumbledore found himself face to face with another Dumbledore.

"Severus, while I do not object to this type of execrise for using Legilimency to anticipate your opponent's movements," the newcomer spoke, "I must object to your appropriating my face while doing it."

** Seems like a fun crack idea, but can't he cast the charm again to swap back?

*** Possibly, but as the charm is experimental, he can't know if that would result in a swap back, the charms layering, the effects becoming permanent, exploding, or any of the many, many other options.
