Ok so I have read lots of fanfiction and I had just re-read "perfect situations" by Jeconias (I recomend it). It is said to be the fic that completly started off the whole daphne/harry ship and created the template for Daphne's charecter that many use today. Of course because she is essentially OC her personality changes but is generally blonde with blue eyes, very beautiful, pureblood, and is normally quite aloof and cold, an "Ice Queen" as she is often refered as.

It is quite interesting where these consepts come from. For example, where did magical lords come from? Or who was the first to use a wandcrafter in a story? Who used the first marriage contract? It's likley it all started in one place, maybe a reddit post or a fanfic and then it simply spiralled but I honestly have no clue.

I don't know if any of these are backed up in the smaller things J.K puts out as, while I have re-read the books several times, that is all I have really bothered with besides the films. So if there is confirmation of these things in Canon please correct me.


** I think it's difficult to pinpoint the origin. I think it's likely that there were Daphne fics before that one. However it's maybe easier to point to fics that popularised certain tropes. For instance robst for all his faults did very likely popularise a lot of things in the harmony section simply because his presence on ff.net is quite large (in terms of favourites, follows and number of stories).

*** That makes sense, it would likely be almost impossible to pinpoint the exact origin but popularity is definetly extremly important. You could have 10 H/D fics realeased on the same day or even before that one and it would still get the credit. It makes sense that that would be how it would work though.

** I think it's a thing of â€œoh this story is really good now I want to write or want someone to write something with this in it and more and more people read and write those stories. Basically one or a few stories popularize a concept and it snowballs.

** [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Main_Page][Fanlore]] is a great resource for these types of questions

For the first two about magical lords and wandcrafters - I tried searching for those and didn't find much, but I'd assume those might just be twists on canon since we have "Lord" Voldemort and wizards like Ollivander who's a wandmaker

Not sure about marriage contract, but the [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Marriage_Law_Challenge][Marriage Law]] trope started out with a Snamione fest challenge from 2003

** A lot of those are taken whole-sale from general victorian-era stories about lords, ladies and political intrigue. They just added some magic in the mix but the general idea is older than HP itself.
