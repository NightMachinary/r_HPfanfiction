I am currently writing a fic where french characters feature quite prominently, and some of them have an accent, how do I put it to writing in satisfying way? Any tips?

I would also like to feature Hagrid, but I can't get a fix of his accent in a satisfying way, and while I can eventually say that the french eventually managed to reduce their accents, Hagrid is a different case.


** Some tips for Fleur (the main French-accent we see in the books):

- Most of her 'th'-starting words which have a vowel after it will change to 'z'-starting. I.e. The, ze; they, zey; them, zem; those, zose; etc. But not always. Sometimes she says 'theenk', 'the', etc. Words like three, throw, etc. don't change (because they have a consonant after the 'th').

- The 'th' rule also applies to the middle or end of words, i.e. mother, muzzer; with, wiz; is, eez; etc. But not always.

- Any words with an audible 'H' gets that letter replaced with an apostrophe. I.e. Harry, 'Arry; Hogwarts, 'Ogwarts; Hagrid, 'Agrid. But words like hour, honour, etc. stay as is.

- Uses Dumbly-dorr instead of Dumbledore, although this is mostly in the case of Madame Maxime.

- Occasionally slips in a French word or two among the English ones.

- Some words with i gets changed to ee. I.e. Christmas, Chreestmas; Mister, Meester; etc. But not always, as Fleur doesn't change 'little' to anything, for example.

- -eir or -ere sounds sometimes become -air. I.e. their, zair; there, zair; etc.

- (Not strictly in the books), but French speakers occasionally ignore the this vs that proximity. I.e. something could be far away but they might refer to it as 'this'.

There might be more changes in the books, I'm not sure.

As for Hagrid, the main things are:

- Uses words like blimey, crikey, etc.

- Replaces 'something' or 'something like that' with 'summat'.

- Most, but not all, of his 'you's get turned into 'yeh's. Basically all of his 'your's become 'yer's, you're becomes yeh're or yer (sometimes), etc.

- Combines should, could, would, etc. + have into shoulda, coulda, woulda, etc.

- Cuts off the t's on a good portion of his words but not always. I.e. "Harry, yeh migh' be interested ter know tha' them Skrewts are growin' real fast." (Not a book quote.) Also, as can be seen, sometimes Hagrid says -in' instead of -ing.

- Sometimes uses 'me' instead of 'my', 'meself' instead of 'myself', etc.

- Replaces 'to', 'for', with 'ter', 'fer', even in the middle of words, i.e. together, tergether; tomorrow, termorrow; forget, ferget; etc.

- Often uses 'bin' instead of 'been'.

- Uses 'o instead of 'of'.

As always, it's not a set rule, so don't chop off every letter when applicable.

There might be more, I'm not sure.

*** Hi, Frenchy here, I just wanted to add that most French will say "Fank you" instead of "Thank you", and replace a lot of "th" with a "fff" sound. Some will also pronounce "the" like "ve" or "de" depending on the context.

Also a common struggle for us is the pronunciation of the "ed" at the end of a word. Most will always say "id" (rhymes with mead) or "'ead" (rhymes with bread). The rule of "'p', 'f', 's', 'ch', 'sh', 'k'" doesn't exist for us. So, for exemple, "shocked" will be pronounced "shock-'ead", and the game "Uncharted" is butchered "Eun-char-tiid" by journalists.

If you want a good exemple of strong French accent, go watch the Ubisoft E3 conference on YouTube (I can't, it just makes me cringe when I hear them speak. They don't even try.)

Edit to add: OP, please don't make your text unreadable by using too many written accent, keep it light. And don't just use Google translate if you want to insert a few French words in your text, ask a French to proof-read it :)

***** Expressions are the trickiest ;) a saying in English like "it rain like cats and dogs" wouldn't make any sense once translated. The French version could be "il pleut comme une vache qui pisse" (it rains like a pausing cow), but again sound weird when translated in English. Just an example but it's very common for expressions. So be very very VERY careful with those kind of translations, if you want anything you write in French to make sense.

I'd love to give you a hand if you need help, feel free to PM me when you have a question about French :).

Ps: honestly don't put too much pressure on yourself. I've read a lot of fanfic, with poorly written French, some I could decipher, some not, but for it to be so bad that I stopped reading the fic... It only happened once ;). French is hard, we know it. So don't worry too much :)

******* Yeah, depends on where in France, and level of politeness, that's why I said "could be" ;). In any case "il pleut des chats et chiens" doesn't make any sense in French, like "tall like three apples" in English, and expressions should never be translated literally.

** You have two choices when deciding how to write an accent. Do you want to write it phonetically? (How most people do it, with Fleur dropping Aitches and slurring Zes all over the place). Or would you rather do it in prose? ("Blah blah," She said, her lips curling around the French-accented English).

Really, that choice depends on if you're trying to show, or to tell. There are three parts to any dialogue - what they say, how they say it, and what it implies about other stuff - and that all changes depending on whether you're trying to show the Reader/POV Protagonist something or tell the Reader/POV Protagonist something. Remember, dialogue is there to convey information, and whether you're doing that through showing or telling, you want to keep the things you're trying to convey in mind. Specifically, does the accent add to that effort or take away from it?

If you're just wanting to do a French accent to tell the reader that a character is French, I'd say probably don't do that. If you're not overly familiar with a particular accent, it's very easy to get it wrong, and really... people aren't idiots. We know Fleur is French, and anyone else can also be easily understood as French if you say "Hey, these people came from Beauxbatons, and they have accents that the character notices, and Francois de OC Fromage said he was born in Marseille!" and otherwise state/imply it through the narrative itself. There are easier and less distracting ways than phonetics to convey that information about nationality.

And generally, everything else you want to 'tell' through dialogue is more easily done without the accent. A thing I've heard that I quite like for this is: 'Write dialect, imply accent'. After all, no matter the accent IRL, the words are still spelled the same, they're just pronounced differently. For example, a Brummie (person from Birmingham) might said 'aight' instead of 'alright'. It's not accent, because it's not a mispronunciation, it's actually dialect because it's a different word they're using. It's part of the words they say, not the way they say those words. So, you write the words they say (ie. the information they're trying to tell someone) and not how they say it, because in this case, the accent can detract. If you had a scene with Fleur and Harry coming across Bagman's corpse and she said something like:

"'Arry, ze corpse we found! Eet eez ze man from ze judging board! Meester, ah, ah, Bagman! We 'ave to tell your 'eadmaster at once!"

The accent, there, detracts. You're not focusing first on what was said - ie. the statement of events that have occurred and Fleur's observations and idea of what they should do about it - you're initially focusing on the accent and translating that in your head before you focus on what she said. The reader's attention is drawn to how she's saying what she's saying, rather than what she's actually saying. In this case, a minimal touch is far better for conveying the information she's verbally giving to Harry (and thereby us, as readers). If in that scene, she said this instead:

"'Arry! That corpse we found! It's the man from the judging board! Mister, ah, ah... Bagman! We must tell your 'eadmaster at once!"

Then it's a lot clearer - you know exactly what's happening, you're not distracted trying to work out what the heck she's saying through layers of 'ze's, and you can still take a lighter touch with the missing 'H's to give her a unique voice. In short, no accent is better for conveying information directly through dialogue.

So, that leaves implication. ie. What the way a person with an accent says things tells you about things other than what they're directly saying. To use an example from the books, Draco's exclamation of "You're next, Mudbloods!" in CoS implies to us that Draco is a bigot and is excited about the Muggleborns being hurt like Filch's cat was. It doesn't directly convey the information ("I hate Mudbloods and I hope you're all killed next, like Filch's cat was!"), it tells us that indirectly. So, how can accent help us with that?

As we've established, writing phonetically in an accent makes the content of a sentence more difficult to understand. So, you can use accent and that lacking or difficult comprehension to imply things unrelated to the content being directly conveyed by the dialogue itself. (eg. when Harry first meets Hagrid, emphasising the accent can heighten a reader's appreciation of Harry's feeling of being adrift and confused and too distracted to mentally translate the accent while first stepping into a world he knows nothing about, or Draco finding it hard to understand Victor's accent can help convey his inexperience, British-centricness, or xenophobia, or Fleur's accent can even convey that she's new to English and struggles with pronunciation and improves over the course of the story [but that's better done if it's accompanied with her actually saying those things and characters talking about them, IMO]).

And particularly if you want to make a point that the POV character doesn't understand what's being said, then that's a time to use accent or even language in telling (if you state "Harry had no idea what they were saying.") or showing (if you just leave it in French or in heavily-accented English with no indication Harry understands).

Essentially, phonetic accent will make your characters harder to understand, but if making your characters difficult to understand adds to the story or character, or just fits the personality of a particular Character you're writing from the POV of, writing it phonetically can be done. Otherwise, just write the speech in standard English (or whatever language you're writing in) and describe the accent in narrative.

In terms of actually how to write French and Hagrid Accents phonetically, I'd say everyone else has it covered - though something I find useful for accent stuff myself is the International Dialects of English Archive (IDEA). It covers a bunch of different people from different regions of France speaking English and can help you work out how to write that phonetically in a realistic, non-comical way. Hagrid's accent is also in there, under the 'England' section. It's a West Country accent, so check any place names mentioned in the West Country wikipedia article and compare them against the dialect archive to see what's right for you to use.

[[https://www.dialectsarchive.com/]]

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Country]]

TL:DR - Write what people say and take a light touch on the accent phonetics to help distinguish characters, unless writing how they say it adds something to your story or characters somehow and if you're writing phonetically, do some research to find out how the people with the accents you're writing actually speak. Otherwise, keep it mild/light and stick to just making a point of it in your prose - narrative description beats phonetic transcription for keeping your prose clear when writing accents.

*** Thank you for the write up! This perspective makes it easier to decide, and you're right, narrative description sounds better.

My intention is for it to vary depending on how good the person speaks English with 90% of them just changing names a bit ('Arry, 'Ogwarts) and exchanging words, and some minor characters having very strong accents that make them hard to understand(will probably reduce that).

For information, it's not Fleur, but Fleur's aunt called Gabrielle who initially drowned while young in the sea. But this time was saved by Harry(who back-reincarnated as James's cousin who initially died in childbirth.) And her family, young Appoline, and their parents.

As for Hagrid, I really like his character, but unlike other characters, I think adding some phonetics for his speech is necessary, if I write him speaking normally and the read it, it just doesn't feel right.

**** Sure, happy to help. The psychology of writing and prose is something that fascinates me, so any chance to do write-ups like this I take with delight. :)

For the record though, I'm not necessarily saying one is better than the other - they're just more suited for different purposes. If you wanna achieve something, you find the tool most appropriate for the job, so I was just saying that you have to decide what that 'job' is. Like, if you're trying to make the point that your POV character struggles to understand those minor characters, you can do so because that's a useful implication that shows the reader things about that character.

And cool. Reincarnation as new people is fun. :)

And I can see your point for Hagrid, but I'd still recommend against making it too strongly phonetic. Full Hagrid is very, very Hard To Read and it will turn some readers off your story. You can still keep his dialect though, remember, even if you don't go Phonetic - "I'm off t' pub" is perfectly readable and understandable Hagrid-ey Dialect and still sounds like Hagrid. To me, at least. YMMV. :)

As far as French goes, I personally just have Fleur say 'arri' and ignore the rest of the pantomime French accent Rowling used, but if you're into it, try this:

Thinking about this thread I have actually decided that I really don't like the implied sneering at non-English-natives very much. Do you write Tonks (who is supposedly a bit Cockney) with missing Hs? Do you write people from the North with their accent? No, you don't, it is just non-natives you taunt.

No, actually it isn't just that, you make fun of how stupid Hagrid is as well. Nice, with big heart, but stupid ... so yes, his accent has to be spelled out.
