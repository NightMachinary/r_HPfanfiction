Yeah, what it says on the tin. I would stress that if Harry is gay it should be in a general way and not in a 'this pairing is destined' way. Like, he dates a few different guys and maybe doesn't end up with any of them. SIs are worth bonus points.

It's funny because I was just thinking about how dumb the Big-Dick!Harry trope is. Bitch have you ever talked to a woman? I straight up asked two of my female friends whether they would prefer length or girth over christmas. You know what they said? 'Neither'. Taking something too large inside your body is uncomfortable and not everyone is down for that. You know who do sometimes actually like really massive dongs? Quite a lot of gay men. (though I would point out my experience is anecdotal and is hardly guaranteed to be representative of women or men in whole or in more than a small part). Anyway, it would be awesome to see Harry in a dual gender harem or in an all male harem.

The fic need not contain lemon or any kind of smut. The MC's sexual orientation need not be a major plot point.

Anybody read something like that recently?

Edit: Found one - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12518394/1/The-Horcrux-s-Red-Head-Friend][The Horcrux's Red Head Friend]] - The SI is Ron and is gay.


** Only thing that comes to mind is linkffn(Second String), according to what I've read on this sub it's well-written and slash is planned later. The OC I've posted about is also gay, but it's unlikely to have any relevance (maybe possibly a bit at the end, but I definitely don't plan on fully tackling romance.)

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in the past, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort. A new perspective on the 1970s time travel genre. Updates weekly on Saturdays. Some slash much later.

** Writing pansexual Harry right now, but it's more of a background thingðŸ¤£

Am totally with you, though. It's always either smut or the main focus of the story. Can't sexuality be one aspect of a story, instead of being the defining thing? Looking forward to some recs

*** The problem is a matter of statistics. I've heard it reported that upward of 10% of the gen pop is non-straight, but I'm not sure those statistics are really reliable, and I've heard it reported elsewhere that the value might be as low as 1%. Personally I don't think anyone is actually 100% straight, finding true zero on the Kinsey scale would seem somewhat unlikely, but sexuality is an evolving thing which is different for every person. I like to think that in a few more decades we will have moved past really caring about a person's orientation, that it will become a secondary detail like what their favorite magic class is. As of now, I think M/M pairings are probably over represented, partly because of the glut of male characters in Harry Potter, and partly because maybe people are trying to over compensate for the previous cultural lack of gay ships? The problem likely stems more from the former though, because it means we get gay characters only in the context of Draco/Harry or Snape/Lucius or whatever. The characters might actually be gay, but maybe they are just being used to explore a particular ship (which is fine but not what I'd prefer) rather than being genuinely gay and then being set free in the context of the story to date whoever the course of events would naturally push them towards. Idk, maybe that's just bias from my own story writing method coming through.

I look forward to reading your story when you write it!

**** I think it's way more than 1%! Depends really, if you only use canon characters as possible partners, that's tough.

If you want a gay Harry, have fun, you just need to ask. You don't have to invent bizarre statistics.

**** My point was that you don't need to give a false argument (even if you admit it's a bad one) to ask for something you enjoy.
