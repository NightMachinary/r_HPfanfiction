I was checking to see if it caught on at least in this subreddit, when I saw a comment by Bleepblootbotz2 that it could refer to several straight romantic ships.

Do you agree that it is a vague name for a romantic pairing? I actually think it makes a lot of sense, that it could only refer to Harry/Fleur because Fleur does translate into flower in English.


** I thought it was Lily/James shipping, for Marauder-era fics. Because Flower (Lily) Pot (Potter).

Heck, it could be Neville/Potter shipping, because Neville's an ace at Herbology...

*** Agree. I've never seen it refer to any ship but James/Lily, but that might just be because I don't read Harry/Fleur.

**** Could be worse. Petunias are a kind of flower, and Pot could be short for *Pot*ions Professor.

...I think I did see a one-shot that made fun of that, once. Where was it...?

** Considering just how many women have floral-related names in the books, I'm surprised nobody's written a bunch of smutty one-shots featuring each of them in turn and titled it "Pottering around the Flower Bed".

*** James x Lily\\
James x Petunia (this is the real reason Petunia hates her sister)

Harry x Pansy\\
Harry x Fleur Harry x Lavender\\
Harry x Lily Moon Harry x Narcissa\\
Harry x Poppy Pomfrey

Lily Luna Potter x herself\\
Rose Weasley x Uncle Harry

There. That's almost every flower name paired with the most suitable Potter.

**** Given how somewhat common cousin pairings seem to be in the Wizarding World (and it's actually a thing IRL too in several countries), I figured Rose would be shipped with James II or Albus rather than Harry.

** Fleur, Lily, Petunia are all flowers (there are others as well, but I see them brought up very rarely in such context due to being far less obvious). Pot is obviously a Potter. So it can refer to Jily, Petunia/James (which I've actually seen more than once), Fleur/Harry. It can obviously also refer to cross-generational shipping in theory but that's far less plausible since Harry/anyone would be incest and Fleur/James requires James to still be alive.

I think it's generally used to refer to Fleur/Harry, though. I think Jily has a rather bizarre shipname in "Ginger Snaps", something I interpreted as something entirely different the first time I saw it...

** Well, I prefer not to use silly names (some are funny, I admit - but confusing! Why not just use the freaking names, as to not confuse other people! Hermione/Harry ("Harmony" - damned, who came up with that one! Especially since it would not be harmony! Hermione is pushy and bossy and Harry does occationally fight back against those tendencies of her's!) works just fine! Just like Harry/Ginny, Harry/Fleur, Harry/Daphne etc. etc.)
