I want to read fics where you can feel the ground rumble, the heavens crack and the air go thick with magic as people battle. It can be a duel between Harry and Voldemort, the battle of Hogwarts in it's entirety or something completely different.


** The Imposter Complex tries to satisfy the needs of epic magical battles.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13275002/1/The-Imposter-Complex]]

â€‹

Chapter 7 has Tom fighting a Demon and being saved by Flamel and Dumbledore.

Chapter 20 has Tom trying to assassinate a chinese Dark Lord.

Chapter 24 has a neat three-way duel between the Triwizard champions.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

** While it doesn't have any big battles like the latter half of canon (yet,) there's a scene in the second part of [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/series.php?seriesid=54][Meaning of One]] where a second year student with an unprecedented amount of raw magic power burns the entire acromantula colony in the forbidden forest with Bluebell Flames. You know, the fire that's /normally safe enough to hold in your hand./ Ended up being a full-on Aussie bushfire.

A lot of the fic focuses on the magically powerful students making sure they don't overpower their spells.

  When Harry's name comes out of the Goblet of Fire Dumbledore gives him a choice. Either participate in the tournament or lose his magic and leave Hogwarts. The Headmaster would never have guessed that Harry would lash out angrily and choose the latter. Minor Ron and Dumbledore bashing at the start. Wizarding War on a quicker timescale than in canon.

*** Gah I've never got through that one myself I always get upset about the beginning. By the time the author says his Core stops filling he should be way higher then what the author says he's at seeing as it was a steady gain from Halloween to the end up the school year. 1 point gained every 6 hours for 8 months. and when the author says he's stopped growing its considerably lower number then it should've been.

**** Half the time i see numbers or dates in a fic I just believe that the authors are just honoring canon especially since JKR herself has stated how horrible she is with numbers. And her calendars rarely correspond with the real world (would be really curious to know whether any editor ever caught it and mentioned it to her or why they left those discrepancies in)

One way to reconcile the delta (even though there is nothing explicitly in the fic to support it) is to assume that the steady rate held until he was 15-20% away from being filled. Then the rate slowed down. Otherwise he should have been at 960+ versus the 736 the author stopped him at. All we know was the one comparison prior to the goblet that said harry was near 180 possibly low 200's where harry states that would mean his core 41 reading should have been 1/5 (20%) of his core and the amount he could see his core was filled was nowhere near 1/5 full.

In that case we could assume his 41 was 1/20 (5%) of his core which would at least get us in the ballpark.

(Added after initial comment) Of course if I would run the numbers myself it seems the author decided that 41 was closer to 1/18 (5.5%) of Harry's core as that would be 738
