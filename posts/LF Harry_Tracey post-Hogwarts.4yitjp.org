Hi

I'm looking for fanfics (can be one shots or novel-lengths) that include Harry x Tracey post-Hogwarts. Tbh I don't even know if that exists but well maybe someone knows one. Thanks in advance

(edit : I just realized I didn't say it clearly but I'm looking for fanfics where the relationship begins post-Hogwarts)

(edit 2 : just realized i already "Modest, too" by Luan Mao, Tequila and that one where his house is attacked (can't remember the name atm) so if you have any besides these ones it would be nice)


** Just take a Harry/Daphne story and do a find+replace on Daphne for Tracey.

*********** And if you were to write stories about them the would be effectively OCs, because they had no character originally.

Let's try this: What is Canon Tracey's personality like?

Take all the time you need.

************ The difference is she has a personality; we just dont know it.

I feel like you're confused. Im not arguing if shes a blank slate, because she is but she is not an OC, which by the way stands for original character. The definition of original is "created directly and personally by a particular artist; not a copy or imitation" which means that Tracey is not an OC.

If you need more evidence just go to the ffn character list. Tracey Davis is listed as her own character. If she was an OC why would they list her name as well as an OC selection?

************* You're being pedantic. The line between blank slate canon character and fanon OC is thin to the point of invisibility. Or, as my dad likes to say, "a difference that makes no difference, is no difference." To the fandom, a canon blank slate is an OC in all but name, quite literally.

************** The sad (in my opinion) thing is that it does make a huge difference 'in the fandom'. If was to write a story with an OC called Mary Smith, chances are hardly anyone would read it. If I replaced Mary Smith with say, Marlene McKinnon or Sally-Anne Perks or for that matter Tracey Davis, it would probably get ten times as many reads. I see over and over again, people on here say they won't read OC stories because they are not 'invested' in OCs. Yet how can you possibly be invested in a character who /has/ no character?

***** Yeah I guess I should have said it better but I meant like she is a blank state (besides her being a Slytherin). Authors can describe her in any way they want

****** I don't think it's even canon that she's Slytherin. I think she's just a name that showed up in the 40 names Rowling showed on a special, and that she's a Slytherin and friend of Daphne is 100% fan-created.
