*** Why would you be disappointed to begin with? This is Fan FICTION. Its all about exploring the world and its possibilities, and at times going even further. And "slaves" and Muggle/Muggleborns being lesser "beings" than Purebloods are both already a part of HP cannon.

Just sayin ;)

*** Well, it's not slavery - the Patron system was installed after outright enslaving muggleborns was outlawed in the 16th century. And custom and peer pressure pose some limits on it. (And ironically, while most purebloods get emancipated once they are adults, the purebloods of the rich families usually don't get emancipated and live under the thumb of their head of family since that means they have access to the family fortune and get a shot at becoming head one day.)

But most important is that a main part of the story is the fight by both Harry and Hermione to change the entire system. It's not a "Hermione learns to be happy to be a third-class citizen" story.

#+begin_quote
  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** I have never seen a fic where Harry owns a slave... but in linkffn(better angels by lmk05), James Potter ends up owning Snape who is a slave. I highly recommend it.

Damn I just saw that your request said female slave... sorry. Requesting anyway in case anyone's interested.

  When James Potter rescues his rival from a slavery, he doesn't understand the responsibility he is taking on. Can a confused and resentful fifth year overcome his old animosity to help his former rival? Can an abused Snape accept his new role?

** I have on multiple occasions requested fics dealing with the concept of slavery in the wizarding world. Usually focusing on Muggle/muggleborn slavery, where for example Voldemort has taken over and its commonplace, or Harry buys female muggleborns (like Hermione) to save them, or even "Sex slave" associated ones.

Sadly I almost never get any responses because it seems as if people are just afraid to write about the subject. Slavery is after all, a touchy subject in the real world and likely hard to write. But its too bad in a fictional HP Wizarding world, it cant be explored further, especially as slavery IS a part of cannon.
