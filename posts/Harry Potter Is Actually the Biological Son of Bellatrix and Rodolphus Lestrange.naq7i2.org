In honor of my favorite (abandoned) fanfic, "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11594215/1/The-Curious-Case-of-Romulus-Lestrange][The Curious Case of Romulus Lestrange]]" by underthemoonandstars, I would like to see others try to take a crack at this highly interesting and underrated premise.

I only request that the identity reveal takes place at some point in Harry's fifth year.


** Oohh, I loved this one. Sadly I've never come across any other (noteworthy and/or well written) fanfic like it. One can only hope that one day a good writer will write a similar story.

*** Agreed. Never before or since have I encountered an author who could so realistically communicate such an "absurd" subject. They wrote that story so well, that I could actually see it as easily being a part of that universe. I was so disappointed when I realized it was abandoned.

*** Linkffn(Corvus black) it's decent but drags a bit. Also unfinished. Harry is Snape and bellatrix's son

  What could be worse than a nightmare? Waking up to discover that it was reality, of course. But after finding out Bellatrix was his mother, discovering that the Death Eater who fathered him was Severus Snape almost came as a relief. Deciding to take up his real identity was easy enough ... actually living it, not so much. AU: After fifth year. Sevitus with a twist.

** The only good one that I read for now that wasn't abandoned is The Parseltongue Twins on AO3. It's really a shame there aren't more fics with this premise.

** I actually started writing this one, back when I was in primary school, or early high school. I've been planning to pull it and rewrite it for ages, since I only got a few chapters in, and it was incredibly, incredibly rough.
