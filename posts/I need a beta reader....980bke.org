I've been working on a fanfiction for a week now. It is finally coming around. I'd say I've written around 25% of the first chapter. I need someone to look at it, and give me some pointers. I've posted it over AO3. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15574542][You can read it here.]] Have mercy on me though, I've only just begun writing for the first time in my life.


** So i'm going to give you my thoughts while reading:

‘It was cruel of Harry', Dumbledore would say. Harry couldn't care less. Finally, it came; the day he left the Dursley's.

/Harry imagines dubmle dumbledore would call it cruel but he didnt care. (this sentence should be part of the alinea above it as it connects with that not with this alinea)/

Levitating his trunk wandlessly downstairs, he saw that Dudley was struggling with Aunt Petunia over food. It was quite funny to Harry.

/He is carrying his truck no magic for 14 yr olds not in school/

“Leaving. I'll see you next summer.” replied Harry coolly, before opening the front door and stepping outside.

/You speak of a Harry of dumbledore like intelligence. When someone is that intelligent why do you have him rely on fear in his relationship with the durseleys? (installing fear with magic is illegal in canon btw) But its also not an intelligent way to solve the problem. It's the way a lot of independent harry writers have badass harry solve his problem after years of abuse./

/As i understand it your Harry always was intelligent so please have him respond to others in an intelligent fashion./

Arriving at the Leaky Cauldron on Charing Cross road in western London, Harry paid his fare and got off the Knight bus. His trunk was already on the curb. He looked back, the bus had left.

/There is a lot of tell not much show.. Try to take the reader along with harry instead of telling us what harry is doing. Tell us what harry sees feels etcetera instead of from an outside perspective./

‘Dumbledore has someone watching me this summer' intuitively thought Harry. He'd had to be careful about not getting caught by the spy doing something wrong and would have to lose him before entering Knockturn alley.

/Harry isnt thinking that intuitively he simply knows it because Tom basically tells him. Which would be incredibly stupid of dumbledore to do unless he wanted Harry to know? (there is no upside in letting Tom know harry is coming....)/

“Of course, my boy. Your old room is available; and perhaps a bit of breakfast?” asked Tom politely with a smile, that was missing a few teeth. Scary!

/He is 14 he has an old room. He should have seen the teeth before so no reason to think scary. Stay consistent in your universe./

Harry took the key Tom gave him and took the stairs upstairs, his trunk levitating behind him.

/Again no levitation/

He took a survey of the room and slid his trunk under the bed after casting a few alarm and security spells on it. There were some questionable items in his trunk so precautions were a necessity with a spy on his tale.

/Is he serious about Dumbles spyin on him? Because if Dumbles is those spells will have zero effect dumbles just goes in does whatever the fuck he wants and gets out. No 14 yr old would know. Be consisent in universe evena smart/intelligent 14 yr old doesnt stand a chance against Dumbles. Or is dumbles an idiot in the story (Dumbles did basically tell harry he was spying after all)?/

He hadn't eaten anything since dinner last night in a hurry to get away from the Dursley's.

/What hurry? He explicitly waited an extra week while not being totally neccasery?/

He sat ahead and acted calm. After half an hour, the Hampstead station came, but Harry sat still.

/Acted calm? For all we know he is calm? You didnt show any nervs?/

Harry got out of the tube station and discreetly summoned the Knight bus again. Entering the Leaky Cauldron again, he saw that Tom was missing. ‘Probably had gone to help that woman back to Diagon alley', he intuitively reasoned.

/So he ditched the spy for no reason? He goes back to the place he was before so the spy now is back. There is no logic to this action./

/Why would Tom help her back? She can just apparte out of sight? There is no reason for tom to do anything..../

Harry decided to visit Knockturn alley first after a visit to his vault, then do his school shopping later.

/Harry is now again tailed by a spy because there is no reason at all for there not being a spy. (or is Dumbles indeed an idiot)/

He had also asked the goblins, to transfer the Basilisk skin to the French branch of Gringotts in Paris today.

/The second year one? You will have to give some context of how this got out of the school?/

He'd thought of selling it, but then decided against it. It was a trophy. “Trophies aren't sold”, Dumbledore had said.

/And finding it on another persons property doesnt make you the owner. So there is no selling./

Harvesting the thousand foot long Basilisk had taken nearly six months, and also provided Harry with a massive increase to his vault and with a good amount of Basilisk skin. Dumbledore, Snape and Sprout had called experts they knew who could get the job done. Many Magizoologists, Potioneers had come. A thousand year old Basilisk was nearly a miracle and many wanted to see it.

/Cool there is the explanition I was waiting for. Of course the basilisk is property of the school so harry wouldnt get the money...../

Hayato Kang who Harry automatically decided to call Sensei when he first met him in January, c.1993 was a tall man, he was lean but not thin.

/You can't use a Katana is remotely the same way as a western Sword. So or the Japanese Sword master wearing a katana is acutally also an expert on western weapons? Or Harry is not going to learn how to use a western sword? (your choice)/

‘How did Dumbledore put up blood wards on Number 4, Privet Drive if they have been outlawed for over 300 years?' wondered Harry.

/If harry already knew they were outlawed why is he wondering this now? Not when he found out?/

In Hogwarts Harry had claimed a large classroom on the seventh floor and locked it with a password and additional wards.

/This is quite the time jump you make here? Maybe add something about the journey or what he did for the rest of the vacation?/

The cupboard had to be fixed. He'd called Dobby and asked him to fix the cupboard for him. Dobby had gone and gotten 2 more elves.

/If dumbledore isn't supposed to know things like this? He certainly knows now his elves did it./

Tom was annoyed with him. He ordered a roasted lamb with gravy, along with an ice cream sundae for dese

/So he isnt at hogwarts? Now i'm confused./

*** Overall i think the story has potential. Your writing style is very telling still. So that's something to work on.

Think about how 14 yr olds act and think. Don't make Harry to grown up.

And some of your sentence structure may require some adjustment.

** I gave it a try. Sorry wandless magic is an absolute no go. It makes even the best stories incrediby dull to read.

The premise of strating in 4th year jumping into the story i like! So good luck i hope others will enjoy it!

**** What wandless magic do we see Dumbledore do in the books? (in the movies we see the man changing some banners but that could be the house elves just as well) And even if he is able to do it in his old age we 14 is still rather young.

But i will explain to you why it makes stories dull. It for some reason is always untracable and not tracked by the ministery (altough the Trace is not on the wand) so the whole magic system from canon goes out of the door and Harry can do whatever he likes. It is boring

****** The trace records all the magic around a minor. Doesnt matter who casts it. That's how the minesterie tracks dobbies levitation spell in book 2.

In magical places and households the miniterie assumes all magic is done by the adults and adults keep minors in check.

************ The trace is on Harry as a person. Not on his wand.

All magic used near a minor is traced. Not only the magic performed with a minors wand.

In book 2 the levitation spell Dobby uses is traced by the ministery because it was used in Harries presence.

In magical households the minitery does not send letters with warnings because they assume the parents not the childeren are using magic when the trace goes of in a magical location.

** After living with the Dursley[']s (you don't want the apostrophe. At the Dursley's would since you're talking about the home they possess but the Dursleys are people, multiple people and therefore plural.) for 2 weeks, Harry had felt the blood wards, built by Dumbledore 13 years ago fully recovered. (Whole sentence is clunky, that whole sentence needs to be re-written.) Though just [for]->(to) be[ing]->(cut) on the safe side he['d->had](You shrink speech to match what would be really said, you don't do it for your writing.) decided to spend a week more there. Enduring the Dursley's for three weeks had gotten a whole lot easier, when he had used a [wandless](oh dear.) stinging spell on Dudley in full view of both Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia his first day on Privet Drive.

So your first line has a mistake. The rest of the paragraph doesn't get better and you've already introduced wandless magic which is making me nope out of there. Wands are important in HP magic. An OP indy Harry will probably get more attention on FFnet than here. Have you considered looking for a beta on their forums?

**** I can't help you. From what I've seen of your fic I would want to change everything, plot, characters and all, at that point you're not writing your own story.I dislike your MC, I dislike the tone, I dislike the wandless bullshit, I dislike the way you're presenting Dumbledore, and I can't help but feel I've read a 5th year version of this a dozen times. This isn't a story I could help with.
