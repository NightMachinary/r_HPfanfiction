Is this even allowable? Not sure what the legal/moral implications are for this

Edit: I only ask because there's such a woeful/frequent occurrence of discarded unfinished FF


** I've actually contemplated creating an account on FF.net called "The Finisher" that does nothing but finish abandoned works. If I did that I would try to get permission where I could, but unless an author specifically forbade me from doing it I would do it anyway.

** Well, such "recursive fanfiction" is popular enough to have [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecursiveFanfiction][its own trope page]]. There are already a zillion people writing continuations of /HPMoR/, for example, and I don't /think/ the author gave explicit permission to all those people. I don't see much difference between continuing a /complete/ story and continuing an /incomplete/ story.

*** The author said he doesn't mind if people play with his creation, it was a blanket permission so he doesn't need each of them to seek permission individually.

** I've seen it done with permission before, It's probably allowed to be done without it if you want, you don't need permission from authors to write fanfiction after all, so it probably applies to fanfiction of fanfiction or continuations. People will most likely complain at you in reviews though.

**** Yeah- I remember reading the start of Harry Potter and the New Life, but I never finished it, because whenever I came back to continue reading it I would always accidentally read another fanfic with the same name- albeit with the same characters, and so on, but subtly different.

As well as this, I think there were also continuations of "Vox Corporis" and "Coming Back Late", but I've never actually read them.

To be honest, I'm surprised there haven't been any continuations of Lori's Paradigm of Uncertainty trilogy, since it ended on something of a cliffhanger.

****** It is, yes, which makes the continuation seem even more puzzling. It's a hefty 310,000 words, as well, which is almost as long as the original. Here's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3623347/1/VOX-CORPORIS-Rebirth][a link]].

*** Can someone explain to me why /that/ fic got continued so many bloody times? Nothing against it, a few of the continuations have been really entertaining... I just don't understand why it got picked up so many times when other abandoned works haven't been.

** Not a lawyer.

This is a legal grey area. US copyright of derivative works only applies to lawful derivative works. While Rowling has approved of non-commercial fan fiction, that isn't necessarily the same as a proper license to create a derivative work. If a court says it's not, then Harry Potter fan fiction enjoys no copyright protection (aside from using elements from Rowling's fictional world, which are covered in her copyrights). Other fandoms with no explicit authorial blessings for fan fiction are much less of a grey area -- you've got zero protections.

I've heard stories of authors writing fan fiction, then going to a bookstore and finding a book for sale that's essentially their work with all the character names changed. Spoke to a lawyer; nothing they could do about it unless they got the original work's publisher to join in the lawsuit.

** I think it is 100% okay if someone wants to do an unofficial sequel or an AU or a continuation of a fic, permission or not. It's like fanfic of fanfic... And fanfic is permitted so why not fan fiction of fan fictions? I don't know the policy of FF.net, but AO3 would only remove it if there was plagiarism involved. If the continuation is all your own work, then it is no different then any other fanfic.

Now, I'd suggest you try to get permission first, as that's kind of a nice thing to do, and may prevent wank down the line, but it's no more needed then asking JKR for permission to write your Steampunk Harem Harry fic.
