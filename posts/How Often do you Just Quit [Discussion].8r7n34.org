The more stories I read, the faster I feel like I drop stories that annoy me even a little bit. Mainly it's when the romance is utterly stupid and drawn out via melodrama ("Oh really, Hermione gets with Draco because Harry/Ron randomly decided to sleep with some random lady at an inopportune time? Because of course they did") or when I'm made to try and sympathize with a prick of a character ("We, the Dursleys, are actually good normal people. Oh Harry, it's only your freakishness that makes us treat you with a firm hand"). Out of the last 20 or so stories I've read on the FFN app, I've dropped all but two or so, and within the first couple of chapters (and with a, er, terse review) and I wonder if it's just impatience. I've read enough stories that don't do that crap and don't have awful pacing that slow burns and excessive length just bore me.

I think that's why I've been really into one/two/three shots lately. Less chance of that bs and - although I like a nicely developed world - I don't feel like I've lost a bunch of time if I don't enjoy it.

Confession: I was just reading a romance that, after nine of the thirty-nine chapters, had this happen (or obviously set up to happen). A quick glance at the comments let me know this was indeed what would happen for the next ten or so chapters and I quit in annoyance because fuck that noise.

I honestly only have like one Fallout fic saved, and it's not a crossover or anything. It's a Fallout 4 story, and I personally found it absolutely hilarious. Though it might not be for everyone.

** Poor writing style will make me drop a story really fast. It bugs me tremendously when a story can be good, but the author decided to write one paragraph with three different people speaking in it. Shit like that makes it hard to keep track of what's going on.

Or when people write multiple PoVs within one section of a story.

Like:

/Harry walked into the living room at Grimmauld Place to deathly silence, he wasn't aware of anything he'd done, but when he looked at Ron, he knew something was up./

/Ron, meanwhile, was furious with his so-called best friend, how dare he.../

God, it annoys me so much. If you write a part of your story, please please /please/ write it from one person's point of view!

** It's a combination of pickiness concerning headcanon and preferred fanon, high standards, and just plain burnout. This is what I'm going through now. I have dropped multiple fics that I have previously enjoyed because that last chapter just rubbed me the wrong way in some small manner and I just didn't care enough to continue. Now only crossovers and [[/r/HFY]] are enough to interest me. Everything else is just bloody stale or not to my taste.

It doesn't help that almost every author can't follow a schedule. That itself isn't a huge problem, but if they don't turn each chapter into a proper serial fic that constantly re-engages my interest, instead slowly putting out something that is meant to be read all in one go, it really turns me off of what I'm reading.

In the past six years of writing the story they're only 20 chapters in a planned 60 chapter story. It doesn't help that whenever they update, it's just a filler chapter with no purpose in furthering the plot.

** One thing I've noticed that is pissing me off more and more, is Harry coming to the realisation over summer, that he just loves flying, he actually hates quidditch. He then proceeds, as a 13/14 y/o boy, entirely of his own volition, to go to his Head of House, the Headmaster, all other teachers, and probably sends a message to Rolf Harris, saying that his studies are far too important, and he would be dropping out of the quidditch team forthwith, as its "the mature thing to do"

It just comes across as poor writing.. I get some people hate quidditch because it's broken etc, but at least be creative in how you drop it, don't repeat the same tired ideas. This is what led to me dropping a few of my last stories I tried to read

But... the story isn't about how Harry decided to drop Quidditch and the intricacies of that decision. It would be stupid to write a whole complex story arc about a topic that is not relevant to the story. Him just deciding to not do it anymore is a decent way to get the topic out of the way.

Same with stories where Harry stops being friends with Ron. For some reason some people expect these stories to have a deep and complex analysis of Ron and his friendship with Harry, which would be the opposite of the original purpose.

There are quite a few points where you can drop the Ron friendship without too much drama and still keep Harry and Ron in character (so no secret Death Eater plots or similar stupidity)

1. Ron's celebrity awe on the Hogwarts Express making Harry uncomfortable.

2. The Troll incident, or more accurately Ron making Hermione cry. Not that Harry would throw a fit or anything, but it could make him very uncomfortable (Am I becoming Dudley?)

3. Ron's treatment of Hermione over Scabbers. Had he been right, his behaviour would have been perfectly justified. But as a matter of fact Crookshanks did not eat Pettigrew and therefore he spent 9 months falsely accusing Harry's friend (and never apologised on screen). Fairly easy to write the end of their friendship there.

4. Ron's fit over the Goblet. Trust is perhaps the most difficult thing to rebuild and it would not be out of character for Harry to not be as forgiving as in canon. He holds his grudge over Stan surprisingly long.

5. Lavender. I mean, I am pretty sure that most teenage boys, my past-self included, would rather spend some quality time with their 10/10 girlfriend than worry about death and destruction. The trio drifting apart because Ron, like most of us, thinks with his lower head wouldn't be too difficult to sell.

6. The Horcrux-induced flight. Ron never finds them, broken trust cannot be regained, Harry doesn't take Ron back without the life-saving event, Ron gets caught and/or killed... Take your pick, there's plenty to choose from.

** I only quit reading if I find the conflic to just be drawn out melodrama. Like I was reading this Hermione/Riddle fic and it was kinda silly how the author kept using (rather abusive) plot points just to further the relationship. I'll usually skip to the last few chapters for the happy ending.

Also, for slowburn fics I just quit when the UST is resolved through a love scene. It just doesn't seem interesting to read about how the relationship will end especially if I know it's a happy ending.

Similar to OP, I prefer reading (and writing) 1,2,3 shots. I'm more of a short story / poetry person myself and I find that the shorter the story, the bigger the challenge to flesh out a compelling plot and character. Usually the writing's better too.

  dark wizards can't cast a Patronus.

Snape could.

Here is a quote from Pottermore about dark wizards casting Patronus:

#+begin_quote
  In spite of a long association with those fighting for lofty or noble causes (those able to produce corporeal Patronuses were often elected to high office within the Wizengamot and Ministry of Magic), the Patronus is not unknown among Dark wizards. While there is a widespread and justified belief that a wizard who is not pure of heart cannot produce a successful Patronus (the most famous example of the spell backfiring is that of the Dark wizard Raczidian, who was devoured by maggots), a rare few witches and wizards of questionable morals have succeeded in producing the Charm (Dolores Umbridge, for example, is able to conjure a cat Patronus to protect herself from Dementors). It may be that a true and confident belief in the rightness of one's actions can supply the necessary happiness. However, most such men and women, who become desensitised to the effects of the Dark creatures with whom they may ally themselves, regard the Patronus as an unnecessary spell to have in their arsenal.

Also, I have certain tropes or characters that are too OOC without significant changes to canon that will get me to drop a fic.

*** Noted, but there is a difference between "not my cuppa tea" and "not even a hot cup of tea."

If it is written poorly, then leaving a terse review is up to the perogative of the reader. In [[/u/MindForgedManacle]] 's case, it seems they most likely mean poorly done cliches or overused cliches. Or romances that are not romances.

Up to the reader, then. We could go all day over "terseness" and intention, but then if I get a terse review and stew over it for days in a depressed slump, then I need to learn to stick it to my readers and write *my story*.

I read one such story where the writer continuously got flak for the amount of smut in their story. Their response, succinctly, was to /write more smut/. It was hilarious, and consequently not my cuppa tea, but I enjoyed their attitude.

Don't fret the small things. If you do, refer back to my previous sentence. At the same time, if a small thing is "you make your charachters sound dry and cutout" - and they really are, then you have choices. Listen and ignore them.

No, it isn't. Just telling someone you don't like A or B is in no way constructive or helpful because they will probably have another review telling them how much they like A or B. Expressing your preferences is not constructive criticism because it is about /you/ and not about the writing. Telling someone how and why you came to have that preference in their work /is/ useful because it can help the writer decide if they are reaching their desired audience or not.
