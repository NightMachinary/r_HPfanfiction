There are lots of fics that have Harry (with some pompous pureblood name instead) raised by dark wizards or by Voldemort himself. I'm not really interested in that because usually it's like there's nothing left of canon Harry, and I just can't get interested in OC's.

What about Harry raised by the Dursleys, going to Hogwarts, and somewhere along the line honestly converted to pureblood supremacy? I would really like to read something along those lines that's believable. The closest I've found was Harry turning dark but using his violence to avenge or defend his canon allies.


** Lady Khali's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][The Well Groomed Mind]] is one where Harry joins Riddle on his own terms. 183k words, abandoned (though there's still a good amount to read).

#+begin_quote
  On Halloween 1994, Harry learns his mind isn't his own. On Samhain morn, he vows to question everything. Armed with logic and an unlikely ally, Harry makes a last ditch bid to reclaim his life. The goal: survive at all costs.

*** Actually, if you go to the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1509740/Lady-Khali][author's page]] she updated it a few days ago with the reason for her absence, and saying that she's going to start updating again. There's hope yet!

*** I think I did read this a long time ago, but I forgot it enough that I'm able to enjoy it a lot this time! The genetics angle is pretty original, from what I've seen. Looking forward to an update now that it's no longer on hiatus!

** One definite answer is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][/The Well Groomed Mind/,]] already recommended by truncation_error.

Another, but less relevant one, is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness][/On the Way to Greatness/.]] Here, Harry starts digging into Voldemort's ideology and propaganda and even takes into consideration (AFAIR) some of the things that Tom was\is trying to say (doesn't join him though).

There is also /HP & Descent into Darkness/, but I'd recommend against it because of its gradual deterioration. Its characters lose their resemblance to their original selves by each following chapter, the story becomes almost completely concentrated on romance and smut, etc.

*** I'm really enjoying The Well-Groomed Mind, and I've already read On the Way to Greatness and enjoyed it. I've tried at least twice to read Descent into Darkness, but something always made me stop. I agree.
