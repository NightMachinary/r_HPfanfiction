I started reading and really enjoying fanfics where Harry has a mentor. So much to see Harry receive all the love and affection from a mother or father that he deserves.

The main ones usually have Snape adopting Harry as his pupil. Rescuing him from the home of his abusive relatives, etc. (I already got sick of these.)

Recently browsing the FFN I found a fanfic that interested me a lot, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11650059/1/The-Sinistra-Ward][The Sinistra Ward]]. Where Aurora Sinistra ends up looking for Harry under Professor McGonagall, and ends up tracking him in a store. Where Harry worked. When she goes to the ministry looking for papers about Harry's magical guardian, she finds out that the magic has made her Harry's guardian. And so the bond between the two begins to form.

I really think these fanfics are really cool, I'll give you some examples, in case you are interested and want to read

.- The accidental animagus. (Granger family.)

- Harry McGonagall. (Professor McGonagall's nephews)

- An Inconvenient Truth (Amelia Bones)

- Harry Potter and the Rule of three. (Amelia Bones)

- Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path (Babbling)

If you know others, feel free to add them in the comments!


** I'd honestly like to see more fics where Harry gets adopted outright by the Weasleys

*** /Like A Red Headed Step-child/ was great, if a bit cracky.

** One of my favorite adopted Harry fanfics has him actually adopted by a muggle OC who found toddler Harry wandering around in the night he had been dropped off on a certain doorstep

There's just some special charm to tiny magicals wielding kitchen utensils, having learned this particular skill from a muggle raising one of them.

** Would you be able to link the stories? The ones you mentioned seem interesting but are hard to find on mobile

** I enjoy mentor stories, too, but I tend to stay away from adoption stories. Harry never acts his age and there's a lot of spanking, especially in Severitus.

I think what bothers me the most is how easily Dumbledore is outmaneuvered. I dislike the trope and the bashing, but Dumbledore very much controls who Harry meets. It's so unrealistic to me that a set of muggles or a Black can just grab him. Incidentally, my favorite adopted Harry fic is Resonance by greengecko. Snape has Dumbledore's permission, Dumbledore also dies, and Harry acts his age.

The Malfoys loving Harry like a son while also keeping their canon ideals is an unexplored area I've tried toyed with.

*** I would argue it's somewhat believable for black to outmaneuver dumbledore. He's known him practically his whole life, and has worked together closely with him in the order. And while /most/ fics have sirius as care free and irresponsible, black is still deffinetly an intelligent character and if a writer chose to make him more serious and competent following the events of james and lilys death, it really wouldn't be a stretch to see him out maneuver dumbledore in regards to harry.

For example, the harry black series did this quite well

**** Sirius is intelligent, but he's 22, or nearly so, it would be a little ridiculous for him to work a 90 something year old politician, especially one as powerful. Scrimgeour and Fudge tell us Dumbledore kept them from Harry post OotP and /they/ were Ministers.

I also think you're giving his relationship with and knowledge of Dumbledore a little too much. He knows of him as any former student knows their Headmaster, but he doesn't work closely with Dumbledore or know him in the same way Harry, and Snape to any extent, do.
