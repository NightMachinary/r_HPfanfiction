So, I'm working on a story, temporarily titled /All is Well/ (I might rename it later), where I show what else could right itself post-epilogue so that all, literally all, is well in the world of Harry Potter. I have lots of ideas. Rational use of the Resurrection Stone will be implemented (rather than let any one person use it, it will be state-controlled, and used #1 to get a picture of the Afterlife and tell people what to expect, and #2 to solve unsolved murders, organize the inheritance of people who never wrote a will, etc.). Elves will be freed. The Statute of Secrecy will eventually be destroyed.

My point is, one big part is that I am going to show all sentient species finally getting along, and the more savage ones being civilized. I have a pretty good idea of how I'll handle Dementors and Acromantulas. However, there are quite a few whom I don't really know how to handle yet, mostly due to lack of information in canon: Trolls, Merpeople, Hags, Vampires, Sphinxes, Manticores... Do you have any ideas (or knowledge of preexisting stories about them)?

Also, by the by, I have searched high and lo but could not find any decent Good!Acromantulas stories. There are a couple of Dementor-focused ones, but Acromantulas? Naught. Did I miss any?


** If it's not in the [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page][Harry Potter Wiki]] then generally neither

- Books
- Pottermore
- The fantastic beast movie script
- Cursed child
- Interviews
- Tweets
- The fantastic beast movie
- The other movies
- The games

gave any information about a subject. The Wiki is rather complete to my knowledge, I haven't found any trivia that wasn't at least referenced there (except for shortly after the release of the FB movie, but that was rectified quickly).

Then the next way to go is: "What legends exist around these things?" and then just adjust them to fit your story.

*** Yes... But in the case of Sphinxes, for instance, there are no legends about them as a /species/. The only legends with Sphinxes have them either be creations of gods rather than a true animal species (Assyrian mythology), or they only mention one solitary Sphinx (as in Greek mythology).

**** There is the saying "In every legend is a sparkle of truth". They are often portrayed as guardians and asking riddles, and that is how Rowling used them. What other properties do they have in the myths? As you mentioned, made by gods. Also, they have huge statues in Egypt.

I'll make an example, it's not be perfect, but it's what I came up with after 10 minutes of research:

#+begin_quote
  In the modern day no one is quite sure where the Sphinx come from, but most scholars agree that the Sphinx is native to Egypt. Egypt was only really populated with Wizards during the time of Pharaohs (the first Egypt wizards) so little record exists - it is known that before the pharaohs they were the strongest creature around (magical or not). Though generally peaceful, ancient wizards were only barely a match to the strength of a provoked sphinx'. Indeed, Ilaran, secondborn son of a Pharaoh is recorded noting that he'd "rather be locked in his father's pyramid than facing another one of /these/". This strength lead the them having an almost royal status and getting their own monuments in front of the pyramids as a sign of goodwill and peace.

  Indeed the legend of the Sphinx' made it's way all the way south to India, where they were confused with Cows - the real reason why the Cow is holy in India. Modern Sphinx claim to find this story funny, yet Cow has been on of their favorite desserts since they heard about it.

  The average Sphinx has a lifespan of a few hundred years, and being very content creatures they had little problems with the statue of secrecy. As long as they are near other beings and can guard something and ask riddles they have little needs, and readily admit this themselves. While Sphinx are undoubtedly fond of Riddles they also love jokes and puns, and if in the mood, can give valuable insight.
#+end_quote

So I kept the "Riddle" and "Guardian" part, took something completely unrelated from culture (Cows in India) made up that the Pharaohs were the first wizards (which isn't that improbable for all we know) and gave a reason for the monumental statues of the Sphinx (its for that day incredible strength). Simply try to give it /personality/ - that is what Rowling did with everything in the magical world and it worked quite well. (See: Flying Memos in the Ministry, Chocolate Frogs, Hippogriffs being proud)

** Acromantulas are tricky. While certainly of human intelligence, they are unmistakably predators, much higher on the food chain, and have murderous instincts. Aragog was tame for lack of a better word, because he was raised by humans from birth. Any other Acromantulas would be hostile and indeed try to eat Wizards.

Hags require some restrictions. (Headcanon) they are magical humanoids who can practice blood magic, sympathetic magic, and old magic in that they can lay down curses, blight crops and work weather. They eat human flesh, both for magical power and to increase their lifespan, and it must be regular. The ministry has laws against eating wizards, but muggles are fair game as long the hags aren't caught. Notable examples include the villains of Grimm's fairy tales, such as the witch from Hansel and Gretel, and the witch from Rapunzel.

Vampires are easy. They have some magical talents such as hypnosis, and extra physical abilities, but they generally keep to themselves and are under rules similar to hags. Wizards in a fight with a vampire will almost always win, except in the case of being surprised.

Dementors are super difficult, because they are amortal. They can't be killed, and live ridiculously long. They employ empathetic magic to feed on sentience, and can steal souls. While they can be bargained with, there isn't much to offer them, and they can't exactly be threatened. The only way found to kill them is by using a Necromancer, or freezing the Dementor solid, and physically carrying them to the ministry to push them through the Veil.

Sphinxes are pretty easy. They are of human intelligence, and while carnivorous, don't need to hunt humans exclusively. I could easily see treaties made with Sphinx clans to hire some out to guard treasure for example.

*** Thank you for a very complete answer. I'll answer point by point:

- Acromantulas. My line of thinking was to have the eldest son of Aragog (whom I call Belobog) take control of the Acromantula colony after the death of Mosag in the Battle of Hogwarts. Using the vast numbers of Acromantula deaths in the Battle, he makes them see they cannot keep living like savages and yet hope to face wizards successfully; he builds them into a civlization, regaining contact with Hagrid, who is all too happy to help, and Luna, who doesn't see anything problematic about this. Bottom line, I think of them as basically primitive humans who aren't born man-eating, but tend to blindly follow their instincts because they're not civilized at all.

- I like your ideas on Hags, but I'm not sure they work with canon. I recall there was a Society for the Reformation of Hags. How could such a thing exist if Hags literally need human flesh to survive? And I was wondering how you'd suppose Hag society was set up.

- Again, your answer on Vampires doesn't really answer my question. What do you think vampires are like? How do they live? How could they be made to reform and become a part of wizarding society? (Also, do you think that HP vampires are cursed like in old legends, or a separate species?)

- Dementors: as I said, I already have plans for those. I'm counting on education. Dementors need emotions, but they don't have to eat souls to survive. I'm thinking of 'civilized' Dementors, who survive through blood-bank-style organizations where people are paid to sit in the presence of a Dementor for half an hour, allowing them to feed on their momentary happiness.

- Sphinxes and Manticores... you precisely touch on the subject I was thinking of. How do you think their populations are set up? Do they live in clans, solitary, etc? Do they have their own languages? Etc.

Also, you didn't say anything about trolls and Merpeople.

**** I'm not gonna tell you how to write your fic, but there is something I wanted to say about Dementors. Dementors bothered me for the longest time, and it wasn't until not long ago that I figured out why. Consider this:

- The Dementors on the train gravitate towards Harry because of his bad memories? Not towards a group of happy kids?

- Dementors feed on good thoughts, but the only defense against them...is good thoughts?

- Dementors are used as Azkaban guards, despite the fact that there's no happiness in Azkaban to speak of?

What we're told about Dementors is /completely/ at odds with what we actually see from them. I don't know if this is nonsensical writing on Rowling's part, or an in-universe misunderstanding, but the available facts of Dementors simply do not add up.

***** My explanation would be that Dementors in Canon/want/ to cause unhappiness. They achieve this in normal people by sucking out good memories, but it's easier for them to do so on a person who's already pretty depressed, like Harry.

**** Dementors could be used as a method of practical defence of the mind, control of emotions, facing fear in a controlled environment, and bringing up buried memories (Lily's death seen by Harry).

** If you're going for rational use of the Stone, I think the most likely answer is to leave it lost in the forest.

Either it's a dangerous artifact created by a powerful wizard who killed himself after seeing false images of loved ones. The images were merely reconstructions of his memory. Legend around it grew, and it was falsely labeled a stone of resurrection.

Or it's an actual gift from Death, a tricky trap meant to guide people to their deaths. A being like Death would be very aware that seeing dead loved ones plays havoc on reasoning and emotion; I suspect the stone's effect would be similar to the Mirror of Erised's, depriving the user of any other desire. The only positive use for it in canon is to help Harry, Master of Death, become a sacrifice and not lose his will on the way to Voldemort. All other times it was used, Death claimed the user.

In both cases, the Stone seems very dangerous without deviating away from canon. And I think that's fitting. Magic is magic; it's fantastical and sometimes dark. Even if everyday lives are "solved" and "all is well", wouldn't there still be corner cases and deep mysteries to keep things fun?

*** There's a third possibility, which is the one I'm thinking of --- it was built by Cadmus Peverell rather than given by Death, but it actually summons souls of the dead, not reconstructions. At any rate, my point is precisely to use it to summon /other/ people than loved ones. To have it used by an organization rather than by a specific person.

** Trolls dont seem to be much smarter than the dumbest humans if you want to include them as getting along with other beings you would have to increase their intelligence or put them under the effects of caliming draught basically all the time vampires in harry potter seem to be a seperate speciese because they can breed with humans and produce half vampires, dont seem to get much older than wizards( in a videogame two vampires are listed as dying at around 200).There are also sweets that tasted like blood in Honeydukes for vampires so its entirely possible that vampires dont need blood to survive but merely have a liking for the taste. So its easy to supply them with blood of willing donators and generally produce more blood tasting food.

You could do the same with hags that they simply like the taste of raw meat like werewolves do and favor the taste of human children but not every hag has to eat humans like not every werewolf hast to be like Greyback and eat humans. For their powers I wouldn't give them many powers they could use without a wand, mostly first year Charms and being good and Herbology and Potions. I think Merpeople do already get allong with wizards but have problems comucating with wizards on land because of their biology and the lack of wizards who learn their language. So you could just say a new potion or enchanted object was created that allows them to talk human languages outside of water.

**** Having them use Ravenclaw's Diadem would be a little hard considering it was lost for a millennia until tom riddle found it and turned into a horcrux. after wards it was hidden for decades and destroyed at the end. There would be almost no chance for it to be researched. But if you wanted you could have the wizarding world discover diaries and books from Rowena Ravenclaw that could have a description of the enchanting of it
