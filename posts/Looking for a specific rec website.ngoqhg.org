While ago someone posted a website they made on here that helped with recommendations. You would put in the URL of a fanfiction you liked and it would spit out a page or so of fanfictions that matched up on tropes or whatever was similar. Does anyone remember this website?

or you could do this with Socrates bot on my discord, it's essentially the same thing:
