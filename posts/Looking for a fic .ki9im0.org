:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I am looking for a fic that I saw in fanfiction that is about harry going back in time with the golden trio. (Death gives harry a chance and hermione and ron tag along because they won't let harry be alone)

They go to first year and are sorted in slytherin. ( I think they called them the silver trio)

There is also info about harry subsconciously blocking his special abilities because he wanted to be normal. And him being assaulted by Vernon in the past.

I think harry is also lord hogwarts and he ron and hermione are animagus harry having multiple forms but playing with hermione and ron as wolves.

They also rescue sirius and imprison peter.

And ron is abused by molly later on because he is in slytherin and harry takes him in and adopts ron as his brother to the potter family

That's all I remember :c I can't find it!


** Sounds really good. Hope ya find it!
