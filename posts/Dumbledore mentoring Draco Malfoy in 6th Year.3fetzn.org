As a young man Dumbledore wanted to rule over muggles and ended up paying a price for those beliefs, and in 6th year Draco is in a sort of similar situation, and even if the specifics of it are very different, perhaps Dumbledore would have seen a bit of himself inside him?

So, are any fics where Dumbledore actively tries to mentor Draco, or even if he fails to win Draco over, Dumbledores words have a knock on effect and influence him later?


** I've wanted to see an AU where Dumbledore and Snape are a bit more proactive in making sure that Draco doesn't become an actual, rather than merely attempted murderer +--- because there won't always be a Hermione around the next time he uses an Unforgivable curse to smuggle an instantly deadly Dark Artifact into Hogwarts+.

In particular, grab him out of bed in the middle of the night, drag him up to Dumbledore's office, and have Dumbledore politely explain, in his inimitable grandfatherly fashion, that Draco is working for /him/ now, with Snape glowering in the background, and the only way to save his parents is to do precisely what Dumbledore asks...

*Edit:* Apparently, Hermione stabilizing Katie while Harry ran to get help was fanon. Thanks to [[/u/PsychoGeek]] for pointing it out.

Yeah, no. That would have get Draco killed instantly. His Occlumency would be no match for the Dark Lord's Legilimency. If he didn't go back to Voldemort, his parents would have been killed, and that defeats the point of Draco helping Dumbledore.

He'd only have to go back for Christmas, right? Dumbledore and Snape could probably just move the relevant memories to the Pensieve and Obliviate him. In the meantime, they could ensure that his plans didn't hurt anyone else.

****** I think there's plenty of room for suspension of disbelief there. For one thing, I don't find it difficult to believe that Dumbledore and Snape are simply better at Obliviation than Crouch mid-panic. Both of them, and especially Dumbledore, are unusually knowledgable and talented wizards, and they'd have time to do it right, versus having to do it on the spot. For another, in the case of Bertha Jorkins, Voldemort was already questioning her - he was LOOKING for something like that. He wouldn't really have any reason to suspect Draco of such a thing. We've also been told that Draco is better at Occlumency than Harry. I really doubt he's as good as Snape, who was able to successfully hide his intentions from Voldemort, but you know, Snape wasn't the only DE who hid his intentions, either. We don't know that Regulus was as good at Occlumency as Snape, either, and he wasn't much older than Draco.

I'm not saying it's something that would/should have happened in canon, but I've seen MANY far more outlandish fic ideas than this.

I'm not sure canon backs you up on this. Lockhart is said to be especially good at Obliviation. If there aren't different levels of talent at it, why would this be repeated multiple times? In addition, we know that Crouch actually DID do a sloppy job on Bertha... thus why she was having (unrelated) memory problems even before she disappeared.

And Voldemort noticed inconsistencies in her story while he was already interrogating/torturing her to get information, to be fair. And it might not be so much "inconsistencies" as her admitting she doesn't remember, or him noticing that she suddenly can't remember anything (see above about people noticing her general memory problems), while Peter probably knows that she didn't used to have such problems with memory.

But it's okay that you don't like the idea, and I'm not trying to talk you into liking it! Personally, there's a ton of ideas that I don't like and don't find to mesh well with my ideas on canon.

Canon is consistent with the proposition that Memory Charms are /always/ detectable, and it's consistent with the proposition that they can be hidden. (For that matter, does one get harder to detect as more time passes since it was cast? Does size and scope matter? What about Forgetfulness Potions and False Memory Charms? After all, all Dumbledore and Snape really want is information on what Draco is planning in the next week or two, so that they could ensure that nobody gets hurt.)

** I don't know any fics with this theme, but I think your analysis of both Dumbledore and Draco is incorrect.

Just a few ideas:

- Dumbledore was ambitious. Draco? Not so much. Dumbledore, at Draco's age, was leagues more talented, capable, and ambitious.

- Dumbledore sought power. Draco was born /into/ power.

- Dumbledore wished to rule over muggles for personal reasons (see: Ariana). Draco wants to rule over muggles because he believes his blood is superior.

- Dumbledore joined Grindelwald in a quest for the Hallows. For personal reasons. (see: Ariana, relationship with Grindelwald)

- Dumbledore - "For the Greater Good". Malfoy - "For the Malfoy's Good". Very different.

And perhaps the most significant difference -

- Dumbledore was an intellectual from a young age. Malfoy is the type to loathe even the concept of being one.

So, they are very, /very/ different people, with only a vague and slight resemblance in actions, and completely different intentions.

Truly, I don't think there is any student we know of that Dumbledore would feel comfortable mentoring. Hermione, perhaps, has the mental aptitude, +but her naivete and trust over her cunning and lack of ambition+ probably stop that from happening.

I believe Dumbledore felt pity for Draco's situation, and genuinely wanted to help Draco out of his dilemma - not because he thought he saw a part of himself in Draco, but rather, because Draco's situation was horrible and one that should never, ever be imposed on a child.

That's a rather fanon-tainted view, IMO. She did have a lot of ambition, but it was Gryffindor-ambition rather than Slytherin-ambition: ambition to Change The World --- whether the world wants it or not --- rather than ambition to obtain personal and/or social power (and comforts) for oneself and one's own; and in that, she actually has more in common with young Dumbledore who was, you might recall, motivated and Sorted similarly. I am not sure what "trust over her cunning" is about, but in terms of naiveté, she's no more naive than any other named character in her year, and this sort of thing is something that is a mentor's job to fix.

There are good arguments for the proposition that in terms of finding a successor for Dumbledore, it was slim pickings in the entering years of 1991±2; but of the ones we know, Hermione is probably the least bad candidate, though Cedric is another good one.

*** Yeah, I'd have to agree with [[/u/turbinicarpus]]. Hermione is very ambitious. I'm genuinely not sure where somebody would get the idea that she isn't.

She's also not particularly naive or trusting. If anything, she's rather ruthless. Remember this is the girl who (secretly) put a permanent curse on a piece of paper she then had schoolchildren sign, including some as young as 12! I would also definitely say that is "cunning" behavior. Many of her other actions can be described as cunning as well - leading Umbridge into the Forbidden Forest, for example. If she wasn't a Muggleborn and wasn't so idealistic, Hermione would have done very well in Slytherin.

If you're calling her overly trusting because when she was very young, she was inclined to trust teachers (Snape, Lockhart, etc.), well, she was a little kid and that's probably the way she was raised. She grew out of it pretty fast, certainly by HBP. Or maybe she's being called naive because of her idealistic nature? Well, I don't think the two go hand-in-hand at all. You can be idealistic and also pragmatic. Hermione wants to fight for a better world, but she doesn't have any illusions that the world is already a good place - that's why she needs to fight for a better world!

Actually, I'm surprised at someone saying Draco is unambitious as well. I don't think that is true at all. Just look at his behavior in HBP (bragging, wanting to be the best DE, not wanting Snape to "steal his thunder"), plus he is of course ambitious to be on the Quidditch team, etc. etc. I don't think he shares the same sort of ambition as Dumbledore or Hermione, but he was sorted into Slytherin for a reason and it's not just his family name.

EDIT: Also, why do you say Draco hates the concept of being an intellectual? I don't think he IS an intellectual, but I don't remember him saying anything to imply what you're claiming. He becomes a sort of researcher later in life, collecting obscure academic books and studying them. That doesn't really seem like the behavior of an anti-intellectual to me.

**** I agree on Hermione, except for one part - her idealistic nature often gets in her own way and in the way of pragmatism (see: S.P.E.W.).

Her actions in the fifth book are rather ruthless, which is around the same time she balances her idealism with pragmatism very well. I suppose I was looking Hermione from the first two-three books, rather than her actions over the whole series.

However, I do think Draco is not nearly ambitious enough. Cunning? Very, when he wants to be. But ambitious? Not really. He was born into power, he has it at his beck and call ("my father!"), and when his father is thrown into prison, he doesn't go looking for more.

Wanting to be the best are something that every DE was going for (maybe even Peter), and the whole DE-thing was something he seemed to regret. He certainly wasn't sorted into Slytherin for his family name, but still, he doesn't have the personal ambition required. If he has any ambition, it seems to focus on being better than Harry, and perhaps a bit of politics (Inquisitorial Squad) - not much else.

Hogwarts-Draco /really/ didn't seem the type to pursue academics and books. However, it has been quite a bit of time since I've read canon, so I might be wrong.

People can certainly change throughout their years at Hogwarts. On the topic of students apprenticing Dumbledore, I was looking at younger years more (in terms of personality) - and it only makes sense that kids in their early teens aren't mature enough to be considered for mentorship.

And if anything, Draco is more loyal to his family than he is ambitious for power - very unlike Dumbledore.

***** Oh, I agree with you that Draco and Dumbledore are dissimilar, and as I said, it is a different sort of ambition. But I think he DOES go looking for more power when his father is thrown into prison. He was desperate to become a Death Eater to re-establish his family in Voldemort's eyes and gain esteem for himself (being too foolish to realize what he was getting himself into and that Voldemort had no intention of him succeeding).

And even if wanting to be the best is something that every DE wants, I don't see how ambition being common among that group makes it any less ambition. I mean, most of them are Slytherins, it makes sense that most of them are very ambitious.

Yes, he does regret it later, once he gets a cold dose of reality and realizes what it all means, but he still felt that way at the time.

I'm basing the comments on Draco's academic interest later life on Pottermore/quotes from JKR, not the books. In the books themselves, I don't really see a lot of evidence one way or the other. Your interpretation is not necessarily WRONG, but you were presenting it as if it was canonical fact, and I think that's not accurate.

But despite these few quibbles, it seems we mostly agree on Draco's character after all!

Regarding Hermione, I did assume you were basing it on the later years since the thread was originally talking about 6th year.

Fanfic by writers of all genders who feel the need to reduce her to damsel in distress (sometimes literally) for a rescue romance (or worse); fanfic by writers who seek to elevate other characters by degrading hers --- often so that their protagonist could condescendingly school her on the facts of life; and fanfic where her sole purpose of existence is to facilitate the protagonist doing great things, so that her life could probably revolve around (usually) his.

It really depends on exactly how social dynamics work inside Slytherin, I think. Hermione is not as fragile as fanon makes her out to be [1]. To turn around the infamous line used to motivate the AuthorityWorshipper!Hermione fanon ("Killed --- or, worse, expelled."), Hermione considered leaving Hogwarts a fate worse then death. She'd stick around, and she'd show them all, unless the whole darned House (including years above hers) made a concerted effort to make her drop out --- and Snape didn't put the kibosh on anything too overt, since he /is/ kinda sorta responsible for the physical safety of his students.

#+end_quote

I think that most Slytherins we learn anything about --- like Draco and Slughorn --- tend to have very small-time ambitions. Draco is into self-aggrandizement, into being praised and into being fawned over, but ask him if he wants to be Minister of Magic, and he'll probably tell you that it's too much like work; and Slughorn seeks creature comforts and getting to rub elbows with celebrities and accomplished people. (It's telling that he used a dose of Felix Felicis to just have a nice day.)

Voldemort seems to be an exception in that sense. (Snape, we don't really know what he wanted out of life when he put on the Sorting Hat, and most of his decisions by the time we see them were forced by circumstances.)

All in all, I wonder if there's a pattern: purebloods from traditionally Slytherin families Sorted Slytherin tend be so to assume their proper place in society as successors of their parents; but halfbloods and Muggleborns Sorted Slytherin tend to be Sorted there because they actually have potential for greatness, and will either achieve it or crash and burn (or both, like Snape).

--------------

[1] Many people are misled by the events preceding the Troll Incident, but it's paramount to notice that /Ron was not bullying Hermione/, but rather expressing frustration at what he perceived as hectoring by her, and Hermione knew that he was not bullying her.

#+end_quote

This is actually a really great point. I think there could be a couple of reasons for this. Perhaps halfbloods and Muggleborns who could fit into Slytherin tend to be sorted elsewhere if there's an equally good option, so the ones that end up in Slytherin are the ones who express Slytherin traits particularly strongly. But also the purebloods from the old families already have a lot of power and social status. Their ambitions are pettier simply because they don't NEED to be anything else. They're already pretty much where they want to be. Both Tom Riddle and Snape were starting from a much lower position. And then, of course, you could imagine they'd have to go that much farther to prove themselves to their fellow Slytherins.

And good point about 11-year-old Hermione setting a teacher on fire. She was still a bit more trusting towards the teachers in general than Ron and Harry, though, I think. Being inclined to not think teachers are murderers not being the same thing as worshiping authority!
