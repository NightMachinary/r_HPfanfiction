A pretty big, but by no means exhaustive, list of fanfics I liked:

HPMOR

Backwards with Purpose: Always and Always (IMO, the best fanfic)

Hogwarts Houses Divided (but not looking for this kind of fic right now; I'd like somewhat more mature characters)

HP Wastelands of Time

Innocent series (the one where Sirius adopts Harry)

Magicks of the Arcane

The Naked Quidditch Match

I've also just finished reading the Aurors, and I thought it was quite enjoyable.

Thank you!

Edit: Literally just stumbled upon The Arithmancer- very much like the concept!

** If you like time travels, "The Red Knight", linkffn(12141684), is new, Ron centric, and different.

If you like R/Hr, "The Dark Lord Never Died", linkffn(11773877), is very nice. "Divided and Entwined", linkffn(11910994), still in progress and from the same author, is another great R/Hr fic. Dumbledore and Voldemort are very dangerous in both stories.

It appears you haven't found [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]] yet. Most of his 84 stories deal with continuation after the war. "Strangers at Drakeshaugh", linkffn(6331126), is IMO his best.

Another great Ginny centric fic is "The Changeling", linkffn(6919395).

My favorite fic involving the canon pairing is however the "Seventh Horcrux", linkffn(10677106). It's a parody and highly popular on this sub.

"The Voyage of the Starship Hedwig", linkffn(7135971), is sci-fi where Harry led his people to a new planet. This fic has some good ideas, but the writing is not so good.

  This is the first of a series of books I wrote for my kids set in the Harry Potter setting and occurring at the same time. These stories are meant to interweave seamlessly with the HP books and focus on characters primarily in the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff houses. The Tamblin books are a tad darker than the HP books, starting at about the level of the 3rd or 4th HP book.
