What the fuck is it actually about?

I was very impressed that someone has typed out 2.9 million words and is still at the beginning of third year.I have tried to get into this story a few times and never quite managed it, the first couple of chapters always manage to shut me down. The writing seems to stretch from slightly bizzare to straight up incomprehensible.

Feel free to provide a short summary of each year and any number of spoilers, I'm very curious as to wtf happens down the line.

(except for the lemons, those are kind of obvious from the pairing list)

[[https://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=270&textsize=0&chapter=2][Link]] for the curious.


** I haven't finished for two reasons: 1) the amount of unnecessary writing for everything (including the sex scenes) and the sheer graphicness of some of the scenes (sexual and violent).

But from what I have finished (after 1st years winter break), Harry is a top tier Necromancer because he found a multi-dimensional magic tome. The tome presented him with various schools of magic to learn from, and as long as he sticks to his chosen field, the tome will continue to teach him. If he gets greedy, the tome will move on to another dimension.

He becomes a massive drug (potions) and sex trafficker (willing and clean girls only), and murderer (of undesirables), from when he finds the tome (at 8 years old, I think). Hermione is a devoted follower/slave, along with two OCs (that are both one year below in age), as well as actual characters like Tonks (who is only 2 years old then him), Susan, Hannah, and P. Clearwater.

The actual point of the fic from the little that I have gathered, is that he is learning Necromancy because he wants to resurrect his mother, so that he can spend meaningful time with her. And I think he also wants to get massive revenge on Voldemort for killing his family.

One of my biggest issues with this fic (besides that the fact every character exalts Harry countless times, some times in the some scene) is that Harry is shown having sex, but then is at the same time, in his head able to push the pleasure aside to work on a magic problem. I find that fairly unbelievable and a bit ridiculous.

Even though kids having underage sex is a bit squick for me, the actual Necromancy part of the fic is pretty cool. The problem is that while awesome it comes around like every ten chapters. And it is pretty funny that NO ONE is normal, the Flemels have live-in slaves, and use the slaves to keep themselves young, and the Grangers are into torture and murdering people (but only those that are criminals).

**** True, but I don't think about it too much. The literal age of the characters isn't reference all that often. I just imagine that Hogwarts starts later then in canon.

Even though the author has lampshaded their youth, by saying that due to the high level Necromancy they are performing, they have slightly aged themselves. By like 2 years at the point that I am at.

** 3mln words and still at the beginning of third year? I'm the opposite of impressed. This probably ranks amongst the worst things ever written in the history of mankind, right up there with My Immortal, Mein Kampf and 19th century English poetry.

*** Hey now, Kipling was 19th century and he was kickass.

The rest were pretty terrible though.

**** Ah yes, the man who talked about the importance of "The White Man's Burden," clearly a shining pinnacle of 19th century poetry. Also author of the Jungle Book, which heavily insinuated how savage the natives of the mother country were

***** But the poetry was still solid, even if you don't like the message. Ever read the Female of the Species, or If? They're some of the best poetry in the English language. Kipling was a produce of his time, and actually rather progressive in many regards.

****** That's fine, but I don't have to think of him as "kickass." I spent basically the first 8 years of my life in India. I'm obviously not gonna stop anyone from reading his work, but being a produce of his time is no excuse to allow him to be put on a pedestal.

Could be. Still very impressive, if only for the dedication and sheer will required to type it all out.
