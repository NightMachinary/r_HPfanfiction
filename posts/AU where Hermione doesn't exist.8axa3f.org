Like, there's no mention of her. At all.

Thank you.

edit:

good lord, I don't hate Hermione or anything. I don't /love/ the character, but I read HP for HP. i'm just a bit bored of seeing her in stories. it's not that unreasonable a request. some people get tired of reading about a manipulative dumbledore. i'm tired of reading harry potter stories that involve too much hermione. she has positive traits, but that's another issue. i'm not asking for stories with a well rounded hermione. i'm asking for stories where she isn't there.

if good ones don't exist, are there other people who'd be interested in that?


** There's probably a few fics where due to Suspiciously Specific Butterflies she dies alone at Halloween in first year, with only cursory screen time before that. Close enough?

  On the Way to Greatness, and I believe she was withdrawn from the school.

No, she's still around, or at least her leaving isn't mentioned. She and Harry just don't interact that much.

** There's nothing wrong with wanting to read a story without Hermione. I'd be interested in reading one just because it'd be different.

** There's the Unicorn At Hogwarts, but it just puts a different studious socially-awkward bookworm (Twilight Sparkle) in Hermione's place. Plus it never got tremendously far.

...Now you've asked, though, I wonder, what does happen without Hermione? Aside from Harry & Ron's written homework slipping a bit?

Well, for starters, in the first book, Quirrel probably succeeds in jinxing Harry off his broom in his first Quidditch match. Dumbledore isn't at that match (in the book, anyway), so if Flitwick (local charms master) isn't quick enough to slow Harry's fall or McGonagall doesn't soften the ground in time...splat.

How would the episode with Norbert(a) play out? If Hermione's not there but Ron still gets bitten, will Harry be able to move the crate by himself (with a levitation charm, probably)? Would the detention in the Forbidden Forest still happen?

What about the second book? It's Hermione who manages to put Harry's hearing voices together with all the other clues to figure out the basilisk; are they lost without her? Do things actually go better, with Ron connecting more with Ginny (since Hermione isn't around to draw his attention) and inadvertently helping her fight off the diary? Or does the lack of a muggleborn friend place Harry under more suspicion when he's outed as a Parselmouth?

Hmm, I wonder what else...[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6qebmq/removing_the_weasley_family_from_the_cannon_plot/][there was a question a while back about what would happen if there were no Weasleys, too.]]

*** They didn't need Hermione's clue to find the Chamber. If Harry didn't seem to know what the monster was, Tom would probably have tols him in his Evil Monologue.

There's a lot more to consider, though. Why could we guarantee that Ron got bitten by Norberta? Maybe Harry was helping Hagrid that day in this AU, and he was careful enough not to get bitten? Also, what if Hermione stopping Quirrell also stopped him from getting caught? Or what if Snape were just seconds away from breaking the curse?

*** Not OP, and I love her canon character, but fanfiction tends to twist her into things that she never was. Hermione is neither supposed to be a Wikipedia sex goddess nor a weird rule fetishist past year one. Sadly, those are the two dominant characterisations which you'll find on FFN. She probably wouldn't be the most pleasant person to be around (unless you are into nagging), but a few vocal users here forget her substantial contribution to Harry's success and only see her as a magical Hitler reincarnation eager to suck Dumbledore's dick because she is a good sheep following his vision of the "Greater Good".

***** Annoying with her prejudices and ignorance of the magical world, her bossyness and nagging and/or the fact that if she's to be a pairing for Harry, she suddendly becomes more Emma Watson than Hermione Granger.

****** Ah. The OC does have better social skills than early-canon Hermione, but she still has most of those traits (except for the Emma Watson related one).

In any case, "prejudices" in this case is a mater of being firm in one's ethics, and "ignorance" is natural for a Muggleborn, and room for character development. "Bossiness" is just another word for assertiveness and leadership (though practically never used to describe a man's behaviour---funny that); and outside of bashfic, the things she "nags" about are usually a good idea anyway. Getting rid of those traits sounds like the makings of a profoundly boring and ineffectual character.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
