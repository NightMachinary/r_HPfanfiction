** I'd prefer it if the books had no ships at all. Rowling is horrible at writing romantic relationships. The only relationship I really liked is Harry/Calypso in The Santi's Boy Who Lived.

** Well as my original ship was H/Hr, i'd nominate Forever Knight ([[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/index.php?act=read&storyid=5185&chapterid=&agree=1]]) to represent just how good that pairing can be. It would not exactly rewrite canon as it is /Ahem/ more...mature than cannon. However, it has always been my go to for a good H/Hr rec and I have only really received positive feedback from those who have read it after I suggested it.

**** Awesome! Check back in and let me know what you think. For me, the second chapter to the point of the prologue are too fluffly but they are important to establishing their relationship.

****** The prologue is a scene from later in the story. Thats the point in the story I normally start from. Edit: let me explain a little more. The prologue is from part 2 of the story (somewhere like chapter 13 or 14). I skip to this part not as a knock against the first part of the book, but i feel like the second one is where it really sets itself apart from all other Harmony stories. Homecomming or comming home or something, is the chapter where it felt like most of the fluff for fluff's sake disappeared if i remember correctly. By part 2 in the story, Hermione has come to terms and accepted herself independant of Harry and all that. This is where I like to start because I already know all the backstory and how they got to that point.

** Well, seeing as Forever Knight and Vox Corporis -- probably the two best H/Hr examples -- have already been mentioned, I'll go in a completely different direction.

I don't know what sort of morbid curiosity drew me to it, but I find the clashes of character in Tom Riddle/Hermione fascinating. The best example for this that I've yet found is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5034546/1/Ultima-ratio][Ultima Ratio]]. It goes without saying that this wouldn't serve as a canon rewrite by JKR for a multitude of reasons (not least of which being that the relationship is necessarily dysfunctional, at best). However, it is interesting to examine what caused Tom to become Voldemort, and whether his humanity could have been preserved under different circumstances.

  When Tom Riddle walked through a doorway one fall afternoon everything changed and he found himself in a world wholly unprepared for him. "Something about you makes my brain itch," Hermione Granger said. "As if an earthquake had shifted everything sharply two feet to the left and then back again and it didn't all fit back quite right." Some BDSM. Tomione. AU

"I'm working on the 'kill Lord Voldemort, work out the temporal paradox issues later' plan," she tells him. He laughs. Tomione. COMPLETE

Some of my favorite pairings are Harry/Fleur and Harry/Daphne, but I can't think of good examples of the top of my head. Another of my favourites is Harry/Tonks and I think linkffn(Harry Potter and the summer of change) by lorddwar I believe to be one of the best.

** Olympics? All right, then, even though there's not a snowball's chance in hell JKR would consider making my pairing canon. Not for a microsecond. Frankly, /I/ can't imagine it. Even so, let me step up to the plate and represent my side.

...which is Snape/Harry, one of /the/ dirtybadwrong ships in HP and from my perspective one of the more interesting cases of popular --> vilified after the rise of Tumblr and the increase in mainstream participation.

Anyway, the fic that first yanked me into fandom is still one of my all-time favorites, Snape/Harry in all their dysfunctional glory, and it contains a boatload of trigger warnings: underage, mindfuck, Stockholm syndrome, graphic sex between a teenager and his much older professor (although readers should remember that Snape is about 35 or 36 as per canon, not Rickman's 60-ish), betrayal, noncon, and other issues I've no doubt forgotten. It also has one of the most brilliant versions of Snape I've ever read, cruel, enigmatic, manipulative, ruthless, radiating a horrific moral ambiguity and intelligence, with just the right ratio of snarl to sarcasm, and a more powerful and dangerous self-determination than he ever actually evinced in canon. The tension between Snape and Harry is off the charts, and it is delicious.

linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/13439]])

At the other end of the scale (since my feelings about my OTP are strung between two poles) is another fic I've recced a few times here. It's compassionate, romantic, and streaked with poetry, which upsets some people because they can't stand to see Snape described in those terms.

linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3836032]])

Fucked up and dysfunctional on the one hand, semi-tragic and obsessive on the other: that's my ship.

#+begin_quote
  Narm is a term used on the website [[http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=TV+Tropes][TV Tropes]] for anything that attempts to achieve some kind of dramatic effect but, whether because of poor writing or poor acting, tends to instead be unintentionally humorous rather than dramatic.

  The term comes from the show "Six Feet Under." During the climax of its last season, its main character is stricken by a brain embolism. As he suffers from the effects of his sudden seizure, he begins yelling the words "Numb arm," quickly slurring it into a single syllable.

** These two Harry/Ginny oneshots represent the pairing well.

linkao3(Compromise: A Love Story; Heir to Nothing but Herself)

I really like the Harry/Luna interaction in linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom). Unfortunately, the relationship is just a tiny part of the story and it never really goes anywhere.

Hmm. Ginny or Luna? Why not both? [[http://mujaji.net/%7Emujaji/repository/viewstory.php?sid=173&index=1][Back to the Garden]] (register to read) handles the dynamics between the new trio extremely well. I also like the Ron/Pansy relationship in the same story, which I haven't seen done elsewhere.

  It was not Harry's heroism, Ron's desperation, her mother's love, or her brothers' toilet seat humor that brought her back (though the toilet seat helped). Ginny breathed deep at night. She wept. She remembered how to rage. She snuck out at night and stole each of her brothers' brooms in turn. She took to the skies and brought herself back to life.

** Hermione/Draco - [[http://dhr.accio.nu/gravidy/the-god-of-the-lost/][The God of the Lost by Gravidy]]

Picking it because this is the story that made me see the potential of the pairing. It tears both characters completely out of the setting of Hogwarts and isolates them with each other. They are grown up, and in my opinion stay true to novel characterization adjusting for aftermath of the end and time to mature afterward.

Pretty much every other story by same author is worth reading as well.

** Somehow, no one has posted any Harry/Ginny, so I'll give it a shot even though I don't really read for the ships. I guess my favorite for this pairing would be The Refiner's Fire trilogy linkffn(2163835) or maybe Harry Potter and the Psychic Serpent (this one is older and not on ff.net, just google it ya lazy people). Both are really good stories that focus a decent amount on the ship but also have good action/plot besides.

Oh and definitely check out Aspirations linkffn(4545504) for another good H/G, this time with dark magic and costumed vigilantism!

  AU. Harry is shunned not only Ron, but Hermione as well after the Goblet of Fire incident. Ginny befriends Harry and history changes. Future Dark!Harry Dark!Ginny pairing, extended summary inside. Note from 2012: I'm not a huge fan of this story now, but leaving it up for historical purposes for those who do enjoy it.

** I don't really like any canon charactors!Harry, but i agree with [[/u/Almavet]], Calypso is the best OC ever made in fanfic history and those two fit really well together, but not too well.
