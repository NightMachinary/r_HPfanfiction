I've seen this idea in several good fics but I was interested in other opinions and ideas about this. The Patronus spell is powered by happiness and can be used as a guardian against dark creatures, as well as a messenger. Ignoring the latter, what if someone powered a similar spell but with a different emotion. It is canon that the Unforgivables require hate or rage to power them, but what about sadness? Fear? Grief? I was thinking of a spell that creates a corporeal being but has a different effect. What about a depression based spell that summons all your sadness and creates a feeling of overwhelming inevitability? This could be used in a crack fic (harry uses a a spell called the Depressus and it causes all the DEs to give up like in Hitchhikers Guide) but it could also be a genuine branch of magic. What are your thoughts?


** Emotional manifestation as a branch of magic is quite interesting.

I would suggest that Fiendfyre should technically qualify if it requires hatred of something to cast.

Then, of course, there's whatever made the dementors - depression incarnate, in my view(lacking all good things, eventually making you just give up and stop.)

That of course leaves things anger, hope, sadness, love, faith, envy and so on.

Anger: Creates some form of animated weapon, with potential other effects, such as a hammer that can be used to break down a wall, a flaming sword, a spear that is wreathed in lightning, and other overt elemental effects. Variations on cold anger could instead include ice or the like.

Hope: Would create something like a patronus, I think. Hard to see what to do with this one. A passive presence slowly warping the world towards what one hopes for?

Sadness: Think water, darkness, and not necessarily cold. Field of magic in which fighting is harder.

Love: Probably something bloody terrifying in actual appearance, if the room in the DoM is anything to go by.

Faith: A manifestation of what one believes in, possibly a counter to Hope, sadness, Fiendfyre and anything the caster does not want to see enforced magically on them. Dunno.

Envy: Eldest born of hell. Giant fuck-off snake/dragon that breathes highly corrosive magic, poisoning everything except the object of your desire. Repeated use of the spell causes severe harm to the user.

*** I always figured the Patronus spell was actually fueled by love, not happiness. This also explains the spectactular backfiring for dark Wizards using it -- they use "happy memories" fueled by hate/cruelty rather than love. And the confusion in canon about using happy memories make sense -- usually, your happiest memories also feature love in some way. Why, otherwise, would Harry fail to accomplish anything at all by using memories where he was clearly very happy, but not very loving memories (such as his first wand)?

Harry's memories fueling his Patronus weren't exactly /happy/ but they definitely feature love. I'd argue that Snape was probably in a similar situation as Harry, which also explains why his Patronus is the same as Lily's. This would also explain why Umbridge was able to cast a Patronus -- she was probably at her happiest doing some kind of sadistic task, but if she used a memory fueled by love -- be it for her cats or something we don't want to know -- it explains why it was stable and didn't backfire on her.

This would also explain why the Patronus was so hard to cast -- because of the misconception about you needing happy memories, rather than loving ones. Harry, an average wizard, was able to cast the Patronus at 13, and aside from resisting the Imperius, that was basically the only things he did that suggest that he is truly magically powerful -- otherwise he's rather average in general.

**** To me the Patronus Charm utilizes happy memories of that which you LOVE the most, true, but only to fuel one of the most primal instincts: To protect that which we love, if you fight to save your life you Will fight with strenght but If you do it to save someone else, specially someone you love, you'll find strenght you didn't knew you had. Thus the Patronus acts as a defender fueled by primal love.

**** I really like your concept and I think I'll adopt your point of view about the love rather than happiness. I agree harry is pretty average on general. I love good god!harry fics but in canon, Harry is average but lucky. Thanks for your input. Its greatly appreciated. Btw what if a spell could be powered by sadistic love or happiness?

*** Its funny that you should mention Fiendfyre as a spell that requires hate to perform. My belief is that, in canon, it is labelled dark due to its power and destructive nature. In many fics, Harry or other characters use it in fights and dont use hate to power it. In a few fics I've read, it is written as a spell that is easily summoned but very hard to control. That being said maybe using hate could be a way to control it. Thanks for your ideas. Envy I have always thought of as being a subtle killer. Maybe an envy powered curse would wither or weaken or maybe sap the strength of another and return it to the caster?

**** I Headcannon myself that Fiendfyre is fueled by pure rage which also explains why it's so hard to control. There are six basic emotions: Happiness, Sadness, Disgust, Anger, Surprise and Fear. If Happiness and the desire to protect the source of it brings the Patronus, and Headcannoning that Anger and the raging desire to consume everything brings out Fiendfyre, I imagine something like this: *Fear: Using your own source of primal Fear you can cast a defensive barrier based on terrorizing attackers (thus creating a Boggart). *Sadness: You channel your worst moments in life to summon a happiness-eating creature (thus creating a Dementor). *The other two I have no ideas.

***** I like the idea that sadness and fear being about the existence of dementors and boggarts. Maybe you are right with the Fiendfyre idea although I guess it is up to the writer to decide its mechanics. I would say that surprise and disgust are not really core emotions. Happiness, sadness, anger, and fear certainly. Perhaps envy or jealousy as was previously mentioned? I'm no philosopher nor am I an anthropologist etc, so I cant say definitely what every humans' core emotions are. Perhaps envy brings about Ron Weasley? Btw what is Headcannoning?

****** Headcanon is your personal Canon regarding something, for instance I headcanon that the Terminator saga ends un T2. I used the "Emotional Intelligence" approach to define the six core emotions. I believe as well as you that strong emotions bring powerful Spells, and Envy should bring a terrible curse.

**** See, envy and jealousy get pretty intense - hence fuck off huge poisonous dragon/serpent. Admittedly, I'm drawing somewhat on a sort of vaguely Christian interpretation, inspired in particular by Handel's Eldest Born Of Hell(lovely piece of music about Saul going mad over his envy of David).

So I reckon the eldest born of hell is going to be the classical serpent in the tree turned up to 11. The patronus isn't weak, after all, so an envy equivalent wouldn't be either.

Of course, that's for the Envy equivalent of the Patronus. An envy powered stunning spell for example might do exactly what you say re withering.

***** I get that idea. That being said the Patronus is never said to be that powerful. Harry's is pretty powerful but only because he has a unique perspective of love (assuming it's based off love). That being said the scene in the films when harry casts it is absolutely fucking amazing and gives a real sense of power so you're probably right. Cant remember the book scene but I get the idea it's similar.
