Does anyone have any stories where Voldemort has something other than horcruxes to keep him alive? The only one that I know of is linkffn(3417954).


** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10349675/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lightning-Scar][Harry Potter and the Lightning Scar]], [[/spoiler][the Dark Mark siphons magic/life off of the Death Eaters and Nagini, through a thaumaturgy like process, to keep Voldemort alive.]]

*** I don't know if I've read that one, but I've always had it as head!canon that that is how the dark mark behaved. It was proof that Voldemort hadn't died the first time, because it would have completely dissapeared the Dark Mark from his servants, if it didn't kill them by completely siphoning all the life/magic from their bearers to try and keep Voldemort alive. Then again, that is proved to not be canon by the continued survival of Draco Malfoy in the epilogue, but I don't like that either, and so just ignore it too.

**** It's definitely not the best fic around, and it's got a bit of that "America is so great! Boo Magical Britain" that some people don't like, but I think it is balanced out pretty well by the Pine Barrens. [[/spoiler][Jersey Devil man, don't mess with that shit]]. And it has a magical animagus and custom wands [[/spoiler][though they are made from feathers from Harry's magical animagus, so that actually kinda makes sense in my brain]]. That all being said, I fucking love this fic. Not sure why, don't particularly care why.

***** The "Go, America" vibe is a bit much, and could easily be edited out, or at least toned down a touch. But that said, I love this story.

Rowling's magic is very much made up on the spot, but this author has tried to give some structure, and reasoning behind the how and why of certain magic. Its not taking it apart and making it science, but its very much making it seem more grounded to me.

I like to reread this story on occasion. It gives Harry access to some rare magic, which he uses to great effect. It may go a bit towards the overpowered side of things, but its nice to read a Harry that can get things done. And it does so without just saying "And harry just decided that wands are stupid, its all about will power and visualization. Harry then just waved his hand while focusing greatly, and voldemorts suddenly dead body appeared, and his ghost cried out cursing the Potter name as it faded into the afterlife."
