** Lol it's not beyond reason that they could animate Olaf, if not give him a personality. Generous application of cooling charms and he can last all year! Cast Draco as the douchebag who needs a Greengrass to rebuild his family's name/wealth and Harry as the gnome dude. Ron is Sven. I've only seen Frozen once, so I really don't know their names. I'm a sucker for Harry/Astoria just because I hate Draco and he doesn't deserve happiness. Post-War, Daphne flees to get away from pure blood expectations and the rep of her dead DE father? Astoria goes to find her gets into a tight spot and Harry helps her out?

I would like to see Harry/Astoria, though. I don't think I've seen a serious attempt before.

**** There's a few out there, but none (as far as I know) that are actually good. Linkffn(Finding a Place to Call Home) is probably the best of a bad lot, though there's also a zombie apocalypse au that I haven't read on account of it being a zombie apocalypse au, so that might be better.

Incorruptible: The Dementor's Stigma by The Matt Silver is what you are looking for.

I also have not read it. I tried, but couldn't get into it. Iirc part of it for me might have been that the HP/AG ship was (or at least started, again I didn't get far) as an affair.

#+begin_quote
  A year has passed since the dead started returning to life. The fate of those hoping to survive and rebuild rests on the best and the worst of humanity, both wizards and Muggles, with their political ideologies and the ravenous undead in between, and it's up to Healer Harry Potter to save as many as he can in the crossfire. A Harry Potter Zombie Apocalypse Fanfiction. HP/AG.
