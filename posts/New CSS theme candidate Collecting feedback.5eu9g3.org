Hello, all,

+Given that the current theme is (still) a tad bit buggy and unfinished, I've been looking for elegant alternatives to our current theme. I've updated [[/r/fanfictionbot]] with a potential theme candidate.+

+### Please check out *[[/r/fanfictionbot]]* and tell us if if we should use its theme by submitting [[https://goo.gl/forms/0BsWGpFKN96GTwbC2][*this Google Form*]] (and perhaps leaving a comment)!+

Edit: Due to very positive response from the poll we're going ahead and implementing this theme!


** Doesn't look bad typography and layout-wise, but I can't read light-on-dark without getting a headache.

***** You should download [[https://redditenhancementsuite.com/][Reddit Enhancement Suite]], and there are a whole lot of functions, one of such is disabling subreddit style per subreddit.

You can also do this in your reddit preferences (but it disables subreddit styles for all subreddits).

**** Well the default style is ugly, but at least readable.

Thanks for the tip.

** No more random capitalization is nice. Otherwise, there is no improvement, mechanically or visually, over the old interface.

** Well, it is a bit late but I will give you this bit of feedback: the flair icons we have do not seem to look well on the new theme, due to the white (or whitish) outside pixels that were supposed to blend with the white of the theme but now don't.
