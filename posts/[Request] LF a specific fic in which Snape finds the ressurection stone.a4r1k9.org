-I've just noticed I spelled resurrection wrong in the title, sorry about that

What I remember:

I read it fairly recently but it might not be a particularly recently-written fic

The resurrection stone bit was just in one chapter, if I remember correctly it was multi-chaptered. The resurrection stone was not a main feature in the fic I think, just a part I remember

He was with other people when they found the stone and disapparated with it turned it and saw lily, afterwards he was found I think by Mcgonagall, maybe another person

-That's all I can recall. The fic likely involved also Snape being injured in some way and/or tortured at a death eater meeting as I read a lot of that (as an aside I'll happiliy take recs for any fics like that). Or actually I think it might have been post-deathly hallows with Snape surviving


** I don't know of the fic but I have to say that the concept is really compelling -- to the point that I'm surprised it isn't covered more often. Usually if Snape meets Lily post-mortem, it's because Harry has enabled her return to kick his arse or otherwise tell him how horrible he is.

How did the author handle their reunion (if you can remember)? How did Lily treat him and how did he react?
