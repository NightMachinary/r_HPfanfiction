Looking for stories where McGonagall stops the feud between The Marauders and Snape, or stop the fights between Harry and Draco. Or looking for a McGonagall that questions Dumbledore more and argues with him.

Also looking for stories that deal with Filius trying to help people help students like Luna, and other similar things as well.

Or even have Professors do more against Umbridge, or just something.


** linkffn(Harry McGonagall) has a Minerva who does something about Snape.

linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) is about Harry growing up with Sirius and Remus, both of which later become defense professors.

linkffn(Just a Random Tuesday) is amazing, it's just one very detailed tuesday in the life of Professor McGonagall during late 5th year, dealing with Umbridge, pranks, the Weasley twins, secret Order business, aurors, etc.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path) has a rather young Professor Babbling who takes care of Harry.

  Professor McGonagall has watched the Dursleys all day and can see what sort of people they are. When Dumbledore leaves Harry on their doorstep and disappears, she takes him away. HHr

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

  A VERY long Tuesday in the life of Minerva McGonagall. With rampant Umbridgeitis, uncooperative Slytherins, Ministry interventions, an absent Dumbledore and a schoolwide shortage of Hot Cocoa, it's a wonder she's as nice as she is.

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.
