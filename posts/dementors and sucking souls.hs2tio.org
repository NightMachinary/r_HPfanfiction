everyone here agree's that dementors can suck souls out in canon. but do they really? REALLY? lets break it down shall we.

dementors kiss proves the soul exists? YES

MoM says soul magic of any sort is foul and evil? Probably.

now heres my thought. why would they use a being capable of consuming souls as a death sentence. they used to use the veil if i'm correct. i mean even fudge while corrupt and incompetent is not evil per say. so why did he allow a dementors kiss to be authorized on Crouch JR. makes me wonder if dementors even eat souls. see my theory is that dementors are foul horrible beasts because they eat MAGIC. not souls. but for many wizards they might think both are one and the same.

it would explain why even light sided magic users can not see muggles as much.

now as for the death causes. can a wizard/witch live without their magic? would it kill them or leave them brain dead.

plus who says that it even kills. its said that they just become brain dead. could that just mean comatose? people can recover from that. i've noticed that the wizarding world (WW) has poor knowledge in regards to much of the medical advancements that muggles have. anything that can't be found in physcal regards is never treated. PSTD, child abuse, even date rape(Love potions) are all treated as silly. the closest we have seen is giving out candy.

maybe the issue is that WW can't see that one can ever live without it so they let the comatose patient die without ever trying to wake them.

not to mention the lack of any real religion we see could just mean the WW worships magic.

+the patronus charm could just be considered allergic to them/(like nuts are to some people, toxic and deadly)

and are there any real(in canon book) references that muggles are affected by dementors. aside from dudley's attack we don't see much on that. and even then he mostly got freaked out by the lights disappearing and the cold. he recovered really really fast.

but even then could they have sucked out anything?

â€‹

so my theory is that dementor devour magic and the WW sees one's magic as the soul itself..

â€‹

what are ya'll's thoughts.


** Oooh interesting! I like that theory a lot. Surprisingly, I was just thinking if dementors tonight and saw your post. Dementors sucking the magic makes a lot of more sense. Especially when fanlore has magic being (basically) the lifeblood of wizards and witches. When they lose their magic, they start dying. In fanfics at least.

I was just thinkig tonight, why didnt they have a dementor kiss the horcruxes from Harry and the objects? Was it just too risky? Or maybe that isn't a plausible solution because when a dementor gives their kiss, they take the soul and hold it hostage in their own beings? So then voldemort would then never be able to become mortal?

Honestly those I've theorized on anything in HP lol

*** I have seen a fanfic where the opposite happens. At the quiditch game in PoA a dementor realizes he has a piece of Tom's soul and chooses to take Harry's knowing that Tom would allow them to feed more than anyone else. Therefore thus the dementor chose what was best for dementors.

** The dementor's kiss does indeed leave the person brain dead, and no, you don't recover from that, you can recover from a normal coma though. And not all soul magic is considered evil, the Fidelius charm is actually soul magic, it hides a secret within the soul of the secret keeper. And the only dark magic that is considered illegal as far as we know is the killing curse, the cuiciatus and the imperius, and even those have been legalized two times (for Auror use in the first war and during Voldemort reign in the second war).

Not sure about the other implications of your theory.

*** The Fidelius is soul magic? Hmm. I was not aware of that. As for the AK and other unforgivables. I'm almost positive there are other curses that are illegal. i just think we were not given examples for making this easy for JKR to remember. lol. And like i said this is all theories

** Could you please move this question in the Harry Potter sub-reddit? This question is related to a generalized discussion centered around the Harry Potter universe. However, this is the Harry Potter /fanfiction/ sub-reddit. Therefore, it would be preferable if questions in this sub-reddit are exclusively connected to fanfiction.

I am not trying to police but the thing is that I found another question in this fanfiction sub-reddit in which someone complained about Hermione's characterization in fanfics. Those responding to it used it as an opportunity to bash book Hermione right, left, and centre over the fact that she regurgitates answers, and some even said they would enjoy seeing her meltdown in case she failed an assignment!ðŸ¤¦ It was as if everyone was venting out their frustration of movie Hermione and fanfic Hermione's characterization over book Hermione!! I am not joking.

Movie characterization is improper and everyone starts bashing the book characters!ðŸ¤¦ðŸ¤¦ðŸ¤¦

Basically, this fandom is unable to distinguish between book canon, movie characterization, and fanfics.

Therefore, to keep things in order, it would be preferable if this discussion were to be shifted to the Harry Potter sub-reddit - [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/]]
