Normally I wouldn't be making a LF post, but lately I haven't been able to find many Slytherin!Harry of my liking, so I'm resorting to this.

So I really like Slytherin!Harry, but there's a couple of tropes that show in most of them that I just don't feel like reading anymore.

I really want some fics where Harry actually shows the house traits like being cunning, without being a megamind badass.

I want fics where Harry isn't way smarter than Canon. Being in Slytherin doesn't equal to being a smug smartass who is also OP. Smarter is alright, but not top of the class smart.

Actual children characters. They talk like children, they don't care about politics because they're children, they don't use their free time to study all day long, they go and have fun playing or hanging out if they're older because they're children.

No bashing please. It's not my thing.

Some interesting plot that makes the fic differentiate from all the other Slytherin!Harry fics. It doesn't have to be an amazing entirely new plot, I just want something a bit different than canon.

Tropes like WBWL is alright, if it's done in a interesting way that hasn't been done already 1000 times.

I don't care what pairing it is, but I'd rather not read slash, nothing against it, just not my thing. Femslash is ok though. My favorite pairing is Harry/Daphne but again any pairing is fine. Or no pairing at all. I like to read those too.


** Have you read linkao3(The Devil You Know by Silchasruin)? It's unique, funny, and fun. The sequel is a frequently updated WIP

  All Harry Potter ever wanted was to finally be accepted as someone other than an incurably criminal boy. A fresh start in Slytherin - which, admittedly, does seem to have a worrying proportion of goons - seems to be just what he needs to make some lifelong friendships. And if that life happens to be an immortal one, all the better. It's too bad that the high-pitched voice in his head has other ideas.

** This is a WBWL, but it's unique in that he has a living parent who loves both children equally. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20144149/chapters/47724034]])

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4330836][the heir of something or other]] is a work in a series of 'what-if' one-shots (e.g., what if Dudley was a wizard?, what if Neville was the boy who lived?). This one asks, "What if Harry had been sorted into Slytherin?" It's lovely and covers Harry's years at Hogwarts.

Linkao3(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus by The_Carnivorous_Muffin) is one of the most unique fics I have read in my fifteen years in the fandom. It is unlike any other I have read. I find myself struggling to encapsulate my feelings in words, so I think the less you know going in, the better

Happy reading!

  Only two people know what happened the night John Potter became the Boy-Who-Lived: Lord Voldemort and Harry Potter. And neither of them are talking.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.
