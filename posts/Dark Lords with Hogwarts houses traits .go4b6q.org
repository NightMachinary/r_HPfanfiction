Hey guys, we know that the young tom riddle was basically an incarnation of Slytherin traits, he was charming resorseful, cunning, manipulative and had a great self preservation sense, bot have you wondered what a Gryffindor or Hufflepuf dark lord would be ?

Slytherin Dark Lord - Much like the Voldemort from the first war and the young Tom Riddle, has a great thirst for power, and uses their charming personalities to gather followers, and slowly builds power trough political means, do not get me wrong, because of their ambition to be the best they're generally great at combat but their most scary power is the capacity to manipulate the common people with fear and his followers with awe, making the other believe that this Dark Lord is something above all else. This ones want to be recognised as the bests, they want to become rulers and legends.

Hufflepuff Dark Lord - Basically a revolutionary, thei're the kind that were injusticed by the society and their desire for justice leads them to fight for a better world, they believe themselves to be right a have a very strong moral compass that makes them target their enemies, generally those in power and they tend to avoid colateral damage and are idealists to the heart, their followers are companions, brothers in arms and friends that are bounded by and ideal, dream or loyalty. This ones wants nothing more than make the world a better place.

Ravenclaw Dark Lord - Mad scientists that want to discover new things at any cost, they don't have any morals and different from the Slytherins that are very good to mask their emotions, Ravenclaw dark lords are utterly cold, they are distant emotionally and sees human lives as guinea pigs, they tend to murder people for their magic experiments or to wreak havoc in the society for their psycological and social experiments, generally they don't have followers because they simply are searching for answers for their twisted questions, not caring for ideals or power. This ones just want to elevate their minds and dicover more and more.

Gryffindor Dark Lord - The powerhouses, the most unpredictable and dangerous of all of the houses, because they're guided by their emotions, passion, rage, love, hate, they don't care about power, followers or ideals and are guided just by their impulses, making them the most demented and unstable, there are few of them because one can just reach the title of Dark Lord acting reclessly and alone, being a very powerful wizard, that dont care about anything than making rain fiendfyre on their foes, they're brave beyond the sanity and love the thrill of the battle, don't caring if their enemy has ten times his numbers, they don't see or care for the conscequences of their acts and are capable of bringing down entire governments if it means to appease their emotions. This ones, just follow their urges, vengeance, love, hate or even boredom.

Have any of you guys through of this.\\
It was just an ideal that came to me, most of the times in fanfiction if there are other Dark Lords they have the same personality as Voldemort, power hungry, manipulative and cunning, even those Dark Lord Harry fanfic make this.\\
Harry is very reckless in the books and most of the time is guided by his heart, i think thet he would be the typo of Gryffindor Dark lord instead of those fics where he is a carbon copy of Riddle.

  Hufflepuff is the house of the leftovers, the losers, the forgotten. Well, Tom Riddle thinks, it's time to change that.

  In the end, it didn't really matter what road he took. Tom Riddle's destiny was, is and will always be in the form of Lord Voldemort.
