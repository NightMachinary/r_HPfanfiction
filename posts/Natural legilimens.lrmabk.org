I am looking for a specific fic with a fem harry who is a natural legilimens, it was on ao3, i could remember that she beat the 1 year troll by making it go to sleep.

Alternativly any fic that focuses on legilimency with intresting mechanics would be appreciated.


** The Good War, maybe? I can't remember if the troll event you described happened, but I think she's a natural at mind magic: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23747950/chapters/57035011]]

Here's another rec for one that has a lot of focus on mind magic: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29013294/chapters/71209311]]
