It starts off like a normal Harry gets falsely convicted and sent to Azkaban story. Ginny's body is found with "donations" from Harry in and on her. Harry is convicted and goes to Azkaban. Harry spends a year in Azkaban before Lucius arrives and stabs Harry to death with a silver dagger. It's then revealed that Harry was framed and Ginny wasn't even dead but rather she was kidnapped by Voldemort.
