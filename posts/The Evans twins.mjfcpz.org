So I have a ton of fix ideas in my notes and not not enough skill to write them. So I thought I'd share.

Dumbledor sends baby Harry back in time (maybe alternate timeline) with a note to his past self.

Past Dumbledor takes baby Harry to the Evans family and alters their memories to think that Harry and Lily are twins.

They discover their magic together and befriend Severus who tells them it's magic.

Possible slash. Severus has a crush on BOTH Evans twins ðŸ˜‚

Maybe Harry goes to Slytherin with Severus while Lily still goes to Gryffindor
