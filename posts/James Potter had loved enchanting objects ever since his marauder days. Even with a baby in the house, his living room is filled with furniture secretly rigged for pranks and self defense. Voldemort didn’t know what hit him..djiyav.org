** Is it just me or is it very weird seeing people suggest that James can also set up protection for Harry and not just Lily? Love me some proactive James, it's a very underused trope.

  COMPLETE. James Potter casts his own spell to protect his only son; but he was never as good with Charms as Lily was. (A more ruthless Harry Potter grows up to confront Voldemort). Dark!Harry. Slytherin!Harry HP/HG and then HP/HG/TN.

*** That reminds me of that one thing on tumblr where someone wrote a short story that ended up with Voldemort being completely caught off guard when he enters the Potter Cottage to find a random buck standing in the living room. Prongs proceeds to stab Goldie with his antlers and when people turn up expecting to find the deceased Potters they instead find a dead Voldemort with several stab woulda being kicked at by an incensed Lily Potter with a little Harry in her arms. I think it was by PocketPadfoot but I'm probably wrong.

Honestly, if Kevin wasn't a kid, the movies would essentially be Saw. The fact it compares directly to Die hard is telling.

But then the follow up Harry goes to Hogwarts and +murders+ pranks his teachers and peers.
