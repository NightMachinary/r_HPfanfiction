A darker and serious tone. Harry Potter has always been the MOD but he does not realise that until an event triggers it to show (ex. He touches the veil of death when he reaches out for Sirius).

After the event, it changes Harry to someone more serious, who suffer different death-related nightmares. Things started to change vastly. Ghosts start to fear him, there are creatures of death who are attracted to his aura, and Dumbledore looks sadder, older, and stressed out (not bashing). Death Eaters takes him more seriously and Voldemort actually becomes more dangerous.

Harry's friends stick with him (no bashings) as he goes through with this. Like him, they too start to change when they start to witness and realise the true situation before them (ex. they see someone die or they witness a war where it's just blood everywhere).

/Additional:/

Hopefully no ships but it's fine (absolutely not with tomarry, harrymort, snarry or anything with large age gaps just no).

Harry does not join Death Eaters or partners with Voldemort.

Not somewhere in the 7th where they are out of Hogwarts. This would be nicer around the 6th year, after the OoTP event.

Harry doesn't go from 1-100 overnight or suddenly the next merlin after he realises that he is the MOD. A more realistic pace would be awesome. Maybe a pace similar with the *Cadmean Victory by DarknessEnthroned*

*Petrichor by BlameMyMuses*. Absolutely amazing, just what I wanted but it's not finished.
