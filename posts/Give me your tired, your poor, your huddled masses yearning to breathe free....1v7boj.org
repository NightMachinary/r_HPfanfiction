This is the place to post any works, your own or others, that you feel need more love. Welcome fics include:

- WIPs

- Fics with low numbers of reviews

- Fics by authors who are still writing and could use some support

- Fics that get a bad rap on this site and others, but in which you see redeeming qualities

- Fics that you feel are otherwise underappreciated for whatever reason

Any genre, pairing or rating is ok with me.


** Totally thought this was going to be a thread about fics with Harry going to the US.

Still working on it. It's my first fan fic, so its a little bumpy. I posted it here months ago when I only had three chapters then, but that was about it. I try to update weekly. It's AU/ M/romance/hurt&comfort and OC, so not everyone's cup of tea, but yeah... figured I would put it out there. It's Neville/ OC pairing. The OC being the twin sister of Draco, and it all takes place 6th year.

** I always thought Perspicacity's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4889913/1/Hallows-and-Pathos][Hallows and Pathos]] was underrated compared with his other work, perhaps because he listed the main characters as Harry and Hermione despite the story's sticking to canon pairings. It's a dark tale, not to everyone's tastes perhaps, but an underappreciated gem of the fandom.

Another underrated story is chelsyb's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7053607/1/Running][Running]], a "what if" if Remus and Tonks had survived the final battle, written after the author's life had taken her to some bad places. It's not as polished as some of her work, but has a sort of raw pain and authenticity that I appreciate.

**** If you like dark dystopia, sure. Perspicacity's ([[/u/__Pers]] when he posts on this sub, though he hasn't in awhile) stuff is all over the map, topically and quality-wise. /Dagger and Rose/ is angsty Harry/Fleur romance. /A Mother In Law's Love/ is ribald comedy (it begins with Harry and Molly W. in a soul bond) that turns weird. His short story /India/ was an action/thriller about Hedwig with an ending that, I'm a bit ashamed to say, made me cry. Some of the one shots in his collection are fantastic writing for fanfiction; others are subpar.

Chelseyb writes one of the best Tonks in the fandom. The story I linked is pretty short, but her [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7746111/1/Harry-Potter-the-Halfblood-Auror][Harry Potter and the Halfblood Auror]] is novel length and quite good (though hopefully not abandoned--last update was September).

** - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8374306/1/A-Serving-Extra-Large]] WIP Harry is a Half Giant on his mothers side. (mother is still Lily) It is explained well without taking too much of a leap of faith.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9977668/1/The-British-Reformation]] WIP Flarry. Your run of the mill Harry thinks everyone betrays him so he runs away to Black Island.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9939304/1/Si-Vis-Pacem-Para-Bellum]] WIP Prolly the one I am most looking forward to getting updated. All the Blacks (Andromeda, Narcissa, and Sirius) move to Bulgaria. Viktor is the same age as Draco and Harry.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9914932/1/Harry-s-Horses]] Awesome WIP that is prolly the most different story I have read. So far its just about Harry working with horses prior to his 3rd year.

** The Pureblooded Turncoat by me. Its very much a WIP and is on a bit of hiatus due to the sheer workload I have this year, but it's my baby and I am determined to continue (things should start getting better for me around march and then I'll have plenty of time to start writing again). It's an AU of 6th year where Draco went to Dumbledore and the order for protection when Voldemort gave him the task. It's eventually going to be Dramione, but certainly not yet (only a few chapters in, it's definitely a baby of a story). All from a Draco POV and I'm definitely trying to keep him and everyone else in character as much as I can. I would say it's a little on the sparser side in terms of reviews so I'd love more feedback! Here is the link to my fic on Dramione.org (you'll need to be a memer but signing up is pretty painless): [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=2115]]

** Currently writing, actually, going through and revising as well as having a few betas pick it apart since I'm having second thoughts on some bits. I'm still in the middle of a chapter and school is starting, and I need a pick me up so that I can muddle through =(

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7070742/1/This-Once]["This Once"]] is a Viktor/Hermione romance, but with angst and suspense mixed in. "Good things always come at a price, but neither Viktor or Hermione expected their twice found love to be so hard won."

Rated M for Mature, matey. There is smut, but it's part of the plot-line. Half my battles are me quibbling over whether or not something is "romantic" or "purple prose" (BLARGHL), as well as hashing out action sequences and peoples physical movements because I'm obsessed on mapping things out and making sure everything is within continuity. Which makes my brain tingle.

** This story recently took second place in the HPFanFicFanPoll Awards a few days ago in the Best Drama-Angst category, and I'm surprised to see it has so little reviews on ff.net (42 reviews for five chapters).

It's called Resonare Mortis, and should please all of those who prefer a darker side of fanfiction. The story features the characters Hermione Granger and Severus Snape, but does not pair them romantically in any way. Both are true to canon characterization, and the plot is surprisingly original.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9855722/1/String-Theory][String Theory]]

It's my try at an OC fic. Just a way to fiddle with bits of canon and have some fun. Each year will be more and more divergent from the books and written with an eye toward a specific genre. First year, for instance, is a more proactive heist plot. Eventually I hope to go deep into the formation of Hogwarts and address whether or not Herpo the Foul's horcrux was ever destroyed.

I understand the stigma against OC-centric stories, and if you don't want to read fine by me, just thought I'd put it out there for people to check out.
