Tom Riddle escapes his Diary - and Hogwarts - at the end of Chamber of Secrets, only to discover that all the carefully laid plans from his teenage years, well, they didn't exactly pan out as expected.

A tale of a Diary that was a little more independent, and a little less puppy-murderingly evil, than he was really given credit for.

It's my very first fic, and the reviews have been very kind so far, but I need more people to tell me about the parts that they didn't like so I can learn from it.

** Nice, I really like it. You write in a quite fast style, moving from one arc to another with little space in between. Its good because then you will get to tell your story much faster, and you aren't sacrificing being coherent for speed. Because of that it will never be one of those great epics like the Prince of Slytherin, but a VERY enjoyable afternoon flick.

Personally I really like it when the plot moves away from cannon but your current style, of following cannon and then going on side adventure only to return, is probably for the best in the end. It's really build up the world, Lord Voldemort and Tom.

​

I have just a few gripes: Why the first two chapters? They only follow cannon and you aren't switching up stuff and the character development isn't really impressive, chapter 3 alone blows both out of the water in that regard. Neither does they give the reader an established way of seeing the protagonist because you later switch up enough about the character. Just go back and think about if they really should be there, or is it better for the reader to go into the action before thronging through two unimpressive chapters. Its not a good thing when the chapters supposed to convince the reader that this story is worth it, is the two worst chapters in an other-vice great story.

You come up with some really nice magical artifacts. And most I can guess what they do just from the name. But the Magical Hammer... what size is it? At first i imagined a two-handed Warhammer, but now I'm envisioning one of those doctor hammers they use on your knees.

*** Thanks for your feedback!

​

I'll definitely take your advice on the first two chapters into account if I do a revision of the story later on, you make a good point.

Czernobog's hammer I initially describe in Chapter 5 as an enormous maul, but didn't give an exact description. It's about four or five feet long, with a large, blocky rectangular head of black iron. It weighs about forty kilograms, and behaves as such for all but whomever is currently holding it; their strength is amplified significantly and so it feel much lighter.

However, I have since been describing it as being drawn out of coat or trouser pockets without making note that these pockets are magically expanded spaces, so I can see the source of the size confusion. I'll go back now and make that clearer, should be fairly easy to slip that in. I might start referring to it specifically as a maul more often too.

**** Nice thanks. And yeah I should have guess that in Hogwarts, desks drawers and expanded spaces. :)

** This is amazing so far. There aren't many fics out there that can stay mostly loyal to canon and at the same time develop its own universe in a cohesive manner.

My only suggestion would be to maybe add in other character perspectives. I know that it might be a bit jarring to suddenly add in other POVs but if done right, I think that brief glimpses into Dumbledore or Voldemort's perspectives could be interesting.

** I know this comment is late af but I just started reading your fic and it's so amazing! The premise is truly unique and the personality of your Tom is so fun to read. I really wish there were more fics like this one out there!
