The First War was hyped up as some big event where Voldemort was an unstoppable juggernaut and years of fighting. Then the second time around Voldemort just takes over the Ministry in like a year.

Now, I get that the Horcruxes were intended to be both an Achilles heel and the hubris which caused his downfall. But focusing the entire second war on hunting them down makes the whole thing seem very small in scale and there is a lack of other things happening. The Order is running a radio show... and that's it.

No international entanglement and attempts at intervention, no real resistance, no other theatres of conflict, just Harry, Hermione and, for 2/3rds of the time, Ron camping in a tent. We don't need ten chapters on ICW debates until they decide to intervene, but a few lines here and there would add so much depth.


** OKay, so a few points.

1. Horcruxes were just not any hubris. They were the crave for immortality against anything else. The fear of death, so natural, propelled to super-villany. As far as plot mechanisms, Horcruxes are good stuff. It's Dorian Grey and Fountain of youth with magic all around.
2. Pacing is valid, though might not be as exciting as alternative. The whole point of DH was how crucial Horcruxes were. Take that as meta commentary in "you all crave action pieces" in a similar way Ron is craving for the Elder wand. You should focus on what needs to be done, on what solves the conflict and saves lives. Not on spectacle.
3. We have Harry POV all books, we were not about to abandon that in book7. The books are more Harry progression as a character than fighting magical hitler. Harry's peak moment after Dobby died as a character is what we have been driving to since book one. That was the realization, which climaxed on his self-sacrifice.
4. The Order surely did amazing fight and spying, but it was not Harry's POV.
5. Most wars are not about a major battle taking place every other week. A good punch avoided more battles later on. Battle of Hogwarts was so effective in defeating Voldemort that there were no major battles after it.
6. Guess you could have had the spectacle and the books spirit if you did a book 8. With book 8 mostly focused on Harry fighting alongside the order. Though that would have its difficulties to pull out and goes beyond the 7 school years JKR intended for the series.

My personal preference is however more inline with OP. I'm less than happy with Deus Ex Machina, plot armors, and the "Lucky Hero" trope allowing the good guys to win the war. I especially find that Wizard Jesus message disturbing, which boils down to: "oh no, we have no choice but to sacrifice a child to save ourselves from that sadistic genocidal maniac!"

It wasn't really. Harry believes that he has to die, ergo someone else has to finish things. He is under the perfect invilisbilty cloak. He does not even try to take any other Death Eater with him, the "surrender to die to get resurrected" thing only makes sense in retrospect.

Like, Bellatrix Lestrange was there. The last time they met, she killed Sirius and he Crucio'ed her. And now he's like "hmm, the landscape is pretty this time of the night". If he thinks that he has to die, some 300-esque last stand would make a lot more sense and it would still fit the "there's no greater love than lying down your own life for others" theme.

He kind of had to, yeah. The book was going to isolating Harry more and more. First distrust of a traitor within the order. Then, the run away. Then the conflict with Remus. Then thinks Ron and Hermione are talking behind his back. Then Ron leaves. Then Bathilda and Godric Hollow, representing his parents, are against him as well. Then his wand. Then, he starts distancing from Hermione as well. Putting people from the Order casually appearing would de-escalate the isolation JKR was going for.

Kingsley was undercover. The thing with spy stories is that the less the public knows, the better. He might have been about to get caught plenty of times. Maybe they undermided raids on muggleborns. Etc. Aberforth was helping muggle students. Remus and Hagrid could have things going on with werewolves and giants.

The war did not start the day Voldemort took the MInistry. But the day he returned. The Order had been moving against him since then. There were disapparitions. An attack on Arthur Weasley and others on the DoM. Amelia bones was killed. Hogwarts was attacked on 6th year. There was a battle at the start of book 7 in the escape from Privet Drive. Another in Bill's Wedding. The longer the war doesn't mean it was worse. It taking longer doesn't mean 1st war was worse. ANd even if it was, it does not diminish the second war.

As I pointed out before things do happen, but we mostly find out those from Harry POV, like DoM. Who says there was no struggle when Amelia bones was killed? Or Emmaline Vance. Maybe they died after persecution. It's just that Harry was not there. Deceptions you say? What about Snape? Narcisaa... KIngsley undercover?

Do you understand what "complaints against the narrative focus" are?

That means that OP is trying to argue against the /foundation/ of the book. The point of the book is the hunt. What OP is saying is that perhaps the point of the book /shouldn't/ have been the hunt.

I, agreeing with OP sentiment, think that there should have been more focus on the actual war. That the point of book 7 should've been the war with horcruxes being an important part, but not the central focus. Maybe as the trio hunt down the trinkets they come across the destruction left behind a battle. Perhaps they get side-tracked as they help a group of prisoners escape. Something like that.

That's what "criticising the narrative focus" means. Criticising the very core of the story in that book.

****** Are you going to go into definitions with me? On my cake day?! The nerve!

The core. The foundation of the story was Death. I am not talking about DH only. The entire series is Death. Harry is a boy who comes from death. His parents died. He is the only one to have "cheated" death. HIs character is defined by death and those dying around him to protect him. That's why this "kids" series transcended because it touched this topic to kids. Since the first book.

It is only so fitting that the Horcruxes and the Deathly Hallows are the core of the final book. It gives another dimension to Voldemort. I don't think it ruins him as a villain, quite the contrary. The Horcruxes is given a special treat to Voldemort. A particular aspect to him to distinguish him from so many other villains. He seeks immortality. He is afraid of Death.

I wouldn't have the Horcruxes being any less important than they were in the book. They were the soul of the series theme. The perfect ultimate weapon for what Voldemort represents.

I wouldn't change that for more fireworks. I could have action in any other Stallone movie. Heck, I could see more of that action on the movies. The book delivered where it was supposed to deliver.

Potters battle. Bill's Weasleys was a confrontation yes. Spells were being thrown. INfiltrating the Ministry was also public and a struggle, spells were exchanged. Godric Hollow was a fight against Nagini and almost Voldemort, even if not public. Malfoy manor was not public but was conflict, skirmish, however you would like to call it. That was more than in previous books. If you add whatever the other guys were involved in. That was not small action for a year. As I said real wars usually passed months and months without large scale battles.

>Both would be better described as the Order rolling over and then doing nothing.

Not all have to be offensives. They were defending. Getting Harry away from privet drive. and it was certainly a battle. Describe it as you like.

>Snape was not involved in any "war" action for the good side and almost beheaded George, so I would rather count him for the Death Eaters tbh. His saving of the few at Hogwarts did little to impact the "military" side of things.

THe sword of Gryffindor. Prividing useful intel to Harry. Planting wrong info and using Mundungus. That's nice spy shit right there. The thing is you are misreading that as action/adventure instead of spy novel shit. If it was Snape's POV that would have serious spy theme and pacing.

The term I would use is "unnecessary waste of life". Harry had the fastest broom in existence. Unless Voldemort had a squadron of Spitfires around, he could have just outran Voldemort. Or just been side-alonged by any order member since the laws of the Ministry were pointless either way (Tonks could do this with perfect stealth).

  The First War was hyped up as some big event where Voldemort was an unstoppable juggernaut and years of fighting. Then the second time around Voldemort just takes over the Ministry in like a year.
#+end_quote

I like looking at it the exactly opposite way. The first war was an epic failure, which is proven true when Voldemort simply changes his approach, and instead of /fighting/ the Ministry just /embraces/ its power, putting in a very well-execute coup d'etat, and achieves everything he wanted in a month.

Personally, I find the latter much more intesting than the former. It was also very realistic. A coup hinges on having A) supporters in key positions, and B) an uncoordinated resistance resp. a largely apathetic public. That's exactly what we have in Canon. Muggleborns are a minority no one cares about, Purebloods sit in the most senior positions, ergo the Ministry bureaucracy is largely content to execute whatever is Ministry policy as long as it only screws Muggleborns, and the public shrugs as long as life doesn't change too much for the majority.

Of all of DH, this was by far the best part. The chilling atmosphere when Harry & co walk through Diagon Alley, the shocking realisation of just /how easy/ the takeover was, the indictment of a public that was content to keep their heads down instead of mounting any sort of resistance. This is how societies fall -- and it's far too realistic to be anything but supremely disturbing.

*** Agreed. I think OP has placed too much stock in the word "war". Just because the characters describe wizarding conflicts as wars do not mean that they will reflect Muggle warfare in the sense of having battles, territory, front lines, etc.

The best Muggle equivalent to wizarding warfare is probably a struggle between organised crime groups, not inter-state military action.

**** Even a turf war was more serious than the second Voldemort war. The first one was a decade long bloody struggle, the second one is basically three teenagers and useless adults. There is a disparity between the "hype" about how dangerous Voldemort really is and what we see him do, and that becomes especially evident in book 7.

***** Err ... He builds a totalitarian state, goes literally all Hitler and plans the magical holocaust, and in your view the hype about how evil he is is not all it's cracked up to be?

I don't quite know what to say, I guess.

** With all the emphasis put on how horrible, absolutely terrifying Vodemort's first reign of terror was, and Trelawney's prophecy about Voldemort coming back even worse than before, yeah, I agree. It's not that badass war shit didn't happen, but like you said, the narrative focus fucked over years of build-up.

** *The short answer:* Unlike the first war, Dumbledore is dead.

*The slightly longer answer:* During the first war, both sides had an uberwizard---who could defeat practically any number of lesser enemies and could only be countered by another uberwizard---on their side, so it dragged on. Voldemort took over only after Dumbledore died. At that point, only one side had the uberwizard, so armed resistance by the other side would only cause attrition on their side that they couldn't afford.

The Death Eater regime was actually quite slow and legalistic in its destructiveness and not very proactive in hunting down and neutralising its enemies. It didn't have to be that way, and more open warfare would have led it to escalate.

Therefore, it was to the benefit of the Order to lay low, preserve their numbers and morale, hide what Muggleborns they could, and wait for Harry Potter---the one prophesied to neutralise the other side's uberwizard---to do whatever he needed to do to do that, so that open warfare became winnable again. Hence the lack of other things happening.

** You are missing the genre, as much as they all have action moments in them, HP books are pseudo-mystery books, the Horcruxes were simply a plot devise to turn the war into a mystery rather than a military affair.

** Most of the First War is Voldemort being an outspoken political activist. We learn from Sirius that he gained a lot of support from blood purists, including his parents in the earlier stages and they were quite proud that Regulus became a Death Eater at 16, which would have been at the earliest in 1978. After a while Voldemort started his terror campaign which made a few of the blood purists, including the Blacks, withdraw their support for Voldemort. We also learned that several prominent pure bloods such as Orion Black, Abraxas Malfoy and the Potters (Harry's grandparents) died in 1979. So piecing all this information together, Voldemort's violence campaign only lasted for two years as well in the first war. I think most of the 70s he still spent the time recruiting while holding speeches against Muggle-borns.

Also the second war happens through Harry's perspective so you would not really get a proper piece of the action because he is acting secretively in order to avoid Voldemort's discovery of what he was up to. But nevertheless it lasts about the same, and, I believe, it's a continuation of what Voldemort had planned at first (killing Dumbledore and all potential competition and taking over the Ministry).
