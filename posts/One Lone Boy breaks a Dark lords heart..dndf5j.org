gave me an idea for a wicked prompt ill share with everyone. Voldermortes people are competent enough to get him back together in a few years instead of the 11 he has. Snape remembering Petunia has his mind read so Voldermort goes there to search for harry.. and finds him at age 5-7. But.. does not kill him

instead the dark lord see's the boy under the stairs, broken, hurt, being abused. treated worse than in his childhood. and he takes him in.. Harry vanquishes the dark lord by Make Lord voldermorte become tom riddle the man again. I seen pretty bastard men do shit to protect or harm those who harm kids.. what if he looses because he basically tortures's the dursleys and years of raising harry corrupts him.. middle if not light?


** Voldemort one day drops off the map, adopts a pseudonym and becomes his precious son's Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor at Beauxbatons.

The Death Eaters fracture into multiple smaller/weaker and less efficient units individually attempting to bring about their own "change". Some trying to influence the Ministry to better destroy Muggleborns whilst others wreak havoc and hunt for their Dark Lord (trying to figure out where he went and what happened to him).

Dumbledore himself is encouraging half-blood and muggleborn students to go to other schools for their own safety as his influence, stunningly, wanes more and more.

Eventually the Death Eaters find him and surmise that killing Harry will destroy this "distraction" that has poisoned their Dark Lord.

And thus Voldemort proceeds to dismantle and massacre the entire organisation he spent decades building.
