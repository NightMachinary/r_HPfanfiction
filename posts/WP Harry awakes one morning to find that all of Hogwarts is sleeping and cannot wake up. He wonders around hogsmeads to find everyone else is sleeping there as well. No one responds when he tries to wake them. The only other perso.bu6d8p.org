** Sounds similar to the premise of a story I saw a while back that stuck out to me but I never read, linkffn(3542099). iirc time is stopped(instead of your idea of everyone being asleep) and Harry and Voldemort are the only two not frozen. Looks like it's abandoned though, per the author's profile :/ Like I said, I never did get around to reading it, so can't say anything on it's quality.

  Nuclear war breaks out and Voldemort casts a spell to stop time. He and Harry alone are left to defuse the missiles and prevent the war. Voldemort's radiophobic. Oh joy. LVHP. Spoilers for HBP, none for DH.

** And after some independent research on each behalf do both realize that only by setting aside their hatred of one another (at least for now) and working together can they thwart a threat to magic itself and if either of them dies magic dies!

** A bit like subplots of Holly in linkao3(Holly at Hogwarts: Now and Forever by Forest_of_Holly) and linkao3(1143960). Especially the second one (“1984” with dementors!) is really great one.
