** I am totally imagining this scene where Harry wears green but being the colour-blind person that Dumbledore is, he sees harry wearing red instead. Then he proceed to give house points to Gryffindor whenever Slytherin was going to win. Or maybe the opposite would be more interesting...

** Dumbledore chortled old manningly. "I can't be prejudiced against Slytherins, Minerva, I'm colorblind. Those are some wonderful crimson robes, my dear."

McGonagall glanced down. Her robes were emerald.

Snape said, "That's not what colorblind means, Albus."

"Very good, Severus! Fifty points to Gryffindor!"

** Its the subtle shades of octarine that really makes those robes work.

** Somebody had an idea that magic makes all wizards and witches at least partially colour-blind. That's why they have all those ridiculous outfits. Not sure I agree (there is too little in the non-magical world), but just to record it.
