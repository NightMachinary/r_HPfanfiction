What are some cool ideas for inherited magical abilities, like parseltongue or being a metamorphmagus or even (though I prefer to steer a bit away from the part-magical-creature trope) the "Allure" of the Veela? The kind of abilities passed down through a family line, though not necessarily present in each member, that the family might be known for. Powerful, less powerful it doesn't matter; I just need ideas!


** I've had this notion that if Harry and Tonks had actually hooked up and had a kid, the poor dear would have animated hair, like Medusa of the Inhumans, though maybe less under control.

** I like that the idea of a magical affinity for the learning of languages, since we know in canon that Crouch Sr speaks over two hundred languages, which is pretty much impossible for a humam, meaning he probably used magic to help him.

Another I like is Voldemorts ability to infuse his voice with some force to influence others to listen to him, something he has shown to be able to do as a child. I could easily see something like this being inheritable.

I think both luck and bad luck would also work, with some simply born more or less lucky than others, we know afterall that luck is a real thing, since Felix Felicis exist.

** I read one where the Potters were known for their affinity for runes. Harry could feel the wards put up around Hermiones house from almost a mile away

** Instinctive Hand-eye Coordination (imagine being able to catch a knife in mid-air without looking); the ability to redistribute one's weight (incredibly useful for thievery and acrobatics); ability to talk to animals (Dr Doolittle); ability for emotional empathy (imagine knowing what other people feel in advance and in reaction to you); being able to see exactly four and a half seconds into the future; the ability to control the temperature of things; the ability to turn anything (yourself included) into a liquid and back again; the ability to manipulate liquids (waterbenders); the ability to set your blood on fire; the ability to turn your blood into solid iron; the ability to understand the causality of anything; the ability to give and take dreams; the ability to exude pheromones that induce sneezing fits; the ability to find pairs; the ability to make people forget exactly four and a half seconds of their past; the ability to turn anything into bread; the ability to call light on command; the ability to breath incredibly dense mist like a smoke bomb; the ability to cut anything with your fingernails; the ability to climb walls like a spider; the ability to absorb an entire book just by touching it; the ability to turn errant limbs into subservient clones of oneself; the ability to always be able to locate north; the ability to always be aware of the time; the ability to wander aimlessly and find what you're looking for; the ability to find fish; the ability to exude water; the ability to mimic anyone, but only in personality and demeanour; etc.

Random, I know, but spend enough time playing D&D and random spell effects become relatively easy to come up with - have to keep pumping out fun magical items to keep your players interested, but not power them up too much, right? :)

On the off-chance you do want more, feel free to ask. I can come up with these all day. :D

** Mage-sight and aura reading are pretty common. And I like to think that Veela blood gives you pyrokinesis, so..

** - Talents for runes way above the norm
- Curse breaking as a part of healing;
- Elemental magic (Neville's talent with plants seems like earth magic)
- Beast taming (like Hagrid)
- Talent for rituals, spell creation, potion creation, and healing
- Music magic, including influencing others by speech or singing like Fleur did the dragon
- Thread magic (knots or weaving or embroidery imbued by magic or via runes);
- Blood magic (warding, healing, curses)
- Weapon forging
- Enchanting items
- Jewel based magic
- Divining (finding lost items or people or animals, fortune telling, finding water or mineral veins or ley lines)

** - Plantspeaking/Plant-based empathy Neville belongs here. Can talk to/instantly understand/know what a plant wants.
- Beast tongue- parseltongue goes here. It's essentially the ability to speak with *A* species of the animal kingdom.
- The Inner-Eye- Divination goes here.
- Elemental- Supreme aptitude to a natural element, wandless manipulations/summoning and whatnot. Fire/Wind/Water/Shadow/Light/Heart/CaptainPlanet
- Shaman -can directly interact with ghosts/spirits AKA touching them
- Runic Dyslexia- The brain is hardcoded for runic languages. Non-runic languages being attempted to read/write get mixed up or are hard to understand. Insanely good at warding/enchanting.
- Savant- Insanely good at math/Arithmancy and/or memory-based occlumancy (or memory recall). You don't have to adhere to real life and just make them anti-social or a watered down asperger syndrome. Where they have no EQ at all and interact badly socially. You can place Madam Pince here. She knows the library back to front and sucks at people interaction.

EDIT: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7382549/1/When-Is-It-a-Contract][Question-teller]]- If asked a direct qustion, you get a nonsense answer. If make sure the question is modified and not direct, they will answer it. Even with knowledge they doesn't have.
