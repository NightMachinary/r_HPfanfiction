Hey guys, I'm new to this sub, but not to HP fanfiction. I've been writing a new fic (haven't posted it yet, I want to get a good number of words in first), and was wondering what kinds of things/events do people really want to see in stories. Good writing, a good plot, well written characters are obvious, but otherwise what draws you in?


** A complete thought-as in a story, or even sections of a longer story, where there is a thematic arc of beginning, middle and end. So many people can start a story, even make it to a mid-point complication, but then...

I'm also keen on seeing heroes in a situation where as the reader I'm thinking 'there's no way they can get out of that!' and then seeing how they did get out of it without inventing a new power, but maybe by accepting some other bad circumstances or displaying an ingenious use of materials at hand.

A real draw for me is re-establishing the mysterious and fantastic nature of magic, preferably without invalidating the existing magic system.

** Honestly, nothing. I just want the good writing, the good plot, and the well written characters. Anything else is gravy, and runs the risk of feeling like it was thrown in because it was cool and interesting, not because it served the plot.

I suppose, on a personal note, that I've always wanted to read a fic about a three-person relationship that didn't depend on some contrivance like a soul bond or a marriage contract. Or, more specifically, a messy, believable, in-depth Harry/Girl/Girl that didn't depend on the setting, and could have worked if it was a perfectly non-magical boarding school.

**** Well, yeah. Hence the fact that there aren't any fanfics (that I know of) that can pull it off. That's why I'd like to see a solid writer take a good swing at it.

You should give this a shot. It doesn't fulfill the Harry/Girl/Girl portion of what you would like but it is one of the few three-person relationship's that I like in fanfiction.

** - Creative use of canon spells (which seem to be quite versatile), rather then creating new spells that do a similar thing

- Banter between all characters, not just between Harry and everyone else

- I personally don't like it when fics contradict canon for no good reason, i.e. if it isn't necessary for the story.

- This is probably not what you're looking for, but I'd really like a good H/Hr story. It's my favorite pairing (and the reason I entered the fandom in the first place), but I can't remember a single story I would actually recommend.

** More quality Harry/Luna would be swell, I'd also love to see some Lightside!Bellatrix more, I feel like the description of her as a Hogwarts youngster would not give way to some crazy sycophant. She was supposed to be a pure-blood Hermione or Lily, and yet can't see past the bigotry she grew up around. I admit, it could certainly happen, but I like to think someone described as that intelligent would not side with the dumbest campaign for world domination we've ever seen.

*** I've thought that it could be easily explained as some sort of magical marriage contract between Bellatrix and an abusive Lestrange, combined with love potions and loyalty potions just sent her 'round the twist. She could have started as a Hermione-esque slytherin, who was given nothing but pain and suffering at the hands of her Husband. Then, due to her power and spellcasting abilities, she might have been given to Voldemort who further shattered her mind with the dark mark and a multitude of Cruciatus curses. Left with nothing but pain and misery, she had no other options than to go forth and wreak havoc, in a 'nobody helped me, so I'll just burn the world and dance on the ashes' sort of way.

** Harry/Ron/Hermione gets old. Every perspective on Dumbledore has already been done. I love to see different characters get more exposure. Different friends, unusual pairings, stuff like that. I'd also love guys like Nicolas Flamel or Grindelwald take more active roles; what's the point of having these demigods in the story if you're not going to use them?

On the subject of Nicolas Flamel, I'd also really love to see a good story where alchemy is more important. Methods of Rationality explains my feelings on this subject perfectly:

  If there'd been a mass-manufacturable means of safe immortality this entire time and nobody had bothered, Harry was going to snap and kill everyone.

** This is a bit specific, but I really enjoy magical competitions, dueling in particular. Think Triwizard tasks in The Lie I've Lived, group battles in Hogwarts Battle School, or the army thingy in the Methods of Rationality.

*** Check out Reign of the Serpent, it's WIP but an absolutely brilliant AU where Slytherin won and made Horcruxes. There's a caste system where Hufflepuff is the lowest and Slytherin the highest and Mudbloods are nowhere. You get your caste tattooed on your left arm to identify yourself, told from the POV of Hermione who is trying to become so impressive she gains caste status prior to Hogwarts (mudbloods captured as kids) and Harry who was booted out of Slytherin cause his Dad married a Mudblood.

Anyway, the battle competitions are just getting started but basically all of the students can create mini armies to fight in War Games as training for the battle against Grindlewalds forces that many join after graduating (read Gryffindor caste).

** One thing I can't recall ever reading is one of a BatshitCrazy!Dumbledore. He's always portrayed as a benevolent mentor, or a manipulative bad guy; what if he's just been around so much magic for so long that his mind has completely lost touch with reality? Not evil, but ignoring all evidence to Harry's mistreatment at the Dursley's, because "family doesn't do that", despite the fact that they did. Ignoring the prevalence of bullying and mistreatment the students act out on each other, because "they're just children, of course they wouldn't do something harmful to one another," combined with his absolute trust in Snape, who always marginalizes the actions of his Snakes.

** A series written as a serial (think TV show with episodic plot, seasonal plot, and overarching series plot).

A story that ends similarly to Animorphs where Harry is faced not with the choice of sacrificing himself but forced into sacrificing someone else.

A crossover with When the Wind Blows/Maximum Ride.

A magical society that aren't treated as sheeple.

A second magical world (ex Radaslab's Not Normal)

Evil (or just closer to mythology) centaurs

magic spin on non magic games (charades, pictionary,taboo etc).

Magical contests (best conjuratuon, illusion, transfiguration, charm, etc)

I can think of more but I have to be up for work in 3 hours unfortunately.

** A *balanced sense of conflict* is absolutely critical.

Angst generally relies on unbelievable character traits and forced misunderstandings to move the plot along. It's usually pointless as the reader is well aware that all conflict will resolve itself quite soon and with no repercussions to any characters involved.

On the other hand, broad over-arching epics can suffer from having the impending conflict seem too far removed from the characters immediate thoughts and concerns. How much did Harry worry about TMR during HBP? Hardly at all because he was consumed by his "chest monster."

I think the best consistent conflicts in stories I've read have all had one thing in common: believable character limitations. Making the protagonist a demigod sucks all impending conflict from [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor][any scenario in which they might potentially be involved]]. Similarly, making Luna a "Seer" also destroys conflict. JKR made a similar gaffe with OOtP's prophecy. One of the best rules of thumb I've seen says, "If you make Frodo a Jedi, give Sauron the Death Star."

** Well apart from the obvious that you mentioned I'd like to read more stories like Strangers at Drakenhaug where muggles interact with the magical world unknowingly.

A story where Petunia was a witch too

A Story where the Trio is genderbent (Girl-Ron, Girl-Harry, Boy-Hermione) no slash

but for a great plus are keeping as close to canon characterizations as posible. So no Evil!Manipualitve!Dumbledore no Deatheater!ron no Ron/Hermione No LovePotioner!Ginny Etc...

*** If you mean Northumbrian's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]], it is an excellent story and definitely worth reading (even if, like me, you don't normally like stories that don't focus on Harry, focus heavily on OCs, and focus on the muggle world).

I'd like to see more well-written, logically constructed, completed, crossovers of things that there aren't any real examples of yet. HP/Venture Bros. crossover, anyone?
