I'm staring to even lose track of what is canon at this point.


** I've started needing to completely reread a long fic when it releases a new chapter. I've read so many fics in between the last chapter and the new one that I have forgotten which world I'm reading half the time.

**** So I'm older, and I used to hardcore read fanfics when I was in high school while the books were still coming out. I cannot state how often I would get confused reading one of the new books, and thinks about a fanfic instead. Some fanfics are very well written, and it's hard to separate the canon and fanon!

** You know, I always thought this concept of canonicality (if that's even a word) can be pretty silly sometimes, I mean it's all made up shit at the end of the day, the only difference is that Rowling owns the IP and the rest of the community doesn't, but if a fan-made work connects with you in a meaningful way, then in your mind it can be as valid as JKR's work. And isn't that what matters at the end of the day? We're all alone in our own minds, so our perception of fiction can be anything we want it to be. Am I making any sense? Point is fanfics are fun.

*** Well, a counterargument to that is that while you can consider canon as the central unifier of all fanfic. All fanfiction takes the characters from canon and puts them in different situations and tinkers with them, if we don't consider canon to have a central role then we lose the deep characterisation that JKR did that makes fanfic so enjoyable.

In fanfic, nobody describes how Harry or Hermione or Ron look like or how they behave - writers just assume that readers already have an image in their heads for them and know them well. This is all due to the canon's central importance within fanfic.

**** Eh, I don't think physical descriptions need the base material strictly for the reader to have a clear image of the characters, that is mostly an issue with the writer and the way they direct their scenes. Someone competent will sneak in descriptors in between actions and narrations to remind you of who they're talking about. In Reign of the Serpent the author does describe Harry and Lily to the reader; you don't need to read the original saga to know what those two look like there.

In terms of characterisation, well that depends on the type of fic we're talking about: a canon-compliant one will obviously be quite reliant on Rowling's work. A 5th year fic will expect the reader to be familiar with book 1 through 4, but a large-scale AU? One that starts with, say, the fall of Voldemort? Well then, Harry and many other people's characterisation then falls on the ideas and talent of the author behind it, not so much their canonical versions.

Ultimately, I'm not saying to dismiss canon at all, for the community would not exist without it. My point is sometimes we focus a bit much on what is canon and what isn't, when in the end it is us as individuals who give meaning to works of art. We get to decide how important they are to us, and to that end "canon status" is pretty irrelevant.

***** But even beyond that, the world already has a lot of history the fans know. The characters might turn out with different characterization, but most of the time it doesn't erase their relations to one another. Even in an AU, unless its explicitly or implicitly stated, a reader will start reading with the mindset that Harry is James and Lily's son, Lily was friends with Snape, the Death Hallows exist, Dumbledore is the leader of the Order of the Phoenix, an organization that fights Death Eaters, the Weasleys have 7 children, Hogwarts was founded by 4 people, etc etc.

Even in a large-scale AU, even if the reader doesn't strictly /need/ the original material, it's always there as a background you can fall back on. We the readers fill in the details in our minds with unprovided information which makes the fanfiction that much richer in a way that, if it had been an original story, might just be blander.

*** I agree with that point of view entirely, that fan works can be just as interesting (or more!) than the story they originated from, but I also think it's important to remember what the source work was or you experience "canon drift", where the fandom seems to collectively edit their memory about what actually happened in the series and think fanon is canon.

Now I'd never say fanon is bad, since it provides a useful starting point from which to expand the HPverse like with the various students of Slytherin, but it gets annoying when people try to correct the author of a fic about how "wards" work (don't exist in canon) or how Sirius used to be a playboy (extrapolated from a single detail, never confirmed).

**** Agreed. Granted I don't like certain things but it's mostly just because it doesn't fit in the Harry Potter world. Wards for instance in my mind is just using that instead of saying a defensive enchantment over an area. My one thing is making sure whatever additions aren't overpowered and if they are then both sides should have them otherwise the story loses the appeal. Or making something like Harry is a god because we have to make him special and give him cool stuff to be able to do just because even if he'll never use it again after it's introduced. Case in point. “What arm is your wand arm? I'm ambidextrous” but that then never becomes relevant.

*** So true. Also, I actually like the idea of an ever-expanding fictional world. Basically, when the author gives access to their work it becomes something else entirely when it goes through the perception of the reader. I don't fully understand authors that don't like many interpretations of their works. It's just so amazing to see how a fictional story can keep living like that. So yeah, true 'canon' is a complicated term if you think about it.

I think it would be better after this problem with canonicity and different interpretations would be discussed more broadly because now, unfortunately, the whole fanfiction thing is more like a dirty secret outside fandoms. I don't like this at all, but hope it will eventually come to something.

** I sometimes imagine a HP meta universe (and would probably do so in other cases as well if I end up reading fanfics of it) as an infinitely sprawling network of timelines and divergence points, representating fanfic authors' various takes on things -- for example, looking at Harry Potter the character's timeline(s) would have a major junction point at September 1st 1991, showing all the various Sorting outcomes and what have you -- and several timelines thin out on character deaths, but not entirely, because of the occasional death-prompted Peggy Sues, jumping back to earlier points, or "alive!character" fics, etc.

Sometimes I even imagine an Department of Mysteries artifact which works somewhat similar to the Mirror of Erised, but instead of showing your deepest desire, you can request it to show an universe where X happened/did not happen, and it would reveal the most likely results of said change ("Show me an universe where Dumbledore didn't put on Gaunt's Ring") -- or reveal the most plausible means of how an universe gets to such a point if build-up is needed ("Show me an universe where Harry married Luna"). Said artifact would be harmless for people happy with their life, but dangerous to people with major regrets (similar to the Mirror), being tempted to see how things could have been, despite the inability to actually go there. There is a Lily-centric fic where an artifact in Purgatory works somewhat similar to this -- I liked the premise (but think some of the scenarios in the fic itself implausible) and have been curious if there's other fics with a similar premise.

** Yes and no, I have gathered over the years that I am somewhat odd in my Fic reading habits in that I keep a meticulous categorized record of fics, a kind of library including fics I've either read or intend to read. This has let keep a distinct separation in my head of the elements that are from canon, and from fanfiction. That said, there are elements from fanfiction that I effectively include into the canon, my own personal headcanon. The only absolute criteria being that it doesn't contradict canon to do so. One such element is from my all time favourite fic, "A Cadmean Victory" by Darkness Enthroned, in which there is a rather shady potions supply store in Knocturn Alley called "The Spiny Serpent" which is run by a vampire. This does not contradict canon in any way, and it has the benefit of expanding on an area of the universe left mostly untouched. In other words, the perfect place for fanfiction.

So no, I don't lose track of what's canon and what's not, but I do add in elements to my Headcanon that are not in the source material.
