Where harry potter is smart and designed his own abandoned classroom as a workshop with wards to stop and capture intruders.

But what harry got wrong was when he made wards to seal the classroom it stops all airflow. So when the weasley twins break into a room they see is warded, they die due to harry's mistake.

Now dumbledore has to protect harry from what he has done.


** Honestly, it doesn't even have to be a mistake. I've seen stories where Harry places a withering curse on his trunk.

Try and open my trunk to get spare parchment for me because I'm in the hospital without my permission, will you? */DIE/*
