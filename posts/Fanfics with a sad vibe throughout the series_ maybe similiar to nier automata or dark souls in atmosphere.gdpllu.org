Are you probably looking for something like this?

Or... [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9444529/1/Vitam-Paramus]]

The following one's ending has a somber tone.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6943436/1/The-Pureblood-Princess]]

This one is one of the best harry/femVoldemort fics on fanfiction.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11752324/1/Limpieza-de-Sangre]]

And this is one of my all-time fav: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11446957/1/A-Cadmean-Victory]]

Hope you like them.

I thought he finally founds her hidden(her parents had obliviated her to protect her but then she remembers everything) somwhere while grieving and they get together and marry, that fic got me pretty down until I read the ending.

It's one of my favs too, but it's not sad, their relationship is actually very happy, it's just sometimes the world goes to hell around them. And the ending is good.
