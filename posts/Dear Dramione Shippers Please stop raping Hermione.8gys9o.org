Look, I get it, it's hard to bring Draco and Hermione together, but if the only way you can do it, is by having Draco be her hero and rescue her from being raped or sympathize with her after she was raped, you're doing it wrong. Just stop.

Rape is already a really [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousRape][tropey]] plot device and I'm likely going to groan and roll my eyes (unless it makes perfect sense in the narrative), but raping Hermione just to make Draco look good is vile (and lazy). Extra deductions if the rape is used as an excuse to weaken her character and turn her into a quivering mess that can't stand up for herself, becoming completely dependent on others. I know you can come up with something better!

Please help me to stop my over-use of [[https://i.imgur.com/GVC6Z6B.gifv][this]] gag in /Fic Search/ threads about stories with Hermione getting raped.


** Is this really so much a Dramione thing? Attempted rape is depressingly common as a plot device, but I've seen it at least as often as a way to get, say, Harry and Daphne together, or doing it to Harry's already-girlfriend just for drama.

For me, the really annoying trope for Dramione, and really any post-war Hermione-centric fics is killing off Hermione's parents. I feel like there are more stories where Hermione loses her parents than where she gets them back.

*** Yeah it's a bit unfair to single out Dramione... and you're right that it's generally a very common trope in all types of fanfics. The general idea is in any pairing where the love interest is "bad" they need something "worse", so that the bad guy can go "No, that's too far! Oh no, she's a human being after all!". Killing off her parents follows the same formula.

************* Where is the double standard?

Most of the HP fanfiction is about Harry. You can find almost any characterization of him just because of the number of the stories.

If you want weak Harry, a good chunk of HHr stories are about him being a doormat under Hermione's foot.

But it's not true about Hermione. A lot less authors write about her and because 90% of fanfiction stories are bad, there're very few of them where she's just a human with strong and weak sides.

As result there're two opposing camps: the first is damsel in distress and the second is BAMF. With almost nothing in the middle.

************** If you want something in the middle, read all the slice of life stories. But if you have a story about heroes fighting villains, a protagonist either becomes a hero or turns into a damsel in distress - or is a side character, not a protagonist. If you're fighting the worst Dark Lord in Britain's history, you either shape up or become irrelevant - moral support, research robot, damsel in distress, etc.

Most people who complain about female BAMF aren't satisfied until the woman is weak and no longer able to kick ass. No flaws, no weaknesses are enough for them unless the woman starts needing a male hero to save her. Any flaw is waved away as not relevant. Any weakness as cosmetic only.

That doesn't happen nearly as often with male heroes. There, some flaw - hotheaded hero, weakness for girls, angst, whatever - usually is enough to satisfy those readers.

Because for male heroes, BAMF is the default setting.

*************** I won't assume what others think, but for me you don't need to be BAMF to be the hero. Moreover our grandparents, who fought in WW2, or other soldiers in other conflicts aren't BAMFs, but they are Heroes.

In the canon Rowling managed to show just teenagers in the War, but she didn't make them BUMFs, and they are Heroes, because they're human.

Unfortunately very few who see it and even less who can express it on the similar level in their stories.

**************** Soldiers didn't fight Dark Lords, they fought other soldiers. In canon, Harry won through luck, author fiat and a deus ex machina. I'd rather read about a BAMF with no weakness than about such a victory. It feels cheap and convoluted. If people like that - good for them. It's not for me.

No, the default for "strong female hero" seems to be "Mary Sue!" according to the criticism. That's the double standard. People expect a lot more weaknesses from female characters than from male characters.

And no, it's not easy to see when an author isn't serious about their protagonist's flaws. I've had complaints about my characters winning every battle in "Divided and Entwined" even though in all those battles, the characters had overwhelming advantages - they had days or more to prepare, picked the terrain, usually had the initiative as well and were up against unprepared enemies or at least had the defender's advantage. Unless you hand the characters the idiot ball or simply fudge things, then they can't lose such a battle. But that meant that the first time they had to enter a battle without much preparations, in unfamiliar terrain, they suffered greatly and the flaws - limited experience, dependency on set-piece battles - of the leader took effect. And the same happened later in a similar situation. But since they weren't acting like idiots, it took some time before they were forced into such a battle for the first time.

Further, some flaws simply don't matter much in some stories. Where for example, Hermione's tendency to nag people is a flaw, and could lead to trouble in a typical school drama, it isn't actually a flaw in a war story if she's a leader. As anyone in the army can tell, soldiers, especially recruits and green ones, tend to be lazy, and the noncoms and officers need to prod them - nag them - so they don't start to cut corners and your APC breaks down in the middle of the field, or you find that half the barrels of your M2 are rusted through.

It's strange, because BAMF is sort of deus ex machina no one can stand against.

Rowling let Harry win, but still he lost literally everything for that. Yes, her way is illogical, but let's be honest: there's no logical way for teenagers to win against the Dark Lord. This is something we have to accept, because without it there wouldn't be any HP books.

#+begin_quote

In stories about "Garry Sue" or BAMF Harry I saw a lot of comments about him being too perfect.

May people want to see he female side. What't is the point, if in the story "Hermione" can be replaced by "Herman" without affecting anything?

#+begin_quote

And therefore they are cosmetic.

Character flaws may not affect the main plot significantly, but they play big role in character interactions. In your example it's alright when an officer to nag a green recruits, but if the same officer tries to do the same with another officer, or his/her fried, or spouse, the result should be absolutely different. If it doesn't happen, the author isn't serious about this flaw.

****************** They don't want to see her female side - they want to see her weak side. That's the issue. You don't even realise how sexist your argument about replacing her with "Herman" is.

You shouldn't quote Moltke if you don't have any idea what the quote actually means and where it applies to. It doesn't mean that every plan goes to hell, or that every ambush will fail - quite the contrary. There's nothing worse for military or other fiction than some shitty "no matter how stupid, they need a loss here, or it's not dramatic enough!" But, as I said - they didn't win everything anyway; I simply had them suffer losses when it was both logical and appropriate in the story.

Or, you know, people simply tolerate flaws because they have more important things to worry about. Much drama seems so convoluted and forced, like Indy!Harry blowing up at Ron for being jealous for a week or so, after risking their lives together for years. Some people simply want to see the female hero have a breakdown, cry and be emotional (and need a strong male shoulder to cry on), and everything else is "cosmetic."

I would recommend Rebuilding - it's long and deals with some heavy stuff but oh so good. I also LOVE The Die but I'm not sure if it's still up online? The Wrong Strain is an awesome trope subversion, and The Green Girl is a great take on Slytherin Hermione.

if you're looking for more recs I also suggest anything by olivieblake (especially Ride or Die, and, for a much slower burn, Nobility).

I've also got a non-rapey marriage law (shockingly uncommon!) fic called Don't Take This Sinner, if you're into that.

*** I mean, I applaud you for not falling into using rape as a way to get Hermione and Draco together, you simply rehashed canon, forced Hermione into Slytherin, even though nothing about her fits the Slytherin mindset, then simply bashed Ron and Harry for the rest of the story while ripping straight from the original book. Not only that but in the very first two chapters, you pretty much raped anything that goes with Slytherin.

I mean, Salazar Slytherin didn't have a basilisk to purge the school of Mudbloods... nope! We accept everyone! You're one of us, Hermione, and now we all love you! We're misunderstood, don't you get it? The rest of the school thinks we're evil, even though we are because I seem to repeat everything the book version of me said! God, Draco, so smart and witty!

Oh, look, the same, bland, boring plot just changed to move a Slytherin Hermione, who doesn't even act like a Slytherin, she's just superficial arm candy for Draco to fulfil your obvious wank-fest for her.

I mean... yeah...

I would prefer the rape fics, honestly. Less cringe, more original content.

P.S: Yes, I am annoyed by all this crap about Hermione and nonsense when the same authors that attempt to defend it do even worse shit. The only way for Draco and Hermione to work is if you change everything. You cannot rehash fucking canon and have it work. That's piss-poor writing.

**** Because there are many (not I) who would say there are a limited few cases where torture would be permissible (the classic "guy setup a nuke in the city and you're on a limited time table" argument). Rape is just literally unjustifiable, it can't even serve a further purpose that you could defend morally. It's intended to dominate someone by twisting what's supposed to be an intimate experience.

I mean, stories can incorporate it but nearly all of them fail to do anything beyond drama where the antagonist is made to be truly irredeemable (also often mixed with the assumption the woman is now "damaged goods") or to to show the hero in good light as he gets revenge for the raped woman.

Lots of stories cover people dealing with the murder of loved ones (I'd like less revenge murder sprees though, heh), many also do so for prisoners of war who were tortured. Not many do so for victims of rape dealing with their rape, that is often treated as something that the other characters react to as opposed to the victim having to live with and get passed themselves.

Here, to illustrate, I will use the same example you proposed: nuke in the city. There's a nuke in the city, to get the information to disarm it, you threaten to rape the perp/associates of the perp/family of the perp. Boom. Rape is a form of torture. It's that simple. It is no better or worse than gouging someone's eyes out. It's all equally bad.

To your second point: yes, I can see stories using it as a lazy mechanism, poorly written, to move the plot. That doesn't mean it can't be written well or that it should be avoided at all costs.

So is torture - turns out that people are just as likely to feed you a plausible lie as the truth, to stop the pain, and if you don't accept their answer and stop the torture after they give you the actual truth, they'll "confess" whatever they think you want to hear and will make you stop torturing them.

********** *Hanns Scharff*

Hanns-Joachim Gottlob Scharff (December 16, 1907 -- September 10, 1992) was a German Luftwaffe interrogator during the Second World War. He has been called the "Master Interrogator" of the Luftwaffe and possibly all of Nazi Germany; he has also been praised for his contribution in shaping U.S. interrogation techniques after the war. As an Obergefreiter he was charged with interrogating German-captured American fighter pilots during the war after he became an interrogation officer in 1943. He has been highly praised for the success of his techniques, in particular because he never used physical means to obtain the required information.

IIRC, stats show that /well trained/ interrogators can guess something more like 10% better than random chance (55-45), but estimated themselves as more like 80/20 or 90/10. Basically, you /can/ get better-than-random intel, but it's /nearly/ useless, and not something you want to bet peoples' lives on. And in /practice/, torturers at e.g. Guantanamo aren't even trained - it's basically "I'm going to hit you with this wrench until you tell me stuff". They aren't even psychologists.

Yeah sorry, I have to agree with Boris here. Making such a blanket statement is not right. Torture can have incredible traumatizing psychological effects. Making any kind of judgment call which of both is 'worse' for a person to endure in the long run seems unwise.

Why would you claim that after being tortured you'd just have to repair the physical damage and you're fine? Have you heard of waterboarding? There's near zero physical damage and it's horrifying. Do you think people just have to get over being repeatedly drowned for hours on end? Would you say the same to a rape victim ("just get over it!")? I know you wouldn't. Surely torture victims experience similar feelings of helplessness by being at the mercy of their torturer.

Having a finger cut off isn't automatically torture. Experimenting with torture is very dangerous, but people quickly realize that just being bound and utterly helpless (until they use a safe word) can have an incredibly debilitating effect on the psyche.

[[https://youtu.be/17DhRkeNJMY?t=314]]

It's up to the specific situation there. Depends on the individual. And it's all equally terrible.

Regarding your viewpoint on Hermione: I fully agree. I see her character as exactly the same way. But, having her turn vengeful, dark and sadistic should not preclude the need for emotional healing.

In no way does canon establish this. Half of why I think Hermione and Draco and so on get so much coverage is because we don't get the same sort of mental insight into their characters. We can see Harry confused when Draco is pale and skittish all of a sudden, or surprised when Hermione occasionally cries, but Rowling has only captured 7 /adolescent/ years from primarily one perspective. Which is partially why I think the better fics that deal with the fall out of torture, rape, war, etc. are when the characters are older. Because most children aren't going to be reacting to things like rape, near death experiences, etc. like expected because they're not even able to fully process trauma yet.

Frankly, it's unrealistic to say any of the surviving characters wouldn't have some elements of trauma.

Because, as was said, some people do believe there are a few instances where it is, but will deny that rape has any such exceptions.

Because rape doesn't have, on almost anyone's view, exception cases where it's morally permissible. If torture is permissible, then rape in particular just becomes gratuitous.

Rough statistics say 1 in 6 women and 1 in 20 men will be raped or sexually assaulted in their lifetime. Rape has a distressingly high rate of PTSD resulting from it and there have been multiple public cases where rapists have gotten off with a slap on the wrist in punishment, if anything.

Of the two, rape or sexual assault is the one that most readers and writers are more likely to have experienced or know someone who has experienced it. And it is far, far more likely to be used as 'generic tragic backstory' for women. It's also far, far more likely to be badly written.

***** Rape and Hermione are canon...^{^{What}} ^{^{do}} ^{^{you}} ^{^{think}} ^{^{those}} ^{^{Centaurs}} ^{^{did}} ^{^{to}} ^{^{Umbridge?}}

However, having Hermione get raped is just sooo unnecessary. I mean, the girl went through some "quality time" with Bellatrix Lestrange and came out slightly worse for wear. Do you really think that generic "Death Eater rapist" can do worse than Bellatrix "I turned a pair of Aurors into Vegetables and got of from it" Lestrange? (Or that he won't get incinerated by accidental/wandless magic?)

If you want Hermione dealing with trauma, just use that instead of piling even more shit on her plate because at some point it becomes comical rather than tragical (and not the funny type of comedy, but the cringeworthy one).

And even if she was raped, she would rather track down every person her rapist ever cared about and become Hermione the Impaler than become an angsty, scared woman. The girl was nearly killed by a monster snake and shrugged it off, she was tortured, fought in several engagements and was crucial to winning a civil war at age 18. Having her raped might lead to a dark path, but one that makes Voldemort look like a schoolyard bully rather than turn her into the helpless victim.

***** I really wish people wouldn't say "it's like Anne Frank/Hitler". That's a grossly offensive and disrespectful comparison to make, and I've seen people use that same line to attack people who are doing nothing but wanting to stay in their lane.

Case in point, someone wanted me to explain why I shipped young Tom Riddle and Hermione on [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]]. I was nothing but positive, and I never attack anyone (even if I don't like their 'ship), but that didn't stop people from spouting "you're a Nazi, because that's like shipping Anne Frank with Hitler" at me.

Not to mention fiction =\= reality. People who claim that 'shippers can't understand this concept, or stereotype them as "just doing it because he's hot", seem to be just as much at fault as those they claim to disagree with, in that sense.

Too many people forget that these are fictional characters, whereas Anne Frank and Hitler were real people. It's offensive to use such a comparison to me, because I feel that it's a massive, false equivalence. It's inherently disrespectful of the suffering that millions of people (Anne Frank included) went through, as well as tarnishing the horrific scope and real-life impact of the atrocities that Hitler caused.

But you know what saying things like "you're as bad as a Nazi for liking that" does affect? Real people. Real people who just want to enjoy their fictional characters and pairings in peace.

I've seen so many people say things like "getting a Dark Mark tattoo is like getting a swastika tattoo, and makes you a Nazi" on [[/r/HarryPotter][r/HarryPotter]]. It's time to stop using Nazi comparisons, fandom policing, and let people just enjoy what they want to enjoy. If they want to 'ship Hermione with a Death Eater, or get a Dark Mark tattoo, then let them. It affects no one but themselves.

Unless they're actual Neo-Nazis...which I personally have yet to see happen...then don't tell people they're Nazis, or compare their pairing to "Anne Frank with Hitler". Just block the tag, or ignore and move on. Simple as that.

Also, no amount of non-canon 'shipping will change the fact that Hermione ends up with Ron in canon. That's just fact.

I could say the same for those criticizing "dark" Hermione pairings. I'm not going to just going to "keep my opinions to myself" when people are treating others in a disrespectful way, simply for happening to have (or like) unpopular ideas. To stay silent is to allow people's unacceptable behavior to continue unchallenged.

And I do, indeed, believe that commenting something like "you're disgusting / a Nazi for liking X pairing" to someone, who is clearly happy and likes X pairing, is rude, offensive, and disrespectful. The same goes for Dark Mark tattoos.

Also, in my view, the mentality (in general) of "maybe you just just stay quiet" isn't being fair, or considerate, of people with different opinions. It's not giving those who disagree a chance to explain how, and why, they do so, and to explain their point of view. And saying something like "shipping Hermione with Y character is like pairing Anne Frank with Hitler" is also completely dismissing the other person's opinion, even referring or equating it with being "bad" or "evil", without asking /why/.

In other words, it's a knee-jerk reaction that doesn't bother to actually seek to understand the situation more. Disagreement is fine, but the implications of the line I pointed out (the one about Anne Frank) is more so trying to shut someone down, and strawman their position, then actually taking the time and effort to fully (civilly) rebut their position.

Firstly, expressing a desire that "I wish people wouldn't do X" isn't claiming that people "can't" do something, They can do whatever they please, but I wish they wouldn't. They tend to forget that there's another person on the other side of the screen.

Secondly, I've studied WWII history, particularly in the case of getting historical accuracy right for Tom Riddle's character in the WWII era. No matter how much people claim that "Death Eater and Voldemort = Nazis and Hitler", or how popular an idea it is...it simply isn't the case. Rowling herself also notably got some things blatantly wrong about WWII and German history, including her claiming in an interview that Hitler was "half-Jewish" (he wasn't; this was something put out by Allied propaganda at the time).

This is why I mentioned people's tendency to draw false comparisons and equivalence between two things, especially WWII and /Harry Potter/. While they appear similar on the surface, the two are /extremely/ different in terms of context.

And, as always, context is always important. I'm going to quote a source as to why.

#+begin_quote
  The premise is quite clear as to how vital context is: without context, we immediately jump in our heads to what we want to say next, based on the very first few words we hear from the other person.
#+end_quote

In this case, people have a tendency to (falsely) equate Deather Eaters and such with Nazism, saying they're the same. But they're /not/ the same...because the contexts in the two scenarios are completely different. As the saying goes, /"The Devil is in the detail"./

Also:

#+begin_quote
  *Contexts, however, are not static, but fluid and dynamic*,with important repercussions for both formal and informal learning experiences.

****** I don't see how it's grossly offensive.

Allegorical and metaphorical connections are made all the time from the reader of fiction to real life situations, many of which do involve WWII and Hitler. Finding a connection between fantasy and reality isn't something that inherently tarnishes the impact of reality, in a lot of cases it makes it something tangible that someone who wasn't in those circumstances could understand.

As for making this specific comparison, it does make sense. Hermione is a character who is apart of a minority being oppressed by a powerful political movement who would gladly see her "put in her place" or worse dead. Death Eaters as a whole believe in the superiority of the blood that runs through their veins. It's a fairly obvious historical connection.

This is the great thing about fiction though, we can put characters in unusual scenarios without necessarily agreeing with dogma coming from the characters.

People who are calling you a nazi are probably wrong (I don't actually know you so I can't say what your ideology is), but the idea that we shouldn't as the audience be able to interpret a story in our own way is wrong as well.

If you really want to avoid having people make connections like that you simply have to change the characters histories so the interpretation isn't really available to those who actually read and understand the story.

  I don't see how it's grossly offensive.
#+end_quote

I find it offensive for the same reasons that some people thought that John Greene writing the main characters kissing in the Anne Frank house in /The Fault in Our Stars/ found said scene to be offensive:

#+begin_quote
  First, Justin Bieber elicited scorn for hoping Anne Frank would be a 'belieber,' then Beyonce was criticized for posting photos of herself from Frank's house in Amsterdam, and now box-office hit "The Fault in Our Stars" has left many scratching their heads for its use of the Holocaust landmark in a crucial kiss scene.

  The young-adult movie, based on John Green's 2012 book by the same name, shows cancer-stricken protagonist Hazel (Shailene Woodley) and Augustus (Ansel Elgort) inside the Anne Frank House --- on a recreated set in Pittsburgh --- sharing their first kiss, after a frail Hazel manages to breathlessly climb the stairs to the attic. Tourists around them break into applause.

  It was this juxtaposition of a couple sharing a deeply intimate moment with cheering strangers set against a solemn historic backdrop that rubbed most film reviewers the wrong way.

  "The film may get away with using cancer to tug the heartstrings, but combining cancer and the Holocaust is at least one trigger too many,” wrote Andrew Barker of Variety.

  Richard Corliss of /Time/ calls the scene "where a Jewish girl's descent into the Holocaust is straight-facedly compared to a teen's cancer," "egregious."

  [...] BuzzFeed's Ariane Lange and another colleague engaged in a thorough debate on the topic last week, with Lange taking issue with the fact that the two characters don't discuss Frank or how she died while inside the museum. Instead, Frank's story becomes a backdrop, a metaphor for suffering.

  "I don't think that human suffering should be a metaphor,” Lange told NBC News, adding: "I don't think that being murdered is the same thing as dying of cancer." [[https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/movies/kiss-anne-frank-attic-did-fault-our-stars-go-too-n129116][(Source)]]

  "I guess I could say I felt the same way --- I also didn't read the book until after seeing the movie, and I only read the book *to try to comprehend the movie's ahistorical and callous treatment of Anne Frank*. I read the book looking for some kind of explanation, because it felt so out of place in the movie.

  Geographically, you're right; it makes sense. But they go to her house without really talking about her, or what happened to her. They don't really talk about her once they're inside the house. Lidewij says Otto was the only one to survive, and that's the end of the discussion. *Anne Frank in this movie is this cipher --- they don't talk about her history or how she died. She's just a metaphor for suffering, and I walked out of the theater angry, and I've been angry about it ever since.*"

  "I totally agree that it was a tad extreme of a comparison, and the Holocaust should never be spoken about lightly..."

  "I think saying they were 'dealt unfair cards' is a bizarre way of looking at it, to be honest. That seems to be what John Green thinks as well. (Since he and the filmmakers had no comment when I reached out to them, I tried to find other things he'd said about her.) An interviewer asked why Anne Frank was in the book, and Green said, 'Anne Frank was a pretty good example of a young person who ended up having the kind of heroic arc that Augustus wants --- she was remembered and she left this mark that he thinks is valuable --- but when he has to confront her death, he has to confront the reality that really she was robbed of the opportunity to live or die for something. She just died of illness like most people.' She just died of illness like most people. I*t's a callous view of the past*, and it really hits home in what you see in both the novel and the film: *The particulars of Anne Frank's death are less important than the vague idea of her suffering, and it's a disgrace to her memory.*

  ... they do not share her story. They don't talk in any detail about her life, and they don't talk in any detail about her death. And, I imagine, *this is because the metaphor would quickly fall apart if we actually confronted Green's assertion* that Anne Frank 'just died of illness like most people'.

  [...] She's not a metaphor for All People Who Die Young: She's a real, historic person who was murdered, and to say, "She, like Hazel and Augustus, is a person who died young but still lived a meaningful life" robs her memory of its true meaning, which is that this slaughter, Shoah, was a senseless tragedy, the result of deliberate evil.

  Lidewij says "Anne Frank," and the audience is just supposed to understand. And what we're supposed to understand is not "a teenager's emaciated body lying on the freezing ground in a pile of corpses." We're supposed to understand, "Ah, yes, Anne Frank, died young, very sad."

  *Cancer is heartbreaking, but it is not a genocide; it is not an organized mass murder, and to compare the two erases the intentional aspect of genocide.*

  [...] I don't know how recently you've read her diary, but I think to say Anne Frank made the best of a "bad situation" is not really accurate. She was just a regular teenager --- like, a huge part of her diary is devoted to how mad she is at her mom. *Anne Frank, the individual, is propped up as this sort of heroine, but that does a disservice to the memory of Shoah (the Holocaust)*.

  And the fact that Hazel and Augustus decide to kiss in the annex really underlines *that they don't think of this as a monument to human suffering; they think of it as this uplifting, carpe-diem place*. In the book, Hazel, the narrator, says she was "thinking that you cannot kiss anyone in the Anne Frank House, and then thinking that Anne Frank, after all, kissed someone in the Anne Frank House, and that she would probably like nothing more than for her home to have become a place where the young and irreparably broken sink into love."

  *She knows it's inappropriate, and then she clearly aligns herself with Anne Frank, and again, ignoring the actual circumstances of Anne Frank's death, she takes it upon herself to speculate as to what Anne Frank would have wanted.* Oh, Anne Frank, she loved love. So what you're saying, I think, is true: The book and the movie do take Anne Frank's house to be a place of inspiration for you to 'live your best life today,' and the reason they're able to do that *is because they don't take into account any of the Franks' actual stories*.

  [...] As for the victims, my point is that to call them heroes, to my mind, imbues their suffering with a higher purpose that I think is counterproductive. *Calling Anne Frank a hero takes something away from her*: She was a regular teenager who was murdered. It wasn't dignified, and it wasn't heroic, and that is what happened. *To remember it as heroic, I think, distorts it. It distorts the evil that actually occurred. And it's that kind of thinking that allows Anne Frank to be used as a prop.*

  [...] *To me, what would have been really great would be if Green didn't use Anne Frank as an empty metaphor. Or if the book and the movie weren't completely ahistorical.*" [[https://www.buzzfeed.com/arianelange/anne-frank-the-fault-in-our-stars?utm_term=.doYW0zaKMY#.yoa67PLn23][(Source)]]

You keep responding with very little in the ways of plurality. Not EVERYONE is going to interpret the same things from an artists work.

Some people are going to see the historical connection and appreciate the creator for keeping them in the conversation, others are going to accuse the creator of misusing history.

A creator can rarely choose the way someone is going interpret their work, even if they'd prefer others didn't. JRR Tolkien disliked the idea of his work being allegorical for anything, yet all you have to do is search for a few seconds and you'll have a ton of pages about how LOTR's is an allegory for one of the World Wars. Darren Aronofsky with his movie Mother has a specific allegorical connection in mind with the environment, yet the audiences created their own anyways.

I don't find it offensive because it's audience interpretation. I can't seem to find it disgusting that someone sees things in a specific way. If you're a creator of any piece of work you simply have to accept that people are going to interpret the work in whatever way they decide to.

  Godwin's Law does not dispute the validity or otherwise of references or comparison to Hitler or the Nazis. As such a comparison or reference may sometimes be appropriate in a discussion, Godwin has argued that overuse of the Nazi comparison should be avoided as it waters down the impact of any valid usage. In its purest sense, the rule has more to do with completely losing one's sense of proportion rather than just mentioning Nazis specifically.[3][4] The law was initiated as a counter-meme to flippant comparisons to the Nazis, rather than to invoke a complete ban on comparisons.

**** For me, that's what it is when I do put in aspects of the plot that deal with sexual assault and abuse (child, domestic, whatever). It's me trying to outlet everything in my head over my own experiences with these things. It's like getting to...go back in time and write what I should have done, and would have done, and how I would have reacted better, or faster, or just been brave or strong enough to just stand up and yell to the world what was happening to me every day of my life. But I never did that, but I can at least make sure my characters get to do that for themselves.

Unlike the authors in this thread that are mentioned as being disrespectful and extreme about handling these plots, I don't think I am about it. I mean, even as a survivor I think it's impossibly hard to write down, to get across, to actually do and keep it...respectful and all that. But I'm trying anyway.

I think I'm doing okay with that. I don't make them the sole purpose of the plot, I don't use them to get people together, and they don't DOMINATE the whole rest of the plot threads I have going in my stories. They're just events and aspects in decades of a person's life, and even if the after effects do stay forever, they don't become their whole world. All that there is about them, or who they are. Like it doesn't me.

But anyway, these plot points, these events, they're there still, and I sort of need them to be there if I'm not going to go crazy in my own head here.

I've definitely read Snamiones that handled rape well (for both Hermione and/or Snape), and I'm conflicted because as an assault survivor, I admittedly like a Hermione that's dealt with my own shit. Bloodcult of Freud's "Tyger, Tyger" struck me as a fic that dealt with assault well because she literally wrote what I had thought and felt myself. It's just so rarely handled well in Tomione and Dramione. But then I spoiled myself reading Pygmalion as my first Tomione, haha (also the fic that got me interested in the pairing!).

** Tropes are tools. Don't blame the tool for its misuse. If the sort of people writing stories in which there's a gratuitous rape scene instead write a different scene, that different scene will still have a very low expected literary value. The only thing norms against scenes like this accomplish are making the constraints of the audience's moral acceptability tighter for legitimately talented writers. Legitimately talented writers have a very legitimate need to push the envelope and tell stories about things that are especially dark or unusual and I don't want to see them discouraged from doing that in an attempt to sanitize fiction. Don't like don't read should remain our rule of thumb.

I hate Dramione, so it's not like I'm speaking up out of self-interest in a favored ship or story here. I just think that when morality gets mixed with art it usually makes art worse, and don't want posts like this to form a beachhead for some kind of broader shift. Harry Potter is many things, but often it's a story about good and evil, and I don't want to see the possibility of depictions of evil go away. And I get that nobody's calling for censorship or anything, but writers getting unfair bashing or social ostracism is a real thing that leads to incentivizing writers to be more vanilla and more boring.

The problem is that this doesn't exist in a bubble. There are literally teen girls reading this stuff and thinking it's real. Or worse, romantic.

I've written rape before and I'm careful not to make it “sexy” for just this reason.

When I talked about the urge to sanitize fiction, your mindset is exactly what I had in mind. I don't think it's necessary or desirable to try to minimize the risk anyone ever will be influenced negatively by a story. The only stories that avoid such risks are those that are safe and boring.

My feelings on fridging women are the same as my feelings on rape as a dramatic moment. The problem is never with the trope itself, only with particular deployments of that trope. Attacking the trope itself won't make bad writers any better. Some stories about how the death of a loved one influences a male protagonist are worth telling, and even made more powerful by inclusion of the trope.

I have few moral squicks when it comes to fiction simply because it's not real. No one is actually hurt if you write that Hermione gets raped, but even then, rape affects people differently. I imagine Hermione (based on her character) to overcompensate after sexual assault. She'd withdraw and try to fix her problems all by herself. She'd throw herself into studying. She would absolutely not dissolve into tears and be incapable of functioning unless some Dude was around to drape herself over.

That honestly sounds more like Lavender Brown.

I'm not sure how to interpret your earlier reference to teen girls who might see stories like this and think they're describing something real except as a desire to sanitize fiction.

Having said that, I agree with you that it'd be desirable for beginning writers to reconsider whether adding rape to the story improves its artistic quality, and to consider other possibilities. But I think that because I want stories to be entertaining, rather than because I think it's immoral for them to include rape. And I think even amateurish, non-artistic depictions of rape could be forgivable if they ultimately lead a writer to becoming less amateurish.

For me, the best thing about fanfiction is that it's a sandbox in which people can play with and deconstruct traditional ideas, taking them to unfamiliar places, or making familiar places seem strange. I'm afraid of efforts to make fanfiction a highly moral sphere because I think they'll reduce the diversity of different interpretations that authors can explore, when that variety is one of fanfiction's greatest strengths.

** I will start by saying that the world isn't a nice place full of rainbows and unicorns. Bad things, including sexual assault, do happen on a regular basis. Sometimes, they are predictable - for example, a man with historic temper issues and alcoholism stabs and kill his wife after she was caught cheating him. Sometimes, they are not - a girl is walking in broad daylight on a peaceful street and suddenly a man jumps on her, resulting in her rape. I am not saying that these acts (rape, murder, theft) are justifiable, quite the opposite. We, humans, instinctively know these things are wrong because they violate the Natural Law and the principle of non-aggression. Even so, these acts do happen. Some fictional writers reflect and use the real world as a basis on their writing, J.K. Rowling included. We see this in HP in various situations - the house elf issue, Voldemort's ideology, a complex and big State with various departments, monetary system based on metals and so on. It isn't hard to imagine that a world as similar as our own would have the same issues, so it's also natural for these crimes against humanity to exist in them - hence the reason for the Auror Corporation to exist or the war and the killings. Now that we concluded that they do happen on the Wizard World, the question remains. Should we, as writers, write about it? The answer is quite simple. If you want to do it, you do it. If you don't, you don't. I'll elaborate. You are not violating any Natural Law or harming anyone by writing about it - you could even argue that you are helping bring the issue up. Alas, I digress. The point is we cannot censor the stories that involve rape because the authors are in their domain and they are not harming anyone - the same goes for other issues such as under age sex and so on. You can boycott it if you find it offensive or simply don't like it, but again, you cannot absolutely prohibit someone from writing about it because that person is not violating anything. As you argue, we are in our right to criticize it to pieces if the rape isn't necessary to the plot - we can do it even if it is necessary. The point still remains - we cannot prohibit someone from writing about it or reading about it. My advice? Don't read fanfics like that, leave a nasty review if you do or downvote those fic search treads with these elements. But do not ever try to prohibit someone from searching about a story that contain it. That's just censorship.

** Yes, please. Ditto Harmonians that have her be raped by Ron and/or WBWL!Neville.

More broadly, I seem to recall reading---though I can't find the source, despite googling some things I /really/ should not have googled---that the trope of the heroine being raped at the start of a romance novel was common as far back as the Victorian Era. It was a way around the traditional gender roles and expectations. In short,

1. A romantic plot along the lines of the hero asking the heroine's father's permission to court her, courting her with chaperones, them being duly engaged and married, and both being virgins until their wedding night does not make for an interesting novel. Therefore, the relationship had to involve some transgressions of this idealised procedure.
2. A man who did anything transgressive with a pure woman (i.e., a virgin) would be viewed as a villain corrupting the innocent, unless, perhaps he were equally innocent and pure (e.g., Romeo). Therefore, if the hero were someone more "experienced", the heroine in a romance couldn't be pure.
3. But, neither could the heroine be a scarlet woman, because then it would be viewed as pornography and not romance.
4. Therefore, the heroine had to be "deflowered", but not in any way that reflects on her character.

An easy way to implement this kind of plot is to have the villain of the story rape the heroine, and then have the hero come to her rescue and romance her.

It's been a while, and I couldn't find the source, so I could have gotten some details wrong, and take it with a grain of salt. I wonder to what point this dynamic is still in effect, especially if the fic writer is religious.

I can even get behind whacky stockholm syndrome stories where rapist and victim end up "happily together", IF it's well written and actually uses the available opportunities.

It's so frustrating to see people just throw it in more or less randomly or as an excuse to overwrite a personality with something completely different just so they can keep the visual imagery of having it technically be that person.

--------------

As it stands, similar to lots of other cases of modern story telling, these rape scenes just scream low hanging fruit power fantasy/wish fulfillment with minimal thought put into plot. Just break the characters/set up the protagonist as the ultimate hero to force the desired dynamic in there. Whoo how creative!

Rape is a hot button topic, so people just mash that button until the label peels off. After all, for killing to be impactful we need t first care about the characters, which requires skill. For torture we need context, which requires thought. Rape just works for shock value and low budget empathy without even providing a real scene (or it acts as an excuse to write really gross rape scenes that are obviously power fantasies...)

The biggest red flag is probably if the perpetrator doesn't have prior characterization with a decent level of depth.

  Hermione thanks Malfoy for the stories that weren't. An angsty little canon-compliant fic that came to me while I was musing over particle physics.

** Writing a recovering from Rape story could be good.

Writing a recovering from Rape story as a plot device instead as the plot... bad.

Don't treat it as a way to change a character, treat it with respect. Don't make it a background issue because that just makes it... background. Either it takes over the story and it becomes a story about recovering from emotional and physical trauma...or don't do it...please...

** I am going to say: this thread has a lot of responses perilously close to victim shaming. Strong, smart women a.) get raped and b.) react in "not strong ways" all the time to assault. Hermione getting raped absoutely is an overused trope in many ships, but the issue comes from writers not deftly handling the issue or not delving into the different ways a character like Hermione /could/ react to rape imo. The trope becomes worn when it's just every writer throwing it in for shock value.

**** Not your post specifically, but some of the comments. But a large part of rape culture /is/ actual people hearing some of the commentary that's happening in this thread. These characters are fictional, but actual survivors hearing, "Hermione's too strong/smart to be 'broken' by rape" implies that being hurt or affected by rape is somehow weak or stupid. I'd even argue thinking that anyone should or could bounce back from most trauma based on their personality is troubling.

#+end_quote

I'm not responsible for actual survivors misinterpreting my post and if something like this sets them off they are probably not ready to engage with the topic.

No. What I'm saying is that it is stupid/bad writing to rape her in order to make her weaker, when authors are unable to write a romance with a strong female character. It's quite obvious that I'm not talking about literary award winners who try to portray a realistic and nuanced approach to the psychological consequences and subsequent struggles of rape survivors - this is [[/r/hpfanfiction]]. At worst, if I'm shaming anyone, I'm shaming shitty writers - and not even that was my intent.

#+end_quote

Why would I think this? No one has said this or even anything remotely close to this. Are you projecting or something?

As it comes to Hermione, yeah, I'd expect her to bounce back, but I can also see it going another way. It's not the "being a mess after rape" that I have a problem with, it's "putting rape into a story so I can replace a strong female character with a weaker one who needs male protectors".

Sorry for being so verbose, but I feel like I have to be extra specific now in order to avoid malicious misinterpretations. The next step in your script is usually to call me a rape apologist or something.

I'd check a little better who's projecting here ;)

(P.S. I had upvoted every single comment of yours in here because I agreed with you so much, so I didn't think I was discussing anything worth that diatribe since we seem to be on the same page of "broaching thought." I'm sorry, I still am unsure why you took my comment so personally.)
