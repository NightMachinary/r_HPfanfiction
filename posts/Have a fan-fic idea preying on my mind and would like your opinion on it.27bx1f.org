** If you want to avoid the Mary Sue aspect, remove all mention of talent equal to... anyone.

You want to make her a special case in a way that doesn't conflict with Albus' reticence in directly teaching Harry, then make her a personal challenge for him. For instance, how much harder is it to learn magic if you can't hear or speak? If you choose to go this route, it might make sense to make the circumstance even more exceptional- she looks like Ariana, and has similar issues with control.

The really spooky version: Grindelwald escaped Nurmengard during Voldemort's first rise and cooked her up by using his mad alchemy skills and some of Ariana's hair that had been saved for just such a purpose- to screw with Albus. The headmaster isn't even aware of her until he sees Gellert on his annual visit and the man asks his old friend if Gellert's 'daughter' can come to Hogwarts, now that she must be approaching school age.

Also, to make this relevant but new, I'd suggest placing the girl as older, like Tonks' age so she can interact with Bill, Charlie and others during a time when Albus was only watching Harry from afar.

As [[/u/Bulwersator][u/Bulwersator]] mentioned, it's important if you're going to make a big story out of it to know at least in general how it will end. Otherwise you don't have a goal to write towards. During the writing, you can change the goal or even the purpose, but don't kick it off if you don't have an exit plan..

Understood, I must say I didn't explicitly state that "X ranks even higher than Y in raw magical power" or some such nonsense. It was more of a passing remark from Minerva to Albus "She's astonishingly powerful for her age" (she's around 8 or 9 at this point, and been approached after it is assumed she can control it by herself).

I will be revising my opinion of Minerva (McGonagall) when I re-draft it meticulously. I should add that her being "sensitive" to magic innately - she is quite rare, and thus quite useful to magical establishments (spell making/St Mungo's Magical curses/Tomb raiding (awh yeah, hidden spell manuscripts and all that...).

I'm not even sure it'll be a "she", I was writing a faceless character at first and a female took form and molded best to what I wanted my character to be. I also don't really mention her looks more than in passing generalized ways, describing someone as button-nosed and having hair that fell like golden waterfalls doesn't tickle my fancy.

  The really spooky version
#+end_quote

Gellert is indeed mentioned already in the fic!(passingly) Though due to what we know from the original books, I just can't imagine him as being cruel to a person he grew up with by tainting such a sacred memory (Ariana). It is quite the idea, though will not quite fit into my idea of the plot so far.

Hmm, I had intended the character to be around 10 (but look 13 or so) and start Hogwarts, quite a bit of my more interesting ideas revolve around certain things happening early on before Harry appears.

Harry would hopefully be a passing character, I have ideas that could make the main character be away on interesting errands, curse-breaking and ward-assessing and all that jazz.

I won't neglect the story - it has begun, and I enjoy the hell out of it so far. As I glue in my ideas into the plot I imagine I will get a brief glimpse of the finishing line - though I dare not speculate how that would be so far. I think it will be quite interesting though - I just wouldn't forgive myself if it was anything less than an epic wrapping-up, no matter how long it takes me to think of it, even if I have to re-write large parts and take stuff out to get what I want in the end, I will be content knowing I've justified my even starting the story :)

** I have no experience with writing, and only commenting as an avid reader - treating your comment like I would a story summary/intro if I was considering reading it, and what reactions it would elicit.

1) i've read a few fics that toyed with idea of magical sensitivity including powers like being able to feel enchantments on things/people, being able to identify who cast a spell or placed an enchantment by reading "magical signature", being able to forecast which spells are going to be cast by sensing patterns of magic at time of casting...

In all of them these powers made the MC overpowered and spoiled the story for me - and none of them really used these to their full advantage either.

2) Age-wise be careful about which years/age you choose to focus your story on - young age of MC severely restricts the topics you can plausibly weave into the story and very few authors can pull off a "realistic" kid MC without boring the readers. For example the whole "helping a wizard with centuries of experience in his research" - maybe plausible if MC is being used like a magical microscope and her contribution is describing what colors/patterns she sees. However that's going to be somewhat boring to read. On the other hand a girl pre-Hogwarts so age 10-ish or even a young teen being able to contribute anything else to Dumbles is like having a kid of that age assist Ph.Ds - going to get even more objections than HPMOR did about plausible intellect level of kids.

As age goes up, these "restrictions" disappear for most readers. If you are estimating only 50k story, you probably aren't going to be covering more than one year. For example you mentioned "no slash", meaning you are going to be trying to include some romance/sexual content somewhere in it of the hetero variety - so starting at pre-Hogwarts age 10 for MC might leave you 40k words into the story and still nowhere close to being able to start the romance bits, or really doing any of the "dark and cruel" stuff you mentioned without squicking off a lot of the reader base.

I don't know if you've read Firebird's Son or Grey Maiden story, but these are some examples, besides HPMOR, that come to my mind that involve young MC at age 11 but were still interesting to read without getting too implausible.

3) Stories that try to shuffle a deck full of ideas ending up with "everything but the kitchen sink" usually fail at all of them.

Best stories usually take 1 or 2 deviations from canon and expand on these deviations directly and gradually.

An OC outside perspective on the usual main characters is a good idea.

Magical sensitivity is a potentially good, separate idea.

Dumbledore singling out a young student for extra training is a third good separate idea.

Runes/wards 4th, Europe and and travelling magical world 5th...

that's already quite a lot to juggle together and fully "explore" each one. Any one of these by itself could make a good long story - so if you do 5 of them together, either some of them will feel tacked-on and underused or you are going to have to weave together 5 stories' worth of content. Doable if you are set on writing a long epic. But doing a good story with all of these elements in under 50k words is going be very hard (in fact I have yet to read a story under 50k that handled even half of that number well)

Most of all just remember that all critique/advice represents only a subset of views and it seems that a LOT of people read fanfic - pretty much anything you write is going to appeal to someone out there. So just get yourself into a mindset to disregard any input that impedes your writing and might prevent your story from ever getting written.

*** 1) We've probably read the same fics! I'm hoping I can make a pretty logical explanation for magic, more than simply swish-and-flick and say a word.

2) I would say it's more like a person with vision like the Hubble telescope looking at a petri-dish and saying "there's some colours and stuff", shouldn't be anything remotely impressive - at the start it will be like putting shapes into shape holes, before we move on to more complex things.

The MC will be trained - by different magical beings - specializing in a multitude of things, but she's also lazy and learns only what she likes to (Hermione would put her to shame almost everywhere etc... Hermione is more like a device to introduce complex ideas by "studying" - imo) - it works well within the original story so I'm not quite against it. In my own story, as said before the MC is more complex, thus why I wanted to add "booster" sessions of learning by having time being manipulated (I have a decent idea of how to implement this.)

3) Magical sensitivity will become a device in both runes/wards and travelling, so I try and view that as some kind of individual tale of it's own with the drama and whatnot thrown in to develop and snowball until some likely heroic action occurs... or some great misery is flung at our beloved MC.

I am hoping the magical sensitivity will be seen as /part/ of the MC (much like Harry's connection with LV), the travelling expands the plot and introduces newer ideas as well as expanding on those already briefly mentioned (such as runes and wards etc...). Oh yeh - did I mention I wanted to have a more thorough look at Gringotts bank?... and Diagon Alley is getting a relatively huge makeover...

I appreciate your answer though, it helped immensely in judging how subtle and creative I'll have to be to make this all come together realistically.

** I'll just give you some general advice just on reading your ideas here.

- You need a plot. You have a lot of ideas for your MC, but if you base everything around your MC, you will quickly abandon your story. You're going to need a plot. A beginning, middle, and end. Other characters. All of the details don't have to be filled in, but the worst thing you can do is create your main character and have nothing else. Lots of good ideas about runes and time travel manipulation but these are just ideas. Whenever you first start penning your fic, you need to have more than just a main character and things you want your main character to do. The ideas with runes and time manipulation are just background things. Ideas that set the rules for the world. They are not the actual plot.

- I'd strongly suggest aging your characters. First year rewrites are boring. Eleven year olds talking and holding grand conversations with Dumbledore are implausible at best. Dumbledore teaches, he mentors. Your MC might have other ideas, but for the most part, your MC will listen and absorb.

- Just give it a shot. If this is your first fic, you're going to look back at it and hate yourself. You're never going to get better if you don't write. Ask for feedback, negative and positive. Ignore the trolls but don't mistake everyone as a troll. You can only get better

*** I have a pretty good idea of an ending - one that would amount to a wasteland scenario (complex factions coming to blows) - Beautiful phoenix's arise from ashes and all that tripe...

Even so - I have a multitude of lined paper at my disposal to creating charming plot-progression graphs.

***** On the other hand your changes better make sense

For example I read this Female!Harry fic last year it started nice and stuff made sense (how she was treated by everyone etc.) but then when Harry reaches hogwarts she can't do magic because (i don't remember but I remember it not making sense) the author didn't explain how harry becoming a girl made him unable to use magic, then dumbledore teaches her occulmancy, and her eyes become like emeralds or some bullshit... i dropped it right there.

****** Pahahahahaha

Gemstone descriptions for eyes are /so/ last year.

I don't want to lavish my main character (MC) with descriptions, I'm hoping a vague description will be enough to fuel the reader into creating their own image.

Even now I thought of three ways that he could lose his magic via dick-girl transformation.

1) Male!Harry used his entire magical core to change gender permanently.

2) Male!Harry was naturally weak in magic, and women are less magically powerful (for some reason), thus "she" loses the dregs of magic "he" had in him.

3) His ability to control his magic was destroyed the moment he started thinking of himself a girl, with "him" not being "him" anymore etc...

My story is not even really a Harry Potter story, it's more of a brief look into Harry Potter, and perhaps some interference throughout, though should mostly be a stand-alone, independent of the main story-line.

**** It won't be abandoned.

I wouldn't have created this thread had I not had some measure of ... confidence - in my ability to finish it.

Funnily enough it started out in the another story I had in my head - where the main character is just in awe of the magical world - and it would end with platform 9.75 ... but it got kinda out of hand, so that main idea snowballed into a massive collective of ideas that I thought would work quite well together.

*** My first idea of this meeting was to do with preparing defenses for the Philosophers Stone, which will not be as in the original timeline (really, flying keys?)

Quirrel will be quite interesting, though to my dismay I don't think he should become a genius - merely a semi-capable stuttering mess - with ulterior motives obviously...

How the main character finds the two elder wizards is quite one of my better ideas for the story, I don't know how Flamel will fit into the story, I don't think I want him to be more than a very intelligent, intensely private man (he's just too interesting as a character to avoid completely).

I'm focusing more on Dumbledore the man, and the genius wizard. I will expand on why he is "the only one you-know-who" feared.

*** I have three ideas as how to start it; Very dark, dark, and somewhat light. The age of the MC I thought would best create sympathy for the character, there are a few ideas with time manipulation that would age her beyond her years. I have only a few ideas for relationships, and they are mostly ...tragic - a device to destroy young naivete also.

#+begin_quote
  I would have difficulty believing in an 11 year old developing new magics without you portraying her as a super genius.
#+end_quote

As do I!

Which is why she will have a remarkable amount of experience, and spend a lot less time in Hogwarts. She'll be pretty intelligent, and have a huge interest in warding and protecting people - due to one of my more friendly plot twists...

There is also an idea floating around for speeding her aging by a few years - it fits well with what I had planned to happen in the story.

In addition to that... it's like imagining a snooker player who can see the required trajectory of the ball before he takes a shot... or something, all she needs to know is what the things she sees means, then the hardest part is building a foundation of knowledge about it all.

#+begin_quote
  As a reader, the primary reason why I will stop reading a fic midway is when characters seem implausible for their age.
#+end_quote

I won't have it online until I'm confident with it, and have had a couple people I know read it.

Even as I write this I have many tabs open that I'm learning from to make my own portrayal of the child appear more authentic and natural. I imagine it will take three to four revisions until I'm satisfied. I don't begin the first major and complete revision until I have around 40,000 words (at 10,000 now). If I really enjoy it and think it's a charming story by then, then I might just make it a shorter story and not include other stuff. If not I'll continue as scheduled :)

#+begin_quote
  Another issue that could arise is the relationship with Dumbledore and how that affects the other interactions with characters. I can't really see justifying a a very personal relationship between the two and Dumbledore showing such interest in her if she isn't some kind of prodigy, but then it can difficult for her have 'normal' interactions with other students and such.
#+end_quote

Instead of a "prodigy" or "gifted", a more appropriate term would be "freak of nature", something massively rare. Thus Dumbledore is curious, and will help her moderately - they will develop a bond like teacher / student. Normal interactions with other students will be minimal in my opinion. I hope she turns out normal in the end, as the story seems to write itself despite my nudging.
