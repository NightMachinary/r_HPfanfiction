Solved! TY

So last night at 4am I was reading a fic I found on my phone from the front page about harry having a potions accident that turns him into fem!harry. He goes by Lilly until claiming the Heir of Slytherin title in the chamber of secrets and then becomes Lilith Alice Potter then later gets adopted by Sirius after she frees him from Prison and becomes his Heir to avoid getting married off to a man because shes in love with Hermione.

Trouble is My phone updated for some unknown reason and now I cant find the fic anywhere. Searched for 2 hours and now im asking for help! I knew I should have took a pic of the title and finished the last 2 chapters. oWo

  Harry's troubled life is further complicated when his sex is changed due to a shoddy potion and a rebounding blood seal, she is the only one not surprised at this turn of events, blasted Potter luck. Now known as Lilly follow her as she embraces her new found freedom and powers as she and her friends toy with the world, for she solemnly swears she is up to no good. A rewrite.
