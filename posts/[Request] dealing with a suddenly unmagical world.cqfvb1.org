Any kind of fic works, as long as the premise Is "There was Magic Yesterday. Today, it's +fine+" gone.


** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm][This one]] kinda fits your premise.

This follows Hermione in a non-magical alternate universe. I read it without reading the author's other works and enjoyed it. But if you don't like Hermione /at all/, don't read it.

**** You won't be disappointed, and I think this is his best fic yet.

Hermione has so far met this world's Grangers, Harry, Ron, Amelia Bones, Scrimgeour, Yaxley, Luna, and Dumbledore. Luna is a very fun, and Dumbledore is a very interesting character.

  It seemed like a routine assignment for CI5 officers Ron Weasley and Harry Potter: Investigate a physicist who had caught the attention of some unsavoury elements. Little did they know that Dr Hermione Granger would turn out to have more secrets than Ron would have thought possible.

** I'm trying to remember the name of a fic. There was a zombie apocalypse in Britain, and also magic-free dead zones were spreading, so you'd be flying along and suddenly your broom would stop working. The rest of the world walled Britain in so the horror wouldn't spread. Eerie music came from nowhere. Also Hermione slept with Charlie, maybe because he was the only Weasley left. That might not be exactly what you're looking for.

** Linkao3(17541269) This one kinda fits. “before they convinced you life is war” by EclipseWing. If you haven't read anything by them you definitely should. Every single fic I've read, I've loved. The premise of this one is that people are reborn into a world where magic isn't real, but people who used to be wizards have “mutations” (think X-Men). Some remember their past lives and some don't. It's not exactly what you're looking for, but it's still ridiculously good.
