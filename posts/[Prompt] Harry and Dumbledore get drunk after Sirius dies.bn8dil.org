** A 115 year old getting drunk with a 15 y.o is very creepy. I've personally always loved that scene, because it shows Harry truly letting his frustrations out for the first time in his life. He's suffered abuse for 13+ years at this point, and its great that he finally gets to release his emotions. Dumbledore isn't bothered because he's been in that situation before, and knows he can easily repair the damage Harry is doing.

I hope Harry and the rest of the school got therapy after the war b/c they would of been seriously messed up.

*** Huh, I really didn't think of the implications. I was thinking more of drinking and reminiscing on their losses. Plus canon Dumbledore has no qualms providing alcohol in the beginning of Half Blood Prince.

** My own â€˜fix-it' version of the DoM Battle will feature a somewhat different sequence:

- Harry got the vision from Voldemort
- Harry called Sirius via the Mirror, who insisted on using this opportunity to set a counter trap against Voldemort. Harry gave in after a long argument
- Harry and his friends set up Umbridge in the Forbidden Forest
- The Order mobilized, with them polyjuiced as Harry's friends, including Dumbledore
- They surprised and neutralized most Death Eaters present, but Sirius got cocky and was hit by Bellatrix's killing curse
- Voldemort showed up to save Bellatrix
- Harry and Dumbledore both blamed themselves later, and got drunk together in the Headmaster's office
