** The Noble and Most Ancient House of Black.

In Book 5, it's on a tapestry of an /infamously/ narcissistic family and it's a chapter title. In fanon, it's part of an entire nobility-system, complete with hierarchy and hereditary governmental power.

*** Short of governmental power, it is an interesting concept plausibly suitable for the wizarding world considering it removed itself from the muggle world during the era when peerage and nobility was prominent in society.

**** it's not really an idea, things are a bit like that in the UK. We literally have the house of Lords and most of our modern PMs were either aristocracy or related to. I said it in the other responses, but good family names are a huge thing in the UK. The surname Churchill wasn't just important because the guy was a famous PM, no. The surname was a big deal even before Winston, and still to this day will open a lot of doors for you.

You kind of see that with the American Kennedy family.

***** The thing is, a lot of the factors which lead to the rise of democracies (eg world wars, agricultural+industrial revolutions, long travel times between continents) are irrelevant in the magical world. Hell, there was no French or 1848 revolution which spread the ideas of self-determination and freedom throughout the world. At most, it was a marginal effect. We know that the Minister is elected, but there is no reason to assume a universal franchise for example.

So not only is it logical to assume that the Wizengamot is akin to the House of Lords, it should look a lot more like the one before the 1911 Act of Parliament.

*** I honestly don't think it is that jarring. I live in the UK and we still have a proper aristocracy, peerage, lordship, barony, earldom etc. Additionally, old names matter a lot in the UK, most of our politicians that have achieved something (including the current PM) are either aristocracy or have very strong family ties to them (modern times Churchill, Eden, Douglas-Home, Macmillan, Cameron, Johnson).

FFS, we still have silly things like the Marquess of Winchester.

Lord is not a title per se, it just means you have some peerage. Fics using lord as a title on its' own are kind of incorrect because they don't take into account that their actually peerage rank is more important - you don't introduce someone as the Lord of Winchester, you introduce someone as the Marquess/Earl of Winchester.

There's an elected Ministry that handles the political side of things. There's the Wizengamot, which is pretty much /just/ a court of law in the books - with the Ministry being able to insert or remove jurors or overseers. There's no hint of aristocracy playing into those.

Meanwhile, Common Fanon has members of Ancient and Noble Houses pretty much automatically having political power whether they want to or not, all places on the Wizengamot being hereditary, et cetera.

But it isn't ;) Wizengamot is the legislative part of the government, court-of-law is not the right way to describe it, because it diminishes its power. We also don't know how Wizengamot is created - similar to the house of Lords, you can be nominated to both, furthermore, we also know that seats can also be hereditary.

In the UK, we also elect the PM (or precisely the ruling party that elects their PM).

Let's not forget that while a good world builder, JKR didn't come up with thing on her own, she builds them on the British culture and system. The simplest examples just from the school alone are:

- boarding school
- three terms
- frequent half-term breaks
- you go to a more serious school when you are 11
- OWLS are literally GCSEs
- NEWTs are no different to A-Levels - length of study, flexibility, limited subjects
- school uniforms
- houses (yes, houses are a thing at many secondary schools, not all but many)

EDIT: Don't get me wrong , I actually close the fic when there's Lord Potter, Lord Black whatever. But arguing that aristocracy and surnames are not a thing in the UK is just incorrect.

****** So, it's a parliament as well as a Court - my bad. That still doesn't necessarily imply aristocracy has automatic involvement though - we don't see whether it has even a /similar/ structure to the Muggle British one with its separation between the House of Lords and the House of Commons.

We only really see it in action as the court of law - we even have to take "legislative body" from what I consider "Optional Canon" (Pottermore/Wizarding World and the Wiki).

I haven't seen a single hint of seats being hereditary - in the books /or/ on Optional Canon Sites. I'd love to know where you got that one - as far as I know, it's straight up never said how the Wizengamot is formed or even structured outside of "There's a Chief Warlock and then there's Everyone Else".

#+end_quote

It doesn't automatically mean it, but it does imply it.Consider the Statute of Secrecy, which is used to imply the major point of separation of Muggle and Magical culture: What was the primary form of the government in the UK at the time? Hereditary Peers in the House of Lords.Heck, We still had several hundred Hereditary Peers in the house of lords until that inheritance of seats system was finally completely abolished in 1999.

While I agree, it doesn't outright state that to be the case, there is a strong implication of it being the case.

I am against fictions that focus on political power more than magic myself, and don't tend to enjoy the same sort of political manoeuvring happening constantly for two reasons.\\
Firstly, Most of the points raised by the "good" side are presented as being extremely eloquent and unbeatable. Many of the points they raise I will often see strong arguments against straight away, but the author writes the opposition into silence and stunned shock as they are defeated completely by a single argument they can't refute, Which is completely unrealistic.\\
Secondly, It detracts from any good storyline that is based around the magic of the world it is set in. Most of the "political intrigue" style stories I have read seem to be egotrips for the author going "look how clever I am, to make these arguments that no-one can refute" while also tweaking the rules and giving their "team" some sorts of abilities that completely unbalance the narrative (more votes to older houses, duels passing votes to the victor, etc.) In the end, these are essentially a deus-ex-machina "I win" button that removes any of the actual interesting stuff in political intrigue stories from mattering.

******** Something I've just realized, that might add to this - one of the House Ghosts is, in fact, called the Bloody Baron. According to Pottermore, the "Baron" part of the nickname isn't just for show.

That's an indication that nobility is recognized, with the same exact titles as the Muggle part of the UK - or at least, it was in those days.\\
It'd still mean that the fanon /structure/ of it, with all its weird rules about when a family is allowed to call itself "Ancient", "Most Ancient" and/or "Noble" and how many votes they get because of it, is mostly because of the one tapestry.

The /starting point of the discussion/ was "which things from canon got completely blown up".\\
I'm being entirely factual when I say the entire fanon structure of Wizarding Nobility was based on a chapter title and a line on a tapestry that's most likely a self-given title (thus, about as indicative as if someone named himself "Lord of the Bathtub"), and that the books give little to no further indication of Magical Britain having nobility in the first place, let alone in that structure.

I'll even agree that magical nobility, as parallel to Muggle Britain's peerage, /could/ be a good addition to the worldbuilding in theory, at that (in practice it tends to go hand-in-hand with a lot of tropes I dislike). But, the structure it's most commonly given by fanon? One tapestry.

***** You know what's really stupid? (Extended) canon assumes that America united when the Statute of Secrecy was enacted, following the British model of magical governance. If you look at a map of 1700 America, most of it is Spanish and French (with very little in regards to actual governance for the most part). Prior to about 1760, there was no "American" identity and even then it was one based on the British colonies. So why would some random natives on the West coast join a magical US 60ish years before there was even the idea of an American nation (and the continent-wide idea of manifest destiny came even later)?

And magic not only makes it easy to put down a colonial revolt (you have almost instantaneous transport so you can bring your entire force to bear without leaving your lands open for a few years and losing a thrid during transport). It makes it very easy to keep colonies connected to the main country so they do not develop their own identity.

So imagine the sheer hilarity of a patriotic Muggleborn from Texas being told that he is a subject of the magical King of Spain.

**** Based on your spelling and the words you use, I think it is safe to say you are not British.

In the UK lords, aristocracy and certain surnames REALLY are a thing. Most of our politicians with power come from the aristocracy or have very close, direct ties to them. For example, Boris Johnsson is not some nobody:

- descendant of King George II on his father's side

- maternal grandfather was a European Commission for Human Rights, and was also *knighted*

- great grandfather was a Turkish Minister of the Interior

- Eton educated, despite not having good grades he also went on to Oxford

Additionally, his family has very well connected to Oxford and Oxford University. Similarly, Cameron also had a strong connection to aristocracy (has family connections to the royal family).

I moved to the Uk almost a decade ago, believe me, British politics is very much about surnames and aristocracy. Names matter a lot here. (EDIT) Therefore such a family as Black with strong connections to all other old families that produced ministers etc. would be regarded as powerful and well-respected, with a lot of influence.

But it slowly died out after the War because of the Death Eaters, and murders, and all these messed up things. It would be coherent, especially seeing how they live in the past, and a lot of things still advantage purebloods and discriminates muggleborns.

Another moment which always seems to turn up on lists of 'when Harry was betrayed' is McGonagall's advice to keep his head down in OotP. It's sensible advice! Harry challenges Umbridge in a situation where she has all the power and comes off worst. I can understand why he does it after witnessing Cedric's death but objectively it wasn't smart. I assume getting rid of Umbridge isn't as simple as calling Aurors after she makes Harry use the Blood Quill, otherwise Umbridge would be too stupid to make a satisfying antagonist.

***** I always thought that was the point (or Rowling's point), that as Head of Gryffindor, McGonagall knows her kids and is responsible for guiding them away from the easy to fall in pitfalls (such as this would be for a Gryffindor.)

I figured that was why McGonagall was so snappy- it is frustrating for her because usually she can do it over months or over the last few years (the younger kids are growing their bravery and sense of chivalry, the mid-late teens are learning how and when to apply them) and this time this stupid and infuriating but dangerous woman means she has not months but minutes to get it bloody well through bloody Potter's bloody thick skull and she /knows/ that it is almost futile to shove this lesson in so quickly without a real world experience of consequences to tie it to /but/ the consequences of her /not/ succeeding in teaching it are so much bigger than just her and Harry and house points.

Basically, usually she would be using relatively safe, school based exploits (e.g. Catching students out in the grounds with an illegal dragon, breaking up fights or duels) to mentor her Gryffindor kids so they avoid making the same mistakes in adult life when the stakes are higher than losing house points- but this time she has to teach it when the stakes have suddenly become astronomical, to a kid who she loves but realises is not brilliant at impulse control in the face of injustice.

HOWEVER one lovely thing i am learning from this subreddit is my reading of the subtext is not universal and things I found "obvious" are not necessarily there for everyone, and are not necessarily correct! So if you didn't see it that way off the bat I could be dead wrong.

Could've happened without being mentioned during later Platform runs, to boot.

This would mean she saw a small black-haired kid with an owl and trunk out of the corner of her eye /before/ speaking up, hoping that if he was a student he'd hear and follow, but if he was a random muggle, he'd have no clue what was being said and ignore her, which muggles probably do all the time when they don't know anything and only hear out of context weird words or phrases like "muggle," "Hogwarts," and "Platform 9 3/4," the latter of which is probably assumed to be a kid joking around when they don't know the reality.

As someone who follows rules naturally and also who is out of her element in the wizarding world, I think she's unlikely to /let herself/ think out of the box in case that's 1) dangerous or 2) social faux pas.

There's also multiple cautionary tales in their education of people who experimented with magic and got burnt, as well as her own polyjuice cat adventure and what happened to Luna's mother to ward her off.

** I believe the first book just has several /unfinished ideas/ about the wizarding world that should be disregarded in the bigger picture. Things Rowling had not fleshed out yet when they were introduced. I believe that there could have been several muggle train stations with maybe a number of wizarding platforms, not just the Hogwarts Express. That it could have been first meant as a widespread method of transportation for wizards over long distances.

It was a mode of wizarding travel shown first (aside from Sirius' motorcycle) - surely Rowling didn't write it as a one-thing-only concept at first. Ginny's grown up with several older brothers, watched them leave for Hogwarts, and would certainly know the /only wizarding platform in Britain./ It does only make sense if there were supposed to be more places to leave from.

There are several such unfinished things there. Pets: only owl, cat, or a toad are allegedly allowed. We see exactly one toad the whole time, and several other species (rats/ferrets, puffskeins are mentioned I think - Lee brings a tarantula, though that can be attributed to rule-breaking). Also, Ron wouldn't try an incantation that goes /sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, turn this stupid fat rat yellow./ He'd know that's not how incantations work, and he's not so thick as to ignore they should be in incomprehensible words most of the times and don't rhyme. Not even Fred and George should be able to fool him to think that is a real spell. It's what a muggleborn child could expect of magic, but not Ron.

Tl,dr: authors, please do not nitpick one out-of-place line in a pilot book and turn it into a masterminds plotting, just like you wouldn't do it because of a typing error.

You would take the underpass (or overpass, but that would be more nerve wracking!) towards platforms 10 and 11, and then instead of turning and going left or right to take the stairs or lift to ground level, you go straight ahead through the wall, and there's more tunnel.

Snape's redemption.

People took this, and went ‘he was a hero all along!' ‘He died for love!' ‘He was a tortured soul!' And then they wrote fics where he's suddenly an ideal authority figure to the Slytherins or even a father figure to Harry.

He might not have been all bad, but he joined a Nazi cult that hated people like the woman he claimed to love, struck a bargain so that she'd be spared--- but not her child, bullied children under his care, and prevented an innocent man from getting his name cleared.

So, yeah. His redemption gets way blown out of proportion.

I actually feel like that kind of gets blown out of proportion the other direction (including by Dumbledore himself--"you disgust me"). Snape knew full well that there was zero chance of convincing Voldemort to back off from Harry since he was the subject of the prophecy, so of course he didn't press his luck by asking. (That he didn't swallow his pride and ask protection for James is an issue, albeit entirely within his character.)

Redemption? Well, he saw the error of his ways and dedicated his life to righting that particular wrong, but it didn't inspire him whatsoever to stop being a petty jerk. So, kind of half and half? Which is exactly what makes him so compelling as a /complex/ character.

** Maybe Dumbledore /did/ put Molly up to it.

You see, Muggleborn children got their usual orientation packet that had the information. Harry didn't get one, because he isn't Muggleborn and/or he didn't show up for the orientation thanks to Vernon.

Now, the night before, Dumbledore realises that Harry wouldn't know how to get to Platform 9 3/4. It's too late to send an owl, all the professors are busy getting ready for the start of the year, and he doesn't want to waste anyone's time just to send them out to meet Harry.

So, he asks himself, who would be at Kings Cross that morning anyway whom he could trust?

Long story short, he floos Arthur and Molly and asks them to be on the lookout for Harry Potter and to direct him towards the right platform. To avoid scaring Harry with "stranger danger", Molly doesn't just walk up to him but rather talks about the platform and how to get to get in where Harry can overhear.

*** At this point in time, Dumbledore does not particularly know Molly and Arthur. He doesn't really get to know them until OOTP - they are not original order members. The Weasley family are a prominent wizarding family, but that doesn't mean everyone actually knows them personally - to Dumbledore they are just the parents of some of the children in his school.

Muggle borns have a teacher come and explain everything to them (Snape tells Lily that in the prince's tale) and so they presumably go through everything like how to get to Diagon Alley and how to get on the train. Harry got Hagrid ... who didn't give him all the information he needed but there's no reason Dumbledore would ever know Hagrid hadn't told him everything he was supposed.

But even if he did - sending a letter to Harry, sending a teacher to Harry, or even just asking Molly to specifically look out for him and help him (no one is worried about stranger danger over a middle aged woman accompanied by 5 children ... and I don't think wizards even have the whole stranger danger thing) would make more sense than asking Molly to make a statement loud enough for Harry to overhear as she walked past him and hope he had the sense and the nerve to go up and talk to her.

That's literally the stupidest way he could go about solving the problem.

And also he doesn't particularly know Molly and Arthur at this point - certainly not any better than he knows any other of the parents.

There are plenty of ways for them to know each other, and even if not, many reasons for Dumbledore to consider them trustworthy.

As for how Dumbledore found out, maybe it had been panicked Hagrid who rushed into Dumbledore's office, shouting that he'd forgotten to tell Harry how to get on the train. I don't remember the Prince's Tale that well, but anything Snape would tell Lily pre-Hogwarts would necessarily be very speculative on his part.

***** yes there are plenty of ways to know each other - and no suggestion that he does know them in any way particularly well. Arthur's work does not bring him into contact with Hogwarts and is a small and unimportant office. Having had her brothers in the order and not her actually suggests he doesn't know Molly very well rather than the opposite. If he knew her and was close to her because of her brothers why were her and Arthur not in the order? as you say, they are blood traitor, muggle loving Gryffindors - they're older than James and Lily so it's not age. James and Lily and Frank and Alice have children,so it's not that they're parents ... they're just not in it. At the point of Philosopher's Stone - her brothers have been dead 10 years, even if he spoke to her at the time - that's a long time ago.

The truth is most wizards work for the ministry, most wizard's children go to Hogwarts ... he has as much reason to know them as he knows anyone else and no evidence is provided that his relationship with them is any closer than it is with anyone else. Certainly a woman who has to get four boys onto the train with all their luggage all by herself, when two of them are known trouble makers, is not a good choice of people to suddenly ask an added extra of. He must know ministry wizards with rather less children at Hogwarts whose hands would be rather less full.

The night before is not too late to send an owl. Harry has been receiving owls to very specific addresses when he wakes up for over a week. He only changed rooms the night before he got the one addressed to 'the smallest bedroom', they only spent one night in the 'railview hotel' ... and how do you think Daily Prophet owls deliver the paper if not between printing at night and the next morning?

It is NEVER too late for someone who can apparate to pop round to someone's house to speak to them ... no teacher is so busy, when they're classes don't start for a whole other day and the children won't arrive until after dark, to appear instantaneously in Privet Drive - give a message and then reappear instantly outside Hogwarts gates. After all Halloween happens midterm - and yet Professor McGonagall had time to go to Privet Drive and spend all day sitting on the wall - she can go back for two minutes before term starts.

But even with all that ... and even if Molly was the best person to choose (and there is still no evidence he knows her any better than any other witch or wizard and he must know less busy witches to ask) it still makes more sense for her to stand by the barrier and wait for him (he will turn up somewhere between platforms 9 and 10 at some point) than it does to have her hurry past at the last minute talking about muggles and then pointedly asking what number the platform is (if he hadn't happened to overhear - she can't control what he's paying attention to...).

And then having walked past at the precise right moment and yes he was listening and yes he did notice ... they then have to hope that a little boy all by himself is brave enough to go up and start a conversation with a strange woman with a large group of children - some of whom are older and therefore may seem intimidating. (Tellingly, this was precisely not his first choice to do - he first just tried to watch what they were doing and copy them, it was only when he couldn't work it out that he realised 'there was nothing else for it...' and he goes to speak to her. Talking to her is very much a last resort of desperation.)

Or you know ... that isn't what happened, because even Dumbledore's plans - even VOLDEMORT'S plans are not that ridiculous and convoluted. And an owl could have reached him at some point before 11 in the morning - even if he had already left home, the owl would find him.

I mean - if Dumbledore had time to floo Molly and Arthur, he had time to got to Privet Drive.

When he leaves Ron something in his will and Scrimgeour asks why, Ron shrugs and Hermione says 'he was very fond of you, Ron,' and Harry thinks about how that's a stretch because as far as he's aware, Dumbledore never spoke to Ron one on one in six years. He doesn't teach, he isn't a head of house, he doesn't deal with most of the punishments, he doesn't even go to all the quidditch matches because him being at the one Snape referees is considered a surprising thing ...

And if that's the contact he's having with the kids ... how much less is he having with the parents? Even if we stretch the point that he had a close relationship with Percy and Bill because they were head boys (though we see through Ron and Hermione he has nothing to do with prefects beyond selecting them) that's not Molly and Arthur he's having the relationship with. He wouldn't know them any better than he knew any other head boy's parents. He might send owls home about Fred and George (McGonagall might do that though) but that's a one sided thing - he sends a letter, Molly reads the letter - she doesn't write back. It'snot a fond correspondence, it's a 'your child is behaving badly' telling off.

Even if Hogwarts was the type of school where parents turned up every day to collect their kids, the teachers wouldn't 'know' them in any meaningful sense and the headmaster wouldn't know them at all. But it's a boarding school and the Weasley children don't just spend all term there - they spend Christmas and Easter holidays there too ...

In the film, the Twins say it - and Molly is mad enough at them that she'd probably think they were making it up.

Thing is, in England it's not actually that common to see barred windows, especially in villages - shuttered sometimes, in older homes. Barred, /very occasionally/ in extremely seedy neighborhoods where break-in prevention is the order of the day. Basically never in small villages like what Little Whinging is supposed to be.

So while it would be unusual in a nighbourhood like Privet Drive in the 1990s to have a window with bars on and was put in for comedic/dramatic effect, the same neighbourhood in the 1950s or 60s might well have had windows with bars on.

*** Although it is uncommon to have bars on your window in Britain (and she would know that - if purely because having never seen bars on a window it would never cross her mind that people /might/ put bars on a window) and the twins tell her they're starving him - I always interpret this scene as her really being too busy and too angry to actually /listen/ to what they're saying. She can hear them and she's responding - but she's not taking it in.

Though I'm never surprised she doesn't ever do anything about the way the Dursley's treat Harry either. It literally isn't her place too - she has no right to go round to the house of people she has never met and kick up a fuss about how they run their home. Parents in Britain take a very dim view on other people interfering with their children or telling them how to parent.

Harry's muggle primary school should have called social services years ago, certainly these days the amount of school he missed would have triggered all sorts of home visits and interventions ... but Molly has no jurisdiction and going round and yelling at the Dursley's wouldn't solve anything and technically she would be in the wrong. You can't just turn up at people's houses and start kicking off.

And though she repeatedly asks Dumbledore if Harry can come straight to hers over the summer (the only thing she can do is give him somewhere else safe to go) obviously that is never allowed because of the protection charm.

Not to mention the Dursleys appear to tell everyone he's a hooligan and the teachers seem to believe it (the hair incident) so i can see them believing Harry is skiving or that they're dealing with his 'issues'.

Even if Social services were called there's no guarantee that anything would happen, with the numerous failings that have resulted in deaths, he's not being abused 'enough' for any action to be taken I'd think.

And whereas schools are on top of attendance now like you wouldn't believe (ofsted - if attendance isn;t good the school will fail) I don't remember them particularly caring about attendance 30 years ago.

But my point is - there were people who could have gone in to deal with Harry,who had the legal right to, who's job it was, who did let him down ... Molly isn't one of them. She has no right to interfere and she knows that - all she can do is provide a safe place for Harry to go to.

What really puts me off about Molly's actions in that regard is that she told Harry that she and Arthur would have gotten him away from there the next weekend. Thereby, they acknowledge that Harry had to be removed from there. And then they do nothing. Especially in the case of abused children, that kind of false hope is devastating for the child.

This is before the Order and increased security, there is no reason to keep Harry under so much protection when the available normal protections should be sufficient. Likewise, they do nothing when Harry begs for food at the start of GoF. Or rather, the response is pretty much "let him eat cake instead". And a child begging for food should set off some alarm bells.

This was not him abandoning his friends, this was him stepping outside to clear his head for a minute after being psychologically tortured by a piece of Voldemort's soul and then being mugged and injured before he could get back.

The other would be Snape's Worst Memory making James a permanent bully and monster in the eyes of the fandom. Firstly, he is described as growing out of it (if the fandom can cut Draco and Snape slack they can do the same for James). Secondly, the incident is removed from context. It could very well be the equivalent of Draco using the Sectumsempra incident to try and characterize his entire rivalry with Harry. It is worth noting that Harry randomly hexes people in the corridors in sixth year (Filch and Goyle as I recall) as well and the narrative and fandom don't really condemn him for it.

If you were going to worry about hypothermia, the higher you go the colder it gets.

My personal head cannon is that Sirius would have at least prepared Harry for the journey (cleaned him up, cast a warming charm on the blanket, told Hagrid the best way to carry him while on the bike and even enlarged the bike to support Hagrids size) before Hagrid took him away, on Dumbledores orders.

I imagine Hagrid probably wasn't even allowed to tell Sirius (or anyone) that he was to take Harry to live with muggles.

Harry got a suspicious broom and didn't immediately try to trace it. Although in his defense, Dumbledore sent him an invisible cloak without a signature, so there's precedence for mysterious gifts.

Hermione was stupid because she didn't voice her concerns before telling McGonagall. Seriously, if it was cursed, she left plenty of time for them to die.

But then again, /I/ would never have been friends with Hermione in the first place, precisely because those traits of hers are a dealbreaker for me.

** Easily James and Sirius states as bullies. Ignore Peter the arselick and Remus who does nothing but just watch. James Potter is not a saint in the words of Severus bloody Snape.

​

If there was a man less qualified to give a opinion on James Potter it would be him. In no way am I defending James but it's like in canon when Harry, Fred and George literally but the shit out of Draco that was such a satisfying scene in the book albeit violent. Also these were kids whose petty school rivalry in their early years actually mattered when people started to pick sides and Severus decided to betray his best friend.

Like I believe Snape is an incredible written character but he is not and never was a good man he was twisted by his affection and selfish in his desires. If it was Neville he would've been contempt to let them die and he bullies Neville so badly his worst fear of all. Scarier than Voldemort, scarier than Bellatrix who ruined his life but his Potions teacher like that is one of the saddest parts of Neville's story for me.

In context James and Sirius really weren't that awful that Snape's biggest fear was them in fact if we are being matter of fact Snape is the reason Lily is dead. By proxy he killed her yet no once ever mentions it or talks about it.

** Because it's weird.

I agree that both the author's intent and the actual story reasoning is benign and not a big deal. But if you want to make a conspiracy story out of Harry Potter, this is just one of the many coincidences that draw red flags.

The Weasleys are an old Pureblood family, and despite how pro-Muggleborns they are, their lifestyle is pretty much exclusively centered in the Wizarding world. No Muggle relatives, no Muggle friends, not even much experience in the Muggle world.

From the get go, the fact that they take the Muggle route towards the platform is strange. It may have been understood if Arthur took them that way, but he was absent. And I just don't see why Molly would bother with this, instead of taking the Floo.

And shouting about the platform, and Muggles? Again, while both the author and (most of) us wouldn't really consider it a big deal, someone looking for the conspiracy would. Because, again, it's just a strange thing to do. There are over three centuries of deep indoctrination about the importance of the SoS and how it must never be challenged/threatened by anyone, and a Pureblood just straight up screams Wizarding terms out in the open like that?

​

It's a tinfoil hat way of looking at the story, but it's just one of the many pieces you can use to put together a set-up conspiracy.

She still asked, just because it gave me something to /do/ when otherwise I was entirely useless to the grocery-shopping.

Asking the platform number is the same way. Ginny is there because her parents don't want to leave her home alone, but she'd have felt even worse about being there if she didn't at least feel like she was contributing something.

Most Muggleborn kids /are/ in fact visited by a professor. Harry wasn't, at least not until Hagrid, because it was assumed by the staff that the Dursleys would have /told him/ about the magical world.

Hagrid is still Hogwarts staff, plus he has business in Diagon Alley anyway. Might as well pick up Harry while he's at it. The fact that he forgets to mention "oh, this is how you get onto the platform" isn't that big a deal - Hagrid's not the brightest bulb.

** People seem to be forgetting about the Statute of Secrecy. Shouting about Platform 9 3/4 in the middle of the largest muggle train station in London is definitely not a good look vis a vis the Statute. At best, Molly is tired, negligent, naive, ignorant, stupid, etc. for doing so, and at worst it's part of a manipulation, being shouted so Harry hears it and will come ask for help. It's not that much of a stretch - it's about as plausible as her just being dumb enough to flaunt the Statue in the center of muggle London.

On topic, if I had to pick one that actually bothered me, it would be Snape's memory being used to demonize James as an irredeemable bully and Harry hates him and renounces the name of Potter in favor of Peverell or Evans etc.

In reality... most of these never bothered me. The reality is that Rowling is just absolute shit at world building and was probably flying by the seat of her pants for most if not all of her tenure writing the series. There are simply too many gaps, too many holes, too many inconsistencies and red flags, and too many questions raised by readers as a result of all these things that she doesn't answer. The closest things to answers are these little moments people are complaining about being extrapolated.

Why would a Pureblood wizard speak loudly about muggles and Platform 9 3/4 in King's Cross station - blatantly flaunting the Statue of Secrecy - just to try and educate her kids or something equally way less important than maintaining the Statue of Secrecy?

When the UK has a House of Lords and peerages, with family names being exceedingly important, and the Dark Pureblood families exert tremendous influence on the ministry - which is steeped in corruption - throughout the story, and said families openly demonstrate bigotry against muggles and muggleborns throughout the series, why in the world would anyone think wizarding Britain is somehow more progressive than muggle Britain where Wizengamot membership is democratic instead of hereditary?

If Gringotss and the goblins keep the vaults of every wizard in Britain, how are investments, contracts, etc handle? Why wouldn't the goblin bankers logically offer these services? Likewise, if the goblins employ and train some of the best curse breakers in the series and it's repeatedly hammered upon how stupid it would be to try and steal from Gringotts, why wouldn't they likewise be some of the best at warding and defense, and offer these things as services as well?

Why would Dumbledore do the bare minimum in observing Harry? Arabella Figg at the very least had to have observed Harry was very small for his age, wearing cast-off clothing three or four times too big for him. Both of these are obvious signs of ill treatment, so the logical thing would have been for her to inform Dumbledore and for him to follow up on it. Greater Good!Dumbledore and Manipulative!Dumbledore became a thing primarily because this is only one of the many, many things that make you question whether it makes more sense for Dumbledore to be playing chess with Harry's life than it does for Dumbeldore to be THAT incompetent and negligent.

These are just off the top of my head. With a competent world builder at the helm like Robert Jordan, George R. R. Martin, Robin Hobb, Steven Eriksen, Tad Williams, Brandon Sanderson, list goes on... you wouldn't need to ask these questions because these things would have just been explained as a natural part of building the world.

I've seen fan fiction authors like LeadVonE be FAR more competent at world building than Rowling.

Potter is not a wizarding family name and also not in Sacred-28, so it implies new origin of family. Potters don't have seat in wizengamot as they were given only to the sacred 28 whom are the early wizarding family settlers in the magical Britain.

Compared to House of Prewett and Weasleys house of Potter is pathetic. These fanfiction writers project Naive and closed minded Hermione Granger as Rowena Ravenclaw 2.0 and Boy-with-infinite-luck Harry Potter as Godric Gryffindor 2.0/ Salazar Slytherin 2.0.

*** Though the fanon interpretation of Harry's family history is often overblown, information has been provided on the Potter family since the publishing of the books:

The Potters weren't on the Sacred 28 list, but the first Potter dates back to the 12th century. Linfred of Stinchcombe was known as the “Potterer,” which then turned into the “Potter“ surname. I think it's fair to call them an old wizarding family and not of new origin. And Henry Potter, Harry's great-grandfather, did serve on the Wizengamot.

If the house in Godric's Hollow was a family house, then it was likely through the Peverell line. Hardwin Potter, Linfred's son, married Iolanthe Peverell, who lived in Godric's Hollow.

Your view of the Sacred 28 is also a pretty overblown fanon interpretation:

The Sacred 28 was a list created in the 1930s by a blood purist, listing the families who were still believed to be purebloods at the time. There's no indication that these families were the only early wizarding settlers of Great Britain, or that being part of this list means you have a seat in the Wizengamot. If that were true then Lucius Malfoy would be a member and he clearly wasn't, since he wasn't present as part of the Wizengamot during Harry's trial in 5th year.

**** It was a (failed) attempt at slapstick humor consistent with the cartoonish vibe of the early books in my opinion. It doesn't excuse the behavior but I do actually think that CoS was still oriented too much towards children to actually intend to cover topics such as child abuse.

The first book carries off the Dahlesque overexaggerated nature of the Dursleys' behavior to Harry far better than the second.

*** How would Petunia know about Harry surviving all those things, she still tries to hit him with an object that could cause serious damage it doesn't matter what Harry already survived, More and often I see more people trying to downplay the abuse Harry suffered in canon.

**** Hard agree. That incident is often held up as an example of the physical abuse Harry suffered, and for good reason. There are so many complaints that fics overplay the abuse, and a lot of fics do (the Dursleys wouldn't have beaten him half to death), but they clearly were physically rough with him in canon. Vernon tried to choke Harry at the beginning of book 5 and only stopped because Harry's magic kicked in, and there is every reason to believe that they smacked him around as a matter of course, even if they weren't outright beating him.

*** Petunia did not know that Harry could survive getting hit in the head with a frying pan when she swung at him. Not knowing he could survive that means she was willing/trying to do lasting harm to him if not kill him. Even if Harry's magic caused the pan to bounce off or turn into bubbles it would not change the fact that Petunia swung at him with a frying pan.

If you stab someone in the chest and you were unaware that they were wearing a stab vest that's an attempted murder.

** If you've seen or read the play History Boys by Alan Bennett he it would do wonders to political debates and how they function.\\
Even when you know it's wrong but it will benefit you use the information and twist it to fit your narrative.\\
That's how media and politics work finding what fits your narrative and making sure to undermine or overreact to whatever the magical problem is.\\
Literally what they did in book 5 remember and they used that as the crux of the Potter is a Plotter and Dumbles is crazy.\\
Let's be honest though the idea of court is interesting but it's execution has always been boring and unsatisfactory.\\
Most court stuff is a byproduct and terrible !SlytherinHarry fics or something that involves woke Harry stands against the opression and gets past fully grown men with an argument that goes like "no u".\\
Completely forgetting that nerves area thing of course somehow anxiety fails to exist. Like what 16 year old van actually not fumble when In a high pressure speaking situation like many get in that situation.

** She obviously saw Harry lost and with an owl and wanted to help him. What I hate about those stories is that 99.99999% of the time it's the author hating on the naivety of canon Harry so they decide to create an alternative dimension that's basically opposite day-Voldemort's misunderstood , Dumbledore's an evil mastermind, Harry's the most cunning Slytherin, and the Weasleys are whining/preaching/annoyingly pureblooding canon Harry as if they have a seer. Ginny: But Dumbledore told me Harry Potter is going to fall in love with me and we'll get married and have children and name our second son after him! Ron: But Potter's supposed to become my best mate and the ugly Granger know-it-all mudblood is supposed to do my schoolwork! Molly: And I'm supposed to be his surrogate mother figure! Like... what?! Did Dumbledore travel here from the canon universe and decide to become an evil mastermind an manipulate reality to his will? IT'S SO ANNOYING AND A WEAK EXCUSE TO BASH EVERYTHING REMOTELY CANON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Especially when Harry keeps getting obliviated when he finds out the truth, or imprisoned when he defeats Voldemort to early or does the right thing. I have absolutely nothing against Dumbledore basing fics, and will even love them when done right, but cringeworthy extremism gives me enough 2nd-hand awkwardness/embarrassment to last a lifetime. Like... Dumbledore is a manipulative bastard vs. Dumbledore mapped out all of Harry's life and all of canon starting with a fake prophecy. Select Weasleys with malicious intentions vs. lazy, whining, there-isn't-even-a-word-to-describe-how-much-we-hate-you, Weasleys who ride through life on Dumbledore's perceived idea of canon. Voldemort is kind of good, but select death eaters are still bad vs. Voldemort is the saviour of the world and Dumbledore hates him for no reason other than he opposes him and has a large support base.
