I don't care if it's Hermione/Seven of Nine from Star Trek Voyager, Hermione/Jane Shepard from Mass Effect, Hermione/Padme Amidala from Star Wars or Hermione/Meera Reed from Game of Thrones.


** The crossover protagonist was reincarnated in female Harry's body in linkao3(like a bat out of hell).

  When Naruto died at the hands of a civilian during his academy days, so did the Kyuubi no Kitsune. Now here the Kyuubi was, reincarnated, and bouncing around in an eleven year old girl's body, while half the wizarding world treated her like the second coming of Merlin (whoever that was)... and the rest didn't know what to make of her...[HP/Naruto fic utilising dubious canon elements. You have been warned!]
