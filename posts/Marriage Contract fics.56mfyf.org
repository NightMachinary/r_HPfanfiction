Probably on the level of Contractual Invalidation by RDude. Any that exists?


** Was going to suggest Contractual Invalidation. Don't think there are any others.\\
Speaking of which, that last chapter of CI was good. So hyped for next one.

  A book left by Sirius opens Harry's eyes as he delves into the mysteries of magic, learns about the realities of a war, and shifts towards the Grey. Meanwhile, Daphne Greengrass is faced with an unusual solution that involves the Boy-Who-Lived, but could be more trouble than it's worth. And in the end, there is always a price to be paid for everything. HP/DG Contract, 6-7th year

  One Shot. AU. A marriage contract. They want him to sign away his freedom and his future and his life on a girl who didn't even attend her best friend's funeral. Harry has other ideas.
