*In Ron's place


** "You recon she'll be back?"

"Yeah, just let her cool down."

It was eight hours before they heard a crack of apparition, and Hermione stomped into the tent and sat down with a huff.

"You know, at first, I despaired when my own spell prevented me from apparating back. Then, I realised that neither of you know how to cast it, so I just had to wait until it ran out. On the one hand, it's good that I could get back. On the other hand, you both are learning it in case something happens to me."

*Edit:* As [[/u/RoyTellier]] points out, Harry did know how to cast the protections by that point.

****** It happened in the books as well, as it turned out. From Chapter 16:

#+begin_quote
  Harry strode off through the heather, walking in a large circle with the distraught Hermione at its centre, casting the spells she usually performed to ensure their protection.
#+end_quote

So, it looks like he did know the spells by then.

This is all I have. This has never been done quite right, though. FYI, she errs on the side of light bashing of Ron and, especially, Hermione and kinda perfect Harry & Ginny.

** Both of these have Hermione leaving with Ron, rather than in Ron's place.

linkffn(Harry Potter & Death's Ultimatum by White Angel of Auralon) was inspired by sbmcneil's story, mentioned earlier. I thought this one was pretty good.

linkffn(Phase Shift by Bloodhawk 248) is a crossover with Fate/Stay Night. I wasn't impressed with this one, but I'm unfamiliar with Fate/Stay Night.
