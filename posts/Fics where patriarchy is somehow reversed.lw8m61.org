I came across a book in which the author describes a patriarchal society and gave a glimpse about what a matriarchal society would be.

And, I don't know, I kind of got curious about how it would look like in the Harry Potter universe. How it begins, what it would mean for the different characters, etc...

Does anyone know any FanFiction about that or wants to comment how they think a matriarchal magical society could look like?

** I know of one. But you might not like it. I'm the author, and I'm fairly proud of it, but it's not light reading. Linkffn(Firebird's Son).

*** Oh, Darthmarrs, your Firebird Trilogy is one of the most dystopian HP fanfics ever. Some people don't like how you made Lily to just be a spiteful bitch and not a revolutionary at heart (among other things)... but I loved it. It's an awesome series. Probably one of the staples of the fandom. I fully recommend it to everyone. Read it. It will change how you perceive certain concepts in Harry Potter.

P.S. I still think that the idea that muggles can't see spells (as in the rays of multi-coloured light) to be great. One of the best ideas I've seen.

*** I love this story so much. I reread it (along with The Bonds of Blood) at least once or twice a year. It makes me cry every time I do so (multiple times, even), but yeah, it's definitely /not/ for the light-hearted. Still an amazing work, though.

***** Sorry for saying this, but you totally deserve this. Were your fics the epitome of literary excellence, no! Were they extremely enjoyable and super fun to read? Fuck, yes! You have a very good imaginative mind and a competence in writing that very few fanfic authors have. Accept the praise for what it is, you are beyond awesome!
