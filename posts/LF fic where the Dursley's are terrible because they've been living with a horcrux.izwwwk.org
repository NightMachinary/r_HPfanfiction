Anyone remember something like this? Basically the family attempts to keep Harry apart because they sense the horcrux and it makes them miserable.

** Harry Potter and the Dance of Death has this as part of its premise. Harry's Horcrux affects people around Harry like other horcruxes do. The author uses it to explain both why the Dursleys are such caricatures of bad families and why the people in Hogwarts behave as they do, though the author exacerbates it due to, y'know, horcrux.

  Harry is destined to stop Voldemort and his followers from corrupting and overrunning the wizarding world. Unfortunately, the Horcrux in his head is working against him. His friends and family are heavily impacted by its influence. Harry is on a long path of power and mastery. Powerful!Harry, Lily finds a way to live on, Casting Shadows Prequel.

** The main one that I can think of is Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin, which isn't explicitly referring to the horcrux but let's be real, what the fuck else would it have been.
