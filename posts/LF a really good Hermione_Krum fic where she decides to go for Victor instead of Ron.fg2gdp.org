Not looking for a complete AU, but for a well written fic where Hermione falls for Krum during Yule Ball and ends up being with him and not Ron. Does it exist?


** The correct flair for this is "Request".

I had a quick go at using the filters on FFN for this, but it didn't seem to work; lots of the hits had nothing to do with the pairing.

** I really liked what the author created in this one

Edit: I'm re reading looks can be deceiving and it actually starts off in 3rd year . If you want you can skip ahead to 4th year at chapter 11 or 12. I think that's when things really get Interesting cause of viktor.
