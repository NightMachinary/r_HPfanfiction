** Linkffn(2784785)

Rorschach's Blot's time travel fic has a subplot about Hedwig and Trevor fighting crime. It's crack obviously but it's the one thing that came to mind when reading your prompt.

**** That's another Rorschach story if I remember correctly, this one has Hedwig with vaporizing laser emitting goggles, Trevor the Toad that knows Kung Fu and Foamy the Evil Rat. There are a few scenes of them tormenting Pettigrew but Agent Owl wasn't in it.
