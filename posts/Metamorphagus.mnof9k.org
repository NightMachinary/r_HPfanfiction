Any fics where the MC is a metamorph? Either of or other wise, any pairing (except Draco and harry) and the longer the better!


** Harry is one in The Prince of Slytherin, though doesn't learn that fact until part 3 and he's far from mastering the ability. There are also two other (currently known) metamorphmagi, one of whom is also a quite major character.

Some notes about the fic:\\
* A lot of people (myself included) don't like the prologue.\\
* James and Jim to start out rather shitty, but they do improve.\\
* This fic is /long./ Over a million words already, and we're only at the Quidditch World Tournament in year 4. I like the length, but I know some people think it's too long.\\
* The Death Eaters are extremely competent. I personally really like the threat they pose, but I know some people think they're too powerful.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

*** Personally, my problem isn't with the power of the Death Eaters. The Death Eaters we've seen in the story are the absolute best of the best. My problem is with how nobody else is competent. At all. At one point the entire civil service, government, and the military/police force lose a fight to a pile of rats and two unarmed prisoners. That's not OP Death Eaters, that's completely incapable everyone else. For a "reconstruction" of WBWL, it's doing a lot more justification than anything else.

  Harry decided that the only way he can win this war with his sanity intact is to train his own way without interference. But then he discovers an ability that he needs help with and only one person can provide that-Tonks. They bring the fight to the DEs in their own way so that the war will finally end.
