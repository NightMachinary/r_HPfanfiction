*** I think its because of something Rowling said about not being able to feel love if you were conceived via love potion. But I've also heard thats not what she actually said im actually not sure which it is. But I not a big fan of that concept so generally just ignore it in fanon üòÖ

**** Ravleen: How much does the fact that voldemort was conceived under a love potion have to do with his nonability to understand love is it more symbolic

J.K. Rowling: It was a symbolic way of showing that he came from a loveless union -- but of course, everything would have changed if Merope had survived and raised him herself and loved him.

J.K. Rowling: The enchantment under which Tom Riddle fathered Voldemort is important because it shows coercion, and there can't be many more prejudicial ways to enter the world than as the result of such a union.

so basically he was born because of a love potion and then raised in a loveless enviroment.

I imagine he had been exposed to love at an earlier age he would have been different

It has been an unending source of frustration that Dumbledore didn't see a troubled child raised in a shit environment and instead saw Son of Satan in 11 year old Tom Riddle. What a terrible message to send to readers: once you're bad, you're always going to be bad, there's no hope for you.

I'm a sucker for time travel fics where Tom gets raised by people who give him a chance to /not/ keep going down that destructive path; I love exploring the idea of what a little positive reinforcement from early on would've done instead of the same suspicion and distaste he'd been viewed with his whole life.

****** This particularly interesting since we hold up Harry as a complete opposite because his parents loved him. But he didn't get much love from 18 months until almost 12 (when he met the Weasleys or maybe later). I always imagine he had major work to do to become a well-adjusted adult himself. Some day I'll write the fic.

******* Ya I think the implication is Riddle also didn't really find friends in school not any real friends any way. Which if Slytherin had a culture of pro blood purity back then makes sense. He was as far as he knew half blood . He was pretty sure his mom was a muggle and he had no recognizable last name. Its kinda weird to me that he ended up a blood purist. Why support a belief system that is designed to be bad to people like you? Why would you instead not be bitter about being treated as worse than the pure bloods who you aren't recognized as to begin with?

Woulda made much more sense if he was pure blood tbh and was recognized as such.

******** Why he supported purebloods is that it probably was more profitable, its far easier to be a dictator if your pepole have been indoctrinated from birth, something you dont get with muggleborns

He also despised his muggle relatives and killed them the first opprotunity he had.

This sort of thing is why I find the Evil Dumbledore trope as it is usually written so unappealing. What need have you of thefts from vaults and plots to be the next merlin when there's perfectly-portrayed Banal Evil like this right there on the page where JKR wrote it?

******* See often Evil Dumbledore is like a bashing thing. And that's why I don't like it. I don't hate Dumbledore either but I do see alot of potential in antagonist Dumbledore or villain Dumbledore if you continue to keep him in character and its not bashing. Haven't really read anything like that but I do like the concept. Because he is in a position to be a really interesting antagonist.

People have literally always been the same drama-filled, anxiety-prone, foolish-in-love, compassionate human beings since before written history. A dickhead has always been a dickhead. Dumbledore was a total judgmental dick to a child.

** "You stand at the death stone of a man. A man that was violated in the worst way imaginable. A man that was forced to love, love his tormentor. A man, who fathered me, unwillingly, unhappily."

Harry watched Voldemort closely, his anger dimming away into a smidgeon of curiousity.

"I was given life by a witch so desperate for a man, she stooped to the lowest of depths known to the Wizarding World. A love potion. Salazar Slytherin would have rather cut his own neck than see his seed rot so much."

Voldemort kept pacing back and forth. Pettigrew flailed around in the graveyard, his throat hoarse from screaming, blood flowing from the untreated stump of what remained of his left arm.

Harry was stuck in the stone statue, his wand safely in the robes of his enemy.

"And so, Harry Potter, I refused." Voldemort looked Harry in the eyes, and his head started pounding in pain. "I refused to accept this cruel world. A world that would allow me to exist. And so, I changed." He breathed in. His slit tongue tasted the air, slithered around on his face and finally retreated into his mouth.

He summoned his wand from his robes and gave it a whirl. "Arvada Kedavra!"

Pettigrew stopped twitching.

He laughed. "Oh, my control remains. Thank Salazar!"

He then turned and again faced his foe. "Harry Potter. Thrice I have offered you peace. And thrice you have spat on its face. I don't take rejections lightly. But I am willing to give you this one chance."

He walked upto the statue holding Harry, brought his wand close to Harry's neck, and whispered, "There is more than one way to break a man's heart, you understand that, don't you? Are you willing to let your friends be killed? Oh, I can only imagine how toturous of an end it must be, days or months under the Cruciatus Curse. Can you see your friends suffer that?"

Harry's anger came back with a vengeance. "You maniac!"

"Oh I can already see it. Doesn't dear Lucius have a son in Hogwarts? How easy it would be, a little Imperius Curse here, a little Amortentia there. You friends would walk to their death on their own free will."

He laughed again, turned and started walking away.

"Your own father suffered due to this, this love potion," Harry screamed, "How can you use them?"

"For all their faults, Muggles give some ingenious words of wisdom. 'A soldier stabs just as well with the enemy's sword.' they say. And I, Harry, am a soldier." He dissaparated away.

**** I have always been a fan of Tom not particularly caring about pureblood ideology, but instead deciding to use the purebloods as an easy way to gain power and a backing.

For a Tom that grew to despise purebloods this would make sense in that he could use the purebloods to destroy their own society, and even if he did not particularly care about purebloods and their traditions, it is still an easy way for power.

This would still make sense for a Tom that wanted to get rid of Love Potions. For this plan to realistically work it would be best to completely burn the culture and society to ground and rebuild it from there. A culture like the Wizarding one is long lived with the traditions deeply ingrained into the society. Because of that, that choice to change things peacefully from the 'good-side' would be seen as the risky and non-effective choice from a person like Tom.
