** This is actually a scary concept. Imagine a non-verbal “Accio Bellatrix Lestrange's blood”

Everyone would be trying to figure out how to do this deadly new dark curse that causes your opponent's blood to come flying out of them

*** I can't find the names now, but there are two stories I've read that do this. The one that's not played for laughs has Harry do an "Accio Bellatrix Lestrange's heart" during a fight. It doesn't come out of her chest, as I recall, but the lurch against her breastbone causes it to stop.

The other story is more humorous, and I think it involves Harry getting tipsy with George and Fred in Grimmauld Place. During the process, they try to see how powerful Harry's spellcasting is, so they start playing around with things like, "accio Snape's dark mark," and end up accio'ing Voldemort in several pieces.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.

** A Black Comedy linkffn(3401052)

Harry masters the banishing and summoning charm to the extent they work in tandem as additional, invisible limbs. Perfect for snapping Dark Lord's necks. Think the Diclonius from Elfen Lied.
