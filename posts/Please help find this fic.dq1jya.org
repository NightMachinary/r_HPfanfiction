:END:
It started in the first year, and has a different Hogwarts system. I think Harry was a Hufflepuff, surely not a Gryffindor.

Basically, the house points are personal and can be used as currency (for example, having your own room or having the house elves do your laundry). The students would compete with their housemates in order to get the most points. So, they would create groups of 4 students (one of each house) in order to earn themselves the most points in the lessons (some lessons included all sorts of challenges).

Harry became friends with Neville on the train. Eventually, he broke up their group and joined Hermione.

Virtual brownies if you can help!


** That sounds a lot like Wit of the Raven

  Highly AU. Mr. Harry Potter is age eleven, and the possibilities for his future are endless. The magic system of Harry Potter has essentially been turned on its head.

There is currently another bot called [[/u/kzreminderbot][u/kzreminderbot]] that is duplicating the functionality of this bot. Since it replies to the same RemindMe! trigger phrase, you may receive a second message from it with the same reminder. If this is annoying to you, please click [[https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=kzreminderbot&subject=Feedback%21%20KZ%20Reminder%20Bot][this link]] to send feedback to that bot author and ask him to use a different trigger.
