I stumbled upon this story the other day, looking for a good "Harry gets a magical tru nk story" and found this gem. It is set 6th year and done in a way that doesn't have all those fanfiction cliche's (ie. no emancipation, no powerful Harry, no manipulative Dumbledore or bashing of anyone.) Just some light wandless magic / animagus shinaginnagians and a somewhat cannon Harry and of course Umbitch returns. Let me know what ya'll think. Hoping someone else enjoyed it as much as I did! :)

**** That, or /Seventh Horcrux/ and/or /HPMOR/. (It's a running joke in the former that Harry likes to study in his space-extended trunk, and /everyone/ who hears about it tries to warn him to be careful because their uncle/aunt/whomever tried to sleep in one, the spell failed, and "they had to bury him/her in the trunk"; it's also referenced in the latter.)

****** HPMOR did have a nod to it, though it indeed originated in /Seventh Horcrux/ and I was conflating the two.

**** LF Harry Potter/Narnia crossover where the magically expanded trunk Harry gets turns out to be a portal to Narnia.

****** Uh, yes? /The Chronicles of Narnia/ was written in English by British author C. S. Lewis. The character's name derives from the Turkish word for ‚Äúlion‚Äù.

******** That is hilarious. The translator really dropped the ball on that one. They should have called that aslan "Lion", at least.
