Im trying to find a story I read a long time ago but the only thing I remember about it is that when Harry's name came out of the goblet of fire he just calmly requested flowers for his funeral. Does anyone know the fic im looking for?

** Do you remember the length, did it start at the goblet ceremony or before, was it part of a series, do you remember the site? The flowers is pretty unique, but man, there's a lot of GOF fics out there

*** I don't remember the length but i think it's at minimum 100,00+ words, I think it's a whole 7 years type fic, I'm not sure it's part of a series, it's either fanfiction.net or ao3 those are the only sites I read fics on. I remember that he requested flowers twice once in the great hall after his name was spat out by the goblet, the other when he was with the other champions. He was super calm during this scene and got emancipated because he pointed out that the tournament was for of age competitors and since he wasn't of age he violated the contract whether he competes or not.
