** I have some nitpicks with it but linkffn(A Long Journey Home) is top-tier. You've probably already read this one though.

linkffn(Revenge of the Wizard) is a decent crossover with Star Wars

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

**** Its been a while since I read it so I could be missing some details, but imo Jasmine is nowhere near as powerful as she should be after living literally thousands of years. In the climax of the Merlin arc she gets overpowered by a middle aged witch in a fight that should've been a stomp. In that same fight she doesn't show any feats beyond, say, Dumbledore could've done.

I also wish the author showed the more active parts of her life beyond training other people. Yeah I know training Merlin laid the foundation of magical Britain but all she kinda does in that arc after training him is stay and sit at home and be the sub to Merlin's dom. But I guess the author can't contradict the fact that she isn't a prominent figure without rewriting history itself.

Again, these are just nitpicks and don't really take away from what is otherwise a fantastic story. I just hope it gets updated soon.

****** We don't actually know much about Flamel. He very well could have created the Philosopher's Stone early on in his life then decided to avoid conflict and fighting. We do know though that he somehow kept the stone protected for many, many years, and even though Gringotts was open for about just a bit shorter than Flamel's lifespan, it was in the control of wizards for most of it, so it's possible that he wouldn't have entrusted the stone to them. If so, that means that he must have been at the least a clever and fairly powerful wizard if he managed to live so long and avoid having it stolen.

** I want to tacitly recommend The Boy Who Could Not Die linkffn(The Boy Who Could Not Die).

Short explanation, Harry winds up discovering he is practically invincible and thus literally nothing phases him. Its implied that he is indestructible due to the Horcrux in his head. At one point he talks about diving to the bottom of the ocean and seeing leviathans and sights no other has ever looked at. The humor sort of reminds me of Seventh Horcrux, for obvious reasons.

Too bad it is unfinished, stopped at start of year 2.
