I was thinking about how few fics seem to deal with potential breaches of the statue of secrecy and was putting down a few points about a potential fic where a muggleborn is found to be working with muggle arms dealers as they try to strike back at the lenient sentences handed down after the war. Is the ability to resist the imperius magical or is it purely defined by will-power?


** Canon seems to work from the assumption that resistance to the Imperius is purely defined by willpower. Barty Crouch Jr., while acting as Mad-Eye Moody, said:

#+begin_quote
  The Imperius Curse can be fought ... but it takes real strength of character.
#+end_quote

It does seem to be exceedingly rare to be able to fight the compulsion, however, as none of Harry's classmates managed to do so, not to mention the huge number of adult witches and wizards that have fallen prey to the curse. If I recall correctly, the only other person to have successfully thrown off the Imperius Curse was Barty Crouch Jr. himself.

I wouldn't discount the possibility of magical ability coming into play, however, given that those who have been known to resist it are powerful in their own right. Harry could cast the Patronus at 13, while Crouch overpowered Mad-Eye Moody, a well-known and very paranoid Auror, with only the help of a heavily weakened Dark Lord or Wormtail, if they even did help. Not to mention Confounding the Goblet of Fire, which apparently also required powerful magic.

Or perhaps it is less that magically powerful wizards/witches are able to resist the Imperius Curse, but that wizards/witches with strength of character and willpower tend to be more powerful?

Anyway, I've kind of addressed both sides without really coming to my own conclusion.

So, tl;dr, I don't know if resistance to the Imperius Curse is based on willpower or magical strength, but canon seems to imply that it's based on the former, and personally, I prefer that version, too.

*** Granted, Harry's life has set him up for distrusting instruction from adults. However, most people probably won't get practice at throwing it off either. It seems like the sort of thing you'd be expected to practice against as a Death Eater (and honestly should have been in the Order). I bet a lot of people could get better at it with practice.

** Depends on your headcanon of how the spell itself works, I guess. There is precedent to your idea, as White Squirrel's stories assume that Muggles can become Occlumens.

** I would go with "no".

#+begin_quote
  I decided that, broadly speaking, wizards would have the power to correct or override 'mundane' nature, but not 'magical' nature.
#+end_quote

From Pottermore: Illness and disability

My interpretation is that muggles will always fall before Imperius, but wizards' magical nature allows them to resist it.

** I'd say that only a wizard could throw off the spell by resisting it, but a muggle might be able to resist succumbing to the effects, if they have a strong personality and have experience in resisting pleasure.

The spell enforces its commands by flooding the mind with a feeling of euphoria, so you might only see muggles who are used to functioning while heavily medicated or very drunk able to act differently than commanded. Best bets would be trained monks, religious fanatics, and the occasional warlord.

** I'd say they can, since there seems to be no magic involved in fighting it off. I think however that not knowing they're affected by a curse makes it much more difficult. Muggles fighting the Imperius Curse would probably think they're going mad.

** I read this and I keep forgetting my answer should be strictly based off of canon, but otherwise I'm thinking that if the Muggle in question was from the Assassin's Creed universe then they /could/ be unaffected if they had First Civilization genes- meaning if the Apple of Eden can't effect them, neither should the Imperius Curse.

** If all it takes is strength of mind/will power then I believe any suitably trained special forces operative trained to withstand torture should be able to throw off the Imperius, at least for a while.

** I like crossovers, and read a Sherlock (BBC)/Hermione fanfic where he resisted obliviation, so I assume he might also be able to resist Imperius. I really liked that trope (and can't find the fic now, unfortunately), but it's definitely just an AU, not cannon or even head cannon.

** My headcanon is that resistance to the Imperius is linked to the ability to have, as Terry Pratchett called them, "Second Thoughts" - having a running track of thoughts about your thoughts. Basically, some degree of mindfullness. HP has it likely either due to the scarcrux, or it grew as a result of needing to self-censor his speech and body-language to survive the Dursleys for his entire life.

I can do that myself. The mindfulness. I've had that for almost as long as I can remember.
