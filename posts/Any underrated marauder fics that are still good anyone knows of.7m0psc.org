** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5753105/1/Glass-of-Water][Glass of Water]] by lyin is one that should be more popular, if you haven't read it.

I like it because it doesn't try to do too much and tell the entire story of the Marauders, and instead focuses on the aftermath of the werewolf prank on their friendship. It's Lily POV, but it's mostly about them.

*** I love that author's interpretation of the marauders and that era. She really fleshes out Lily's character too.

** Have you already read The Life and Times? It's a classic.

Also Crossroads is great.

There are so many great marauder fics out there but I feel like most of them are Remus/Sirius.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11993367/1/Crossing-Lines][Crossing Lines]] by plutoplex isn't really Marauders centric, however the plot is centered around them.

Basically, the Weasley Twins are in their 6th year attempting to get their names into the Goblet of Fire since they are not of age yet. Fred and George tried creating something that would age them, however they instead ended up in the Marauder's era. This story is really unique overall though.

  Taking an aging potion was Fred and George Weasley's backup plan for getting past Dumbledore's age line in GoF. Their initial idea, though... Well, finding themselves 18 years in the past was not part of the plan. Marauders era. No bashing.
