I use AO3 and I love the site but I feel like because I write gen, most aren't interested in my stories (or they just suck, could be that too lol). What are some popular sites for posting with similar layouts to AO3?

I tried fanfiction.net but IMO to post is stupidly complicated unless I were to type the whole thing in the box thingie and I don't have patience for that.


** AO3 and FFNet are the two big ones. Are you tagging appropriately in AO3? Some folks have way too many tags and others have none but the character names.

*** Yes, I think so. I have around 15 tags. I'm not sure if that's too many, but they all relate to the story.

**** That's a good amount, but check to see if you're using common tags or if no one will ever find your story using the tag because AO3 only has a few stories with that tag.

** If you want a lot of feedback forums like spacebattles / sufficient velocity are good places.

I don't read HP ff often anymore so i don't know if there are better forums for it.

SB is mainly Worm fanfiction but there are several HP fanfics over there.

**** [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Worm]] is a complete, online, original fiction. It's over a million words and explores what would happen if regular people got superpowers. It's absolutely brilliant, and really looks into the human psyche and morality. Highly recommended.

******* Always good to see someone pick up worm!

I would warn that people on the subreddit are quite bad at tagging spoilers though.

** Maybe try [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com][www.hpfanficarchive.com]] - it's not all smut.

And I have occasionally read stuff on Ficwad.
