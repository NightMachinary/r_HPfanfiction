** Depends on whether or not you expect wizarding culture to conform to modern science. Taxonomy has changed quite significantly in the last few hundred years and the wizarding world may have developed it's own separate method.

That said giants and dwarves appear human so would likely be some variation on Homo Sapiens. Veela on the other hand seem to have a birdlike ancestry so presumably would be aves rather than mammals.

*** Edit: for simplicity's sake, let's say they use modern scientific nomenclature.

Yet they can interbreed so it would seem they're close to mammals than they are velociraptors and/or chickens.

And now I keep seeing Harry calling Gabrielle "my little chickadee" in intimate moments.

**** As I'm pretty sure there are no real cases of two different genera crossbreeding, could be wrong on that though, but I don't think there's an established rule for naming a species resulting from crossbreeding two different genera.

Since Homo refers to basically everything that was near human, all the sapient stuff that looks relatively human probably would get a Homo genus.

Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if Veela were considered Homo Aves (that's assuming they're the only bird people), assuming Lycanthropy caused genetic changes they might also get a similarly uncreative title i.e. Homo Lupus.

***** The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cama_(animal)][cama]]--a hybrid of a camel and a llama, is not only an intergeneric hybrid, but is theoretically fertile because camels and llamas have the same number of chromosomes. Even more distantly-related hybrids have been described, but are extremely rare.

*** I don't think Veela descend from birds; I see their bird-like things as no more indicative of ancestry than being a werewolf or an animagus --- a purely magical talent.

My theory of magical sapient beings is that they are the descendants of tribes of prehistoric "wizards" who used their yet-ill-understood magic to alter themselves over generations, Lamarck-style. Elves became quiet and fleet-footed to hide from large predators and hide effectively, Goblins adapted to cave-dwelling and a life centered on primitive ironwork, Dementors were born Legilimenses who figured out how to steal lifeforce from other humans and evolved until they'd shed nearly all physicality, etc.

Where this lands all of them in human taxonomy is thus very up in the air, since they /didn't/ evolved under Darwinian laws at all in the first place. If pressed, I would consider them new species in the /Homo/ genus.
