Just curious how one may go about finding one, thinking about writing again!


** Hey!

I find the best places are on Facebook groups dedicated to the ship. They are always looking for new content.

You can also ask in fic. I actually beta for someone I now write with because when I read their fic, I saw there was soooo much potential but a lot of errors. I commented and they agreed. Ask in your AN.

Here, I dunno. I've never seen it happen but I've never tried. Depending on the premise, plot, and pairing I might be able to help you. Feel free to pm me.

** If your looking for a beta, I could offer my services if you like (free obv). I'm currently writing my own series (just started) and will need a beta myself before I post (will be a bit though) as I plan on posting my series one complete book at a time rather than a chapter a week or some such. At least for the first book. The follow-up books I'll prob post chapter by chapter but the first book will be complete before release.
