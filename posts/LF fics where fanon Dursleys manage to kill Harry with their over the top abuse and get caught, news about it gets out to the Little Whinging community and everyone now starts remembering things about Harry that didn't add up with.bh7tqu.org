** linkao3(13707582;15207077;16050527;16716980;16732107) is a suicide not murder, but it is really very raw, the author by writing these stories was processing a suicide in his/her own family.

*** I'm sorry but... the writing is awful in these. Like, straight up dire.

  “Yeah, I know” the man raised a hand and pulled off the mask. Underneath it, a young man, no older than thirty-five, looked at him with a pitying expression “The kids are always the hardest, furthermore in abusive backgrounds. You kinda expect their families to... You know” he made a vague gesture with his hand, but then nodded his head towards the body and shrugged “He is not the first nor the last. Unfortunately, this is not all that uncommon and you get accustomed”

It's word salad. The only emotion I felt was the burning desire to go read something else.

**** Yes, and obviously you don't read these for the perfect detached quality of writing, but for the raw authenticity. Besides, it seems that the author is Japanese, and writing eloquent English story is difficult for us English-as-a-second-language authors even on the best days, and obviously time of writing of these stories were not the best days.

***** I don't know about you, but when I read something the quality of the writing is pretty important. I'm not asking for "perfect", I'm asking for the bare minimum in terms of grammar so I'm not reading a mess, and for the author to have a basic grasp on how to describe a scene.

"The man took off his mask, and underneath it was... a man!" is laughably bad writing, and completely robs the scene of any emotional gravitas it may have had.
