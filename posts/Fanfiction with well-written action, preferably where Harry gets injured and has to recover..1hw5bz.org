I feel REALLY lame even asking about this, but I love some good action sequences... Whether it's Harry as an Auror, or if he gets "captured," I enjoy reading well-written violence and action. The issue has been finding action that is well-written and believable. I recently read a fic by Northumbrian that had a good "Captured ! Harry" scene in it that was well-written.

They do seem hard to come by, though.

It doesn't necessarily have to be canon-compliant, though I would prefer that Harry were above the age of 15.

Don't necessarily want Abused!Harry stories unless they are well-written and believable. I am not denying that Vernon may have roughed Harry up more than a few times, but I doubt he would beat him senseless....

If anyone has any suggestions, send them my way!


** Harry Potter and the Conspiracy of Blood. It's a "Third War" novel where Harry almost buys the farm two different times. Full disclosure: I wrote it.

*** I tried this one, and I guess I have difficulty picturing Harry as an old man. There are bits that I loved, though. :) Good story over all!

I enjoyed your one shot about Harry and Ginny and the birth of James. I went through your other stories, as well, because why the heck not? :)

Thanks. If you have any authors you would recommend, send 'em my way! I love Harry/Ginny, and you seem like a good writer. Usually good writers know other good writers! :D

To be honest, I haven't really read much time-travel fanfiction, but I'm enjoying Wastelands. It's good! I might be converted.... :P

This is a great, harsh story focused more on Hermione than Harry, but that choice makes sense- Harry is captured at the beginning. Everyone has to handle some damage; many in ways that are uniquely magical but that make sense.

*** I am enjoying it so far, though I have to say that I find reading H/Hr painful most of the time. I just don't think it's really feasible. (There are a few fics where it has worked, but usually it just seems kind of random to me.)

Overall, I'm enjoying it, though. This is more along the lines of what I was looking for, I suppose, despite the pairing. :) Thank you!

** There's a great one called 'For Love of Family' by Arnel where Harry as an Auror gets seriously injured. Also there it has a really well written mystery about how Harry gets injured and the Auror department handling the case. [[http://siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=129228]]

*** Ohhh, I think I've heard of this one!

*Edit:* I have heard of this one, after all! I think I first came accross it when it had just come out and only had a couple of chapters, then I lost track of it. I found where the author has it posted on Fanfiction.net and will add it to my favorites list!

Thanks for your recommendation. This is exactly what I was looking for. The author's characterizations are spot on, IMO, and I love her depiction of Harry and Ginny's relationships and seeing the relationship between Harry and the Potter kids. This author reminds me a lot of *little0bird*, one of my alltime favorite authors in terms of post-DH fanfiction.

Great, thanks!
