Not necessarily a crossover with Star Wars. I've read fics like linkffn(Revenge of the Wizard) and linkffn(The Voyage of the Starship Hedwig) and I like the idea of Harry and/or people close to Harry going into space to escape a purge of the magi/wizard race. I'd love to read more stories like these.


** linkffn(Browncoat, Green Eyes) is a pretty decent Firefly cross that fits your wizards in space premise

  Immortality is a hell of a lot less fun than it sounds, especially when all you want is to be left alone but your conscience won't let you. Harry Potter and his usual bipolar luck live on into the 22nd century, his saving-people-thing meshing nicely with the galaxy's pressing need for a hero. Rated M for unrepentant coarse language, innuendo, and eventual sexy shenanigans

  Based on The Galactic War challenge by Belgrath on DZ2's forums. During the Battle at the Department of Mysteries, Harry Potter is sent to the Star Wars universe. Arriving two years before Attack of the Clones, this is Harry's story as he grows through the Clone Wars and his return home. An eventual H/Hr, it will develop after harry's return. Not sure which genres to call this one.

*** I love this one. Although I feel like now that they have all the books, especially if there is the fanon interpretation of arithmancy being the math of magic; that the Culture should in theory be all set on how to work magic by them selves. They could also have a Mind teach Harry now from all the stuff in the books, likely much more comprehensively than staying at hogwarts.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

  Fate is a funny thing sometimes. Harry Potter and his friends survived their trial by fire and defeated Voldemort. A year has passed and Hermione Granger is apprenticed as a Curse Breaker. When she discovers an ancient tomb she talks Harry into helping with the excavation. Now they are trapped and they'll need a miracle to survive. HP/BSG with a bit of Stargate in the mix.
