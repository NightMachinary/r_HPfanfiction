So I've seen different people use the word Mudblood differently in their fics. So what do you think the word means in canon and are there any hidden meanings to the word?

For instance, IMO the word Mudblood was possibly used for the first time in the Middle Ages, when Muggles didn't really understand the word hygiene. We know that there are showers and such in Hogwarts so one can presume that personal hygiene has never been a problem for wizarding society. In canon we have Draco Malfoy using the word and Hermione saying that it means "dirty blood" but could you really expect 12 year olds to truly understand the meaning of a word like this? And we all love Hagrid, but lets be honest here, the man isn't exactly a ,magical historian. In fact the only person who's speciality is magical history is Binns and no one pays any attention to him. Can you imagine what the books would have been like with a history teacher who was actually interesting? But Mudblood is IMO, the wizarding equivalent of a racial slur.

The issue here is that it doesn't excuse the usage of the word and it doesn't justify it, but I've always thought that the word Mudblood was a word used by the pureblood supremacists as an insult, yet they did not truly understand the meaning of it. This is probably silly, but I've always thought of the word being used against muggle borns who force their muggle worldview on their fellow wizards. After all why would you expect Muggle logic to work in a world where you can bend reality to your will with but a thought? (it's something many authors do in their fics, going on about "muggle logic" benign superior blah, blah blah which really pisses me off. But that's another argument altogether)

The other problem is that we don't really have any canon references to the differences between wizarding and muggle culture (which is why I love fan fiction, so many possibilities). We only have Harry and hermione' views which are all but useless. Hermione insists on wizardign culture being backwards while harry is one of the worst protagonists I've come across. Yeah I get that he wants to be normal and that's fine, but he discovers a world of magic and what does he do? He complains about homework... are you fucking kidding me???? Yes, this is something that has bothered me since I first read the books as a child. Ron's view is also unreliable as his family are, by his own admission, a bunch of blood traitors.

But as authors and readers and potter heads, what is the significance of the word, "mudblood" in your opinion? I've never really had the opportunity to discuss this with anyone else.


** Wow you're doing some real mental acrobatics there trying to justify your bigoted views of muggles. It literally means your blood is dirty, you're a horrible muggle that's stealing magic compared to our 'pure blood' built upon generations of pure blooded wizards. That's literally all it means.

As for Harry not wanting to do is homework, I mean he's turning a rat into a teacup and making potions used for removing boils. After a while that shit becomes routine. Sure it's fun using the bunsen burner in chemistry the first time but after a while it just becomes routine.

*** I'm not justifying it's usage. As I state above, it's clearly a racial slur and there's no excuse for using a word like that. But rather my question (which, admittedly I haven't explained well due to my tendency to go no tangents) is about the origins of the word and trying to figure out if there's a reason why it's used beyond the obvious ones. Since canon doesn't really explain much about that.

As for harry and homework - he had access to a library full of books about magic. Hermione's character annoys me but she had something right at least - you have this amazing resource, why the hell aren't you using it. Harry's got power to spare (seen in book 3) and he certainly isn't stupid (seen throughout the series). but he is lazy and unwilling to better himself and that's what really pisses me off about his character. I like him of course, but that doesn't mean that I can't have problems with him.

**** There's a lot you can dig into looking for deeper meanings in the canon, I don't think there's any deeper meaning to mudblood. Mud is dirt, bigoted wizards see wizards and witches born from muggle parents as having dirty blood or being worth less than dirt, I don't think there's any deeper significance to it.

Again I'm going to refer to the real world here as an example. Right now you could go to a library and read a book to learn martial arts, or play an instrument, or learn to cook amazing food, or learn basic first aid. These are all attainable skills that can be learned in an effort to better yourself, yet most of the population would never bother to try doing it themselves. Now put that in context to the wizarding world where magic is normalised to the point that witches and wizards use it for everything. Magic still takes effort to learn as you can see when he's trying to learn 'accio' or when people are learning in lessons or the DA. Harry's pretty much a regular teenager who'd rather see his friends or play games or Quidditch than spend his time going to the library looking up spells and teaching himself magic in an attempt to better himself because like I said in my previous post it's all normalised now.

***** Thanks for replying. Yeah, I was hoping that there was more but I guess I was just looking far too much into it (a consequence of too many English classes haha).

Regarding the normalized thing - it certainly explains Ron Weasley, who did take the easy O classes (something that we're all guilty of at some point TBH) but remember that Harry was raised with no exposure to the muggle world at all. Sure I can learn to play an instrument & do martial arts, but that doesn't mean that I won't stop having fun and hanging out with my friends. Studying magic and having fun doesn't have to be mutually exclusive. Again, this is just a pet peeve that I have with Harry.

** I take "Mudblood" to mean more or less the same thing as the N-word. It's an insult against a group of people, stemming from ignorance.

  IMO the word Mudblood was possibly used for the first time in the Middle Ages, when Muggles didn't really understand the word hygiene. We know that there are showers and such in Hogwarts so one can presume that personal hygiene has never been a problem for wizarding society.

#+end_quote

As a side, Hermione in the books didn't know what Mudblood meant, just that it was something bad. It was actually Ron who explained it to her.

I don't think it has anything to do with hygiene, necessarily, and it's not an insult against /Muggles/. It's an insult against Muggle/borns/. To me, it's meant to imply that the Muggle lineage of Muggleborns somehow sullies the purity of magic, hence the term Pureblood.

Now this is interesting when you think about it, and to be perfectly honest the topic of the origin of things like magic (how did the first people to use magic come into this world, why do they have a problem with Muggles, etc.) is something that is completely nonexistent in canon, and so you can explain it however you like in terms of fanfiction.

That being said, ignoring my own personal take on it, I believe it's likely that all Pureblood families originate from Muggleborns if you look back far enough, and the term Mudblood is just something the first magical communities came up with in order to justify not including Muggleborns in their midst. It's likely that there was no concept of keeping magic a secret thing in the early ages, which furthered conflicts between Wizards and Muggles. Muggleborns, caught in the middle of it, were probably shunned by both parties.

Overall though, this is complete conjecture that is simply not dealt with in canon at all.

It's been a while since I've read the books, but did any of the characters ever really talk about Wizarding culture that much? Was the topic of discrimination ever addressed beyond "Malfoy called Hermione a Mudblood, let's beat him up"? I don't recall.

#+begin_quote
  he discovers a world of magic and what does he do? He complains about homework... are you fucking kidding me????
#+end_quote

Worth pointing out that several books make it a point on the first page of the first chapter to make it clear that Harry very much enjoys doing homework.

To sum it up, it's all up in the air! "Mudblood" is an insult, just like "faggot" or other such words. How did it come to be, what does it actually mean? As far as I know, we're never given a clear explanation.

Further demonstrating, as you say, the many fascinating aspects of fanfiction.

*** Ah what I meant with the hygiene thing was that the wizards would have seen the mugs as lesser beings who lived in filth. Thus, to them, children born from such "filth" would have blood that's quite obviously dirty - hence mudblood. Though that is of course, speculation on my part.\\
But yeah, I'm definitely interested in the origins of magic. and I may have mixed up Ron's complaints with Harry's... but I was just really surprised that he never tried to learn more about the world he entered. Yes he did have "the living encyclopedia" a.k.a. Hermione Granger there, but I just don't see him learning on his own without outside influence.

After reading Forging the Sword, by Myst Shadow, I found that the quote in the first chapter summed up most of my thoughts to the letter:

“When Voldemort was 16 he was becoming immortal, when his Harrys dad was 15 he could already do silent spells, when Snivellus was 16 he was inventing spells and creating new ways of making potions, when Draco bloody Malfoy is 16, not only can he do occulemency, but he made up a plan that lead to the death of one of the most powerful wizards in the world. Heck, even Peter was an animagus when he was what, 15, 16. What the hell is Harry doing?

Thats the crux of the matter, isn't it. All this time Harry hasn't tried to better himself, yet he has all these examples of wizards beginning to show greatness at the same age as he. Dumbledore can be added to the list above, remember the O.W.L. examiner said that she saw Dumbledore do things with a wand in his exam that she had never seen before? Harry seems unmotivated and unwilling to work, or even to try to gain anything - power, greatness, or just vengeance on his parent's murderer.”

But again, that's a very different argument. I guess I'm just a little too excited to be able to discuss this with others, I have been quite slow in adapting to reddit.

***** The triwizard tournament was rigged. He doesn't teach a good portion of the school, just to a few students in his year along with 2 5th year raven laws and the remainder of the Gryffindir quod ditch team with a few younger Gryffindir students. It was more of a study group for OWLS than angry of else and he taught them spells that they should already know.

I admit that it wasn't all bad and it was impressive, but no more than heading up your own club in school. That said, my issue with him is his lack of motivation to do anything magically. Remember, at 15-16 Tom Riddle had already begun gathering his followers around him and was making full use of the Slug Club.

The DA is a good achievement, but it's not that impressive when it comes to magical growth as stated above. Also James Potter and his friends created a working map of the school that showed everyone's locations on it.\\
As stated my MystShadow and the commenter above, the biggest issue here is Harry's lack of motivation to better himself. I don't need him to be a great big hero, not in the traditional sense. He doesn't have to be the next Achilles or Odysseus but I can't accept his laziness at all. But again, that's just a personal problem I have with him.

** I've always considered "mudblood" to be similar, though more offensive, to "up jumped". The old pureblood families seem to view themselves as nobility and thus superior to muggles. This parallels quite closely to how actual nobles of Europe viewed commoners as little as 100 years ago if not still to this day. If you were/are a noble you are of value, everyone else is not worth their notice and there to prop up the nobility. First generation nobles were often looked at with disdain and not considered to be true nobility. They were thought to be intruding somewhere where they aren't wanted and don't belong. It's the same with muggleborns. "You weren't born to this so you don't belong".

That's some full-throttle blood supremacist apologism right there. You don't need to interpret canon like that to write your AU wizarding culture stories. Just don't pretend there is something noble or misunderstood about threatening people with ethnic cleansing, or the whole thing will look really stupid.

Because face it. The term means your blood is dirty and you shouldn't be allowed to exist, let alone breed, least you dirty the entire magical world with your very existence. This is even echoed by Aunt Marge, the worst non-magical person in the series (which is saying a lot). It isn't subtle.

They are direct Nazi analogs, nothing less. One of their first actions when in power (and no, that wasn't a Death Eater run campaign, it was blood supremacists) was to round people up based on their heritage and politics and put them in death camps.

It's really simple and straightforward. No misunderstandings to be had in that part of canon.

*** Shit forgot to add "this seems silly but I've always thought of the ORIGINS of the word's usage against muggleborna began..." As in you had the witch hunts going on in those days. I'm quite sure that they had muggleborns coming in calling witchcraft the devil's work, etc. hence mud blood- born with magical ability yet attempting to place muggle world views on the magical world. I Put in a modern example to make it more understandable.

As I say later on, this is the wizarding equivalent of a racial slur IMO.

But I kinda hoped that there would be more to it but, again, I wanted to hear how other people thought about the word.

Thiugh I am confused by one thing in ur comment, why are u talking about death eaters not running the Nazis? I thought Grindelwald's people were in charge of that.

Talking about the word mudblood and the Nazis, I would notcompare the two as Grindelwald and Dunbledore's campaign was about the eradication of muggles not muggleborns. They were all about magicals not bowing down to non-magical folk.\\
I'd say the mudblood has more in common with the word N----- as both, as you said, attempt to completely marginalize the existance of a race of people. Not that they are equal of course, but if I had to compare mudblood to a real racial slur that's the comparison I would choose. Not the nazis

about that, do we know what Grindelwald's forces were called?

Nothing is said of Grindelwald's relationship to Nazis in canon. And that's not what I meant.

In book seven, when Voldemort took power through a puppet government and allowed the blood supremacists like Umbridge free reign, Muggleborn and political undesirables were rounded up. She set up death camps.

Some of the Death Eaters were also Snatchers, but in the book at least there were never shown enough DEs to run the whole thing and do anything else. It was run, at least in part, by bigoted pure-blood wizards, some of whom must have (for example) been guards and administrators, an echo of what happened in Nazi Germany. Umbridge was, WoG, never a Death Eater, and my guess would be never were most of the people involved in the post-Scrimgeour administration.

Death Eaters, as well as the blood supremacists, were morally unredeemable, and ultimately shown in canon for the vile and evil creatures they were. An all too common and human variety of evil. While it is fun to play "find the middle ground" in an AU sense, in canon they were evil. Full stop.

There was no "maybe they WERE stealing magic" angle to play, and even the "Muggles will find out about magic and kill us" was never presented as an argument to hate and fear first generation magicals. It was never even hinted that they had a sympathetic point at all. They were just bad guys, from the start to the end, and only their family relationships even came /close/ to redeeming any of them. In fact, if I recall correctly Narcissa (WoG) wasn't actually a Death Eater, and was never marked. And she only sorta redeemed her family.

The reason I jumped down your throat was you seemed to be making up weird lexicographic history and cultural mores, all unsupported and without argument from canon. You're doing it again. Which is fine, but at least say clearly you're looking for some AU chatting, not well-supported fanon to fill the gaps.

***** Thanks for replying, I appreciate it. And yeah I definitely should have mentioned that I wanted to talk about the wizarding world beyond what we see in canon. That's my mistake and I'm slowly getting used to reddit and this sort of discussion so sorry about that!

Now firstly, thanks for reminding me about canon - I completely forgot about the hole "stealing magic" scenario which, even when i read it, made no sense to me. As in, how could people actually accept that, especially as there were ministry workers who weren't death eaters. But yeah, the Nazi germany thing makes sense there, but the issue is that Wizarding Britain did not go through the same things as Germany in real life (aka the Treaty of Versailles - that set up Hitler's rise to power. Of course, this is just one theory, but again this issue is hampered by the fact that the books are for children while the world is just so much more).

Now as to the whole muddled thing. I certainly agree that canon death eaters have no redeeming qualities (people can argue for Snape but it doesn't change that he was a horrible teacher and person).

And yeah the Muggleborns were certainly the canon equivalent of the Jews IRL.

But again, the biggest issue I have when it comes to discussing stuff is making the black-white morality that JKR created for us and trying to see the wizarding world from an adult's perspective... does that make sense? I'm afraid that I'm not being very eloquent here.

Which is why I was hoping that there was more to the blood purity issue than what I remember for canon, but (and you actually helped me here) from what I recollect it's very black and white which doesn't sit very well for me. Does that make sense? Of course, Harry potter is written for children but the world JKR create is a place where even adults can play around in, I think... which is of course why we're all here having this discussion.

Hope this rambling comment made sense haha. Also please excuse any typos, I'm all thumbs.

The stealing magic thing was literally one sentence, perhaps even a throwaway one. We don't really see /why/ blood supremacists think they way they do, but their actions speak for themselves.

Look into the attitudes in places like Austria during WWI (that's the "Great War", not World War II). People around the world, the majority of them perhaps, /genuinely/ thought that people from certain areas were significantly worse human beings. Not just morally, for cultural reasons, but physically and mentally. That sort of racism wasn't just a thing Nazis came up with. This again hints that the wizarding world is very backward when it comes to human rights.

If you want a quick real-world review of this sort of thing, and how even normal seeming people can get caught up in such ideas, check out something like period film [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Remains_of_the_Day_(film)][The Remains of the Day]] or the historic films on the YouTube channel [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FgaL0xIazk][The Great War]]. I like looking at these issues during WWI because Nazis cloud everything, and it isn't like these attitudes disappeared. It isn't just about Muggleborn being treated like the Jews were by Nazis, it's an older way of thinking about class and race, one the Nazis perfected and industrialized.

This is the level of racism expressed in Death Eaters, and to a slightly lesser extent in blood supremacists. This is a black and white issue. There is no middle ground. Someone who thinks a group of people don't deserve the same rights because of circumstances of birth are against all that is good and civilized that humanity has created. By showing their fear and misunderstanding of non-magicals, JKR presents even normal wizards as being right on the edge of this sort of hatred and fear. That's one of the reasons a large minority of fanfiction authors seem to think the wizarding world is kinda shit, even when not ruled by pseudo-Nazis.

That it took a group of schoolchildren and their families to finally stand up and fight against the country's almost literal Hitler strongly suggests Voldemort's rule wasn't exactly being opposed on all fronts by the wizarding world--just like in Nazi Germany.

#+end_quote

JKR wrote a world from an adult perspective. The story takes place with moderately well modeled child characters' points of view of daily events, but that doesn't mean what they saw was wrong.

Sometimes, groups of people just hold absolutely evil ideas. Often, this is the end result of fear and misunderstanding, but that doesn't make their views somehow acceptable. You don't need to be oppressed by losing a war to be racist shits, and that's what blood supremacists are. There is no excuse, only explanations, for attempted ethnic cleansing.

Apologists just look stupid writing stories trying to say, "but their culture is under attack!", as if that makes the genocide excusable. But is nothing "cooler" and more "hard core" and counter-culture than sympathy for the devil, so that's what the brooding Internet tough-guys will continue to write and argue for. Explaining away using a racial slur is the tip of this problem.

******* [This is really long, but you can just scroll down for the TL;DR section if you want. Sorry!]

So, regarding the stealing magic scenario, what made no sense to me is how they could come to that solution. But of course, we aren't exactly dealing with rational people here are we?

The problem with the whole rights issue in the wizarding world is interesting but it's, again, not really touched on as much due to the relative age of our main characters. Now I'm not talking about the death eater vs. muggleborn thing of course, but iirc we don't get a look at what rights pureblood wizards have that muggleborns don't (please correct me if I'm wrong but we get a lot of werewolf rights and house elves of course, but nothing on what rights muggleborns have legally. Which, again, is perfectly understandable as we get all of this from Harry's perspective). Sorry I've gone on a bit of a tangent, but it's an issue I'd like to see explored more - i.e. learn more about.

Of course, culturally there're so many problems, imagine going to Hogwarts as a muggleborn character - you're thrust into this whole strange world at 11 and you suddenly find that there's a whole group of people who hate you for being born. So yeah, certainly the wizarding world is a very scary place for a muggleborn. I think that you have fics where they have some "muggleborn" orientation thing but I don't recall anything of that sort being in canon (again, please correct me if I'm wrong).

Now the one thing I don't agree with you about is the whole adult perspective thing. Now of course, what they see may not be wrong, but take for instance the house of Slytherin. From Harry's perspective, the house is full of bigots, gits, etc. I'm not talking about the epilogue and the end of book 7 where you have Harry realizing that, but I'm talking about having 6 full books where you don't see any decent people in that house. But can you truly have a single house full of people who are all pureblood supremacists? We even have proof that this is not true seen in Severus Snape (another character who's delightfully complex). I'd say that Slughorn fits in that category, but he comes of more as well-meaning, but condescending. Now don't get me wrong, there wasn't really any big reason for Harry to befriend slytherins in canon, in fact he is strongly discouraged from doing so in the very beginning. "There wasn't a wizard that went bad in Slytherin" But can you truly say that we have an entire house that is full racist fanatics?

This is where I like to make a distinction - I'm not apologizing for the death eaters, as I've said above, "mudblood" a racial slur and there really isn't any excuse for it. But can you say that there weren't any Slytherins at all in the Order of the Phoenix? (Snape notwithstanding). We don't know of course, this is not mentioned in canon, but it's an issue that remains unexplained.

I certainly agree with you on the counter-culture and I never really understand the stories where Harry joins Voldemort - the guy's mother is muggleborn and died protecting him ffs. I'm not talking about making their views acceptable but how they originated. my question was about whether or not there's more to the word. And (unfortunately, since I'm on my phone, I mis-typed the word "originated" which was autocorrected into something else) why and how did the word originate? I couldn't remember there being anything in canon about it, which is why I asked the question here.

[Now please keep in mind that the next (and final part) is not about canon, but world-building.]

The Death Eaters are a group of right-wing political extremists that took power. But the Death Eater movement(?) could not have existed if there wasn't a (traditionalist???? nationalist??) movement/ political group that already existed. Voldemort took these guys and turned them into fanatics. This isn't canon but drawn from real world examples. For a radical group like the death eaters to exist, there has to be a political ideology/ group that is against having muggleborns (essentially immigrants) entering the wizarding world. These people would not talk about killing muggleborns but rather limiting the influence of muggles.

For instance, where are Hermione's parents when their daughter is lying in a hospital bed, petrified, for quite some time? Would any good parent not want to see their daughter? So either they are negligent (doubtful) or they were not informed as they're muggles. Hermione, Colin Creevey, Justin F. were all muggleborn students and were all petrified. So where the hell where their parents? Penelope Clearwater may the only exception, but we don't receive any information regarding her parentage in canon. Prof. McG. seems like a decent woman, but what if she wasn't allowed to inform the muggleborn parents of what had happened to their children? Do you really think that Hermione's parents would have let her come back to school if they knew about what happened to her in her second (or even her first) year? This points to the proof that there had to be something preventing the parents of muggleborn students from "interfering" further in the magical world. We know that Dumbledore could not have been against informing their parents about what was going on he is known universally as a "muggle lover."

So you're mistaken that I brought up the whole issue of "protecting our culture" as a way of excusing what the Death Eaters were doing. It's silly as this is all in my head but you can't have an extremist group like the Death Eaters popping up without the existence of some "traditionalist" (for the lack of a better term) group before.

The word mudblood may have been coined by the extremists, but you can't have a government made up of reasonable people and Death Eaters, that makes no sense whatsoever. You have to account for people in the middle and all over. Many dictatorships have risen due to nationalist groups being radicalized by would-be dictators (Hitler, Castro) and going on to take over the country - which is what we see happening in book 7.

So let me clarify this issue, once more. It's not about apologizing for Death Eaters, but trying to figure out what the people in the middle are thinking. It's about understanding how the word muddled came about and since I couldn't remember if there was any reference to this in canon, I asked this question hoping that there might be something about the politics of the wizarding world that I've missed or something on pottermore.

TL;DR - sorry for the ridiculously wrong response. But basically, I agree with you whole heartedly, but you are mistaken in that I'm not trying to apologize for the death eaters, but trying to see what the "traditionalist wizard" would think of the issue. Someone not in Dumbledore's camp but not a death eater. You can't have an extremist movement like the death eaters popping up without there being some sort of "traditionalist" movement/ group in the background.

I thought that the word was used originally because these people were afraid of muggle culture and felt that muggleborns weren't respecting the culture they had adopted. I never said that this makes sense or that it's right but I was using it to give an example. Now don't get me wrong, this is my fault as I wasn't clear enough with my main question, but I am new to the whole online forum thing, so thank you for your patience and detailed replies.

So I have one final question, what did you mean by "But is nothing "cooler" and more "hard core" and counter-culture than sympathy for the devil, so that's what the brooding Internet tough-guys will continue to write and argue for." ? I'm not asking because I didn't understand what you're saying, but rather because I don't have a frame of reference. Could you please give me an example of two of that? Like a genre of fan fiction for instance. Sorry, but I'm new to the hpfanfiction culture, hence my ignorance regarding existing arguments.

A Muggle rights bill being passed was a big thing happening behind the scenes in book two. This suggests a majority of democratic support for passing laws that aren't totally unreasonable. Of course, it is 1992 and such things are still being passed, which means that is a new thing or the balance of power is very close.

My guess is, the wizarding world made up of a very few "pure" half-bloods, or people born to magicals married to Muggles (like Snape's parents, or like Dean's mom); a minority of Muggle-born; an even larger minority of pure-bloods with mostly a sort of vague sympathy to blood supremacists but also a few fanatics; and a plurality of average people with few if any Muggle-born in their family tree, a few half-bloods maybe, and who don't think much about it either way.

#+end_quote

I meant that there is a lot of shitty fanfic where people try to distance themselves from the original material in the name of both self-proclaimed "realism" and to show they aren't like the stereotypical fanfiction writing housewives and bronies. In proving their Internet machismo, they often make really violent, sexist, and racist stories, where bashed characters are shown the error of their ways and Death Eaters are simply protecting the rights of wizarding culture. The KKK's argument, basically. Gets right up my nose. I'll not be linking any, but they're all over ffn and some of the smaller sites.

That attitude has also infected otherwise decent stories, making the idea that Muggle-born are being stupid not to adopt wizarding culture a common Slytherin-Harry trope. It also often features in Azkaban fics, where Harry learns the poor oppressed Death Eaters were the good guys all along.

It is usually done really poorly. For an example of it *not* being done poorly, check out linkffn(11251745). Not only does it have a female-Harry and a realistic same-sex relationship in a romance fic, it has old magic actually being interesting, and /progressives/ (NOT Muggle-born, but pure-bloods like Dumbledore) wanting the old magic suppressed. Most of that is in the later chapters, so you might have to read some to get there. It underlies the entire story, however.

*Trigger warnings*: frank and positive discussions of classic (not Tumblr) feminism and feminist theories. Positive authorial treatment of same-sex relationships. Girl power.

This is a conflict point, however, and this fic's magical world is about right for the 1800s when it comes to human rights, i.e. not great. A good read. Check it out.

********* Cool I usually stay away from the femHarry stuff apart from one shots but I'll give it a try. I don't have anything against gender bender fics but I guess I have some difficulty relating with the characters u know?

Yeah never really got the whole: Harry becomes a death eater thing (though I will admit to having read a few Harry Bella fics as a guilty pleasure. Like Delenda Est) thanks for explaining what u meant! And yeah I've definitely come across a few of those fics. Don't get me wrong, I like Harry using the dark arts (Whispers by Perspicacity) but usually to take down Voldemort. "The dark lord shall mark him as his EQUAL" not "opposite" u lnow?

  On the other hand, *wizards can say they are the master race* because muggles literally can't perceive important matters of existence, and they have the ability to modify reality at a whim.

Actually, if you read what I wrote, I didn't talk about hating non-magicals. I talked about hating those /born/ to non-magicals. The Mudbloods. Please stay on subject.

  You can argue morals all you want, but you can't directly apply real world ethics and science to the wizarding world (like J.K kind of did).

  ...

  ...can you justify allowing something insignificant like personal liberty and "love" to hamper the arguably *greatness strength of the Earth*?
#+end_quote

Okay, fuck staying on subject. That argument has absolutely no support in canon or reality, is pure personal fanon about wizards, is unscientific, is poorly formed and irrational, and last of it all /disgusts/ me.

No, don't bother replying, I'm not arguing against magical family planning and segregating the races for the good of the Earth and */fucking Nazi fucking eugenics/* with some goddamn ignorant wanker on a Harry Potter forum on Christmas. That's just too fucking weird.

I will be charitable and assume you are inexperienced and stupid, Mr. "SniperGW," given your earlier acknowledgement of Nazi plans as pseudo-science, and take as given that you genuinely haven't thought about why that's a revolting, irrational, and illogical argument for a civilized and scientifically-minded person to make. So I'll leave it at that. If you bring this shit out in my sight again, however, it will get messy.

And to the rest of you /actual thinking human beings/--Merry Christmas, ya filthy animals.

***** Why is that actually? I don't think we get an explanation in canon - do we know if they're called half-bloods or something? I thought that half-blood was a child between a pureblooded wizard and a muggle/muggleborn. Which is kinda weird because how do you get a pureblood anyway? Or maybe that's a pureblood - the child of two muggleborns - that's how all the wizarding families started anyway right?

****** Half-blood in canon is a witch/wizard with one witch/wizard parent (the pedigree of which is never specified) and one muggle/muggleborn parent. Which begs the question of what the child of two muggleborns would be called. A quarter-blood?

As for pure-bloods, I read somewhere that all eight great grand parents had to be magical but I think that is fanon. It's not in the books at least iirc but maybe JKR said it somewhere.
