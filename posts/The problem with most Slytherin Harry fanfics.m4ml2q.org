I absolutely love Slytherin Harry fanfics. But I hate it when Harry becomes friends with the Slytherins waaay too fast. I've read so many fanfics where the Slytherins are openly blood purists yet Harry becomes friends with them in 5 minutes without any growth on their part. I'm always rooting for Hermione to stop being friends with him altogether because even if he doesn't agree with the blood purity concept, he's basically excusing their behavior by being friends with them. What are your thoughts?


** I'd say I mostly agree with you unless it's a pointedly dark!Harry fic. If he hates muggles because of the dursleys and thinks that all muggleborns should be adopted out to pureblood families and magic should be 100% segregated from muggle society even in the case of muggleborns I can see that specific fanfic version of Harry befriending the slytherins in about 5 minutes. Other than that, I agree it should take a while otherwise Harry comes across as sympathetic to pureblood supremacy.

** I root for him to not be friends with Hermione to start with. While I don't want to read about Harry being a cackling blood purist dipshit that's cruel to her as far as I'm concerned it kinda ruins the entire point of a Harry goes to Slytherin fic when he acts no different than canon and reforms the “Golden Trio” with Neville replacing Ron by chapter three after a trite speech about how Houses shouldn't dictate your friends and if they work together they can reform the House of Snakes.

*** Yeah that makes sense. l love Hermione's character in canon, so I tend to read fanfics where Harry's still friends with her despite being in different houses. But it is more realistic and probably better for them not to be friends at all, unless it's a re-sorting fanfic where Harry is resorted into Slytherin in like 5th year or something.

** Biggest problem with slytherin Harry fics is that they are never completed. Im tired of reading first couple of years and when we get to interesting parts, The fic gets abandoned

** I agree with Sesc that Harry should grow into a blood purist, but I think if those Slytherins were nice to him and he found them acceptable, he would largely ignore their behavior. Because that is what canon Harry did with Fred and George until he grew into a person comfortable enough to practice spells on Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle.

** I think it could be very realistic. Harry very quickly soaked up Ron and Hagrid's belief that all Slytherins are bad so I feel like with a few changes to canon at the beginning- e.g. not going into Ron's carriage- he could just as easily turn against Gryffindors or Muggleborns. He's never had any friends before so he could latch onto whoever was first nice to him and then be fiercely loyal from there. Something like [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18167759?view_full_work=true][this]] fem!Harry fic:

#+begin_quote
  “We could introduce you to some others," Adrian proposed, "you don't want to mix with the wrong crowd."

  /Diagon Alley was all marvel and magic and her heart was a soaring bird, then the pale boy with expensive robes and a pointy face continued speaking; "but they were our sort, weren't they- I never understood why they'd let that other crowd in- they're just not the same-")/

  Harry paused.

  Remembered their initial judgement on sight alone. Wondered with a chilling suspicion about the other crowd.

  Then thought of the new world and her hopes and ideas and a future of dreams and opportunities and she didn't want to be alone. Not anymore. Never again. She wanted to belong and be somebody. (Not the little phantom inside the cupboard.)

** ... I'm always hoping he doesn't become friends with Hermione to begin with.

But yes, I agree there could be better character arcs. Assuming we do start out with a canonish-Harry, it should take time for him to grow into a blood purist.

  The war drags on after Voldemort's defeat and the Order of the Phoenix is fighting a losing battle. When Harry is hit by yet another killing curse, he wakes up years in the past and in an alternate reality. As an unknown child in a foreign world, Harry has a chance to change the outcome of the war - while dealing with new magical talents, pureblood politics and Black family drama.

**** Hermione starts distancing herself in the last few chapters to make friends with her Muggle-born peers but the fic was abandoned after that.
