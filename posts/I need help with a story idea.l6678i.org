I have not started too far into the planning yet, but I'm considering having a prodigal version of Uzumaki Naruto from the Naruto Franchise reincarnate into Harry Potter when he gets Death's Cloak for Christmas.

I know Naruto was an awesome ninja at the end of Naruto and became the seventh Hokage in Boruto but if he has been able to actually read the information on the clone jutsu he learned from the Forbidden Scroll in episode one then maybe he would have realized that he could use it to advance his studies.

I also think he could have been able to learn how to use D-Ranks as a way to learn self improvement. So maybe studying under a few craftsmen while under henge would have been interesting in my opinion. Then he could grow his own food, repair his water heater, and fix up his apartment building. I also think it will be interesting to see a ninja who cares about their money enough to keep a makeshift ledger on him at all times.

However, like the above mentions, shadow clones can rapidly advance his growth rate. I'll need to slow that down so I have an idea of making each group of learning clones be minimized to 5 members studying. They also have to be studying the same topic to retain information easier.

His Transformation Jutsu in his last life is solid, but maybe forbidding animal transformations due to the anatomy required to do so and the fact that he can explode, which his clones find out the hard way.

As for his substitution, there should be a range that he needs to pick from in order to substitute with a log. And maybe no people-switch-with-me substitutions.

I want to set limitations on him that are realistic to the setting, but can advance to what he is used to. Muscle Memory will have to be relearned, though if he tries hard enough he can learn to cast spells wandlessly. Even with typical jutsu Ninja usually call out the name to strengthen their focus.

I will have him only wake with the ability to use the academy three, listed above, fuinjutsu or ninja runes and arithmancy, plus record keeping skills.

Does anyone know of any other limitations I will have to set.
