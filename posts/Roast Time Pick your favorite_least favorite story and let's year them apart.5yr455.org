** No. There is enough drama and negativity in this sub as it is. We don't need to add to it.

** Let's 'year' your post apart first.

  let's year them apart!

- I don't know what 'yearing' something apart means. Please enlighten me Barry Allen.

  Even the best stories/authors have some flaes

- I presume you meant to say fleas. No. I don't think most writers have fleas. But it sure looks like you might have some for being bitch enough to post a thread wanting to tear down people for putting their hard work out there for a group of strangers to judge.

  PS don't tear down the authors too much, we need their contributions to keep the community as active as it is.

- Yes you do. And if you don't have the guts to back up the post you made intending to hate on people, then don't post it. Get a spine or get out.

Did that feel bad? Did you get even the slightest twinge of guilt? Savour that feeling you have now, and then think to yourself about how you wanted to use this post to give that exact feeling multipled by 100 to people who actually bothered to work hard and spend time on their projects. And if you still think that this is a good idea, then by goodness feel free to roast as many people and stories you want to roast.
