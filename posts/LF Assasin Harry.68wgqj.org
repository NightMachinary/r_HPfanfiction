So, I just read A Wand, Knife, Silence, and now I really want to read more Assasin!Harry now. Preferably 50k+ and complete, or was updated some time in 2017.


** What I'd like to see is an assassin story where it isn't Harry who's an assassin. Keep the characterisations canon, and have the person who hires the assassin be Ginny. She's vengeful and willing to do criminal acts to protect the ones she loves (her family, harry, and friends). It's within her characterisation to pay one to take care of mid level threats she hears about.

So, Seventh Year, she meets one through Aberforth at his pub and has him hunt down snatchers. The story told through the assassins eyes.

*** I think you're referring to linkffn(Deprived by the Crimson Lord)

Personally I find linkffn(HP and the Sun Source by Clell65619) to be more fun, but then it's meant to be cracky.

  This is an extremely AU crossover fic that asks the question what might have happened if Petunia Dursley hadn't found a young Harry Potter sleeping on her doorstep on the morning of the 2nd of November 1981. After all, Dumbledore was a bit careless with
