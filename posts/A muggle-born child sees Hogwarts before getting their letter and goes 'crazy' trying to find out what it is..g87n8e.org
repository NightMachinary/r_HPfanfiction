Edit: I'll admit I probably didn't word this prompt very well, so I'll add a bit more about what I had in mind.

Yes, I know castles are common in Europe, but I still don't think it's unreasonable to assume that a child gets excited easily would point it out to his parents.

About the idea that the kid would go 'crazy' - I meant it in a way that s/he would become a bit obsessed with wanting/trying to find out why s/he could see a magnificent castle and the parents could only see a pile of ruins.


** Why?

Castles aren't that uncommon in europe, you can find one on every other outcropping or cliffside if you're looking for them. A lot are inhabited too.

Not to mention, it's a kid. Kid sees castle and thinks "hey, cool, castle!", the end.

Why would they "go insane" or "try to find out what it is"?

*** („Why is it, that only I can see this beautiful castle?“, mumurs the 7 year old, „why can't my parents go near it?“) or something like that. I think the point is that the muggleborn, as he doesn't now magic is real, thinks he's going crazy because his parents don't believe him, that there is a magnificent castle. So what is it about this build that makes it unapproachable for his/her parents. It makes some sense if you look deeper into the stuff of the HP-Universe

**** No kid says something like that. They'll say "hey ma, look, a castle!" and then they mom and dad are repelled by the charms and drag them away.

The end.

A kid doesn't wonder aloud at the beauty of this castle, and they wouldn't feel the need to specifically state that it's an /intact/ castle either.

**** The other thing. How would a muggle born see the castle? The entire place is hidden from muggles, they can't even get close.

****** Yeah, but how? No roads to Hogsmeade. Wizards don't drive. The train is only accessible through a magic only platform. No maps exist of the area as it's unplottable. The surrounding woods are a death trap.

Now finding the leaky cauldron or St Mungo's or the ministry, sure. Those are high traffic areas for both sides.
