When interrogated, they confirm they are called Ginny Weasley and Colin Creevey and they are trying to get more members for their Harry Potter fan-club.


** Just gonna leave this here.

Harry grumbled as he pulled on the toga sash, actually managing to feel more uncomfortable than in those stuffy dress robes. The ridiculous golden wreath they had shoved around his (permanent) bed head made itself known as he tried to untangle it from his hair, wincing at the pinch.

Harry was normally a pretty calm guy, outside of the life threatening adventures, he liked to take things slow and content. However, after Ginny and Colin had pulled their stunt, he had began a mental essay about the many uses of the cutting curse.

Really, he scoffed as he shifted his feet in the most uncomfortable sandals ever created, if you don't want to be murdered, don't make your friend the /god/ of a /cult/. Because it's one thing to turn an already creepy fanclub into a /worldwide cult/, and another thing to /kidnap him and force him to be a deity infront of some crazed muggles/.

Their reasoning wasn't any better.

Ginny was the one who started it, but when she got Colin on board is when it started going down hill. She had read in the old Black library that the power of belief was what made the super powerful wizards like Voldemort and Dumbledore, their followers were what gave them the power. The entire fanclub at Hogwarts had been on board, and it absolutely spiraled from there.

They actually took it to the muggle world, and were predictably arrested for underage sorcery. The problem was, it. Had gained. A /following/.

They were obsessed! The videos had spread so fast it was impossible to get rid of them, and now the whole bloody muggle world was just as interested in Harry Potter as the wizarding world. And according to the two walking dead people, shoving them infront of the crazies was the best course of action! "The more belief, the more magic!" Harry was going to hurt them.

The worst part was that they were actually /right!/" since this stupid cult (he refused to call it a religion) had started, his energy had been off the charts! It had gotten to the point where a light /aguamenti/ flooded a classroom! Harry had stopped using magic unless he absolutely had to, which led to a build up of so much magic in his system he was /glowing/.

Not. Helping. His. Case.

And speak of the brats themselves, Ginny and Colin came from behind the curtain.

"Lord Harry, they are waiting."

"I told you to stop calling me that! Let me go back to Hogwarts you deranged bastards, I told you I don't want anything to do with this!"

"Oh my Lord, you're so funny sometimes." Ginny giggled, Harry scowled.

"I will eat your babies."

"You should wait until you reach your full power before trying the Lovecraftian stuff, Lord Harry." Colin chirped, unaffected.

Harry paled at the suggestion.

"Come now, may you bless the world with your presence!"

Merlin's saggy nutsack he hated his life.

*** Harry playing the sane man routine while surrounded by loyal crazy fanatics who think his every word or action means something sacred would be a fun read. It would be funny as well if Ginny knows that this is BS but just wants to see how crazy this can go.

*** That was funny. Would love it if someone developed on the story. Also your idea that the belief increases one's magical capabilities is an interesting concept and could be applied in those fics which have the ancient gods as wizards or witches who used their powers to raise themselves to the status of gods.
