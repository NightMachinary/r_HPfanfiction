** Wands were pulled. The three stood pointing wands at each other like a Mexican standoff.

"I don't like you, Ron." Harry growled, "I know that you're only after my inheritance."\\
"Well, I don't like you either, Harry." Ron growled back, "Every Weasley's had to work hard to get where we are, and you just fall into money and fame!"\\
Hermione huffed, "I can't believe either of you. House-elves are slaves, giants are on the verge of destruction, and you two are being all selfish!"\\
"It's Dobby's business who he wants to serve, Granger." Harry answered coldly.\\
"If you care so much about magical creatures, go have a romp with centaurs and stop being such a bossyboots." Ron added.

And then Draco Malfoy appeared, and drew his wands, "Hmph. Mudblood, blood traitor. And being rich doesn't make you special, Potter."\\
And then Neville Longbottom appeared, "Look at all the high and mighty twits. I bet none of you have ever done an honest day's work with the ground, it's all patents and highly-paid dragon wrangling with you lot, isn't it?"\\
And then Filch appeared, packing a bazooka to compensate for his Squibbishness, "Darn kids, get off my lawn!"

*** From behind the bushes, Voldemort gave a high, cold laugh and rubbed his snaky, long-fingered hands together. "The Horcruxes have done their job," he murmured. "They have sown the seeds of dissent among the Undesirables. Soon they will be too busy fighting amongst themselves to stand against me!"

Voldemort's laughter was interrupted by a dismissive snort.

"You mean /us,"/ said the man at his side. Barely even a man at that---he was young, with glinting dark eyes and wavy hair that fell over his elegantly arched brows in a boyish fashion. /"We're/ the ones doing all the work."

"No," said Voldemort, his slit-like nostrils flaring. "I meant what I said."

"I thought this was a collaboration," remarked the man sitting behind the both of them, twirling a silver chain between his fingers. "That's why we're all in this, isn't it?"

/"We/ are not anything!" hissed Voldemort. "You are me! I am you! There is no /us!"/

"Eurgh," said the first man, "get a load of this guy."

"I know," said the other. "I can't believe we're related."

"We are not related---" Voldemort sputtered.

"He thinks he's our dad or something."

"Shut up!"

"Albania did him no good, you'd think he'd have come out with a tan, at least..."

"Are you even listening to me? Get back to work!"

"To be fair, we never visited the seaside for the sunbathing, either..."

Voldemort scowled. His elaborate plan involved using his Horcruxes to create chaos in the enemy ranks, but now it seemed more and more like a terrible idea.

**** Round Robin crack fics aside, the horcruxes having independent personalities and consciousness is a really interesting idea. Has anyone ever used that concept?

***** A few fics, yeah. There are a fair number of oneshots and longer fics with a "simpler" version of the premise, generally through the Horcrux in Harry's scar and/or the Diary, and occasionally through locket possession (i.e. of a side character like Sirius). Not always enemies, though- Black Comedy and many others have the Diary Horcrux become good and sabotage Voldemort. DPSW also brings up the different Horcrux versions acting independently.

*** Suddenly, Luna pops from the bushes wielding a single leaf, "I don't know why you lot are fighting, but the Wompintompins told me I had to stop it."

**** Meanwhile, the broken trio have their wands tightly gripped in their strongest hand, in case of a sudden attack, pointed at one another. The people around them can feel the atmosphere growing thicker by the second, as Ron glares at Hermione, sending jolts of shivers down her spine. He raises his wand slightly, so that it is in alignment with her facial features. His mouth opens, but before he can say anything, a shout of ‚Äúexpelliarmus‚Äù can be heard and Ron's wand is sent darting out of his hand.

‚ÄúSee Weasley, just because you think that you're better than me, doesn't mean that I can't beat you in a fight!‚Äù Harry snarls, causing Ron to grimace at the use of his last name.

Through all of this, Hermione was stood in awe, her mind raking over the past day and wondering what had happened to their seven years of friendship. But then, as if she was if she was under the imperious curse, her happy,intellectual mind was clouded over with extreme hate for the two boys in front of her and no matter how hard she tried to rid the thoughts of torturing them and killing them, she just couldn't. She slowly raised her wand, and pointed it at Ron, a unforgivable curse on the tip of her tongue when....
