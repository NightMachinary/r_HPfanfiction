The first time we see both of them interact (well, probably, the first time Molly started screaming and could've uncovered the poor guy), they're fighting over what Harry needs to know and what he doesn't, Molly throws an insult at Sirius and he starts to rise from his chair to do God knows what (seriously, what /was/ he going to do in front of her kids? Hex her? Start a screaming match?). Later that exact same day, Molly sees a boggart and Sirius (mostly Remus though) attempts to comfort her. Later that day, they are both acting very civil towards the other.

I just love Molly Weasley, normal witch and mother, is trying to get over the death of her brothers and the first war, then she sees the Azkaban escapee Sirius Black and she gets very scared, and tries to protect the latest addition to her family who is obviously Harry. Two to three years later, she learns of his story and how Harry loves his Godfather, and she should work alongside him in the Order of the Phoenix. It's a bit hard to stomach, to be honest. Even if he was innocent, I still wouldn't be too friendly or cheerful around him, least of all trusting.

If Sirius was cleared, they could've had so much potential for a fascinating dynamic.

If you do have a recommendation, no romance please (Molly/Arthur for the win) or both weeping and hugging each other first thing after the fight. I would also prefer a Sirius that isn't in any active romantic relationship, but it's ok.


** I think the reason Sirius rose from his chair at that point has more to do with the fact that there were thirteen at the table, and Rowling wanted to see if we were paying attention. Then he sits down and Remus gets up, and then Remus sits down and there's a general uproar starting with Fred, presumably getting up.

There were actually thirteen counting Peter in Ron's pocket when Dumbledore got up to draw Trelawney a chair.

** I find Molly so unpalatable in OOTP and the most helpful comment I ever read was essentially: imagine if [Ted Bundy/insert your infamous criminal of choice] was exonerated and now wants to hang out with your daughter. The evidence is there. You *know* it's true. But.../really/?

Sirius isn't framed sympathetically by the text all the time, but it never doubts his innocence. Molly may not have been so sure. I almost get it that way...it was a lot to overcome. But she still went below the belt.

(And I have no doubt he was rising to get in her face. He does the exact same with Snape several chapters later. It's...not a great look.)

I know of one fanfic that shows the aftermath, but it's... angsty, and mostly a vehicle for Wolfstar hurt/comfort. I'll spare you.

*** To be honest, since Hermione was essentially Rowling's mouthpiece in the books sometimes, I felt she was borderline bashing Sirius in the fifth book. For one, he never saw Harry as James. Secondly, he was in need of therapy, whether by seeing an actual therapist or just not being in a place that triggered his PTSD. It was so likely that he was abused at home, both emotionally and maybe even physically. Yet Rowling doesn't address this. I have this feeling she really wanted us to hate him before she killed him off, so we don't miss him. And for me? It almost worked, by the time I reached his death I was so annoyed with him, but did feel a bit sad. Think Abby Griffin from the 100, like the annoying character everyone wants to die but feels sad when they actually do.

On later rereads however I didn't feel this way at all, I was actually sobbing by the time I reached his death. He was so mistreated by everyone around him, except for maybe Remus and Tonks (Molly, Dumbledore, Kreacher, Harry didn't even have the decency to at least open the gift to see what it was, Hermione was always disapproving of him and freaking Snape).

Hermione wanted to start the DA but when she heard Sirius say it was a good idea she was suddenly reluctant to start it. Why exactly? At the first reading I thought Molly's sentence was a sick burn, true but still a bit sick but later on it was just downright inappropriate. Dumbledore admits Sirius was at a bad state of mind. Dude, if he has a bounty on his head, just let him get back to whichever tropical region he came from and yet he stayed for Harry, who didn't even open the mirror AT ALL. Like, ok if you think it's dangerous why not just look at it out of curiousity (Harry was always too nosy for his own good but now he ran out of it. Why....). Ron was the only one who seemed to get the poor guy.

And then Rowling went ahead and made my favourite line of the series by Sirius completely repulsive by his treatment of Kreacher. By the time his life ended, Rowling had basically thrown Sirius under the bus and it was ugly to read. His life is just so sad. Now however, I appreciate him as a complex character and I also love Molly for who she is as a person.

**** Ugh. YES. I agree so much with what you wrote. I would love to run a poll to see his popularity among fans who (i) read the books as they came out; (ii) fans who saw the movie first; (iii) fans who read book first, but without forced pause. I think there would be some significant variation. I read as they were released, and I think part of my undying affection for this character is that we had GoF---where he is at points, frankly, adorable---and a three year period while that seeped in, only to get blindsided by OOTP. It was weird to realize the same godfather who sent a muddy paw print pep talk card to Harry was going to punch Molly Weasley in the face /s.

The only way to reconcile that as a reader, I thought, was the house and this new environment. He was more content eating rats in a cave in his dirty prison clothes. It really said a lot for how he viewed Grimmauld. I think most readers picked up on that and were sympathetic to it, but many didn't and the text sides with them. There was Hermione, the author mouthpiece, calling him “selfish” and implying that he's crazy, and Molly teasing the “fits of the sullens.” The idea of someone who was likely in solitary confinement for over a decade with only the worst moments of his life then left---mostly alone---in a house that gave rise to a lot of those bad memories is unconscionable to me. To turn around and chide him for being unhappy there is distinctly cruel. No wonder he so loved James; he was probably the only person who was ever decent to him! The same James who was prepared to make him Secret Keeper even though it was “obvious” and a terrible plan, almost certain to end with his death or torture. And he feels guilty about not doing that for him! Like...holy shit. What exactly did your mother do to your self-worth?

The unhappy childhood is mainly played for laughs (the knee slapping hilarity of calling your child an “abomination”). Rowling made him the bad guy in the Kreacher arc despite, you know, the fact that Kreacher conspired to /murder/ him, all of which again undermined character traits in GoF. He specifically won over my animal-loving heart because of his treatment of so-called inferiors like Buckbeak, Crookshanks, and Pig. Hell, even those mail-delivering parrots from the tropics. He literally talked to animals. Then in the next book he's slinging Kreacher from the room by the dirty loin cloth. The reason behind the disparate treatment seemed obvious to me, but based on the number of times a week someone posts a ‘Hot Take TM' on [[/r/HarryPotter][r/HarryPotter]] about how he did not live up to his own standards, no one really remembers the other stuff. They remember the house elf.

On the reasons he stayed in the house: he respects Dumbledore, but he does not always listen to him. He does here. I think there are a few reasons. For one, his involvement in the Order would be threatened, and that's the only thing giving him a sense of purpose apart from Harry; I don't see Dumbledore sharing information with him otherwise if he would be a security risk. Pettigrew would have reunited with Voldemort, so his disguise is likely shot to hell, which rules out Hogsmede/England. And he's not going to be willing to leave Harry for some distant location now that Voldemort is back. He stayed from obligation and duty. I think the text again goes for the weakest possible twist on this---he looks like a bratty child under house arrest because he's too immature to be trusted outside.

Finally---and maybe this just says a lot about me---I genuinely do not understand how his defining character trait is recklessness, such that even Rowling herself called him a “loose cannon.” Such that Harry, in a moment that sticks out like a sore thumb in DH, reflects that he will be as reckless a godfather as Sirius was to him. There are two moments where he is undeniably so: breaking into the dorm and going after Pettigrew on Halloween night. (The latter I would say is justified but that's a separate rant for a separate day.) But, going to the train station in disguise? Wanting to meet up with Harry in Hogsmede? The Quidditch match? Supporting the DA (/HERMIONE/)? I think there's a distinction between reckless and unnecessary behavior, and trying to live whatever life someone whose freedom was stripped for /fifteen years/ can make. It's framed as the reason to mistrust this character, but honestly, it's the reason I like him.

***** I feel Sirius could have gone down a major Darker path without James Friendship.

I imagine a younger sirius while a rebel against his parents might still have been brainwashed in the blood purity nonsense but friendship with James and the good influence of James parents he was able to shed that.

James was likely the first true friend Sirius had, someone who did not hang around him because their parents are friends but because he actually enjoyed Sirius company

I imagine the two best days of sirius life from his own perspective was the day he met James and the day when Harry was born.

I honestly think Sirius Hating kreacher is quite reasonable, Kreacher reminded Sirius of home, I imagine Kreacher snitched on sirius to his parents often.

Kreacher is not an animal, Sirius is kind to animals, Kreacher is a living intelligent being who is a living reminder of the worst of the blacks.

Sirius behaviour in ootp makes alot of sense too, all his friends are risking their lives, while sirius is stuck alone in his childhood house with his crazy elf and crazy moms painting for company

****** Kreacher does more than merely remind Sirius of home. He reenacts painful moments from Sirius' life. He repeats Sirius' mother's verbally abusive commentary. He directs ugly, dehumanizing, threatening slurs at Sirius' guests and friends. When Sirius tries to divest the house of dangerous, dark objects, Kreacher follows him around and un-does the work.

But because Kreacher was Sirius' family slave (who he didn't enslave and who he was couldn't free without risking the health/safety of everyone involved), Sirius is 100% the bad guy, an abuser of the helpless, a reckless hypocrite, at fault for his own death, etc.

****** All the truth. I've said before I thought the treatment is justifiable and it's been a highly unpopular stance. But Kreacher is intelligent enough to know he is cruel and does it anyway; he should only get the respect he deserves, and it's little. Calling him a murderer, throwing slurs at the house guests, undermining the cleaning. He's awful, in OOTP.

***** Yes yes yes to everything you said. Azkaban also wasn't just (just? I think what follows is more than enough) a place where you are mentally tortured to insanity. Arthur spent a few moments there and he went back all shaking and wouldn't talk about it at all. Imagine how terrible that alone must've been. Now multiply Arthur by 12 years and I'm baffled Sirius wasn't as mentally unhinged as Bellatrix (although he was undoubtedly a bit crazed at first). Hagrid said that he wished he could just die in his sleep and never wake up again. Add to that the coldness of it, it's isolated location (in the middle of the North Sea), and Sirius being thin enough in his own words that he was able to slip through the bars in his animagus form. His animagus form was big and 'bearlike', so he was a bit bigger than the average dog. He must've been starved or close to death. In his mugshot (?), Harry thought that he was so pale and gaunt, he looked like a vampire. Then he's shocked by the picture of Sirius years and years ago and thinks he's indistinguishable from now. He's later described as a corpse. So are the other Azkaban escapees. So Azkaban is so cruel, they mentally torture their prisoners, starve them and possibly even have goes at them for laughs.

What really gets me though is when Hermione calls him 'Mr. Black' and 'Sirius' and he's so baffled and shocked he jumps. He hasn't been addressed politely in over a decade and was locked up alone with all the unpleasantries of Azkaban. Dementors cannot speak so there must have been at least rounds made by human guards. When Remus hugs him, he doesn't even hug him back. He hasn't been shown any friendly contact for years and years and years. That's so sad, he just needs to be engulfed with a big, warm and comfy hug and, you know, get some therapy while we're at it. Dumbledore failed to deliver him anything of that. The problem is I love Dumbledore bit this is just something I cannot excuse. I often wonder about their relationship way before Azkaban and in school.

It's just all so enfuriating for (Sirius obviously who shouldn't be blamed for anything he's gone through and being angry and upset at being locked up at a place where he likely had memories of played hundreds of times in Azkaban, having Molly ridicule what he's gone through by calling it 'fits of the sullens' as her own. Husband. Has. Gone. Through. It) me. And then Rowling goes and tells us on Pottermore 'Sirius was a big black dog animagus'.

***** I do think Sirius was a classic Gryffindor with flaws and all, so I could see how he's reckless. But I think the only times we do see him as truly and utterly that, he's at a bad state of mind. Look at it this way, in Grimmauld Place and after James's death he was borderline mental. Scratch that after James died he was mental, laughing at a crime scene and then still laughing hysterically as they took him away. He'd lost it then. Poor Sirius.

I just cannot for the life of me make a connection with Grimmauld Sirius and Goblet Sirius. They're different people, so entirely different. I was honestly starting to think in OotP that Sirius of that book was actually informed Pettigrew was killed on a mission or something and all his proof had gone, but he's actually alive and not until later did I realise he was so depressed in his childhood home.

I wholeheartedly believe James was everything Sirius needed (+Remus and Peter, until he betrayed them all I guess), so I don't particularly agree when Sirius has a gf/wife before he goes to Azkaban. As well as a kid? I believe it completely misses the point of his character and his relationship with James. Come to think of it, every fanfiction goes ahead and emphasizes Sirius and Remus, Sirius and Lily, Sirius and Marlene WhoEver, but never actually Sirius and his absolute best friend, James.

So, yeah. I'd have rather he have told her where to shove it and he could have done so on like six different levels. Like wtf, Molly, your sons told you Harry had bars over his windows in CoS and you're going to act like you're Mother Superior. Sit down. He's trying.

I feel like Sirius thinks he owes him a bit of peace, and Ron liked Sirius, so I don't think he'd like to afford having yet another person hate him. The Weasleys were also living with him for the time being, and having the entire family hating him won't do much to his mental health as Harry also spent lots of time around them.

I do wonder what he would've said to Molly if Lupin hadn't told him to sit down. Also, why would he just obediantly listen to Lupin, and not defend himself, I don't think Sirius is the type to back down.

Now this makes me want to do some kind of community analysis because its got me wondering what other aspects readers took a different way than JKR intended. For example when Hermione is nagging and Harry is annoyed with her, are we /supposed/ to agree with her and dislike Harry? If that was her aim she did not convey it well...

That's not very comforting if he meant it that way.And if it hadn't been for his recklessness, there wouldn't have been all those years in prison and all this being locked up in the house he hates. I guess I'm nasty and am risking my life because Sirius's fans will most probably come after me. But I've read too many fanfics where he annoys me so maybe that's why I'm so mean. No matter if Rowling intended us to hate him by the end, she clearly failed, because most people are ready to defend him no matter the criticism.
