:END:
The main point I remember is that it's a Remus and Tonk family kind of fic. I think it takes place after the war and Moody leaves his house to Tonk in his will. They have Teddy and about maybe 2 or 3 children afterwards. Not sure about this detail but one or two of the children are werewolves or at best half-werewolves. Just a nice family fic of time spent together
