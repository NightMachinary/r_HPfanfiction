Well... I have 2 request actually.

1. Is there any litRPG fic where every witch/wizard get their interface? Like a status page they can access where they can see their learning progress.

2. do you have any HP gamer/litRPG fic recommendation?


** What does litRPG mean? I've not heard that before.

*** Think a gamer! fic. Where there is an increase in definable stats, grinding, savescumming, etc.

Litrpg stands for literary Role playing game.

** I only have four Gamer!Harry fics - though I haven't read them in ages, so I can't tell you anything about them specifically. Some do an interface for statistics and attributes and such, some don't. One of them is the best because it has a secret boss Kneazle and that's delightful, but I can't remember which one it was.

  A different kind of Gamer fic. Harry Potter is sent back in time against his will and forced to redo his life for the sake of humanity. The last chapter will always be current stats.

  Harry Potter catches Voldemort's AK to the noggin only to find out that his life is a video game and he forgot to save. So what does he do? Does he return on Hard mode and work for the challenge? Heck No! Harry uses every exploit, grind, or underhanded tactic he can get his hands on. His life may be a video game, but nobody plays Harry Potter. HIATUS
