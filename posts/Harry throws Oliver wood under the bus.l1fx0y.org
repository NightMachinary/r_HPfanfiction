Lookin for a story where Hermione and other women in harrys life get upset over his flying skills in quidditch and he throws oliver wood under the bus by his telling harry to get the snitch or die trying


** It's referenced several times in Hunter by gredandforgerock, but because he tells his new teammates and word spreads until it becomes something of an in-joke. linkffn(10569323)

But I think the one you're looking for is the one where he tells McGonagall after the game, and she threatens to take away Wood's captaincy if he doesn't adjust his perspective. I'm still looking for that one, but strangely enough "die trying" is a common phrase for a series where he had to kill or be killed by the villain.

  Harry is not content to hear how he is "perfectly safe" and turns to the only adult he feels he can trust. Sirius helps him gain his animagus form, its down hill for the bad guys after that. Then one shock after another leads to a new life for Harry and his three 'Uncles". No pairings. For missgsmith51 who picked the animagus form. **Mercedes Raine is a continuation on this story

** I don't know if it's the specific one you're looking for, but this happened briefly in Stargon1's The Cupboard Under the Stairs.

  A mysterious green inked letter banished Harry from his cupboard. But does taking the boy out of the cupboard also mean that you've taken the cupboard out of the boy? A first year fic.
