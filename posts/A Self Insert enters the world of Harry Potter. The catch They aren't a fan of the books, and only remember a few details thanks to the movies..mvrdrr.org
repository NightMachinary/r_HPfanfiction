** I've actually tried this before, but readers are so used to SIs knowing everything that I think they forget. Someone was like “why doesn't she just write a letter to dumbledore” and I'm thinking “cause she doesn't know jack shit.”

  This is the story of Lydia Bones, a perfectly normal and average person that chose to become a Death Eater over dying. ---------Lydia is called to heal Bellatrix Lestrange in the summer. She is unconscious. One arm is only hanging on by the ligaments and her chest is banded with deep scars. It would be so very, very easy to let her die. To bathe her in green light. But Lydia doesn't give a damn about a newborn boy named Neville and the most she cares about Sirius Black is to hate him. Their lives are not worth her own. The Dark Lord watches her work with glittering red eyes.---------Lydia was never a huge Harry Potter fan. She only ever watched the movies with her sister on snowy days, so she didn't realize what world she'd woken up in until her new brother went to Hogwarts when she was four. Before long, she went off to Hogwarts, where she met Sirius Black's brother (who she knows is going to die, even if she doesn't remember how) and Barty Crouch Jr (who she knows is a ‘bad guy', even if she doesn't remember why). Now, she's graduated and Voldemort is knocking at her door and she isn't Dumbledore. She isn't brave or talented enough to tell him no.
