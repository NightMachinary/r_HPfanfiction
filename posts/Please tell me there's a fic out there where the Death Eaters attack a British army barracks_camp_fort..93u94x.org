***** Stealing a comment from [[/u/taure/]]:

#+begin_quote
  Muggle wank has two forms, I think:

  Firstly, the unrealistic engineering of situations to make them favour Muggles, most commonly through nerfing magic.

  An example of this would be ignoring the effectiveness of wizards' concealment and stealth abilities, often by interpreting them narrowly or writing new loopholes into the magic.

  Another example would be though dismissing wizards' pre-existing penetration of the Muggle government. In canon they seem to be aware of everything the Prime Minister is up to and are capable of rearranging his schedule on a whim - including international arrangements.

  Another example would be failing to utilise various magics for mental manipulation, or downgrading their usefulness significantly.

  A further example is ignoring the constraints a Muggle leader would face from his own world, never mind magical interference. Good luck convincing people you're not insane.

  The most common example, however, is just a "general nerf" - making wizards and magic significantly weaker across the board.

  Secondly, Muggle wank is also the fetishisation of Muggle institutions or social norms and the blind acceptance that the wizarding world would be better if they were adopted. This is what I've called in the past HealthAndSafety!Harry. It's an approach to magic that removes all of the romance of the HP world and also ignores the many ways in which magic should alter the way wizards think about things (in particular, the existence of magic capable of healing basically any non-magical injury).

EMP used by Science Vessels in BW and Ghosts in SC2 drains Energy on things like Infestors, so the idea of EMP affects Psionic energy and Psionic Energy and Mana are fairly similar.

******** Would they disillusion themselves though, when going up against muggle military for the first time? Logically it's the obvious thing to do, but why would they hide given the sheer disregard Death Eaters have for muggles? I've always pictured the very first engagement between eath Eaters and the muggle military with them charging in expecting to cut them down like they do the average civilian, only to have a few of them killed or wounded when the soldiers recover. Only then would they start using their heads and start disillusioning themselves. Having a battlefield advantage is only useful when you use it.

Would your first thought be to grab a gun and shoot them? Or would you think that this is some sort of prank? And by the time they realize these people are killing them, it would simply be too late. Also, the DEs can probably form shields that wouldn't allow bullets to go through. And as I said in my previous comment, if the DEs disillusion some themselves, no one would see them coming and be able to attack them. I think you greatly overestimate the power of the military and underestimate the power of magic.

***** You've clearly never served in the military. After several months of indoctrination, and a few years of service in a part of the world where everyone not wearing the same uniform as you can safely be assumed to hate you or simply be an enemy combatant, you tend to develop an "Us against them" mentality. The first time you see a woman detonate an IED and take out five of your friends, you start to lose any hesitation when it comes to firing at assailants.

Now sure, DE's have magic. Which is awesome. But in the books, and the films, people are dodging spells left and right. When it comes to mundane weapons, you don't dodge enemy fire, you take cover. Now, I'm not saying apparition and disullsionment aren't a real advantage, but consider the M249 SAW if you would - Should you choose to go rock and roll without consideration for barrel, you are blasting out 650 rounds per minute of M855/M856 5.56. That's 11 rounds per second. If you've never seen, or worse, been on the receiving end of it, you can't imagine the sort of devastation it delivers.

And that is the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the hardware you might find a single company armed with.

So yeah, magic is awesome and cool, and can do amazing things. But awesome, cool and amazing won't stand up for long against concentrated fire from trained soldiers.

***** Fine you are allowing shields that stop bullets. Are they instant? How much do they last? Can they shield and fire at the same time?

What about grenades? Does the shield cover that??

You are doing the opposite of mugglewanking now.

A single sniper hidden could take them all out without they knowing.

It all depends on the situation. Imagine they attack a barrack. Straight up attacking.

Once the element of surprise is done, well , you do remember how magic dueling is performed in the movies right?

It Is more like fencing. Now try to concentrate in stopping hundreds of bullets coming at you from multiple machine guns.

I mean i am not guaranteeing the muggles victory, but you cant claim an easy win for the death eaters either.

Is dissilusionment covering infrared too? We don't have any information. So you cant claim that they are completely invisible.

Hell death eaters were stopped by teenagers.

Also wizards are woefully unaware of muggle technology.

They would need to stop communication first to avoid backup and or a sniper or whatever.

My point is that it is absolutely not clear who would win.
