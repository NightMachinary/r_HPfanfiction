I've tried search on fanfic.net and ao3 but they weren't that good, when compared to sites like DLP scryer ,so are there any more sites like that???


** I search by google a lot of times. There's a trick to it that can generally help you get a better search on those sites than the internal search bars provide. It's not perfect, but it's another option.

If you search something in google (or most other search engines) that you put in speech marks, it'll search for that exact phrase on any pages you're looking at.

eg. "Harry dances like a drunken monkey" will look for any pages that have that exact phrase on.

If you follow that with the 'site:' command, it'll search a specific site for that specific thing.

eg. "Harry dances like a drunken monkey" site:reddit.com[[/r/HPfanfiction]]

That'll search this subreddit for any instances of that phrase.

If you look on most fanfic site URLs, they generally take a similar format: WebsiteName dot Thing slash Something-that-tells-us-it's-a-story slash Story ID code.

AO3 is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works]]

FFNet is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s]]

So, if you search:

"Honks" Harry Potter fanfiction site:fanfiction.net/s/

It'll look for any stories on FFNet that have the phrase 'Honks' involved.

Might help.

I also look over the Dark Lord Potter Forum for fanfic recs occasionally. Mostly it's recommendations here, and on author pages/by authors in stories I like to read.

** Tbh I get most of my recommendations from this subreddit. I also read what my favourite authors have favourited/bookmarked.

It can help to sort your ao3 search by kudos, but some of my very favourite fics have a shockingly low number of likes/ kudos. They definitely need more love.
