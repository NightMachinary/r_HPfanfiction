:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Alright, I'm looking for a certain Harry gets neglected for his younger brother fic. Here's everything I can remember about it.

-Harry has both a younger brother and a very little sister. He loves the sister but only tolerates the brother's presence.

-Harry's parents ignored him for years. I feel like they might have been magically forced to forget about him, but I'm not certain on that.

-Harry is a quidditch professional even while he's at Hogwarts, and there's a specific scene where Harry comes home after being featured in a newspaper and his family and Molly Weasley give their opinions on his fame.

-Harry is friends with three different girls, all from different houses, who I'm pretty sure were all attracted to him but he wasn't with any of them.

-There's a fucking scene where Harry is revealed to have been trained by goddamn Merlin.

I know, it sounds like goddamn trash, but I need to find this damn fic so I can sleep.

  If Harry's baby brother, Daniel, is the Boy-Who-lived, then what of Harry? What is his role? Is he destined for greater? Or, is he to play a much bigger role in the future? Follow Canon's plot, with much bigger AU's plot as the story progresses.

** You know, this all sounds like trash.... But familiar trash. I'll see if anything comes to me.

Until then, enjoy my singularly unhelpful comment :D

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
