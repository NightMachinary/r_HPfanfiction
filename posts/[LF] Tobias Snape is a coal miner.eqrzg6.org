:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Please help me find this fic! I remember so little. It was Snape-centric, and was one of the few fics where the Snapes had an actual working class identity beyond being poor and abusive, as they are usually portrayed in fanon. I think there may have been a wildcat strike mentioned?

Or any other fics you can recommend that involve historical background that would be relevant to muggle-born students of the Marauder era are appreciated - doesn't have to focus on Snape.

Thank you!


** I have many problems with Strong Blood by CooLibrarian linkffn(7211094), but it is certainly unique in many aspects and the best description of the Evans family and Cokeworth generally.

** If you want to read other fics involving the snapes, i think you should go to snapecase. Some of the best Snape fics are on there. Here's some of my favourites:

[[https://snapecase.livejournal.com/60177.html][Picketing For Peace]], [[https://snapecase.livejournal.com/38145.html][Catching the Wind]], [[https://snapecase.livejournal.com/49932.html][A Whiff of Cordite]] and [[https://snapecase.livejournal.com/52915.html][Maternal Lamentations]].

Do be careful though, they're not very cheery. Then again almost all snape fics are.

*** Yes! These are great recommendations, thank you! And the first fic was not the one I've read before, which is great because it means that there are several fics with Tobias on strike out there.

** Brings to mind linkffn(A Difference in the Family: the Snape Chronicles by Rannaro). It gives a lot of background on Snape, Eileen, Lily, and the issues Severus had growing up the poor son of a witch.

*** Could never finish this one, because it just promises to follow canon to the bitter end, and we already know how canon happened.

**** Good news! It has an alternate ending where Snape survived! And helped hunt down the remaining Death Eaters, reformed the Hogwarts curriculum, married and had several children.

  This story is AU. What would have happened if Voldemort had understood that defeat, not death, conferred mastery of the Elder Wand and did not kill Snape? And what of all the stray Death Eaters that JKR forgot to mention? Like Bella Lestrange's husband?

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

** I try to do that a little it in my own story that focuses on Lily. But it is more of a sleight of life story. The historical background shows up at times.

I always feel like people ignore some things too much from that time and I try to add them because of that in my own stories
