Looking for good fics where Harry travels to multiple dimensions, can be AU's, can be crossovers. I prefer if Harry is straight, but feel free to link a slash anyway if the story is worth it. (I have read the wandering traveler, or whatever its called ^{^{)}}


** Story: Harry Potter, Lone Traveler, God and Wizard [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12168828]] Its a good read and the author has several side fics that tie in nicely. One of my favorites

  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. ‚ÄúIt's a really long story,‚Äù he says finally, almost apologetically, ‚Äúand it's really hard to believe.‚Äù‚ÄúTry me,‚Äù Regulus says, more than a little daringly.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

** Does Harry need to be the main character? I personally love [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/don%E2%80%99t-be-the-tsundere-fate-stay-night-multicross-si.27312/][Don't Be the Tsundere [Fate/stay Night/Multicross SI]]], but Harry's a side character, he ends up as the little brother of the main character after she removes him from the Dursleys.

** Story: Potter's Protector [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7665632]]

First of four in a series with a little over a million words. Starts as a HP/Buffy the Vampire Slayer crossover, goes on to include Xmen, Smallville, and one anime I'm not otherwise familiar with. The author is a big fan of big support networks full of OP people. Features one of the more intense graveyard scenes I've read. Just reread this whole series recently.
