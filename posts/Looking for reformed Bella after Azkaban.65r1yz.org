I am curious if there are fics out there that feature a good or at least gray Bella that is on Harry's side after breaking out of Azkaban. That means that she was either under the influence of mind-altering magic or actually realized that Voldemort is not the good guy. Please, no good Snape, Lucius, Draco or Dumbledore and no canon pairings.

Edit: I am aware of the top 10 stories tagged with Bellatrix Lestrange.

*** I feel all of these "reformed Bella" fics just suck out everything that made her character, leaving only a hollow, OC husk. It's a shame, really.

** linkffn(my gilded life by skysaber) technically has a reformed bellatrix, but it's mostly a small side piece and not a major part of the plot.

***** Its just incredibly funny, because its just so braindead. Like... there is one part where he goes out and in cold blood murders the Dursleys. Just... wouldn't fucking flinch. And he kinda expects the reader to just accept that because [insert reason murder is okay because child abuse or whatever]. Next chapter he goes on to say that he won't drink tea or coffee, as his faith forbids him to make his mind and body impure or some shit, and readers are supposed to nod to this and see his adherence to his faith as something great.

Like... you fucking murdered two adults /and a fucking child of twelve years/. I don't think the Earl Grey you consumed is the big black mark on your entrance to heaven resume.

Just... *WHAT?!?!*

And you know the absolutely best part? The way he starts the whole damn thing.

  Gilderoy Lockhart. The one person in the books who was there at a pivotal moment and could have made a difference but was utterly unable to. Until a dimension traveler took over his position.
