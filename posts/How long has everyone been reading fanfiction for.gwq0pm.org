I know that Harry Potter has existed for a long time with the first book written before I was even born. I have only been reading around since early 2018. I was wondering what differences does everyone see between fanfiction posted 10-15 years ago and how it has progressed? Also, I wouldn't mind some very old hidden gems if anyone had a suggestion.


** I got into it during summer 2005 while waiting for HBP to be released. I started on HP forums like HPANA, just having general HP chat in anticipating of the imminent release of the next book, and from there found fanfic. A great distraction from revising for my exams.

** I started reading fan fiction in mid 99. I remember cause POA was about to come out, and all the hype about it had me curios about the series. I actually couldn't get the first book of the series to read first. So I started with COS, I was several chapters in before I realized Hermione was a girl and not a really old fashioned British name for a boy. (I was in 4th grade at the time) I plowed thru that first book pretty quickly and to this day it is still my favorite of the series. After finally getting the first one I was dismayed to realize the series wouldn't be finished for some time which led me to going online to find out when the next book would be released. I found a plug for someone's fanfic in a chat board, it was in an old geo-cities webring. I don't even remember what the story was about but the sparkly background was so lurid it made the text hard to read. I was hooked after that. ;)

** I started in 2011 but had a break reading HP for a few years in between. It's just so addicting! The one 'old' fic I'd recommend is Darkness Within by Kurinoone. That was a great series.

  The story of "Harry Potter and the HBP", but told from the 3rd person POV of Ginny Weasley. Strictly in-canon. Suitable for anyone whom the "Harry Potter" novels themselves would be suitable for.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

** I actually started writing fanfiction before I even knew that you could read it online (BTVS), then again back in 2009 I didn't have a computer or anything like that. Eventually made an account of ff.net in middle school in 2011, when a friend of mine told me about the cite.

** Man I don't even remember. I know I started with Smallville ff in 2001/2002. And I remember starting to read HP books at that time. I think the HP fanfiction came in 2005/2006? Maybe even 2004. I never realized how long it's been!

** I dabbled in reading a couple fanfics in high school, /very/ infrequently (like once a year or so). I followed a couple Hunger Games fics and web serials during my first couple years in college but came upon Alexandra Quick in the middle of my junior year. During the rest of my undergrad and the following summer I must have made it through 200 or so fics, it was definitely the bulk of my reading and a terrible addiction.

I'm in grad school now and am reading more actual books, I maybe read a new fic one night a month. I still follow AQ, Victoria Potter, Pretense, Imposter Complex and a couple web serials, but that's about the extent of it.

I've dug around the older parts of ffn, and here's the summary: old fics tend to be far more poorly written, far more crazy, and far less put-together. Shipping and slice of life are big in old fics, many of the venerated epic, universal fics that are pretty all-inclusive of genre were written sometime between 2005-2015. Recently we've seen a return in the fandom toward lighter, slice-of-life or comedic fare and well-written romance, especially with AO3 taking a bigger role.

linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent) was released sometime in the early 2000s that's regarded as one of the first /really good/ epic Harry Potter fanfics: you'll see a bit of AU, a bit of romance/drama, a bit of slice-of-life. It's in my top 5 fics and reads really well today. It's incomplete but definitely worth a read.

** I started in 2004 when I was 12. English is not my first language and I started reading in English only a few years ago. I read mostly slash back then (and still do). HP's been my fandom since my childhood and it's the most important fandom for me to this day.

I remember reading [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/344335/chapters/558662][Stars With A Spin]] by /Maxine/ in 2004 or 2005 when it was translated to my language. I remember reading [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/cinnamon/BW.html][Beautiful World]] by /Cinnamon/ (again a translation) and crying my eyes out. Just re-read SWAS and thought it was quite good! Not emotionally ready for re-read of BW yet. Drarry fans probably know those fics (they're classics). I can rec both.
