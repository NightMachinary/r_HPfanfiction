The class were brewing Amortentia, the powerful love potion of choice for those with the capital...

As the fumes of the more potent batches filled the room, the potions initial effects settled in, their hawk eyed Professor out and about to ensure none of the more successful dunderheads got any ideas.

Leaving Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter with dilemma's of their own as they picked up their knives to add their final ingredient, the scents of what they loved most curling up their nostrils to toy with their minds... /"Why does it smell like Potter?!?!?! This is not happening. This is not happening!!!"/ Malfoy's skin clammy as he cut uneven chunks out of the root like ingredient, heavy handed and wide eyed. The blonde occasionally peeking (nigh-terrified) over his shoulder at the object of his consternation.

Harry's gaze was on their teachers back, that piercing stare (the effect, Draco had always thought, dulled by those hideous glasses) distant and wistful. He scowled, his distracted mind allowing him the selfish wish that HE was being viewed that way by the object of his-

Draco cursed, blade nearly slicing off the tip of a finely manicured finger. He turned his focus from the boy and back to his work, cursing his name under his breath and ordering Goyle to mind his damn business when he began making enquiries.

All the while wondering what it was that Potter smelled from his bubbling cauldron, and why he stared at Snape's back with such wanton desire...

▪︎▪︎▪︎

Snape shuddered again, Potter's surface thoughts his to read with a quick glance into those distracted orbs,

/'I could totally do it... even in front of all these witnesses. And besides, it's Snape, who'd */REALLY/* miss him?'/

The boy was a basket case and */DEFINITELY/* Lily's child. The Potions Master only now wondering if antagonising the little sadist for all these years was a good idea?
