Basically what the title says, can fall into one or multiple categories listed above but I would prefer Tomarry slash, otherwise no pairings are better. Can be a crossover, Fem. Harry also okay. Just no lemon stories with no plot and no WBWL.

*Fics I've already Read:*

Again and Again

Time to put your galleons where your mouth is

Shadow of Angmar

Strive

A Necessary Gift

Finding home

Whiskey Time Travel

Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time

*And more that I can't remember.*


** linkffn(Full Circle by tetsurashian) looks like something you'd be interested in. Some of their past lives together are ever-so-slightly crackish in their premise (such as the time they're both shipped off to an all-girls boarding school run by nuns) but their current life together is basically Canon: Take Two, which they immediately send off the rails.

Technically WIP, might or might not be abandoned. Not sure.

  Harry and Tom's souls are tied together. Which is why they're in this endless loop of rebirth. At some point, they stopped caring and just started fucking with people. (slightly crack AU w/ some seriousness) MoD!Harry, kinda soulmates!TMRHP SLASH M/M

** ***1) To Kill You With a Kiss Paimpont Summary: After Dumbledore's death, Harry searches for answers in the Pensieve. But something goes wrong. Trapped inside a memory, Harry finds himself back at Hogwarts in 1945 where he meets an 18 year old Tom Riddle teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/995179/chapters/1968412]]

2) The Intruder Time Travel. A nasty business for Auror Harry Potter. A remedy against boredom for Tom Riddle. When two opposing forces collide, something new is created. HP/TR Oneshot

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10911494/1/The-Intruder]]

3) What He Grows To Be (angsty but lovely) Severus_divides_into_H Summary: Time travel MOD story were Harry raises Tom with all his optimism and care but still has to deal with Tom's dark side and obsessive traits its very nuanced and written with care.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19042240/chapters/45228508]]

4) you belong to me (i belong to you): Bamf Harry Potter who takes no shit from Tom deals with the Mod aspect amazingly! Child_OTKW.\\
[[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Child_OTKW/pseuds/Child_OTKW]]

5) The All Seeing Eye Glass seacaptain Summary: When Harry lands himself in 1942 he officially stops caring. Surrounded by witches and wizards that are blissfully ignorant that there's a time-traveler in their midst, Harry resolves to make his own changes, which results in some interesting and unexpected consequences.(It's an amazing time travel story with beautiful character dynamics)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13377375/chapters/30637173]]

6) Little Prince on B612 by Run_of_the_mill It's simply a story of two people who read and loved the Little Prince and allowed themselves to be influenced by it. It's a Tomarry Time travel story were both Tom and Harry love the little prince and Tom sees Harry as the beautiful rose in the story. Lovely underrated story.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16658447/chapters/39060290]]

7) When a Wizard Wishes Upon a Star by RandomBirdEvent this looks like your typical Harry goes back in time to slytherin but I really enjoyed it because Harry actually seems more canon and in character while still having slytherin traits. He is funny sarcastic and lively rather than morose and dark.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23221393/chapters/55595515]]

8) Gilt in Silver and Gold by Araceil its a funny Tomarry story were Harry goes back in time but is in Hufflepuff Tom underestimates him and harry stick out his tongue and basically gives the middle finger while ruining the young dark lords plans

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23670349/chapters/56822665]]

9) When Harry Met Tom by The_Carnivorous_Muffin its a master of death Time travel Tomarry story Harry is female and usually I don't like gender-bending fem Harry story but her characterization is fantastic, dynamic, and fun.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15676317/chapters/36419703]]

10) Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus by The_Carnivorous_Muffin Again from the same author phenomenal MOD concept with a lot of surrealism and interesting philosophical questions

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675621/chapters/36417831]]

11) History Rewritten by FreezePride its an amazing time travel slow burn Tomarry story were Harry starts off by mentoring Tom in to a better human being and watching the character growth is amazing.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13590255/chapters/31195569]]

12) The Untouchable by TreacleTeacups its an apathetic MOD Harry very interesting characterization. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14371158/chapters/33178122]] 13) Jonquils and Lightning by Lomonaaeren its a BAMF Harry story were Harry travels to a calm dimension to live with the Potter Family except Tom from another dimension also comes and tries to recruit Harry to fight in a war. Basically Tom is infatuated by Harry and Harry just flips him the bird

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14178429/chapters/32682234]]

14) Earning His Notice by Lomonaaeren A series of fics where Harry Potter has traveled back in time to Tom Riddle's youth, and has managed to avoid Tom's notice at Hogwarts by pretending to be an ordinary Muggleborn and then working in an apothecary's shop thereafter...a plan that comes crashing to the ground when one of Tom's Knights attacks the shop where he works.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1174940]]

15) Harry Potter and the mountain of pure diamond By Maximonstre Summary: Many, many years after the defeat of Voldemort, Harry has accepted the truth : he is what can only be described as a god. To relieve his anxiety of eternity, he travels between worlds. One day, he stumbles upon one which is far too similar to his first one for his peace of mind. And in which lives one little Tom Riddle, determined to pierce all the secrets of his new guardian...(MOD, au Harry)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15418380/chapters/35785989]]

16) Heir Apparent MonsieurClavier Summary: When a Voldemort in his thirties encounters a time-travelling, seventeen-year-old Harry Potter, he makes a dangerous---and hilarious---assumption. He assumes that Harry is his son. And his son, of course, deserves the very best. A confused Harry plays along for the sake of self-preservation, but living with his “father” is proving to be intolerable in more ways than one. Hilarious Time travel Voldemort Harry story that gradually turns in to a Harry/Tom Story

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25010857/chapters/60562639]]

17) 1) tell me whether he is dead LullabyKnell Summary: Post-DH AU: Harry suffers a few side-effects of dying but not dying. “Hey, can someone help me with this? The mirror in the bedroom's stopped working for me." “What do you mean ‘the mirror's stopped working'?” Gen/MOD Harry [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9191315/chapters/20857637]]

I hope you find something you like all of these stories except the last one are amazing Tomarry fics And in all of these stories Harry's characterization is written amazing he is strong and kind and well Tom is Tom. If nothing else pleeeeaaaase read To kill you with a kiss by Paimpont its a beautiful time travel story heartwarming and absolutely written in a lovely flowery manner.

** Batsutousai has a 2-parter that deals with Harry as MoD in two different incarnations (one per book), and it's Tomarry. The second book in the series (which they say you can read without reading the first) is among my favorites. The first is a little darker and more violent.

  While Harry had been content with his second chance, that didn't keep him from thinking what he could have done different, how many people could have survived if he hadn't been set on the very specific path he'd walked. Third time is the charm, though, right?

In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

#+begin_quote
  After decades of war, the world is on the brink of destruction, with no hope for survival. The only way to go on is to travel back in time and change everything that's gone wrong, starting with Tom Riddle. That's how Harry Potter found himself in 1941, a time he had hoped never to find himself in again. Why 1941? Death has a pretty messed up sense of humour, that's why.
