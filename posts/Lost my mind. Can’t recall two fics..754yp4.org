Ugh. So I'm back in my HP FanFic grind but I've not been able to find two I remember reading a few years ago.

One Hermione is invited back to Hogwarts to teach after she leaves either after the troll or CoS. It's light and fluffy and I can't find it. This one is complete.

Two and this one is harder. I'm 90% certain Harry and Hermione end up head boy and girl with Harry getting amnesia for part of the fic but I'm not sure it is complete. I have no idea what else was there.

Any ideas?

**** Oh yeah, I remember that one. It's mostly a Canon rehash until around chapter 35 when [[/spoiler][Hermione killed dozen Death Eaters naked]].

  What if Hermione's parents had pulled her out of Hogwarts after she was nearly killed by a basilisk in her second year? How would Harry have managed without her? Years later, she returns and learns about his life in her absence. H/Hr
