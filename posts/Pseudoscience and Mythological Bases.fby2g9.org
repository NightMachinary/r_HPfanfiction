So, it's not a new idea that magic works differently than the rules of reality suggest it ought - even Rowling says that it often runs counter to the laws of physics. So, what if there are mythological and pseudoscientific elements that act as the basis of magic, instead of the natural and scientific laws we might think?

For example, what if magical evolution is Lamarckian, rather than Darwinian. For those who don't know, Lamarck proposed a theory of evolution where developed or acquired qualities gained over one generation can be passed down to the next. Eg. If you lifted weights every day and procreated with large muscle mass, your children would be born with and grow into larger muscle mass. So, if you learn to be good at charms, chances are your kid will be good at charms, etc. Same with curses. If you're cursed with something, you can pass it down through your family.

Or what if the legal structure isn't entirely Common Law, but based on geasa and similar magical obligations from mythology?

Does phrenology work to identify Magical Criminals? Can an Auror identify a criminal based on an after-image in a murder victim's eye?

Essentially, are there any things that modern science would regard as wrong or inaccurate that, through the physics-breaking bullshit that is Rowling's magic system, could be real and true for magical society?


** The most obvious one is alchemy, which raises all sorts of interesting questions.

I think this question is best seen through the lens of the three ways of conceptualising a magic system. More about that [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/fc9asg/the_three_types_of_magic_system/?][here]].

*** Oh definitely. I'll be keeping an eye on that thread too, thanks!

And out of curiousity, what kind of questions do you think it raises? Other than what you mentioned in your thread about magical system conceptualism, I mean. Any practical questions - like about potions being less akin to chemistry and more symbolic, for example?

** I think this is a really cool concept honestly. Also the effect on math, I think arithmancy would definitely be a really cool subject if that were the case.
