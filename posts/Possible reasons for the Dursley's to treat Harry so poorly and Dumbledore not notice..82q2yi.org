Dumbledore is obviously at fault for never checking up on Harry and nothing can excuse that away. I was thinking today on reasons why Dumbledore would think he didn't need to check up. One plot bunny came to mind:

Lily and Petunia actually have a good relationship and are friends. Dumbledore is aware of their good relationship and feels the number 4 would be a good home for Harry. Dumbledore is aware that any home that Harry is placed in will be recorded in the ministry. No matter how secret Dumbledore make the address of Harry's home he knows someone will get a hold of it. The ministry is to corrupt for it to not happen. To protect Harry he places the blood wards around the house. While he lives there Harry can't he harmed or killed by the death eaters. The death eaters having found Harry's home notice the blood wards and realize the consequences of attacking Harry directly. They decide to go with a more round about solution and confund Petunia and Vernon to hate their nephew and abuse him. They can't kill him because of the wards but since they are family the wards give them more leeway in how they treat Harry. The death eaters realize they can't kill Harry so they settle for making his life miserable. Dumbledore never visits believing that Petunia will take care of Harry. Once Harry arrives and Hogwarts Dumbledore realizes something is wrong with Harry's health/stature. He discovers what has been done to Petunia and Vernon but can't reverse it due to the fact that the affects have been in place too long. He must struggle with the decision of whether to send Harry back there each summer knowing he will be abused or abandon the protections of the blood wards. Also what will he tell Harry about his relatives behavior and how it could have been prevented if Dumbledore had just checked in on Harry.

I'd love to hear anyone else's ideas on reasons Dumbledore felt ok with leaving Harry with Petunia. Dumbledore really screwed up by never checking on Harry but in the case of good Dumbledore fics I'd like to believe he had reasons to believe Harry would be ok rather than the lame excuse of "he's with family (that I know nothing about and never bother to check on)".

I'd love to read any fics that have a good Dumbledore that had reasons or did his due diligence.


** Dumbledore's reasons for not checking up on Harry are implied in the book.

#+begin_quote
  “Yet there was a flaw in this wonderful plan of mine,” said Dumbledore. “An obvious flaw that I knew, even then, might be the undoing of it all. And yet, knowing how important it was that my plan should succeed, I told myself that I would not permit this flaw to ruin it. I alone could prevent this, so I alone must be strong.
#+end_quote

In the final chapters of OotP, Dumbledore keeps mentioning a certain /plan/ - a plan that revolves around Harry and has been in the works for a long time, well before he ever sets foot in Hogwarts. What the plan is never directly mentioned (but again, is strongly implied), but its sinister implications are made clear - for the plan to succeed, Dumbledore must absolutely /not/ bring himself to care for Harry. Dumbledore must be cold and unemotional, forging and wielding his weapon with ruthless pragmatism.

There is a part of Dumbledore that genuinely wants Harry to have a happy childhood - perhaps more so because his own plans call for an end to it after he comes to Hogwarts. Handing him over to the Dursleys was necessary for Harry's protection, but his insistent non-interference was an act of.. calculated cowardice, almost. Love has always been Dumbledore's greatest weakness - his love for Gellert had almost been his undoing years back - and Dumbledore knows this well. He also knew well enough that Harry wasn't being treated well (Arabella Figg was aware, and she reported to Dumbledore -- infact, Dumbledore had explicitly ordered Figg to not intervene), but evidently he felt that any interference, even indirect, could lead to unnecessary emotional bonds and jeopardise his great plan. As long as Harry was reasonably healthy, Dumbledore was content.

Note that Dumbledore was trying to keep his distance from Harry right from the very beginning, when he left him on Petunia's doorstep with barely a second glance. And that the first time Dumbledore actually shows up at the Dursleys to take his displeasure out on them is in HBP, after he abandons the last vestiges of his plan (at least in that form) at the end of OotP. Not to mention, the first time the Order actively threatens the Dursleys is at the very end of OotP as well.

**** Implying that there are other interpretations :P

re: the wording 'weapon'. I think this might be our biggest point of contention when it comes to Dumbledore - I think there is enough evidence from (this confession + events of PS + understanding of Dumbledore's MO from later books + "We have protected him because it has been essential to teach him, to raise him, to let him try his strength") to inform us of the gist of Dumbledore's plan. Plus, I think from Harry's words at the end of PS, the authorial intention is obvious, for whatever /that/ is worth.

Considering I'm convinced that Dumbledore is lying to Snape in this scene in order to make Snape /think/ that that was always the plan, and that it takes place in HBP, and that even if he isn't lying in that sentence he might still only be referring to just the past year (rather than the past six or sixteen), I'll need a lot more to be convinced that that says anything about Dumbledore's original plan. Maybe it does, but also maybe it doesn't.

While I think we can understand that his original MO was bad news for Harry, I don't think we can make any more judgements beyond that.

  this confession
#+end_quote

This is the only part that I think we can use, unfortunately. I think his confession implies that Harry took more of an active role than Dumbledore intended for him, or perhaps instead that Harry took on that role sooner than Dumbledore expected.

I don't think it really matters that much, our interpretation works either way. My equation looks more like this: (Voldemort can't kill Harry + Harry can't kill Voldemort + looks like someone else has to kill both + no relevant interference in Harry's life to justify this theory + confession). The only active role I can imagine Harry playing is being a test subject so Dumbledore can try to understand the connection better, which could have changed whatever Dumbledore's original plan was, so I'm not saying that wasn't a potential future, only that I don't think that plan would have been properly realized before it became redundant. (edit: this last point also works with what Harry says at the end of PS, too!)

Snape's words - “I thought...all those years...that we were protecting him for her. For Lily.” I think it is quite clear that it is referring to a long time, at least since PS when Snape started protecting Harry. Also note the words "raise him", which again denotes a longer period than just a year. And yes, Dumbledore is obviously deceiving Snape here, but it makes far more sense for him to refer to his initial plans for Harry than make up yet another Evil Plan of Doom for the sole purpose of deceiving Snape.

(Just to re-establish what I /think/ we're disagreeing on, I think that when Dumbledore says "to let him try his strength" he is referring to the events of PS, where he allowed, if not actively facilitated Harry to go after Voldemort himself.)

#+begin_quote

Not ambiguity, implied characterisation. The ambiguity is in Dumbledore's exact role in the events, which cannot be definitely known. Of course, both means of characterisation appeal to me.

I don't know either. But what I do know is that Dumbledore "Keep an eye on Quirrell, won't you?" is probably another indication of authorial intent.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Interesting. I would go for the extreme here - the active role Dumbledore envisioned for Harry is killing Voldemort directly. Dumbledore believed in the prophecy - not that it was binding on both parties, but rather that if both parties were determined to follow its course, one of them would indeed end up killing the other. Which is probably why the events of PS were a test of Harry's friendships and courage and determination to fight, more than anything else. I'm not sure exactly /how/ Dumbledore thought Harry might achieve this feat, but I imagine Voldemort being unable to touch Harry would have been key. (I also don't think he knew of Harry being a Horcrux at this moment in time, which is another point we differ on).

True, this is a good point. I'm going to re-read the scene and get back with you with this in mind.

Okay back, and my mind isn't changed. Snape is the one to says "after all these years?" first. Dumbledore himself makes no such claim. Failing to clarify a timeline doesn't make me suspicious, and I'm not yet sure if the word "raise" does either, though it's possible if you push your point I might end up agreeing about the word "raise" after all. Though I don't think that Dumbledore would need to come up with another Evil Plan of Doom (love the name though) when he can just use his current Plan of Perceived Doom and just not mention parts of it.

#+begin_quote
  (Just to re-establish what I think we're disagreeing on, I think that when Dumbledore says "to let him try his strength" he is referring to the events of PS, where he allowed, if not actively facilitated Harry to go after Voldemort himself.)
#+end_quote

Just before reading that line, I thought, "wait, what are Psycho and I disgreeing about again? I kind of forget", so thank you for reminding me!

I believe that Dumbledore would refer to the events of PS in the "try his strength" line if he did in fact let him try his strength that year. So really, as it always does, I think it comes down to how much we trust Harry's line.

You know, I think that might be the only thing we really disagree on. How much faith to put into that /one/ line by Harry. Like, maybe it feels like there are a few small things we disagree on here or there, but after we go down the rabbit hole, doesn't it seem to always /always/ end up being about /that line?/ It feels like it anyway.

To clarify my stance, I don't disagree with you. I don't think there is anything wrong with trusting Harry's line. If that same line were in DH, yeah, obviously question it, but it's not, it's in the first book, the really simple one. It makes sense to trust that JKR failed to /show/ us the plot and therefore had to tell us. I accept that as legitimate. But, there is just too much contradiction between that line and the plot that it is /just/ flimsy enough that I'm not willing to put all my weight on that leg. I'm not against authorial intent as much as the other North American beast of burden we now - if JKR were to tweet the plot of the first book then I would jump for joy and accept it immediately. Or I'd like to think I would anyway :)

#+begin_quote
  Interesting. I would go for the extreme here - the active role Dumbledore envisioned for Harry is killing Voldemort directly.
#+end_quote

Actually I can see this too. Or at least, I can see this if Dumbledore does not know for sure how Voldemort is immortal or what Harry's scar is yet. And I recognize there is enough ambiguity that that is a possibility. And like you say here,

#+begin_quote
  (I also don't think he knew of Harry being a Horcrux at this moment in time, which is another point we differ on)
#+end_quote

...we can go down the rabbit hole with this one, but I would bet - perhaps not my hand, but a couple of fingers - that it would bring us right back to that line of Harry's in PS. We should get t-shirts made with that quote on it.

** Dumbledore knew exactly what was happening to Harry. He says as much in OotP. It was simply his judgment that a Harry with the Dursleys was better than a dead Harry, which he believed to be the inevitable result of every other scenario. Given that Dumbledore knows a lot more than the reader about both a) the capabilities of magic and b) the realities of the post-1981 political scene, I'm not sure that the reader has any ability to question this.

And there's plenty of reasons to positively support Dumbledore's decision. He'd just seen one of the most powerful protective Charms, the Fidelius, utterly fail. The Bond of Blood Charm is the only protective Charm we know of that is more powerful than the Fidelius. And days after placing Harry with the Dursleys, the Longbottoms were attacked, demonstrating the continued danger.

In any event, his choice to place Harry with the Dursleys saved Harry's life at least twice that we know of (PS climax, DH resurrection), rescued Harry from the fate of having a piece of Voldemort inside of himself (continued efficacy of the Bond of Blood forced Voldemort to turn himself into a quasi-horcrux for Harry), and ultimately won the war (both revolving around the DH resurrection). So not too shabby a record.

And this completely ignores Dumbledore's neglect in checking up on Harry's well-being /at all/, or else not doing anything about it (in fact, we /know/ the latter it true since Figg apparently told Dumbledore about it). There is no feasible excuse given by you nor in canon for this intentional neglect to an abusive family. The man can teleport, knew where the Dursleys lived and told Harry he knew he was condemning him to "ten dark years".

** The thing is, laying the blame on Dumbledore isn't really realistic, or fair at all. Most people will disagree, but I think he does the best he can.

Think about this. You lead a secret, close knit organisation. These are your people, you care for them and know them personally; are close to them. A young couple is killed, and they have a son with a heavy burden on him. You need to take care of him; do what's best. You won't be thinking, "Oh, I should place this child in an abusive home so I can control him later." What you're doing is placing him with his remaining family.

Everyone loves to point out that it isn't up to him where Harry should go; or that if he takes that responsibility, he should keep checking, as if he actually is all knowing, and would have known he'd have an abusive home. At that time, it would have been chaotic, and someone else's decision would have been bad for Harry. It is logical to place him with his relatives.

He isn't the evil, manipulative old man every fic tries to show him as. I'm damn tired of it; laying all the fault on Dumbledore.

*** That's nonsense. It would take all of 10 minutes to check up on Harry every so often, make sure he's generally OK, etc. He can Apparate, and even from within school grounds using Fawkes. Justifying negligence by saying things were chaotic is a non sequitur, there was no impediment.

My belief isn't that he's evil or whatever, but that he didn't do even the bare minimum to make sure an orphaned kid wasn't being put through the ringer by a family he (Albus) didn't know. Much Dumbeldore bashing goes overboard with things like "He was stealing Potter money all along", but the abuse stuff is at his feet no matter what anyone tries to provide as an excuse.

I was just making a casual reference to the fact that the bond of blood does not block out all potential threats, given Dobby apparated right into the house without trouble. The Dementors are irrelevant, they attacked outside the borders of where the bond of blood protects Harry (there were nearer Figg's house), which is why I only brought up the Dobby case.

I agree and if I had not made that clear, then my ability to communicate is clearly bad. I have never thought, nor do I ever recall saying, that /nobody/ could find Harry. I think only that /Voldemort/ could not find him (and maybe that extends to his Death Eaters too, but with that I'm less certain). I do not think Dobby, Umbridge's Dementors, Fudge, any of the Weasleys, or Dedalus Diggle are marked by these same limitations. I'm not really sure why they've been brought up in this conversation, actually. As far as I can tell, we have both made it quite clear they are irrelevant to Voldemort's ability to find Harry.

#+end_quote

Your blatant rudeness aside, I continue to respond because I am interested in your opinion and am trying to understand it. My method for trying to do this is to state what I think you mean in hopes that you will clarify. If you are /not/ saying that the magic isn't as powerful as Dumbledore and Voldemort claim it is, then are you saying it was effective in protecting Harry against Voldemort?

Or are you saying that the Fidelius Charm was a better option? And if this is what you're saying, why do you think so? (of course, maybe my illiteracy is getting in the way and you never said that ;D ). Perhaps you see the Fidelius Charm differently than I do. I see the Fidelius Charm as limiting a person to their house and yard, meaning that Harry would require new protections in his school and while he wandered the neighborhood, etc. The protections Dumbledore gave him seem different to me . Weeks after Voldemort's return to power, Harry visits the local playground. I do not believe that Harry would have this freedom if he were protected by a Fidelius. If you think that the Fidelius would offer Harry the same freedom as Dumbledore's protections, then your point makes much more sense to me. For this reason, I'm curious what you think about the Fidelius charm, and how it compares to Dumbledore's protections, and if you think Dumbledore's protections were not as good.

I am /asking/ because I would like to know, and I will happily wade through your rudeness if that is what that means.

OK, it seems like I keep having to reference what you previously said to explain my responses. You said that what Dumbledore did was the "best/only way to do it [protect Harry]". My response was that it's not even clear how true this is seeing as we aren't even provided the suggestion that he was targeted, so it's not like other options weren't available (Fidelius being the best alternative). After a number of years of no (stated) attacks, he ought to have /at least/ checked in, which we know he didn't bother to do.

This doesn't make any sense, Voldemort knew where Harry was. In GoF, he specifically notes that he understands just how powerful the enchantments on the Dursely house is. And it's a bit much that the Weasley twins and Ron and Dobby know where Harry is (seemingly effortlessly) but Voldemort is just clueless on the matter. In fact, that's extremely unlikely, to the point of hilarity.

Yes it was effective. In GoF Voldemort says he could not touch Harry while he was at Privet Drive, and DH confirms that he still could not do so since he had to hide and wait for Harry to leave the place.

#+end_quote

Yes it was a better option seeing as it would allow Harry to be placed elsewhere with at least a decent family while still being just as untouchable at home. The bind of blood doesn't protect outside Privet Drive either, so it's no better in range (Lily's sacrifice is his sole Voldemort defense outside Prive Drive either way). Heck, Harry was still attacked just roaming his suburb even with the bond of blood, so even canon shows the limitations on range would be no superior than Fidelius.

And it's not unprecedented. It was Dumbledore's suggestion to the Potters. The Fidelius didn't fail to protect, they bungled the Fidelius (no fault of their own) by switching to a spy in their midst. Dumbledore could have just gone with his original suggestion. Have someone (say McGonagall) cast the Fidelius on some dwelling Dumbledore owns and make Dumbledore the Secret Keeper. Unless Dumbledore can;t trust himself to keep the secret, which would be ridiculous.

#+begin_quote
  If you think that the Fidelius would offer Harry the same freedom as Dumbledore's protections, then your point makes much more sense to me.

#+end_quote

All magical protections are hilarious to some degree. Muggles seeing (if I remember right) a dilapidated house instead of Hogwarts, and that sort of thing. Dumbledore describes the protections in Order of the Phoenix in a way where it seems clear to me that Voldemort cannot locate Harry. If you find that unlikely, then I'm not sure what to say. I feel that Dumbledore describes it that way, and I'm not sure there is anything more to say than that.

How the Fidelius and Dumbledore's protections work are both undefined. The Fidelius even changes rules throughout the book. To some extent, we can't argue that either is better, because how in the world can either of us possibly know? These spells don't actually exist. But I do think the books imply that as long as Harry goes to bed in the same place as Petunia (regardless of the building) then Harry cannot be found by Voldemort. While he is at school, or staying in Diagon Alley, then he is no longer at home, and therefore not subject to Dumbledore's protections.

But I don't necessarily think it's wrong to see it differently. What I have a harder time understanding is the idea that Harry would have freedom under the Fidelius Charm. The one thing that seems most defined by that charm is that you are tied to the house, specifically. Harry would not be able to go very far. Perhaps that would have still given him a better childhood, that's true, but those are still difficult perameters with which to raise a child.

But perhaps the main reason I think the Fidelius Charm isn't as good is simply because Dumbledore didn't pick it. We can compare the ups and downs of either protection, but narratively-speaking, that choice only matters for how it fits into the this fictional narrative. That is to say, if Dumbledore intentionally chose the inferior protection, then that says something about his character, the plot, and the themes. From a literary perpective, a lot weighs on which protection was better, and why Dumbledore chose the one he did.

If the books give me a good reason to think Dumbledore would want Harry to be less protected, then I will work backward from that and decide that that he must have then chosen the weaker protection. Part of me wishes we didn't have to do that, but these are books after all, and that is what we have to go on.

I have heard a few theories that Dumbledore /did/ want a weaker protection, but I haven't found any of them convincing yet, so I continue to think that Dumbledore would naturally choose the best protection. Meaning, that protection he chose is the best. I don't lay this out becuase I think you need to agree with me, I lay this out because I want to make sure every theory I have is internally consistent within the wider story in a literary sense. And of course there are many many many flaws and inconsistencies that allow for different interpretations, and that's okay, it's a book and that's to be expected. The reason I said it was good to know the way my theory doesn't work is because I'm interested in that sort of thing. All theories, even decent one, have holes in them in you dig deep enough.

In another conversation in this thread I talked with a person about Dumbledore and Snape's converation in Snape's memories and throughout the conversation we realized that, at it's core, what we really disagreed on was just a passing comment of Harry's in the first book. I recognize that if I thought differently about that /one/ sentence, the domino effect of would have led me to agree with this person about the conversation between Dumbledore and Snape six books later. I definitely think all these things are inter-connected because everything exists to tell a story. What story does Dumbledore's protection choice tell?

But I do admit I was still being snarkier than was called for, and I'm sorry about that.

As I followed up, Voldemort implies in GoF he knew where the Dursley house was already (otherwise how did he know the enchantment in place there?), and obviously he's hiding near Privet Drive in DH.

#+end_quote

I don't really get this. The bond of blood only protects him at a dwelling as well, hence the unimpeded Dememtor attack just a few streets away. People can leave the domain protected by the Fidelius without terminating the charm, and it's not like the Dursleys moved around at all anyway (besides, the Fidelius could be recast if necessary).

In reality, the issue is JKR didn't work all these details out in advance (beyond a general outline). I mean, the obvious solution to the initial Voldemort problem would be to have James cast the Fidelius Charm and make Lily the secret keeper, making them perfectly protected. But I'm fine having a headcanon that makes such a use disallowed by the charm.

My issue is there's just no way to do this with Dumbledore leaving Harry at the Dursleys, the circle just can't be squared. He straight up says he knows what was going to happen when he left him there, so we know he wasn't ignorant of the consequences beforehand and while it was happening. McGonagall herself said there were scores of families who would willingly take him in despite the dangers given how unsuitable she saw the Dursleys to be /within one day/. Dumbledore already knew (and suggested using) the Fidelous with Dumbledore as secret keeper to ensure absolute protection (Voldemort fears Dumbledore), so safety was achievable.

Now look, I don't think Dumbledore was malicious. I think this just points out a flaw in how the story logic holds together, JKR just messed up. The setup of the series only works if Dumbledore believed that the Dursleys - being Harry's remaining close relatives (ignoring the pureblood families) - would take him in and treat him at least decently. But since Dumbledore in books 5 & 6 made clear he knew that wasn't going to happen, and knew it wasn't happening, it makes the decision to leave him there under the excuse of "He's safe there because blood protection" impossible for me to swallow. There were other options that Dumbledore himself used in situations that were even more dire (Lily and James hiding under Fidelius) that would work without the Durselys.

Like I expect fictional stories about magic to be a bit kooky, but for the life of me this bit can't hang together in a way where Dumbledore's reason for doing it makes sense to me. But hey, that's just me.

Sorry, by undefined, I didn't mean geographically, but that the world-building is limited in what it tells us about how magic works and what its limitations are. Maybe a better word to describe what I meant is the rules of magic are too vague. Your point stands regardless, though.

#+begin_quote
  The bond of blood only protects him at a dwelling as well
#+end_quote

I think this is where we differ and why we found each other's stances so confusing. I don't think it /does/ protect him only while within certain geographic parameters. I think it is a more abstract protection than that; that he is protected by the /thought/ that he is home. But it's dependent on Petunias thought that he is home also. So long as the two of them acknowledge that this is his home, and that he is at it, then he is protected. Of course then, what is "home"? Right? When I go to my hometown I say "I'm home", even if I'm at the grocery store, you know? If this all sounds silly, I understand, but I do genuinely feel this is what the books suggest. And like I said above, this is vague enough that it allows for multiple interpretations, but I feel that Harry's ability to walk around Little Whinging mere weeks after Voldemort's return tells us that Harry is protected there (I think we've both said the Dementors are irrelevant because they are from Umbridge, not Voldemort). And how Moody really emphasized the importance of Petunia and Harry deciding that they are not returning "home" at the same moment was paramount to their escape from Privet Dr. It is what their protection hinges on, and for the same reason, it was also what their escape hinges on. I feel the nature of their escape depends on the abstractness of the "home" concept.

I don't think the idea of magic being dependent on thought or intent is far-fetched in this world either. There are other instances where this is the case, like how Lily's protection was only able to be formed because of Lily's intent and the changing intentions of Voldemort that night. Also, things like Bellatrix saying you have to really mean it to do a Cruciatus Curse.

I don't think the Fidelius Charm is a bad option. But I'm not totally sure that it is a /better/ one. But I totally agree, JKR didn't really work out the details and so we're left with these sort of confusing examples of magic and trying to make sense of them.

#+begin_quote
  He straight up says he knows what was going to happen when he left him there, so we know he wasn't ignorant of the consequences beforehand and while it was happening.
#+end_quote

And this is why I think Dumbledore /was/ aware, but intentionally ignored it, or pretended it wasn't an issue. I don't say this to defend Dumbledore or to justify his actions. I think this because it fits into my larger interpretation of the man and how he fits in and progresses the plot. He was terrified of seeing Harry as a human being, because if he did, how could he have the strength to someday sacrifice Harry in order to defeat Voldemort? We, as readers, have the benefit of hindsight to see there were other solutions, to see that Dumbledore had time, but Dumbledore doesn't, and he made the wrong choice. He knew that it wouldn't be a happy one, but for all he knew Voldemort could return in a month or three years. Dumbledore also made this decision within hours of the Potters death who were supposedly protected by the Fidelius Charm. I think it's understandable that he might be suspicious of all Secret Keepers and prefer not to entrust Harry's life on any single person. (I don't think JKR had thought up the idea that a Secret Keeper dying makes everyone else a Secret Keeper who knew the secret, but that could retroactively explain why he didn't entrust the secret with himself either).

I'm not so sure any choice he made would have been the right one either. I think the way he justified this choice was that Harry would definitely live, and everything else can be worried about later. With the Fidelius Charm, Dumbledore has to worry all the time, if he has to cast the spell again for any reason, that means he has to constantly survey the situation to see if it's necessary to do so. If my interpretation of Dumbledore is correct, I don't think he would want to do that, I think it makes sense that the other method was easier for him. Not the right choice, but the easier one.

If it isn't clear, the crux of my interpretation of Dumbledore is that he fails at his own advice more often than not. I don't think he intentionally fails, just that he always realizes way too late that he buggered things up.

*** Ear ear!

I'm damn tired of it too. I've kind of taken on a personal mission to understand /why/ so many fans blame Dumbledore for everything. I think it follows a similar transition that people take from kid to adult in how most of us view our parents. As kids, we trust them and know they can solve any problem ever. As teenagers, we notice they aren't solving everything, but we still feel as though they /should/ be able to because we haven't completely humanized them yet. When our parents inevitably fail at this, we blame them for it, get angry, perhaps we feel unloved, because if they loved us, they would have naturally solved the problems perfectly. Only as adults do we finally understand the unrealistic expectations we placed on them, and understand that they did the best they could, and that nobody, even parents, can succeed 100%. I've heard a lot of accounts where people "realize" he's a liar and manipulator and other accounts where people "realize" he's not, and that he loved Harry and did the best he could with the shitty situation he had. If anything, I think this means Dumbledore is very well written, because we get something so different out of him based on our own age.

The other reason is reading fanfiction. I fully support reading any and all types of fanfiction that anyone wants to read, but I do notice that people tend to forget it's not canon.

Figg told Dumbledore that things were off, but he didn't change anything. Dumbledore never once checked up on Harry, nor did anything to compel the Durselys to treat him at least with a modicum of decency.

He's to blame because he orchestrated the whole thing, knew what was going on, did nothing to fix the situation, had the power to do routine checks on Harry (Apparition) and allowed it to persist (in his own words) because it was part of his plan.

***** These are good points, and I suppose I should say that I also hold Dumbledore responsible, I just do it a different way than others in this thread.

He has the ability to check up on Harry, but in order to do so requires him to be attentive and caring, to devote time and thought-space to Harry. I don't think he did that. I think he was scared of thinking too much about Harry, and intentionally and cowardly pushed Harry from his mind. He was scared of falling into the trap he foresaw if he got too close to Harry. He does eventually fall into that trap (and perhaps arguably it is a good trap to be in), but he hasn't fallen yet. I blame him for his own cowardice and neglect, but as a fictional character, where no actual people are harmed, I appreciate the depth this gives his character.

I think it is that cowardice that he is ashamed of and that is what justifies him blaming himself. I don't think Dumbledore needs to have had sole responsibility over Harry for him to feel the weight of his own personal failure.

I suppose what I'm arguing against is blaming Dumbledore in a way that doesn't acknowledge how this fits into Dumbledore's character and the broader story.

Additionally, I hold the Ministry responsible, and the Muggle schools, and Mrs. Figg. Perhaps mostly Harry's teachers and Mrs. Figg since they are the ones that saw him the most. The Muggle system failed Harry just as well as the Magical one did.

** All this angsty blame-happy bashing ...

- Dursleys are his relatives and likely the only legal guardians. If matter was left to the authorities and those authorities acted based on law and tradition then Harry would have most likely ended up with Dursleys anyway.
- Dursleys had to provide home for Harry /willingly/ and /without coercion/. It is very likely that early on if someone came to discipline Dursleys they would have kicked Harry out. Petunia had to take Harry in on her own and be willing to keep him in her home.
- If Ministry had any say Harry would have ended up with someone like Malfoys and then met an /accident/ very very quickly. If he ended up with any family opposing Voldemort he and his carers would have been in mortal peril. Just think what happened to Longbottoms just because of a rumour that they might know where the dark lord is?
- Despite Harry's life at Dursleys he does grow up /healthy/, /strong minded/ and does not show any overt signs of abuse or neglect. In fact in canon he is remarkably well adjusted boy considering his circumstances. Which leads me to believe while Dursleys were awful in general they were more bark than bite.
- Dumbledore (thankfully) chooses healthy and alive Harry over potentially dead or smitten by fame Harry. Imagine a mini Gilderoy ...
- Despite what some claim I don't think Dumbledore knew exact details of Harry's life. I doubt he knew about the cupboard for instance. As far as he knew Lily had been a wonderful person and I imagine he thought her sister wouldn't be that different. Later when he did realise it was too late to change. Considering darkening times, Voldemort's reappearance, etc.

In the end Dumbldore had to make tough choices in a horrible situation. Voldemort's fanatic followers were at large, Harry's safety was paramount, putting him anywhere was to put his carers in danger. So he chose Dursleys and utilised the best protection he could provide for Harry. In the end he chooses healthy, alive and reasonably well adjusted Harry (if somewhat mistreated and unhappy) over dead Harry.

Dumbledore isn't perfect, he does make mistakes, he is machiavellian character. No point in denying that. However in the end it is thanks to Dumbledore that Harry does survive, Voldemort falls and Harry is finally free to live his own life and have a future. Without Dumbledore Harry would have died long ago. And in the end Harry chooses to stand by him and fight Voldemort rather than run away and hide.

*** - Legal guardians don't have carte blanche to abuse their charges. They lose custody if found out.

- So basically your point is if anyone made clear to the Durselys that /abusing a kid/ wasn't OK, they would kick Harry out, so it was OK to let a kid languish there despite there being dozens of upstanding families who would take him in? Wow.

- Considering Dumbledore made the decision all on his own, there's nothing that stopped him from picking someone else, or hell, raising Harry himself at Hogwarts, the supposed safest place in the UK (or simply checking up on Harry's well-being every so often, he can teleport for crying out loud).

- He didn't grow up healthy, his weight problems were a running gag(?) for most of the series. That said, JKR's portrayal of this was rather unrealistic (and no, pointing out that the series is about magic doesn't mean it's ok for everything to be nonsensical). Locking a kid in a cupboard, bullying him (from adults no less), beating him (or letting Dudley beat him up) is not "more bark than bite".

- "Hey my scheme left you alive and there was no other way to do that besides making you a prisoner in the home of your so-called family. Ain't it a great plan?" You can't really think that was the only option.

- He did know about the cupboard. That was literally on his Hogwarts mail. Dumbledore told Harry, to his face, that he knew he was sentencing him to (in his own words) "ten dark years". And this comes back to a prior point: Dumbledore can /teleport/, it would be trivial to make sure the orphan he dumped on a family (whose character he didn't know) was doing OK.

Tough choices, and his answer was about the worst option that didn't involve Harry dying. In this case, he says he chose this path because he (Dumbledore) didn't want to become too emotionally attached to Harry.

**** Your points are both valid and utterly missing the point at the same time. Yes you are correct of course that Dursley's should loose the custody for their treatment of Harry, but who should raise him then? The whole dilemma with Harry is choosing between lesser evil - alive Harry and mistreated or potentially dead or tortured to insanity?

I never understand why people insist that Dumbledore has to personally care for Harry. He has many other duties and is probably very busy dealing with aftermath of Voldemort's downfall and keeping Hogwarts safe. He provided Harry with best protection he could and left him with his family that was legally bound to take him in anyway. It's just tough luck that Dursleys turned out the way they did. Should Dumbledore now be considered responsible for every other child being mistreated too?

Of course we can argue that Dumbledore should have checked up on him, but at the same time I have to ask why should he? He has no personal connection with Harry - he is just a child he delivered to his rightful family.

If anything abuse should have been noticed by other people more immediate to Harry - his school teachers for instance. Perhaps even neighbours. Nobody did. Dursleys were pretty good at keeping their neglect out of sight.

As for Hogwarts letters I am pretty sure they are entirely automated. I very much doubt someone would have written hundreds of copies that were delivered to Harry or would know his room had changed after the first letter.

And yes I strongly assert that Harry only survived because Dumbledore protected him. Could Dumbledore had done more? Absolutely! At the same time he could have left Harry to his own fate and either he would be dead or permanent resident at St. Mungos.

***** This is just the false dichotomy I mentioned before. The options weren't "Harry gets abuse or Harry dies". Was Dumbledore not able to watch him, either as his guardian (seeing as he made the decision where to place him) nor able to do routine checkups?

Um, maybe because he made the decision on where to place Harry, later stating that he knew the dark environment he would be brought up in. The concept here is known as responsibility. He gave Harry the best protections he could to outside threats (at least, from Voldemort and the DEs, seeing as Dobby had no issue getting in). It's not "tough luck", it was willful acceptance on Dumbledore's part. Again, Dumbledore himself says he knew this from he start, and the reason why he's relevant here is because /he put Harry there/, but he did not put other kids in abusive homes.

Why should he? Because he is, presumably, not a psychopath who thinks doing the right thing is just a luxury. And the fact that he knew what would happen if he did it.

Out of sight of Muggles in the 80s, sure. But Dumbledore knew the situation, knew that he lived in a cupboard and was even told by Figg that something had gone wrong, yet told Figg not to interfere.

Since the letters are delivered by owl, someone is attaching the letters to the birds. And again, Dumbledore said he was aware of the situation so pleading his ignorance is rather silly.

Um, no. We are never told that there were any attempts on Harry at Privet Drive until well after he entered Hogwarts, so it's unclear just who the bond of blood stopped until Voldemort's resurrection. It's not that Dumbledore could have done more, it's that he literally did the bare minimum to keep Harry protected from certain threats, meaning he did the best alternative... among the worst options he could pick where Harry survives.

That's one of the reasons I can somewhat empathize with fics that take the piss out of Dumbledore on this point (and some of the manipulative stuff later; the "greedy Dumbledore" trope is a bit much though). I had a friend who grew up in an abusive home and it fucked him up pretty badly for a long time, so I guess this plot point always annoyed me. Like, he can /teleport/ and check in himself.

He even straight up admitted that he knew of the abuse and that he sentenced Harry to "ten dark years", and yet Harry acts like the sun is shining out of his arse. I am quite sure that locking a child in a bloody cupboard qualifies as torture and yet Dumbledore is seen as a good guy by a large part of the fandom despite being the ultimate reason Harry had to live through that.

Greedy Dumbledore is just stupid. I mean, why steal from Harry and not just use your awesome magical power, which fucked up magical Hitler, to actually rob your enemies?

*** This is why the fanon concept of wards is so harmful. Not because the word does not appear in canon, but because it leads to be people importing all sorts of ideas that are attached to the idea of "wards" - such as the idea that "wards" are tied to a location by their nature.

There are no "blood wards" on Privet Drive.

The protective magic which Dumbledore cast, fuelled by Lily's sacrifice, is the Bond of Blood Charm. It is on Harry (or rather, in his blood), not Privet Drive. There is absolutely nothing special about Privet Drive other than the fact that Petunia happens to live there, and her presence strengthens the Charm.

If Harry had been raised with any other guardians, if he had somehow managed to survive until his Hogwarts years, he would have died against Voldemort at the end of PS. Without Petunia's presence, the Charm would have broken long, long ago, (in fact it would never have sealed in the first place) and Harry would have had no defence against Voldemort.

If Voldemort hadn't utilised such an ingenious resurrection method, which incorporated Harry's blood into himself, then he would never have been able to touch Harry, resurrection or no. Harry would have remained an anti-Voldemort and have been perfectly safe.

As it is, Voldemort was forced to go to great lengths to bypass the power of the Charm, lengths which in the end were his undoing, as taking Harry's blood was a huge mistake, turning himself into a quasi-horcrux for Harry. That is to say, Harry having been brought up by the Dursleys saved his life on more than one occassion and ultimately won the war.

**** No, the bond of blood functions only at Privet Drive, he's protected while he's there and considers it to be his home (that's why the Death Eaters & Voldy waited outside the enchanted space in DH). The charm is specifically said to protect Harry while he's at Number 4. Lily's sacrificial protection... protects him generally, but the bond of blood is a protective enchantment when Harry is at the dwelling that Dumbledore cast:

"/While you can still call home the place where your mother's blood dwells, there you cannot be touched or harmed by Voldemort. He shed her blood, but it lives on in you and her sister. Her blood became your refuge. You need return there only once a year, but as long as you can still call it home, (note this-->) there he cannot hurt you. Your aunt knows this.

  You would be protected by an ancient magic of which he knows, which he despises, and which he has always, therefore, underestimated - to his cost.

I put my trust, therefore, in your mother's blood. I delivered you to her sister, her only remaining relative.*”

  “She doesn't love me,” said Harry at once. “She doesn't give a damn -”

  “But she took you,” Dumbledore cut across him. “She may have taken you grudgingly, furiously, unwillingly, bitterly, yet still she took you, and in doing so, *she sealed the charm I placed upon you. Your mother's sacrifice made the bond of blood the strongest shield I could give you*.”

  “I still don't.”

  “While you can still call home the place where your mother's blood dwells, there you cannot be touched or harmed by Voldemort. He shed her blood, but it lives on in you and her sister.

The sacrificial protection and the bond of blood Charm are not separate. The Bond of Blood "seals" in the effect of Lily's sacrifice, turning it into a shield - the two are intrinsically linked.

There is no "only" to Dumbledore's statement about Harry's safety at Privet Drive. He's safe there, yes, just as he is safe outside of Privet Drive (which we saw at the end of PS).

You are also ignoring the rest of the explanation, which supports my point:

#+begin_quote
  My answer is that my priority was to keep you alive. You were in more danger than perhaps anyone but I realized. Voldemort had been vanquished hours before, but his supporters - and many of them are almost as terrible as he - were still at large, angry, desperate and violent. And I had to make my decision, too, with regard to the years ahead. Did I believe that Voldemort was gone for ever? No. I knew not whether it would be ten, twenty or fifty years before he returned, but I was sure he would do so, and I was sure, too, knowing him as I have done, that he would not rest until he killed you.

  “I knew that Voldemort's knowledge of magic is perhaps more extensive than any wizard alive. I knew that even my most complex and powerful protective spells and charms were unlikely to be invincible if he ever returned to full power

They are separate, but related. The bond of blood was placed by Dumbledore. Lily's sacrificial protection was obviously already in place, that's how the Killing Curse was deflected off of Harry. Dumbledore said that Lily's sacrifice is what let him cast the bond of blood in the first place, not that the two are one and the same, they are related (you need the sacrifice for the bond to be cast later). That's why Voldemort needed Harry's blood in the first place. It let him breach Lily's sacrifice (i.e. Harry's general defense against Voldemort), but it did not let him breach the bond of blood (he said so himself, not to mention DH proves this is the case what with him hiding nearby), ergo the two are not the same thing. The bond of blood protects him while he's there, as Voldemort states in GoF ("I cannot touch him there").

  You are also ignoring the rest of the explanation, which supports my point:

I didn't ignore it, but I already made my points in regards to this in several other comments on this thread and repeating myself again wasn't appealing. In short, Dumbledore chose to put Harry there despite knowing (as he admits) that he was leaving him to a dark fate for ten years. Hell, if he had just done routine checkups that could have solved the whole issue. Or if we're going to insist that wasn't an option (because I guess Apparition is out of the picture for some reason), we /know/ Fidelius can keep Voldemort out. The Fidelius didn't fail James and Lily, they failed to pick a good secret Keeper. The obvious solution is to make Dumbledore the secret keeper and make, I dunno, McGonagall the one to cast the charm. (This was Dumbledore's suggestion for James & Lily so of course it would have worked)

**** Thank you for saying this. Voldemort literally could not kill or even touch Harry.

A bit of a tangent, but I feel it is often overlooked just how much the prophecy contradicted reality before Voldemort's return to power. Voldemort /could not/ kill or touch Harry, and Harry could not kill Voldemort because Harry himself was keeping Voldemort alive.

What a confusing reality Dumbledore was faced with! The prophecy says one will kill the other, and yet /both/ are equally impossible!

*** I always thought the blood wards were a load of crap anyways. The books don't really explain how they work. Do they only protect Harry when he's at home? Do they still protect him while he's at school? Do they interact with the sacrifice Lily made to give them greater range? Its really a big plot hole that can be interpreted however the author of a fic wants too. I read one fic in which Dumbledore never created any wards. He just told everyone he did and that no one could harm Harry while he lived there. Everyone believed Dumbledore and didn't even try. I thought that idea was quite funny.
