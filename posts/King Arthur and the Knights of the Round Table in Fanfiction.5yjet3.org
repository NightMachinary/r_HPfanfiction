Merlin is mentioned in every chapter of every fanfiction. It's cannon that Merlin existed in some form or fashion. But we never hear about Arthur or his knights! Are there and fics that involve the history of King Arthur? I think it would be so cool to have a secret modern Round Table. Like an underground Wizengamot.


** Am I allowed to recommend books in this sub? Cause what you're looking for sounds exactly like one of my favorite book series.

**** There's a book series called Alfred Kropp. I remember reading it way back in middle school. It's basically about a modern day knights of the round table protecting Excalibur.

** This is only tangentially related to King Arthur, as it's a crossover with the television series Merlin. It's really good though, IMO, :D

  When Albion calls Merlin, he returns to puzzle out why. Meanwhile, two years of peace are shattered when Harry Potter is attacked and left badly beaten, the Elder Wand stolen from his grasp. Then a sword appears in front of Buckingham Palace and a dragon escapes from Wales. As the Ministry of Magic and the Order of the Phoenix scramble for answers, Merlin gathers his allies (both old, new and unexpected) as he prepares to greet Albion's Darkest Hour. Morgana declares war in a single, devastating blow that leaves England's wizards stunned beyond words, making it clear that the time of the Once and Future King is upon them... if only they knew where he was. Will wisdom learnt through the eyes of Minerva's owl be enough to prevent disaster? Mostly cannon-compliant for both series.

** Right, I can give out my favorite recommendation again: linkffn(A long journey homne by rakeesh)

The story arc from chapter 4 is exactly what you want. It contains a variant of the entire story of Merlin, from childhood to death, including Arthur and stuff. I think you can start right at chapter 4 and ignore chapters 1 - 3 - however, I recommend the entire fic.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)
