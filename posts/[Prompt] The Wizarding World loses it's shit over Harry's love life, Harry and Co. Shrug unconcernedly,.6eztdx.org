Got a Prompt for people. If you take it up PM me. I'd like to read it if it gets done.

Harry and Hermione spent most of fourth fifth and sixth years as Friends with benefits and regardless of that fact never developed romantic inclinations for each other. Some time after the war with Voldemort Everyone expect Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione to fly apart following the revelation of this 'sordid tale'.

Thing is Ron and Ginny always knew and don't really think about it all that much. Basically Gossip society falls apart so much the Wizarding World at large picks up on it and starts to speculate as well.

Meanwhile the four of them are busy being deliriously happy in each others company and the most anybody get out of them about it is a figurative shrug and "Meh".


** "Another round?"

"Sure."

The bartender discretely poured the two ladies two more firewhiskeys, and pretended not to overhear their conversation.

"Anyway, mum said that you need to clear out the bloody garnen gnomes again. It's been two weeks since you've been over, and she's still cooking as if you're over for dinner every night. You should have seen the table creaking under the weight!" Ginny punctuated this with a poke to Ron's ever-growing belly.

"HEY! Hands off the goods, or I'll sic Hermione on you!" Ron reached over for the bowl of peanuts again, and stuffed a large handful into his mouth.

"Ronald, will you please chew with your mouth closed? People are going to think you were raised by trolls."

Neither sibling noticed Pansy Parkinson gliding into the bar, seeing the two, and moseying on over to their table.

"Ron! Ginny! How ARE you?"

Ron tried to respond, not remembering that his mouth was still full of peanuts, while Ginny gave Pansy an exasperated eye-roll directed at her brother.

"I sometimes think that Ron was left at our doorstep by wolves, but then I look at him and dad, and see the similarities. We were just catching up. Looks like you've been shopping."

It had been four years since they'd last seen Pansy, but they did still exchange the occasional holiday letter. Pansy preened at the two, and discretely tucked the bags of clothes under the table.

"I have been shopping, but I didn't come over to show you the latest fashions. I just heard the most dreadful, scandalous gossip, and I wanted to make sure you two were prepared for the incoming shit-storm."

Ron had managed to finish swallowing by that point. "Oh god, what is it this time?" The bartender came over, and set down their drinks. "The usual, Ms Parkinson?"

"Thank you," she said, as she slid over a few galleons to the bartender. "This round's on me."

"I'm never one to refuse a free drink, but what's so earth-shattering that you think we need it," Ginny asked.

"Well. I just heard from Draco, who heard from Blaise, who heard from Lee Jordan, who heard from Madam Pompfrey, who had walked in on it, that Harry Potter and Hermione Granger were having it off for the entirety of fifth year, and half of sixth year!"

"Yes." said Ron. "Apparently everyone forgot that they were having it off during fourth year too. I guess everyone was so caught up with the TriWizard Tournament that they didn't notice."

"Seriously, Pansy. I thought everyone knew," said Ginny.

Pansy's face fell, although she quickly covered it by accepting her drink from the bartender.

"You mean you both knew?"

"Yeah," said Ron. "He's my best mate. We tell each other everything."

"You seriously think I'd get with a fumbling virgin? I had my pick of at least four boys, all of whom were quite good kissers," said Ginny.

Pansy was speechless for a moment, but recovered quickly. "You KNEW all this time, and still wanted to continue relations with them?"

Ron chuckled. "When you're fearing for your life, because a mad dark wizard keeps trying to kill you when you're of school age, little things like who you're shagging take a back seat to all of that."

"Hermione's a lovely woman, but she's no Quidditch player. The makeup sex after beating the everloving crap out of him in a one-on-one match can never be matched by the fumblings of a preteen at Hogwarts. Harry's madly in love with me."

Pansy was silently cursing under her breath. Rita was not going to like this at all. "You weren't even upset when you found out intially?"

Both siblings looked at Pansy with a rather bland expression and shrugged in unison, with a "Meh."

** You could do that with any kind of scandalous relationship.

Harry's got the Delacour sisters on a literal leash(dom/sub relationship), but the Ministry 6 care fuck all about what the world has to say about it because everyone is happy, Harry most especially.

Hermione's in a polygamous relationship with Ron, Luna, and Malfoy. Nobody knows how the fuck that happened, but the DA has their back no matter what.

And so on.

*** for sure, But part of the fun for me is just how terrifyingly Jealous the four of them are capable of being. So everyone is expecting this hellish argument with wands drawn but they're all to busy being young and in love.

**** What I read from your post was mostly an indifference to public opinion.

***** Ah. Didn't get my thought across I guess. It's not so much that they're all indifferent, because they pretty much are, it's that the people around them are not indifferent and are pretty much having a collective "What? I don't even-Why aren't you all screaming yet!"

** Don't you think you're stretching the believability of those characters a bit much. In particular Ginny and Ron. If anything ever happened between H/Hr I can't see Ron being totally cool with it - ever. Even as some kind of deathbed confession of Harry towards his best friend might be too soon.

He's so obsessed over having something that Harry doesn't get to have too (Hermione) that it's literally the first thing on his mind after returning to them on the hunt.
