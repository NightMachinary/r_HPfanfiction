** Doesn't live up to the first few chapters, sadly.

I know it's just my opinion, but I wouldn't have minded a crazier version of canon, but this is just too over the top, sadly.

It's not even that it's not canon, really - it's just getting too crazy. Compare it with "Oh god not again", "A back comedy" or even 7th Horcrux where it doesn't get more outlandish every chapter and instead hilarity is created by other means.

It's kind of a similar problem that older fics by nonjon (browncoat, green eyes) partially have. For example the peeves/slaceship scene has the same problem, where as in ABC it doesn't get crazier.

Harry doesn't get more powers, the characters remain consistent, and stuff doesn't get more extreme for the sake of it.

Still, I did enjoy the fic, especially the beginning is wonderful.

*** True. Could not have said it better myself.
