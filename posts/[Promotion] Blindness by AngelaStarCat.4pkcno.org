#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** I've enjoyed reading this story. The chapter updates are infrequent enough that when I get a notice of a new one, I usually have to go back and reread the previous couple of chapters.

** Harry is absurdly powerful and Hermione manages, as is often the case in H/Hr, to be very irritating. That said, I find the Hallows plot line very intriguing, so hopefully the author delivers something suitably epic.

** Definitely worth a read, though as I got into it I remember it losing its magic. Never could quite make sense of some of the latter events that occur. Still, definitely worth a read.
