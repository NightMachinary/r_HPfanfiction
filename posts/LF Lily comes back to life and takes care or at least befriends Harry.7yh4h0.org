Are there any stories where Lily makes a comeback and looks after her son? Preferably without outright slipping into a mother role (would be a little weird after a decade since their age difference would be 10 years at most) and her becoming some sort of big sister/favourite aunt instead. Please, no slash, canon pairings or Snape redemptions.

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.

***** I liked it because IMO Shiva was one of the best "teacher/mentor" figures I have read so far. She was neither ridiculously OP nor was she one-dimensional (not just academics or pranks like you see far too often). Even the harem was not too bad (best one I know, but that is not saying much) but it would have been better as two couples (Harry/Hermione and Tonks/Fleur) who like to have sex together and slowly develop the emotional attachment instead of the "welcome to the team" mentality seen, especially with Daphne. While the characters were rather interchangeable, they were at least more than just arm-candy.

****** True, but then /why/ would Lily be in Limbo? Her soul is whole, isn't it? I mean, a fanfic certainly could find a good way to justify it, but assuming she'd go to the normal Afterlife seems like the default assumption to make since only Voldemort's Horcrux-maimed soulbits, and Harry because of the Elder-Wand-Mother's-Blood-Horcrux combo, were ever seen in Limbo.

(Also, what do you mean Voldemort's out-of-body experience? From Dumbledore's description, it seems clear that the flayed-baby-thing Harry sees in the ethereal King's Cross is not the soul of the /main/ Voldemort, but the shard of it in Harry's scar.)

Harry Potter and the... By Sorcerer's Muse

Long series and I haven't kept up with it. But the first two books were excellently written.

I'm not a huge fan of the whole resurrected!Lilly trope in general though.

Haven't given up on A Witch, a wizard, and a Mechanic linkffn(11984787) yet though. Temporal Knight (the beta) is still around, so here's hoping

  A pre-Hogwarts tale that will be the first of eight books retelling the tale of Harry Potter. An exploration of the Many World's theory where changing one thing changes everything and at the same time changes nothing.
