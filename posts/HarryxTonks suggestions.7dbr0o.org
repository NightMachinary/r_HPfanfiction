Hi. I am in need of your help. I remember I read a fanfiction where Harry meets the Guard during fourth year and falls in love with her. However she loves Lupin and asks Sirius to say no to Harry...I think it was six year when Lupin rejects Tonks in favour of Harry....know such fanfic?


** I remember reading this not too long ago, I also recall it was a 30kish word one shot right?

EDIT: I fuckin found it! it was bothering me that i couldnt remember it so i searched through a thousand fics with the tonks filter on ff.net linkffn(12207413)
