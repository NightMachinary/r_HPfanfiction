:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fanfiction where the neighbors at Privet Drive help Harry by tricking the Dursleys using gossip.


** An example that I sort of remember is that the neighbors come up with a script and part of the script is to mention how scrawny Harry is and how much he needs to eat and petunia make sure that he seen eating out on the back porch.

*** There's also a scene where they mention that he needs to have his eyes checked regularly (which to give Petunia credit, she didn't realize), so he gets new glasses.

** Are you looking to find if such a fic exists? Or trying to find one where it actually happens? If so, do you have any more details?

** Hey, I just ran across that fic I mentioned!!! It only took a month, LOL. It's unfinished, which is why I didn't find it when I looked before.

#+begin_quote
  Petunia & Harry become a team, and Harry finds the wizarding world much earlier than anyone suspects. He hides his Slytherin self under the guise of a naive Gryffindor. He also hides the wizard friendships he made years before Hogwarts. AU
