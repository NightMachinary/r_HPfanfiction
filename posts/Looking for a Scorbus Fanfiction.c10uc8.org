:FlairText: What's That Fic? Really cute Scorbus Fanfic I.m looking for.
:END:
​

Edit: I managed to find it. It's called “Hardly a challenge” by MaidenofBagend on archive of our own.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7727617/chapters/17613556#workskin]]

I'm looking for a specific fanfic I read about a couple of months ago. I don't read fanfics so this particular one was kinda memorable for me being one of the few I read. Now I can't find it again .

I posted this on [[/r/harrypotterfanfiction][r/harrypotterfanfiction]] twice but didn't have any luck. I thought i might as well try here,

It had a lot of chapters, all of them started with a time of day and date. It was kinda like a diary. Most of the story was from Albus' POV.

I'll just bullet mark the points that stood out for me. Hope it helps.

• The story also had a few OCs.

• Albus and Scorpius meet on the train (first year) and Albus shares some chocolate frogs and smoking candy with Scorpius and they have a talk about Hogwarts' famous figures. Both were alone in the cabin.

• Scorpius admires Harry a lot and is a history geek.

• Albus gets sorted into Slytherin and he absolutely hates it. Scorpius on the other hand is overjoyed as he can stay with Albus even more.

• Both Slytherin and Griffendor kids make fun of Albus driving him crazy because he's Slytherin. He often cried along with Scorpius in the bathroom ;_;

• Albus and Scorpius share a room in the dorm.

•Albus is bullied a lot and James (being a bit mean to his brother, in the book) still helps his brother.

•James has an OC girlfriend who's the dorm leader.

• Albus and scorpius are always together and spend time alone near the bashing willow..it's kinda forbidden to go there.

• They eat food together and once James challenged Scorpius to a bean boozled type challenge and Albus gets jealous.

• Rose was gay in the beginning and had an OC girlfriend who she broke up with on dance night.

• She later starts dating Scorpous who has a crush on her after being rejected twice.

• Around their second year, Scorpius' mother dies and he's devastated by it. He collapses and Albus gets worried sick.

• Scorpius is in the Quidditch team while Albus isn't. Here was scene after a match where Albus finds himself attracted to Scorpius' (sweat) scent.

• Albus starts to like Scorpius but he's oblivious to his own feeling.

• He gets jealous whenever Scorpius is with Rose and gets himself an OC girl friend while learning to fly some mystical creature (I forgot what) in Hagrid's class.

• Lily and a cousin join Hogwarts the next year and Lily immediately notices that Albus likes Scorpius...like they play footsies and are stuck at the hip together.

• She tries to get them together by making a love smoke/potion.

• Albus doesn't find the spark in kissing his girlfriend anymore. Once he's together on a tree with Scorpius and he desires to teach Scorpius how to kiss. They both kiss and get caught by Lily who was standing under the tree with the love potion/smoke thingy.

• They come home for vacation and Scorpius stays with the Potters. Albus realises he feels more than just friends with Scorpius and wonders what he'll do now.

I think the part where I stopped reading, they were in fourth or fifth year.

In the story, Albus has temper managemant issues. Scorpius is an adorable dork. Jame acts like shit but he's protective of Albus when it comes to bullying. Lily is really bright and famous in school.

The date and time thing stood out for me with regards to the layout of the story.

Also, I don't remember if I read it on archive of our own or fanfiction.net but I'm sure as hell it had an Original character tag on it. I don't know how to search with tags and I've tried my best to find it but I'm at loss here. If it helps, I read it early

last year. Thank you for taking your time to read this post.

Any help is deeply appreciated. Have a nice day

  Albus Potter has always tried his hardest to live up to his family's name, whereas Scorpius Malfoy has always tried his hardest not to. When they arrive at Hogwarts, they are determined to have nothing to do with one another. What happens when these two opposites collide and realise they may not be so different from each other after all? Albus/Scorpius, slow build, not CC compliant

***** Thank you very much for the recommendations! I'd like to read more of your recommendations :) I really appreciate that you're taking your time to help me :) I've read that fanfic twice and it used to to be the first link that popped up while searching for scorbus and I regret not bookmarking it. I've searched lots and I can only fear that the author might have deleted it or that it's too good at hiding from me. It was very recently updated too so I wonder why I can't find it. But thank you very much for help and the recommendations. Do let me know if you find it, I'll be waiting not matter how long it takes :) And I'm sorry if it's driving you nuts ;_; I'll be on the search constantly as well. Have a lovely day!

  Ginny Potter estimates it will only take three days into the Weasley-Potter family holiday for Albus to act on his feelings for his best friend. Albus estimates it will only take three days for him to die of embarrassment. And Scorpius, well. Scorpius is just glad to be there with Albus in the first place.
