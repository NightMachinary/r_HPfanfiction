I've been curious about this idea for a while but haven't been able to find anything good. I'd also settle for Grindlewald or Dumbledore. No slash please, preferably fics over 80k and not abandoned (nothing worse). Thanks!


** While I know of a number of Moody as mentor stories, none are >80k words and not abandoned, so I'll not mention them.

Perspicacity's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152930/1/Dagger-and-Rose][Dagger and Rose]] has Dumbledore taking an active mentoring role. Similarly for Sib's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1709027/1/The-Awakening-Power][The Awakening Power]] and Abraxan's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2163835/1/The-Refiners-Fire][The Refiner's Fire]] series.

Kmfrank's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4815342/1/Escape-to-Darkness][Escape to Darkness]] has Grindelwald as mentor, but you won't like it (it's only 50k words and abandoned).

*** As the author of Escape to Darkness, it isn't abandoned. I just haven't written it in a quick minute.

My other story Unlocked Knowledge got an update after like 5 years, so Escape might be due for one soon...

*** Thanks for the recs! Of those I've read Dagger and Rose (and loved it), as well as Escape to Darkness (really disappointed this one is abandoned).

I started The Awakening but I'm pretty put off by the romance angle right off the bat. I'm not necessarily opposed to some romance but this seems pretty forced.

*** Thanks for the rec. I've avoided his one shot archive for the longest time because I prefer longer fics, are those the worth breaking a rule for?

**** I too prefer longer fics, but I'd say its worth it. Afterall, I did spend the rest of the day reading the one shots.

There are some problems (e.g. sometimes stories are repeated with only minor changes), but for the most part they are worth it. Just remember to feel free to skip ahead if you're not liking a story.

** There was a moody mentoring oc fic that included a really detailed dueling system, anyone remember? I think it had some elemental aspects, quite long

** If I recall correctly, '[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3214743/1/Trinity][Trinity]]' has Moody training Harry, Ron and Hermione to be pretty freaking badass. This fic is fantastic even if that's not what you're looking for - one of the first I ever read, and it's stayed with me for years.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8616362/1/Harry-Potter-The-Last-Avatar][Harry Potter & The Last Avatar]] features a mentor-Moody, it's fairly long at this point and seems to be updated regularly. It's also a really good Avatar: The Last Air Bender crossover. Personally, I'm not an obsessive fan of the TV show, it was far after my time. That said I definitely think it works really well in this FF.

  Why is Harry Potter considered the worst firebender in Gryffindor? Why doesn't he want to be noticed? Probably the same reason he dreams of drowning every night.
