  Harry Potter has just received his Hogwarts letter, but really doesn't want to go. After all, who would want to live on a planet? Especially one where the natives think nuclear energy is high science. And let's not forget the 42,000 lightyear commute.

***** It might have been a different one. The one I'm thinking of also had Harry use some weird apparition that bypasses Hogwarts wards, and he saves Hermione from the Troll when he visits with his guardian, iirc.
