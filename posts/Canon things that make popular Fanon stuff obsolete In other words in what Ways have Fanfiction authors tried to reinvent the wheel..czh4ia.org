I would say that Golden Snitch Flesh Memories make the "Super duper " Blood Locks that they have Harry get on his Diagon alley trip obsolete. Why have a Lock that you need to prick you finger on every time when you can have one that Open only at your touch.

I don't mean stuff that is better, But stuff that is inferior to stuff that is already in the books Like the Blood locks compared to Flesh memories.

**** I wasn't going to touch on which was more interesting but I disagree now that you bring it up, and most certainly not by a longshot. Just because you move all the effects over to Runes to make it interesting doesn't mean you couldn't have just done that within the canon constraints, which would provide the same depth as fanon Runes offer while leaving Ancient Runes open for some more depth to instead of just changing what subject has what and not adding anything. As for Arithmancy, considering what we know of it and Divination in canon I don't think too many fanon ideas actually go against canon in that regard (other than the obvious “prophecies are BS” fics”)

Think about it. Rowling writes about a shadow world with it's own shadow government that operates outside of and in most cases above mundane authority. She'd have to be very careful how she portrays anything involving a Chinese magical government, and from her recent output it's obvious she couoldn't be bothered to be careful.

It's also one of the theories explaining why she's so outspoken about Dumbledore being gay on twitter and in interviews, yet so far the Fantastic Beasts movies have only addressed it tangentially. A ban in China would be terrible for box office takings.

Fun thing is, there should be no magical Germany since the desire for a unified nation came from the power vacuum left behind by Napoleon. Which gives you countless small states in a loose union, including more than 30 semi-independent city-states. Which would make magical academia more than a little tricky if each gets their own.

The Trace spell is linked directly to the caster, who knows what the monitored person is up to at all times. This wouldn't make sense in fanon, where there have to be a hundred Ministry workers who presumably have to keep track of thousands of children's wands, 24/7.

** Wands! Harry ends up with some super-duper basilisk fang/demontor bone/chimera snot monstrosity in a lot of fanfiction.

But in Canon, wand makers have spent centuries testing and determined that unicorn hair, dragon heartstring and phoenix feather are the absolute best wand cores. So that's what everyone uses.

*** That's actually /Ollivander's/ opinion and while he's the only wandmaker we get to actually know in any sense, there are certain to be others with different opinions with their own secrets that they wouldn't share with the wider world.

Fanon, I believe, is well within its rights to give Harry any kind of wand it wishes, so long as it is done well.

I think we see that during the Weighing of the Wands, where Ollivander notes that he doesn't use Veela hair, even though he okays it and performs some magic with it.

There's also [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Wand#Wands_and_wandlore][a list]] of various materials used, many of which Ollivander doesn't use but which seem to perform well (including Wampus hair).

*** We know that there are other wand cores that work just as well, if not better than the three Ollivander's uses. There's an american wandmaker that uses Thunderbird feathers, for example. The Elder Wand has a thestral hair as a core. Salzar Slytherin had a horn from his basilisk.

Apart from that, your connection to the animal it came from is probably important as well, for example, if your animagus form is a thunderbird, one of your own feathers would probably make an incredible wand core.

*** Yeah, it is already bad enough to justify almost any plot, including Harry murdering them without the need to resort to Dudley and Vernon eating Hedwig roast.

Now, getting them convicted might be a little tricky, but with magic, it would be easy to plant a few tons of pure cocaine on them, and that carries the same 14 year prison sentence.

**** Harry usually doesn't murder them. Instead, he let them just beat him like a slave who doesn't know what self-defense is. It's the same Harry who is brave to face off Tom Riddle, Dementors, a dragon and Basilisk.

Then, there's the Harry who forgives them and even give them millions to "fix" things between.

And there's the wimp Harry who's afraid of his own shadow. Everything is his fault. Therefore, it's his fault if the Dursleys hate him.
