:END:
Harry got into a private school, but still had to return to the Dursley house at the end of the day. Did not want to attend Hogwarts, as it was not in his plan, told McG that, and someone memory-charmed the school's Headmaster to tell Harry he couldn't stay. Last chapter ended with Harry convincing the Headmaster to keep him on the roll, but he'd send his homework in through a messenger service.


** I don't think this is exactly what you wanted, but it's the only fic that I've read that's anywhere close to what you're looking for.
