Completed and preferably long! Thanks


** A little shameless self-promo here, but you know. I've written several Dramiones.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12415305/1/Metaphysicka][Metaphysicka]] Post-Hogwarts, 75,084 words, Complete.

Hermione was researching potions. Draco was researching his family's ties to alchemy. When their research overlaps, are two stubborn heads more productive than one? Or will they let their past get in the way of the most exciting discovery either of their research has turned out to date?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12458581/1/There-Was-A-Time][There Was a Time]] Post-Hogwarts, 51,267 words, Complete. Also includes Theo Nott. A chance meeting in Knockturn Alley left Draco and Hermione puzzled. Suddenly, Draco was asking questions that Hermione couldn't answer, and Draco was answering questions that Hermione had never thought to ask.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12673516/1/Whiskey-Roses][Whiskey & Roses]] Post-Hogwarts, 38,047 words, complete. Draco was trying to support his son. Hermione was just trying to survive. When he ends up teaching her how to live again, she offers to teach him how to love again.

#+begin_quote
  It takes the unexpected engagement of their children to get Draco and Hermione in a room together, but only the selfish acts of their estranged spouses and a 300 Galleon bottle of firewhiskey will get them in a bedroom. What starts out as a one time mistake soon becomes a full-blown affair with a deadline; the day their children say 'I do'. But things rarely go according to plan.
