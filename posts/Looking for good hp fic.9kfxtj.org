As I said, I'm looking for a hp fic, not slash or HP/GW, HP/HG. Not OP!HP or something like that. Maybe a fic in which Harry gets stronger in time? As an example ,,On the way to greatness" which was great but abandoned. Or something like Magicks of the Arcane. Meaning interesting magic, Harry getting stronger by working on it and good plot. Any pairing are good beside the one listed above. Hope to see fics I haven't read before 😂


** linkffn(3557725) involves Harry (and Ron and Hermione) working to become more powerful after Ginny dies in the Chamber of Secrets. No pairings, and sadly unfinished.

Harry and Tonks have to flee Britain and end up travelling across Europe while several parties (The Ministry, Voldemort, the Spanish magical government) are after them. Harry is roughly at his canon level of abilities, which means that, at least for now, Tonks is the better fighter since she went through years of formal training whereas Harry had a year in the DA and some practice for the tournament.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

  End of 3rd year. While Sirius is on trial to prove his innocence, Harry is abandoned by the Dursleys who, after the Marge incident, have enough of him. Luckily Harry's picked up by Bill Weasley. And ends up joining Bill on a Cursbreaking expedition to Cambodia. He gets far more than he asking for! Disturbing news, promises, trouble and danger keep following Harry's every step.

*The Meaning of Mistletoe*

I really like this four part fic. He's kinda op but in a non traditional way and it isn't an immediate thing. And he's awful at traditional magic.

But the reason I like it is because it's just very good. It starts off small and just expands. To put things into perspective, my favourite character was Percy Weasley.

The magic is really interesting too I feel. Not seen anyone else do it the same way.

I'd give it a better rep but I'm in class rn. Its just great.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.
