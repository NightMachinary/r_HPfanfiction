Hello! I'm writing a Fanfiction by the name of linkffn(Henrietta Potter and the Secret of the Horcrux), and while it has about 95 follows, it only has 7 reviews. Now, while I am pleased about this, it is disheartening when I don't have anyone to bounce ideas off. Currently, I am in the process of writing chapter 4, but I find it difficult to continue with no real critics on it. So I am asking if anyone would like to beta read, review or just be there to help along the way.

Thank you.

** I just read a few paragraphs and already saw a good dozen things I would have cut, corrected or changed.

If you want me to look over it, you may send me a PM. Ideally send me a Google Drive link with Comments enabled.

PS: I like the name Henrietta.

** I'll be reviewing here: [[https://gist.github.com/anonymous/bb15d7ef1e28c5082c83c9cc696d971e]]

I'm editing it live, so it might take a while.

Edit: We are done, I replaced the link with a backup of what we wrote.
