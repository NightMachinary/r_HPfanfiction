I desperately crave content with Draco and Sirius interacting. After throughly scouring the internet for it, I'm quite positive that this is hella lacking from most content, and guys it's so disappointing.

I have so many ideas about Draco and Sirius, and I see so much potential for fics, I can't believe that it's so rarely written about.

It's to the point now where I'm literally writing a Draco and Sirius centric fic bec I can't handle this content not being out there with how fascinating I find it.

What do you guys think? Does the idea of Sirius and Draco interacting sound interesting to you?

Should I share some of my Sirius and Draco prompt ideas? bec I have a hella lotta content for it


** I know this post is old, but I found it searching for something else and I'd think you'd like this fic. Sirius and Remus adopt Draco at one point and the fic focuses a lot on wandlore.

** That sounds great to me! You should definitely write it if you feel inspired.

There's some nice Draco and Sirius interaction in the [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/series/631214][Secret Language of Plants]] series by Endrina, but it's not central.

** Honestly, based on how this fandom treats Malfoy, I'm kinda glad. Like, the thing that would make this dynamic interesting, the fact that Malfoy uncritically accepts all of his family's awful beliefs where Sirius rejected them, is widely ignored by most writers, who, from what I can tell, seem to either write him as if he isn't an entitled, supremacist, classist bully, or not see anything wrong with him being an entitled, supremacist, classist bully.

** It's not exactly what you're looking for but Flawed Perfection by Celebony (sequel to recnac transfaerso) explores this a little bit. It is decided that Snape should help Harry overcome his abuse and Sirius should help Draco.

** Growing up Black has Sirius adopting Draco in it, but sadly it's abandoned.

** How do you see their dynamic working out? Would they be bickering or have a camaraderie because of the darker parts of their life? I'm curious now lol.

  Cedric Diggory is dead, Voldemort is reborn. Narcissa Malfoy knows what this means for her son, and she will not let him be Marked. Even if it means fleeing Britain.With Amelia Bones' help, a safe haven welcomes six teenagers who have no wish to bow to Voldemort. The only catch? They'll need to adapt to a Muggle lifestyle.With private teachers to continue their schooling, isolated from the rest of the world, they certainly don't expect to enjoy themselves, especially after Harry Potter himself joins them. A story where Umbridge wreaks havoc on Hogwarts and Harry is not there to see it.
