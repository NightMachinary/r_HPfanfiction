I was thinking this would be a fun misdirect direction to take the story given that the canon story in COS is otherwise /so/ focused on snakes, bathrooms and the school's history.

Instead of those - or Ginny and the Diary plot having /anything/ to do with the attacks, necessarily - the forest Acromantula colony have finally realized; why content themselves with eating mundane deer, rabbits, and the like in the forest when just within range live easy, magically-imbued prey who have no idea of their very existence, or how to defend themselves. Friend Hagrid is a giant after all - not even quite the same species as these small tasty ones! What can be the harm?

E: For clarity, I intended the second question - whether Hagrid should be to blame or not - to be part of the prompt - not a discussion piece.

Rather than /<in this circumstance, is Hagrid always to blame>/, more along the lines of /<in an AU where the acromantula were the monster, would you write it with an absent-minded Hagrid who refused to believe it, or with a Hagrid who deliberately set them on Hogwarts in an act of revenge against those who wronged him?>/


** The real fault lies with whoever allowed a large colony of violent, potentially human eating spiders to nest so close to a school for decades. It's not like the whole mess with Aragog wasnt out in the open, they could have easily called the Ministry to take out the Acromantulas, or move them. The real fault, if they started killing students, would be on the Headmaster. Probably Dumbledore, something tells me Dippet didnt knew Aragog stuck around in the Forest.

*** I personally believe the Forbidden Forest area is Wizarding britain's equivalent of a national park and that it's required to be preserved. Species like the centaurs, unicorns, acromantulas, etc were probably the first inhabitants of that land and the founders built the school around an environment perfect for exploration of magical flora & fauna.

** I don't think Hagrid would be to blame, honestly. The acromantulas seem too sentient and self-aware to not be held accountable for their own actions. Of course the Wizarding world at large is less likely to recognize the autonomy of the spiders.

Maybe a moral decision from the protagonist at the end is required about whether to reveal the spiders and put Hagrid on trial or deal with the spiders secretly, protecting Hagrid in the process.

*** I meant more that you could decide in your story whether or not Hagrid decided to unleash them on the school. Tbh its not like Hagrid doesn't have any reason to hold a grudge - this school expelled him and has him working there as a menial labourer for a bunch of prejudiced pureblood kids, for example.

***** You made good points too! I like it. That even where Hagrid didn't /intentionally/ unleash the spiders, he might be the root cause through some combination of introducing them to the forest, or not warning others about them - presumably Dumbledore knew they were there, but is there canonical evidence for that??

** If an acromantula attacked and killed a student on Hogwarts grounds, Hagrid is culpable. He introduced the foreign, hostile species into the area. If not for him, they wouldn't have a colony. Hagrid released Aragog accidentally (after being attacked by Tom Riddle), but at some point, he procured Mosag as a companion for Aragog. They bred and created the colony.

Blame is shared with the Headmaster(s) that knew of the colony.

If the Department for Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures knew of the colony, they are culpable.

If the greater DMLE knew of the colony and did nothing, they are culpable as well.

In terms of criminal charges, Hagrid and the Headmaster at the time of the attack would be criminally negligent.

In a sensible civil court system, Hagrid and the Headmaster personally, Hogwarts (as an institution), the heads of the DRCMC and DMLE, and the Minister as acting in their positions (not personally) would be civilly liable.

** As an adult entrusted with the safety of students he would be at least partially responsible. He's not a next door neighbor who has nothing to do with the school, he is part of the staff and as such his responsibilities are greater than those of an average person. And honestly - sending Harry and Ron to the forest should have counted as attempted murder. They both would have died had the car not been there and that was complete coincidence.
