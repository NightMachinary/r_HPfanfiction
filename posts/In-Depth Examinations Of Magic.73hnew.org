** List below contains, generally, a studious Harry & expansions on the canonically defined magic & magic systems (though sometimes highly AU). These are all pretty much common recs (for the most part), but I can't think of anything else right now.

Wit of the Raven, linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2740505/1/Wit-of-the-Raven]]) - fantastic stuff, pretty AU.

Prince of the Dark Kingdom, more info on some magic, expands on magical religion, etc., linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom]]).

There's the Pureblood Pretense series, of course, for potions; linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/]]).

Even more obvious choice, but Harry Potter & The Boy Who Lived, linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived]])

The Art of Self-Fashioning, of course, for transfiguration, linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11585823/]]).

HP & The Untitled Tome, generally more studious & different magic; linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10210053/]]).

HP & The Accidental Horcrux, more studious, expansion on some magic; linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11762850/]])

Death of Today, linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5402147/1/Death-of-Today]]) - slash, but I recall there being fairly detailed examinations of magic, inventions, etc.

C'est La Vie, runes, linkffn([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3390668/]]).

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

#+begin_quote
  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret. In the meantime, Chief-wizard Malfoy has his eyes set on Hogwarts, and only Sir Albus stands in his way.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.
