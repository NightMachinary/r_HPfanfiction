the fanfic was called 'The' Harry Potter will notice 'invisible' Ravenclaw girl?! Yeah right?!! (Harry Potter Love Story)

it was on quizilla and the writers name was "whatdreamsaremadeof"

I adored that story back in 2009-2010 and I just discovered the archive of quizilla so I was super excited when I saw that the author said that she published it in another place but she never mentioned where

anything u know helps

(again idk where this post will go I have no idea how reddit works)


** Can you post a link to the fic from quizilla?

Try taking key phrases from the fic and googling them with quotes around it
