  After being soundly defeated at The Battle of Hogwarts, Lord Voldemort is given a second chance at life. However, is everything as it appears? DH spoilers. AU.

*** Those fics portray him as ultimately good though, and I get the impression that OP was asking for a fix-it that would make the DEs win.

  When Voldemort died at the Battle of Hogwarts, nothing had prepared him to reawaken as Tom Riddle circa 1943, rid of his madness but left with a gnawing sense of defeat. Things may have gone wrong the first time around, but Tom vowed not to let the course of history run unchanged. He could do better, and this time... no one would stop him.
