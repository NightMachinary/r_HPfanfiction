So, apparently Fridwulfa and 'Mr Hagrid' were actually married, not just together for one sesh of the 'ole one-two' before separating. What if Fridwulfa never left and they were both still in Hagrid's life for awhile afterward (maybe even up to the books time period) and were just incredibly supportive parents (think Worf's parents in TNG) that only wanted Hagrid to be happy and doted on him to embarrassing degrees?

Any fics that deal with Hagrid's parentage or childhood, or have his parents together and they get to meet and dote on Harry?


** Now I'm wondering who officiated their wedding. What were their vows, etc? Did their families approve?

*** And how did they even meet? Did they go on a blind date? Meet down the shops? Is there some kind of Wizard Tinder?

**** My headcanon is that Hagrid's dad was hiking in the mountains, and found Fridwulfa trapped and injured under an avalanche. He then uses magic to get her out but has no skill at healing, so nurses her back to health the old fashioned way. In return for saving her and helping her, she shows him her world, and they fall in love.

***** I like that. Very whirlwind, 'One night in Paris' of you. It'd also explain, sadly, why she left after Hagrid was born. Affection of events not matching up to the long term images.

...

Sorry for cynic-ing up your prompt. :D
