I already put this in the discord but I just had to put it here too. This a post-war AU fic in which Harry loses the war. I don't want to give too much away because part of the beauty is deciphering the situations for yourself. It's fucked up, bizarre and brilliant, but do be warned it is very dark.The image of Hermione squeezing blood out of her hands into a jar that contains Harry's ashes and wreaking some mad blood magic hell is fucking incredible
