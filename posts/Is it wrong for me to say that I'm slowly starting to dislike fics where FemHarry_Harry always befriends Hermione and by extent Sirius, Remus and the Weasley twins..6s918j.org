** Definitely not! Though given that my favorite fics are the ones where the troll takes care of Hermione offscreen I may be a tad biased.

**** Gives me the idea for a crack fic. SI as the troll.

Your only job is to kill Hermione.

Stuck in a loop that zaps you back to the day that Hermione was sorted.

When you finally do kill her, the ROB says it's lacking in elegance. Do it again!

I can just imagine a troll dressed in golfing gear sneaking into Hogsmede and doing a happy gilmore swing with an oversized golf club on her.

** I'm usually biased against any fic that has her as best friend/confidant/lover, etc. Hermione having a starring roll is just stale for me, at this point. I don't relate to her at all and I'm quite happy to read something that will expand upon someone other than her and Ginny.

As for the Dubious Duo and the Faux Mauraders, they're a package deal in most fics. For once I'd like to see a twin fic that has the Twins not sharing everything, and deliberately keeping things private between the two like you would any sibling you only mostly get along with.

*** I dont mind a good weasley bash, but a weasley bash that still throws love on the twins really annoys me. In alt weasley takes, I much prefer the twins as unhinged bullies.

*** You have to read linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin). The twins go completely separate ways: one is academic, one isn't; [[/spoiler][one gets expelled,]] the other doesn't. Great story.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
