Loved the engagement last time; let's see if we can do it again! You can recommend *completed* fics through [[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdtBhOHJwuY8VeDpnMHzTGhYLeJKbyVhORXXo98359wwn1lnw/viewform][this form]], and [[https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=Psantium_&subject=/r/HPfanfiction%20Book%20Club][PM me]] if you have any suggestions.

--------------

What did y'all think about *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/][Too Young to Die]]*? Let me know in the comment section down below!

The next fic is *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4798208][An Interview with Justin Finch-Fletchley]]* by /ajarntham/. It's in the unique format of a radio interview on the WWW, and it explores the lead up to the Voldemort's reign, and the events thereafter. This fic is quite short, so I'll probably hold two book clubs this month, so read up!

** Too Young to Die is one of those fics that is full of glaring flaws and can't quite be considered well written, but I honestly have a soft spot for it. It's probably the only fic I've read where practicing Dark Magic actually has a negative effect on Harry, and its ending was pretty hype.

The first few chapters are definitely in need of some work, not so much in the form of grammar but in plot. We're not really given much chance to bond with Natasha before she's killed, so we don't really relate to Harry's goal to bring her back.

Harry also attempts to fuck any woman he sets his eyes on, which gets pretty annoying. Though I will admit it's sorta /refreshing/ to see a fic where the harem guy freely admits he's just using the girls for their bodies and what they can offer him. Much better than that whole "Oh yes I love all 16 members of my harem equally we're all soulmates".

** This was one of the first wbwl fics I had read, and maybe one of the first ten Harry Potter fanfics I read. As such, I was able to finish it, but I don't think I could do it today. Too many characters act completely OOC, and the plot progression is badly paced, and the end is disappointing. It is like Princess of the Blacks, but worse in nearly every way.

** Alright, I couldn't get past the first three chapters of this one. Less than halfway through the first one I wanted to drop it, but seeing that I was reading it for this book club I gave it another chance. 3 chapters, if it doesn't get better or gets worse I would drop it. It got worse.

To start with, this fic is every Wrong-Boy-Who-Lived clich√© with the addition that this Harry also had a sister. This sister died, this sister is now motivation. So instead of just vengeance and hate, we have those with the addition of a reason in the form of the sister. I like the concept, it's better than most WBWL fics out there but the execution was not done well.

Firstly, I did not like the writing. There were a few problems but the most glaring annoyance at the beginning was how stilted it was. That is a purely subjective problem, however, as not everyone likes the same writing styles. The real problem is how boring it is. It is boring, and the writing/characters being annoying just adds to the disinterest (the author even adds at the end of chapter 3 that this Harry will be unlikeable). Most characters are ridiculous, in fact i'd equate them with your standard charicature or trope embodiment. The plot is predictable, which again is highlighted with the lack of substance found in the fic as a whole.

I think I could have actually made it farther if the 3rd chapter wasn't so horrible. In the interest of avoiding spoilers (should you want to read it) i'll just say this; Harry's interaction both with Draco and the two women were a bit too much. The latter was forced in for some inane, unknown reason and the former was too over the top. To be clear, the fact that the writing suffers from tone, voice and structure problems made my issues with the fic that much more extenuated. This fic is not for me, I'm sure some people will enjoy it and good for them but i personally did not enjoy anything about it and would not recommend it.

Again, I haven't read the whole thing and I don't plan to.

** This book almost bought me to breaking my 2 year 110 book HP FanFiction streak and pick up something else. I got past half-way.

The protagonist is entirely unlikable. The back-story to him becoming that way is not well presented up front and what is known is unrealistic if we attribute any value to what we learnt of the characters from JKR. With no identification with any of the main characters it is hard to keep going and super bad Harry just makes it harder.

** I'll be honest I could never get through the first 5-6 chapters of this. So what I sometimes do in this case, is pick a chapter near the end and read it. If it captures my interest I go back a few chaters and start from there. I ended up reading everything but the first 25% of this.

So yeah, if this story has one thing going for it, it's entertainment. Crazy weird shit happens all the time; Harry is an inconsistent, amoral, sociopathic douchebag, but you can't help (at least I couldn't help it) wanting to know if he's going to be succesful in his quest.

There's no identifying with this protagonist. Although his motives are supposedly pure, his actions are beyond reprehensible. But, like watching school shooting clips on TV, you can't help but stare in horrified fascination.

Also I loved the ending. It takes balls to end it in this way, and although I was mad at the time, I've realised now how it strengthens the rest of the story. Cause as you read, you start to believe that the world this guy has created is one way; but after you finish it you realise for a long while you were being duped - with your consent.

** Well, I read this actually fairly recently instead of working so.. I had a good reason to finish it.

First the plot is a little eh. The pacing is off in places, and while the character driven concepts are fresh, the fact is we don't get to connect with anyone before something happens to change their characters. (Prime material is Harry)

However this is one of the first works that show what true Dark Magic does to a person who dives into it trying to keep themselves sane. The only other one that does that in my mind is Art of Self Fashioning.

The action and suspense when first read was alright, and the ending while lackluster was the only real way it could have happened. Sure Harry could have gotten away with it, but not without repercussions that he wouldn't be able to take. So the ending worked.

All in all, I would give it a 3.2 out of 5 stars. Not a must read, but definitely something that is better than most of the garbage on the internet rn.

** I remember this fic quite well, it left an ... interesting impression to say the least.

Firstly, the Magic displayed in the Fic becomes incredibly boring for a Fic with the protagonist exploring the literal innards of Magic. Magic is supposed to present the whole

#+begin_quote
  "Turtles all the way down but the farther you go the bigger and scalier the turtles get, with sharper beaks. Until they eventually start looking less like turtles and more like dragons."
#+end_quote

In short, Magic is presented in a way that tries too hard to be overly realistic and overly rational to the Muggle mind. So this automatically makes the fic fall three points out of five.

Next, are the characters. It presents everything wrong with a WBWL fic and wraps it up in a neat little bow. It reminds me a lot of the fic Clash, where most of the characters generally act for no reason and have no real motivations, but the fic tells you they do, so you have to believe it. OverlymatureElvenYearOld!Harry makes his move here, and oh boy. I suppose the author wanted him to be a bit like Tom Riddle, but it just fell and continued falling until we met one of those Dragon Turtles.

Here's a bit what he does wrong.

- Harry isn't really a master of misdirection, the people around him just have no clue what they're doing.

- Lily and James are mean for no reason again. This time it's to two children, honestly, it would make more sense for Harry to be the only one left out instead as he would be somewhere within the middle of Lily and James' priorities, but their youngest child? Why? This is so OOC that you can't call them James or Lily anymore.

- Lily and James don't feel the least bit of apathy for their dead daughter, Nuff said.

- Harry defeats several Aurors just by reading and studying Black Magic in the woods!trope.

- Random Grammatical Errors, words that were misplaced/misspelt/went off into the abyss of Grammar. Not sure if the author ever edited that, but I'm doubtful.

- Dark!Harry achieves his goal but ends up dying/incarcerated/exiled/unknownandentirelyambigious!trope.

Now for what I liked.

- Combat was portrayed in an interesting way, it wasn't in anyway believable in who was fighting who, but it was still a nice breath of fresh air from the incredibly grimdark fic that comes about. However, there's a lot of Gorn, unnecessary Gorn.

- Stays relatively consistent within its boring Magic system.

- Tone stays consistent as well, no real radical tone changes to warrant a minus of any points. Though the lack of variety is a double-edged sword.

Overall going to have to give this a 1/5, wouldn't really read it again.

** A fanfic that would be better served as original fiction. If you can separate the canon HP characters from their OOC counterparts then the world building may save the story for you. It paints a picture of a Harry Potter slowly descending into a rabbit hole of crime and immorality.

If I was going to make my own fan edit I would put in some sections seen through Dumbledore's eyes. Does he regret his actions that indirectly lead to the rise of yet another dark wizard?

** I've tried to read this one repeatedly. Chapter 1 is where I usually stop before remembering why I haven't read this oft recommended fic. I've made it to the 2nd one this time, though not the end. Skimming other chapters has proved that it's not worth my time.

There is one good point: The premise has merit -- anything can if it's done well enough.

This is not done nearly well enough. Even if there was no author's note, it'd be painfully obvious that this was someone's first foray into fics. And I hate it. I hate that Lily and James actively dislike/ignore Harry and his sister (a common sin of this type of fic). I hate that he some how "Slytherins" his way into Hufflepuff and the plot screams along into Dark!Harry at a breakneck pace. I hate that Harry reads like he's five years older than his canon age. And I absolutely hate a semi-decent twist on a tired trope (WBWL) being wasted.

Mostly, though, the quality of writing was the dealbreaker. Interesting or excellent writing can help gloss over a lot of flaws like OOC or glaring plotholes.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

** This story is among the legions of "okay stories". Above average writing for fanfiction.net, but writing and plot that doesn't stand out among the better stories that FFN has to offer.

I finished it back in the day, maybe two or so months after I started reading fanfiction. I'm not confident I could read it to completion today. It just doesn't stand out when there are other WBWL fics that are better.

** I couldn't get behind the Potters pretending they only had one Child. I would like to read one where they act like humans, even if they are horrible humans. Abusive parents often flip between affection neglect and physical abuse, which leaves the child confused and feeling like it is their fault.

Aside from that I think my biggest complaint about this fic is that I had no emotional connection to Natasha. I actually had to double check that I had her name right, and I only read it a week ago. She was Harry's drive, I felt nothing for her, she was an entirely forgettable character.

*** This is sort of a spoiler, but there is an explanation at the end for this that does an ok job of explaining their weird behavior imo. They aren't actually doing it on purpose or even realize what they are doing. Note I only read the the first couple chapters and then skimmed the final chapter as it was too dark/edgy for my taste so I have no idea if the fic was actually good or not.

***** I remember when reading it thinking it seemed like something fishy was going on as they didn't seem realize their other children existed most of the time, so it seemed like they were under some sort of mind altering spell to me. When that was the actual explanation it made sense to me and I assumed it was always supposed to be like that. It's possible the auhor just retconned it later and I was giving them too much credit at the beginning. But for example the quidditch scene makes sense if there's like magical reason for James to forget Harry is there, and doesn't make sense if James is just a dick, so the author intending James to be under a spell seems reasonable to and not forced in later.
