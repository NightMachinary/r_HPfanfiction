  “You understand, Professor,” Harry began, after a moment, “that I don't have my N.E.W.T.s. I never even finished seventh year. Between everything, I never had a chance the first time around, and then afterwards there didn't seem to be much point. Hermione argued for it, of course, but I was so tired of Britain. So technically, I am completely unqualified for the position.”“Quite a way to begin an interview, Mr. Potter,” McGonagall said, dryly.Or, three years after the war, Harry Potter becomes Hogwarts' newest Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.

  At twenty-five, Harry Potter is at a crossroads in his life. He's achieved his dream of being an Auror, but it's not all it's cracked up to be, and with one child and another on the way, he's missing out on precious time with his family. But being an Auror is all he knows how to do - right? So he's in for a surprise when Professor McGonagall, Headmistress of Hogwarts, offers him a job as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher ...

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13318951/1/The-Archeologist][The Archeologist]] has a old&ultra-competent (Curse Breaker) Harry that ends up back in time^{different universe}, as a female... who already died.

So she goes to [[https://bloodborne.fandom.com/wiki/Yharnam][Yharnam]]^{from Bloodborne, video game} to clear it up and establish herself as a major player in the Curse Breaker-business.

She also ends up as the +DADA+ History professor at Hogwarts... and this fic has my favorite depiction of Professor/Teacher-work at Hogwarts.

--------------

ps. The bloodborne crossover isn't pervasive in the fic and only exists as a place for Harry to clear up and reason for her fame.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
