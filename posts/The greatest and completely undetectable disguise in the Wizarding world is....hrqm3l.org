******** You reminded me of a crackfic I read once when Dumbledore finds Snape the Hogwarts student experimenting with his shiny new cutting spell and asks him what it is for. In a panic, Snape replies the first thing he thinks of; "...tailoring." Dumbledore is overjoyed and sets him up to work as a dresser. He can't really say no...

In the end, his life probably ended up something akin to canon Snape's worst nightmare. But at least he got the girl so yay?

  The summer prior to 6th year Harry deals with Tom in a decisive, if accidental manner. That summer Harry gets a girl friend in Susan Bones, and sets about some self improvement. It is after this change to himself he discovers something a bit disturbing about the Wizarding World, something that Hermione Granger is determined to use to her advantage.

*** To be fair, unless they know him personally and stand close to him, that disguise /would/ work quite fine. And the same with shaved Dumbledore. The man had that long beard and hair for decades now, plus his signature flamboyant robes. A short hair, shaven Dumbledore in dark clothes would be a pretty good disguise unless he interacts with someone that knows him personally.
