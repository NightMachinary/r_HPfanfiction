Mrs. Norris is a really weird name for a cat, but a normal one for a human- could Filch's cat be named after a human, or be a cursed human herself?


** ...or maybe Filch is just weird?

** Okay, I don't know if I should be saying this, as you might not be cleared for it, but, seeing as it will be hard to trace this information back to the source...

Mrs. Norris is really a high-level agent sent by the International Confederation of Wizards to watch over Argus Filch. Filch isn't really Filch. In particular, he doesn't remember that he's actually Gellert Grindelwald.

After his defeat by Dumbledore, Grindelwald was repeatedly obliviated and confounded to convince him of the reality of the Filch persona. Just convincing him that he's a squib and unable to perform magic took over six months of careful alterations performed by experts in Geneva. The entire thing took years to do.

Mrs. Norris is in fact a sentient wizard-dragon cat animagus. She was sent to both guard Grindelfilch and to kill him should he ever show any signs of remembering his true identity.

The Grindelwald imprisoned at Nurmengard? He's just a decoy, a poor muggle actor who was convinced to take on the role of Grindelwald in exchange for his family, including his six children, all of whom were afflicted with terrible terminal illnesses, being well looked after.

Why did /they/ go through all this effort? Well you see, Dumbledore was in love with Grindelwald, but Grindelwald, who was not sexually attracted to Dumbledore at all, wanted nothing to do with him. Even so, Dumbledore pined away for him for years, and when it became obvious that only he could stop Grindelwald's conquest of Europe, he still couldn't be convinced by the ICW and UK Ministry of Magic to go out and fight him without a deal where Grindelwald would still be available to him on an ongoing basis for... well, certain sexual practices just shouldn't be discussed on a non-NSFW subreddit. Suffice it to say, though, you probably don't want to know.

Grindelfilch, poor thing, doesn't even remember what happens after their weekly assignations.

And yes, I agree, this is very, very awful of Dumbledore. Kind of changes your whole view of his character, doesn't it?

** Not an especially unusual name for a cat. I used to know an old lady with a cat named Commander James, named after her husband. Cat was super chill, lady was a bit craycray.

** So, there are two straight up squibs we know of in the series: Mrs. Figg and Filch. Both are obsessed with cats (Figg with quantity, Filch with specificity). COINCIDENCE? Probably, but that's boring and therefore I shall assume there is a connection.

I believe it is canon that Mrs. Figg's cats are part kneazles, and therefore more intelligent than the average cat. Mrs. Norris is clearly far more intelligent than a normal/muggle cat (and seems to be more intelligent than any of Figg's hybrids), and is therefore presumably more than half-kneazle. However, this explanation is boring, and therefore I'm ignoring it.

Squibs don't actually lack magic. However, their magic can ONLY manifest by increasing the intelligence of felines. This is why Filch is truly angered at the thought of a dead Mrs. Norris, his only true magic has been robbed from him. This also explains why Mrs. Norris is so much smarter than Figg's cats. Filch's magic is focused on only one feline, while Figg's is spread apart into a network of cats.

This information is kept classified by the Department of Mysteries, who is trying to recruit all Squibs to create a Spying Network called /Operation: Squibcat/ to further their plans, which uses the Rotfang Conspiracy as a front for the true power in the Department of Mysteries: The Knights of Walpurgis. It's not Love in the locked room, but SQUIBCAT CONTROL CENTER (SCC).

So then, why is Crookshanks so damn intelligent? Because she isn't Hermione's cat, but a Squib's planted spy as part of Operation: Squibcat to keep an eye on The Boy Who Lived, Dumbledore /and/ Argus Filch (whom many in SCC are beginning to mistakenly suspect is a double agent for the International Confederation of Warlocks after not getting any intelligence from unit mrsNORris, when in reality Filch was just embarrassed that he let his cat get petrified).

Beware a Squib with cats if ye have a secret to keep.

** She is Filch's lover who was turned into a cat by another person who loved her in order to spite her and Filch. That is why Filch is so bitter and why he seems to hate people who actually have access to magic. This also explains what Mrs Norris is so devoted to Filch and so intelligent and why she is capable of far more than an ordinary cat should be capable of.

Cats don't seem to care one way or another what you name them, so why not have fun with it?

** ... I had a cat named KilKenny Starfighter, after the beer and the main chatacter of a Swedish satirical Sci-Fi series respectively (not even joking, we called him Kenny for short though, which makes the whole thing even more stupid). So I'd say Filch's more sane than I am with the naming conventions.
