Basically, it's a good old-fashioned murder mystery going down in Hogwarts, and it's up to +Scooby and the Gang+ I mean Harry and company to find the culprit and bring them to justice before the Ministry of Magic does something monumentally stupid, like close the school. I leave it up to any prospective authors to pick what year it happens in, but I was initially thinking of having it take place in an alternate Year 5, just for the added complication in the form of Dolores Umbridge.


** Huh.. litterally 3/4ths (or more) of the school would be suspects.. plot twist, turns out it was Dumbledore, he just couldnt stand the little rasist shit anymore, and just snapped xD
