[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12627805/1/The-Bat-and-The-Phoenix][A fanfiction where Bruce Wayne adopts Harry Potter]]

Feedback is appreciated in the form of reviews or on here.


** Alright. Two things. One, technically good so far, if the characters werent completely fleshed out yet.

Two, you had solid reasoning for what happening happening except the adoption. Bruce just met Harry. In Canon it took Bruce months to decided to adopt Dick. A little unbelievable there. Also, put a little more care into the action scenes as for batman a ton of who he is, and how he acts is conveyed via the fight. Also minor character issue for dick. His age matters alot. He was and is the longest robin to date, with experts stating that he was robin from when he was 11 or 12 until he was in his mid twenties. (for reference Jason was 15-19, Tim Drake 13-21ish and Damien from age 13-to current) i bring this up because that large age range changes Dick more than any other Robin. He goes from an avenging eager child to a crime fighter who takes Batman's word as law, to an angry, upset teen who is trying to find himself out of Batman's shadow, until he grows into a hero who is on par, by Bruce's and Superman's admission to Batman. When Dick is an adult, he is arguably the best member of the batfamily due to this character journey. And depending on where he is, he can connect and balance Harry more or less.

I hope this helped.

*** I honestly wasn't expecting this to get any feedback, so thank you.

About the adoption, I know it was a little rushed so I'll try to explain in story reasons of why that could be. Firstly, like you said, Bruce has already adopted Dick and seen the benefits this bright for both Bruce and Duck, which contributed to him taking Harry. Bruce had also picked up how Harry felt about the Dursleys based upon Harry's actions and quietness, so Bruce was eager to give him a good home life. Finally, Bruce is likely blame himself for being too slow which resulted in the Dursleys dying and Harry re-becoming an orphan. All of this, along with Bruce already knowing that Harry's parents are dead, resulted in Bruce making the rash decision to make the adoption.

Action and fighting scenes are, admittedly, my weak point so I'm trying to improve them. Have you any suggestions for how you would make them better?

With Dick's age, I am taking a bit of artistic licence, from a combination of different universes and medias. For example in the new 52, Dick is only Batman's sidekick for a year before he leaves to create the Teen Titans. Admittedly, I think I will bump his age up from stated so it resembles an existing continuity.

Thanks for the feedback.

**** To answer your fighting scene question, in my experience there are three ways of going through a fighting scene in literature.

The first is to create a mental picture, and "play" through the scene. This is great for individual fights, where you can pick out details, to add realism. This is good for methodical writers, who plan out every single scene. in this way, every action the characters do matter, and the reader knows this.

Another is big flashy, and detail driven fights. These are fights from authors such as Kenshi, KingKakashi and others. These are the fights where the battle isn't won via a step by step plan but reaction to the actions, or the preparedness of the warriors for each scenario. These are perfect for /Character/ driven stories.

Finally there is the Combat that is based solely on story. I avoid this if possible, as the point of a fight is not to be there just for the story. For example, if your harry potter is a slytherin who avoids combat if possible, fighting would not work. However I have read countless stories where Harry fights because the original story has him fighting there. DO NOT MAKE YOUR CHARACTERS FIGHT FOR NO REASON.

Now, that we have covered the "ways" here is the how. Do not tell the readers what each fighter is doing, show it so that they INFER IT. EXAMPLE

#+begin_quote
  Harry's eyes widened as the green light erupted from Voldemort's wand. Voldemort's eyes shone in sadistic glee as the curse raced for the downed Boy-Who-Lived. The green jet splashed against the tiled floor, cracking it. Voldemort glared as the boy got up shakily from where he was Summoned. "Dumbledore..."
#+end_quote

See the difference there? in four sentences I outlined what happened, marked Dumbledore's arrival and showcased that in this instance, Harry lost. However, not once did I have dialogue other than Voldemort saying Dumbledore's name. Not once did I have an action be useless, nor did I put more detail than necessary to outline what was going on. That is showing not telling. The difference is how the reader loses themselves in the scene.

Most importantly, stay in character during fight scenes. I see this in DC, Harry Potter, and Naruto fanfiction all the time. You go through 30k words building up this character's personality, and in a fight, s/he reacts totally out of character. A stonic Naruto, who is cool under pressure, will not lash out in anger at Gaara about to kill Sakura. Bruce, fighting Joker, would NEVER allow him a moment to get up. He has seen Joker kill to many people, and would end the threat immediately.

Those are the tips I can give you. Other authors may have more advice, and it would probably be better. I hope this helps.

Capital letters!

Anyway, Dick's "robining" years change with each universe, not to mention DC making a mess with chronology adjustments. Pre-Flashpoint it was 12-19 according to Chris Miller (Unauthorized Chronology of the DC Universe), 12-16 according to Collin Colsher (The Real Batman Chronology) and in Collin Colsher's approximation of official DC timeline it was 12-17. He is older when he starts in New 52 era (if you want I can find necessary informations to figure how long he was Robin here). And who knows how old this went now, with Rebirth changing continuity by chunks (which I trully hate, give me clear before/after line for continuity changes).

  Damien from age 13-to current
#+end_quote

It's Dami*a*n, why the hell so many people can't get this easy name straight. Anyway, the issue of Damian's age is pretty big, especially in New 52.

**** Im not as familiar with DC as I want to be, however my points still stand. The timeline for Dick matters and that was the point.

***** I don't want to invalidate your point, I'm just obsessed with a matters of Big Two comic book chronologies (well, I'm obsessed with chronologies and canon details in general).
