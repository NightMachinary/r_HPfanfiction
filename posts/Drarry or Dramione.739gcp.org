** Neither works without at least one character being drastically different, so I generally avoid both of them.

** I really enjoy both, Drarry being the first fanfiction I accidentally stumbled upon back in the day. But now if I had to choose I would pick Dramione, because I really do feel it wasn't outside the realm of possibility if Draco had been given a redemption arc like many feel he deserved. He also seemed like someone that would value Hermione's intelligence and quirks rather than be annoyed by them since he was also quite intelligent. It would be the ultimate proof of his being redeemed as well both in his beliefs and making right the bullying he did in the past by altering the status quo. I have a lot of feelings on this topic, clearly. XD

** Drarry. Draco is so racist that I can't see Hermione being with him unless he's totally different or if she has no self respect. Harry, however, wasn't really on the receiving end of his racism. I've seen it happen in real life, where someone is fine dating someone else who was racist to one of their friends because witnessing racism isn't the same as experiencing it. On the other hand, unless the person who is a minority has terrible self esteem and some major self loathing going on, they're not likely to date someone so blatantly racist to them.

*** Oh for both Drarry and Dramione I can't see it at all unless Draco has matured and gotten past his bigoted beliefs. So its more which ship you prefer under that assumption which isn't a uncommon one in fanfiction.

**** I agree Draco would have to change a lot for either of them to date him, but I think Harry would have an easier time forgiving Draco his bigoted past than Hermione would since she was more his victim than Harry was.

***** I'll agree to that to a degree its true that he picked on Harry too but it was more out of jealousy and pettyness which doesn't make it better but there is less uncomfortableness to get past since he at least still saw Harry as a equal a rival. While he saw Hermione is as something beneath him because of what she was. I am all about kids who grew up with bigoted parents learning that those bigoted views are wrong and getting past them but it seems uncomfortable when the victim of their bigotry has to get them past it before starting a relationship. Dramione i prefer in AUs where Draco was never a bigot or one of those years after the war ones where hes gotten past alot of his issues.

** From a plausibility standpoint, Dramione.

Ignoring the canon sexual orientations of the characters concerned, Draco and Harry are enemies because Draco reminds Harry of Dudley, a spoiled bully. That's not a basis for sexual chemistry.

It's not like there's a lot to attract Hermione to Draco, either, but she has been shown to be more open than Harry to going out with someone she dislikes (McLaggen), and at the beginning of Book Two when we overhear Draco's conversation with his father, it sounds as if Draco has been bringing up Hermione all summer.

*** Well true but it is indicated that he's been bringing up Harry too. I mean how else would Dobby know what Harry did his first year. But i definitely agree with you on the Dudley parallel part .
