I've just finished re-reading the Harry Potter books and I don't want to magic to end. I'm looking for a story that appears canon, that fills the gap between the end of the war and the end of the book. Ideally from Harry's point of view. Thanks.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3682339/1/The-Golden-Age][The Golden Age]] by Arsinoe de Blassenville is pretty damn good, but it's not a "happily ever after" story. In fact, I found it rather depressing, but believable.

*** Seconding this--a great story, though one that puts on display much of the fridge horror of the series. It was written in a pique of disaffection with the final book in the series.

*** Just started it and I must say, the characterisation of Harry is pretty on-point and also refreshingly different from a lot of the post-Hogwarts carefree Harry fics I've read. Like you said the story is quite believable.

**** Hmmm quite depressing yes. I can't help it, I'm a "all was well" person but it was interesting. I'm not sure I liked the portrayal of Hermione's character I don't think she's THAT power hungry. And she loved Ron for years yes JK said they may need marriage counselling, but that would suggest they would want to at least try and make it work. And then (wishful thinking) they'd be stronger than ever. I don't like it but i do think Harry and Ginny's story is quite believable other there are many other out comes that would be just as believeable a and you know happier lol. Thanks for the read through I would actually recommend it !

** If you need something happier than de Blassenville you want [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]] and maybe [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4367121/1/The-First-Day][little0bird]].

If you're enjoying the darkness try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5533537/1/Four-o-clock-in-the-morning][Vera Rozalsky]] (Her /Amends/ story is even darker, but still in-progress.)

One of the first fan fictions I read. It is angsty, it is realistic, it will make you cry.
