the only solution i have right now is HUGE things that change permanently--Harry casting fiendfyre in Vulcan's Forge--or full sensory changing events: i.e., a muggle or muggleborn temporarily transfigured into a cat or something.


** They would probably treat it like the Batazoids. Deanna Troi's abilities might as well be magic to us, but the canon has some techno-babble that explains it away.

The Wizarding world is it's own separate culture but it does keep pace in some fashion with muggle advancements. The Ministry has Cars and so forth. I figure by the time that ST is set they would explain things to muggleborns through a "sciency" perspective. They would explain that Wizards can ignore most of known physics with the use of a (perhaps definable) power(energy) they call magic. They use instruments that resonate with the same or similar energy to focus this ability.

It wouldn't be treated as /magical/, but a rather rare trait that needs to be trained.

#+begin_quote
  When Harry Potter is rescued from a planet he spent centuries on alone, he's happy to find his kind still exist on their new world but he exiles himself amongst the muggles of the Federation, hunting for something. Then when his one friend amongst them is murdered, Harry contacts the one group that knows of his abilities and offers his help. For a price.

** It kinda depends on how you're treating magic in a Star Trek world- does what they do show up on a Federation sensor in some way?

Is magic truly magical or are the wizards ascribing a metaphysical importance to a collection of psionic capabilities?

*** Yes, magicals call it octarine, muggles call it orthogonal radiation and it's linked to some areas of earth where the mythical ley lines converge. Orthogonal radiation does not play well with solid state crystal based tech. Orthogonal radiation does not play well with genetic engineering/testing in the story either.

Magical but they're beginning to study alien cultures in hopes of findi more magicals and studying those psionic abilities of others but find vulcans and betazoids don't produce octarine like they do.

**** I guess then it rather depends on how much the wizards actually know this. If they do magic by instinct and ritual, their approach would be 'careful and cautious'.

Ensigns Gary and Udotra Harcourt were sitting down for a dinner with their daughter Madeline when someone literally 'knocked' on the door to their quarters.

Udotra was closer, so she stood from the table and called 'enter', prompting a yelp of surprise and delight from their visitor- a rather strangely-dressed human from the planet below. He entered, turning in place to watch the doors close again before turning back to the family.

"Oh, hello! Some lovely automation you have. Allow me to introduce myself; I'm Professor Aristotle Brambleditch."

Gary stood as well and tapped his communicator. "Intruder alert on deck twelve." Strangely, no response came from his badge nor from the computer panel.

"Now, now. I wouldn't want us to be interrupted. It's just that we've a certain talent for... eh... 'bending the rules' of reality and we keep an eye out for others with that potential. Our devices noticed that your daughter is one. Like us. As the timing is right, I've come to offer her a place with us, to learn how to do what we do. It's really the responsible thing to do. Oh- is that Chicken Marsala? I love a good wine sauce." The professor pulled a stick of wood from the layers of robes and a moment later an entire place setting with a full plate of the same food was arranged for him.

"Sir, I am going to have to ask you to leave!"

"Really? That's unfortunate. I was looking forward to a lovely conversation."

The man then disappeared with a 'pop'. Left behind in his wake was a hand-written letter on parchment, addressed to their daughter.
