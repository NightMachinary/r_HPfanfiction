It's a series of connected mini fics, Fem!Harry (Victoria or Vivienne or some other V name I think?) Is married to Loki as Goddess of Vengeance.

She finds out that Loki caused the events of Avengers before the alien invasion and comes to drag him back to Asgard by his ear after kicking his ass 6 ways to Sunday.

It was more humor than serious. Please and thank you.


** The story has apparently been deleted. It was [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/10014934/1/][Hell Hath no Fury]] By [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4561396/VivyPotter][VivyPotter]].

I'll try to find a backup. I might even have it in my personal ebook library.

Edit: Not in my library. ):

*** Are you perhaps thinking of Hell Hath no fury linkffn ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10203356/1/]]) by Marion Hood? That one's Hermione not fem!Harry, but otherwise exactly what you described.

**** No. Hell Hath no Fury by VivyPotter had a series of small one shots of a Viviane Potter that ended up in Asgard, Loki and her fell in love, got married, Odin gave her the mantle of Goddess of Vengeance. Then the titular story(those story elements came from one shots written afterwords as prequels) had the scene where Loki was trapped in the hulk containment room on the helicarrier. Loki was being super smug, and then a portal formed in from of Fury and everyone. Thor knew instantly what was happening, and "A lady dressed in the armor of Asgard" stepped through. Then she yelled out asking where her husband was. Thor tried to placate her with compliments, saying she was looking lovely, She got annoyed and started stomping off to look for Loki. The story ended with her walking into the room, Loki wimpering because he could feel her magic comic, he tried to placate her with sweet statements. Nick Fury specifically sat outside the room and listened, saying something along the lines, oh, that'll only work if she's a certain type. Then Loki Screamed and Fury said she was a demon type. Then one of the others, clint maybe? asked Thor what she was the goddess of. Thor then said she was the Goddess of Vengeance.

Oh, I kind of remember Fem!Harry yelling out "80 people in 2 days!" like 2-3 times.
