At the end of either secind or probably first year Harry is pretty much adopted by the Gryffyindor quidditch team + Percy as their little brother. Over the summer they visit him and I think he goes to an amusment park with the chasers and maybe Oliver?

Thanks in advance.

  In the books, Harry's been betrayed by his house so many times it's never a surprise. But what if the Gryffindors got their act together after Harry's first year and start acting like a family again? The result is Lion Unity, where wizards and witches all over the world learn not to mess with Harry and his huge family.
