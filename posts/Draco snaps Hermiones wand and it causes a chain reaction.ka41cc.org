So i cant remember all the details , but i think it started with Ron arguing with Hermione that caused Draco to come over insult her and snap her wand. This triggers some custom with the Malfoys having to look after her as it damages her magical core and in questioning why this is happening, the Malfoys expected hwe to be having magical culture lessons. I cant remember any other details

#+begin_quote
  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
