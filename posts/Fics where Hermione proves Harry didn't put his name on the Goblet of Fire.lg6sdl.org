Any fics where Hermione proves anyone can actually put their name in the goblet if you think hard enough?

I read one fanfic where Hermione proved it was possible when she tossed a paper ball and thrown it into the goblet like shooting a basketball into the basketball hoop (I forgot the title and author though).

Anyone knows fics like this one? Thanks!
