For me, it is usually blatant character bashing. I'm sure a common answer will be not having our desired romantic pairing as well.

When one of your turn-offs appears in a fic, does it make you stop reading immediately or will you continue and just roll your eyes? Something else entirely?


** On fanfiction.net, I won't even open a fic if, in the summary, the author says "I suck at writing summaries." You are not exactly instilling me with confidence, Author. Maybe you suck at writing stories, too?

*** Bad dialogue sticks out so much! I think it's one of the more difficult things to write though, not just finding the right cadence and vocabulary, but because it's easy to get trapped in writing dialogue like how we ourselves would speak and everyone's dialogue ends up sounding like the same voice.

** This might be rude (and a certain statement by Dumbledore comes to mind), but I can't stand bad writing. And I don't just mean spelling and grammar, but actual bad writing. Some of the fics I read make it seem like the author never read them back to themselves. Personally, I think that one should always read anything they've written out-loud to themselves. It helps you catch all kinds of things. But yeah, nothing turns me off to a fic faster than if it has bad flow or clunky vernacular.

** Fandom gets kind of overly comfortable with itself sometimes, especially with one as large as HP. Certain characterizations have trended that they almost seem canon after reading so many fics like that, but there's also a staleness to them as well. I'm always turned off by stock phrases and description that pop up when introducing characters, and it makes them instantly seem more one-dimensional. Kind of like pining James, perfect Lily, quiet Remus, etc. as an example.

Also in general, unnecessary spirals of angst. Good angst is good, but bad angst is often very, very bad and shoved in.

** "I've been used!" Harry and the Passive Agressive Bad Headmaster.

I seriously hate this plotline. So much wangsting and so little resistance are not the hallmarks of a well-executed manipulation plot. So many coincidental happenings would have been noticed and countered. Molly Weasley is a housewife and mother of seven, not someone capable of outsmarting seasoned veterans in the arenas of politics and warfare.

And a master manipulator being so blatant is not a plot point, it's a failure of the author's imagination.

If you're going to bash the dude and label him as the Dark Lord in waiting, make him capable of performing such acts. I.e. he does not take shit from a bunch of teenagers if he's spent the better part of a century being Evil and getting away with it.

He does not roll over and die when confronted with his shortcomings.

He does not try and endear himself with a boy he can enslave with the flick of a wand.

He does not lose control of his political offices because Skeeter publishes something.

And, above all that is holy, he does not leave his dealings with other species to chance. Read that, if he wants the wills sealed, then he'll make damn sure that the Potter-sympathetic Goblins aren't alive to open it any more.

In canon, he's a leader twice over, a war veteran /sans pareil/, in control of two deathly hallows for over a decade and an astute politician with fifty years served in the highest offices his world can throw at him.

If he's evil, with these qualifications, you make him /fucking evil/.

Oh, and in the 'I make Hitler and Stalin look like human rights activists' sense, not in the 'I am the reincarnation of Dick Dastardly' manner that you will find in /partially kissed Hero/ which, even though Dumbles is moderately competent and pretty evil, is still far too camp and incompetent in his evil-ness to actually make for a credible threat. Though the fic itself is pretty trippy... Nonetheless, bad means bad and should be written that way.

Another peeve is extreme character changes. I have no problem with different behaviors if a) The author creates situations/plots that can explain them. b) Parodies.

Other way around too, if there's no real conflict and everyone's happy, that's equally boring. That can only really work in a comedy, but I don't usually read comedies.

Characters too OOC without proper buildup. Snape and Draco are especially guilty of this.

"For the greater good" Dumbledore. Dumbledore had a slightly manipulative streak to him. He was /not/ Kira. There have been fics I've liked with this (Bungle in the Jungle and the sequel), but I didn't like that aspect and I only stuck with it because jbern's other stuff is great.

** Wizards having a depletable source of magic is a real hate I have. Unfortunately, a large number of fanfics write HP magic like this. Damn you RPGs and MP.

Harry - or anyone else - going on about the virtues of Muggles compared to wizards, or the superiority of Muggle technology.

Stupid or unnecessarily changes to the magic system.

Badly written Dumbledore - includes almost all manipulative Dumbledore.

Abbreviations like Dumbles, Voldie, etc.

Characters professing "I've loved you for years!". Especially if they do this right at the beginning of a relationship.

Antagonists detailing all their plans to an empty room, that the reader happens to have a view into, and then letting off an evil laugh.

Voldemort written as completely inept and constantly torturing his own followers.

Voldemort owning a throne.

Stupid Death Eater attacks on Diagon Alley, Hogsmede, etc. that have no strategic purpose.

Character bashing.

And much much more.

** In the summary, I won't even bother to click if it says "What if..." They're usually poorly written stories with outrageous plot lines that don't make sense. Like "What if Harry was really a double agent?" "What if after James and Lily's death, Peter wasn't successful in framing Sirius?" "What if Harry was taken from the doorstep that night the Dark Lord fell what would happan if the Evans never died out?" To me, it demonstrates poor writing skill. One could easily just take out the "What if" and make a normal sentence.

Also I hate excessive swearing, it does not make you sound like a cool teenager to use fuck every other word, in real life and in writing. Angsty fics that just sound whiny, like: "ooooh my life is so hard because this one boy doesn't notice me, I'm suddenly a cutter and a Death Eater to deal with my pain. Americanisms, poor dialogue, shitty formatting, spelling errors.

Just bad writing in general makes me cringe. It's part of the reason I shy away from FanFiction.net and go on the moderated sites.

***** Try Vekin87's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4380964/1/Albus_Potter_and_the_Dungeon_of_Merlins_Mist][Albus Potter]] series. There are several OCs, but all of them are pretty good.

***** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Boy_Who_Lived][Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived]] features quite a few OCs, and is absolutely fantastic. The story features Harry in Durmstrang, and despite a lot of the pitfalls you'd expect (Harry has a twin, the second most important character is an OC, not in Hogwarts, bit of a silly name for a fanfic in my opinion), it's one of the better fanfics I've read, and I've read a ton.

Do note that it hasn't been updated on ff for a while, but there have been a ton of updates on the WbA section on the DLP forums.

** Bad grammar, I hate bad grammar in a fic. It makes me stop reading right away. I don't mean like a grammar mistake now and then, like when its very common and its throughout the fic.

** I will give you my list, then explanations (For those of you who don't just skim through things) will be at the bottom.

I hate:

1. Bad Writing

2. Making it into anime

3. Making your original character be the center of everything

4. Falling in love after two days

5. Having the first kiss lead right into a sex scene, unless it's daterape or they're drunk or there's some sort of plot point to this

6. Having cliche sex, or not knowing much about sex.

7. Lack of character flaw

8. Pedophilia

Alright, now for the long explanation.

1) I would rather read a story with good, flowing writing and no plot or a bad plot than I would read a story with amazing plot and bad writing.

2)Now don't get me wrong, I do like to watch anime. However, if you are going to make Harry Potter out to be an anime then draw it. I do not want to read "His eyes shine mysteriously" or have the characters input random Japanese words like "Kawaii" or "Mione-chan" into their dialogue. The characters, and story is British. I understand that you are super proud for knowing all of ten Japanese words, but it just doesn't fit at all. If you want your characters to randomly be chibi or have their hair flow all over the place then draw a comic.

3) Original characters can be really interesting. It is really impressive to get an HP fanbase to want your original character to mate with one of JK Rowling's creations. HOWEVER, you do not get to make your character the only one who can defeat Voldemort, nor can you make them the cousin of Dumbledore and the Daughter of Voldemort, and also Lily's half sister. No they cannot be an angel or a vampire, no they cannot be "The Girl the Also Lived."

4) I do not care who you are, but unless you are seriously crazy, drunk, or in a very odd situation you will not agree to marry someone after knowing them for all of three days. I don't care if you make the characters slutty and have them have sex the first time they meet, but throw love in there and I will not believe you. EVER.

5) This sort of goes along with number four... If you are trying to have the whole "they've known each other for so LONG" thing go on, it does not mean that the first time they kiss they are just going to go have full on sex. Usually people are daunted by the first kiss enough for it to be a big deal. If there is rape or alcohol/drugs involved then whatever, but I'm sorry. When Draco randomly kisses Harry they are not just going to have sex. A character quick to have sex must have that as a character trait rather than just because. An innocent character like Lily is not going to fuck James the first time she kisses him. JUST NO.

6) This is more for all those young writers who have never experienced sex/watched porn. IF YOU ARE GOING TO WRITE A SEX SCENE DO RESEARCH. I'm not kidding. I have had a bit of sex but never EVER has someone gone down on me for two hours followed by an hour of intercourse. Know what feels good, only then will your audience get into the scene. Also never use the word "manhood" ever. It's just not allowed. If you want to make the scene romantic and not raunchy (or if you just don't want to say "cock, penis, or dick") then say "he thrusts HIMSELF into her" or "she could feel HIM deep within her." Not only does this get rid of silly words, but this also makes the genitalia less of a separate object, and you are "joining" the characters through sex. They are becoming "one." Let's just compare for a second. Bad example: Draco's manhood became stiff as Luna's tongue slid along its base. She continued up to swallow the manhood whole. Good example: Draco became stiff as Luna's tongue slid along his base. She continued up to swallow Draco whole.

7) To make an interesting fanfiction, there must be inward and outward obstacles. You cannot have characters just "fit" together. They both need to make mistakes, and have faults. The reason we love Harry Potter so much is because each character has their own faults. In having flaws you can grow and learn to make up for them. A progression in a character's core values or reasoning usually means they are more effectively able to have relationships with other people. The "Oh well he's a prince and I'm a pesant" story can only be used so many times before it gets boring. If a writer adds internal conflict it becomes more interesting. What if the Prince is to marry someone from another kingdom in an arranged marriage. One that will save the economy of his country, and save his people from starvation. Well that's more interesting. Now make the prince a man who is sworn to duty. He has grown up his entire life as a prince and has been trained to ALWAYS put the good of his people before his own desires. But he meets his first love after he gets married. She is a pesant, a gypsy. He must battle between what he has always learned to do and his first experience with real temptation. What about this pesant girl though? It's boring if she is just a lover and perfect, then the prince is the only one with conflict. That's not true in real life though, every person has internal conflict. So what can we add to the pesant? Well she is one of the people saved from starvation due to the marriage of the two kindoms. So surely she understands the importance of the prince's marriage. Now further, what if the kingdom that was rich was also oppressive of their people, having strict laws that the people of the poor country didn't believe in. Conflict makes things exciting.

8) Last but not least. Since I am tired of writing, let me explain in layman's terms. Harry x Sirius = Not okay. Hermione x Snape = Not okay. Harry x Hermione = okay. Sirius x Snape = Okay. I'm willing to do Fred and George together, I can stand breaking the incest line. But no I don't want to read about Dumbledore's wrinkly balls being licked by a fifteen year old Hermione.

** Non-canon stuff. Both plot and character.

Obviously, when I know it isn't canon from the get it doesn't have the same negative effect and there are a lot of old fics that are grandfathered in due to new info coming out but when I see a fic published in the post-DH era with inaccuracies so outrageous that it may as well be AU, I just lose interest.

**** I don't like fanfiction where the canon-story is replaced. I want continuation or expansion on the series not a complete deviation with new characters wearing the real characters names. Anything that couldn't happen within JK's series is not interesting to me because it isn't part of the story and never can be.

** *Things that make me stop reading immediately:*

- Harry/Hermione.

- Poor grammar, sentence structure, doesn't know what a paragraph is.

- Terrible writing, I mean, come on...

- Dialogue and even /actions/ of the characters that is compleeeetely out of character.

- Shitty dialogue like:

  Hermione ran into the bathroom and hid in a stall.

"Hermione," said Harry, "Will you please come out and talk to me?"

"No."

"Please?"

"No!"

"Please?"

"NO!"

"Please Hermione, we're best friends."

"Okay," Hermione sighed as she unlocked the stall door.

*Things I'll read because I've already invested some time into the story but go "ugh" a lot:*

- Ron/Hermione in awful and out of character storylines because R/Hr is all I read. :x

- Really bad plot lines involving ridiculous scenarios. Like Hermione's a slutbag and is banging all the boys in the fifth year, woo.

- Song fics, these are just so.../lame/ in my mind.

- Any fic written after GoF that has /another/ Yule Ball, regardless that it's a traditional dance meant to encourage inter-school relations during the /Tri-Wizard Tournament/. Or a graduation ball. Or an Autumn Fling. Or any other sort of stupid dance scene just because they want to live out their fantasy proms!!

** 1. Fucking hate Ginny. If a story even remotely has her in it, I will not read it.
2. Original Characters, if I wanted to read a story about people outside of the HP universe, i wouldn't be looking for HP fanfiction!

** Slash- it just seems so gratuitous.

Overpowered characters- it CAN be done well, especially if there's a justification, but it usually just turns into "Harry starts his own Dueling Club and can take out a dozen Death Eaters with wandless, silent Stunners in 5 seconds."
