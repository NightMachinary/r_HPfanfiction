  Meeting in dreams, Severus and Harry formed a friendship that would span across the years. When they figure out who the other truly is, how will this affect their relationship and the end of the war? Cannon compliant until 5th yr. Time-travelish.

**** Fair enough. I couldn't live with myself if it was and I didnt send you the link just cause I wasnt sure. Another one that sounds similar, but is with bellatrix, is linkffn(Passageways) but they're both in hogwarts there, so again probably not
