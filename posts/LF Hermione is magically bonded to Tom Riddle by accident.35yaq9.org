I remember reading this awhile back, but now I can't find it anymore.

It's a Hermione/Tom Riddle pairing. Hermione and Tom were somehow magically bonded/attached. There was this scene where Dumbledore was testing how far apart they could go, so Hermione and Riddle started walking in opposite directions until they couldn't bear it anymore and ran back to each other like magnets.

Anyone know which fic I'm talking about?

EDIT: Downvoted? What did I do? Did I break a rule or something?


** You didn't break a rule. Some +people are just salty+ subscribers are /so/ not into certain things that they just downvote on impulse. A couple probably jumped to conclusions, thinking that you were requesting any fic that fit the mould.

*** Thanks. I got a little worried when I saw it was at 0 points earlier. I thought I had broken some unspoken rule or something.

** Not exactly the same thing, but has similar themes "Ultimata Ratio" by Winterblume is my favorite Tomione fic.

** Oh this was not Tom riddle, this was Draco and Hermione and it was called The Unseemly Proposal.

Unless you are talking about "Have You Ever" but that did not feature a link per se.

*** Hmm... maybe you're right, though I can't seem to find that scene in The Unseemly Proposal (I have to admit, I only skimmed up to chapter 18).

I don't read Draco/Hermione, that's why I'm not 100% sure that this was the fanfic I was looking for. Then again, my memory's pretty shoddy these days. Who knows, maybe I did read that on a whim and were remembering it wrong now.

** The fic you're looking for might be /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8732231/1/The-Task][The Task]]/ by ImmortalObsession, or /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3736817/3/Masters-of-Manipulation][Masters of Manipulation]]/ by Nerys.

I know which fic you're talking about, but I just can't remember the name of it.

*** Thank you. I'm reading both fics now, though so far, it doesn't seem to be the one I'm looking for. Then again, I'm only on chapters 10 & 12, so I could be wrong.

But I'm glad you've read the one I was looking for, too. I thought I was going crazy there or remembering it wrong somehow.

**** You're not wrong! It's just hard to shift through so many Tomione fics, when it's a specific one. I know it exists, it's just been a while since I read it.
