One of my favorite Star Wars EU series has Admiral Thrawn as the antagonist. Spoiler, he's not force sensitive. He's simply a strategic and tactical genius.

So I'm looking for any fic where a non-magical person holds a significant seat of power. Ant/protagonist doesn't matter.


** A squib plays a crucial role in training one of the protagonists in the OC-centric story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3353818/1/Shade-to-Shade][Shade to Shade]].

And a Muggle is a pretty formidable villain in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12631584/1/Driving-Miss-Weasley][Driving Miss Weasley.]]

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12212363/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Iron-Lady][Harry Potter and The Iron Lady]] by mugglesftw kind of qualifies - Maggie Thatcher is in the know about magic, and an OC Muggle family raises Harry.

  Even muggles notice thousands dead, and Margaret Thatcher had the help of one Sergeant Prewett of Her Majesty's Special Air Service. Harry Potter is taken in by a loving family, and raised to become the hero of both worlds. Even as he enters Hogwarts looking for friends, he is confronted by the darkness in the wizarding world. Now complete! Sequel: Nymphadora Tonks: The Last Auror.

** Okay, so there's a squib terrorist organization called the sandbloods in Linkffn(Albus Potter and the global revelation) and a terrorist organization has to have some kind of evil mastermind running things, but it's been a long time and I don't remember.

I think I got "caught up" at one point and then just never went back to the updates

  *SERIES COMPLETE!* Book 1/7. Structured like original HP books. Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all. COMPLETE!

** Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach)

Harry accidentally flies past a camera, the entire world sees the footage, secrecy is over and the world is in chaos. Includes a lot of politicking between President Clinton, his secretary of magic, the British minister for magic, Saudi Arabias King Fahd (under the Imperius), Kim Jong-Il, Osama Bin Laden, Voldemort (who manages to take over some countries), and the politicians of the hidden magical nations like Syrdan.

  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?
