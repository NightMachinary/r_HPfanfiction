I'm going to preface this with a disclaimer that I'm not even remotely an expert in these fields of science. If I'm getting something wrong, please correct me so I know for the future. Having said that, let's continue.

I've seen the muggle vs wizard debate in many places, and both sides have some good points. I have two points to consider; nuclear bombs, and thermal imaging.

One thing the pro-muggle arguers often bring up is the nuke. Everyone loves the nuke. And until recently I agreed that wizards might be able to stop the explosion, but they wouldn't be able to do anything about the radiation. And then I saw the argument right next to someone talking about the disillusionment charm and that was enough to make a connection.

So the disillusionment charm works by taking light, bending it around someone, and then continuing it on its previous course. Gamma radiation is just light but with more energy, so it should be a simple matter to cast the 'radiation diversion' charm and be perfectly safe.

Thermal imaging works by either picking up infrared radiation produced by warm bodies, or lighting something up with an infrared light. And infrared is just light but with less energy, also divertable. In fact, if disillusionment works by 'stoping something from being perceivable' it probably already affects infrared and ultraviolet light anyway (and probably sonar) The only question is wether there's a charm that can stop something from producing light (and other radiation).

So yeah. Those are my thoughts in a weird ramble. I'm interested in talking about it with others.

Cheers. :)

This seems to be contradicted by canon. Magic in canon is conceptual. A killing curse kills (without a mechanism explainable by muggle forensic science), a fidelius is the storage of a secret in a soul, and love is a force of nature, not a biochemical phenomenon. The disillusionment charm hides things (Hermione casts it on their camp in DH). This is probably conceptual. A worse disillusionment charm might not be as good as one cast by Dumbledore, but it hides someone.

Magic overrides mundane nature. What I think would happen is that the light would simply be changed by the charm to be what is needed to hide the disillusioned object or person. This would be similar to how the unplottable charm means that a place becomes untraceable. Magic isn't limited by physical laws.

  /Just as wizards can make buildings unplottable, they can also make themselves untraceable. Voldemort would have been found long ago if it had been as simple as sending him an owl!/

To protect against radiation, I'd be willing to bet a wizard could also cast an imperturbable or impervious charm. I'm not even sure they'd need to, however. Wizards possess great physical resiliency and resistance to toxins.

Edit: To add my thoughts on wizards vs muggles. First of all, wizards literally control the phone calls of the prime minister of the UK. They've won already from that.

Wizards can also conjure matter and override nature. Wizards can control minds, become untraceable, and kill with a thought. An imperturbable charm repels objects, a shield charm protects against harm, and wizards can also just teleport. Wizards can set up nation-wide surveillance systems, repel muggles from an area, transfigure objects in an area (age line), and wipe memories. Wizards have access to mandrakes and Nundu's breath (potent bioweapon) that can kill wizards, to say the least of muggles who can't even mend bones in an instant and can't even cure mundane illnesses (pepper-up for the cold anyone?).

Edit 2: Read through the science, instead of just skimming over it. Alpha particles and beta particles have mass and are also ionizing particles that are harmful, though they do have less penetrating power. Still though, a good shield or impervious charm and wizards would be fine.

*** Ah yeah, I definitely need to keep in mind the /magic/ part of magic, rather than the science part, haha.

And I definitely agree with you, although I don't know many stories like this. (Other than those two or three popular ones which I have read)

**** Yeah, I think a good test for good fanfiction is a magic system that mirrors or is similar to canon. It usually shows that the authors thought through Harry Potter instead of just thinking that they could do better.

** Wizards don't live in a seperate country, they live among muggles. I don't know how can you nuke Diagon Alley or Ministry without wiping out London?

And wizards can control minds with imperius and so they can access every muggle weapons.

And coming your disillusionment charm, I think simple thermal imaging will work. Even if it did, they can essily change body temps.

** One thing that sometimes fails to come up is the respective war readiness and 'warmindedness'.

Many of the more useful feats attributed to wizards are performed by specialists or outliers like LV, Harry or Dumbledore. A normal wizard doesn't really face problems from his fellow humans, and usually only knows/remembers a few basic spells from general education, a few spells they use regularly at work and a household charm or two. Furthermore, the reaction to a new obstacle is to find a magical solution to it AKA learning a new specific spell.

Muggles in contrast are outclassed in every way in any remotely fair scenario. But there is a difference in mindset that would allow them to do significant damage or even win a total war, because most wizards, even the Light sided, would think they were fighting ants. Muggles would be aware they're fighting Chtulhu.

Add in that you can theoretically have someone putting bullets in a target and seeking cover in a few days, if Muggles managed to gain entry, there would be many dead wizards.

Just as muggles can't use nukes nilly willy, most wizards do not know disillusionment, fiendfyre, fidelius... Even a good stunner. They know shields and disarmers... But most lack proficiency.

A fully realized wizard (composite) could wage a one-man war and win unless he got hit by a lucky shot. But as things are shown in canon? It seems like there would be a high death toll on both sides, but muggles have a better chance to recover - and potentially recruit muggleborn old and new to tip the scales.

Going back to Disillusionment - unless they're an outlier or they've had a lot of practice with the spell, it's only a chameleon effect... And inferior to the rare, expensive invisibility cloaks.
