** Since this is a discussion on Daphne Greengrass, I wanted to state a dissenting opinion, since I seem to be the only single person in the fandom that holds it.

I 100% do not see the appeal of using or reading stories where Daphne Greengrass is a major character. She is not a character in the Harry Potter books in any real sense of the word. She exists almost entirely in J.K. Rowling's list of Harry's classmates and a passing mention of Draco marrying her younger sister. She is just a name people attach to what is essentially a pureblood Slytherin OC, and you could just as easily switch her name out with Tracey Davis and it would make no difference to any story. Her characterization consists entirely of fandom tropes.

I am biased, of course, in the sense that I do not like any stories with OCs as major character. I want to read fanfiction about the characters I know and love from canon. Okay, rant over.

**** Yeah, I am just more into the situations changing than the main characters changing. I am glad stories like this exist though, if they make other people happy. And I have read some stories where the OCs' names were so bad they actually made me laugh out loud, so we are in 100% agreement there.

*** Daphne is what is known as an "OC stand-in" ([[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OCStandIn][TV-tropes page here]])

She is a way for the author to have an original character in the story without truly making someone up, since Daphne is a canon character.

** We're given nothing more than a name in Canon, but somehow (And I'm sure someone on here knows exactly how, and can explain) Daphne as the "Ice Queen" was born. Quotes required since she usually thaws on page 2. I like the Daphne(s) from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8586147/1/A-Curse-of-Truth][Curse of Truth]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9720211/1/The-Merging][The Merging]] though.

The Daphne in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6257522/1/A-Fine-Spot-of-Trouble][A Fine Spot of Trouble]] is fun too, but feels like Daphne's name but Tracey Davis's personality.

--------------

You asked for Daphne as she lives in my head however, so I present to you the mishmash of details that have stuck from various fics:

- Pureblood, from the house of Greengrass who stayed out of the first war with Voldemort but are generally viewed with suspicion as they're not a "Light Family"

- Friends (and maybe cousins, roommates, etc) with Tracey Davis, the 'Half-blood cheering-charm-given-human-form'.

- Malfoy's existence (and Gryffindor behavior) makes her want to vomit in her mouth just a bit, and she tries very hard to pretend that they don't share a reality.

- She is embarrassed by her sister Astorias who she thinks ought to have been in Ravenclaw. But Daphne loves her anyway, and will poison your food if you make her cry.

- She reacts violently to hugs. As in stunners at a minimum.

- Resents the idea that she's expected to be a housewife, and reacts violently to any such suggestions (see above).

- Has Arithmancy and Ancient Runes with Hermione, who she... tolerates because she's good at academics.

*** I read on DLP once that it possibly stemmed from Jeconais' fic, [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Perfect_Situations/Perfect_Situations/][Perfect Situations]].

As has been said already, we know almost nothing about her canon-wise. I'm fairly confident that JKR has a browse of the fandom every now and again, though, so who knows: we might just see an article of the 'other students' on Pottermore someday.

Personally, I have ideas for her character within the confines of my own AU fic. She definitely isn't an 'Ice Queen', but she is rather unpleasant at the moment.

P.S. I've seen 'Ophelia' as a middle name more than once.

** (In my head)

--------------

Her family is not poor, but less wealthy than even Harry, and their renown is more for her father having Death Eater associates and being a Wizengamot... person?

She's grown up away from the other families (The Malfoy's / Zabini's / Nott's and so on) courtesy of her mother's influence, and so there's an intrigue the other families have for her when she turns up at Hogwarts and is seen to be a budding beauty.

Thus, we have an inexperienced family girl who has people fawning over her and trying to ensnare her, whilst she thinks their attitudes' deplorable and remains aloof to their advances, thus the "icy" persona outsiders are subjected to.

--------------

Because I despise fics were /children/ act like adults with political machinations and all that shite, wait till year three at least.

** In JKR's 'original 40' notes on the planned characters, she was originally identified as 'Queenie' Greengrass. That plus the obvious bitchy popular girl archtype made her characterization a fait accompli.

My version of Daphne is very much the opposite of fanon. It's based upon what I'd call 'negative space reasoning'.

Pansy ruled the Slytherin girls of Harry's year, so she can't be better at being popular. This also might indicate that she wasn't as attractive, but we have other evidence to consider.

Draco married her younger sister, Astoria, who appeared to be a good fit for whom the trio expected Draco to marry. Was Daphne less desirable or simply unavailable?

At no other point is Daphne referenced in terms of beauty (unlike Cho and the Patils, who were noted to be the most attractive girls of their respective years) or brains or Quidditch skills. She isn't even notable for intimidating strength like Millicent Bulstrode.

So we have a girl in Slytherin who is of no real merit to be mentioned for being exceptional, either bad or good.

I'd say she's a dirty-blonde, slightly portly and otherwise meant to be kept in the background. It could be that she's a somewhat attractive sorority-slag type who started servicing the older Slytherins before she knew how to leverage her sexuality. That's why no one talks about her in the books, but her sister is worth marrying.

*** I'd hazard that a lot of your reasoning ignores the source of a lot of our information. Not necessarily wrong, or invalid, just of questionable source.

Isn't the one who comments on the Patils' beauty Ron? Who I can't see complimenting a Slytherin, even if she is pretty. Also, 'most beautiful' is subjective and will vary from Beholder to Beholder, though they all seem to agree that zapping you with eye lasers is a reasonable way to say hi.

Harry, our unreliable narrator extraordinaire, really only interacted with Malfoy, who had Pansy attached like a barnacle... but then didn't marry her... marrying Astoria instead. So did Pansy die in the war? Or was /she/ the girl Malfoy amused himself with but never planned to marry?

**** Fair point- I think the descriptions of Cho and the Patils were narrative and not dialogue, but that still is limited by Harry's perspective, and he barely had his head above water most days.

I think Pansy lost her bid to be Mrs. Malfoy when she suggested that Harry be given over to the Dark Lord. Even if Draco loved her, she had shot her reputation like a dying horse as far as living in a Harry-victorious world was concerned. This still makes Astoria the second-best choice and Daphne third or even lower on the politically-advantageous marriage front.

***** Not necessarily...

Assuming it's an arranged marriage, and that tells us that the Greengrasses go for that sort of thing... Daphne may have been spoken for by the time Draco needed a replacement for Pansy.

Example: Daphne Zabini nee Greengrass isn't the third-best choice, she's not a choice at all.

Now that I think about it, I'm pretty sure there's a Dramione fic out there where Daphne and Blaise run an underground smuggling operation in a world where Voldemort won... but it's been ages since those wanted posters on Imgur sent me down that very strange road.

** My question is, isn't Daphne a blonde? That's what I always thought, then the last two daphne stories I've read had her with dark hair like Harrys.

Anyway, side note I've always seen pairings with undeveloped characters to be to help the author in a couple ways

A) exploring the cross house relationship dynamics

B) the author thinks the Canon options are poor fits (Ginny, Hermione, and Luna) so use either Daphne, Susan, or other undeveloped background girls to quietly slip their own OC into a story that has already begun.

Don't get me wrong, I like most off the grid pairings. I liked harrys girlfriend in The Refiners Fire more than any other character I've ever read. To me though, that's how most authors use girls like daphne. As a blank slate.
