I'm referring specifically to (probably older) fics that are only hosted on sites like LiveJournal, Dreamwidth, etc. I'm sure there are some gems out there that I've missed due to mainly sticking with FFN & Ao3, so lemme know if you have any recs! Any type of story is fine.

** I used to read exclusively on [[http://www.thepetulantpoetess.com/index.php][The Petulant Poetess]]. Lots of SS/HG if that's your thing. I haven't re-read in a while, but I remember liking the work of dracontia and ladyofthemasque.

** [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/the-next-great-adventure-dresden-files-harry-potter.22941/][The Next Great Adventure]] over on SB. Short summary, Dumbledore appears in the Dresden Files universe. It's as awesome as it sounds.

A close second is [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/path-to-victory-%E2%80%93-a-severus-snape-story-worm-hp.22564/][Path to Victory - A Severus Snape Story]] wherein Snape gets the Path to Victory from Worm.

If you don't know what that is, Path to Victor essentially gives you all of the steps required to carry out any action. Includes ridiculous shit like defeating Voldemort in a duel right from the get-go. It's OP as fuck, but the author manages to do it well.

** fanfics.me and ficbook.net have a lot of good fanfics. Too bad Ficbook is the Russian equivalent to fanfiction.net and fanfics.me has interesting moderation.

** [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheTrinity][The Trinity]] on Beast Lair. (I've linked to the TV Tropes page because there are seven stories.) It's a Nasuverse crossover without Harry. The main characters are ridiculously powerful, but the villians are also powered up so the conflicts have real stakes.
