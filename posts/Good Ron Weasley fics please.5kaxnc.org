Besides obvious ones like Final Reckoning, Choices and Mirror,Mirror, I need good lengthy Ron fics, and action packed, no love stories with no magic at all, serious fics no crack


** The Red Knight

Ron is interesting there, you'd think he's very OP at the beginning... until he is absolutely outclassed as the story unfolds. Seeing him trying to play Hermione and Harry (because actual Hermione hates his guts and Harry... well, it's complicated...) and just barely failing forward is really nice. I mean, the guy had a single clear win throughout the story and now he'll have to give it up too.

And yes, I enjoy watching him suffer. It really elevates his character. It even makes the pretty tropey supportive cast a little better.

  A magical infection has Ron critically ill, but after the devastation of the war he decides his family and friends don't need to know. How long can he hide it though? And how will the consequences of his actions change the course of the future?

** [[Weasley girl by hyaroo]] is an awesome, Ron centric, genderbent ron fic.

[[The book for Morgan le Fey (I hope ffnbot finds it, can't remember the author) is a good, old, Ron centric fic that was released before HBP.

[[Choices by randomfruitcake04]] is a Slytherin Ron fic where he's a seer.

  Ron has the ability to see the future and he has the choice to either let it happen or change it for the better. Not Powerful!Ron. Pairings undecided as of the moment. Latest chapter for fifth year now here! Thanks for reading! Will continue until 7th year.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** Have you tried [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/900634/Solstice-Muse][Solstice Muse's]] fics? She writes pretty lengthy Ron-centric stories... don't know how action-packed they are, but I think they're good.

Or you could try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11230962/1/Son-of-the-archer][Son of the Archer]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11884262/1/Son-of-the-archer-and-The-Boy-Who-Lived][sequel]] by Melancholy's Sunshine. It's an AU in which one year old Ron is kidnapped by Death Eaters, rescued by Hawkeye of the Avengers and grows up as his adoptive son.

Oh, and there's the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8202739/1/Weasley-Girl][Weasley Girl]] stories by Hyaroo, in which Ron was born a girl. First story's more Harry-centric, but the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9932798/1/Weasley-Girl-Secrets-of-the-Past][sequel, Secrets of the Past]] switches to Fem!Ron as the main character.
