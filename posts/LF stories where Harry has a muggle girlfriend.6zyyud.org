  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

  Looking back at the SVM series you have to wonder how things would have been different with a bit of retrospect. So I stuck in a character who knows what she's talking about. She's crass, demanding, hardcore, sexy as sin and... has a million names? Basically this is how 'the girl with a million names' shakes it all up.

*** Seconding Behind Blue Eyes. IIRC some people seem a bit messy at times, but it's a really interesting perspective (a lot of it is written from the OCs POV) about how muggles are viewed by wizards (even the 'good' ones).
