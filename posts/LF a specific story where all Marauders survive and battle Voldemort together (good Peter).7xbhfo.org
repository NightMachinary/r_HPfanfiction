I'm looking for an old story I read many years ago. In it, all the Marauders survive, and band together to battle Voldemort. There may be a prophecy stating that the four of them would stick together to face the evil.

I remember that Sirius was imprisoned for many years (I think he was tortured by Voldemort's cronies), and Remus is the headmaster of Hogwarts (Dumbledore passes his mantle to him). Peter is a good guy, not a betrayer. Sirius escapes and comes back to his friends while Harry is in school. Any help finding this story would be highly appreciated! I believe it was a story and a sequel.

*Sorry, first post on this subreddit, Not sure if I tagged the post correctly with "FicSearch"


** That would be the series (Unbroken Universe) of fics that begins with linkffn(Promises Unbroken). The point of departure is [[/spoiler][Sirius was the Secret Keeper. Peter was still a Death Eater, but turned against Voldemort during the fic. Sirius was captured but never gave the secret up.]].

**** I think the first one was the strongest of them. The others just... dragged on too much.

  Sirius Black remained the Secret Keeper and everything he feared came to pass. Ten years later, James and Lily live, Harry attends Hogwarts, and Voldemort remains...yet the world is different and nothing is as it seems. AU, updated for HBP.
