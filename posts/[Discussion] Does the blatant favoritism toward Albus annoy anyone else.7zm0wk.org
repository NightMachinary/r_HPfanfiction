I think one of the lines that most annoyed me in CC was: "Everything comes easy to James." I highly doubt that. As seen in the Epilogue, Harry doesn't care if James got onto the platform safely. Ginny only reprimands him. It seems to me that James is trying his very best but all of his efforts are ignored.

(I'm just really protective of this kid, and it got even worse in CC.)

**** I'm not trying to incite a bashing of the play (just read every discussion on it ever) but bring attention to an actual issue where parents blatantly ignore one child in favor of another. Even if it's negative attention, the other child becomes jealous. Honestly, if James is a bullying little brat like he's portrayed, it's because of Harry (and Ginny)

***** The original post called for actual discussion and criticism of /CC/. Whether positive or negative, further replies would only be good, accurate discussion if they, y'know, actually discussed a point of view. The post I replied to literally just said "Let's pretend CC doesn't exist", with not even an explanation. That's no discussion at all, positive or negative.

The lesson we should be taking from CC is that just because something is canon doesn't mean it's any good.

****** It's not like she could /not/ endorse it after helping to promote it so much. She'd be losing face. It's the same reasoning as Albus Severus' name. The fanbase is on a global scale so any mistake occurs at the same scale.

As for me, I just focus on Fantastic Beasts, which recovered 2016 for the HP fandom.

******** She's being nice to her collaborators.

She has to be disappointed by reactions to CC, and she's now emphasizing in every interview that Jack Thorne wrote it.

She's saying similar good things about Steve Kloves in public, but only gives him a very minor role in FB, as she's writing the movie scripts herself. Kloves' attempts at subverting the canon must have pissed her off.

******** Because she didn't realize just how the fandom would react when she started promoting it, but by the time of the play's release she /had/ to endorse it.

But that's not the point of my question. I'm talking about how James and Albus sort of reflect Harry and Dudley. I can only hope Albus gets a redemption like Dudley.

*** It's... /not/ a fanfiction. I'm not saying it's /good/, and fans have a right to ignore it (though it's officially canon), but calling it fanfiction seems to be missing the point... and sullying /fanfiction/'s good name.

Let me explain.

"Fanfiction" has the word "fan" right there in it. It is defined, to me, as non-profit writing created by fans of an original work, just because they /want/ to see their idea of a story with those characters they love realized. /Cursed Child/ is nothing like that: it's clear that Rowling decided to do a play, wrote up a summary, and then she /hired/ Tiffany and Thorne to help her clean it up. They obviously don't hate it, but I'm not even sure either of those two are "fans" of HP to a meaningful degree, and I'd wager they did this more for the big money in it than out of a genuine desire to write that play.

/Cursed Child/ isn't any more fanfiction than you would call an /Expanded Star Wars Universe/ or /Expanted Whoverse/ novel a fanfiction. It was written at the original author's request by a writer who's likely doing it for the money more than anything else, and thus is simply not fanfiction.

***** Okay, there's an almost universal consensus that the writing of CC, at least, is a flop. I haven't seen the play, but I've heard it's good on stage, so props to the director (John Tiffany) for that. It takes skilled actors and directors to make poor dialogue into something good.

But the purpose of my question isn't that. It's about the parental neglect.

***** Fanficiton isn't an indicator of quality. It's quite sad that a /fanfiction writer/ would go there. Fanfiction is a genre of literature, and comparing a book of a certain genre's quality to another genre is just reductive of both genres. It's like if I said of a tragedy that it's "just as bad as a comedy", as if it was an inherent part of a comedy to be terrible.
