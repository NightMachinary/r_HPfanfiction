I find it funny that she just pretty much forgot about it.


** I don't think that Umbridge forgot, but there was very little she could legally do as she had threatened them with the Cruciatus, which makes anything Harry and Hermione do self-defence. And given that she was the adult in the forest but she was the one who escalated the situation, there would be little to pin on Hermione either way.

As soon as she could do, she placed Hermione on the Number two most-wanted spot (and not a known Dumbledore supporter like Lupin or Arthur Weasley, or anyone else of the Ministry six), so I would argue that she remembered (movie/video game canon).

*** Which is fair opinion from a legal viewpoint, but this is Umbridge, who managed to get dementors sent to assassinate Harry, with everyone else none-the-wiser.

I'm not surprised she was #2 though. Ron was thought to have been sick with spattergoit.
