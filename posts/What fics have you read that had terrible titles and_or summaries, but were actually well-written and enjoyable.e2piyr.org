I read [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5283979/1/Engaged-Before-the-First-Date][Engaged Before the First Date]], and thought it would be a typical marriage law fic, but was pleasantly surprised at how the author made it into a heartfelt story about George and Hermione dealing with the undeath of Fred.

I'm now wondering what fics I've missed out on because the title or summary was poorly written.

*edit for spacing.


** Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus linkffn(9911469) Summary makes no sense, although I suppose it's fitting for how surreal a fic it is. Very unique and surreal story, not for everyone, but I really liked it.

*** I think I read something once that tied into Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus where Harry meets her and he's MoD, but I've never read the actual story.\\
What summary would you give to someone who never read it?

**** Lily (fem!Harry) is Death, which means she's essentially omnipotent and can't really die. Whenever she 'dies', she meets canon!Harry, who's also Death in his universe, in the train station purgatory. She also meets Voldemort's scar horcrux (who she calls Wizard Lenin) in her dreams, and befriends him. She doesn't really think the world or any of the people around her are real, just a glitchy simulation, as she states explicitly about the Dursley's in this passage:

#+begin_quote
  Tom Riddle had said he liked to make others hurt and then his wardrobe had been on fire.

  Eleanor Potter said she didn't give a damn about her relatives opinions and feelings; what would Dumbledore make of her then?

  For a moment she forgot about Quirrell, about Rabbit's alarming tendency towards sentience, only the cold feeling growing inside her. A quiet bottomless rage that asked how Dumbledore could just sit there and look at her, the thing he had supposedly created, and say that it wasn't working properly?

  “They are automatons, thoughtless simulations of humanity that serve no real purpose, they like to think that they can think.” She said staring Dumbledore in the eye, her own voice cold, “And they put on a good show, for the most part, but if you're around long enough it all falls to pieces and the bugs in the programming show through.”

  He looked alarmed, perhaps not expecting that from her, although what he did expect wasn't clear. She felt one of Wizard Lenin's jagged grins stretching on her face.

  “They like to think they're human, but they're not.”

*** I must say though, after reading it, the summary makes quite a lot of sense. It is pretty accurate on how the story goes without spoiling anything. Its just such an unusual story that at first it doesn't really make sense.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

** It often amazes me how many people are not particularly good at summaries. Just say what the story is about and how it diverts from canon. Damn. Too many summaries are full of cringe like quotes about "fweelings", acronyms, abbreviations, exclamation marks in the middle of nowhere instead of using a perfectly normal dash or comma, made-up words from combining two characters' names or my favourite- character initials like- HP/LV/DM/SS.

But this time let's go with "Cold Blood". The summary is a one-liner: "Sometimes, the tide of events really changes a person." No shit, Sherlock. Otherwise, it's a very entertaining fic to read.

** Have you read linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11111990/1/Grow-Young-with-Me]])? Summary sounds unbearably sappy, but the actual story is great. Harry has been widowed and is struggling to cope, but is very devoted to his three kids and keeps going for them. And then he meets someone quirky and funny and clumsy, who drags him out of his shell and helps him enjoy life again.

** As far as titles go definitely "FILFY Teacher" by Vimesenthusiast. The summary doesn't do the story justice either, but at least it fits better than the title... Really, if the author did not have two other stories that are insanely good that I had already read, I would never have read this one because of the title. Luckily I did end up giving it a go and found a very fun read with great writing and worldbuilding. I didn't know the crossover universe before, but he does a great job integrating and explaining. So, the title would let me assume its a badly written smut story written by a 13 year old, but really its quite the opposite. Barely any smut and serious and very interesting plot. Will never know why in the world he went with that title :D
