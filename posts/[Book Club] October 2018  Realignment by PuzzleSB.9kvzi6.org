** There is so much to say about this fic for me. So I'll break it into a pros and cons list:

*Pros:*

- The magic and action sequences in this story are some of the most visceral and thrilling I have come across. From beginning to end, it grips you and tries to put everything it has to display on the table.
- One of the /best/ opening scenes/chapters in any fic I have ever come across. Harry's arrival, and seeing it not through the eyes of one of the powerful wizards but Tom Riddle himself, sets up a brilliant time-travel story that is only hinted at in the background.
- Never spends the whole time explaining every little detail of the world. Not every spell or worldbuilding piece or event needs detailed extrapolation. Thats what makes magic...well....magical. Saying more with less, something too many authors seem to fail to understand.
- Tom Riddle in this fic is the sole POV, a rarity honestly for 1st person limited HP fics. Whats more, his characterization is actually pretty believable. He's no saint - Tom wants power and strength. What changes is that he sees that his previous intimations of power pale in comparison to what Harry, Dumbledore, and later Grindelwald are capable of exhibiting. That is the crucial change, along with Dumbledore's partial mentorship. Not only that, but the idea of how Tom learns new magic, by emulating Harry's spells and techniques, is a clever twist on the Horcrux storyline, though a bit hard to explain.
- Tom and Dumbledore's mentorship is a highlight as well. Dumbledore isn't overbearing, he merely wants to keep Tom alive and maybe steer him away from his own past mistakes. Tom is also pretty hesitant, but keeps around both for his safety and the admiration for his teachers abilities with magic. In short, their motivations are very believable within the contexts of the story (at least until the end).
- Goblins are assholes. 'Nuff said.
- The discussions on Old Magic being inferior were rather refreshing compared to all the dumb "family magic" fics that are just short cuts to overpowering characters.
- The clever twist in the final battle: Tom Riddle = The Boy-Who-Lived
- No one ever bothers to reveal the time-travel stuff to the world, something which is shockingly rare in almost every fandom I have read tt fics in. Kudos.

*Cons:*

- The writing in this story, from a technical standpoint at least, is well above 95% of fics I have encountered. That said, just going back through the first chapter I can find slight errors and mistakes (mostly grammatical). It reads (and I can semi-confirm this from the earlier versions) like PuzzleSB was writing in a rush, trying to get as much out in a single setting as possible.
- The story is a bit piecemeal in its overall plot (if you can call it that). Boiled down, the author basically wanted to write that beginning scene, then didn't have a huge deal planned past that. The following is more or less a series of interspersed fight scenes as the author vacillated from one idea to the next. In a certain way that is enjoyable, in that guessing the future is nigh impossible for a reader, but on the other hand it loses the brilliance that a well-structured story can bring out.
- The ending. Having seen how this actually played out, as well as the authors comments on other forums like SB, I can say that basically he was running out of steam by the DoM scenes. The final chapter was essentially a result of Puzzle getting tired of the fic and just wanting it to have an end and be done with it. The result is less than spectacular, but I do admit I rather like it when things are not all wrapped up with a nice bow and explained how this person and that person lived there lives out pointlessly.

Summary:

This story is basically a magical version of Terminator 2. Replace Tom Riddle with John Connor, Harry with the T-1000, and Dumbledore with the T-800, and that about sums up a lot of this story (you could also compare it to Fate/Unlimited Blade Works but that is a whole nother can of worms). As a bonus, Gellert Grindelwald is also the T-X in this version, with Harry even getting in a one-liner at the end.

â€‹

Overall: 4.5/5, lowered from 5/5 due mainly to the ending.

I thought that the off-the-wall style plot might be intentional. For one thing it underlines how Riddle is continually out of his depth throughout the story, barely able to get his bearings before circumstances change beyond his control. Each new experience humbles him, taking his ego down a peg just when he is starting to feel self-satisfied.

The plot has a bit of the "hero's journey", Terry Gilliam style. Riddle is swept into a zany adventure of character growth, quite against his will. The people in control (Dumbledore, Grindelwald) carry Tom along from scene to scene a bit like the under-powered protagonists in /Time Bandits/ or /The Adventures of Baron von Munchhausen/. Overall, I think the absurdity is intentional.

#+begin_quote
  The ending.
#+end_quote

If the absurdity is intentional, then the ending is the capstone that put's Tom's heroic journey in perspective. You have these three Gryffindors acting ludicrously heroic and larger than life, and then Tom seizes his One True Moment To Shine in pure Slytherin fashion. The contrast between Gryffindor "honor" and Slytherin pragmatism is deliciously ironic.

In my opinion, Tom's final conversation with Dumbledore was a perfect way to end the story because it shows what Tom has learned from the journey and what Dumbledore has learned about Tom (to his chagrin). Things seem to have reset to the way they were when the fic started, but with the main characters looking at their lives in a new light; a circle typical of "heroic journey" stories.

**** I'm not arguing how the final product came out. It's just I have the authors actual words to attest to those view points. They started the fic with really only the first scene and just ran with things from new idea. That is their own statement.

When writing, your ideas change and shift into something else, sometimes in a direction you never really intended. This fic is interesting in that Puzzle really had no idea how they wanted to end this initially, and kind of threw darts at the board to keep the plot moving and start more fights. It's both a strength and weakness of the overall story, from where I stand.

It works, it just wasn't as intentional as it comes across to a lot of people. Kind of like how people assume Rowling had as much planned as she said, when she really just changed parts later in the series to explain earlier elements of the series.

** I'm a big fan of this fic. The action sequences are tightly written and visceral; the author nailed Dumbledore and Riddle's interactions; the setting and the magic feels similar to canon, but a bit more raw and knotty, just how I like it.

And unlike some, I quite liked the ending. The fic was an action movie, not a bildungsroman. Riddle and Dumbledore were never going to iron their issues out 100%, and it was always going to end with only one of Dumbledore, Grindelwald or Bond standing. The twists in the final scene were clever (if a little hard to follow at times) and thematically fitting.

Criticisms:

- That first scene is a grammatical trainwreck. I recommended it to a friend and they couldn't get past the first chapter because of it.

- The Bond/dream sequences are completely unnecessary and drag down the fic. Their only seeming purpose is to show the connection between Bond and Riddle.

But yeah, still a solid 4/5. One of the best I've read.

** The fic was really refreshing. I enjoyed the magic being magical and mystical, and the look into the greater wizarding world.

Something about the way the author writes was kinda jarring to me. It might've been the long sentences that kind of felt unnatural, but I can't quite put my finger on it

  Or sneak in and kill Tom from ambush.
#+end_quote

That particular plan would have been more risky because of the way the Hogwarts wards function. Dumbledore gave some exposition in chapter 3:

#+begin_quote
  "Why do you think he attacked head on? He probably could have sneaked in."

  Dumbledore was silent for a moment, looking around as if to ensure he hadn't missed anything fixing the room. "Hogwarts is said to be the safest place in Britain, that's true up until a point. The wards around the castle were not erected by fools and every Headmaster has left his mark. Most made them better, at least three weakened them unintentionally, and a surprising number allowed them to be lowered in Quidditch point shaving schemes."

  His wand moved again and the rude table in the corner straightened with carved ivy growing up the legs as the scrapes and engravings of bored students were erased from the top. "However they are old magic at their heart. You grew up in the muggle world and are a skilled enough student that you think of magic logically. It's a rare talent in the magical world precisely because the fairy tales you dismissed do have some truth. Sleeping Beauty, Rumpelstiltskin, Snow White, they all feature powerful magic falling to a simple illogical condition. The wards are similar, anyone hostile to the students will be frustrated. If your attacker had attempted to sneak in, his schemes would be thwarted, his plans foiled. In contrast his direct attack didn't run against the older magic, he became the knight slashing through the thorns if you will."

  "So the wards only work against treachery?" Tom had noticed the lack of analytical thought before and had used it to his benefit. Realizing that there might have been a reason for the purebloods' occasional idiocy was a rude surprise.

  "Oh not at all, they are immensely powerful in all senses that you can think of and regularly updated, I just think the attacker chose to brave the more conventional ones rather than meddle with old magic. He did have some small success in that manner."

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

** I certainly agree with those of you who've said that the opening chapter is one of the best around. It really is. It grabs the reader instantly and brings them right into the story.

After that though, I got a bit bored. The action scenes were pretty good but were pretty much interchangeable.The joke about Harry's name being Bond got a bit old, although I agree with [[/u/cryptologicalMystic]] that the "No Mister Bond, I expect you to die" line was well done.

I think the problem was that it's pretty much an obvious plot: there was always going to be a showdown between Tom and Harry in which one died. After a while I just wanted the story to get on with it.

All in all it was a story worth reading but I doubt I'll ever go back to it.
