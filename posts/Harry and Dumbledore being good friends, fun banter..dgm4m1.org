Fics like Barefoot, Dear Order, Where In The World is Harry Potter, etc. left me craving for a fun Dumbledore, preferably one that has a good banterous relationship with Harry.

Gimme gimme all you have! Thanks!

  Saving the Philosopher's Stone opened Harry's eyes to a greater spectrum. Sometimes, all it takes for someone to grow is a dash of trust and a dollop of inspiration. Harry returns for his fourth year amidst the threat of the Dark Lord and a veil long parted---and his eyes are full of stars.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand and the incentive to survive. Thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

  Terrible things happen to wizards who meddle with time. When that wizard is Harry Potter, the terrible things tend to happen to other people instead. Fourth Year. Time Travel.

**** "Alright Professor hold this i'm going in" Harry said while shrugging off his cloak

"Harry I really don't think" Professor Dumbledore didn't get to finish as Harry jumped down into the Chamber of Secrets entrance laughing the entire way down.

Dumbledore sighed and looked to his left at Myrtle who's face had take on a rather shocked expression "Always on the move that one, right well hold the fort for me my dear lady, I'll bring our errant hero back safe and sound" with that Dumbledore jumped down the entrance as well, beard fluttering the entire way down.
