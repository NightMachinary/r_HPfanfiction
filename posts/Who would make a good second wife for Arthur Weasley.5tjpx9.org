I'm writing a collaborative timeline with a few other people involving multiple fandoms. There's been a few changes already. For one, Molly Weasley (also Bill, George, Fred and Charlie) were killed leading to Arthur moving his children out of the Burrow and someplace new.

I was thinking of adding that Arthur (after a respectable amount of years after losing the first love of his life) might remarry. I'm just stuck on WHO he might remarry. I though about killing off Lucius Malfoy and in a twist have him remarry Narcissa (just for the irony of Ron and Draco being stepbrothers) but eventually decided that was too farfetched. I'm just wondering if anybody might have any ideas as to who he could remarry (he now lives in a muggle neighborhood so if you have any ideas from Muggle tv shows or books that take place around the same time that could also work).


** In my opinion, feel free to disagree but he wouldn't marry a muggle. My reasoning being that he is, in his own way rather awful to muggles, he treats them like an adorable pet or talks about them in the way someone might a chimp when you see them using tools. He finds them fascinating but is constantly accidentally condescending. He is a pureblood, with a quirk. Assuming this is post 98, he'd either find a similar minded witch who shares a similar past, e.g. Emillene Vance or some other Order witch who's age is unknown or a quiet witch who retreated from the world after the first war or travelled, either way is far more innocent that the world weary Arthur and brings a freshness to his life. Something to break him out of his depression.

That could be a great part to a fic though. I'd love to read about Arthur realizing it and changing. It'd be a good source of internal conflict. He loses his wife and children and realizes he's racist on top of it. Once he starts to make headway on the issue, he has to field the same behavior from his children, family, and peers. It could be done really well

*** Thanks. You make a great point but to be fair, this Arthur has lived among muggles since 1986 (the idea was to make a subversion of the normal fics where Harry has such a different childhood and becomes this impossibly powerful person. Here, it's both Ron and Hermione who have incredibly different childhoods and Harry has the exact same canon childhood). Still, you are right that he is slightly racist against muggles in his own way.

**** You didn't add the date in the post so I was assuming bellatrix vs Molly went the expected way with no plot armour. :/

***** More than fair. I really should have added the date. That being said, it was an escaped Bellatrix that did kill her. As I said, it's a collaborative timeline with multiple fandoms (most don't intersect in more than a few ways). Harry Potter does a little more than most. We have kind of a "catch-all" bad guy who appears over multiple plotlines just to wreck havoc implied to be the Devil himself. He breaks Bellatrix out and leads her to the Burrow (hoping she would kill Ron as he knows the support Ron could later lend Harry and thus allowing Voldemort to win) but she failed to do so. Arthur moves his remaining children out of the Burrow ASAP because he doesn't want them to live where their mother and siblings died and in Percy's case, where he was tortured.

If Snape survived, he could get Narcissa.

** Andromeda Tonks or Hestia Jones, maybe. He couldn't marry Vance or Burbage if this is a post 2nd war fic, as both died.

** Amelia Bones, she seems like someone who could provide some structure in his life and they would be able to understand each other since a lot of Amelia's immediate family was also killed by Voldemort and his followers. Her niece Susan Bones is also in Harry's year. Another plus is that she works in the ministry.

Andromeda Tonks is another one I think would work, but seeing as this is happening after the first war with Voldemort Ted Tonks would still be alive. So for them to get together Ted Tonks has to be killed or they have to separate. I like that Andromeda is a kind and brave Slytherin, I think being raised by a Slytherin like Andromeda would have a big impact on Ron and some of the prejudices he develops about people from Slytherin.

** Narcissa actually was the first person to come to mind for me. While they have significant differences, Arthur is a family man, and Narcissa has shown that she cares far more about her son then anything else, and she could open up to having stepchildren. A muggleborn might work, but Arthur really wouldn't work with a muggle. (Though Arthur/Marge would make an amusing crackfic.)

Actually, as much as I think Arthur's condescension and lack of actually understanding muggles, I know find I'd like to read an Arthur/Petunia fic. Maybe witch!Petunia?
