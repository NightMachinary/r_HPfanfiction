If so, why is that? I like a good rehash, but it's getting a bit repetitive to be honest.


** It not even that most are set in 4 in my experience.

Books 1-3 are pretty basic fare as far as staple childrens and YA novels go. (Their meta being another thing altogether.)

But 4 is the first Rowling treats the fans to a proper introduction to epic style fantasy storytelling.

Goblet of Fire is simply the cemetery of good but not really that great fan-authors.

*** Agreed, the series really opens up in Goblet. We get so much confirmation and new info on magical life in Wizarding Britain as a whole and in the wider Wizarding community, one of my favorite aspects and something the later books didnt do as well IMHO. Hallows wouldve been great if they explored Magical Europe

I think Order isnt as popular a launching point because a lot of fan authors think Harry is just "emo" or whatever and dont understand he is (justifiably) suffering from PTSD, and that's hard to write for someone, probably, in their teens or 20s.

** In addition to what others have said, I think it also has a lot to do with when the original books were released.

Harry Potter sold pretty well, but book 3/4 is really when it hit widespread exposure. So back in the early days, when the fanfic tropes and cliches were first being written, there was a huge explosion of fanfic that took place right around then, because the budding authors consumed the first few books in a weekend and just plain ran out of canon. So they just started writing from the end of canon.

** Harry's old enough to where you can start thinking about pairings, as well as there being some impetus to actual learn more interesting magic.

** I think one of the main reasons for this is because it when Harry's most life changing events happen Spoilers.. eg in the fourth book, Cedrics death gives great room for character development. Ron's betrayal and abandonment of harry leaves room for him to make new friends it has a lot of openings for change, as the harry potter world opens like the introduction of new schools and a wider wizarding world it gives more opportunity to break away from canon, as well as a justifiable reason. In the fifth book with voldemort's return it also gives an author opportunity to give harry a chance to improve himself and dedicate himself to study, him suffering from PTSD from Sirius's death and if there was a will, its also when harry gets mad at Dumbledore. What Im trying to say is there are lots of ways to justify or explain, the what and the why of divergence from cannon, well thats my opinion Harry is just that little bit older and the outside world is showing its and affecting him more aswell.

** Well, most are definitely NOT set after 4th year, if that's any consolation, but most are probably actually 1st year fic's that are discontinued. 4th year is about as late as most fic's get though...

** Year 4 is where romance starts happening for a lot of students (True long-term relationships start around Year 6, but those usually aren't as... "exciting" since relationships become more of a background interest at that point). The fact that the Yule Ball is there enhances this further (Fics set in different eras tend to get around this by introducing their own Ball for similar reasons -- several Marauder-era fics have Slughorn's Christmas Party take its place, for example). Considering how shipping is basically the most common reason people write fanfics, and there you go.

** Old enough to bang (without most of the extra creep factor) and young enough to actually affect canon, with in-world important characters regularly around the castle to affect the plot as needed. Plus a tournament where you can implement magic ideas without it being super contrived.

**** According to plenty of other fiction and a shrinking number of real life people, sure. I'd say 16 is a more universally acceptable age, but seeing as how some states in the US still allow marriage at 13 with parental consent, at least some still believe that.

*** PoA and GoF are also the easiest set-ups for romance since the relevant plot events don't take up too much time. Compare three tournament tasks and the Yule Ball to, lets say Umbridge or the continuous investigations into Malfoy (CoS/HBP) or the Philosopher's stone and Snape.

And Harry's isolation after being chosen is as good as introductions for a love interest get. She stood with Harry when no one else did and voila, romance. And the later books are really bad for romance because Harry should be worrying about Voldemort and not trying to score a buxom blonde. The only valid romances are Hermione or whoever gets taken along for the hunt (Fleur or Tonks, Ginny and Luna are underage and therefore unable to cast spells).

It's actually quite difficult to fit a romance into books 6 and 7.
