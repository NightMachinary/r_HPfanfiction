I recently read (and greatly enjoyed) [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5537755/1/Amends-or-Truth-and-Reconciliation][Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation]]. Are there any other fanfics that tackle re-assembling the wizarding world post-war? I've seen a bunch about the personal side, but not that focus on the big picture.

So, recs?


** Warning - "Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation" is unfinished :(

** Maybe not focusing on big picture, but it is about 1/3 - The Golden Age [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3682339/24/The-Golden-Age]] (completed, extremely depressing, canon compliant but also subversion of canon)

** Anything by little0bird is awesome. This one starts right where the 7th book left off. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4367121/1/The-First-Day]]

*** I just finished "There'll be bluebirds" and it was so lovely. While not a cleaning up the world fic, it was great insight into Remus Lupins life.
