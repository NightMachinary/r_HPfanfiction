I'm on my 4th reread of Prince of the Dark Kingdom right now and I just hit a quote that's so stupid it makes me chuckle every time I read it.

#+begin_quote
  Harry really couldn't help himself. It was just too perfect. "A little birdie told me so." -PotDK c.89
#+end_quote

As well as

#+begin_quote
  "How about I take it like a fourteen year old and sit in my room until I've learned my lesson."
#+end_quote

What are some quotes that never fail to put a smile on your faces? Ideally without context.


** I will never fail to be amused by

#+begin_quote
  "This," Dumbledore said, "was your father's rock."
#+end_quote

from ch. 17 of HPMOR.

#+begin_quote
  "Can you just tell me why..." Harry paused. "Hang on. You were jumping up and down on the nundu. That's why the watermelon blasted out of the dead nundu's mouth."

  "You know that's one of those lines," Sirius idly commented, "that may never have been uttered before in all history."

  "I flew out of there, dodging her fireblasts until one of the little guys bit down and managed to get a firm hold of my cape."\\
  "Hang on," Sirius interrupted. "Cape?"\\
  Harry nodded. "Well I looked silly with only a codpiece and a helmet on. The cape made all the difference."

*** Without a doubt. I've always wondered how it would've ended. My head canon is that Harry would end up killing Voldemort, but he would be ok with it and it would end with Harry meeting what were led to believe is the reincarnation of Voldemort.

But there's was so much fucking world building that could've been played with there. Maybe voldy would've ended up king of the fae or become a god. Maybe Harry would lose and he would be reborn again or other pagan shinanagins.

I doubt it will ever be picked up and there's way too much in that story for it even to be adopted correctly by a solid group of people. But I hope the author isn't dead like many people think cuz that's depressing as hell.

After extensive further interrogation, it admitted to being a British wizard named Tom Riddle and confessed its goal was to regain its body. After prolonged further interrogation, it admitted to being a foreign counterrevolutionary agent and agreed that its goal was to make the pain stop."

  Harry took his time, savoring the moment while being just decent enough to try not to be too brazen about it. Nonchalantly looking at his fingernails and deciding that he would later cut them, he finally revealed with another shrug of his shoulder, "I ran."

  Her lower jaw did that thing again where it just hung a little. "You... you /ran/?"

  "Yeah," he confirmed with a nod. "It's like walking, but faster. You should give it a try sometime."
