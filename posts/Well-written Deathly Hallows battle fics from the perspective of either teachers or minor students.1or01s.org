** Obviously it's like 100 times longer than what you're looking for, but you should check out Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4315906/]] It's like 25 looong chapters (for FanFiction at least). But it's insanely good. You get a much more intimate view into the lives of all the non-Harry/Ron/Hermione kids during the 7th novel. They create an army led by Neville to fight the Death Eaters. I don't want to ruin anything, but damn. It's so good.

And if you're just looking for battle scenes, chapter 21 is a very detailed account of the Battle of Hogwarts (focusing, of course, on the characters it focuses on throughout the story). Super gory, though. You get more out of that scene after having read the rest of the story, but it could stand on it's own.

I would seriously recommend this to anyone. It's written almost better than the original books. I loved it. Give it a try.

*** I read that, actually liked it quite a bit and I have extremely high standards. The author did a good job with what is, to be fair, probably one of the easiest time periods in fanfiction to write about.

**** Yeah, I completely agree. This kind of story has been done to death, but this author had something different. I still cry reading it every time. Gets me right in the feels without even trying.

*** I completely agree with this and second the recommendation. The thing I love about DAYD is not only us getting to see Neville's journey, but how much we get to know other characters like Hannah, Ernie, Susan, Seamus, Colin, Michael, Terry, Parvati, Padma, etc.

** There aren't that many true war fics floating around. There are even fewer good ones. Truthfully, if you find a fic that does magical warfare justice, please PM me. I have nothing that corresponds to what you're asking for and find myself intrigued.

*** I read a fic a long, long time ago based around a system of dueling, heavy on a decent OC and I think Moody. AU though. That's all I can immediately think of.

But for this I was really looking more for 1-3 chapter oneshots. Nothing groundbreaking, just a different perspective.
