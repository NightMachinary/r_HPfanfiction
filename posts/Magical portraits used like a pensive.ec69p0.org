If the portrait has all a wizards memories then you could create one and consult it about a whole lot of things. It would be able to remind you about everything you know about a person and stop you forgetting important information. Even small things that happened a lomg time ago and a short time ago if you can continuosly add to it so it is as accurate as possible. Where did you put that letter, your portrait knows. What did your partner say they wanted for christmas, the portrait knows. When was your anniversary, the portrait knows. Magical portraits would make a far better personal assistant because it knows what you know, thinks like you think and has a perfect memory to remind you of meetings and important things. To go back over a key event the portrait could answer all your questions about it and describe it in detail.


** So, would this be a portrait of yourself? If so, then they'd be likely to forget the same things... And might be just a tad bit annoying...

**** Because it would have the same personality and so would be likely to forget the same things.

***** I wrote about a magical portrait in my fic that uses pensieve and portrait magic as well as the memories of many people to create a portal into a memory (like a pensieve) that allows people to interact with historical figures (Lieutenant James Holman on the HMS Eden ported at Fernando Po in the 1800s, in this case). It was really fun to write.

***** My thoughts on hiw the portrait worked was that it used all of your memories that you give it to create a life like copy of yourself. It doesn't actually have a piece of you inside it but rather imitates you by using your memories. This means it has access to all your memories and portraits tend to be a shallow version of the real person. Mcgonogall tells Harry that Dumbledore's portrait isn't really him so don't be disappointed if he is not the same (I think). It's not a real you but an impersonation of you based on your memories to create a you like portrait.
