Why is it that Fanfiction gets stringent on MA fictions every couple of years? For instance, you can find very graphic PWPs on the site from 2000-2005, 2010-2019, but lately all the authors I read are saying that there's been another "crackdown".


** This is why ffn sucks both for readers who are looking for porn (since they can't reliably find it) and readers who want to avoid porn (since it can appear out of the blue.) AO3's tagging system is much better for everyone.

**** Agreed. Not only do you have to deal with multiple different versions of the same tag, there are the authors that seem to want to post their entire fic in the Tags section. Just tag the major/important/central characters, not everybody that gets even a passing mention! If I have to scroll just to get from the title to the summary, I'm going to keep on scrolling.

***** They also still have the bad habbit of not tagging shit that really should be tagged. If I remove Harry/Draco I don't want to find a fic that has them romancing that was either not tagged or tagged Harry&Draco

*** Honestly, AO3's tagging system is a bit garbage too. You can't reliably sort out m/m without filtering out every single pairing individually. Half the time the tags are basically unique to that specific story or a full sentence.

FF.net has too little tagging, and AO3 has too much.

For searching FF try DLP's Scryer. You can search summaries for keywords to filter in or out.

*** I avoid a03 for that reason -- the tags are unbearable. I find it much much easier to search things on ffnet. Or ask people here. The only times I've found something on ao3 worth reading were when someone here recommended it to me. I'll also get an average of ca. 500 followers on ffnet on my stories, while the searching and tagging algorithm on ao3 makes things so complicated that I'm lucky if I get three comments per chapter.

*** That is also a problem with AO3. The pelthorra of tags attached to one story is overwhelming. Also Its really hard to filter out crossovers or filter out tags in AO3. Non standard tags in AO3 cause a massive problem to filter out good from junk and ao3 has a lot of junk.

**** There is one. Is not great by any accounts, but I use it and it suits my needs when I can't use the browser version(which I prefer to the app for aesthetic reasons mainly, like the design of the app isn't great, but evrything works the same as the browser)

**** As a compromise, remember that you can easily download fics as ebooks from AO3. That way you can get a specific fic to read offline easily.

*** With the plethora of tags in AO3, it is a real pain to filter out specific content stories. I try to avoid romance stories, on FFN, I select the No Romance tag, and that is it. On AO3, a lot of the writers do not use the romance tag, so I have to go through and filter out the different relationships, click search, filter out even more relationships, click search, filter out even more relationships, until finally I get a list of stories with no romantic overtones.

Anyhow, luckily there are other sites.
