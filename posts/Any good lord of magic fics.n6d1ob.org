I vaguely remember reading a fic years ago wherein Harry was declared lord of Magic, and magic itself would change whatever he liked to fit his whims. I suddenly got a hankering for cracky fics like that, so any and all recommendations, no matter how weird or out there, would be greatly appreciated
