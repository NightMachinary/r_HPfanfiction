I actually got this idea from a video by Harry Potter folklore. It basically said that Voldemort would've been more political and would want to dominate the world through politics. It's an Au. But I am kind of interested in how a story like this would play out.


** “Stayed married” as in the muggle Tom Riddle couldn't escape from his rapist? I can't help but think that young Tom would still grow up pretty warped in a family like that. Probably warped in a different way though.

*** I don't think we have real information about how Merope actually treated Riddle Sr while he was under her thrall. His reaction of fleeing her is entirely understandable and justified, but I guess it's not impossible that they could have built an actual relationship if he had decided to.

I don't know, it's hard to imagine how I would react if I found myself in that kind of situation. Too far outside my actual life experience.

** He wouldn't have hated muggles that much, I think, He would still have become stronger as he was quite talented from the beginning. Maybe He and Dumbledore could have become great friends. Who knows.
