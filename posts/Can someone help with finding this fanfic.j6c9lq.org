:END:
This fanfic was not finished when I read it. Timeline diverged on graveyard, if I am not mistaken. Tom Riddle is actually a good -ish gye, who is not anti-muggleborn, he deceaved purebloods to follow him. In that universe Dumbledore, his closest followers and highest politicians use sacrifice of muggleborns to give them more magical power and longevity. Riddle explains that to Harry, who reluctantly joins him after some time. Later, to protect Hermione, Harry asks Riddle for help, and he uses his connections to fake documents, identifing Hermione's parents. They were changed to Dolohovs or something similar. After some time Hermione too joins Riddle.


** I think you mean "Honey" linkffn(9268425)

It has the muggleborn sacrifice and Riddle makes fake documents so Hermione's real father is Dolohov.
