This has been driving me nuts and I cant remember what fic it is.

I remember Harry having a really good memory and doing a transfiguration of some magical clay into a statue of one the Patil sisters in their clubbing gear. This leads to Zabini's Aunt coming to Hogwarts to teach art to everyone but focusing heavily on Dean. He and Harry also make skateboards if I remember correctly. Eventually Snape ends up with Zabini's Aunt. There's other stuff but that's the only specifics I remember that are definitely that story rather than the thousands of others Ive read!

Anyone who can tell me what this fic is will have my eternal gratitude because it is right on the tip of my tongue and I cant remember it
