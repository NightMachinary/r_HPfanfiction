** Harry? No. But you might like linkffn(What's Her Name in Hufflepuff), which does (a good and funny job of) exactly this with an original character. Incomplete but active.

For me, linkffn(Victoria Potter) has a similar feel.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.

  What if Voldemort made a mistake with his Horcruxes? What if he had truly been vanquished that fatefull night? What if the Dursley's didnt treat Harry like crap, but rather with casual indifference? Who would Harry become and what would his world look like? Read along with a seventh year Harry as he goes through his diary of Hogwarts and experience his best and worst moments! AU

** The Definition of Normal by Brilliant Lady

I barely remember this one.

Edit: Bugger this, I'll just link it:

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11591125/1/]]

Ignore FFN bot, it's got the wrong one. There's also The Best Revenge by Arsinoe de Blassenville, where Harry makes friends and is just another student. But it's mentor!Snape and (IIRC) Snape/Charity

** What do you mean by “normal life”? That whole Voldemort thingy doesn't exist, or that the fic is focused more on normal life of students rather than just the battle scenes? I am afraid the first one would be for Harry so AU, that I don't care about it, for the second one, I really liked linkffn(5677867). There was also a short fic how Lavender intentionally behaved liked an idiot, because whole purpose of her relationship with Ron was to make him to come to his senses and ask Hermione out, but I cannot find it ATM (“I mean, really, Parvati, what could be more obvious than giving Ron this hideous necklace for Christmas?”).

  The story of "Harry Potter and the HBP", but told from the 3rd person POV of Ginny Weasley. Strictly in-canon. Suitable for anyone whom the "Harry Potter" novels themselves would be suitable for.
