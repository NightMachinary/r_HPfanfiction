Well written, the longer the better. A multi-chapter fic with a plot would make me swoon.

** While I have no /actual/ recommendations, let alone ones that are long and well-written, this request made me curious. I asked myself, are there any Hermione/Molly fics out there? And therefore, I decided to ruin my mind by finding out. A cursory FFN search has informed me that the answer is yes.

And they are:

linkffn(Second Chance, Prewett by SilverFoxen)

linkffn(Serendipity by Sela McGrane)

linkffn(Colder Weather by drippingwithsin) I don't think I've ever seen a more appropriate author name.

linkffn(One Big Gay Weasley Family by architect 2010) And I think this one wins my "I Hate this title more than any other" award.

And if you'll excuse me, I need to go and find a way to remove this knowledge from my brain, before madness claims me.

*** hahaha, I'm strangely embarrassed to admit that Molly or Arthur didn't actually occur to me. I am forever indebted to you (in one way or another) for this list.

One of these years, I will stop underestimating fanfiction authors.

**** Further research has restored my faith in the possibility of good existing in the human soul when a search of FFN has found 0 Hermione/Victoire pairings, 0 Hermione/Fred II, 0 Hermione/Dominque, 0 Hermione/Hugo, 0 Hermione/Louis, 0 Hermione/Lucy, 0 Hermione/Muriel (though not a Weasley even though FFN claims she is, I had to check this possibility), and only 5 Hermione/Arthur.

Sadly, that hope was dashed by the existence of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10000910/1/Is-this-really-how-it-is][this fic]]

EDIT: Almost forgot a couple. 0 Hermione/Roxanne, 0 Hermione/Molly II.

I think that pairing for the fic was a misclick by the author, possibly clicking Rose instead of Ron Weasley's name. Because there's no mention of Rose anywhere in said fic (or so control+f tells me). So /hopefully/ the count remains at zero for that particular pairing.

  The war had cost many lives, and propriety had destroyed many others. For Molly Weasley, her life would go on, but the wizarding tradition of one marriage, and one marriage only left her alone after the final battle had taken the life of her husband, Arthur. As for Hermione Granger, being a know-it-all will mean making a very tough choice. To offer comfort, or to walk away?

*** In general, I remember both Inell and atruwriter having decent quality Weasley/Hermione fics. Lots of one-shots, but you know, you take what you can get with this kind of rarepair. ;)

The books_freckles LJ community is also worth a look (and you don't need to have a livejournal to read fic recs): [[http://books-freckles.livejournal.com/]]

-->I found one post on this LJ community called "the ultimate Fred/Hermione fic listing" which might be of interest: [[http://books-freckles.livejournal.com/458364.html]] (can't attest to the quality of all the fics, but it's a good place to start)

Also, a Hermione/Fred/George fic:
