So I am starting another rant about tropes I see in fics. I will preamble with the fact that, yes, Minerva McGonagall is a powerful personality, capable witch and definitely talented with magic. That's undeniable.

However I get confused as to why people wank so much around her. She might be stern but she's definitely not the voice of reason at Hogwarts. She spied on the Dursleys for a whole day and then she bent to Dumbledore's will (despite her warnings) to leave Harry with them. This is the woman that punished a guy who endangered his life by making him seeker in the Quidditch house team. This is the woman that punished more harshly her own house than Draco. This is the woman that sent four eleven year olds with a giant she didn't trust and who was quite lax about dangers at night in the Forbidden Forest while a unicorn killer was on the loose. This is the woman that ignored Harry's warnings that the Stone was in danger and did nothing to stop three kids from doing anything stupid. This is the woman that gave as detention writing fan letter responses to someone who broke the Statute of Secrecy. This is the woman that allowed a Dementor to give the kiss to a key witness in Voldemort's return. This is the woman that told Harry to bow his head to Umbridge. This is the woman who used an unforgivable in front of the children. This is the woman that sent a house, based on bias, away while inviting students to fight in a war.

So, then remind me, why the fuck is Minerva McGonagall always portrayed as the voice of reason? Why does she give Dumbledore stern looks that make him cower when she finds out about his actions?

For what its worth, Dumbledore might not have been perfect but he was always there for his students regardless of their allegiance. Even Snape, if you disregard his pettiness, seem more reasonable than McGonagall. At least his detentions involve cleaning flubberworm mucus or re-writing records of past delinquents and not putting your life in danger.


** The one of those that I will give her is the stone. I think the timeline places that just after exams, so presumably she needed to mark five years worth to return them before the end of term and was really busy. Also Harry messed up by insisting that Snape was after it without any evidence rather than leading with what the centaurs had explicitly told him: Voldemort was targeting it.

On the other hand you are also forgetting book 3, both the gullible badmouthing of Sirius and declaring that Neville should be forced to sleep on the stone floor outside the common room rather than bother to update the portrait security properly.

If you think about the fact that most of Voldemort's operations were based on stealth tactics, doing something like that in public seems very outrageous so no wonder he got no trial and got sent to Azkaban right away.

The betraying of the secret +was more of+ came more with a social punishment.

***** Sirius as a kid would have been a lot rougher than most fan fiction depicts.

The prank was probably less of an isolated incident than we would like to think. Also, most of his “blood traitor” beliefs he would have had to learn and practice at Hogwarts, so he probably had some rough first impressions and impulsive words that made people distrust him.

James was definitely the only person who knew him well enough to completely trust him (Remus fell out after the prank). Even then male friendships (in the 70's) can look unhealthy from the outside. (Like the tumblr head canons of them being really careful about insecurities and mental health would never happen).

Also, I'm sure his duelling style was a bit darker than some of the Order's taste (but he also liked a muggle punch so it wasn't an indication of his allegiance).

That's what I picture when I think about canon, but I prefer fanon along with everyone else.

There's a good story where Harry and Teddy accidentally go back in time to the first war and Sirius is portrayed as aggressive and paranoid. At the heart a good person but very messed up. It's a Wip though.

You made quite a few valid points, but to say that Severus Snape is a reasonable person is folly. Take away the pettiness, and what do you have?

#+end_quote

I don't see that hair's breadth, but otherwise? We KNOW he's a villain, a murderer and a Death Eater - and yet, when he's in one-on-one situation with someone he actually admits to detesting, he manages to stick to the rules.

Students complain about Snape all the time and he's still there until Voldemort decides to remove him in a permanent fashion. Pre-book 7 Snape could have very easily abused the detention time and chances are no one would believe his victims, thinking they're exaggerating, or "Dumbledore would not tolerate that, you must be mistaken".

And yet, Snape, in a clear position of power over someone he hates and with no witnesses, manages to restrain hiumself. His detentions are boring, exhausting and, in case of flobberworm duty, disgusting. Sometimes they're even educational. But he never crosses any lines when overseeing them.

So it's a contrast: Minerva, a part of the "Good Guys" can't be arsed to be professional and do her duty (looking out for the students that are her responsibility as Head of House), while Snape, a card-carrying member of "Bad Guys", can.

Even the times he takes Malfoy's side over Harry's are better than McG. After all, he's supposed to favour Slytherin. She's not.

As Gryffindor Head of House, she's supposed to favour Gryffindor students and help them.

As Deputy Headmistress and teacher she's supposed to make sure Hogwarts is a good place for getting education and be fair to all students.

She fails both.

And I'm talking pre-book 7 Snape here, so for him to win without his "I was a Good Guy all along!" brownie points is particularly condemning for McG.

With Snape, what we see is what we get, and we're pleasantly surprised when he has opportunity to do evil and he doesn't.

With McG, we have someone who promises that the House to be a family... And then she turns around.

This is the worst take I've seen in a cavalcade of awful takes about Snape I've read on the internet. Never without a justified reason? /Really/?

When he made up a rule about books not being allowed outside? Justified.

When he attempted to poison Neville's pet with his potion and was pissed it didn't kill it? Justified.

When he verbally attacked a 14 year old girl? Justified.

When he ignored an obvious attack on a student by again verbally assaulting them? Justified.

And that's just the worst /points/ related malice. Snape is almost never justified in his petty, vindictive, childish behavior.

****** Ok. I'll admit I forgot about the books part. That was indeed stupid. However Harry only got detention with Snape three times: once when he cussed at him, then after he humiliated him in front of the class and then after almost killing a student (no matter what he did since other than Myrtle there were no witnesses) and then lying about it.

As for insults... maybe school is different nowadays because there are phones with cameras but back in my days of high school when smartphones were a rarity, teachers would freely insult us with out any consequence. The best way to deal with it was to not take it to heart and move on. Maybe that's why I'm not that surprised by Snape's behavior.

Also not true. Harry also got a detention from Snape from the aforementioned 'student was attacked then Snape verbally assaulted them' situation. And he wasn't the only person Snape consistently went after with his horrendously unprofessional behavior, so narrowing your focus down to only him dismisses a good portion of the issue.

And I'm sorry that you had to deal with people similar to Snape growing up, but it doesn't make what he did okay.

**** I would honestly be surprised if Snape gave two shits about Slytherin. The way I see it, Snape only gives points to Slytherin, because he is the Head of House. He's doing it to uplift himself, and make himself feel superior, not the House. And the only reason he's not just as awful to the students of Slytherin as he is to the rest of Hogwarts, is because of who they are related to.

Severus Snape is a cynic. He's a loathsome, horrible, hateful and sad excuse of a human being, almost without a single redeeming quality.

He takes out his hatred of a man ten years dead out on his eleven year old son, for fuck sake. So you can add, "completely fucked in the head", to everything I said above.

I simply cannot understand how people can sympathize with Snape. Sure, he had a hard life, but that does not excuse his abuse of children. Period.

***** While I am absolutely not a fan of Snape (if you read my past posts you'd see I encountered similar teachers as a high schooler), I can see how he may be misinterpreted. Ideologically he is a piece of shit and that's undeniable. However within the staff he is well-respected. He is also respected by Death Eaters and the Order alike. So, despite his lack of pedagogical skills, he's overall a decent human being. Furthermore (and this is my biggest problem with people calling him a simp or an incel), the guy fucked up and basically sold the love of his life to Voldemort. But then he atoned... he spent the rest of his life risking his life to avenge her. There was no sexual or romantic reward for him (Lily was dead so if Snape really wanted he could have his way without any resistance you know?) and he even went as far as to ask Dumbledore to keep it secret. So yeah equating a noble act with being a simp or incel just indicates how immature the person saying that is.

****** I get the feeling you're referring to that stupid scene where Snape goes to Lily's house, holds her dead body and cries. Let's get one thing straight; film Snape and book Snape are two very different people.

And did he avenge Lily, or was it revenge on Riddle for supposedly taking Lily from him? If Snape was truly 'atoning' for his sins, then don't you think he would have treated Harry a little better? After all, he was Lily's blood.

Snape was a spy, and I get that he needed to present a certain facade, but he sure did seem to enjoy causing Harry to feel miserable during their Occlumency lessons. Like the piece of shit that he is.

And no, I do not think people respect Snape the person. They respect his skills, talents and abilities, but I firmly believe they tolerate him and his presence, and just barely.

And no, Snape is absolutely not a decent human being. He may not be evil anymore, but compared to regular people he's simply an awful person. You literally just wrote he's a piece of shit, but he's somehow an overall decent human being? Make up your mind.

Snape is one of my favorite characters in the series due to his ambiguous nature but probably my least favorite type of person. His acts are noble and whoever denies that probably bases their understanding of the story on fanfiction. The guy risked his life to avenge a dead woman, and friend over all. If that's not noble, I don't know what it is.

Also Snape did not owe Harry anything. Just like people so lightly say that Harry did not have to forgive Ron for distrusting him during GoF, why was Snape forced to like the kid of the love of his life with rival? For what is worth, as begrudgingly as he did, Snape protected Harry but there's no rule that he has to be nice to him.

I will give you that she has a slight excuse in that she is chronically overworked, but that's not actually an excuse at all. It's her responsibility to ensure she's aware of dangers to kids and the idea that she's a saint and some kind of saintly badass is egregious. In my book she's a badass who'd been ruined with too many years doing her own work (which already has too much of a load) and then probably over half of her bosses again as he juggles three of his own important roles, just like a bloody lot of women in the world, frankly.

But unfortunately these mitigating circumstances don't absolve her from the failure in her responsibilities to keep her students safe.

While the point taking was sorta justified, her complete inaction during the aftermath is a Problem. The /entire house/ shuns Harry, and I remember reading that the quidditch team also ignored him and only referred to him as 'The Seeker'.

And that the only reason she did it is because Fred and George, the only students she considered disturbing enough, left the school. How can McGonagall fight against someone who has that much power?

Dumbledore isn't really in a better situation since the Ministry was able to just remove his political titles and positions just like that. So, I ask again, what was she supposed to do?

**** Nope. One of the whole points of fanfiction is to be able to reimagine canon. It always has been. If all you can do with fanfiction is stay true to canon facts, it sure would be boring, and there would be no point. Fanfiction allows fans, authors, to /imagine/ - what if it happened like this? What if Harry were sorted into Slytherin? What if he was gay? What if McGonagall had a backbone and stood up to Dumbledore? Etc etc.

Not to mention that it's all but impossible to get a group of people to agree on what any character's true “canon” characterization is anyway.

Maybe /you/ only like what you perceive as close to “canon-compliant” fanfic, but if so you're part of a small minority, as evidenced by the hundreds of thousands of stories out there in which authors allow themselves to imagine something slightly or vastly different - such as making Minerva a voice of reason in Hogwarts.

A bias that literally everyone in the books and even the author has. It's also just logical.

** Was putting Harry in the Dursley's care the wrong thing? In book five, Dumbledore admits that he knew that Harry would be abused there. It was assumably not an easy choice. But what was the alternative?

The day after the Potters were killed, Sirius Black seemingly reveals himself as a traitor and executes one of his best friends in broad daylight along with nearly a dozen others. A short while after, two (very competent) members of the order are tortured into insanity.

The narrative paints Dumbledore as clearly worried that Harry is going to be assassinated. So he hides Harry under the blood wards, the strongest protection he knows. Better an abused child than a dead one. I would argue that McGonagall did nothing wrong by relenting. Albeit, the blood protection only becomes apparent in later books, so Dumbledore's speech to McGonagall in the first chapter is a bit hollow. But that is the consequence of the first few books being purely children's books.

Harry left the house. A lot.

All it would have taken is one Death Eater going there and waiting out of sight to kill him. Instant he steps off the property, wham.

So either no Death Eaters tried to find him, they couldn't find him, or he survived through authorial fiat, because /from what Rowling showed/ there was no reason they couldn't've hit him with a Killing Curse on the way to school.
