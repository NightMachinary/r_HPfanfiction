My Potterhead friend and I are writing a Harry Potter fanfiction together. The main character is an original character I created and the story takes place about four years before Harry and the gang are at Hogwarts. There are only three short chapters of it so far but I'd like to know your thoughts on it!

Here's the link: [[https://www.wattpad.com/story/196316409-magic-a-harry-potter-fanfiction]]


** Seeing as it is on Wattpad I'm genuinely impressed that the grammar isn't truly abysmal. Look, there is a lot of wrong with this in my opinion and it is not the sort of thing I would choose to read. I've detailed a bit below but if you're just trying to enjoy yourself then keep writing and don't read what I've said. I've spoilered it so you don't have to read it if you don't want negative feedback. Even if you don't read my comments I highly, highly recommend [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/writing-advice-thread.37586/][you read through this thread.]]

I have some serious issues with this fic. If the character lived in the states I would roll my eyes and carry on but for a character that lives in the UK there are issues from the get go. In the UK it is acknowledged that mathematics is plural, notice the s on the end. As such when it is shortened it is called maths, not math. I don't think primary schools use letter based marking either but that might have changed. Only Universities use semesters, schools use terms. Skye and Jackson, these might be common in the US or elsewhere, but they aren't in the UK. Surnames maybe but as first names they stand out.

> This made Skye angry.

Show don't tell. Show me things that let me piece together that she's angry don't tell me. Show me her scrunching up her work, balling her fists, what you have done is lazy.

> /SPLASH!!!/

I don't think there is ever a need for three exclamation marks short of a four-minute warning.

>WHAT DID YOU DO?!

Again, excessive punctuation and the all caps are really not necessary. You're being lazy again. Don't tell me how to feel, show me things and let me decide how I feel.

>art professor

I don't know any primary schools that had dedicated art teachers let alone a professor. Maybe a fee-paying school but a regular primary school has a single teacher per class that teaches all their lessons. They almost certainly would not be a professor.

>Recess

Not really a thing. The UK tends to have break time and lunch time.

>saying hi

A bit lazy again. I expect better than 'hi' I don't think that belongs. Honestly if the chapters weren't so short I would have stopped there but just going to the next page I'm struck by 'fifth grade.' The UK doesn't use this. Primary schools go reception, years 1-6, secondary schools go 7-11 and then you get sixth form. Harry Potter characters are not sent their letters on their birthday. Harry got his hand delivered to him on his birthday only because he had failed to get his letter when it first came to him a week or so earlier. Imagine someone with a birthday August 30th, they'd be royally fucked trying to get their school supplies and expecting someone like Hermione who's birthday is far earlier in the year to not do magic at home for almost and entire year is daft. The address the letter is sent to is bizarre. 1604? Is that a year? What kind of street has a house number that goes that high? Take a few minutes on Google maps and look at how London is laid out. For me this fic is not written by someone who has prepared or planned this fic in any way.

*** I didn't read the op post but your criticism made me certain that I won't. I am writting a fic right now, would you mind doing this for me?

(Shamelessly asking for a beta because I need it). I currently sit at 43k words published (another 9ish ready for next week). With chapters around 5k works. Here is a link if you want to give it a read!

P.s. major au, no major divergence yet on plot.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter enters the wizarding world unaware of the dangers that lurk beneath the surface. Struggling in class, he can barely make a feather float, how can he fulfill the destiny everyone expects of him from this? His only hope in tipping the balance in his favor is to delve in the more esoteric magics. With a Harry Potter focused on divination, mind magic and necromancy.

*** Thanks for the feedback! I wrote the first chapter very quickly one day when I had a burst of inspiration, so I know I didn't do a very good job of showing not telling. About the stuff that uncommon in the UK, like I said in an earlier reply, it's hard to know that stuff as someone from the US. And, for the excessive punctuation, since it's not going to be something big and actually published, I'm going to keep it as it's just for fun.
