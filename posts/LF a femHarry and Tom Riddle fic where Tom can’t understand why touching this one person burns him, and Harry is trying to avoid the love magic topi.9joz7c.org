I mean I'm sure it's out there. But it's something that people don't really address, since the graveyard ritual would cancel the effect for old Voldemort, but it's not mentioned in time travel stories


** Can be a slash fic too I'm not picky

Topic, not topi sorry!

** I'm writing one that is kind of like this. It's a self insert with a MC that's an adult woman stuck in Harry's body. Them touching results in burning and Harry's scar hurts around Tom Riddle. I only have one chapter so far, but I'm almost done with chapter 2, which is longer than chapter 1.

*** A bit off topic:

I'm a little weirded out right now because I have a fic with a premise very much like yours sitting on my hard drive. My's admittedly more crackfic-y, but it's close enough to be one of those funny little coincidences.

(Although your username has given me pause, lol.)

Anyway, I'm always in the market for SI OC fics, so I'll be keeping an eye on yours. It seems like your fic isn't going to make things easy for the main character.

**** Hahahaha ;)

If you do post your fic, let me know!

And you're right, my main character will not have an easy time of things.

  I awoke in the body of an 11 year old Harry Potter in 1938 about to start school with Tom Riddle. As an adult armed with knowledge of what was to come, I thought I could change the future for the better. But being a horcrux complicated things, and when it came down to it, I chose survival. Also available in audio.
