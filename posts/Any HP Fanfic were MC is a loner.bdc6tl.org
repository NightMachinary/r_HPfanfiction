** The first part of the controversial fanfic For Love of Magic does this. Although it's probably not what you're looking for.

** linkffn(the life he leads). It's been taken down before when the author decided to stop writing. It's since been re-uploaded and even recieved an update or two since, but I wouldn't expect much more.

If you like reading about a boy who has social anxiety and confidence issues, the first part of this story has it in droves. I nearly dropped it because of that. There's a lot of character growth, but Harry never really outgrows his shell, even by the latest chapter.

That being said, it's fairly well written and I found it enjoyable.
