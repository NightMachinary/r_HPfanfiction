I have no love for Draco Malfoy's character in canon, but I've seen fics where he's treated as this moron who only is passing due to nepotism.

Which is odd, considering he looks to be trying (not succeeding) to knock Hermione off top of the class.

Have you seen things like this in fanfiction? What other things do you notice?

***** Fanfiction authors often look to real life examples when fleshing out their characters. Stories focused on Slytherin characters need to show how the characters can believably think of themselves as the good guys without turning them into 2-dimensional card carrying villains. The author doesn't need to justify the character's behavior, just show why the characters /think/ they are justified.

Thus, it makes sense for the authors to model their characters' beliefs off of examples of bigotry and extremism in real life.

Like how can muggles avoid wizards just apparating away? And how do wizards predict muggles when they haven't kept track of muggle tech for hundreds of years? And how do they deal with their respective population sizes, with wizards popping up in muggle families randomly but also being a minuscule population in comparison to muggles? And how do muggles figure out defenses against things like curses and and transfiguration and the like? Would the muggles ever consider using bombs, knowing that they'd likely catch a lot of British civilians in the crossfire?

How do wizards account for the copious wiretapping that was occurring during the Cold War (and still occurring later but in a more low key way)? How do they realize that a random Chinese spy was listening in on the phone call when one of Margaret Thatcher's men told America that there was a magical government in Britain? How do they realize that said Chinese spy sent that info to the CPC, who then sent it to the Soviet Union, who then started a covert campaign to figure out if there was magic within the USSR? How do they hunt down every person who was told by British intelligence when half the people spreading the information don't even know the real names or faces of the people they spoke to? And if by some miracle they obliviate every single possible person in every single government, how do they wipe that information from computers and tape recorders when they're barely aware those things exist and could have compromising info on them?

Intelligence that important spreads like wildfire between allies and enemies alike, especially in times like the Cold War, and I just don't believe the magical world understands the muggle world enough to put proper procedures in place to deal with that.

This is a misconception, in my opinion. That scene with Lucius and Draco does state that he's doing worse than Hermione, but not necessarily that he's doing better than everyone else. The scene, to me, had more to say about Malfoy's racist views than Draco's intelligence.

This happens with a couple of polarizing characters. Ron, who we have canon proof that he is a good student and fighter, gets treated similarly. Malfoy is not a bad wizard, but i don't think having him a level below the trio is out of the ordinary. He just doesn't have the canon feats that they have.

Harry drives a hundred plus dementors away in his third year, beats Draco pretty handily in sixth year, can throw off the imperious curse, and holds off Voldemort pretty well in his fourth year.

Ron used the Leviosa spell on a troll club, that had to be extremely heavy, and raised it high enough to knock out a troll /in his first two months at hogwarts./ He disarmed Bellatrix Lestrange in the battle of Hogwarts, mostly by surprise but nonetheless impressive. He beats Greyback with only Neville and escapes five snatchers.

But let's agree to disagree, I doubt either of us have time for a canon analysis. It's really open to interpretation.

Seriously though, Ron getting bashed is also kinda bad, and he got pretty much the same grades barring defense as Harry. It's actually the most substantial example, but I like Ron as a character, so it fit poorly for the discussion.

When it comes to treatment, while Hermione treats Harry better than anyone else generally, she arguably treats Ron worse than Harry does. Whether Scabbers, him becoming prefect over Harry, or Lavender. He gets a raw treatment in canon. People say how he abandoned him in Goblet of fire and deathly hallows. Only the first was really his fault, and he didn't slander Harry. The second was the Horcrux. People don't blame Ginny for the chamber of secrets.

I don't know how people can defend this... I mean, I'm sure it looks exciting on stage, but it destroys Harry as a character. He dedicated his life to bringing dark wizards to justice, even died trying to defeat one, spent his adult life as an Auror. Then he gets whipped by a teenage girl. I've seen people try to justify this through Delphini being trained by the Lestranges, but come on. The Lestrange brothers were arrested by Aurors after Voldemort fell and spent 14 years in Azkaban, unlike Sirius who managed to escape. And Bellatrix Lestrange got one-shotted by a housewife.

** Good writing means treating people like people.

Draco has been raising as a racist and pureblood supremacist, and acts like it, it does not mean he is dumb or anything. Draco is intelligent, he is also a pre-teen/teen and acts as he was taught to; we also see a little, through the books, how he evolves and changes and the weight the war has on him and, maybe, in the last two books, how he starts questioning what he was told (mudbloods are people too, and not all's perfect under lord V!). Crabbe and Goyle are probably not the sharpest tools, but they are people with feelings and Draco's friends and the produce of their education; Pansy (when we see her) is an infatuated teen. The members of the inquisition team probably ranges from the ones totally engrossed in the rhetoric, to followers that just want to be "in".

No character is simple, easy to write. FF authors are, mostly, not professional writers (and some of them see the world as black and white too). Writing a character with strenghts and weaknesses, that acts following a vision of the world that can evolve (sometimes slowly if only with age, sometimes quickly, sometimes in between), in a logical way within a compelling story, that's hard. Writing one-dimensional cliche characters is way easier.

It's not a condemnation of you or your own personal interest or your personality, because I don't know you and wouldn't really make assumptions about your personal beliefs. I thought it was a matter of the Grangers having anything but overly archaic names.

***** I'm not shipping two IRL people. I find real people fanfiction disturbing as a rule, it's creepy and invasive and I'm /kinda/ upset that you're implying otherwise.

I always took Dan and Emma used as names being tributes to the actors, not the actors themselves. At least, I've never seen it taken as IRL shipping, and if that's why you aren't fond of it that's fine, and a reason why to dislike using it.

But don't implicate me in being the opposite. I've never seen a piece of fanfiction that works off of the idea that they're identical to the actors or are in some way representations of the actors and I sure as shit wouldn't be reading it or enjoying it if I had.

Of course not. They just have the same names, in works that ship Harry and Hermione together. Total coincidence.

******* ??? I've seen it used across the entire fandom? It's not exclusive to Harry and Hermione fics. It's become something of a staple, a bit like Daphne's characterization.

I'd really enjoy if you stopped trying to misinterpret the use of names, a thing more than one person can have, as me somehow wanting to ship two real adults. I found it cute when I figured it out, it seemed like a nice fandom-exclusive bit of tribute for actors of a movie, but that's the full extent of my enjoyment of it. It's kinda gross that you seem hellbent on twisting that into something else.

** And for pity's sake, Malfoy was not a bad seeker who "had to buy his way onto the team." I went thru the books once to check, and while I no longer have the specific results, Draco was NOT a bad seeker!

In every game that we know the results of, *except* against Griffindor, the Slytherins won either every or nearly every single game. That can't happen with a bad seeker, with the game being as unbalanced as it is towards catching the snitch, even with the better brooms his team had.

No, Malfoy just used the family money to give his team an unfair advantage. Perfectly in character.

*** I think he's at or slightly above Harry's level academically. Both are good but not great at most subjects, but capable of exceeding the usual ability of a Hogwarts student when pressured. (Occlumency and the cabinet repair are good examples for Draco; resisting the Imperius Curse and casting the Patronus in Harry's case)

Neither of them are a match for Hermione, but I'd put both Draco and Harry firmly in the upper third of students. Ron is about average or a bit above, usually on Harry's level but lacking Harry's flashes of brilliance.

1. Nobody fighting experienced Death Eaters at 15 is average. Sure the kids were losing until the Order showed up, but keep in mind the general public can't be relied upon to cast a shield charm correctly. The kids were not average for their age.

2. In the gestalt that Rowling modelled Hogwarts on, early 20th century British boarding schools, just passing your school certs is an achievement. This was before modern grade inflation where every student is expected to get A's. "Exceeds Expectations" is exactly that, Ron or Harry exceeded the expectations required for an OWL in the subject. That's not average.

I'm not saying Ron is the next Dumbledore, or even the next McGonagall or Snape, I'm just saying that applying modern views of exam results to canon may not be what the author intended.
