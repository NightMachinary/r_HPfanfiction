Hi everyone, I am looking for a new fanfiction to read and asking for some recommendations. I am fairly new to fics so feel free to recommend even the most well know, chances are I haven't read them. I am not looking for anything in particular as long as the thing is finished, I hate abandoned stories. Thanks


** First off, what's your opinion on fem!Harry, slash, Death Eater pairings, place on the Dark and Gory Spectrum (fluff to mass murder), time-travel, and/or crossovers?

Secondly, could you perhaps give a couple examples of fics you've enjoyed before?

*** I am not much in fem! Harry and in death eater parings. I don't care if harry is light or dark (I enjoy both), no problem with stories full of murder and gory stuff. Hate time travel and don't particularly like crossovers. The few stories that I read and enjoyed are: Harry Crow, a Cadmean victory, Harry Potter and the rune stone path, for the love of magic, the merging, Honor Thy Blood (one of my favorites), saviour of magic, taking control, an inconvenient truth, thank you Ms.Bones, the life and times, Truth of the heart and Commentarius

**** Hmm, okay. Well, you might enjoy the Realm of Song series by Lomonaaeran. It's a bit of a weirder Goblin Harry than Harry Crow's was, but it's got a similar forthrightedness.

linkao3(16856581)

Might take a bit of work to get through the intro, but you'd probably also enjoy When a Veela Cries.

linkffn(7544355)

Maybe Daft Morons?

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12562072/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Daft-Morons]]

linkffn(12562072)

Probably Behind Blue Eyes. Gets to be a really good war story later on.

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2095661/1/]]

linkffn(2095661)

Might enjoy Elizium for the Sleepless Souls.

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7713063/1/]]

linkffn(7713063)

Possibly Runic War Warning.

  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.[ON TEMPORARY HIATUS FOR PERSONAL REASONS, NOT ABANDONED â™¡]

** Linkffn(the Snape chronicles) a canon-compliant biography of Snape from his birth to his death. Author does a great job picking up on little details and side characters in the books and making them into fully fledged out plot points. A little more sympathetic to Snape than I'd generally go for, but other times really good exploration of motivations and stuff.

Linkffn(the arithmancer) or anything by whitesquirrel. Hermione is /very/ good at math. Goes into Arithmancy as a discipline, and one of the best written final battles I've seen.

Those are my favorite long and completed ones. My shorter favorites are

Linkao3(the kids who chose themselves) My favorite in a gorgeous series of one-shots exploring what the story would look like if one little thing had changed. Author has a melancholy and nostalgic writing style that really captivates me. Also check out their series on girls and women who should've gotten a better edit.

Linkffn(I know not and I cannot know yet I live and I love) canon-compatible exploration of Luna and snape's relationship (completely platonic, student teacher). Similar writing style. Treats Snape like the asshole he is, but also a human. Best written Luna I've seen, nails the depth of her canon character.

  What if Voldemort went after Harry and Neville, and gave no one a chance to die for them? What if both Chosen Ones died as children?--There was no prophesied boy, but there was still this--dozens of shadowed young faces refusing to run, even at the very end of the world. Dumbledore looked out at his chess pieces, pawns and queens; his children and his friends; his collateral damage. He had the beginnings of a plan swelling in his chest. It would take them decades to get their hands, quietly, on every Horcrux. Tom Riddle had to think they were secret. He had to think he was safe. It would take them almost decades, but one day he would be mortal again. These dozens of faces--they were mortal now. Alastor Moody could feel mortality in the aches of old broken bones; Andromeda rewrote her own last name. Remus and Sirius felt empty, gaping holes in the seats around them, and they made crude, expansive, joyous toasts to friends' memories. When Molly first reached over and held Arthur's hand, they knew this was something that could not last. That was why they held hands, held on, held tight.
