  The second volume, Black Genesis, was nominated for the 1987 Hugo Award in the Best Novel category, but of the five finalists, it was voted in sixth place, after "No Award".

** The Pius Dea religion from the Star Wars Expanded Universe (now Legends). It took hold of the Republic around 11,000 years before Episode IV. The religion was based around human supremacy, and many crusades were fought against the other species of the Galaxy.

*** Of all the fictional religions that exist, this was not one I was esxpecting to find here. Especially since the Pius Dea are a relatively obscure part of Star Wars Legends lore.

** Harry worshiping Slaanesh would be very hard to recognize. After all pride, self-indulgence and lust were not really valued by canon Harry, who was conditioned from infancy by Dursleys to feel inferior and worthless (which resulted in Harry not really grasping value of his own life and his unfortunate tendency to self-sacrifice himself unnecessarily).

#+begin_quote
  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete.
