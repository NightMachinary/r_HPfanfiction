Like... /*doors open*/ */STUN!!/* GoF always seemed a bit /too/ set-up, if you know what I mean. I'd love to read a fic or two where the book is bashed to oblivion through the magic of parody.

Thanks ^_^


** This one bashes the first six books through the power of parody that's actually funny. Made me and my girlfriend laugh so hard we cried.

  Chronicling Dumbledore's never-ending and sometimes desperate attempts to fill the Defense Against the Dark Arts position with anyone but Snape and Snape's persistent attempts to land the job anyway.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

** Doesn't even need to be a parody - just one character from a few (Dumbledore, old friend of Moody, Harry or anyone else looking at the Map, Snape realizing Moody's drinking each hour) has to drop the idiot ball insted of holding it for the whole book.

  COMPLETE. The odds of temporal displacement were tiny, too infinitesimal to count, and yet... The Harry Potter luck striking again, he supposed. So now there's an older, wiser, more mature Harry (well, the older part's true at least) stuck in the past. And he's determined that if he's going to change things, he'll have some fun doing it. (OR: Time travel minus angst equals this.)
