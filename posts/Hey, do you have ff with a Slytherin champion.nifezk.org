I would love to read a fic where a Slytherin dies in the graveyard and The Slytherin house is outraged, scared and split between those who realise that Voldemort does not care who you are, will kill you anyways and want vengeance for their fallen brother and those who still stand with him.

Thanks!

** Shameless self promotion: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18922177/chapters/44920867]]) (story also, with a few more chapters, on FFN)

It's not the main plot, though. Draco goes back in time and, knowing that Cedric would die, keeps him from entering his name.
