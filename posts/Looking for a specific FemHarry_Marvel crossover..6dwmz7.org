I don't remember a lot about it. FemHarry travels to another universe. Luna and her husband work for SHIELD and FemHarry was their nanny for a while. That's all I remember. I don't even remember if I liked it.

  Harry's first failed case as an auror causes her to end up in an alternate universe where 1) magic doesn't exist and 2) some people don't understand what it means to stay dead. Steve just wanted to help clean up the mess left over by the Chitauri invasion. Harry and Steve becoming friends wasn't a part of either one of their plans. Fem!Harry, BWL!Neville, eventual HP/SR.
