I'm going through and saving basically every fic I've ever read, or might want to read, and there's one that I can't remember the name of.

I believe it's only on one site, and it's not hosted on fanfiction.net, ao3, ficwad, or hpfanficarchive. The site requires an account to view mature stories, at the very least. The story is a Harry/Luna/Ginny one, and I think it starts with a scene with Dudley running into Luna and Ginny after the end of the story. The author had a good amount of Harry/Luna/Ginny stories, I think.

The name of the story may have had garden in it, but I'm not sure.

Thanks for any help you can give me.

Found it: [[http://mujaji.net/repository/viewstory.php?sid=173][Back to the Garden]]

*** Antosha's works are worth the hunting. Some of them used to be cross-posted on the Quidditch Pitch, before it went defunct.
