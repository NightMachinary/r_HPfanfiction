I'm working on a big FanFiction project which the bases of it would be a Harry that isn't skilled per say but a hard worker I wanted Harry to train as a martial artists and to later bring a new sect of wizards into the wizarding world. I would like to know what would be the advantages and disadvantages of being a wand wielding wizard in contrast to being a wizard that is trained in martial arts, and why one would consider one over the other? I don't want Harry to be a god sue so I want to balance it very well in the HP verse.


** Damn, you meant martial artist in your title. I was getting pretty excited about finding a fic where Harry was a Marital Artist who is some sort of counselor for married couples that are having relationship problems.

Back on topic, I guess one of the biggest advantages to being trained in martial arts is that wizards would learn to be more aware of the environment around them and that might help them when they are ambushed or attacked.

** How familiar are you with martial arts? Not being snarky, just really make sure to do your due diligence on whatever form you choose, especially because it can be v. immersion breaking when an author chooses say taekwondo and then proceeds to use chinese or Japanese terms.

Also, if you pick an Asian form, please don't do something condescending about how Azns are sparkly and superior to the West.

In terms of mixing magic, and advantage over wizards, might I direct your attention to Sining sa pagtatanggol, or Filipino martial arts, based on self-preservation, and with a great focus on knives and on improvisation, e.g. turning household items into weapons. I think that kind of situational thinking could be very useful against wizards thinking about fighting revolving around magic.

Hope your writing goes well~!

** 'Martial Arts', while usually associated with Asian unarmed fighting, is actually a term describing skill at warfare including the use of personal and siege weapons. You can include, then, the use of swords, axes, chains, shields, grenades, and anti-personnel mines along with unarmed striking, grappling and throwing in that category of training.

But should you?

It's a break from the themes of the source material to make it all about physical combat, and the few references in the original works didn't make mention of technique; the brawl at the bookstore, Hermione being choked by Millicent in their Defense class duel, Hermione slapping Draco, the animated statutes in the Ministry Atrium, and the Battle of Hogwarts were all focused on the causes and outcomes rather than the techniques.

That said, there are a number of creatures in the wizarding world that are highly resistant to spells, so thinking in terms of physical effects of wand work becomes necessary.

And then there's [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tueller_Drill][the Tueller drill]], which basically says someone charging with a knife can overcome a person armed with a handgun, if they start close enough, and that's further away than you would expect. Add in the time for prior thought and movement necessary to cast a spell compared to point-gun & squeeze-trigger, and physical combat can be very relevant and dangerous to the wanded wizard.

** The first thing that popped into my mind: Avatar. Aang and Korra use martial arts to work incredible magic in that series and if you let yourself be inspired by Bending I can see the whole thing being at least somewhere close as powerful as wand based magic.

**** Then go for it, I'd say. It certainly is a great magic system and some of its aspects, like bloodbending, are extremely powerful tools.

Plus, with the use of Avatar Bending you eliminate the danger of appearing ignorant towards real life martial arts, which can easily break immersion for many people.

** So are you saying that Harry would access his magic through martial arts in lieu of wand magic? Would he have a wand at all?

Up until fairly recently, I would have said that a Hogwarts-style wizard would win hands down, but since it's been confirmed that powerful wandless magic is canon, the jury is sort of out on that one. A wanded wizard is still going to be infinitely more versatile, because magic isn't just about combat, but neither was Shaolin Soccer, I guess.

*** I was thinking of since he wouldn't be good at wand magic maybe getting him another focus or could have him use wandless magic. But doesn't it take years of training to actually become good at wandless magic?

**** Well, it presumably entails a comparable learning curve to that of wand magic, otherwise schools like Uagadou would have designed a curriculum based on the European model(s).

** Wanded/Focused Magics:

1) Easier use of powerful magics and bolts of magical energy.

2) Access to wider arrays of magic and elemental attacks and defenses.

3) Deeper or better or just larger access to magic

Martial Arts Magic:

1) Magic rather than being focused out ward, focused inward increasing physical abilities

2) the small amount of outward magic is by Telekinetic pushes and pulls.

3) are weaker, more shallow, smaller access to magic due to all the focus on their physical training

** In the nicest way possible please be careful. This sort of thing has the potential but also potential to go off at a tangent we don't need and get so wrapped up in its own world you forget about the story.

Onto trying to help answer your question, how many wizards ever fight in their lives, or at least outside of Hogwarts? Wand magic at Hogwarts prepares you for exams and later life. Anyone extensively trained in combat centred magic would likely have drawbacks in domestic life. Work out in your head which is superior and show not tell, its an interesting idea but we don't need constant reminders of why its so brilliant like we see in some H HG fan fiction where the writer constantly feels the need to justify themselves. If wands weren't the best why does everyone including Dumbledore use them? Another warning and this is from a balance perspective. Have you watched ip man? Cool movie, now have you watched the Indiana Jones movie where the sword guy does some cool shit then Indy just shoots him. If you make this magic too complicated or slow then your character just dies. If they don't die you've cheated, if the magic is for all intents and purposes identical to wand magic then what's the point? Don't be the guy/girl who thinks that not being able to ride a broom well or something like that means your character is balanced. If not being able to cast a cheering charm is the only drawback to your system why doesn't everyone use it?

*** I see where you're coming from, I wanted it to be cool without having to needless explain it all the time. The whole which one is better and why most Western wizards in Harry Potter uses wands vs wandless magic or any other focus is what I'm looking into now.

** So essentially he would be the equivalent of DnD Monk vs. a DnD Mage? It might be good to take a look at the differences there, because they have some really detailed weaknesses and strengths laid out in those guides

**** Yeah, it sounds exactly like them. A DnD Mage uses external flashy magic, which can be incredibly powerful, but a Monk uses 'Ki' as an internal magical energy to power up their manipulation of their own bodies. It also opens up the possibility of expanding on the different types of native magic in the world you want to build, by suggesting that in the far east it is known that you need to train your internal magic to allow you to do incredible things

** You almost want to establish a history of wands and a separation point. In Britain we have legends of Merlin and the like, do some searching in legends. Greek gods had symbols of power, tridents, lightning bolts etc we these the first wand like foci? Is a staff a form of wand? A wand is a very practical and versatile shape so it might well have been refined down to that. Ollivanders as a family have been selling wands since 382 bc. Did something happen around then?
