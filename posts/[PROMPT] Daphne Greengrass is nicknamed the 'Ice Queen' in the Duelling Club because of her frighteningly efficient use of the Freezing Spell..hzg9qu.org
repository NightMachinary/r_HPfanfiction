Basically, Daphne's favoured element when fighting is ice and it gets her this nickname in-world with zero affiliation with the 'romantic' trope.


** And she sings:

#+begin_quote
  My power flurries through the air into the ground

  My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around

  And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast

  I'm never going back

  The past is in the past!

  Let it go, let it go

  And I'll rise like the break of dawn

  Let it go, let it go

  That perfect girl is gone!

  Here I stand

  In the light of day

  Let the storm rage on

  *The cold never bothered me anyway!*
#+end_quote

I can totally get behind this "Ice Queen" Daphne, and her sister "Anna" Astoria.

*** I mean Astoria did apparently have a curse on her that caused her health to slowly fail.

****** Yeah. It's pretty good up until the talk about Cedric really gets going. I like the idea of Albus being slytherin and being shunned because of it.

****** 90℅ of the stuff that's all right is from Scenes 1-5, which is a darn shame because that's just patheticly almost nothing.

*** Daphne: "Just stay away and you'll be safe from me."

Astoria: "Actually we're not."

Daphne: "What do you mean you're not?"

Astoria: "I get the feeling you don't know."

Daphne: "What do I not know?"

Astoria: "Hogwarts is in deep, deep, deep, deep snow..."

Daphne: "Actually, that's kinda normal for this time of year."
