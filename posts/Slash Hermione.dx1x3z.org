I feel like female slash doesn't happen often? Or at least well-written, solid and not just PWP. Hermione/Ginny would be preferred but honestly anything that is well-written.


** I run a HP femslash review and recommendation blog if you'd like to get regular updates on good complete fics. You can follow the blog on Tumblr or Instagram!

Hermione/Ginny is probably one of the most prevalent femslash ships in the fandom. I can recommend you a bunch of good long one's one I get home from work (my computer has my spreadsheet list XD)

  Ginny and Luna haven't spoken much since Ginny abruptly left Harry and separated herself from most of her old life. Luna is busy working in Diagon Alley, eager to earn enough money to move out of her father's house and see the world. Ginny--fresh off a suspension from the Holyhead Harpies--has returned home and is dissatisfied with having to take two steps back in her life. She asks Percy if she can stay in the spare room in his and Oliver's flat. The trouble is, he's already offered it to Luna...

**** I agree that well written anything is always possible, but femslash /is/ harder to write for HP compared to other fandoms. It has nothing to do with the characters themselves, just that JK Rowling is awful at writing female friendships/relationships. There are only 3 female friendships that have any canon basis: Luna & Ginny, Parvati & Lavender, and Marietta & Cho (my secret favourite HP femslash ship).

You'll notice I didn't include Hermione & Ginny; that's because in canon, the only true mention of their friendship focuses on Hermione encouraging Ginny to go after Harry. Not Bechdel approved.

Compare that to male/male relationships, of which there are many. The marauders, the enmity between Draco & Harry, how much more developed Snape is than Mcgonagall... The fact is that the HP verse is kinda male-centric, despite being written by a female author.

***** Yes this, entirely. I finished reading the Throne of Glass series earlier this year, and those books are rife with femmeslash possibility, not to mention the pretty much "gay-unless-stated-otherwise" situation in the new She Ra cartoon, whereas there's very little in the way of personal interaction we see between women in Harry Potter.

I remember really looking forward to seeing who the new "female professor of DADA" was going to be before the release of OotP, and as much as Umbridge was a great villain, I was disappointed that she was what we got. She's also the woman who causes the most friction among the other women in the series, but she's just so two-dimensionally unlikeable on the page that the fandom isn't exactly chomping at the bit to write her into romances.

******* That's true that it makes it harder if you want to stick true to canon, but I love stories that show how things could have been between the woman of the HP series. Showing moments between them that we never got in the stores and building your own headcanon's around them.

Millicent's a great example of this. The fact that she puts Hermione in a headlock suggests that she has some muggle heritage (it's not a move I can see any aristocratic pureblood pulling), despite the Bulstrodes being listed as part of the sacred 28. That gave me the idea of writing her as a halfblood in my fic and also being able to write her as butch as well. Her lack of canon background let me build her character up in a way that suited the story I wanted to tell and to give her the kind of traits that JK denied her characters.

  Harriet Potter died at one year old. What was left of her slogged through life, alive in body and mind but not soul. Six years later she was finally cremated. This is not the story of Harriet Potter. This is the story of the brilliant flame who inherited her place, and her journey in the strange world of humans.*****Harriet is trapped, surrounded by humans, and painfully easy to extinguish if she doesn't keep her flames hidden. After the Dursleys, Hogwarts is a step up for her, but now she has to unravel the mysteries surrounding the body she stole and fight to survive against a monster who may be even less human than she is.One by one, Harriet's friends will find that they are playing with fire, and the price of failure is greater than they ever could have known.

  Why can't you plan relationships the way you can plan your career or write a legal brief? And how could she possibly be a late bloomer? Hermione is always ahead in every way, thank you very much. A Hermione-centric coming out story.

** I seem to remember thoroughly enjoying linkffn!(yule ball panic by philosophize) and its sequels. Its Fem!Harry/Hermione.

Fair warning, it deals with homophobia as a central theme in the sequels.
