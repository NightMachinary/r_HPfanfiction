The melancholy nature of The Smiths' lyrics and their older sound really reminds me of the Marauder Era and so I want to read some fanfics set in this period. [[https://youtu.be/KbuGWgYLqWk][Asleep]] is what really makes me think of Sirius, James, Lily, Remus etc... that time period must have been depressing to live in with the First Wizarding War going on and thousands being killed and so I want to read a fanfic that reflects this melancholy mood.

I don't mind time-travel.

Slash is okay as long as it's not the focus of the story. James/Lily preferred. NO HAREMS OF ANY SORT!

I prefer completed fics or WIP please.

I really want to see realistic characters that don't fit into the cliches we imagine the characters in the Marauder Era to fit in, i.e. Lily being Hermione 2.0, James being an immature prat until Lily takes pity on him, Sirius being a womanizer, Peter being shy and a punching bag for everyone else, etc...

These were real, brave people living in a terrible time and I want to read a fanfic that develops in this way if possible lol.

I already read linkffn(The Life and Times)

Thanks in advance

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days.

  After a prank gone too far, Sirius Black realises that things have to change. He never wanted to follow the path of his parents and the realisation that, in certain ways, he was like them wasn't good. His life from there on took another direction. One person certainly found this new Black heir very interesting.

  She was dramatic. He was dynamic. She was precise. He was impulsive. He was James, and she was Lily, and one day they shared a kiss, but before that they shared many arguments, for he was cocky, and she was sweet, and matters of the heart require time.

** My favorite Marauder-era anything is [[http://mugglenetfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?sid=83718&warning=5][I'll Pick You Up, by MagEd]]. It's delightfully mysterious, and very.. darkly written, I guess? The romance is also pretty good.

It was also the first fic I read, and I still really like it even after all these years. I give it a re-read every year or two.

The only downside being that it isn't on FFN or AO3.

You could try my story linked below (on ff). It's the Whomping Willow prank, but very character-focused and with a lot of bubbling ideological tension.
