It's the only time travel fic I would want to read, honestly.

I cringed so hard at the "most brilliant witch" Minister Hermione keeping a Time Turner in her office bookshelf. Also making out with her Polyjuiced nephew, what the fuck was up with that.

**** It's already happened, according to The Cursed Child, which JKR made canon.

The Cursed Child also has such interesting plot points like:

- Voldemort and Bellatrix had a baby two months before Bellatrix was killed at the Battle of Hogwarts.

- Cedric became a Death Eater due to embarrassment in losing the Triwizard Tournament.

- The snack vendor on the Hogwarts Express is a Terminator with cyborg knife hands, and multiple students knew about it.

- Harry was so upset his kid was sorted into Slytherin that he said, "I wish you weren't my son".

- Hermione's happiness is dependent on being shacked up with a man. If she hadn't been married to Ron, she would have turned into a bitter, hateful shrew who gives up on her life ambitions.

And much, much more!

  *Albus:* What is your name?

  *Trolley Witch:* I've forgotten. All I can tell you is that when the Hogwarts Express first came to be --- Ottaline Gambol herself offered me this job...

  *Scorpius:* That's --- one hundred and ninety years. You've been doing this job for one hundred and ninety years?

  *Trolley Witch:* These hands have made over six million Pumpkin Pasties. I've got quite good at them. But what people haven't noticed about my Pumpkin Pasties is how easily they transform into something else...

  */She picks up a Pumpkin Pasty. She throws it like a grenade. It explodes./*

  *Trolley Witch:* And you won't believe what I can do with my Chocolate Frogs. Never --- never --- have I let anyone off this train before they reached their destination. Some have tried --- Sirius Black and his cronies, Fred and George Weasley. ALL HAVE FAILED. BECAUSE THIS TRAIN --- IT DOESN'T LIKE PEOPLE GETTING OFF IT...

  */The Trolley Witch's hands transfigure into very sharp spikes. She smiles./*

  *Trolley Witch:* So please retake your seats for the remainder of the journey.

Didn't Harry at some point (epilogue?) say that it didn't matter to him what House his kids were sorted into? What changed his mind? Or do I remember that wrong?

****** The authors of the play don't give a fuck about JKR's original characterisation (or anything about the original canon), as long as they can make something superficially dramatic or make for interesting spectacle. That's why the play has a Death Eater Cedric, Daddy Voldemort, Incestuous Hermione, and Incompetent Comedic Relief Ron that is closer to the movie version, and LITERALLY doesn't know which end of his wand is the right way around.

One of the worse parts is how it's not only Harry being upset about his son Albus Potter going into Slytherin, but the extended family of the Weasley family being upset too. Albus' cousins shun him for being in the "evil" house. It's like the play authors learned nothing from the original series...

... It's like they never even read them.

****** Nothing changed his mind. Albus being sorted into Slytherin wasn't what Harry was upset about or why he said what he said.

Albus was a spoiled a little brat, Harry tried connecting to him by giving him something from his parents (the baby blanket he was left in), and Albus mocks the present and starts mocking Harry for being the poor orphan. He then wishes Harry wasn't his father, and Harry snaps and says it back to him. He regrets it directly afterward and tries to talk to Albus.

I'm trying to think of a moment in the play where Harry was mad about Albus being a Slytherin, and I can think of nothing. He tells him to stay with Gryffindors in the AU where Albus is truly a Gryffindor. He tries to keep him away from Scorpius because he's warned about a dark force around his son, and he doesn't know Albus made a new friend that was the true dark force.

****** The play has time travel in it, and in one alternate "darkest timeline" stream, Cedric is alive and joins the Death Eaters, kills Neville before Neville can get to Nagini, and Voldemort wins.

This is despite all the Time Turners being destroyed in OotP, but apparently someone invented a new type of Time Turner that can go back 20 years, and doesn't rely on fixed time loops like the Time Turners of PoA canon.

Again, so many things break canon, so if you were going to nitpick one, you might as well throw the rest of the play in the bin.
