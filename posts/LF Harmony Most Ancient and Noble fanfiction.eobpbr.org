Must be Harmony with or without Harem and have Harry be the heir/head of a Ancient and Noble house (one or more, doesn't matter). And must be COMPLETE or updated regularly. I realize that with [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]] i can usually search these but not every story containing these has Hermione in the character list no do they have the status of any of the Most Ancient and Noble houses within the title/description so i'm looking for stories who might have this that i have missed. Harmony doesn't even have to be the main pairing but Harry must be with Hermione in the story at some point. Please comment your suggestions~


** By the way, i do not care about bashing personally so post those stories away~
