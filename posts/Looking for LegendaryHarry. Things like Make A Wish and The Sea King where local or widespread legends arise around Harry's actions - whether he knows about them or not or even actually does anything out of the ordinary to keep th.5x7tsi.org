***** /Basilisk-Born/ is obviously the worse-written fic. Bashing, poor writing, basic grammar errors and LARP dialogue seriously let it down. And I was never convinced by that ridiculous 'firbolg' nonsense.

However. /Basilisk-Born/ manages to capture something that /A Long Journey Home/ never quite got. A sense of mystery, a legend gradually unfolding and a world continuing to evolve. I think the main difference is that /A Long Journey Home/ reveals too much at the start. We simply learn too much about Jasmine, who she is,where she went and what she can do, which drains the sense of a legend unfolding.

TLDR: /Basilisk-Born/ is objectively a horribly written, bad Fanfic. But it gets full marks for atmosphere and story-telling, which, at the end of the day, is what matters.

****** I think /A Long Journey Home/ needed to divulge too much at the start in order to get reader buy in to the story. You had to understand the world and /who/ this character was before getting to the real meat of the story. If it had simply started with "Female!Harry gets blasted back in time" then the next chapter was the Merlin-arc it would have been hard to take seriously. This one builds you up into why you should care about the stories going into the past, in my opinion at least.

I also think, however, that the author had a rethink on what they wanted to do after the first couple of chapters, and probably got their hands on /The Once and Future King/ somewhere after starting. There was definitely a tonal shift pretty quickly.

Need to reinforce this recommendation. Most female!Harry stories are literally a dime a dozen, but this one is on a completely different level. It's not just a good female!Harry story, it's a good story in general.

Basilisk-born has loads of very obvious grammar/spelling errors which are repeated throughout as well as the teenagers playing Downtown Abbey tone to it. Still is a decent read if you don't mind the manipulative Dumbledore trope
