** Linkffn(The Power The Dark Lord Knows Of)

The Power of Love works, but it's not enough. The Prophecy was pretty vague about what the mysterious power it mentioned is, but the Dark Lord doesn't know it. So what happens when he knows about the Power of Love?

** Searching for the Power? I'm not going to link it because it is NSFW but the basic premise is that Harry, Hermione and Ginny start a relationship where they try to get Harry together with as many people as possible because of the “power of love”. Super! Harry Harem fic but one with good characters and interactions.

It's on FF.net if you want to find it.
