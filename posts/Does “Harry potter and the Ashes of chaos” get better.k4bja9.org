** I've kept up with the chapters so far but I have to admit that it's starting to get really stale and it's slowly but surely falling into the generic WBWL fics already out there and the OCs are kind of annoying. I'll probably stick around for a few more chapters but I'm not hopefull

**** It's pretty much tied between Antithesis or The Green in the Grey

*** Yes it's kicking up now this plots going on in the background it's just taking awhile to get geared up cuz it has all the ground work to be very different than a lot of other FanFictions

** I don't know. I read until around chapter 19 and it was still eh. Pretty generic and boring. The only reason I managed to read that far to the fic is because it might've been Haphne pairing. (I know it's as generic as the fic but hey, I didn't choose to love it) but instead it looked like it was just a random OC. Until chapter 19 I can say pretty confidently that it's just any WBWL ever. That's at about the end of year one I think, and I saw that year two is waaaay longer, so maybe the characters develop into something more interesting that the typical Slytherin group and It becomes more of its own thing rather than being Slytherin smartass Harry doing the canon stuff. AOC is like the 4th Slytherin Harry that I've read that just follows its brother to go get the stone instead of just doing some new fun plot for the first year. It probably doesn't change, don't read it unless you want a Harry/random OC that isn't mentioned for like 50k words until the author decides they need to start bonding a bit more.

*** Do you have any recommendations for a fic that does everything differently in new and diverse ways?

**** I remember enjoying Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux quite a bit, I don't remember if it was good since I read it like 2 years ago but it does change a bit more the stuff, still not completely new plot but the idea behind is just so much more interesting. Not WBWL though, and I'm pretty sure it had slash correct me if I'm wrong, but it wasn't really romance Harry just was manipulating the guy, I don't think they even kissed. If you want a more unique Slytherin!Harry try that, I'm sure I have read better stories that fit more with what you're looking for, but that's all that comes to my mind right now.
