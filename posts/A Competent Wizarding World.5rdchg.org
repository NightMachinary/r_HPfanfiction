** Eeh...you can't really have a competent wizarding world. The place has to be stupid and corrupt so that Harry can end up taking on Voldemort himself again and again, create and justify plot twists, et-cetera.

You'll notice that in every book, Albus Dumbledore is somehow out of Harry's reach during the climax; a ministry summons, being removed as Headmaster, can't stand in the way of the Ministry (so he advises Hermione & Harry on how to do it instead), Harry is portkeyed away...and in the 5th book, Dumbledore's appearance is what puts an end to that book's Voldemort fight. Again, this is precisely for the sake of the plot; it needs to be Harry who fights Voldemort, not Dumbledore.

Similarly, the Ministry of Magic is rife with pureblood supremacism and stuffed with Voldemort's followers, because otherwise they'd be too effective in fighting the latter. Which would mean, once again, that the spotlight is taken off Harry.

That said, I've thought a bit about how to have a competent wizarding world, and the answer would essentially be to have the various magical races as equals, being represented in an elective Wizengamot.

Hogwarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry would instead be Hogwarts School of Spellcraft (again, with all kinds of races), wizard prison would be about rehabilitation rather than rule-through-fear...you could still have the pureblood supremacist movement, but they wouldn't be entrenched in the government.

** - Dumbledore wouldn't hold 3 positions of power because there is really no way for one man to do all that work and do it all competently.
- Dementors would not be the guardians of Azkaban.
- All ministry employee's would be required to take oaths similar to a Hippocratic Oath but instead of "do no harm" it would be more in line with "do not be corrupt".
- Wizengammot would have to do the same as above.
- Hogwarts teaching staff would have to do the same as above.

That's all I can think of.

Do you mean a magical oath? Risking your magic, let alone your life, on a statement made in the English language (or any language really) is insane (think about what lawyers can do to the English language). How is corruption defined? Is it the oath-takers personal defintion of corruption (which can be rationalized to anything), or is it based on laws (which can be rewritten by the Wizengamot to anything /after/ you've taken your oath---for example, you might find yourself /required/ to assist Umbridge's campaign against muggleborns without the ability to quit)? For one such exploration of the idea, try the first chapter of linkffn(Knowledge is Useful, But Power is Power by DisobedienceWriter).

Requiring people to take magical oaths turns them into slaves.

**** Because the Wizarding world is tiny. We can't comprehend a single person being the attorney general, the U.N. delegate and the Dean of Harvard because that would be insane. Buuuuut.

Higwarts is tiny, 7 year school is smaller than some high schools in the U.S. that are only 4 years. The books make it clear that Dumbledore rarely does anything at the school, because there isn't usually a need for him to do anything. Mostly it seems he just lives there and takes care of issues as his staff brings them up, barring his attachment to Harry.

The Wizengamot likely meets infrequently due to the size of the Wizarding population. Most likely it's a once or twice a month commitment and Dumbledore doesn't seem to need/want to sicilia to further his position, his power comes from his reputation unlike Malfoy' which comes from schmoozing.

The I.C.W. likely meets even less frequently barring some kind of emergency.

I'm talking about the Ministry and Gringotts, not Hogwarts. Both of them should be able to afford security good enough to stop 3 teenagers.

AK47s are banned for civilian use, but that doesn't mean that you can just bring one to Capitol Hill. It's even worse for wizarding britain because there are a seelct few buildings that are part of the government that should be protected.

And Gringotts is the major bank of Britain. Security shouldn't be an issue.

*** The issue with Dementors is that they are conventionally unkillable. Yes, they may be able to starve to death, but consider the logistics of locking them away. They are semi solid beings, and therefore would be able to work their way through a solid prison. Normal materials have issues, because they would constantly drop below freezing. Dementors degrade magic and magic users, acting like a sponge for it. If you fail to imprison them the first time, you only have one spell which can be effective against them, and they are able to hunt and kill among the population, breeding all the while. The fact of the matter is that Dementors are the natural predators of Wizards, and unlike humanities predators, Dementors have a degree of intelligence and there is no advantage that the Wizarding World could hold over them.

It actually has some similarities to our problems with nuclear waste. Hideously dangerous, not a pressing problem, and the solution isn't good enough to go forth with.

#+begin_quote
  Wandless magic exists, from Snape and Quirrel cursing Harry's broom to Grindewald in FB. Every wizard can teleport, some can change into animals, some can fly and others can change their looks. Hagrid is a half giant with enough strength and magic resistance to escape from multiple aurors. Can you imagine trying to jail beings like this without the dementors? This is the reason why there are no holding cells in the HP universe, because wizards can escape when given half a chance.
