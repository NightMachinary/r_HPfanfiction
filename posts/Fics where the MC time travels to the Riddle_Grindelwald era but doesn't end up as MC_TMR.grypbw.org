** Unfortunately, very few:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5492188/1/Doubting-Thomas][Doubting Thomas]], linkffn(5492188): Time traveling Luna raises Tom Riddle. This one shot is great!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12331839/1/Realignment][Realignment]], linkffn(12331839): Dumbledore protects Tom Riddle from a time traveler.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9561455/1/Spectrum][Spectrum]], linkffn(9561455): Time traveling Hermione kills Tom Riddle in his orphanage and many more.

There are a few more incomplete ones:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13088810/1/Carpe-Noctem][Carpe Noctem]], linkffn(13088810): Voldemort time travels to his Year 6 and decides to do things differently.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13013582/1/In-the-Bleak-Midwinter][In the Bleak Midwinter]], linkffn(13013582): Time traveling Hermione hooks up with Tom Riddle Sr.

  One Shot. AU. After all, every child deserves a mother who loves them. Even those who grow up to be monsters. Luna just never imagined things would turn out this way. Time Travel.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

  When Voldemort died at the Battle of Hogwarts, nothing had prepared him to reawaken as Tom Riddle circa 1943, rid of his madness but left with a gnawing sense of defeat. Things may have gone wrong the first time around, but Tom vowed not to let the course of history run unchanged. He could do better, and this time... no one would stop him.

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7525570/1/Here-And-There][/Here And There/]] Ginny and Hermione travel back in time to WWII, around the time of the Grindelwald's Wizarding War or some time after it?

** I suggest using AO3's robust tagging system, to search for time travel fics, with whatever tag they use for WWII or Grindelwald and exclude any pairings with Riddle. I'm afraid I can't offer any specific suggestions, as I mostly focus on fanfics that depict alternate stories during Harry Potter's era.

** The majority of HP/AD fics are time travels to Riddle/pre-Riddle era, also a decent chunk of HP/MMG. Can't really suggest any because I never liked one enough to bookmark it, but searching for those pairings on FFN should pop up a lot of them.
