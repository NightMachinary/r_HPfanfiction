So, I was reading With Strength of Steel Wings by AngelaStarCat, and without getting too bogged down in things a situation arose were you had someone who could travel great distances easily, and a werewolf. There solution was to dump the werewolf in an uninhibited forest. Which got me thinking.

Why not just ignore night time for the day? If you can travel that distance easily, then why not just go to the other side of the world, then back after 12 hours?

So I started to think, what do we actually know about apparation in cannon? Distance, limits etc etc. The same with floo or portkeys. Could Lupin for example just ignore full moons once a month? Is there any fic that you know of that does this?


** The longest apparition distance we know of is from Hogsmeade, somewhere in Scotland, to Tom Riddle's cave on the south coast of England. That's probably in the region of 400 miles (~640km).

For reference, the distance between London and Paris is 214 miles (344km).

Moreover, Harry was able to do the same journey in return, with a passenger, the same year he learnt to apparate. So it's not a super special Dumbledore-only thing.

We have to reconcile this with the fact that Voldemort flew between Nurmengard (likely in Germany or Eastern Europe) and England. Even if he couldn't apparate directly all the way to England, surely he could have apparated once he flew within range (i.e. when he reached France or Benelux countries). But he didn't: we have Harry seeing him flying over water through the scar connection.

One explanation is that Voldemort just loves flying, but given the urgency of the situation this makes little sense. I think the only way to reconcile the two facts is to say that there are other factors contributing to apparition than distance.

I can think of two potential explanations here:

1. Large bodies of water block apparition. This is an elegant solution, fits with mythology which JKR will have been aware of, and also nicely explains why the war with Voldemort never really spills over to involve the continent or rest of the world. Britain is relatively inaccessible to wizards. It also explains why wizards apparently largely left the New World to the Muggles to explore. The downside of this explanation is that it means that Europe, Africa and Asia are all apparatable, unless you bring in other limiting factors.

2. Magical geography is not the same as physical geography. The idea here is that what determines apparatable distance is not physical distance but rather "magical geography", some kind of extra dimension in which, for example, Australia may be closer to Britain than France is. This fits nicely with the conceptual nature of HP magic, where a beetle is easily transfigurable into a button simply because the words are similar. Britain and Australia's shared language, culture and history could make apparition between them easier.

*** What a well thought out answer, I really like the water solution, it has always been kind of a grounder of water. Plus other magical creatures, vampires for example. I think this is now my head cannon.

*** Personally I think apparition works in a straight line and you pass through solid materials but only a limited amount of it. Therefore you are distance limited by the curvature of the Earth.

** I think one reason Lupin/ Werewolves may not do this is because of international law/treaties.

My uncle has AIDS and tried to visit China in the 90s. They went through his bags at the airport, saw his medicines and made him take the next plane out of the country.

Lycanthropy is treated as a similar stigmatized disease in The Magical World and so traveling out of the country all willy nilly may not be allowed by other governments. (Or even by the government of the magical UK. There are some restrictions on werewolves, and maybe this was one?)

Some countries may be more liberal in their policies, but many could still see it as a “keep your diseased folks out of our yards, thanks.” Especially on the night they can transmit their disease more easily.

I have no idea about apparition limits though. I do imagine that there are things like customs and magical boarder control too, which probably should be obeyed.

** Like a lot of things with HP, JKR never really expanded on these ideas. To expand would mean to explain and then we would get to the nitty gritty of why these things don't make any sense.

Like anything, if you wanted to establish Apparition distances or traveling to the far side of the world to avoid the moon, make sure to establish the rules your story. As long as it fits within the rules of the story and doesn't offensively contradict canon (everyone's an Animagus!), create giant loopholes, or make it too convenient for the protagonist(s), then I think it can be executed.

** Yea I agree. With lupin I read a story before where harry is so rich he hires a jet to keep lupin moving around the world in the sun so he never has to turn around the full moon time. As for apparation. We know in canon people like Dumbledore and harry can apparate long ass distances. So why can't lupin apparate to the Arctic where they have the sun up 6 months at a time? I don't know.
