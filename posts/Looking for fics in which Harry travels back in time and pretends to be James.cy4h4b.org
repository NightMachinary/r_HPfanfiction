I just read a fic with a concept I really enjoyed - an adult Harry travels back in time to the beginning of the books, but not by possessing himself - he travels back body and all, and ends up pretending to be James to start making changes. Unfortunately the fic isn't all that long - it's marked complete after getting only to the Sorting. I'd love to see some others with a similar premise.

The fic in question is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19267840/chapters/45822457][Double Back by Methos2523]].


** The fic is only marked complete on ao3, not ffn so there still is hope for the author to continue it.

I do agree that I haven't seen this idea besides this fic and hope there are others that explore this idea.

  AU. On that night, Neville Longbottom was the child that You-Know-Who marked as his equal. Surprisingly, Longbottom lived through He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named's Killing curse. Fourteen years later, the Boy-Who-Lived and Harry confront their destinies.
