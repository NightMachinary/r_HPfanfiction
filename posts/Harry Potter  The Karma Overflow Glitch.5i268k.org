"Oh crap!" One of the angels whooshed into his chair and started typing at something resembling a computer.

"What's up? Did someone make a deal with a devil?" One of his co-workers asked.

The first one shook his head, "No, no, it's one of the great humans, Harry Potter! He used a time travel device to go back to his own past and it's causing a glitch!"

The second shrugged, before sliding over to his own terminal and typing into it, "Harry Potter. Commonly known as Boy-Who-Lived. Wrongly famous for Voldemort aka Tom Riddle's 'first' demise, see file 1752D0G Lily Evans, but successfully caused Voldemort's true death. Update in progress, see Incident Report FHD634. What kind of glitch?"

The first sighed, "Alright, so, look at Harry's personal karma history. He started off fairly neutral for karma, but he had a heap of multipliers; dead parents, mean relatives, madman out to kill him, bit of evil soul in his head, and of course that he was young."

"And?"

"The problem is, check Incident Report BKD3472! Because there was a bit of Voldemort's soul in Harry, and Voldemort has like the worst karma ever, Harry wasn't getting the benefit of his karma, it was just building up and up and up..."

"Oh, that explains the crap he went through at Hogwarts. And also how he beat Voldemort for real, that was when he was just free of the soul bit and had loads of good karma to spare, right?"

   :END:
The first angel nodded and turned back to his terminal, "Right! But now Harry's gone BACK in time to his own 11-year-old body! And he just did some sort of ritual to remove the horcrux from his body, so now we've got a two-souled Harry Potter with a massive amount of leftover karma and all the multipliers intact!"

The second blinked, "But won't that solve itself with a few bursts of ridiculously good fortune? A winning lottery ticket blowing into his path?"

The first buried his head in his hands, "That's the problem. It won't. Harry's karma pool is so big now that when his karma is recalculated after every good thing that'll happen to him, it'll actually increase!"

"Like a multi-trillion-dollar bank account where try as you might, you can't spend more than you're getting in interest." The second one commented sagely.

The first looked up, "You have no idea how accurate a simile that is. That Einstein guy wasn't kidding when he said that compound interest is the most powerful force in the universe."

Harry scratched his chin and pondered. Something very strange had been going on lately. Sure, he appreciated the lottery wins that quadrupled the size of his Gringotts vault (even if he didn't buy any tickets), and the growth spurt and instant muscles brought on by a burst of accidental magic were welcome, but the hordes of men and women following him around and praising him as their lord and messiah (some not even human, some clearly from another world) was starting to bug him, and if he had to be honest with himself, he much preferred his old snowy owl animagus form to his current weird phoenix/nundu/hippogriff hybrid thing.

He was just heading into Eelops Owl Emporium to reunite with an old friend, when there was an explosion and the entire room was covered in powder snow, causing the various owls to squawk.

There, in the center of them, was a magnificent white Snow Phoenix, who turned her head and nodded, /Harry Potter. Most exalted one, your mere presence has unlocked my true form./

Harry raised an eyebrow, "Hedwig?"

/If that is what you wish to call me, let it be so./

Harry sighed. How was he going to find and destroy all of Voldemort's horcruxes with so many /distractions/?

*** Everything was going peachy until the planet suddenly exploded under Harry's feet.

Or:

Harry's amazing luck suddenly took a turn for the worse as Hedwig developed an inexplicable case of diarrhea while perched on Harry's shoulder.

The sight sent various Slytherins at their house table into hysterical laughter, which triggered bursts of accidental magic from each of them, which washed over the hordes of Harry's worshipers, squeezed into the Great Hall with him.

Slowly, those worshiping eyes turned to madness as a wire in their brains was crossed just the wrong way by the magic, and Harry's followers suddenly charged at the Boy-Who-Lived with their bare hands, wands, knives, arrows and laser guns.

In the resulting 'kerfuffle', Harry lost several teeth, several fingers, both of his unmentionables, one of his eyes, and got something rather unpleasant tasting in his mouth.

Flailing around, desperately trying to escape, Harry's own magic accidentally activated, combining with the residual chrono-energy from his previous trip through time, opening a space-time rift in the Great Hall.

** 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section-2
   :END:
Dozens of innocent people were torn apart by the rift; somehow, this counted as close enough to 'murder' for Harry's soul to fracture, and residual energy from the horcrux meant that bits of Harry's soul went flying everywhere, turning dozens more survivors in the Great Hall into horcruxes.

More importantly, however, Harry himself, far from being torn apart by the space-time vortex, was cast back millions of years into the past...

Harry groaned and slowly opened his eyes, squinting at the bright sunlight.

"Uh...okay, what just-"

~NOM~

He was promptly eaten in one gulp by a Tyrannosaurus.

And then a certain meteor landed on the Tyrannosaurus, blowing up everything for miles around and burying Harry's chewed up and pulverized corpse deeep below the earth.

This wasn't quite the end of Harry, however, because he still had a connection to his accidentally-created horcruxes in the future.

This meant that, fully conscious, his spirit was buried deep, deep underground, with very little ability to move the packed earth around him.

/The next few million years are going to suck.../ Harry thought to himself.

***** I wonder if there might be a fic of a horcrux-user being buried underground for millions of years after being banished to the past, and being dug up by random chance.

I did pose a similar possibility a little while back with dinosaurs having developed their own magical civilization before humans...

****** It would be pretty awesome as an antagonist, voldemort gets kinda boring over time but having a dark w/lizard ragemonster stomping everywhere and threatening the statue of secrecy just because he's not aware that it exists would be pretty interesting.

It would probably be treated more like a natural disaster than a dark lord but seeing many wizards coming together to defeat the threat would be interesting.

Dark lord T-rex could totally break into the dragon reserves in romania and build a powerful dragon army against the wizards. Harry is immediately drafted to fight because he defeated the last dark lord and he understands what the lizard is saying because of his parselmouthery.

Maybe horcruxes are a reptile thing because everyone who used one in the past seems to speak parseltongue or has some sort of affinity to reptiles, iIrc Herpo the foul was a dark herpetologist or something like that.

** HAHAHA

Love it! A great idea.

Btw, are you archiving those mini-fics somewhere? I'd definitely fave a one-shot story where you post these mini-fics.

** Just pasting this at the top of any terrible overpowered Harry story instantly makes it not suck! This is amazing!\\
Now I kind of wish this was a whole story I could read. Where so many ridiculously good things happen to Harry that it kind of unsettles him :-)
