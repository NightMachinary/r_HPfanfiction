I want to see stories where Harry isn't the BWL. Neglect is not preferred, but I'd read it. And I don't mean WBWL, I mean he just isn't the BWL.


** The Pureblood Pretense series has as female Harry where there is no prophecy and no boy/girl who lived. It's an AU where Riddle gained political power rather than forming the Death Eaters.

*** Definitely one of my favourites. Even though the plot follows some of the broad strokes of canon, it feels like a whole new story, perhaps because there is no "Voldemort trying to bring himself back to life" plot. Harry has a wicked sense of humour, usually of the deadpan snarker variety, after growing up in a home full of Marauders, and she works really hard for her goals - although she's clumsy about interacting with her friends, treading on toes without meaning to.

The way it expands and explains the world is really well done, too, whether it's delving into the effects of combining different potion ingredients, discussing what differences there really are (and aren't) between pureblood and first-generation magic, or something as simple as Professor Lupin turning the Boggart into a broader lesson about recognising fear in yourself (from any source) and working through it.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

  AU. On that night, Neville Longbottom was the child that You-Know-Who marked as his equal. Surprisingly, Longbottom lived through He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named's Killing curse. Fourteen years later, the Boy-Who-Lived and Harry confront their destinies.
