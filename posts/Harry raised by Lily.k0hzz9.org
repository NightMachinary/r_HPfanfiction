:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
In this fic Harry is raised by Lily alone because James cheated on her with another woman, got the woman pregnant and married her. I could have sworn I read it recently, but I can't find it. Am I crazy? What fic is this?


** Any chance it's linkffn(I'm Not The Only One by Potato19)

*** I slogged thru the first five chapters of this. So far it's Doormat!Harry in One Tree Hill's reincarnation of a Hogwarts. I can guess that One Tree Hill ness of the story will persist but question is, does Harry grows a back bone at some point?

** There's linkffn(Lily fixes a mistake) but I assume the fic you're thinking of was gen (Lily-wise at least), and in that case I cannot help you. Sorry!

  JK said that, given a second chance, Severus would pick Lily. I'm giving Lily a second chance to pick Severus, instead. AU, of course. Some deaths, too.
