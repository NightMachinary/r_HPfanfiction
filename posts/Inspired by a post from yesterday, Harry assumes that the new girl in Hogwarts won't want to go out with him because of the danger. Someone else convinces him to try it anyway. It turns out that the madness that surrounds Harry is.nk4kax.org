#+TITLE: Inspired by a post from yesterday, Harry assumes that the new girl in Hogwarts won't want to go out with him because of the danger. Someone else convinces him to try it anyway. It turns out that the madness that surrounds Harry is a slow week for her.

I just really want to see eg: the Ministry battle and everyone's a little bit shaken after apart from this one girl who just gives zero fucks because compared to people constantly trying to kill or kidnap her it's nothing.

** Sounds like it should be a crossover, just a question of which girls from other settings would work. Buffy Summers comes to mind, though she'd have to be from earlier in the series just to be Hogwarts age.

***** We do unfortunately, the two extra days are called Wulliesday and Brusday. Wulliesday was only added recently, commemorating Oor Wullie. It was a ploy by the Clydeside shipyards in the 60s to save money and maximise profit by making their workers work the new day, but pegging their wages to the international standard week.

Brusday has a convoluted origin. Folk Etymology would say it's named after The Bru, since everyone uses it to recover from getting mad wae it at the weekend. However, this is not the case. The day is named in honour of The Bruce, and dates from the Protestant Reformation when The Kirk of Scotland banned Christmas. The Kirk used Brusday as a replacement alongside Hogmanay and the 2nd January. As a result, Christmas wasn't widely celebrated, at least officially (People may have celebrated privately but it wasn't a public holiday) until the 1950s.

******* Aye, I made most of it up. The bit about the Kirk banning Christmas and stuff though, is entirely true.
