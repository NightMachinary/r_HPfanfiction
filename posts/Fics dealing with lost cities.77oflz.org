Like Shangri La or El Dorado or Atlantis or Iram of the Pillars or Libertalia? By which I mean they are actual places that get visited, not just metioned like "Oh yes they were a thing."

Basically Harry Potter meets Nathan Drake/Laura Croft/Indiana Jones. ^{^{I've}} ^{^{been}} ^{^{playing}} ^{^{Uncharted,}} ^{^{shush.}}

please and thank you


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time) the entire fic revolves around Atlantis. In linkffn(Bungle in the Jungle: A Harry Potter Adventure) they go dungeon crawling into a recently lost city filled with inferii.

**** Be sure to give its sequel, Turn Me Loose a read, if you haven't already. I definitely thought Bungle was the better of the two, but Turn Me Loose has some really fun parts in it.

***** Yeah I read Turn me loose as well and agree while it doesn't have all of the magic of the original it is still a worthy successor. Bungle in the jungle reminds me a lot of Make a wish, I'm struggling to find more to read in that genre.

****** The rest of jbern's stuff is good, if you haven't read that yet. A Black Comedy is, imo, one of the best comedies out there.

Isn't that by Nonjon?

The lie I've lived is great too though.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

** linkffn(9993319) is a bit of an unusual fic, and you or may not like it, but it involves a lot of travelling to different places/times and exploring them (e.g. poking through pyramids for treasure). It's /sort of/ a main focus of the fic, but I can't remember how indepth it's covered beyond the first few fairly good exploration scenes.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5609522/1/Atlantis-An-Adventure]] - Warning, Hermione/Voldemort. I liked it, but I prefer her other fics, where Hermione is a bit older. This one is an interesting adventure, but the relationship part is definitely a big part of it and I prefer the way the author wrote about them in other fics (Shared Flame is my favorite, but no lost cities)
