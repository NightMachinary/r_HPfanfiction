Is this a secret agent tasked to single-handedly destroy Voldemort's forces? A hunter sent to dispatch an entire colony of nundus? The leader of a task-force sent to stop Dark!Super!Harry?\\
Worse; it's a teacher intending to survive their first year teaching DADA at Hogwarts, and return for a second year. Possibly even third.

What happens at the end of this teacher's first year on the job? What kind of mysterious things happen to them on holiday? What happens the first time they set foot inside Hogwarts for a second year teaching?

(P.S. Yes, the DADA curse is present. Although you could write about the first person to test for the curse after Voldemort's fall and being sufficiently paranoid about it.)


** The teacher has finally made it. They are about to teach their first class of their second year teaching DADA. First teacher to accomplish this feat in 15 years. They are so happy to see their students again.

Five minutes into the class, not a single student has shown up, but it's first years, so they probably got lost.

Another five minutes pass. This didn't show up last year.

They look around outside and see a sixth-year student that they knew very well from the year before.

"Hello"

"Oh, professor, it's great to see you again. I'm really sad that I won't be in your class this year."

This makes the teacher pause. The student has always gotten amazing marks on all the work.

"Can I see your schedule?"

The student hands them the time-table.

No DADA.

"It's so weird" says the student, "nobody seems to have your class, even though we passed the DADA OWL."

​

​

After talking with Dumbledore, it seems that the magic forgot to put DADA on any timetable.

"I'm afraid that the curse might be real. I am terribly sorry teacher, but the students need to learn. If you would like to leave notes for the next teacher I will be happy to pass them on for you."

The teacher sighs. "I'll start packing, sir."

Dumbledore looks sad. "It was very brave of you to try. That's the most Gryffindor thing I've ever seen a Hufflepuff do."

*** Huh...that reminds me, in canon, Harry didn't restart the DA after 5th year. Are informal DADA classes affected by the curse too?

Edit: LF Fics where Harry tries to restart the DA and is affected by the DADA curse.
