LF some Slytherin Hermione, or ones where she breaks the usual mould. Not too concerned about relationships, but I would like it if her change in personality is explained somewhat by circumstance etc and not just randomly OOC.

Preferably complete, but if not then so good it's worth the wait.

Thanks for helping me break the quarantine boredom! :)


** Have you read [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]? It is a super science AU and she is technically sorted into the Gryffindor comparable house, but it is very clear from early on that she is not really a Griff and she becomes more Slythering as the story goes on.

** Hermione is a Slytherin in my series, which is a WIP currently in fourth year. It's sitting at about 220k words, and focuses on politics and worldbuilding. The first in the series is linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn).

I also have two new fics I've dug out of my google drive, one is a pureblood Hermione fic where she discovers in sixth year that she's Bellatrix's daughter, linkffn(Purple Like Violets by Flye Autumne). The other is a Hunger Games esque AU where Voldemort is victorious in his initial defeat of the Potters, linkffn(Requiem by Flye Autumne)

  In 1981, Lord Voldemort was victorious in Godric's Hollow. Fourteen years later, he rules Britain with an ironclad fist. Each year, young witches and wizards compete in Requiem for a place in his inner circle. When Hermione is chosen to represent London, she's forced to use every one of her skills to succeed - or die trying.

** Linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology) fits the bill. Hermione is quite similar to canon Hermione, until she realizes how Muggleborns are treated in Slytherin and she adjusts appropriately.

It's abandoned unfortunately, but definitely worth the read.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means.

  Hermione Granger is special. She's always known it, really, even before she received her letter that informed her she was a witch, and even before she could do the little tricks that kept away the bullies and left her time for her books. It was too bad, of course, that she had never met anyone quite as special as her, but she was hoping that would change now that she was going to a right and proper school for witches and wizards.And she wasn't wrong, because the moment she laid eyes on Harry Potter she just knew he was very special indeed.

** I don't know where the name comes from, but linkffn(Six Pomegranate Seeds) has the fabric of reality breaking and killing everyone when Harry defeats Voldemort, and the mind of Hogwarts sends Hermione back to intervene, filling the hole left by someone dying to the Killing Curse. In this case, that means that she becomes ten-year-old Cathal Rosier, about to start Hogwarts.

What particularly stood out to me was how hard she works to keep her distance from Harry and leave history unchanged until the time she needs to act. As one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight, though, she can't help but have a lot going on in her own life, and a lot of eyes on her. She has to do a lot of concealment and a lot of lying, sacrificing whatever it takes to be ready when she needs to step in at the final battle.
