Are there any Marriage Law fics that are told from the perspective of either; a happily married couple or someone who, rationally, gets the hell out of that country.

When I say a 'happily married couple' I mean people who where wed before the whole thing started so there isn't any angsty drama between them about why it happened.


** Told from the perspective of an assassin that Harry hires: linkffn(2612901)

  This is my response to the Marriage Law challenge after hearing about it and reading some stories... and thinking about what MY reaction would have been if I was Harry. Oneshot, complete with epilogue.

*** Is an assassin out of character for Harry? Yeah. Still...

Thanks for the recommendation!

**** Harry is not the assassin. He hires someone to be. It's short; and definitely worth the read
