Context - I'm presently preparing to begin writing a story where Voldemort raises Harry.

Now when Ronald gets to Hogwarts, he'll already believe all Slytherins are slimy and evil pieces of shit. At points during the story (as presently outlined), him, Seamus, and Dean will confront Harrison and his yearmates (mind you, we're talking over a dozen of them on most occasions) in the hallways. Such behavior already reeks of stupidity, but for comic relief. In your opinions, how often can Ronald Weasley do this before realizing it is a stupid, pointless endeavor? How far is too far? How often can you do this before it doesn't become funny anymore?

EDIT - You guys all make some very good points. +1 to some of you guys.


** Confronting people in the corridors between classes isn't in-character for Ron. Ron hated Malfoy more than anybody, but can you name a single time when Ron actually started a fight with him? Both Ron and Harry were bullied by Slytherins throughout their time at Hogwarts, and they only reacted to that abuse.

Malfoy was the one who instigated confrontations. He would call Hermione the magical-equivalent of nigger, or insult Ron's family, or try to torment and sabotage Harry. Everything Ron did was in response to those things. He never went looking for trouble, or sought out Malfoy to fight with him. Ron was always on the defensive.

And this is Malfoy we're talking about. Ron /hates/ Malfoy, and Malfoy /deserves/ that hatred. What could Harry do in your fanfic that could possibly make Ron hate him more than he hated Malfoy in canon?

In canon, Harry was way more biased against Slytherins than Ron. Harry whines about them every year, but Ron only makes a couple of comments over the course of the books. I think people are confused by the films, which give Ron some anti-Slytherin dialog on the train that originally belonged to Hagrid.

I think fanfic writers want their Slytherin protagonists to seem sympathetic, so they turn the Gryffindors into arrogant jocks and turn the Slytherins into misunderstood Goth kids who get bullied at lunch. 9 times out of 10 it's Ron who becomes the most arrogant and cruel bully, but in canon he's very humble and chill.

I understand the necessity of having student antagonists for your protagonist to wrestle with, but do we really need /more/ out of character Ron bashing?

I mean, Fred and George are far more likely to bully somebody. I love them, and they weren't bullies in canon, but they're far more likely to seek out mischief than any other Gryffindor, and they aren't afraid to fuck with people in creative ways. Remember what they did to Umbridge? Or when they enchanted snowballs to attack Quirrell? Or that time they pushed a student into the vanishing cabinet? If they think you deserve it, then they won't hold back. Ron is purely reactive and defensive, while Fred and George take agency in belittling the people they don't like.

I'd also say that Hermione is more actively malicious than Ron. She disfigures Cho's friend, traps Rita Skeeter in a bottle for weeks and does some petty shit in her 6th year. Unlike Ron, Hermione actually /plans/ to do cruel things; Hermione is ruthless when it comes to her sense of justice. Ron (and to a lesser extent, Harry) is only cruel impulsively or accidentally.

And I don't say this because I hate Hermoine, or Fred and George. I love these characters and I don't want to see them bashed. However, they're the only major Gryffindors who would actively seek out confrontations with their rivals.

And let's be honest, if your Harry was raised by Voldemort then a mere above-average classmate like Ron wouldn't pose much of a threat, would he?

**** You're probably right. It only accrued to me after I wrote that post that Fred and George are responsible for Ron's phobia of spiders.

I imagine that if we saw the series from the perspective of somebody who wasn't their good friend we might not love them as much as we do. For example:

#+begin_quote
  George Weasley: "Half our year had minor breakdowns coming up to OWLs. Tears and tantrums... Patricia Stimpson kept coming over faint..."

  Fred Weasley: "Kenneth Towler came out in boils, d'you remember?"

  George Weasley: "That's 'cause you put Bulbadox powder in his pyjamas"

  Fred Weasley: "Oh, yeah, I'd forgotten... hard to keep track sometimes, isn't it?"
#+end_quote

I doubt Kenneth Towler thinks highly of them.

Also, it always seems like Fred is the twin that takes things too far. He was the one that turned Ron's beloved teddybear into a spider, and he was the one that tried to trick a young Ron into making an Unbreakable Vow, and I think he was the one who pushed that Slytherin into the vanishing cabinet. Also, it was Fred that wanted to blackmail Bagman, while George was against it. I haven't read many fanfics that showed any difference between the twins, but perhaps that's something worth exploring.

*** You have to remember that the entire series is written from mostly Harry's point of view as well. The whole story is filtered through his take on the world. The result is that there is very little informative on other supporting characters and that statements like "Fred/George are just vigilantes" and "Malfoy deserves it" are subjective at best. Harry may THINK those things based on his observations and that's all we can say.

If the series was written from Dumbledore's POV or Snape's POV or even Crabbe's POV we'd be all thinking different things.

Remember how everyone hated Snape after book 6 was released but suddenly he gets a massive fandom after book 7. That's the result of reading a novel written in such a way.

Ron could secretly be a Genius and just acting average for all we know. It would explain how he's good at chess.

**** I get what you're saying, but it's a bit of a stretch to imply that Malfoy was just misunderstood. His actions were very indefensible, even if his feelings are understandable, or even sympathetic. Not everything is black and white, but not everything is a shade of grey either.

Also, Ron is above average. He scored the same as Harry on his Owls, except in DADA, which means he got E in all core subjects. Remember, Harry, Ron and Hermione were the only students in all of Gryffindor that managed to get into NEWT Potions; in total I think it was only 12 kids across their entire year. Ron also must have gotten an E in Charms, DADA and Transfiguration in order to continue into NEWT courses, as evidenced by Mcgonagall telling Neville he couldn't do year 6 Transfiguration because he only got an A. His results are even more impressive when you consider that he took his studies the least seriously of the trio, and he had a fucked up second-hand for his first two years of education. He's not a genius like Hermione, but Ron isn't an average student either.

Instead...hmm, perhaps think about your basic assumptions. /Why/ does Ron believe that all Slytherins are bad, who or what influenced him to think that way? Are his family responsible for raising him that way, did a gang of Slytherin alumni bully him when he was younger, did he research Salazar Slytherin's beliefs and Voldemort's claim of descent from Salazar and use that to come to his conclusion that Slytherin is the 'evil' house?

More to the point, why does your Ron feel it necessary to confront your Harry? Is he challenging the Boy-Raised-By-The-Dark-Lord to gain prestige within Gryffindor house? Does he want vengeance for some earlier slight? Does he feel weak and/or persecuted and is trying to boost his self-esteem by bringing down the wonder boy? Does the poor Weasley just want to shake the rich Potter/Riddle down for a few Galleons?

Ron independently discovers the room of requirement (or maybe just an abandoned project in an unused part of the castle). He would normally be a dumbass about such things but his schoolwork is lagging behind and he tries the room for a way to get caught up on school without having to study.

The room presents him with a Pensive and a memory library. The memories are the first two years of Hogwarts from a Slytherin student in the 1700's.

Unknown to him this Pensive is dangerous because it's a student project from the room of hidden things that the room of requirement is presenting to him. This Pensive doesn't show you memories like a normal pensive. This one integrates memories as if you lived them yourself. They essentially become your own experiences. After the first session shoves two months of memories into him Ron knows it's a bad idea. However his classes make more sense and his homework is just a bit easier so he keeps doing it because it's effortless.

At the end of second year from his perspective Ron has been a Slytherin as long as he's been a Gryffindor.

Unfortunately, this sub is fairly divided on /when/ that line is drawn. When does it just become boring and stupid, instead of comic relief?

  When writing a stupid Ron Weasley - how far is too far?
#+end_quote

Any far, because Ron isn't stupid:

- Stupid people don't get good at chess.
- Stupid people don't defeat a spell-resistant troll with a seemingly benign spell they had learned earlier that day. (Harry, you might recall, chose to utilize /his/ wand by sticking it up the troll's nose.)
- Stupid people don't get OWL grades at least as good as Harry's in everything except for DADA.
- Stupid people don't manage to sneak and/or fight their way out of a group of Death Eaters after having their wand taken.

The idea of targeting the troll's club with a levitation spell and then using it as a weapon against it is not an obvious one and is evidence of intelligence and creativity.

*** - Chess is a game. It can be learned. Many smart people are bad at chess and many good chess players aren't that smart in their life.

- Ron Vs Troll. Well it does kind of proves that Ron was smarter than troll. So now we kind of know that if someone makes him as dumb as troll than he has gone too far.

- Harry was an abused boy who never did good in studies. His school life was a tug of war between two old, bitter men.

**** - General intelligence is, with very rare exceptions, necessary for being good at chess. That not everybody who is intelligent bothers to get good at chess is irrelevant.

- In that scene, Ron was smarter than Harry or Hermione, neither of whom thought to target the troll's club with a levitation spell, despite having been shown to be at least somewhat more talented at picking up new magic.

- JKR almost certainly intended for Dursleys' abuse of Harry to be literary equivalent of inconsequential cartoon violence: they are the "evil stepparents" of a fairy tale. For that matter, when Hagrid tracks down the Dursleys in PS, we get this exchange, so no, it's not true that he "never did good in studies":

#+begin_quote
  ‘Do you mean ter tell me,' he growled at the Dursleys, ‘that this boy -- this boy! -- knows nothin' abou' -- about ANYTHING?'

  Harry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after all, and his marks weren't bad.

  ‘I know some things,' he said. ‘I can, you know, do maths and stuff.'

***** - Probably this held very true before AI. Computer programmes are programmed to play chess at different levels. Yes! Intelligence is necessary. A troll won't be able to play. But Chess can be learned and you get better at this game with practice.

- Well of course someone whose intelligence you measured by comparing him to troll is ... I don't know. So a troll got knocked out because a club that he was swinging so easily with 1 hand... It wasn't even heavy. Even a human won't be knocked out by it. Let's accept it as plot armor and move on..? Anyway! Every time Ron said something mildly sensible Hermoine looked at him with 'Wow! Even you can be smart' face. At the last war when ROn said something intelligent and Harry-Hermoine looked at him funny he said something like "Oh come on. Even I can be intelligent from time to time".

- Doesn't prove that Harry was good at studies or worked hard for it. And certainly doesn't change the fact that his school life was utterly destroyed by different people for different things.

Since we are talking about JKR and her intentions behind why she did certain things certain way how about we talk about why she created Ron? He was sidekick to Hero. He was created as a dumb(er), comedy relief.

From Oxford Dictionary:

  Intelligence - The ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills.

So, yes, you learn chess. And that's why they require intelligence.

****** - Since Ron didn't have access to an AI (unless "living chess pieces" count, but then, everyone has access to an AI), what's the relevance?
- Why do you insist on comparing Ron to the troll? In that scene, the troll didn't have a wand, but Harry and Hermione did, yet neither of them thought to do what Ron had done.
- It proves that Harry is at the very least not a bad student, not in any way ashamed or reluctant to show off his knowledge even in front of the Dursleys, and so isn't particularly crippled in this regard. His and Ron's OWL performance is significantly above average, and very similar, which makes sense since they probably studied together and put in comparable amounts of work into their classes. Anyway, I think that you may well be the first person in the fandom so eager to degrade Ron that you are willing to degrade Harry to do so. :P (Well, maybe some particularly fanatical Hermione fans do...)

As for the interview, the word "dumb" does not appear anywhere, and "comic" only appears in reference to Neville, so I don't see where you're getting this.

** Well if on a scale of 1 to 10 7 is the highest range of what anyone could take seriously outside of a crackfic, then Champion's Champion would be a 10, possibly the only 10. Just use that as your guide and note to yourself that if you ever get even close to the characterization in that fic, you've gone way farther than I figure you'd want since you're asking.

** Harrison? Come on is a little bit of creativity too much to ask? :(

As for Ron? I myself don't like him, so I'd probably go all out (frankly I think he's a useless waste of space and Harry would be tons better off without him - sure he's usefull sometimes, but even a broken clock is "usefull" twice a day!)...not actively going for bashing, but showing him in a negative light (which is damned easy! He's not good at school, he looks like he stole his clothes from a dumbster (sorry, Weasleys, but maybe you should have stopped after Percy?), he doesn't have any hobbies (ok: Chess and quidditch, which he's bad at..."Weasley's our King!"), he eats like a somewhat trained (he uses fork and knife I think) monkey, he's prejudiced and narrow minded (he frankly is a poor immitation (get it?) of Draco Malfoy, just in Gryffindor!)

** For reasons given, I don't think Ron would seek them out. I do think, however, that the twins would /push/ Ron into confrontations, so that the view is that he is doing just that, but really it's a long-standing prank.

I think, with enough careful clue dropping, by the third occasion I'd want to understand the joke, after which it needs to be dropped outside of crackfic.

Ron could even arrange to join up with Harrison (btw, Harrison? Really? It seems very American to me. Unlike, say, Harold or Harald or Haralde) because, while the two basically detest one another, Ron /is/ a chess player and may see a need to team up for a very, very limited and specific alliance to a mutual, very temporary cause.

You can have meetings and confrontations, but unless Harrison wanders into Ron's range, sneers and then the confrontation starts, the answer is none. None times.

** I wonder if there is a fic out there somewhere, where Ron confronts Harry that he's a slimy snake, and Harry just outrights kill him the ''muggle'' way, and hides the body in a random broom closet. And then walks away with a little evil smirk while his emerald avada kedavra coloured orbs shines with glee of having finally rid of a filthy weasel.

Since he's not using any spells so there is no 'magic signature'(I guess?) and goes of scott free.

Also Isn't there a fic where he tortures/kill death eaters the 'muggle' way so they couldn't idenitify who murdered them?
