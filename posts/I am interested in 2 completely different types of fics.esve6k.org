Are there any fics where A. Harry becomes a DADA teacher at Hogwarts after the war

Or

B. Hogwarts has its own fanfic community and the people that know about it write fics about students and teachers alike

  The war is over, so where are Harry and Ginny now? Harry's finally settled into a position that's made for him, and Ginny is thriving as a chaser. Life is normal. Life is good. All is well. A one (maybe two) shot on where Harry and Ginny are post-war, inspired by a tumblr post and its responses.

  How do Harry and his friends cope after the Battle of Hogwarts? What becomes of Teddy Lupin, the orphaned godson of Harry Potter? This is my version of what could have happened after the final chapter of Deathly Hallows, covering the 19 year gap that there is between then and the epilogue. There will be love, hurt, weddings, angst, and drama. I hope you enjoy my story.

** Oh I know this one fic. So good. Shame it hasn't been updated in a while. Doesn't end on a cliffhanger though, so that's always welcome.

  At twenty-five, Harry Potter is at a crossroads in his life. He's achieved his dream of being an Auror, but it's not all it's cracked up to be, and with one child and another on the way, he's missing out on precious time with his family. But being an Auror is all he knows how to do - right? So he's in for a surprise when Professor McGonagall, Headmistress of Hogwarts, offers him a job as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher ...
