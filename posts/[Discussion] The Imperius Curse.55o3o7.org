It's probably the most powerful spell in the HP Universe. Just imagine the case where you put both the Presidents of US and Russia under it and order them to fire all their nukes. This thing is world-endingly powerful.

So my question to your writers is: Do you place restrictions on the Imperius Curse, and if you do, what kind of restrictions?

I personally can think of the following:

- Only one actively controlled victim at any time
- Distance reduces the effect
- Passage of time reduces the effect
- Strong willed persons can throw it off, either immediately or after some time
- Existence of magical artifacts and items that can render wearers immune
- Casting it requires physical proximity, for example less than 10 meters


** How about, you can't "chain" them (one Imperiused person Imperiusing another). Pretty sure I've read a fic where Voldemort put some Ministry worker under Imperius, with orders to put others under the same curse. It just makes it even more OP.

*** Though in HBP, Draco chained the Imperius on Madame Rosmerta, and had her use the Imperius Curse on Katie Bell. So Draco used Imperio on a witch to Imperio another witch. Though it should be noted that Rosmerta and Katie Bell are not particularly powerful so maybe Draco just got lucky that those two were weak.

If Draco can have chain the Imperius Curse, then the likes of Voldemort/Bellatrix/Lucius/etc would be able to do it even better than what Draco did in canon. Though its seems to be implied that the Imperius Curse is harder to use than the other Unforgivable Curses just purely for the continuous control over a victim the caster can have without needing to be directly around at all times.

The only real limitation to the Imperius Curse seems to be that the victim can resist it if they have a strong enough will, and said resistance can come at ANY moment. Meaning that a dark wizard could get screwed over if their Imperiused victim breaks free from control at a crucial moment like in GoF when Barty Crouch Sr broke free of the Imperius Curse and almost got away entirely if he wasn't killed off by his son. If Crouch Sr had got to Dumbledore in time, everyone would know Crouch Sr was under the Imperius Curse and therefore it would change the entire endgame of GoF.

Another weakness in canon is that if generally speaking, it is possible to tell if someone is under the Imperius Curse just by looking at them in the eyes, assuming the Imperius Curse was poorly done. If a dark wizard puts someone under the Imperius Curse, and then its found out later that the victim is under the Imperius Curse, then it destroy the entire point of the Imperius Curse.

Though really, the Imperius Curse is only really OP when used against muggles since muggles cannot resist the Imperius Curse, since the entire resistance of the Imperius Curse is a magical thing. Even then, the only muggles that would be worth putting under the Imperius Curse would be politicians or monarchs, which could easily backfire if it ends up breaking the Statute of Secrecy.

*** In case USA and USSR/Russia, I'd like to think their Magicals have been colluding with their national governments ever since WW2. Their key organizations, such as KGB, CIA, and Federal Reserve, have significant presence of Magicals. Roswell and Area 51 were not caused by Aliens, but were results of secret collaborations between Muggle government and Magicals.

In Europe, Magical establishments towed the orthodox ICW line and went back into segregation. As a result, British and French colonial empires fell apart quickly, and lost their superpower status.

Strangely enough, Muggle governments who benefited from their collusion with Magicals were just as eager to maintain the SoS, because they saw it as a key competitive advantage and essential to national security. Violators of SoS in those countries would not only face their own Ministries, but intelligence/security services of their own Muggle governments.

** For me, aside from the canon limitation of it being able to be resisted, the only three things about the Imperius Curse I ever include is:

- The Imperius Curse does not grant the victim any increase in skill from their controller at all, no matter how much direct control the caster has over that victim. Otherwise Voldemort could just Imperius someone and that victim would become as powerful as him while they are being controlled.

- The Imperius Curse cannot be used to force a Secret Keeper to confess the secret. In other words, the Fidelius Charm overrules the Imperius Curse, just like how Veritaserum cannot be used to make a Secret Keeper confess their secret.

- The Imperius Curse cannot be used to gain knowledge that the victim doesn't actually know. Meaning if Voldemort wanted to force someone to tell him where the Elder Wand was, he would have to find someone who actually knew where the Elder Wand was and use the Imperius Curse on THAT person. However if the victim doesn't know where the Elder Wand is, then they couldn't give Voldemort the answer even if they were under the Imperius Curse. They would just tell him they don't know where it is, then get killed for being useless.

That's it. Those three limits only exist because without those three specific limits, it would open up dozens and dozens of plothole in the actual HP canon. I think putting illogical limits on the duration and effect of the Imperius Curse is just bad writing and comes off as really annoying since its this attempt to dumb down/rationalize magic.

*Its almost as if people who put unreasonable limits on the Imperius Curse forgot that its one of the three Unforgivable Curses for a reason.* Its an Unforgivable Curse BECAUSE its so overpowered. If the Imperius Curse was nerfed or limited too much then it wouldn't be unforgivable. Hence the reason why the only real limitation needed is that a witch or wizard should be able to resist the Imperius Curse if they strong enough and/or if the caster is weak enough. Those other three limitations I put in my bullet points only exist because without them, it would have many plotholes in canon.

The entire nature of the Unforgivables is how absurdly powerful they are. The Killing Curse cannot be blocked by any spell (e.g. Protego, etc), the Cruciatus Curse can inflict permanent mental damage, and the Imperius Curse grants absolute control over its victim. However the Killing Curse can be blocked by conjuring physical objects big enough to take the hit (which would beyond the average wiazrd), the Cruciatus Curse seemingly cannot kill anyone (but death isn't the worst experience compared to the Cruciatus or a Dementor), the Imperius Curse can be resisted by a witch or wizard with a strong enough willpower (something that is very rare), and none of the Unforgivables are too fast to be dodged.

There is no limits on how many people can be controlled at one time. There is no limits on how long you can control people if they are incapable of resisting it. There is no distance limitation to maintain it (e.g. you can use Imperio on someone in the UK, travel to America, and you'd still be able to control them). Having items to make them immune to Imperio is literally the dumbest limit I have heard of since if such a limitation existed then Imperio wouldn't be Unforgivable. Magical items that make people immune to the Imperius would make Imperio a worthless spell.

Most importantly, there is no continued concentration needed at all. The Imperius Curse doesn't need to be continuously maintained to remain active. Its almost like a sleeper agent thing where you can use it once, and then you can just let the victim carry on with their regular life and then just take control whenever you want. Draco pretty much does this with Rosmerta in HBP since he obviously isn't controlling every single second of her actions, he just controls her when he needs to. If it needed continuous control then it would be too easy to tell if someone was under the Imperius Curse, which defeats the entire point of it.

I agree with this completely, and I like the idea of a curse this powerful. However, I also believe that unless limits are put on the Imperius curse, you just end up with bad story telling.

If it's not particularly hard to cast, can be chained, and is pretty much limitless control. And (even worse), the incantation and wand movement are common knowledge, meaning that any competent wizard can cast it.

Imagine a world where anyone can basically mind control anybody at will. It would be a total shitshow. "Nice car you got there." Whoops, now it's mine. "I don't agree with the law you suggested." Boom, controversial legislation passed. "Sorry, you lack proper bank identification." Lol nope.

They touch on this when Harry visits Gringotts, and the scene has always bothered me for that reason. The (second?) most secure place in all of Britain is broken into because of the Imperius curse. The tellers know that there will be a robbery, the trio clearly lacks the proper form of ID, but it doesn't matter because Harry can just mind control 4 different people.

One of the most secure places in the entire series is broken into by 3 17 year olds because of the Imperius curse.

If everyone acted totally logically (which, to be fair, isn't true for the HP series; it's YA literature, and I don't think any fan would disagree with that) and the Imperius curse becomes a total nightmare without any restrictions on it.

** - Casting requires physical proximity, but distance doesn't reduce the effect
- Only one victim at a time, and it takes concentration -- it can't be "daisy chained"
- It can only control/cause the euphoric feeling if it's being actively held, the caster has to concentrate and keep their intent focused
- Strong-willed witches and wizards (and a small group of muggles--needs research) can throw it off, but only when it's being actively controlled -- if they don't experience the euphoric feeling but for a moment or two once or twice every few weeks, they might not ever realize they've been put under the curse
- A strong Occlumens can cast off the curse almost immediately
- It works like a suggestion, the caster doesn't actually "take over" the body of the other person. "Jump on the desk, Potter."

In that same vein, a caster can suggest, "Kill the muggle" or "torture the muggle," but it would be the one under the Imperius to decide how to do that. Most often, the controlled wouldn't be able to focus enough anger or hatred for the killing curse or the torture curse to be effect while also experiencing the euphoric feeling. Basically meaning:

- Those under the Imperius cannot cast Unforgivables

** I'm not going to get into restrictions until I get home, so I am going to address your restrictions.

Only one actively controlled at the same time is something I wouldn't do. I would think that you can cast it as many times as you want, but it costs an absurd amount of power, so realistically only a few people could be imperiused, and that is only with a powerful person like Voldemort.

I would disagree with distance reducing effects because of one reason- it's /magic/. It doesn't care about distance!

I would agree with passage of time, because as I believe it takes energy while the person is under the imperius. Eventually they one controlling them will run out of power.

A strong willed person throwing it off I agree with, because from what i've seen it implants the suggestion in your mind, not dissimilar to legimency. A strong willed person would be able to react to the suggestion and say /no/.

The existence of magical artifacts that can make you immune im iffy about. I mean sure, anything is possible right? But on the other hand, if something like that was possible why would people not buy those instead of learning Occulamency? But I digress, it is definitely possible.

I would agree with physical proximity, because I view spell similar to bullets- you fire them off, and they go towards you, but they can miss and will obviously not go on forever. So, going by my bullet logic they would also have a range.

On a side note, I think this is the longest thing i've ever written on here :P

** I explored what might happen if the canon Imperius curse [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11901553/1/Imperius][worked as advertised]]. In short, the entire magical world is controlled by a handful of dark lords using the Imperius on several others, each of those people using it on a few others, etc.

Your list of potential limitations is good. Others I would consider employing:

- You get direct physical control over the person, nothing more. It's a test of your acting skills and knowledge of the person to use the curse for mayhem.
- It takes concentration to control people. It would be highly unusual to be able to carry on a conversation in your own body and with an Imperius'd person at the same time.
- The curse lapses when the caster sleeps.
- Exposure breeds immunity. Not exactly the same as "time reduces the effect", which might only require you to recast the spell periodically.
- The curse operates on a magical level, so it can affect mages and squibs but not muggles. (In my fics, I commonly have it that souls are real and measurable but muggles don't have them.)
- Controlled people can't cast Unforgiveables.

If you stick with canon, the curse makes you euphoric. This suggests a weak test for it if you can gauge someone's emotions, though depending on the victim's acting abilities and the caster's orders, you might need rather more direct access than just looking at the person's face.

**** You seem to be missing the whole point about fanfiction -- that it doesn't need to stick to canon. I even had a paragraph that started with "If you stick with canon" and it's /after/ the muggles not having souls bit, so you might want to read more carefully in the future even if the contextual clue that we're in a /fanfiction/ subreddit and not [[/r/HarryPotter]] isn't sufficient.

Specific to this discussion, it's almost entirely about how the Imperius curse is too strong in canon and that fanfiction authors might come up with explicit limitations to explain why the entire world isn't controlled by it. So that should be a huge contextual hint that we're going to talk about deviations from canon.

Or possibly you misread my statement about souls as saying that that's what I think about canon? I'm rather certain that I specifically said "In my fics", which should have been enough of a clue, considering it's entirely explicit instead of a subtle suggestion.

Do you assume that I would keep everything the same as canon except for muggles not having souls? That would be terrible writing. In two fics I have that even mention this idea, none of them attempts to visit any of the stations of canon, and none features Dementors attacking muggles.

If I made it so that muggles don't have souls and still wanted to show muggles and Dementors in the same area, I would have to write that differently. I could say that Dementors' fear aura is psychophysiological instead of magical, for instance. I could have them attack with their limbs. Granted, I can't have them suck non-existent souls out of muggles, and perhaps the effect on squibs would be somewhat different. Or perhaps Dementors wouldn't even be able to interact with muggles. But I didn't write any of that into a fic, so you aren't complaining about anything I wrote -- or, as near as I can tell, anything in reality.

So I don't see where you have room to complain. I'm not specifying something is canon when it's inconsistent with canon, nor am I writing anything that is internally inconsistent relating to Dementors and soulless muggles.

Perhaps you just hate it when people deviate from canon?

****** As you say, it would be something that Death Eaters would use to justify mistreating muggles. It's not something I could use to justify it. I wrote in one of my stories:

#+begin_quote
  When she'd seen ghosts and talking portraits, she'd investigated, and it turned out Muggles could not become either. She'd come to the conclusion that this "soul" concept didn't apply to Muggles, but that didn't mean her parents were not people, or not worthy of moral consideration.
#+end_quote

To expand on that idea, there are several concepts at play. One is the thing that lets certain types of magic operate on you -- horcruxes, Legilimency, memory charms, ghostification, animated portrait magic, maybe the Killing Curse. (If I were investigating a real phenomenon, I'd start out by grouping them together, and later I would investigate whether they're really in the same category.) Another is whatever makes you capable of thought, the thing that gives you a will. That's what gives you moral responsibility. Muggles obviously have wills and are capable of thought. A related concept is whether something is capable of suffering, which is one reason that you must give a thing some level of moral regard, and muggles can suffer. You can also talk about a seat of emotions, which will probably go along with your capacity for thought. (Again, subject to investigation.) And if you're religious, your religion may or may not include the concept of souls, which might do something else entirely.

In canon, we don't know about animated portraits or ghosts of muggles. We know there are memory charms that work on them, and we know the Killing Curse works on them. If muggles don't have souls, then you might need to use a different type of memory charm on them. Maybe Legilimency doesn't work on them. But this is an entirely separate consideration from whether they can think and feel and make decisions. It's at least potentially separate from whether muggles or mages are subject to reincarnation, or whether they have an afterlife.

These are all at least sometimes called "souls", but that's a quirk of language rather than an indelible union of concepts in reality.

** I've always thought that the curse had no limits, other than the stigma of being an Unforgivable, and its difficulty to effectively cast. I also think that somebody very powerful like Voldemort, Dumbledore, Grindelwald, and even people like Harry, Lucius Malfoy, Bellatrix Lestrange, and Amelia Bones, could resist the curse effortlessly, and cast it properly as well. But less skilled and strong wizards, or somebody without experience casting it, while still being able to cast the curse, they would have the issue of its effectiveness waning over time.

I do think it has flaws though. It is stated in canon that the Secret held by a Secret Keeper is in one's /soul/, which I think means that trying to get the secret out with the Imperius and Veritaserum would be totally ineffective. And I also think items that allow resisting to the Imperius completely defeats the purpose of creating and/or using it, depending on when said item the author puts in was invented.
