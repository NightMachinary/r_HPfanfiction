So, I'm just having a bit of milk and cookies as I'm not tired and it's currently 2:35 am. Then I just have this sudden thought. Why is Voldemort called the worst dark lord in recent history? I feel like Grindelwald was truly worse, as he lead an actual war spanning the globe, compared to what I feel like is a civil war from Voldemort. Also, there have to be darker wizards and witches in other countries that could perhaps rival or beat Voldemort, in that regard. So I guess what I'm saying is, is Voldemort truly the worst, and everything else is relatively peaceful, or is Great Britian so isolated that other dark rulers aren't really known to them.


** I think it's sort of in the same regard that Hitler is considered by many to be the greatest monster of history. He's just one of the most recent horror shows.

**** Probably not, given that he failed and his regime was a fucking joke.

** Maybe, Grindelwald while horrible was not as brutal as voldemort and more restrained.

I always saw grindelwald puting on the ruse of being the leader of a legitimate political movement, which restrained him somewhat in his actions

while voldemort had no such cares, you publically talk against voldemort and your entire family might end up dead

Grindalwald however built a prison to put his enemies in. I feel grindalwald was convinced he was doing the right thing and as such was more willing to hold back from killing his fellow wizards in hopes he could convince them to his side

** Voldemort broke into a house to murder a baby in his crib. He was Evil with a capital E. Grindelwald must have never personally gone out of his way to commit infanticide.

** I think some of it had to do with the horror of the situation. During the blood war, no one knew who to trust, people would simply disappear with no warning. It created an atmosphere of intense fear across the entire country. Now granted, I do think that Grindelwald at least had a worse international reputation, since Voldemort was at least limited to the British Isles during his reign, while Grindelwald affected most of the continent, but I can see why a dark lord who makes it impossible to know who to trust would strike greater fear into the hearts of the populace

*** We also really only hear about Voldemort from British wizards/witches (do Fleur or Krum ever really talk about him in canon?). If you or someone you know was personally affected by the Blood War, it's going to stick out way more in your mind than a war on the continent that you only heard about in the news.

** A large part of it is that Grindelwald was prejudiced against Muggles, not Muggleborns. Thus, the magical community might hate and fear him... but not as much as Voldemort, who slaughtered entire portions of the magical community because of their birth status or the fact that they didn't agree with his views.

Even then, Grindelwald wanted to rule over Muggles for their own good, while Voldemort just wanted to murder and torture everyone who didn't meet his standards.

*** In truth, I don't believe Voldie is truly prejudiced against muggleborns, but muggles all around. I think he couldn't give a dang as long as you were useful. Muggleborns are a scapegoat for him to use to gain followers, similar to Hitler and Jews.

**** In Chamber of Secrets, he affirms that he thinks Muggleborns are inferior, just like Salazar Slytherin.

****** He doesn't mind Half-Bloods, obviously, considering he himself is one. Dumbledore notes that he chose Harry, a Half-Blood like Riddle, instead of Neville, the Pureblood, to 'mark as his equal.'
