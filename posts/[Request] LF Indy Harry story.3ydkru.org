It was a story written a while back where Harry is adopted by this pureblooded woman in his 5th year (I think) and makes friends from another wizarding school in england. It explores dark magic and song magic iirc with harry's grandmother having died under suspicious circumstances. It also has harry remembering the lives of a pureblood family's heir (the one he was adopted into).

I'd really appreciate it if anyone remembers which fic this is. Thanks!
