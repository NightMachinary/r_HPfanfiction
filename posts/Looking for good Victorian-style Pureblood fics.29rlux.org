The frills, the obscene amounts of wealth, the intrigue, the bursting corsets, marriage laws and betrothals and all that sort of stuff. Whether it's reasonable or whether it's a total anachronistic slugfest, I find that I like Ancient and Noble Family stories a lot.


** I don't think I've read any that had bursting corsets, but this seems like what you're looking for:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7694530/1/Midnight-Gold-The-Rise-Of-The-Forgotten-Lord]]

The chronicles of the rise of Lord Harry James Potter and his battle to rebuild the Potter family to its former glory, while working to prove himself worthy of the Potter name and its ancient legacy. Neville is true B-W-L, Rated M for mature themes, No slash.

** im never any help for these things but I can think of one vaguely connected - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8615605/76/The-Never-ending-Road]] Author mentioned a time or two her inspiration for the Greengrasses were jane austen type novels. Its a very minor part of the story but you know impoverished family trying to marry up into wealth.

If vaguely connected is enough for you I can say I liked it because of Harriette. Never thought in a million years I would like a Snape/Harry fic but as a girl she really is actually different and the author actually is taking things slow and believable so no underage sexy times.

*** How have I never stumbled upon this? It's basically everything I've been looking for lately. fem!Harry, Snape, rescue from the Dursleys... and Snarry in the future, to boot. I am in heaven.

*** I just finished [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8311387/1/Roundabout-Destiny]] so I'm actually finding myself very open to remade characters. This looks good.

** This doesn't take place literally in the Victorian era but I thought [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8121773/1/Of-Power-and-Prestige][Of Power and Prestige]] by Ell Roche and ExcentrykeMuse was well written and very interesting, not to mention a good story. It's got a whole courtship ritual thing going on, and a conservative/old-fashioned social milieu, plus intrigue and pretty robes. It's also a female Harry story, and Haesel is paired with Tom Riddle. It's so, so AU though and Riddle never became Voldemort, and he also doesn't look old, so it's not creepy. At least not very creepy. "Nothing could tempt Marvolo, Lord Slytherin, to leave the Lone Islands---except, perhaps, for Lady Haesel Potter, the most powerful witch of her generation. TMR/Fem!Harry."

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6687799/1/The-Tale-of-Sir-Cadogan][The Tale of Sir Cadogan]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8596476/1/Starnlicht][Starnlicht]] are both stories set in the Wizarding World past. Not exactly bursting corsets, but intrigue. Certainly good, unique stories.

** I don't know if it's exactly what you're looking for, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5891179/1/La_Cerise_The_Sweetest_Cherry]] has a summary saying "regency-era AU" - I remember it as being something like what you mentioned - warning, though, it is maybe a teensy bit smut heavy.

**** Regency is actually around the Napoleonic Wars, the eighteen-teens and eighteen-twenties. Downtown Abbey is about a hundred years later.
