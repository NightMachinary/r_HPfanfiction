** There's a quote from Doctor Who, in the 10th doctor series, where he's fighting Davros and he says "The man who abhors violence, never carrying a gun. But this is the truth, Doctor. You take ordinary people and you fashion them into weapons."\\
I want a story about that. Harry loving his friends and found family, and they in turn become his weapons with the hope he inspires. And Harry is horrified at what they're willing to sacrifice for him. I think his fight with Voldemort would have more meaning then, because it's not just about survival anymore, it's about stopping those he cares about dying for him.

*** So... canon basically, right? That's my biggest problem with most HP fanfic tbh. They leave out canon elements that don't really matter, while ignoring one of the most emotional aspects of the story. How people around Harry sacrificed so much, not just to end Voldemort, but for him as well. Making Harry an asshole without any friends, or bashing any of the characters does nothing but take away one of the core elements of the story imo.

** OP, are you me? Lol. I get the urge to make Harry super powerful, but as an adult you realize that being kind is more important than being smart, and it's nice to read stories about that. Following this thread

**** Oh, absolutely. Tricky/smart/powerful protagonists are interesting to read and easy to root for. That's why Homer's Odyssey is one of the greatest stories of all time. But when I read Harry Potter, I like reading about themes to do with love, kindness, and human relationships.

#+begin_quote
  This is the story of how Voldemort and the tools he created to defy death were destroyed by Harry Potter and me while sitting in an empty Hogwarts classroom using Harry's idea, my design, and most importantly, our intent. Set during 6th Year.

*** As the author of this story I can confirm that one of my main motivations for writing it was exactly what you are asking for in a story. It is shocking to me how few stories have tried this approach.

Appreciate the recommendation!

** Believe it or not, /HPMoR/ flip-flops on the matter for a while but ends on the suggestion that it is indeed Harry's capacity for love/empathy which Voldemort lacked.

*** And IIRC Harry thought it was a reasonable possibility the first time he heard it. The reasoning was something like if happiness is the weapon against dementors, why not love for an undying dark wizard.

**** Be aware that the first 20% or so of HP:MOR is awful. Aggressively, unremittingly awful. More or less everything from the start of the story, through the Diagon Alley trip, up to Harry's first potions class and its aftermath is so overwhelmingly smug and creepy and [[/r/iamverysmart]] that I started and gave up on this fic something like a half-dozen times.

It gets slightly better, and when the thinly-veiled SI finally gets over himself and starts actually telling a real story, it gets quite good. There's a great story arc involving an Azkaban break-in, and something about mock battles for DADA, and other interesting ideas. Near the end, it gets pretty gripping and although I found the ending cheap and unsatisfying, as fanfic goes it's easily a far cut above average.

If you find yourself reading the Diagon Alley shopping trip and rolling your eyes so hard they fall out, it may not be worth pushing through the rest of the story. But if you don't mind the smug condescension that Harry has during the shopping trip, then you'll likely enjoy the rest of it.

I've done no small amount of tooling around with a heavy re-write of HP:MOR to make Harry less of an impossible prick since so much of the story is so good, and it's a shame that the beginning is so stomach-churning.

**** HPMOR is just a story. Sure it was one of the first I read and sure I enjoyed it but even still I understood it was just someone's interpretation of the world. It doesn't really deserve to be lauded as a work of literary genius /or/ as a someone's +left over ramen+ /cough/ trash. I would recommend reading it because it is grammatically more developed than 90% of other FanFictions, because it has spawned FF of itself if you actually enjoy it, and because, most importantly of all, it is complete and /tries/ to deal with some concepts you might not have seen elsewhere - regardless of how well it actually manages them.
