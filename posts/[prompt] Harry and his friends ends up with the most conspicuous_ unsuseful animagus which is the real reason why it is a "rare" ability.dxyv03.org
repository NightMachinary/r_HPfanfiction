So im thinking about having the most conspicuous or unuseful animagus form. Which is the reason why most people really dont become one or atleast tell they arent one. Imagine that Harry assumes he'll be an awesome bird of prey only to end up the most fitting bird for a Potter, a Goose or evn a cockroach(but that useful and not conspicuous) . Or something like being a giraff or zebra. Perhaps a clam or narwal only for people to freak out because they need water but aren't sure if it's fresh water or salt water . I imagine that Voldemort will be a jellyfish since technically their immortal. It all ended up that Harry and his friends agreed that none of them ever mentions being an animagus and istead tell thats its really hard that they cant do it.


** Theres this one story he does turn into a cockroach but performs a ritual to sacrifice his animagus form and has dimensional pocket but I forget the story, perhaps tou could look into that?

  Harry grows up watching anime and fantasizing about having superpowers. When his Hogwarts letter arrives, he jumps at the chance to live the life of a harem protagonist. Not a harem fic. Timeline moved forward to modern day.

** I think any extremophile animagus would be the most useless. They might survive in extreme conditions but they still die in normal ones and it makes the entire thing useless. For example a fish that lives near a hit water vent and feeds of chemicals in the water is only useful in that specific condition. I think you could make Ron's reaction pretty good too. Poor kid would get so excited because can your animagus sit four thousand metres beneath the surface and eat sulfur, No, and then he realises he first needs to get there to be used and his big bragging speech failed dramatically.

** [[http://www.rhjunior.com/eng/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/voldemort.png][This cartoon]] shows Harry with a very, very conspicuous Animagi form and the results thereof.

The usefulness of it is somewhat debatable...
