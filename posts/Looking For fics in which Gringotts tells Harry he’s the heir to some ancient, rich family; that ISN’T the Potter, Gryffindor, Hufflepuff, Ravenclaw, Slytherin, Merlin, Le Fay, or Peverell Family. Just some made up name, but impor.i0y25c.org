***** The name Count Drakul comes up in Harry Potter as the father of vlad and the vampire behind the muggle dracula myth. This happens in the video game though so take it into your own headcannon as you will.

Count Drakul also comes up in the dresdon files but given the lack of context in the original post i don't think that's the reference.

****** Right. Of the ones I can remember details of, one was explicitly a Castlevania crossover, and the other it was just one of a big list of marriage contracts he got. Although it was outright questioned how he wound up inheriting it from a family that had all turned into vampires. I think they were going to go Castlevania, but they dropped it.
