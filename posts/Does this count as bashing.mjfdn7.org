So when I typically write Percy fics, I write him as a single dad and all. And I wanted to write a fic where Audrey abruptly comes back and wants to see their girls, but their girls dont want to see her and she gets angry and they have a big fight. She's supposed to be feeling entitled to see them despite not being in their lives for 13 ish years (if that makes sense).

I'm just not not sure if that would count as bashing or not. I dont mind if it is, I just wanted to know so I can tag appropriately for it or not

Thanks in advance!


** That doesn't strike me as bashing because we never meet Audrey in the books, so it's just how you're developing her personality with no prior information other than her marriage to Percy. Bashing, to me, is when you manipulate, fabricate, or selectively focus on negative traits of a character to make them look bad.

Unless you're asking if this is bashing Percy? In which case, also no. I think it's very reasonable to want to protect his kids from a mom that walked out on them. You don't need to make your characters selfless saints to avoid bashing; it just has to be a well-rounded and fair portrayal.

*** No, I meant Audrey (sorry if that wasn't clear). But thank you!

**** That's what I thought. So yeah, I think that's totally fair, and I also don't really think anyone would consider any Audrey portrayal to be bashing because we have no idea who she is.

But even if it were with someone we know well like if Ginny left Harry with the kids, it's still not bashing if Ginny is well-rounded and portrayed sympathetically even if she's made a selfish decision that she's unlikely to have ever made in canon. I think if you respect the characters enough to worry about bashing them, you likely are not bashing them.

** I don't think that's bashing because that certainly happens in real life

**** Ron does have some jealousy problems, so it isn't bashing to make him abandon Harry after he becomes a champion or something similar. It is bashing to make him jealous enough to join the Death Eaters or do something similar to that.

***** I haven't read that many where he does join the death eaters but I see your point.

I take bashing as intentionally twisting a character in order to have them suit a completely different role in your story. Ie push someone in one direction.

***** Yeah,but thats the point its bashing. Which is taking someone's bad aspects and amplifying it a lot. I mean sure Ron might get jealous but what he's just a human teenager,and neither of those 2 are perfect. We are humans were naturally jealous at things we dont have because there certainly is no perfect human let alone a teenager.
