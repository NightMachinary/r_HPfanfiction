I have one scene in my head that's demanding to be written and I really think I can turn it into a little novella or something. Set in the 70s when James and Sirius were still in school.

I like all my fics to be canon compliant with a bit of a twist. So I have this idea of James and Sirius being in love, around 5th year not just hot for each other and fucking in classrooms, etc. And somehow James has to end up with Lily and Sirius still as his best friend. Nowhere in the novels did it say they DIDN'T have a secret love affair/relationship.

I couldn't seem to find many GOOD, well-written /stories/ (not just one-shots) that aren't just pure lust. Can anyone recommend any? or do you have suggestions for elements that you'd love to see in a story like this?

I'm just collecting ideas and plotting at this point - so this is me hurling my tiny fragile idea into the internet hoping it'll grow. I'm sure there's a rule against asking others to write your fic for you, but that's 100% NOT what I'm doing...

/James/Sirius Romance fanfics: discuss!!!/

Thanks!


** Firstly: a reason for Lily to hook up with James (reason to dump Snape, she had, but that alone does not push her into the arms of an 'insufferable toerag').

Secondly: Pranks that are actually pranks and not just them bullying Slytherins.

Thirdly: Wormtail as a full-fledged member of the group, a lookout maybe, to go with his reputation as a tagalong, but he learned to be an animagus with them, they trusted him, he was their friend.

Lastly: James, Sirius, and James' parents dealing with the abuse Sirius' family put him through. He ran away at sixteen and moved in with James, that should feature in any long/longish story focusing on their love/friendship.

*** Excellent points! It always kind of bugged me that Peter was always semi-bullied in all the Maurader fics I read. he stayed with them for seven years. The Potters AND Sirius trusted them to be Secret Keeper - He obviously has some worth.

And yes!!! We never get an explanation for Lily finally getting with James other than he straightened out and Snape got too into the Dark arts.

I'm totally plotting a big prank in my head right now - should be a challenge to write, I suck at them lol

** I wouldn't mind seeing a few short fics about how the two prank the fuck out of everyone in school.

But beside that, I don't see much potential.

*** haha thanks! I think it helps with my creativity - sometimes my mind spirals into impossible weird plots that make zero sense. It helps keep my stories more plausible, which I think makes it more fun to read.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3139906/1/XX-Not-a-Love-Story]] I would recommend Not a Love Story by guns and butter. It's heavy in angst but it's difficult to find good James/Sirius fanfics because there are so few, which is a shame. It's a one shot, sorry
