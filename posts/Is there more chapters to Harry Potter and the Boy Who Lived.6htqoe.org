***** There is a complete (as in all the material Santi has written) version on DLP and there's a goddamn reason Santi hasn't posted it for public viewing. If he wanted people to be able to read it, he would post it. He didn't. Stealing it from WBA on DLP is an asshole move. Linking to it is an asshole move.

******* I think the point he was trying to make was that you shouldn't link a plagiarized fic whether you know of a legitimate way to get the other chapters or not. You should be reporting plagiarized fics as soon as you see them, not giving other people links to them and helping the plagiarist. By doing so you're implicitly supporting the plagiarist instead of the original author, and there's really no defense for that.

********* Why do you feel to attack the other person on a personal level? That's pretty shitty, man.

Also, "white-knighting" is such an awful insult. Is helping others suddenly bad? Is it frowned upon?

Generally I understand it as insult if the defended person would be able to defend itself, but here they might no know about this thread, and Scott raises a valid point.

And no, I'm not white-knighting. I'm just baffled by your behaviour.

********** Scott was irrationally attempting to lambaste someone for linking extra chapters to a story. He himself expressed displeasure at the idea of there being more people on DLP to shitpost in order to get into the Work By Author section. And when someone gave the dude a compromise, Scott flipped out at him. Scott is an indecisive person who doesn't know what he wants. This is made clear in almost all of his half-assed projects.

*********** What was irrational about my lambasting? DLP has a certain culture. Part of it is we don't like seeing material from WBA stolen and posted without the author's permission. The moment The Santi says he's fine with it, I'll walk back all my whiteknighting indecisive comments on this issue.

So you take it out on the messenger like every adult does? Grow up.

It's fanfiction. The author already doesn't have any claim towards his work due to it being an adaptation of another copyrighted story.

#+end_quote

Which he can't because he no longer writes, nor is active on any of his forums. It's like telling someone who wanted to continue forging the sword that they can't and should ask Myst Shadow for permission. Myst can't give anyone permission because he likely hasn't logged in for years.

So what? The Santi has a bigger claim to it than anyone else because he wrote it. If he has zero, then you have less than zero.

*********** He wasn't trying to irrationally lambaste someone. He should have been nicer about it, to be fair, but there is no universe in which he is wrong and ProtoZel is right. He did not link extra chapters to a story, he linked a plagiarized version of the story, which is shitty to the extreme. Supporting plagiarism is never a good thing, and attacking plagiarists and those who support them is not irrational.

Except when the dudes preface with a note saying that it isn't their work and they're trying to make it easier for those that don't want to go to the cancer known as DLP for a story.

************* Except when that doesn't matter. You don't get to plagiarize a story and say its fine because you made a note in the beginning. It's not right unless Santi gives his express permission for this, which he didn't. If Santi wanted to upload the chapters, he would. He's not dead, he's still active online. You are clearly advocating against the author's wishes and seem to think you have the moral high ground. What's more cancer, DLP, or a place which encourages plagiarism and therefore discourages people to actually put their creative work online, lest it be stolen by people like you?

Once again, it's not plagiarism under any context due to him stating that it isn't his story and he doesn't own it.
