Basilisk-born counts,

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11244373][Sine Qua Non]] counts,

an uncontinued fic which I read a long time ago and it had just 2 chapters where Harry jumps into the Arc in 1996 and then later Charlie brings his best friend from his school years (time-travelled Harry, obviously) to the Order - counts

do you understand what I'm looking for?

  Harry was massively disappointed in how things were going after the final battle. Nothing had changed, it only looked like it on the outside. So he decides to change the past to prevent certain things from happening. Being the Master of Death has its perks. Time-travel, Harry / OC

  Rita spouting lies, branded as a Dark wizard and goblins in a rage; Harry's had enough. So, he seeks to jump back in time to save himself from a life of misery and fickle loyalty, maybe a little revenge and mysteries along the way.Time Travel! A Harry raises himself fic.
