iirc it was Hermione, Ginny, Luna, and (Probably?) Lavender. They show up in some kind of special part of Potter manor. James' parents are alive, and they help the women plan. It's possible Regulus made an appearance later in the fic.

Thanks for the help.

  When Luna is approached by ancient magicks for help with a particularly pesky problem, she sets in motion a prophecy involving a Werewolf, an irate Goddess and four marauders that will turn the Wizarding World on its head. Otherwise known as: How Luna tore apart the fabric of reality so that her friends could get decently laid, and accidentally saved the world in the process."Time Travel. Could there have been anything worse? After the past thirty years of war? It was finally over, but no. Not for Hermione Granger! Hermione Granger has to deal with space-time anomalies and causal loop theory and the consequences of others' actions."Time-Turner, EWE/AU, Wolf!Mate fic with all that follows in its wake. Previously named The Prophecy That Should Have Been.
