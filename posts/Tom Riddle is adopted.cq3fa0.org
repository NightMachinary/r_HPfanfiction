I often read fics in which Harry is adopted from the Dursleys by a loving family. Does anyone know of any fics in which Tom Riddle experiences the same stroke of fortune?


** There are many fics in which Harry or Hermione go back in time to adopt/raise Tom. Here are a few that I have enjoyed:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/284278][If Them's the Rules]] - Harry adopts Tom.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15430560][In The Bleak Midwinter]] - Hermione gets the Riddle family to care for Tom.

*** Agreed. As far as I've seen, these are the best written Tom-gets-adopted stories in the fandom. That haven't been abandoned, at least.

**** Sadly, there are some great abandoned adoption fics. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2856616/1/Tom-Marvolo-Riddle-Potter][Tom Marvolo Riddle Potter]] is one of my favorites, but it's long dead.

*** Awesome, thank you! I mentioned this in another comment, but I can never get the AO3 app to work properly for me... Am I doing something wrong, or does the app just stink?

*Summary:* Harry is the girl who wanders in and out of time. Tom knows nothing about her, and despite the fact she has whisked him away from the orphanage to live with her, he's starting to think he never really will either. Regardless, he is determined to never let her go, not even in the face of time, space, or dark lords. timetravel

*** Ooh, this is good so far! It warms the heart to read about little Tomikins eating ice cream.

*** Awesome, I'll check it out! This is really silly, but I tend not to read AO3 fics because the app is crappy and always crashes on me. :/ I know I'm missing out on a whole world of awesome fics.

**** I don't think AO3 has an official app, some third party just made an app that sort of works with the website. I just view the website straight on my phone. It works great in Safari.

  History would be different if Tom Riddle had been adopted by a loving parent. Right?JK Rowling owns these characters, even the time travelers in my alternate universe.
