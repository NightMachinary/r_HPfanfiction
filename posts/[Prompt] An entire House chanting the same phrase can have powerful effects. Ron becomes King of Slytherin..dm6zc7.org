As an optional part of the prompt, he becomes King of both Slytherin and Gryffindor, and the two houses are united, willingly or not.


** Oh my god, this would make so much sense, since rituals would include repeated chanting. Combine that with hundreds of people chanting while emotions are running wild, like those at a Quidditch Game? Could count as a ritual

** I think I read a fic similar to this.

But it was "weasley is our king" and Arthur became king since he's the head of house. He pretty much did great and kinda reminded Ron that just cause he's prince now that he needs to be more of a model person and not be a prat.

**** True. It became a mess with a number of tropes throw in but I cant say I didn't like the monty python and GOT reference. The fic definitely doesnt take itself seriously.

** No, let him become a Wizengamot lord of Slytherin and Gryffindor. Could be pretty funny, especially if the houses were as stupid as they are in OP Harry fics.
