** A Long Journey Home fits the requirements.

linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home]])

It's incomplete and likely abandoned (last updated March 2027) but still worth a read if you've never read it before.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

** Nightmares of Futures Past is well written, I love how it develops Ginny as a major character and helps others to reach more of their potential, but it's incomplete (technically not abandoned, but only updates once every few years). And FFN deleted it, so your best shot is the community-maintained ebook/PDF on GitHub ([[https://github.com/IntermittentlyRupert/hpnofp-ebook/releases/latest]]).
