On his deathbed, Harry blesses his family to have long lives, and for their bloodline to last into eternity. His wife (whoever that is in your story) gives the family the same blessing. Through the course of their lives, Harry's three children find the three Hallows through various means- for, just like death, they can be delayed, but not stopped- and, on their deathbeds, give the same blessing their mother and father gave. Harry and his wife are promptly revived, their bodies as they were at their peak. Their minds hold all their memories up to their death, but are otherwise as healthy as their peak as well. Shenanigans probably ensue, possibly plot. Most likely both.
