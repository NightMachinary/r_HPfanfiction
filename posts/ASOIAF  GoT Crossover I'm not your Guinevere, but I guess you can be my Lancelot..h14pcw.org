*Please Note: This isn't supposed to be a romance. The title is a play on the fact Ginevra (Ginny's name) and Lancel are variants of Guinevere and Lancelot. Both characters have names based on figures from Arthurian legend.*

I don't know why, but I guess I'm brimming with ideas this week. This was on my mind yesterday while pondering over [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12646365/1/Dragonkin-Abroad][/Dragonkin Abroad/]] and its sequel of sorts (or is it AU?), [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12784378/1/Owlsrest][/Owlsrest/]].

This prompt spawned as an AU idea off of [[https://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/the-trees-of-arcane-hp-got-xover-wip.471943/][/Trees of Arcane/]], which I'm still working on. I guess I wanna test drive the world building before I dive into some serious stuff with /Trees of Arcane/ . I've already tried the pantser or discovery writing method and failed extraordinarily, so I figured I should do this before moving on back to /Trees of Arcane/ .

I'm aware balancing issues often keep people from writing this sort of crossover, and I even had a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/gtjj3q/in_prisoner_of_azkaban_time_turner_brokes_and/fscz8py?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share][back and forth]] with someone over it. Even before that, I've shared other [[https://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/miscellaneous-asoiaf-thread-x.487629/post-20507355][/musings/]] about it:

/The world mechanics on the wizarding side of magic were left vague in the outline, but it boils down to Planetos having an effect on how Wizadry works. It requires a lot of high concentration and patients, and spells can fade over time. In HP it's canon for conjurations to cease to exist after a witch or wizard dies, and spells can also backfire when not cast right. I've kept that, but I've taken some inspiration from the Nasuverse and added that the World tries to right anything that breaks the rules of nature when no price is paid, so you might see Full Metal Alchemist's Law of Equivalent Exchange be mentioned in relation to the state of Wizadry and why there's no longer any permanency and what's required to make things permanent; though, I suspect there might not be any permanency in the Potterverse either as hinted by Lily's protections fading and her goldfish vanishing when she died. There's also a reason this story is called Trees of Arcane. Different magics also seem to exist in ASOIAF, so wizards and witches won't be the only ones that can wield sorcery in this story. To make it easier to distinguish in story, Wizardkind(that's what I have Wizards and Witches refer to themselves when talking about their collective) calls their brand of magic Wizardry./

So uh, yeah, there's that. So now, onto the prompt!

In my world building for /Trees of Arcane/ each of the Kingdoms, even the Lands Beyond the Wall, with the exception of the Iron Islands, have Hidden Wizarding Enclaves. These enclaves run things on the magical side of things. So there's the Crownlander Enclave, the Riverlander Enclave, the Northern Enclave, the Reacher Enclave, the Dornish Enclave, the Vale Enclave, and the Westerlander Enclave. The Wizarding Enclave beyond the Wall is called the Enclave of the Far Northeast. Before the Doom and Aegon's Conquest, the Riverlander and Crownlander Enclaves were one. Over time, as Valyrian trade streamed through the east coast of Westoros, the unity of the Enclave of the Rivers and Hills began falling apart. Aegon's Conquest cemented the split between Hill and River wizards. The reason I mention this is, because these enclaves will play a role in /I'm not your Guinevere, but I guess you can be my Lancelot/ . So the story? Well...

Ginny Weasley wakes up to find herself on a botched ritual circle at High Heart. There are corpses everywhere, from the Ghost of High Heart herself to members of the extremist faction of the Green Men, the Watchers of Weir, also known as the Watchmen or Weirwatchers. She's horrified at the bloodbath that surrounds her and is utterly confused as to where she is, and then she begins asking when she is when she spots Acorn Hall in the distance. The only clue she has as to how she got there is the Resurrection Stone that was lying atop her chest when she woke up.

Ginny grows paranoid of staying at High Heart, because she feels as though: /The bleeding tree stumps are watching her with a thousand and one unseen eyes lying in wait. In wait of what? She didn't know, and she didn't want to stick around to find out/ . So she high tails it out of there after picking up the Ghost of High Heart's cane and jamming the Resurrection Stone on one of its gnarled ends. She snatched a dark green-- nearly black-- cloak off of one of the dead Green Men extremists as well. She also takes some pants and shoes to cover the bottom half of her nude form and picks up a sword and dagger from one of the other fallen combatants.

From there, her journey consists of trying to dodge any would be wizards investigating the incident at High Heart while also trying to figure out what the hell is going on.

A case of mistaken identity happens when she gets closer to Acorn Hall. Lady Ravella Smallwood thinks her to be the missing Sansa Stark, and in an effort to curry favor with the Lannisters, she welcomes Ginny to her home. She does that while calling on the Lord Lannister of Darry to come confirm if it's Sansa or not. A day or two after Lancel arrives Acorn Hall is attacked by the extremist faction of the Green Men and Ginny manages to flee on horseback with aid from Lancel like her namesake did.

So yeah, that's what I got so far.

Edit:

As for the magic situation, Planetos messes with Wizardry, and Ginny is newly resurrected. Those two conditions, along with her not having any knowledge of spells that were specifically tailored for usage on Planetos, forces her to rely on some of the natives for assistance. That native being Lancel in this case, at least until she recovers from her ordeal and gets ahold of some Planetosi wizarding spells.
