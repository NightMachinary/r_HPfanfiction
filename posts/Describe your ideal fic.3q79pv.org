Whether it's a link to a fic that already exists or a summary, describe the fic you've always wanted to read or write!


** A fic where the rest of the magical world is explored through a character driven and exciting story.

In it are:

- Mentions of magical places like Babylon, Atlantis and others
- A variety of magical creatures with their own cultures and ways of hiding from muggles
- Harry, Hermione and Ron as the original trio, or just Harry.
- New magics, deeper lore, a compelling history of magical beings on earth and mystical explanations for magic in general.

Not in it are:

- Horcruxes, Voldemort (had enough of him as the villain) and the usual suspects
- Blatant Mary-sueing of a region. May it be a wet Weeabo dream of Japan or the patriotic circlejerk of the US wizards.
- Super powerful Harry
- Lord Potter
- Awkward, written out sex scenes
- Harem
- The usual suspects (Mpreg and all that fuzz)
- Mothafuckin Magical Cores

What could be fun, but has potential to fail spectacular:

- Romance (maybe even with another magical race)
- Shamanism, Voodoo and other branches of magic. (The Wild Hunt in Central Europe would be a fun thing to explore)
- A variety of OC's

** My ideal story:

- Is Harry-centric, told from third person limited.

- Is set during Hogwarts years and tells a divergent storyline from canon (completely divergent, not a rehash with altered elements).

- Is a mixture of mystery, coming of age, and adventure, with some action, romance and politics.

- Tells a contained story each Hogwarts year which also contributes towards a developing 7 year arc.

- Characterises Harry as canon but emphasises his positive traits (determination, bravery, nerve, a cool head, strong willpower, great at making deductive leaps and solving puzzles).

- Has a clear character arc for each of Harry, Ron, and Hermione.

- No bashing of anyone. Canon characterisations all round, though it's okay to put slight twists on people (e.g. making Voldemort less crazy). Most importantly, that means no evil or incompetent Dumbledore. Also no inexplicably helpful uberGoblins.

- Puts Harry on a path towards having a level of magical skill roughly equivalent to his parents, but does so through playing to Harry's strengths of practical learning, making personal deductions about how things work on the basis of experience, intuition and practice. Harry does not turn into Hermione 2.0. He's already curious and enthusiastic about learning magic in canon, he just excels most in a practical environment (see Patronus Charm).

- Romance elements involve a succession of relatively non-serious relationships, not "Great Love". No OTPs that last the entire stretch of Hogwarts, no early marriages.

- Explores new locations within Hogwarts.

- Lots of material depicting Hogwarts as a magic school, not a warzone (i.e. coming of age elements). Lessons consist of more than a teacher giving a three minute speech, answering a few questions then sending kids to their next class. Lessons involve *[[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showpost.php?p=845116&postcount=145][activities]]*. Teenagers act like teenagers.

- Explores the history of magical Britain but through titbits not infodump.

- Develops a greater idea of the international wizarding world.

- Has a new DADA teacher each year who has some connection to larger events.

- Expands our knowledge of magic but doesn't provide any trite explanations such as "magic is X". Magic is explored primarily through magic in use rather than abstract discussions.

- The tone of the canon magical system is kept, including but not limited to: no magical exhaustion, no wish magic or shortcuts to power, no powerful wandless magic, no explanation of magic in physical/mathematical terms nor forcing magic to act analogously to physical forces (thermodynamics, I'm looking at you), understanding of magic playing a key role in its casting (either through understanding of theory or through intuitive understanding via experience).

- No sensible character at any point suggests that Muggle weapons could be used to overcome magical foes.

  A year after the war ends, Fate takes the opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why Fate thinks that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

** I also want to read a book where the prophesied one isn't the BWL, isn't the one 'marked as his equal'. Like Volde goes for Neville, Neville is the BWL. James and Lily are killed by death eaters, marauders die, or Sirius is in Azkaban, doesn't matter just that they don't take Harry.

So Harry is shipped off to the Dursley's, except without the threat of death eaters coming after them in retribution the Dursley's don't keep Harry they just dump him off at a church or something and he grows up similar to Tom Riddle. He'd be the one 'marked as his equal'. Still not sure what to do with the 'power he knows not' though. So he'd be more like a competing dark wizard than a hero.

** Okay, let's see. Good grammar is obligatory and not really even worth mentioning. Good writing clearly isn't obligatory for fanfiction, but the story would need that too.

I'd definitely want the ideal fic to be multi-pov. I don't think Harry alone provides a good enough slate to write the ideal fic, but you can't have a HP fic would Harry POV either. I think the characters I'd want to have a POV would be;

- Harry,

#+begin_quote
  for rather obvious reasons. Shows the story from a young perspective, and it's a POV inside Gryffindor (possibly other house. I think in /the/ ideal fic he'd be Slytherin).
#+end_quote

- Hermione,

#+begin_quote
  but only if Harry isn't actually in Gryffindor. Without Harry in Gryffindor I can see Hermione being alone and probably lonely too, which would make her a far more interesting character. She'd also be a good POV from Gryffindor if Harry wasn't there.
#+end_quote

- Draco,

#+begin_quote
  provides probably the most interesting Slytherin POV if Harry isn't sorted there. You could argue for a less important Slytherin POV, maybe Theodore or Daphne or whatever, but I think you could write the most interesting story with Draco. You don't really want to have too much POV from the top-players, but having someone that's closely connected to them would be interesting. I'm coming back to biased writing later, but for now I'll just mention that this would hinge on the author being capable to write a good Lucius. Someone in his position should be more Tywin Lannister and less Gilderoy Lockhart, as fanon likes to write Lucius.
#+end_quote

- Remus,

#+begin_quote
  if you want to write a good story, you can't just have POV from kids. Remus is probably the adult in the best position to write a POV from. Narcissa could work too, if you want an adult POV on Voldemort's side that isn't directly in the line of fire - I think Lucius would be too open. I likened his position to Tywin earlier, and you would notice if you've read ASoIaF that there are no Tywin POVs. You want the manipulative and powerful players to be outside the readers view - otherwise you'll miss a lot of possibilities for intrigue and plot threads.

  Back to Remus, he's not severely restricted in his movements like Sirius, he's directly affiliated with Dumbledore but not stuck at Hogwarts, and he's a part of an oppressed minority. He's also shown to be quite poor, while almost all other characters have at least a relatively comfortable amount of money, except the obvious token poor family, the Weasleys. After Yudkowsky I'm sort of sold on the idea that the wizarding world is already almost post-scarcity, but I digress.
#+end_quote

- Someone with Grindelwald,

#+begin_quote
  if you want to introduce Grindelwald as major player, you'll need a related POV character. You do not want to use Grindelwald himself as a POV character, because of reasons previously stated. You would probably have to find either a canon character to affiliate with him (a Voldemort related character fleeing to Grindelwald?) or introduce an OC.

  Personally, I'd love Harry to be affiliated with Grindelwald, but that's rather specific. Someone previously on this subreddit mentioned that maybe Grindelwald's ideology was in support of the muggleborns against pureblood elitism and muggles both, in which case you could have a muggleblood disillusioned with wizarding Britain leave and join his cause. A lonely intellectual Hermione could be very interesting, but I think she'd need some serious conditioning in order to join the wizarding nazis. She'd certainly fit in though.
#+end_quote

Next, I think the most key aspect of /the/ ideal fic would be a skilled and relatively unbiased author. I'm not sure I've read a fic that isn't either super-liberal "all-purebloods-are-idiots-and-inbred" to a degree that makes Rowling's canon morals seem tame, or "everything Voldemort said was correct and purebloods /are/ indeed the master race." These stories are usually slash too.

What I want is something written by someone that manages to stay unbiased and /doesn't/ push their real-life beliefs in the story. Firstly, because these are fictional characters, /not/ an extension of them, and secondly, because real life morals and ethics aren't 100% applicable in a fictional setting. Real life racism is one thing, where there's almost no differences in "races" and it's mostly a scapegoat for other ideologies, but in Harry Potter there's an obvious and incredibly fracturing difference in the races.

The ideal fic would definitely have to handle the muggle question. Characters like Dumbledore, Remus or Hermione would probably see the muggles as equals, in face of all logic, Voldemort and his supporters I think would see (note; this is a generalization. In the ideal story, I /expect/ every character to hold their own beliefs and morals. *NO* black and white.) the muggles as pests to be exterminated, and Grindelwald, I think, would want to rule them for the greater good.

The challenge comes in handling this appropriately. Modern western ideas tells us that Dumbledore is in the right here and that we must reach egalitarianism at all costs. And in an ideal real life situation, you are probably right. But in this setting? Hiroshima, Chernobyl, 1939, 1914, Holocaust, Industrialization, Colonization, Deforestation, Extinction, Dresden, Gulf of Mexico leaks, Fracking, Coral bleaching, Arctic melting, Desertification, Witch burnings, Crusades, Jihad, Inquisition - I could go on forever. There's one word that ties all of the above together: Muggles. Take that as you will.

Did I convince you above? Would you, as a muggleborn, become convinced by the argument above? I know I would. "/Everything on Earth would be better off without the muggles, except the muggles./"

To wrap up the ideal fic, I'd want satisfying endings, no deus ex machinaes or protagonist bias, well handled relationships, and realistic character growth and arcs.

For brownie points, have Grindelwald's end-game be a massive leyline ritual that restores Earth to it's ancient more magical state and obliterates all non-Magical "corruption." If you write the scene where New York falls apart and returns into an untouched swamp well, I may or may not love you forever.

I also probably forgot a lot of stuff but I'm tired and this is already long enough.

** My favorite fics are the ones where Voldemort is hiding in plain sight and immediately resorts to violence if something falls out of line.

Link to the first one: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8192853/18/Yes-I-am-Harry-s-Brother]]

- Voldemort's wraith cloud thing decides to pay a visit to Harry at Privet Drive to see what he's doing. He accidentally absorbs the horcrux in Harry's scar and gets a 6 year old body that looks related to Harry. He decides that the best course of action is to murder Dudley and Vernon, pretend to be Harry's illegitimate American brother and get adopted by Aunt Petunia so he can study whatever the power he knows not is.

Link to the second one: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9118123/1/To-Play-the-Devil]]

- Harry ended the war with an unbreakable vow with Voldemort that neither would directly or indirectly attack the other (or something like that) so both of them are immortal. 100 years later or so, Minister of Magic Draco Malfoy forces both of them to work together to investigate some disappearances in France. The ending of this one is really great.

** My ideal fic is one that actually uses and/or explores the more extreme, deeper, or just plain /older/ forms of magic. Legitimate white and black magic, necromancy, druidic magic, ritual magic, sympathetic magic like voodoo. The /primordial/ things. I remember in one fic I read, Harry was getting a tour of the Department of Mysteries, and the Unspeakable guiding him pointed to a scale model of the Earth and said "Don't touch that. The last time someone bumped it, Mt. Krakatoa erupted. We're still not sure if it was a coincidence."

What I'm actually attempting (slowly) to write is something that's been swimming around in my head for a while.

See, one thing that's been bugging me ever since I started reading fanfiction is that the number of actually /competent/ Harry Potters are few and far between. Mostly they try to stay true to canon, not that I'm saying they shouldn't, but canon Harry was angsty and lucky, nothing else. After five years of schooling, he barely knows as many spells. If he didn't have a brother wand, he'd be dead. If he weren't so damn attached to the disarming spell and disarmed Draco, he'd be dead. He /did/ walk to his damn death. If Voldemort weren't so attached to the Killing Curse, Harry would be dead.

It just gets ridiculous at times.

I don't want luck, I want to see a war torn /badass/. I want to see a fic where personal tragedy /forces/ him to make something more of himself.

To that end, what I'm writing about is 3 different Potters. Each get messed up in different ways. Each come out of it far greater than anyone could expect. And when their own stories end, they get pulled through a trans-dimension portal to fight in cannon Harry's stead, they /deal/ with it. Not everything goes right for them; a lot of things go wrong, in fact, because while they may be competent, they're fighting on the losing side. But I will most definitely enjoy having them bring the fight to the Death Eaters.

** I suppose I should start. My ideal fic is a mostly character-driven fic based on atmosphere and world building. Think Dark Souls, and that type of decadent, high fantasy atmosphere where you're roaming around a dead, dying world--that's the brand of atmosphere I like.

I've always wanted to write a story like this. As in, since maybe like two years ago. Still haven't got around to it because that shit is HARD. I have so many cool ideas for it too, I could have the first part of the story set in Atlantis, and that could be something like, I don't know, the final outpost of a now extinct civilization, and the characters would end up in a different world and try to find their way home and there would be ruins and castles and villages and temples and forests and, ugh! Nobody writes stuff like this! It's all romance and same old let's go to Hogwarts but a little bit differently this time.

That was a bit more of a ramble than I'd planned, but I think the point has been made.

***** I read the Hero trilogy probably five years ago so I don't remember too many details, but I remember the first book was great, the second one was okay but sometimes confusing, and the third one was fantastic.

I HEAVILY recommend checking out the authors real works, especialy the Reminiscent Exile series. The first book is short, but holy crap is the second one good

** Would love for longer fics with a proper femHarry/Voldemort or TMR (not the loveydovey Tom Riddle diary horcrux fics) where the femHarry is raised as a pureblood or is one. The best example of what I am thinking about is linkffn(Persephone Riddle). The torture which both Persephone and Voldemort get involved in where it describes them as "fallen angels" is one of the best scenes I have read.

Far and away the best fic series the HP fandom has ever produced. And it looks like it's heading towards femslash, which I also love.

I'd always wondered about this. Learning about the Taboo made sense of the fact that everyone flinched when his name was said, as saying his name basically called down death upon you. Anyone would flinch at that. Dumbledore was always encouraging people to say Voldemort's name, but in retrospect it was /very/ much unpolitic, even antagonistic, of him to do so, not even counting his other declarations of Voldemort's return. For an experienced statesman, this seems very strange. Frankly, I'm not sure Rowling even knew /how/ to make him politically savvy.

**** The Taboo would have made a great way to explain fear of Voldemort's name, but unfortunately it wasn't used in the first war. Probably because, as close as he got, Voldemort never successfully took control of the Ministry in the first war, and the Taboo is controlled by the Ministry.

linkffn(A Stranger in an Unholy Land) Explains this really well if you haven't read it. Basically Harry in this alternate dimension is a death eater, but a really ruthless and skilled one. People stop saying his name, they just call him /Him/ a lot. I think its Dumbledore who says 'Its a small step from /him/ to you-know-who.

Basically overall I don't think it was a magical taboo thing like in DH, I think the wizarding world and just a superstitious lot. The taboo wouldn't have worked the first time when a lot of people said his name, and he wasn't in control of the ministry anyway.

**** I'm not exactly interested in what made people afraid of uttering Voldemort's name, but generally, what made them so afraid of him. I want to see what horrendous atrocities he committed in order to be so reviled. How exactly the average wizard reacted to him. How he really displayed his prodigious power? because just Imperioing and Crucioing people isn't that special. What he was like before he "showed his true face" (as Sirius says)... and for that matter, when and why did his face began looking like a snake's. (I know that Horcruxes are involved, but suspect there is more to it, because Dumbledore told us he "underwent so many dangerous, magical transformations" and that's before all the Horcruxes come to light.)

Rowling informed us that Voldemort's rise was truly horrible, that he traveled the world and acquired powers and "consorted with the very worst of our kind" (/who were they?/), that he pushed the limits of magic further than anyone before him (I don't think that he's just talking about making a Horcrux x 7 here). But she never really shown us examples of all this, only threw us some token chewed bones.
