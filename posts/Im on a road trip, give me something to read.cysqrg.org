** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief)

Heist story. Hermione wants revenge on Malfoy by emptying his vault. Harry and Ron become aurors with no idea about what Hermione is plotting.

Linkffn(The Arithmancer)

Science! Academia! Math! Magic! Figured out something interesting? Let's write an article about it! Maybe you'll get the Gamp prize!

Linkffn(Divided and Entwined)

Brutal war fic. When Voldemort gains influence and the Minister does nothing because 'Appeasement politics', when 'Don't buy from mudbloods' can be seen in Diagon Alley, when muggleborns get thrown out of Hogwarts, it's time to fight back. Luckily for Hermione, there's a lot of books about how a small number of guerilla fighters can bring down a country. Oh, and they have an excellent explosives expert on their team.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** *The secret language of plants series by Endrina*. Drarry but no Death Eater apologia. Socialist takeover of Hogwarts by radicalized Slytherin students. Harry dances houses into existence with his Walkman. No bashing except for slight Dumbledore bashing, basically the story takes canon Aberforth's opinion of Dumbledore as closer to the truth (he's brilliant and means well but isn't nearly as wise as people think he is, and he makes terrible mistakes). linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9323225]]; [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9476138]]; [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10181825]]; [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12821004]])

*Stealing Harry'verse by copperbadge*. Wolfstar. Sirius never goes to Azkaban and he and Remus move close to Privet Drive to keep an eye on Harry. They steal him when they realize the Dursleys are abusing him. Dumbledore makes them hide away in an unpronounceable Welsh village when the loss of the blood protection allows Death Eaters to attack Harry. Attempt at series re-write that sputters out in the third year, but is pretty original and exciting while it lasts. Has explicit interlude fics but the main stories I'm linking are T rating. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/987408]]; [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/992265]]; [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/992558]]; [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1000039]])

*boy with a scar series by dirgewithoutmusic* Various pairings that are not central. Stories are not a chronological series but rather re-imaginings of canon if things had gone a bit differently. Harry raised at Hogwarts. Ron or Neville being the BWL. If the Dursleys had died and Lily took Dudley in. If Petunia had raised Harry like a son. May leave you frustrated that amazing AU ideas were given such a swift treatment. I've linked the ones I like, there are more. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3454106]]; [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4308786]]; [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3073562]]; [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7809337]]; [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7900501]]; [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8158447]]; [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10566861]])

  What if Voldemort had chosen the pureblood boy, not the halfblood, as his opponent? This Neville would have had graves to visit, instead of a hospital. He'd still have grown up in his grandmother's clutches, tut-tutted at, dropped out windows absentmindedly, left to bounce on paving stones.Let's tell this story: Alice Longbottom, who was the better at hexing, told Frank to take Neville and run.

  When Petunia Dursley refused to take Harry in she forfeited his birthright protection, so Dumbledore took the baby to the safest place he knew: Hogwarts.The applicable staff (mostly just... not Snape) took Harry in on a rotating schedule as he grew from baby to toddler to child. They traded extra credit for babysitting among the older students, and Harry grew up knowing a few dozen different laps that were safe and warm to nap in.This was a Harry who grew up among books, among old transient walls and learned professors. They gave Binns night duty sometimes, and let him talk young Harry to sleep. This was a Harry whose world changed, on principle, daily. The stairs moved. The walls became doors. You had to keep your eyes open--you had to pay attention. So he did.He grew up in a school. Knowledge was power, but knowledge was also joy. This was his sanctuary. There was magic in his world from birth.

  What if, when Petunia Dursley found a little boy on her front doorstep, she took him in? Not into the cupboard under the stairs, not into a twisted childhood of tarnished worth and neglect---what if she took him in?Petunia was jealous, selfish and vicious. We will not pretend she wasn't. She looked at that boy on her doorstep and thought about her Dudders, barely a month older than this boy. She looked at his eyes and her stomach turned over and over. (Severus Snape saved Harry's life for his eyes. Let's have Petunia save it despite them).Let's tell a story where Petunia Dursley found a baby boy on her doorstep and hated his eyes---she hated them. She took him in and fed him and changed him and got him his shots, and she hated his eyes up until the day she looked at the boy and saw her nephew, not her sister's shadow. When Harry was two and Vernon Dursley bought Dudley a toy car and Harry a fast food meal with a toy with parts he could choke on Petunia packed her things and got a divorce.

  Harriet Lily Potter was left on the doorstep of 4 Privet Drive. They called her ugly and gave her Dudley's hand-me-downs. They would tell people that she went to a boarding school for troubled young women. Dudley still offered to stick her head in toilets, and she still learned to snap back, "Really, Duds? The poor toilet's never had anything as nasty as your head down it, it might hurt it," and run. Harry was the kind of girl who came home with scabby knees, who snuck the kitchen shears in the dead of night to snip her dark messy hair short. She wondered, as she curled up in her cupboard, if Vernon and Petunia would have loved a niece who was pretty instead of scrappy, who had soft hands and never burned the bacon at breakfast.

  Molly tried her best. When Harry had told them, Arthur had asked excitedly, "is this a Muggle thing?" Hermione had hurried out a "no!" and a frantic history of gender diversity in the wizarding world. "It's just that I'm a girl," Harry had said, and Arthur had nodded and asked her about how telephone booths worked. He would call her by the right pronouns until the day he died at the respectable old age of one hundred and thirty three, and he would make it seem easy. But Molly had to try. Hermione explained things faster and higher-pitched every time Molly messed up a pronoun. Molly frowned and muttered and put extra potatoes on Harry's plate at breakfast. Harry slept in Ron's room, which didn't bother either of them but which made Hermione scowl. Harry got boxes of sweets and warm hugs, as Molly chewed things over. For her fifteenth Christmas, the Weasley sweater she would receive would be a bright, friendly, terrible pink. The next time Harry visited, Molly put her on Ginny's floor to sleep-- for some definition of sleep that involved Hermione hissing threats at three in the morning if Harry and Ginny didn't "shut up about Wronski feints, do you know what time it is."

  On the train platform, Harry suffered a hug from Remus, a hair ruffle from Sirius, and a "don't do anything I wouldn't do" from his mother, and then he ran for the brick wall, cart rattling before him. The snowy owl they'd gotten him hooted softly in protest. Harry had named her Ororo after the Muggle comic books his mother had introduced him to. Lily took Harry to the comic store every time he sat through a whole visit with his aunt, uncle, and cousin and didn't kick anybody unless they kicked him first. Bill tried to wipe some dirt off a dodging Ron's nose. Ginny complained loudly about being left behind. Fred and George ran off to see Lee Jordan's spider. People watched the Weasleys from all directions--they were hard to miss--and Ron's shoulders slowly rose up and up to his reddening ears. He missed the big empty orchards behind the Burrow already. Ron was one of the last people on the train. He slid past staring eyes and finally stepped himself into an almost unoccupied compartment-- there was just one small boy tucked in there. He had messy dark hair, slightly askew round glasses, and a comic book held up in front of his nose. "Is it okay if I sit here?" said Ron. "Everywhere else is full."

  Lily remembered her sister, how there had been a time she was curious and delighted about magic, before it slowly sank in that she could look and not touch.The last thing Petunia had said to Lily before she died was a chilly goodbye, ending a holiday dinner where they'd had a shrieking row in the entryway. Petunia had said 'freak' and Lily had hissed 'better than this, better than this being my whole fucking world, Tune, do you even see yourself, are you happy--'And now here was Dudley Vernon Dursley fussing himself to sleep as Lily walked the halls of the Godric's Hollow house. His tiny soft hands with their tiny soft fingernails curled under her chin, the same way Harry's always had.She passed James, who was gently bouncing his way up the hall the opposite way. "I think he's asleep," James mouthed over Harry's tousled head.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

  Hank has stopped thinking about his place in the world for a long time. Old, washed-up cops don't live exciting lives. He just does what he always does: cracks cases, drinks whiskey, and goes home to Sumo.But then the android sent by CyberLife shows up -- disarmingly curious, intentionally uprooting all the familiar aspects of Hank's life, and he jumps headfirst into an android revolution. Barrels into cases like an unstoppable storm.Halfway through, Hank realizes he's no longer at the sidelines of his life. And that Connor makes it better. All of it.[Or alternatively: an episodic glimpse into the life of Hank Anderson and his partner Connor. Takes place after the revolution, happy ending included.]

  COMPLETE. When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost. It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything. (A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)
