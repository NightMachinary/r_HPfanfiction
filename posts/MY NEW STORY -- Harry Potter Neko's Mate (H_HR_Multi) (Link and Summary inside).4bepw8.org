Note: This story is only on Ao3 for now. My internet is being dumb, and won't let me get into my FFN account to upload the stories or anything. So only on Ao3, and will be on FFN ASAP!

Summary: Hermione's Polyjuice mishap in Second Year causes her to become a Neko! While visiting Hermione in the Hospital Wing, Harry discovers he's a Metamorphmagus. But that is not the only new discoveries for Harry and Hermione. What happens when they discover people they thought were friends and mentors have betrayed them? What will that mean for the future? And what does it mean to be a Neko's Mate?

Harry/Hermione/Multi (Padma, Parvati, Daphne, Gabrielle, and possibly Tonks late in story)


** What's the difference between the M and E rated stories on AO3?

*** I have no idea. My rating may have to be put up to Explicit soon enough. I have to research that.

** It's on my list to read tonight when I head to bed. I mostly clicked it because it was new, but also because I enjoy Metamorphmagus!Harry and Gender-Bender!Harry. Even or especially when they are combined. I actually greatly enjoy stories where harry just turns female and decides to spend most of his time that way, whether to just hide from being the BWL or for other reasons. I'll let you know or maybe leave a review after that.

*** The female!Harry in my story is an interesting storyline, how my plans will be going. He won't be female all the time, but he'll be it sometimes. Also, there is two versions of his female form. One, is Harry as a female. The other is Rose, a separate female personality, but still technically Harry. You'll learn more about her, and how this will affect the story in chapter 5 (and meet regular girl!Harry -- and Rose, in a way -- in chapter 4, though he does change back to male). Those will be posted in the next few days. (I have 11 chapters ready to post, but want to do them in intervals)

Edited to change chapter numbers.

**** Just finished reading both chapters. I'm enjoying it at the moment. Very nice. You did have one typo in the first chapter when Harry is talking to Ron where you typed ("Madam Pomfrey look quite worried about her, Ron" Hermione said.). I'll be looking for the new chapters as they come out.

Thanks for reading!
