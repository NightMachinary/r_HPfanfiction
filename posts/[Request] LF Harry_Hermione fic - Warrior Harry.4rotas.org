Hi Guys,

First request post as this has been bugging me for days and I must have searched through hundreds of fics.

Set in later years at Hogwarts, not sure if 6th or 7th. Harry finally shows up after being trained as a warrior by the order. Sirius is alive, Mad-Eye is a part of the training.

There is a Christmas scene with Harry and Hermione at the Grangers. Harry is learning about emotion. There is also a training obstacle course, which Hermione tries.

Hopefully that is enough to go on, it's been a while since I read it. Thanks in advance.


** I think that's linkffn(What we're fighting for by James Spookie). The action is good but the tone of it is so very John Carter/Doc Savage/Flash Gordon that Hermione becomes a damsel in distress to fit.

  The savior of magical Britain is believed dead until he shows up to fight Death Eaters. Hermione Granger is a very lonely young woman without a single friend until she boards the Hogwarts Express for her sixth year, and her life take a major turn. SERIOUS WARNING. Rated M for a reason. DO NOT READ if easily offended.

**** I think I started it a few months ago, but stopped after less than a chapter. The character who goes by the name of 'Harry Potter' is a Mary Sue OC superhero sex god iirc.

***** Definitely OC, and fairly powerful, but no sex god in this one. Quite a flawed Harry, actually, and does not always win. I think the story is worth checking out. Pretty solid grammar, pacing, plot structure... which puts it ahead of 95% of the stories out there. :)

****** I don't know, I didn't get very far. I remember that Hermione was randomly swooning over someone who was a stranger to her and was dressed in a /peculiar/ way at best. The author's description sounded like (iirc) a victorian gentleman crossed with Johnny Depp, rather than Harry Potter.

**** If you like a romance between a powerful, resourceful Harry and a helpless, pitiful Hermione, who really just wants to fall in love with a good, strong man who will treat her right and protect her, then this story is for you: it has all that, good grammar and spelling, and the dialogue flows fairly naturally.

If not...

  This is a what if story. Canon will be followed when it fits my story. Harry is powerful but not a superhero, Harry and Hermione the main pairing, rating may change down the road.
