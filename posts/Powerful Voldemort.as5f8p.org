I'm looking for fics with an incredibly talented, powerful, cunning, and evil Voldemort. Voldemort is supposed to be the darkest wizard in history, moreso than Grindelwald or others, even though in canon he did little outside of Britain. Years after he "died", people are still scared to say his name. He nearly managed to topple an entire government. He was charismatic enough and talented enough to get rich and influential purebloods to follow him, and got teachers, other students, and Hepzibah Smith to trust him. He also managed to open the chamber of secrets and create a horcrux while in school, even knowing nothing of magic for most of his life.

​

I want stories where Harry faces off against a truly menacing and brilliant opponent. I don't care if Harry himself is incredibly powerful or closer to canon, but I want something where the death eaters and Voldemort are truly evil and worthy of fear.


** Voldemort and Death Eaters are already evil, malicious, and sadistic enough in canon. However, they get handed idiot balls whenever the plot requires, and that unfortunately reduced their threat level.

I personally consider the Voldemort in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/Patron][Patron]], linkffn(11080542), to be the most threatening. This Voldemort got his good old looks back, is patient and methodical, and always has a viable plan B. On the other hand, Dumbledore is also on top of his game, and Harry is training hard. Even the Ministry is kind reasonable. In the end, the good guys have to resort to the darkest ritual, as canon Horcrux Hunt would have never worked!

In this fic, Dumbledore is MUCH more grey, and does some fairly questionable stuff.

***** The canon questionable stuff is generally not helpful, if not at least slightly counterproductive, to the good guys' cause. Canon Dumbledore is an "adults are useless" character.

The one in Patron does some unpleasant things to win the war and is an "I do what I must, little though I like it" character.

The difference between Neville Chamberlain and Bomber Harris, basically.

That might be true, but the whole solution of the plot relies on Harry sacrificing himself. It's ridiculous that Dumbledore's plan worked out in the end, because he's useless, but it did and Harry being a sacrificial lamb was the entire point of his endeavors.

#+begin_quote
  "I do what I must, little though I like it"
#+end_quote

Which is almost literally canon!Dumbledore's justification for his treatment of Harry.

Rising a child to martyr himself in the end in order to win a war that you can't win on your own is pretty morally abhorrent to me.

I don't exactly recall Dumbledore's action in Patron though.

It's even worse if you count up all of the mystical and magical traditions in which a sacrifice is marred by despair - and its necessary rejection of the divine power to intercede, rendering the martyr unwilling and therefore invalid - which is what Dumbledore is relying on to drive Harry to that final meeting with Voldemort.

Harry's death wasn't self-sacrifice, it was a suicide and if it wasn't for the merest chance of Tom's confusion about the magical artefact he'd stolen from Dumbledore's grave, it would thereby have been for nothing. It wasn't even a valid sacrifice by Dumbledore, since Dumbledore had good reason to believe Harry would be able to take at least one Killing Curse from Tom without dying, so he knew, or at least didn't sincerely believe, he was rendering up Harry's life as an offering.

He had no reason to strongly believe this. He just hoped there might be a chance for Harry to survive. It's not like Nagini got a second shot at survival just because she was a living Horcrux.

If Harry had died it would have been upon the other fighters, who'd now have been protected by his love sacrifice magic, to defeat Voldemort.

The death stick isn't actually unbeatable you know?

  Having been treated as a servant his entire life, Harry is more sympathetic when Dobby arrives, avoiding Vernon's wrath and gaining a bit of freedom. That freedom changes his summer, his life, and the world forever. A very long character-driven story that likes to play with canon.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
