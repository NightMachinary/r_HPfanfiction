:END:
I'm trying to remember a Harry/Ginny story that involved Marriage Law/Contracts.

Ginny was pissed at Harry for all the betrothal contracts he was being sent so Harry made a magical vow that he would not marry anyone who sent him a contract.

Unfortunately for Ginny her parents or Dumbledore (can't remember who) sent Harry a contract on her behalf.

Thanks.
