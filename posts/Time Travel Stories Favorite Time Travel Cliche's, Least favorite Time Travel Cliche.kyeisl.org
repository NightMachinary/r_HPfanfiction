Favorite Time Travel Stories, least favorite? What do you like about time travel stories, what don't you like?

Any minor annoyances that just irk you for really petty reasons? etc.

For me: I hate how someone, (usually Harry) Ends up going back in time. And the same things still happen, just told slightly different. Like characters still dying, or Draco still getting the Remembrall Ball, etc. Just things like that.

Or someone (usually Harry), goes back to the Marauder's Era, ends up being friends with/or hanging out with the Marauders, or Lily or whoever. And doesn't even attempt to destroy the Horocruxes. Like bro, you know what they are, you know (mostly anyway at this point), where they are. Destroy them before Voldemort finds out, so Trelawney doesn't give the Prophecy and Snape doesn't overhear it.

Something relatively minor that annoys me (Though I will often still read depending on how the rest of the story is). Harry renames himself something similar to James, I understand family loyality, but when it's something like Albert Jameson or something, that's just too much.

Sirius still falling through the veil and other things like the tri wizard tournament happening pretty much exactly like it is in the canon books. You're a fanfiction writer, not a canon author. Do something different!

Maybe have Harry, Snape or whoever it is that goes back, reveal that Barty Crouch Jr is pretending to be Moody, or before that happens, tell Amelia Bones or one of the Order Members that are Auror's that Crouch Jr is alive and living at Crouch Sr's house, etc. Just something.

But, even with the things I don't like, I tend to find myself still reading time travel stories regardless if they have those tropes or not.

What about you? What are tropes you like/hate, time travel stories you think do a job, etc?


** I'll stop reading when "we can't change the past. We have to protect the time line" I mean, what's so great about the time line anyway? You are in the past, fix the problem.

And another thing that I can't handle is when they try to hook up with their romantic interest who is a child and the time traveler is much older.

*** First reason would be the resulting paradox. If you remove the problem, you remove your reason for going back. Depending on how far you go back, you possibily end your end existance.

Another reason, even if you stay constant yourself with no paradox, might be that you are highly invested in your timeline. For example if you had a child in your time line. Removing the problem might lead to a different timeline where you didn't meet your significant other and thus never had that child.

Could be an interesting conflict for adult Harry: Travel back and defeat Voldemort. Alt-Harry then gets raised as a normal child by the Potters. But since he will be so different and live through different times, even if he marries Alt-Ginny, he will have other children than James, Lily and Albus. Would original Harry sacrifice them that way?

**** Well, there are a few views of temporal theory:

*The Non-Deterministic Tragic View of Time Travel*

If you travel back in time, you must be unexisting the people who existed. This is because for time travel to serve a purpose, the future must not be set, if the future isn't set then you've erased it by going back. If that's a price you're not willing to pay, suffer with what you have. If it's not a loop, then your mere presence, the slight smile as you see a loved one, will rip apart the future you used to have in an instant. /Anything/ you do differently will cause ripples because the timeline will be functioning differently, so your only choice is to sit by and watch, attempting to things exactly the same while you sentence everyone who suffered or died to those same fates. But you'll never get your loved ones back because no one's memory is perfect, no one can perfectly replicate years of minute details.

*The Rowling View of Time Travel*

Time-Travel is a stable loop. Never use this. It's pointless because it has no stakes. Nothing can be changed, so we've seen what will happen, regardless of the existence of your fanfiction. The ultimate canon-compliance.

*The Multiverse View of Time Travel*

*/Stable Version/*

Since all potential time-lines happen at once, your traveling is more akin to dimension-hopping, with you essentially hopping into a new reality where you will make all the changes you would want to change. You're not changing the original timeline, you're just going somewhere else. You're not quite deleting your loved ones in the active sense, just abandoning them to the ravages of the timestream you left them in.

*/Unstable Version/*

The classic branching multiverse. Going back in time gives you a chance to rebuild the tree from the point you go back to. Time resumes as normal, but you're back in time now. See above abandoning of all loved ones to the ravages of the timestream you left them in.

*The Back to the Future View of Time Travel*

There is one timeline. Going back alters this singular timestream. Mechanisms of time travel like a Tardis are unaffected by shifts to the timestream, as they exist outside it. One wrong step erases your loved ones from existence, and you might have to fight a deathmatch with yourself to get them back.

*The Soul to the Past View of Time Travel*

This is a generally used mechanic throughout fanfiction, where you send your consciousness back to your body at a prior point in the timeline. It doesn't matter what version of timelines exist, as you're ignoring them all, and just reloading a saved game. The most efficient way to give up your particular timeline's loved ones.

*Grandfather Paradox*

You can travel as much as you want, but time itself will prevent you from interfering. You are unable to do anything that would stop you from time-traveling. So if you wanted to save a life, you wouldn't be able to. But hey! At least you'll get to keep your loved ones when you come back to your original time. They might be able to make you feel better for not changing anything. The time travel exists, but it's kind of a useless version. Not to mention I lied, you'll probably end up changing stupid, like your family's personalities,

** I love stable time loops. Spoilers: Timely Errors has Harry fight Voldemort during a Hogsmeade attack in Marauder's time. Voldemort heard someone call him Harry, and by looks he's obviously a Potter. Tom is laughing off the Prophecy when someone reports a Harry Potter was just born.

** I dislike Peggy Sue time travel that results in adults in children's bodies in relationships with actual children.

I like time travel that results in interesting relationships that would have an unacceptable age gap otherwise, or that would be impossible without time travel. Give me your HarryxMerope, your HarryxEileen Prince, your Harry!Minerva, your Harry!Grindelwalds. I don't like to read gross age gaps or power imbalances in relationships, but time travel that equalizes those things makes for a lot more possibilities.

** Some of my favorite ideas surrounding time travel are rarely (read: never) done in HP fanfiction.

The biggest one being that there would have to be a period of adjustment and orientation for whomever traveled through time. I can't tell you how frustrating it is to read variations of “oh, we're in X time now, neat” and the only thing the characters feel the need to touch on is the fact that they time traveled and how to rationalize it. There is so much more to time travel than the act of traveling itself!

Depending on the time separating the past from the future the traveler left, they'd have to first come to grips with the fact that they'd traveled through time. Unless that was precisely what the character had intended to do, it is NOT the first rational explanation someone would come to when they live in a world that has teleportation, floo, portkeys, and countless other methods of casually fucking with physics. Time travel, even when accounting for the existence of time turners, is NOT a normal, rational OR easily recognizable phenomenon in the HP universe. In fact, I'd go so far as to argue time travel would be the very LAST option people consider when trying to figure out what happened precisely BECAUSE time turners exist. They have short-term time travel, so they'd naturally assume long-term time travel would be exactly like that.

That isn't even getting into the process they'd have to go through just to reach the conclusion that they'd traveled through time, let alone accept it.

On top of all that they'd have to worry about disease and some linguistic drift if they traveled backward in time. Traveling around ten years or more backward would be akin to dropping a weapon of viral/bacterial warfare unless precautions are taken specifically to counter it. Then they'd have to get used to the way people (used to) speak, the words they use that no longer mean what the traveler knew them to mean, and even their own accent would likely have changed at least a little from what it should be in the period they traveled to by merit of simply having aged!

I absolutely /hate/ that time travel is used so frequently by HP fanfiction writers as if it were just a tool they can use to justify the stuff they're writing about happening.

** I love a reset when harry dies in the final battle or during the tournament and goes back farther to fix things saving Sirius and everyone else. Especially when soul mates are involved regardless of the pairing.

I hate when its revealed that ron and ginny were using using potions to ensnare harry and all they wanted was his fame and money or just excessive weasley bashing. I'm fine with it if harry has an opportunity to prevent it and remain friends with all the weasleys though

** I hate it when there are deviations and changes that are not caused by the time travel itself. Takes me right out of the story, like am I reading time travel or AU?

Edit: Also I hate when the time traveler doesn't capitalise on their future knowledge and tries to let it play out the same, to 'preserve their advantage' or something. Everybody who remotely has heard of the butterfly effect knows that that is effectively impossible, also what is the point of time travel then?

Also have you ever noticed that nobody who learns of the time travel ever seems to have a problem that the younger overwritten self is effectively dead?

*** For pretty much the first four books, I'm going to let it play out mostly canon in my story. However, Harry's going to be in Slytherin this time and a lot of the events that happen in canon will be something I won't really touch on. Second year will be a significant deviation since Harry's not going to reveal he's a Parselmouth, and third year's mainly going to involve Harry navigating the politics in Slytherin with a touch of madman!Sirius in the background.

The politics won't be something ridiculous or anything. I don't really plan on having a "king" or anything, but I will have the more politically powerful people in Slytherin "in charge" so to speak and people will want to be their friends/allies. The whole Lords and Ladies and Ancient Houses is something that I'm using, but it's not going to be something like "My House is more powerful than yours, bow down bitches" or anything like that. It's basically going to be a title that says that they're important people in the wizarding world because they will be a part of wizarding parliament in the future. The fact that Harry's the heir to two Houses will just make him slightly more sought after as an ally since he can provide more "back up" or whatever if someone wants to pass a bill.

The summer before fifth year will be the "Summer of Changes" where canon begins to spiral out of control. It'll be the start of Heir Potter of House Potter and Black and that kind of shit. This'll be the beginning of Harry using his political power (as the heir to two Wizengamot houses and as the Boy-Who-Lived) to warn people about Voldemort and to try and free Sirius. Sixth year will be when Harry starts to participate in the Wizengamot.

** I hate:

- can't fix the past

- despite the character changing past, everything is still canon

- characters being stupid. (why would time traveling Draco think the bad guy in the first year was Snape?)

- not saving characters despite being able to

- when the character travels to a time when it's already too late for something. (like if Harry time travels to the exact moment of Cedric's death, not being able to save him)

- bashing, goblins, master of death, OP Harry

- alternative universe, esp. if the universe is different from theirs

- dream/purgatory sequence

- telling Dumbledore

I love:

- when other characters are important that weren't important in canon, or at least the time traveler befriending them. (no one ever befriends Neville. ugh)

- adult Harry saving little Harry from the Dursleys

*** Snark lists are fun.

- can't fix the past

The canon approach, done without the justification of canon.

- despite the character changing past, everything is still canon

I've never seen The Butterfly Effect.

- characters being stupid. (why would time-traveling Draco think the bad guy in the first year was Snape?)

It's for the plot, man-Rick Riordan on Heroes of Olympus

- not saving characters despite being able to

Eh, I didn't like them anyway.

- when the character travels to a time when it's already too late for something. (like if Harry time travels to the exact moment of Cedric's death, not being able to save him)

Gotta set that tone.

- bashing, goblins, master of death, OP Harry

That's not how lists work. Let me show you:

-bashing

Because you got tricked the first time, time to try again.

-goblins

Ooh, let me guess. He'll meet the king of the goblins, and the king's name will be Ragnock, and will declare Harry friend to the goblin nation.

-master of death

Can't let Harry keep the minor emotional development of giving up items that give him power over death, he needs more /power!/

-OP Harry

Stakes are for wusses.

- alternative universe, esp. if the universe is different from theirs

I signed up for the one-way time trip, not the dimension-hopping excursion, I'd like to call your manager!

- dream/purgatory sequence

LSD isn't cheap. Enjoy the effects while you can.

- telling Dumbledore

I mean, he gives out candy. Free candy, man!

I have seen this work once, (I read the story years ago and cant find it again). Basically they change things, but through some other mechanism events still play out the same. So the next time they take more action and even more things have to line up to keep the plot fixed.

So they instead of trying to prevent things, have to let them play out but then be prepared for that event.

It might have played with the Doctor Who "fixed points in time" concept where certain things are always going to happen but I am not sure.

** I agree with most of the comments made already. One other thing I dislike is when people go down the 'tell Dumbledore right away' route, for example in stories set in the Marauders era, lots of times Harry or whoever travelled back then gets enrolled in the school under a slightly false name and disguise with some story about having been home schooled before or moved from some fictional school. He's then allowed to freely roam around the school with all of his future knowledge, and usually Dumbledore gives him no more than a cursory 'don't mess with ye olde timeline' warning and that's it. I always think that in reality, Dumbledore couldn't take the risk of time travellers from the future interacting with /anyone/.

I imagine though that time travel stories are very difficult to write. I don't follow the science involved myself. I've read a number of time travel stories but none of them seem quite right and I usually give up part way through.
