My aim is to update every month, every six weeks at the latest. So, give it a look, tell me what you think. Any and all comments are welcome.


** I'm always in favor of Dresden crossovers, and this doesn't look too bad. Word to the wise though, watch your tenses. More than once you went from past to present, and it's particularly jarring.

**** You probably already read and post on [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/][DLP]], because I've found that most HP/Dresden fans do, but if you don't, it's a good place to drop by for betaing. People there are quite experienced, and it's far easier than trying to fix off of FF.net, with their retarded anti copy/paste settings in place.

***** I do not! However, I'm headed to bed, so I shall do so on the morrow.

Note to self: never say 'on the morrow' again.
