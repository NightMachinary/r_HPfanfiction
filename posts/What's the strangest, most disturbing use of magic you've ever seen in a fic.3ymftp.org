** There was some weird as fuck one where Voldemort wanted to keep Harry as a pet, so he turned him partially into a leopard? And supposedly made parts of the transformation non-reversible so like, he didn't have hands and feet but paws instead, and a tail, and he couldn't talk anymore just make leopard noises. There are no sex involved, thankfully, just torture where they kept him in a too-small cage and dragged him out to "train" him and have him sit at the foot of Voldemort's throne. It was messed up.

A 30 year old time traveling into their 11 year old body is still mentally 30.

It's basically like taking a deaging potion to sex up a minor (which I thankfully have not run into.)

**** It negates the need for women to continue the race of wizards and in a society that already has more then a few problems with bigotry I don't think that's a place a want to go to.

It's also a problem with realism. Okay, so someone figured out how to turn himself into an animal and back. Seems useful. But why would there be a way for two gay men to get pregnant with on another if wizading England is let's say not quite caught up with modern times and being gay only became legal in the UK in 1967? Not just that but there is a lot more needed to carry out a pregnacy then just a womb and a hole to get the kid out of and let's not mention the possible genetical problems if you by chance get a child with two y-chromosomes. You could just say "magic fixes everything" but those kind of stories are usually boring at best.

Appart from that it's just not something I enjoy reading. I always feel that if whichever couple really wanted a child they could adopt (there are more than enough orphrans in need of loving homes in the HP universe, starting with Riddle and ending with everyone who lost their parents to either of the two wars) or find a surrogate mother. But that's just my oppinion.

****** Well actually there is kinda a basis against women, especially in the early books, when the only magical women we see are housewives like Molly and Narcissa, or old spinsters like McGongall. Even non magically: the Dursleys, have stay-at-home mother and employed, head-of-the-household father. Apart from Bones, (and Umbridge, who I hate to say actually is a postive role model in this fashion), in just the books there are very few examples of women with highly ranked jobs, and they both are unmarried (Tonks also falls into this for most of the series). Outsider of the books there is background to powerful women in the past, but this doesn't really count. And don't even start with veelas...

***** I can understand the drive of a couple to have children that are biologically theirs, rather then adopt. Especially considering the way blood family/inheritance is treated in Harry Potter (can you see Draco Malfoy accepting raising someone else's child?)

As for the medical aspects, it is /currently/ possible for a male to carry a child, namely via Ectopic implantation. But as the famous quote goes, "If a man does have a successful pregnancy, can he survive it?", as removal of the fetus would be the most harmful part, involving surgery. In a world of blood potions etc, the answer would be yes, easily. It would not be necessary for all children to have two Y chromosomes, depending on how the process occurs. For example, half of a males sperm contains the X chromosome (which, when combine with the always X chromosome of the egg results in a girl baby).

That is not to say I agree with Mpreg as a plot device. I have no idea why anyone, male or female, would want to carry a parasitic growth for 9 months if there are other options available. The joy of childbirth is a lie, and pregnant people are not happy or romance inclined. If you need a baby to keep the story going and your leads together there is something seriously wrong.

The only real difference here is that most if not all are still attached to the uterus in some way (which of course is lacking in males). But really if you can attach the placenta (or whatever it would be called) to the right place in the intestines or maybe liver, the exchange of nutrients and waste would be just as good. This is to say, impregnation via anal sex would not be practicable, as that would mean attachment to the colon, which isn't a great place for nutrients to be absorbed from. But if it was via some sort of magic potion....

**** The concept squicks me out, for one. I have enough respect for women who go through pregnancy, I don't want to experience it myself.

There's also the fact that from everything I've heard, most people use it as an excuse to feminize - not homosexualize, but /feminize/ - male characters while keeping them male, often to the point where they're essentially a female housewife in a male's body. Any gay man can tell you that a gay male is still -male- with all the gender identity that they grew up with.

Oh, and don't forget the sub/dom relationship that usually comes with it.

Indeed, that. Because (ignoring the jumps in logic one has to make for male pregnancy to be something that isn't pure nonsense) the reason many people are ... not very positively inclined towards male pregnancy, is that it is a symptom of this particular illness of fiction writing.

There was a comedy movie with male pregnancy as its central theme and people didn't have problems with it because it didn't do that crap. But many, way too many, I'd even risk it and say that almost all, people who write fan fiction featuring male pregnancy, do end up with it.

*** That is hillarious and could easily have been an interesting story if it wasn't about poorly described anal sex.

Magical bodydomination parasites are not that implausible in a world with magic.

Hell, that'd be a way to do a full arc: Harry Potter, Boy Who Lived, survives because a magic parasite is /keeping/ him alive. As he grows up, Harry gets flashbacks to previous hosts for the parasite, and eventually, when he encounters the shade of Voldemort, realises that the boy that was Harry Potter never was in control of his life.

Then it starts wondering if its friends were made due to the coincidences they seemed or because the parasite was influencing its actions.

So body horror mixed with the Venom arc in Spider-Man.
