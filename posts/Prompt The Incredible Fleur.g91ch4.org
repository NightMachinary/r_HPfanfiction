Fleur Delacour has serious anger management issues. Which are made even more serious by the fact that getting angry means growing feathers and throwing fireballs. But after reading a comic about the Hulk, she decides to get her anger under control and use it for good. Voldemort is about to learn why you should never anger a Veela.
