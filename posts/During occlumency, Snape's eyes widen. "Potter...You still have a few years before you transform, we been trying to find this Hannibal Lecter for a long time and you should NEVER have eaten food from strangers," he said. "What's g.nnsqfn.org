Harry is confused and worried. He noticed Snape seem shocked when he sees the nice man giving a container of loin pork with baked potatoes to a younger Harry when the Dursleys weren't watching.

"What is "too late"? And who is this Hannibal?" said Harry in a demanding tone.

"Well, witches and wizards are not supposed to eat a certain type meat or there will be dire consequences... Children will be fine until they're fully grown," said Snape.

"What certain meat?" said Harry.

Severus just looks sadly at the boy and Harry's eyes widen in a horrified realization. He then begins to feel sick and runs to vomit.

  It was easier for Will to hide his magic. No muggle understood his â€˜gift' of empathy. Wizarding kind thought him even more of a freak. No person, magical or otherwise, liked their secrets exposed. While Will was self-taught in magic, it was easier to deal with people without magic, than with it.Hannibal Lecter had an important and rare creature inheritance that gifted him with understanding magic in a way that few could understand. Secret hidden from all, even Will, he slipped under the cover of the muggles, an elusive sort of prey, and killed without magic.Only, when Hannibal asks Will of his magic, that Will understands who Hannibal is: Chesapeake Ripper.So, they both leave. Will leaves Jack behind but brings his dogs, and Hannibal is looking forward to hunting in Italy again. On their layover in England, Hannibal confesses that he needs to go hunting. That is where they found Harry Potter, curled under the cupboard, malnourished and bleeding.The natural thing to do is take the boy in and raise him as their own.This is the story of how Harry grows with a father who is a Ravenstag, serial killer, a dad with too many dogs and an empathy disorder, cannibalism and the value that family has.
