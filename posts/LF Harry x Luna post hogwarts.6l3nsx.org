Title is self explanatory, but I'd prefer it to be focused purely on the relationship between the two.

** Oh boy, here we go! You came to the right place!

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7680982/1/Unspeakable-Beauty]])

Probably one of my favorite H/L fics I've ever read: Harry is an Auror and Luna is an Unspeakable. Luna is a bit more grown-up in this story than the girl filled with child-like wonder whom we know from the books, but her wistful side definitely remains. Other characters and their relationships are emphasized later in the story, but the first nine chapters are pure Lunarry goodness.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12332867/1/An-Unbelievable-Adventure]])

A sweet, fun little one-shot adventure / exploration.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5195541/1/Luna-s-Surprises]])

A rather saucy little one-shot.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12518962/1/Moments-in-Bed-with-Harry-and-Luna-A-Sketchbook]])

Some cute snapshots of Harry and Luna at various stages in their relationship, including what may be the loveliest proposal ever.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2707966/1/It-s-Not-Lying-if-it-s-Christmas]])

A nice seasonal story where Luna blurts out to the Weasley grandkids that there's no such thing as Santa Claus - and then, with a little help from Harry, tries to correct her mistake.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8768575/1/Crack-Investigator]])

Harry as an Auror, Luna as an investigative reporter. The story isn't told in chronological order, which is a little odd, but it's quite sweet and humorous.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3811482/1/How-Did-This-Happen]])

Harry as Auror, Luna as reporter again - but this time it's more somber in tone. After granting Luna an interview, Harry sleeps with her - but is it a mistake or a new beginning?

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1986049/1/Harry-and-Luna-s-Answering-Machine]]), linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8619117/1/Luna-and-the-Toaster]]), linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9135726/1/Cooking-with-Luna]])

Finally, some general fluff and silliness involving everyday household objects to round this list out.

  It was always their most private place: the place where they could truly be at their most open and vulnerable with each other.

** Back with a couple stories from AO3 to add to my long FFN list (I see "Tomorrowland" has already been mentioned):

"A Life So Very Much Less Than Ordinary" linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/31644?view_adult=true]])

Harry and Luna re-encounter each other in middle-age after things fall apart between Harry and Ginny. Contains lemons, limes, and some odd background parings (Ginny/Scorpius, I kid you not). Also worth reading because we get to see Luna as a potential stepmother to Harry's kids, something you don't see in fics that often. (I think most of us prefer an AU where Luna is Harry's first wife, rather than his second.)

"Keeping a Promise over the Years" linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2534036]])

Starts at Hogwarts pre-DH, but is mostly focused on the years post-Hogwarts, stretching all the way into old age. What if Harry was married to Ginny and Luna was married to Rolf, just like in canon, while H & L also had a lifelong secret relationship? You may not agree with the morality of it, but I think you'll find it's an interesting concept. Be forewarned that this story contains some non-explicit allusions to sexual/emotional trauma.

"Courting Luna Lovegood" linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/387057?view_adult=true]])

Thanks to a drunken incident at a party, the Wizarding community assumes that Harry had a one-night-stand with Luna (which he didn't). Everything Harry does to try and make the scandal go away only makes it worse, and of course Luna doesn't care what anybody else thinks. And, as it turns out, that's what makes him fall in love with her. Contains lemons and limes.
