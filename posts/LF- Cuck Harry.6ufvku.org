I like to find a fic where Harry is a cuck and preferably a character in the fic saying "YER A CUCK Harry". I found one fic of that sort, relished on the tears of Harry Potter. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12437390/1/Malfoy-s-Promise]]

Edit: The reviews of that fic are not so good but it is well written

  I, personally, don't like him.

Then why read his book, and fanfiction about him?

******* Because the series isn't entirely about him and because you can read a book even if you don't like certain characters.
