I know this probably isn't very popular on most of these sites, but any Favorite Snape raises Harry fics. I love Another Snape meets the Dursley's and a more realistic one is In Blood Only.


** I'm currently reading linkffn(3 Slytherin Marauders). It's the first Snape raising Harry fic so I can't really compare. Although in linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) Snape did babysit Harry a few times while Sirius was accompanying Remus during full moon nights.

  Harry & Dudley flee an abusive Vernon to Severus Snape. Severus finds a new home for himself & the boys with dragons and hunt the Horcruxes from there. The dragons, especially one become their allies. Tom R is VERY different.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

** For a pretty common premise, I can't think of any standout examples. The Calista Snape series is probably the best I've read. The writing is technically excellent and characters are fleshed out and faithful to canon. Unfortunately, there's never much plot or urgency --- from sixth year onwards it seriously starts to drag. The early years are a delight to read though.

(Technically Snape is raising his own daughter here, not Harry. I assume you're okay with non-Harry protagonists though.)

#+begin_quote
  A realistic Snape's daughter story. Severus Snape discovers he has a daughter, born of a brief affair with Bellatrix Lestrange. First, a journey to reach the frightened, emotionally damaged child, and then a full-blown mental war, as Bellatrix manages to possess the girl from her cell in Azkaban. Among other things, an in-depth exploration of Occlumency. AU, in-character Snape.

  COMPLETE. Sequel to "Always in Your Shadow". Severus Snape's daughter Calista attends Hogwarts. As if Occlumency lessons, peer rivalry, and growing up Snape weren't challenging enough, she still has to contend with her dangerous, sadistic mother, Bellatrix Lestrange, trying to invade her mind. AU, in-character; CC where possible. In-depth exploration of the art of Occlumency.

#+begin_quote
  Third in series. Snape's daughter fic. After graduating from Hogwarts, Calista Snape's plans include a new career at St. Mungo's, working with the Committee for Experimental Charms, and building her relationship with her boyfriend, Gerald Boot --- but shadows and blood still follow her and her father, as the Second Wizarding War approaches. AU, but all in-character; well-written.

  Rather than allowing Harry to stay at Diagon Alley after he blew up Aunt Marge, the Ministry sends Harry back to the Dursleys. Harry returns to school after a terrible summer, to find that he's not the only one with this kind of secret. A student has been killed by his family. New screening measures are put into place by the Ministry: Every student must be given a medical exam and interview to look for child abuse. With Dumbledore facing an inquiry, Snape is entrusted with the task of making sure EVERYONE receives one. Answer to the "New measures for screening abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. The first chapter contains a character death and the whole story is quite dark. It begins at the beginning of Prisoner of Azkaban and is AU thereafter. Also note: this story is a "Snape is Harry's biological dad" story. This is not supposed to be the central theme of the story, but people have gotten annoyed that I didn't tell them at the beginning. Another note: There are no pairings in this story, or explicit sexual content. There are, however, mentions of homosexuality. Since there are no pairings, there is no slash content, but if the mere mention of homosexuality offends you, read something else.
