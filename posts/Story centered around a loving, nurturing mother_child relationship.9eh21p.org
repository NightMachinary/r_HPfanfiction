So without getting too personal, I've had a bit of a rough time in my life, and my relationship with my mom is...rocky to say the least. Because of that, I've found myself really falling in love with fics with a mother figure and child, whether it be an abuse fic, fluff, or anyone between. The characters themselves don't really quite matter (though I have quite a liking to Lily/Harry), but what does is that warm and fuzzy feeling I get from those stories that I might not feel in real life.

So then...any good fics like that you can recommend in that oddly specific category? Thanks!


** I'm a sucker for those too! I have a lot more luck finding father-son type dynamics, probably because most of Harry's pseudo parental relationships are with men. But I've found a few Molly Weasley gems that might suit your purposes.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14058597][Clock by Destril]] is about Harry being added to that wonderful Weasley clock.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9533681][Seventh Son by squirenonny]] about Harry and Molly during Deathly Hallows.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2150022][Apple Slices and Cocoa by FeathersMcStrange]] is about Harry learning to trust Molly.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2151594][The Happy Smiles Recipe by MayMarlowe]] is about the Weasleys helping Harry cope with Sirius's death.

They're all somewhat short and not perfect, but they scratch an itch and make you feel comforted. Hope you enjoy them!

** Funnily enough I don't remember ever reading a fic centered around a (healthy) mother/child relationship. There are some that focus on Harry with kids (Grow Young With Me comes to mind), but none focused on single mothers, at least in what I've read. Full Circle has some cuteness with a time traveling Hermione being a mom to young!Harry, but it's not necessarily the focus of it. linkffn(7150729)

**** In my experience, fics with both parents tend to focus at least 50% if not more on the father figure, so I figured the best way to find a mom centered fic would be one where no dad is in the picture.

Regardless, I hope you enjoy it and hope it helps

** I don't know that it's strictly "centered" (perhaps others who have read to completion could say), but there is mothering as a through line in all of the early chapters, and am fairly certain this continues.

** What's funny is that I haven't spoken to my father since I was a preteen and I find myself drawn to Sirus/Harry, Remus/Harry and even Severus/Harry mentor fics no matter how OOC they can be sometimes. It's interesting how we can try to heal ourselves by reading fanfictions that give us a taste of what we don't have.

Sorry I have no recs but I do hope you find some good ones :)

** Not about biological parents, but I can offer you something for the mother roles.

I'm writing a story where Harry gets adopted by the Tonks family, with Andromeda becoming something between mother and aunt while Nymphadora becomes something between an older sister and a mother figure. It isn't an instantaneous process but a gradual change from "so that's how a normal family looks like" to "my family". Canonical child abuse is mentioned a couple of times, but there's very little angst, just a mixture of fluff and slice of life.

** Storm of Yesterday by Shayalonnie is amazing. Its Hermione/James. It's one of my favorite fics.

Summary: Hunted by Voldemort, Hermione and Harry make a last stand in Godric's Hollow. When the Boy-Who-Lived lives no more, Hermione is thrown back in time into another battle where she has a chance to save not only Harry, but another Potter.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8850352/chapters/20295151]]

Another one I absolutely love is Rise of the Drackens by StarLight_Massacre on ao3. It's Harry/Draco/Blaise/OMC/OMC. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/384548/chapters/629550]]

Summary: Harry comes into a very unexpected inheritance. He is a creature both rare and very dangerous, a creature that is black listed by the British Ministry. So now he must avoid detection at all costs, whilst choosing his life partners and dealing with impending pregnancy at just sixteen. With danger coming not just from the Ministry but even other creatures, what was he supposed to do?

I think I'd also have to add The Debt of Time by Shayalonnie to this list as well. It's ultimately Hermione/Sirius. But, there is also Hermione/Remus, and theres also one scene that is pretty famous amongst the fandom that is SPOILERS!!!: Hermione/Sirius/Remus. I feel like I should tell you though that the nurturing mother in this SPOILERS!!!: passes away near the end of the fic. I don't know if you'd want to read that right now. And if you don't, that's cool. But, I definitely suggest reading it at a later time, because it's one of the greatest fics ever. IMHO. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10672917/chapters/23626929]]

Summary: When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner.
