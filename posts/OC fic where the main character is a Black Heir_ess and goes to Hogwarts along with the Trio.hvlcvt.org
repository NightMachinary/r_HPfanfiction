No matter how many filters I apply on ao3 I'm having a hard time finding good (and complete!) fics about a long lost Sirius' child or an unknown Regulus' child that happens to attend school with the trio, all throughout the years and the war. Have you found any story with a similar concept? Thank you!


** I know some on ffn, but I've never read them, so I can say nothing of the quality:

Alexander Chronicals, Black Bond, and Black as Night.

  Despite her best efforts, Elizabeth Potter is repeatedly drawn into situations she wants absolutely nothing to do with. People just refuse to leave her the hell alone.

  Harriet Potter has always been odd. Between having a shadow that moves on its own and chatting with snakes in the garden, learning she's a witch really isn't the strangest thing that's happened to the bespectacled girl with a lightning scar on her neck. [Fem!Harry, Slytherin!Harry, AU Retelling]

  The House of Black still stands. The House of Black will always stand. But what happened after Hallowe'en 1981? Dynastic feuds, family politics and maybe, just maybe, a hope which can be found in the dark of night, and the darkest of hearts. Not your typical Sirius-has-a-daughter story. Rated M. Complete.
