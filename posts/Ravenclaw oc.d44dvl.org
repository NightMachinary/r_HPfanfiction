A girl who plays the violin with her wand with string attached to make magic music, I'm not creative enough to come up with anything more so I'd like to hear what you guys have to say


** Sounds like one thing Ravenclaw seems to miss a lot in the fandom: they aren't all smart researchers poring over their books. They're creative and inspired and follow their hobbies wildly. Sounds like a nice quirk to me!

** Sounds pretty interesting. What's her purpose in whatever story you're writing?

** This sounds like a delightful quirk and I think you can develop this into a great story!

When it comes to developing characters, the key is to ask plenty of questions.

So this girl plays the violin with her wand to make magical music.

*Power*

- What sort of magical effects, if any, are there with her music?

- Is it simply better than any Muggle music, or is there actual effects?

- Can the music make plants grow supernaturally quickly?

- Can the music be used offensively or defensively or even as healing?

- Can the music produce visual effects to accompany it?

- Can the music produce strong emotional manifestations, sort of like a pseudo-Patronus?

- Does this magical music only work with the girl's violin? Can it work with other instruments? Or is the power innate in her? Why is she drawn towards the violin?

*Setting*

- When in the HP timeline is this set?

- Are Harry and friends at Hogwarts?

- Or is this before, or after, their time?

Having an OC is all well and good, but you still need people to bounce off her.

*The Girl*

- How does the music affect the girl?

- Is music in general something she is drawn towards, and if so, does it affect her classwork?

- Is there some other trait the girl has? If she's musically and magically inclined, perhaps she has synesthesia? To grossly oversimplify, that's a condition that has the patient experience two senses simultaneously.

Linkffn(3675358) has Luna's mother experiencing synesthesia, specifically she can see sounds as colors. Perhaps your OC has something similar?

- Does she have any other quirks that go with the music making? Many musicians perform without wearing shoes, so I wouldn't be surprised if your OC decided to walk around Hogwarts barefoot.

- Does she fidget a lot, because she can't help but keep a rhythm? This could be detrimental in classes that require absolute concentration like Transfiguration or Potions.

*. How does she relate with her peers? Do they like the music or find it annoying? Or some would appreciate it, if it weren't for the more adversarial professors--I can't imagine Snape tolerating it, and thus taking many points from Ravenclaw.

- Is the girl a Muggle-born? Half-blood? Pure-blood?

Don't forget contradictions! The more the better!

- For instance, does she love music, but not particularly like singing?

- Or perhaps, she loves music, but disdains Celestina Warbeck--Molly Weasley's favorite singer.

- Or perhaps, if her music has magically offensive abilities, she's aghast, because she despises violence.

There's definitely something to build on.

  If you have to see something with your own two eyes to believe it's real, you're going to miss half of life's wonders. All her life, Luna has wanted one thing above all else: to be able to hear the rainbow. NO DH SPOILERS.
