I've read a few: Thirty-five Owls from letterblade.net was fantastic. I read most of linkaoc([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1651109/chapters/3501239]]) (Text Talk by merlywhirls) but it just lost its mojo by the end in my opinion.

My only real filter is no explicit sexting/explicit sex. I'd rather not read that.

Thanks in advance for your finds

#+begin_quote
  Credence has been living and travelling with Newt Scamander since he found his way to England after nearly being killed by MACUSA's aurors in the New York subway. While Newt works on a way to safely extract the obscurus from Credence, Credence works on channelling and harnessing his magic. One day, a letter arrives for him. It's strange enough, as nearly everyone believes him to be dead, but when he sees it's from Percival Graves, he finds his hands trembling as he opens the missive. Spurred by suspicion, curiosity and not a little loneliness, he writes back.

  What happens when a brain damaged Harry and a transgender Hermione both get sorted into Slytherin? Snape's not sure, but he thinks it's likely to be an interesting term. This story follows various first years through the trials of their first year.
