So I was watching a YouTube video when the guys in the video said that in Britain they call desserts pudding, and they were both British so I trust that what they said was true. But then I thought of Luna and her pudding. So my question is, when Luna says she wants pudding, did she mean pudding pudding or desserts? (btw I'm American and have never heard desserts being called pudding unless it was actual pudding)


** Pudding is an informal way to refer to the entire dessert course.

"What's for pudding?" To which the answer might be cake or ice cream or crumble or anything else.

There are also also specific puddings (sticky toffee, christmas, rice, figgy, bread and butter)

Luna's only line referring to pudding in the entire canon is

#+begin_quote
  â€˜No, I think I'll just go down and have some pudding and wait for it all to turn up
#+end_quote

Where she clearly means 'I'll just go down and have some dessert'. Luna's liking for American style custard puddings is entirely fanon.

** Yes and no- pudding is more broad a word over in the UK.

It can mean the dessert course, but it can also mean a custard- not a pudding as Americans think of it.

I'd say it's probably a custard Luna refers to since J/K Rowling specifies foods often enough- Trecale Tart, Pumpkin Pasties and so on.

*** I think you may have misread the source you provided. It's saying that what /Americans/ call "pudding" is a similar to custard. But British puddings are more like cakes, except they're probably more moist, especially if they've been boiled or steamed.

And I would say the opposite in answer to [[/u/Kage_K]]'s question - that Luna probably means Dessert, since she's not really being specific. Saying she wants a pudding would be the equivalent of wanting just "tart" or "pasty", rather than Treacle Tart or Pumpkin Pasty. If she was being specific she'd say, for example, that she wanted Sticky Toffee Pudding.

**** And just to confuse everyone further, what with the other pumpkin products in the series being sweet, [[https://www.bbc.com/food/recipes/classic_cornish_pasty_67037][pasties are usually savoury]].

***** Yeah, that bugs me. Also, to annoy people more, pasty is pronounced liked nasty, not paste-ee.

** Pudding can be either a dessert (sticky toffee pudding) or a savoury (steak and kidney pudding). It can be an accompaniment to a main meal (yorkshire pudding) or another term for a type of blood sausage (black pudding). It always depends on the context. With tea or at the end of a meal, it's likely a dessert.

** I'm British. No idea you lot had a specific meaning for pudding. Pudding is any kind of desert where I am.
