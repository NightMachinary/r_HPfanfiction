** Personally my favourite names were ones from Shakespeare, like Sebastian and Olivia or whatever- it adds backstory to why they named Hermione Hermione and you can make up cute little stories about how they met from it.

** Dan and emma were a codification. If you saw those names, it was a h/hr story. If it was rupert and emma, it was a [[/r/hr][r/hr]] story.

** I'm actually OK with Dan and Emma - why not?

But picking an 'official fandom' naming is an exercise is herding cats. It's just something else to argue about. We have plenty of that already.

** Why not? Because there are already enough fans having fits when authors don't follow heir own narrow-minded interpretation of canon characters.

**** And if there was an official fandom name", people would nope out of stories for not following that convention. People are petty like that.

** Personally, I don't really care what name the Grangers get, but petitioning a change won't change anything since it's fanfiction, there are no standards you must follow. If you don't like the names write your own story and use whatever names you want. Dan and Emma are only popular choices because virtually everyone uses them, and as someone already mentioned it used to be code for H/Hr since Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson played Harry and Hermione.

** How would switching out one set of boring generic names for another set of boring generic names fix anything?

Also: I never realized that people named Gary and Becky had specific stereotypes about them.

***** You do realise that "Christian Name" is simply another way of saying "first name", right? It isn't necessarily religious.

****** Actually, christian name is necessarily religious. It comes from 'the proselytizing of the savages' such as missionaries in Africa who would then give their victi---i mean converted, a christian name or the baptism of a child born to christians to wipe away his 'original sin.' The term you want is 'given name' versus a surname or family name.

******* The term "Christian Name" has been in use for far longer than the imperial age of forced conversion of Africans. In any case, it's an irrelevant argument because the modern definition of the "Christian Name" is interchangeable with that of given name or first name. It's old-fashioned, but it no longer implies religious connotation.
