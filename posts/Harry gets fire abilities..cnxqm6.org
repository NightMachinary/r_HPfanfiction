So, after escaping Voldemort during the graveyard battle, and being on the run for three months, he is found injured by Hermione Granger. There he is taken to a muggle hospital, where his right eye I believe becomes golden as he can then see magic. His pyro abilities comes from him taking the Phoenix feather in his arm when his wand broke. He also apprentices to Septima Vector I believe when he comes back to Hogwarts.
