For me, it's telling me why they don't like the premise I'm writing, then proceed to review and /complain/ about said premise as though I can change it. I just don't understand the thought behind it; if you don't like the idea, don't read it.

So, what are yours?


** I had a guy leave a review for every chapter while only writing one to three words each and ending every single one of them with his username. Happened a couple hours ago. Was pretty happy to have gotten twenty-five reviews for the latest chapter. Turns out nearly half of them were pointless and not even about the latest chapter.

On a different story, one person thought it would be useful to quote random mistakes (grammar, spelling) without providing context and make his reviews consist of mostly abbreviations and I couldn't figure out what he was talking about in half of the cases. He also pointed out several nonexistent plotholes because he kept misunderstanding things.

** Not read correctly. I get rather irritated at reviews that begin complaining about something that doesn't even happen, or does happen but they think it didn't. It's especially bad if it's a guest review, so I can't passive aggressively tell the person they've misread. I end up just deleting these ones if the only thing about is them being outright wrong. Like dude, fucking read correctly.

** I am the sort of writer that really likes meaningful feedback. The most irritating reviews to me are the ones that simply say, "Great start!" or "I love it!" or "OMG Harry Ginny so cute!" I've learned that when I have my husband read my chapters, I have to ask him specific questions to get him to give me feedback on specific areas. Unfortunately, you can't really do that in most online review systems. This is why I like AO3's kudos system as a way to leave a token of appreciation if you don't feel moved to write a review.

I understand that not everything I write is going to be everyone's cup of tea and that's fine. I've certainly run into things that I didn't like. If you have something negative to say, then say it and tell me why. Don't just say, "I hated this." Say, "I hated this because I do not agree with your premise that everyone in the wizarding world would have been better off if Harry had run off to be a lion tamer and gotten himself eaten." Fantastic, got it. You don't like lion-tamer Harry.

If you like my dialog, say so. If you like the way things are described or a certain scene or a particular turn of phrase, let me know. If you find something awkward or poorly worded or you feel a character was acting very out of character in a scene, let me know. I can't improve if I don't know what's wrong.

I'm not a fragile child that will come to pieces because you didn't like the picture I drew. Yes, you're going to get the busybody reviewer that will take you to task because you have them cursing too much or having too much sex or not enough sex or any of a multitude of other things that fans of such a cherished and popular property hold dear, but that's just noise. If you want to do me a solid, tell me what you liked or didn't like and be specific. And also answer questions when I reply to you. It's only polite.

** A few days back when there was a 'Readers what should Writer's do better' thread I almost flipped out and made a 'What Reviewers Need to do Better'

I would say that 80% of the reviews I receive are utterly useless and pointless. Most chapters I publish I look for specific names on the reviews because there are people who I know will provide insight that is useful to me. But the vast majority just don't. As a whole, that doesn't bother me. What bothers me is entitlement and expectation.

The thing that irritates me the most is when the reviewer clearly hasn't read the chapter or the story. These happen constantly. I recently received 8 reviews on the first 8 chapters of one of my fics from the same user in under 45 minutes. I know this user didn't read 80,000 words in 45 minutes. Four of them came in under 8 minutes. Could they have read it and gone back chapter by chapter and posted after the fact? Sure. But their review also says things like 'EIGHT CHAPTERS IN AND NO ONE HAS EVEN USED A WAND' well half of chapter six was devoted to learning one specific spell. Instead your review of six ignored that and whined about quidditch and posed a High School level discussion question to me that was both embarrassing to you and insulting.

This happens constantly with fanfiction. People don't read it that closely, and then miss things and whine about it later. I shouldn't have to tell you that Phoebe is Emily. It's given away multiple freaking times in the text. Rather than reviewing with things like 'Harry's internal monologue seems out of character, he's not that violent' maybe think about what you should know, from having read Harry Potter, what is actually IN HIS HEAD. Didja notice how the narration shifts to make that seem like he's having a conversation with someone? Who could he be talking with? Don't ask me questions in reviews to things that you just missed in the text. I'm more than happy to talk about such choices in the story. But then cite what you have a question about. Because chances are i already addressed it.

The entitlement from reviewers makes me crazy too. Nothing like having spent 40-50 hours (coincidently, I did the math and since I began fanfiction in 2010, based on chapter averages, I've devoted about ten percent of my life, including sleeping time..to writing fanfiction...so....that's pathetic.) writing a chapter and having the FIRST THING I SEE ABOUT IT be "UPDATE PLEASE!" Go die in a fire.

Reviews like that make me sit there and thing, "You know, you've really wasted a lot of time on a hobby that you're starting to not particularly care about. And every time you post something you get so excited to see what people think, and every time you get the same innane responses to the point that it actually depresses you. Maybe it's time to not do this anymore."

People go 'you need to have thick skin' and to an extent you do. But really, it's more that you need to have a super high tolerance level for bullshit.

And the third thing that irritates me is shippers. Fuck your ship. I am not writing a blank and blank story. It doesn't need a cutsey name. You didn't pick up A Game of Thrones to see if Eddard was going to bone Cersei. I'm trying to write STORIES here. With Plots. Characters, and the like. I'm not writing something so that Harry can fuck Daphne. I'm not saying my shit is nearly as good as anything published. But I'm trying to do a lot more than just force random characters into romantic relationships. And the comments I get ignore that.

Instead I have a scene where Harry comforts a Hermione who was sexually assaulted, holds her, cares for her, and acts exactly how a best friend should act. And I get reviews of 'Ugh why didn't you say it was Harmony. Abandoned'. I'm supposed to value that opinion? Harry is obviously attracted to a different person in this story. And obviously treating Hermione on the basis of other things that have happened to him and things he's seen. And really just trying to be a nice guy. It's possible to comfort a female and not be in love with her. And given how fond I am of foreshadowing and juxtaposition, it's possible for Hermione to return the favor coming up on a hugely important event in Harry's life. But the fact that I already know what's going to happen in the story often seems lost on most reviewers.

Honestly if it wasn't for Rpeh, RAFAN2421, Raven3182 and a few others. I'd have given up on this pursuit long ago.

Edit: Oh and Tonythepony left quite a few good ones recently too, so thanks for that.

**** Ish. It's not like I'm foaming at the mouth when I see 'Update please'. I usually roll my eyes and wonder what the person thinks that they're accomplishing.

Going out of your way to write a full sentence is a gigantic step above that. I'm still not really going to put much stock in it, but you at least took the time to formulate a nice thought about it.

Ideally, I'd prefer something like, "Hey I'm really enjoying this. I loved when X did X and thought that interaction was neat. I look forward to more." Most of the reviews i get I don't think people even bothered to read the story. Something that indicates the reviewer did read the story cheers me greatly. Something like that makes me far more motivated to write than 'update please'.

I've always joked that if you want me to write faster, get me excited about the story. I don't know if it's attention whorey, but if I didn't want to discuss my writing, I wouldn't post it on the internet and excitement is contagious.

I mean to try for some perspective. My original plan of Limpieza De Sangre is dated March 5th, 2015. I started planning the fic I'm currently working on almost THREE years ago. I started publishing it in January in 16, and focused on it in earnest around August of 16. I've been working in this story in some way or another for almost three years. I'm sick of it. Reading what other people enjoy about it helps revitalize my interest in it. I mean it was three years before I even wrote the one scene I wanted to with Umbridge. Writing takes a lot of time and effort. At least put some in to reviews so I don't feel like I'm wasting my time and effort.

And I'm literally asking for a sentence. Tell me what you liked or even what you disliked. I don't care. Just make me actually think someone is reading it!

*** I think you unknowingly point out a major weakness in Fanfiction. The chapter by chapter updates, as compared to the release of a completed novel/story. For instances, I did not pick on Phoebe being Emily, and having now gone back and read those chapters with that in mind I am now smacking my head against the wall (seriously I have read this story twice through I like it so much, and I did not pick up on that).

However, you are still correct, you as the author shouldn't have to say that Phoebe is Emily to your readers. That does not mean however it, and I am merely using this Phoebe/Emily scenario as an example, shouldn't become explicitly known in the story later.

This is often done, a mystery has small hints revealed at first, and as the story goes on the hints get progressively larger, until it is finally explicitly revealed. This literary device works really well in a completed story, because the time it takes to find out the mystery, or see the twist or...etc, is simply the time it takes to finish the book, as compared to Fanfiction which comes out chapter by chapter and can take years to be completed. I think this leads to people not grasping that the author is trying to tell and flesh out a full story, that will have things which won't be fully revealed until the end.

Anyways, I greatly enjoy your work, so I do hope you do not give up writing Fanfiction, and I look forward to seeing wherever you take us in the story.

**** Something authors can do mitigate this problem is finish the story (or at least a story arc) before you post the first chapter. Even if you still have editing to do or are running it through betas, that allows a reasonable and /predictable/ posting rate as well as being able to tell readers in the first chapter "hey, this is already done and has a crafted plot rather than making things up as I go".

I actually think the strengths and weaknesses of the episodic format are largely ignored in fanfiction, unfortunately.

*** I understand where you're coming from, my stories haven't gotten nearly as many reviews as yours, but I've received enough to understand the frustration that some reviews can cause. For instance, on my current story, I had a comment (I don't remember if it was a review or a PM or what) that warned me that Harry was turning into a Mary Sue. And this was in the third chapter while I was still in the middle of exposition and almost nothing major had happened yet. Utterly ridiculous.

However, I've found that like most things in life, if you put a positive spin on those idiotic reviews, it can lessen the rage/depression that they might cause. I say to myself, well, that's one more review in the tally, and if people sort the stories on FFN by review count, that's one review closer to more people reading my work and maybe commenting with something thoughtful.

PS, Thanks for the mention that you like my reviews, I'm honored. I've yet to get to your latest chapter - it's on my list of things to do when I actually have enough time to enjoy it - I'll be sure to try and leave a thoughtful review!

I'd like to think that I generally don't do these things, but I'm definitely guilty of asking for updates. Usually only after a long period of time with no update though (like there is a weekly update schedule and then there is no update for a month or 2).

**** Updates come when they are ready. That can be a week, that can be a month, that can be a year. Asking about it will not change that. I managed to do about 12-13 chapters of LdS on an update a week pace last year. That pace is nuts for me as it meant I spent three months doing pretty much nothing but fanfiction in my personal time.

You can ask. There's a 90% chance I'll ignore it. A 9% chance I'll respond with a trollish comment and a 1% chance I'll answer with an honest update.

I will say, and I can only speak for myself here, but I find questions about updates to be the most demoralizing thing I get from fanfiction. I would rather be flamed because I at least find humor in that. Asking about updates is a surefire way to get me to go do something else.

Part of this is probably because I'm pretty contrarian by nature. So when I get a review that goes 'OMG UPDATE SOON' it comes off to me like the person is telling me to do it, and I immediately just think 'nah'.

As I've said in other posts, the way to make me write faster is to make me excited about what I write. That means talking to me about the plot and the characters and what's going on. Not telling me I haven't updated in a while. Fun fact. I'm perfectly aware of how long it's been since I last updated. I don't get that message and think 'oh geez! It has been two weeks since I posted something. I better get on that!'

*** I can mostly empathize, but I personally don't get so hung about about so-called meaningless reviews (the ones that congratulate or ask if updates are coming (unless you just recently updated, lol)). Since there's no useful place to discuss a particular fic on say, FF, people will just use the reviews sections for general communication. And I don't mind it, as there are usually enough people who will point out any mistakes worth addressing for me (even if it's just a few).

On the one hand, I'm not that popular (this is the "cloud with silver lining" view) so I don't get badgered by scads of random lazy readers; on the other, I appreciate every comment I get, including "Wow!" and "Holy shit" and "Thanks for posting."

It probably has something to do with writing one-shots. Authors who have fans following their WiPs are more likely to get poked by impatient and possibly entitled nitwits, or by people who simply want to engage in some way. "Update soon!" is shorthand for "I'm eager to read more!" so it doesn't bother me. Irrelevant, shortsighted questions out of left field - well, I've never actually had to deal with those. My readers are pretty respectful, plus they generally have a handle on the kind of stuff I write. I've never even been on the receiving end of the classic "Why are you writing /slash,/ ew, ugh" bullshit that used to clutter up the premises.

So I'll have to go with a well-intentioned but obnoxious remark that I've been guilty of myself and for which I will someday spend time in a lesser circle of fanfic hell. There are few things more disappointing than a reader who gushes, "Oh, fantastic! I don't have time to leave a long comment now, /but I'll be back later to tell you all the things I love about this fic!/" Only to never be seen again. (Mea culpa, authors whose hopes I've dashed. I've sworn never to type those words again, no matter how tempting they are or how sure I am that I really will be back, bristling with superlatives and favorite quotes.)

** I often review differently depending on the state of a story. If it's complete - especially if it's been complete for a long time - I'll often leave a very brief comment. There doesn't seem to be much point offering detailed feedback on a story the author is long finished with. If there's something in particular that stands out - good or bad - I'll probably mention that, but that's about it.

On stories still in progress, though, I'll almost always try to offer some detailed thoughts. I was a bit reluctant at first, because it seemed presumptuous to tell someone writing a story for free what I personally thought of their work, but after I got some nice replies from authors I realised most of them appreciated the feedback. One author was less than friendly, so I simply haven't reviewed any of their stuff since.

With the positive responses, I've ended up being a beta for Starfox5 and presently for TheEndless7 and it's been an enjoyable experience.

I really wonder sometimes what motivates the more pointless reviewers. One that stood out on Limpieza de Sangre was simply "I don't like Hermione.", and was the subject of a couple of emails between myself and TE7. What on earth is that review supposed to achieve? Does it reference Hermione in general or the version of her in this story? Did the reviewer really think TE7 was going to go back and write her out? And at a more basic level, does he think anybody actually gives a flying toss?

For my own stories, I appreciate most comments even if it's just a couple of nice words. The only one that irked me (mildly) was one that pointed out a continuity error that I already knew about, while missing two others. But even that meant someone had read my stuff, and that's a nice feeling.

*** Ignore this asshole.

He is terrible and once sent me a review about how characters in my story wouldn't shower.

Also that review is driving me batty. Is it HERMIONE in general or MY HERMIONE. Does he have no empathy for the girl who was sexually assaulted?! Did I handle that poorly?! Was there something that I needed to change!? WOULD SHE HAVE A SHOWER?!

Inquiring minds want to know.

** Although I've written a fair bit, I haven't actually published any fiction online. I'm planning to in the near future, however. But from a reader's perspective, a lot of authors that I've seen have... hm. Pressured is the wrong word, but have certainly made a point of telling everybody that they want every reader to review. And a lot of people don't write themselves and aren't always able to give detailed constructive criticism.

People seem also to be increasingly short on time and if they're following several stories and have to spend time on every update themselves.. well, some would see it as a chore. Even as a writer, I'll sometimes completely mind-blank when it comes to feedback. No idea why, it's just something that happens. I think that's why some people end up leaving slightly inane or not-particularly-useful reviews. - They feel like they should say something but they don't really know what to say.

I have seen an awful lot of people who question decisions, research, pairings etc. and it irritates me even on other people's work. Especially when they reply and the reviewer turns it into an unnecesarry debate.

** Everything [[/u/TE7]] said, and just one more point I get from HP reviewers ALL the time, which is just so pointless it actually drives me doolally.

Constantly get readers who complain x canon thing did or did not happen, or constantly ask about characters who aren't important in the new AU. If it's an AU, read the actual fucking plot. Don't ask questions about Dolores Umbridge when she's never been mentioned. Don't guess that Dobby is the culprit when Dobby was killed in /second year./

It's so unbelievably insulting for someone to read DOZENS of chapters, hundreds of thousands of words, and try to seem profound by asking basic questions that would apply to the canon text and, very obviously, not the AU. Why bother reading the fic at all?

Ditto leaving reviews on an AU with a complex and developed plot and saying shit like, "But when will Harry become Lord Potter?" as if THAT shit was canon too. Like, this is why I prefer to post on Ao3 - I get fewer comments, but the median age is so much higher. I would genuinely ban under 16 year olds from commenting on any of my stuff if it were possible.

And another thing is the entitled reviewers who comment stuff like "I love this! Hope it doesn't turn out to be slash..." or stuff like that. I genuinely couldn't give a fuck what you hope the fic will or won't be. I especially don't care if you're going to phrase it like a catty wife in a sitcom, supposedly mumbling it under your breath as if I'm going to feel sympathy for you. If your review is just passive aggression aimed at the author, it's probably not worth reading.

I APPRECIATE that not every reviewer is comfortable leaving concrit or a complex comment, but when you get the same idiotic, one-sentence reviews, of COURSE it's going to grate on you. I don't think it's entitlement so much as wishing the amount of effort you put in as a writer would be reflected in the response of the readers.

This is big. I'm providing free entertainment that often takes me about 40-50 man hours a chapter of planning, writing, and editing and more often than not you can't even get a 'thank you' instead it's just 'you need to update more!' or 'nice!'. Calling me entitled because these reviews annoy me is laughable. I guarantee anyone who says that that if I were really 'entitled' I wouldn't have published a million words of free writing content on the internet.

The fact that readers hold writers to a much higher standard than they would ever hold themselves is part of the problem.

** I can think of many but I'll give my top 3 that come to mind. 1) Reviewer commenting and correcting purposely made grammar errors (made purposely while Harry is a kid and talks like that) and their own review has misspellings and grammar errors. 2) I don't mind vague "I love this" "this is awesome" etc, but when I get the rare "This is the best story I ever read" I'm like really? I know of a lot better and I think they just want me to continue on with faster posting. (It kind of makes you feel good seeing the review but then you second guess if they're telling the truth when they don't give any reasons). 3) The best is getting a review on chapter 5 on how they don't like the story and then reviewing again on chapter 6 and 7. Why are you still reading if you don't like it!!!? But I guess it's still good that people take the time to say something rather than Like, Kudos or whatever else.

** I'm generally happy with almost any reviews I receive, however there are two types that get on my nerves. First, reviews that make no sense. Reviews that merely say "Good story" or the like aren't the best, but I understand the sentiment contained therein. But it's things like a recent review I received saying, "bacon is the cheapest vegetable" when I haven't written anything about bacon or vegetables or things that are cheap that really have me scratching my head. I really enjoy responding to my readers, but how do you respond to that? What does that even mean? I've spent a significant portion of my free time writing this and offering it up for free, and when someone actually takes the time to review, that's what they've got to say?

Second, reviewers who bring their fandom impressions and biases to your stories and argue about them, even if the point they're referring to is absent. I see this a lot with Ron's character especially. Sure, Ron has plenty of flaws, but I think canon portrays him as a generally good kid with his heart in the right place, even if his emotions and temper get the best of him sometimes; he's not the monster that a lot of people make him out to be. I had one person tell me they were abandoning the story because I dared to have Ron be friends with Harry and Hermione, and another argue with me that Ron was never friends with Hermione to begin with. It just makes me shake my head in wonder and confusion.

**** The fact that so many people seem to filter for stories by the amount of reviews shows that sadly, that is the way the system works. I don't believe it's right and it's clearly no indication of quality but that's a different issue.
