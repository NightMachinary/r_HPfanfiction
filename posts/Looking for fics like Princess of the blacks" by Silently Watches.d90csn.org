** I've read it as well, and sorry bro but that fic was lightning in a bottle, you're not likely to find something like it again.

That said, there is another series that I think you might enjoy. It has an entirely different tone, and it's based more around supernatural power than wielding the darker aspects of magic, but I think you'll like it.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade][The Denarian Series by Shezza]]

It is a crossover with the Dresden Files series, but you don't need to know anything about them in order to enjoy the fic. (I didn't even realize it was a crossover until halfway through, it did such a good job organically integrating the new material). It is very different from the Black Queen Series to be sure, but it is quite enjoyable.

PS: For those who haven't read them, here are links to the Black Queen Series by Silently Watches.

PPS: The Black Queen Series is dark AF, not for the faint of heart.

  Hermione Granger knows she's not a good person. Disillusioned with life at only twelve years old; she is cynical, manipulative, ruthless and, above all else, a survivor. For six years she has lived on the streets of London with only her sharp mind and her sharper knives to keep her alive, but a letter from an owl changes everything for Hermione, and the bond she forms on the Hogwarts Express with a timid boy with broken glasses, skinny wrists and a lightning-shaped scar will change the whole of Wizarding Britain.  Main Pairing: Harry Potter/Hermione Granger/Tom Riddle

** linkffn(13001792)

"Princess of the Blacks" if it was not an edgelord's wet dream. A powerful MC who cares little about social norms or laws, a good approach to dark magic which isn't as edgy as Black Luminary or PotB and 33/35 chapters have good pacing (two are a slug).

Tagged as H/Hr, but as of today, there is not even a hint of that pairing.
