The last two weeks had a deluge of posts clearly aimed to generate controversy, and not the positive kind. If the OP is about Weasley bashing, people turn the comments into a Hermione bashfest and the other way around.

Can't we simply go back to a civilised discussion about specific fics instead of starting the Great Bashing War of 2018?

** Has any fanfic ever featured literally Hitler at hogwarts?

Example: somehow Grindelwald transferred Hitler into Eva Braun as an unborn child. She gave birth in prison and he turned out to be born as a wizard. His birth is covered up because the authorities don't want a kid to grow up being known as the child of Hitler.

*** It wouldn't be done correctly because most people believe Hitler to be a madman that was a psychopath that killed his followers or soldiers on a whim. Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus is the perfect example of that. Hitler was considered to be very charismatic, charming, and polite when in company. He was an astonishing politician. He was just a terrible general.

Anyway, before people calling me a Nazi supporter, I would have taken this idea into heed if I could write or speak German.

**** I think that the difficult part would be writing the entire thing in English without losing the charisma. Give me some time and I can write a speech with the same speech patterns and rhetorics in German, but turning the entire thing into good sounding English is next to impossible since the German language favours more complex sentences and you can combine words together, giving them a different "sound".

***** I don't see a point in changing his language from German to English. I think you're right. He would lose everything if he spoke English. Maybe I'm biased because I love the German language and think a lot of what he said loses impact when translated to English because it lacks the emotion that German provides.

******* I did not word that correctly... I was tired.

The issue I was trying to get to is changing Hitler's language from German to English seems odd. I mean, you could have him learn English, but if he suddenly showed up speaking fluent English, it'd probably pull /me/ away from the story.

It's done way too often. Why do foreign people speak English to their friends? lol.

*** The best one I remember is either Hogwarts being attacked by some weird Grindelwald/Dumbledore hybrid with an enchanted WWII German battleship and another where Voldemort made a pebble into a Horcrux and accidentally dropped that on the wreck of the Bismarck, reviving ot with magic. Neither was particularly good and I don't even remember the names of them.

Honestly not much has really changed, people recommend the same 10ish stories for everything, almost everything has been talked about. Every couple of months something pops up that inspires a brief discussion of something new.

What you are complaining about has frustratingly been common too. When people are bored they want to be negative.
