I'm looking for this scene or something similar as it the only thing that I can remember about the fic Harry has been staying at the Grangers and introduces them to sirus when he is declared innocent.. any help would be appreciated thanks in advance


** I did a simple search for Dan Emma Troll (within 20 words) figuring that would come up in adventure confessions and came up with 4 stories.

** Can you think of any other scene that stands out? Special non-canon wand cores, using a pensieve at the grangers (though that is somewhat common as well), Harry and or Hermione animagus forms etc.

For instance, i download all the stories I read. A simple search on the words Dan and Emma within 5 words of each other returns over 200 stories. So the more unique the scene (like Harry Thestral animagus) the easier it is to find the requested fic (if I've read it).

** Way too many fics have a scene like that. By any chance were the Grangers called Dan and Emma?

Any more details?

**** Eh, not really. That's generic as fuck in the HHr fics.

Try looking through Robst's fics. He writes stuff that sounds similar to that.

****** That also happens a lot. HHr fics are /very/ formulaic.

Robst is your best choice.
