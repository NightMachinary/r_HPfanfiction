I remember seeing this in a fanfic. What if the Taboo was originally made by Voldemort, and the Ministry only acquired it after his temporary defeat on Halloween 1981?

I think it's a fairly plausible explanation as to why so many people were afraid to say his name, and why the Ministry never seemed to use the Taboo for anything else in canon.


** The taboo is very much like the trace, which exists in everything but name before DH. If Voldemort was only able to implement the taboo after taking the Ministry it's a short jump to Voldemort modified the trace; Voldemort used Ministry spells/devices to place a taboo on his name.

In the 70s, Voldemort worked in the Dark. No one knew who he was or who was working for him. In canon, Death Eaters called him 'Lord' and Dumbledore called him Voldemort. People who were scared and/or didn't want to out themselves needed to call him something.

True, they are both horrible plotcrutches mending holes in JKR's story.

**** Yes, but I think the Taboo working like I described works well for the story. Death Eaters don't say his name, they call him the Dark Lord. The only ones who do are those that dare fight him.

It would also explain why people were afraid to say his name for so long, because by the end of the war, the Taboo was common knowledge, and even after Voldemort got disembodied in 1981, he had vanished, no one ever found the body, so they weren't sure if he was truly gone.

It also gives an adequate reason they never used it for anything else. I'd imagine if the Ministry was responsible for it, we'd have heard about it more often, or even just other usages when it was first mentioned.

***** Agree, the Taboo is a bit better developed than the Trace. Still, I would be very wary of getting too close to it, because you get into horrible contradictions. See for example chapter 15 “He Who Must Not Be Named” of linkffn(Wait, What? by Publicola).

****** That's where I got the idea. I should have cited it in my initial post, but I couldn't remember where I read it.

** The Taboo is purely a Voldemort thing, we never see it being used anywhere else. This is supposed to explain why people are terrified of saying his name, but then no one ever brings it up until Deathly Hallows after the trio get captured, so it doesn't seem like something JKR actually put a lot of thought into.
