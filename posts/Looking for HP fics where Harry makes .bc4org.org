I don't care how he does it, just want to see my boy get rich.


** I think *The Price is Right* [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9894129/1/The-Price-is-Right]] might be up your ally.

Maybe *Moratorium* [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9486886/1/Moratorium]] But that one isn't as much directly about money as some others, and is really just a lot weirder.

I know I have read others, but apparently they aren't in my favorites.

​

EDIT: I am pretty sure *Call Me Moriarty* [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11602420/1/Call-Me-Moriarty]] is a good candidate.

  A young boy in a dark cupboard is in great pain. An unusual power will allow him to heal himself, help others, and grow strong in a world of magic. Eventual God-like Harry, Unsure of eventual pairings. Alternate Universe, possible universe/dimension traveling in the future.

** Newsflash: he already is bloody rich (and that's even in cannon, not only nonsensical phanon goblins-induced fortune). Which is one of the things which make me angry: how (with Weasleys' exception) all of them are upper-middle class or richer. Yes, there are somewhere in background Creeves', but most everybody is so Mary Sue's rich, that it is disgusting.

*** I think you misunderstood my request. I was asking for fics where he makes money. I don't care about the having money part i am interested in the making part. I read a cool fic where Harry Luna and Hermione become thieves and make mad money. I was interested in other ways people had him make money.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny
