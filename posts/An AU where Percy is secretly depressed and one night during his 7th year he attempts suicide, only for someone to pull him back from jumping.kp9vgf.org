It was Oliver Wood

Despite being roommates, they hadn't spoken many words over the course of their education. They had, essentially, lived separate lives. He was the last person that Percy would expect to see. Now, with red puffy eyes, trembling, Percy stared at Oliver for the longest time. Torn between shame and overwhelming curiosity as to why he'd done what he did.

That night, while they both laid in bed unbeknownst to the other that they were not sleeping, just staring up at the ceiling, Oliver felt guilty. Guilty for not getting to know Percy. Guilty for treating him like he wasn't even there or worth the time of day. Guilty for not recognizing the signs.

He decided right then and there that he would get to know Percy Weasley

Over the course of their 7th year, the two boys develop a deep friendship and Oliver helps him patch up things with his family

Over the course of that year, Percy feels a sense of belonging, he feels love and acceptance for who he really is

*I'm in the process of writing this but I still wanted to share the idea.

*There aren't enough Percy and Oliver friendship fics so I decided to write one


** I'd 100% read this, I read to much focusing on Harry and friends would love some different characters.

*** I'm not sure this is quite true. Wizards seem more hardy in terms of falls from Quidditch but staff still are quick to cast cushioning charms. Neville bouncing was an incident of accidental magic coming from strong emotions which is harder to come by in trained wizards. (Or else you'd see more of it in duels.)

If Percy felt numb or relieved, it's quite possible accidental magic wouldn't kick in. Of course, it depends on how strong his lizard brain impulse to live is.

** It was **Sybill Trelawney**

...

Over the course of **his** seventh year, [Percy learned how to utilize his now open inner eye. For it was only under the depressed circumstances of a wizard or witch almost killing themselves could they actually touch on the edges of true future sight. (It was such a rare occurance for a wizard or witch to actually almost kill themselves; their magic usually kept them safe from such a little thing as jumping off a tower.) ]

** It was McGonagall, who was patrolling the area

There was a noise above her. Swiftly she looked up, wand already pointing at the source. She relaxed as she recognized the red hair above a pale face.

‚ÄòWeasley? What are you doing there?'

Then he jumped (whichever it was) and time stopped.

One part of her was, although she'd never admit to it later, gibbering in terror. Most of her, though, worked through the most effective spells and memories, and automatically she used Dumbledore's spell from when Harry fell off his broom. Percy's descent slowed. But it wouldn't be enough... she shouted a /Locomotor/ spell and moved her wand upwards a bit, then slooowly downwards. It did the trick.

When Percy landed, he looked /furious/.

‚ÄòWhy didn't you just let me?' he demanded. McGonagall closed her eyes. ‚ÄòI couldn't,' she said simply, and then, stern again: ‚Äòcome with me.' Percy looked about to protest. ‚Äò/Now./'

He didn't protest.

In her office, she made him a cup of tea and shot off a Patronus to Pomfrey and Dumbledore.

Then, she wasn't sure what to do. Dumbledore was Merlin-knows-where, probably arranging another patrol in her area, so he wouldn't be on hand for this.

‚ÄòChocolate biscuit?'

She winced. It sounded more like a order then a offer.

Percy gulped. ‚ÄòUh, yes, thank you?'

She gave him the tin and began to dig through her drawers in search of Scotch and the good chocolate from Hogsmeade - ever since all those Dementors came she had made a habit to always have some in her office - which she gave him, too. Percy ate as if it was some solemn duty that he had just gotten the honor of full filling.

‚ÄòWhy'd you...,' she trailed off, not sure how to word it.

He sniffled. She gave him a new cup of tea.

‚ÄòIt's just...,' he began. ‚ÄòIt's just IamabouttofaileverythingSiriusBlackwantstokillmybrothersbestfriendandwouldkillhimtooIcanthelpthemwhycantIhelpthemIshouldbeabletoIamaGryffindor -‚Äò

McGonagall was unable to discern much more than ‚ÄòSirius Black' and ‚ÄòGryffindor'.

‚ÄòCan you slow down a bit?'

Percy took several deep breaths. ‚ÄòSirius Black is trying to kill my youngest brother's best friend and probably him, too, and I can't help them but I /should/, I am a Gryffindor, I am their older /brother/, I am responsible for not just /them/ but the entire year... and I am failing all my classes, I am /sure/ of it!'

McGonagall sighted. ‚ÄòYou're /not/ responsible for Harry Potter's safety - /or/ your brother's, for that matter,' she started.

**** The prompt an sich (the title) didn't mention anything specific. The thing under that is merely how OP planned to write it. In the prompt, Percy is secretly depressed, attempts suicide, gets saved. That's it. In my interpretation, it wasn't really about grades, perhaps not even about Sirius or his brother; he is depressed, feels like a failure of a brother or human being or Gryffindor, and that feeling latches onto any reason, however rational or irrational.

** Sorry I'm so late, I saw this and got an idea for crack.

With a sad sigh Percy pushed open the common room window to its full length and gazed out at the moon.

Just the sight of the glowing sphere bought regret crawling up his throat.

Despite his best attempts at being a good brother, non of the others respected him, his attempts to thrive academically were looked down on and he had nothing on some of the others boys in the looks department.

He was a waste of space.

The only people who loved him were his parents and that seemed like it only came up when Percy actually came into view, the rest of the time he was more then likely swept away into the recesses of their mind while they focused on the other children.

Taking a breath he leant over and stared at the long drop down. It was as ever-long.

Long enough that to jump from his current height would kill him instantly.

Straightening up he took a deep breath.

This was it. No point hanging around-

Before he could even finish the thought he felt someone rip him away from the frame, sending him stumbling to the cold floor.

With a startled gasp he whirled around to see Oliver Wood, the captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, leaning over to shut-

-wait.

‚ÄúO-Oliver?‚Äù Percy stuttered as the man climbed up on to the small sill and pushed himself as close to the edge as he could without falling. Upon hearing Percy he whirled round, a vicious look in his eyes.

‚ÄúThat fucker Flint!‚Äù He spat.

For a precious second Percy just stared glassy eyed at him before darting to his feet and holding up his hands in surrender.

‚ÄúOliver stop-please I-‚Äù

‚ÄúHe said he's gonna off himself tonight but /I'm/ gonna do it /first!/-/there he is!/-see ya Percy!‚Äù

And with that Oliver Wood threw himself out of the window.

With a cry Percy ran over and looked down, only to immediately regret it upon seeing Oliver explode on the ground into a puddle of red.

Before Percy could do anything, another cry of fury echoed from another tower, looking up Percy just had time to catch a glint of a falling figure and hear the familiar voice of Marcus Flint give a cry of /'Fuck you Wood!'/ Before he too tuned into a red puddle on the floor with an echoing crack.

Percy could do nothing but stare in horror.

Had-had Oliver turned Flint's suicide into a competition?

Had the overly competitive Scot actually made a game out of mental illness?

Swallowing hard Percy wanted nothing more then to pull back and scream hysterically, however another voice made itself known, swallowing his attention.

‚ÄúHoly shit! Was that Oliver?‚Äù

Though he couldn't see him, the shrieking voice of the Ravenclaw captain-Roger Davies was unmistakable.

Percy tried to speak but nothing came out.

‚ÄúHoly Rowena it was!‚Äù Davies filled in, voice as hysterical as Percy felt. ‚ÄúFinally!‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat?!‚Äù Percy accidentally cried out, trying to crane his neck up through the window despite fearing it and its drop seconds ago.

‚ÄúQuidditch cup here I come!‚Äù Davies continued almost happily now. Percy just mouthed wordlessly upwards, unbelieving of the Ravenclaws sheer gall. Despite feeling seconds from fainting, another voice, this one from far below and sounding distinctly like the usually cheerful voice of the Hufflepuff captain, Cedric Diggory, made itself known as an angry snarl.

/‚ÄùDavies you ignorant slut!/
