** If you're new to Marauder Era, the "classics" are probably:

Linkffn(against the moon by stoplight delight) for years 1-3

Linkffn(the life and times by Jewel5) for years 6/7

Unfortunately both are incomplete but long enough to keep you immersed and fully develop each Marauder and their classmates.

  The odds were stacked against him: a child from a blended home with no friends, no social skills to speak of, and a terrible secret. Yet slowly Remus Lupin began to discover there was a place for him in the world, if he could find the courage to claim it.

** Hi there, here are some recommendations for Marauders fics. Mostly FanFiction but I do have one AO3. A lot of these I read a LONGGG time ago and favorited then, so I can't really say much except "I read them and thought they were good".

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15795258/chapters/36757752][Wish You Were Here]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/angelgang1/pseuds/angelgang1][angelgang1]] is a James Potter/OC fic. Very similar feel to your basic canon Lily/James. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15795258/chapters/36757752]])

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7286177/1/Summer-Magic][Summer Magic]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2625306/movinggirl][movinggirl]] is a James/Lily fic. There's gonna be a lot of these, lol, they were my 'bread and butter' for a long time. linkffn(7286177)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5344250/1/Time-Between-Us][Time Between Us]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/245085/C-Queen][C.Queen]] is a time travel fic where James Sirius Potter goes back to the Marauder era for a short time. It's James Sirius Potter/Sirius Black. linkffn(5344250)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7012597/1/You-Don-t-Say][You Don't Say]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1723915/UndercoverFabala][UndercoverFabala]] is another James/Lily fic. linkffn(7012597)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5048579/1/She-Said-What][She Said What?]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1283122/Zayz][Zayz]] is a James/Lily fic. linkffn(5048579)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2795240/1/Lily-s-List][Lily's List]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/906210/MotherCrumpet][MotherCrumpet]] is a James/Lily fic. linkffn(2795240)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3555029/1/10-Things-I-Hate-About-James-Potter][10 Things I Hate About James Potter]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/910798/AlannaDragon][AlannaDragon]] big shock- James/Lily fic. linkffn(3555029)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2717445/1/Tears-on-the-Balcony][Tears on the Balcony]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/71431/ByeByeBirdie][ByeByeBirdie]] this is another James/Lily fic and I remember particularly liking this one and it's sequel. linkffn(2717445)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/928550/1/Love-Life-and-Sugar-Highs][Love, Life and Sugar Highs!]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/191158/buckbeakbabie][buckbeakbabie]] if I remember correctly this James/Lily fic had an awesome Sirius in it. linkffn(928550)

â€‹

I have read loads of these and only fairly recently (last few years) started keeping track so I hope I haven't missed anything major. These should be plenty to get you started- all complete and long.

  You mean to say that Potter's family is coincidentally staying across the street from our beach house for the summer, Mum and Mrs. Potter are now randomly best friends, and they expect me to hang out with that git for two months? You've got to be joking. (Even worse? There's a sequel.)

  Lily genuinely liked James Potter. He was handsome enough to make any girl swoon, but he was also funny, clever, and secretly kind. Unfortunately, he could also be rude, thoughtless, spoiled, and cruel. Finding the balance was the tricky part. Author note: James is a jerk. Please don't be surprised.

  It's 1975 and Whoever-He-Is has turned his eyes towards Hogwarts. Muggle-born Lily Evans is certain her best friend has been recruited by the Death Eaters. She's less certain about her future in Wizarding Britain. And she has absolutely no idea how to handle the dark-haired, outrageously privileged, obnoxiously talented toerag named James Potter. A canon-compliant account of the first Wizarding War and the teenagers who fought in it.

** Definitely read The Marauders on Wattpad by Pengiwen. It covers their entire seven years at Hogwarts, sticks insanely close to canon yet adds its own unique characters and plotlines, tons of fun foreshadowing and references, and has the charm of an actual Harry Potter book. I'd say the only downside is you absolutely fall in love with these characters, even though you know their lives after Hogwarts is miserable. Here's the link to year one to get you started: [[https://my.w.tt/kQUn6ztXv3]]

** Check out the Divine Comedian on AO3. For example linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14760663/chapters/34132413]])

For a long fic I'd recommend linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16417496/chapters/38435513]])

  "We don't drown. We float. That's how Muggles used to tell, isn't it?"-When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost.It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything.(A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)[Edit: SPOILERS in the comments.]

  James is having the time of his life, Bellatrix enjoys a spot of nail-pulling, Marlene is an excellent dancer, Dorcas gets the job done, Remus finds a purpose in life that doesn't revolve around his werewolf alter ego, Sirius should perhaps try out a healthier lifestyle, Lily brews the best Polyjuice Potion, Alastor keeps an eye on things, Mary is scared for a reason, Gideon would probably be scared without one, Regulus can't wait to do the right thing once he figures out just exactly what that is and Peter had a great time in school. The question is, where is Voldemort's soul and is it safe to go looking for it?This is a self-indulgent take on the first wizarding war with canon divergence from chapter 25. The story is told from several points of view in a would-be attempt to scrape the surface on each character's psychology. There are mature themes throughout the story, but most chapters are supposed to be more humour than angst.
