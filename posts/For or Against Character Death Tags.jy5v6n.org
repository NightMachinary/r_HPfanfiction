I saw something similar a few days ago, and I'm just curious on the general consensus amongst the fandom. Some are for them, since they'd rather not read about their favourites dying or hurting, but some are against them since they kind of spoil things. What do you think? Are you for or against tagging character death? I'm also curious because I'd like to get into fic writing and if I ever take that route, I want to be as reader-friendly as possible when it comes to tags.


** I'll tag 'character death' but I don't spoil who (unless it happens before the story starts and the 'who' is central to the plot from the beginning, for example, their husband/wife in mourning)

** I don't care one way or the other. Unless it is clear from the summary which character is dead or going to die. If it is, then it must be tagged so that people could filter easier.

I'm much more concerned with the summary and excessive tagging or deliberately under/incorrect tagging.

First one is rampant on AO3, every single character gets tagged even when they only have single line of text, sometimes not even that.

Second one could be seen in FFN, stories with just one or no characters tagged even when it is clear there is at least one other character who has a significant part in the story, romance stories that doesn't tag the pairings as pairings but as regular individual characters.

** For, especially on AO3 where one has a way to sidestep the tag by clicking on the "Creator Chose Not To Use Archive Warning" field.

** Apart from Hedwig (because people who kill Hedwig are the true monsters :D), I'd say no to specific character death tags unless it's a big enough part of the story that it'd be cited in story recommendations here ("Oh yeah, it's all about Harry's wife /Insert Name Here/ dying in /Insert Character Appropriate Death Event Here/ and how he deals with the aftermath as a single dad").

Otherwise, I'd agree to having general ones, yeah, but only as either 'main/significant character death(s)' or 'secondary character death(s)'. There's still more than enough of both types of characters that we'd have pretty much no idea who the specific character that died is, so we're not wholly spoiled, but it gives enough of a guideline that people who are bothered by one of the main lot dying (ie. Hermione, Ron, Harry, Neville, Minnie McG, Dumbledore, Voldemort, etc) can skip the fic.

** Depends on why it is tagged. For example if it's tagged Dumbledore is already dead then I'm ok with it but if it's tagged Cho Chang will die then I don't like it.

** Against. It ruins the surprise.

** I would say it all depends on who is going to die. If Harry is destined to die, then yes, I would like to see it tagged so I don't waste my time reading the story, then having it ruined for me. Otherwise, you can mention character death in the description, without specifying who.

** Major character death works just fine, without really spoiling anything.

** I like as many helpful and specific tags as possible. I like and dislike very specific things.

I think major character death is a good tag. Death happens a lot in the books so it's not shocking it happens in fanfic and doesn't ruin the surprise cause u don't know who. I might still read.

But generally no I do not want to read a romance where the other person dies at the end. I just don't. And I would like that to be tagged very clearly. Like if it is a Sirius/Remus or Sirius/OC I want to know if he is going to die because I don't want to read that.

Also like let's say there is a weasley twin centric fic that's gonna through the the battle at hogwarts I want know what the outcome will be because I don't want to relive George losing Fred again and again
