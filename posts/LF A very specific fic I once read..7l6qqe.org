The basics of it were that Hermione Granger was a decorated war veteran who left the magical world after the war.

She only comes back to the magical world 80 some years later when the minister of magic dies, due to her being in exile.

She returns and is put on trial as part of a war crimes tribunal; and divulges that she only returned because the people involved in the incident she's being charged for are now all dead.

I distinctly remember that in the story she was part of a battle referred to as "The battle of the line".

If anyone knows what story this is, please link it as I appear to have lost it from my favorites somehow. Thanks!


** You have portions jumbled up. The fic is Seven Names linkao3(5265569) and I highly recommend reading it. Don't read past this for spoilers as I give corrections to OP

She is in exile because she refused to name names of people that were involved in a certain incident. She wasn't on trial for crimes she committed, just as a coinciding witness to events during the war and this trial was before she left. The Minister of Magic is still alive, it was the death of a quidditch player that sparked her return

**** You're welcome. I try to link it whenever it's relevant as despite how good it is I don't think it has near the popularity of other fics, though being in ao3 instead if fanfiction.net probably doesn't help.
