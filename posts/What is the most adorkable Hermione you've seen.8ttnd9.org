  After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness. But despite having gained great power in exchange for a bargain with the hidden Fae, she is still unable to kill the immortal Dark Lord. As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.

** Other than those mentioned, probably the christmas scene in linkffn(12136123)

#+begin_quote
  ~o~

  On Christmas morning, Harry woke to a pounding on his bedroom door. His first disoriented thought was that it must be his birthday if Hagrid had come to knock down the door again.

  "Harry, wake up!"

  "Uh?" he said, fumbling for his glasses.

  "It's Christmas!" shouted Hermione.

  "Hermione, let the poor boy sleep," he heard a tired voice say.

  "It's okay, Mrs. Granger, I'm up," he called.

  That was all the invitation Hermione needed. She threw the door open and burst into his room.

  "Hermione!" cried Mrs. Granger.

  "I'll get her," yawned Mr. Granger as he stepped into the room. Like Hermione, he was wearing his flannel pajamas. "Sorry about this one, Harry," he said, scooping an indignant Hermione off the floor and carrying her back into the hallway.

  "Daddy, put me down!" she yelled, trying to wriggle out of her father's arms. Harry could still hear Hermione grumbling as Mr. Granger carried her all the way downstairs.

  On board the Hogwarts Express, eleven-year-old Harry Potter receives a tantalizing glimpse into his own future. But where did this foreknowledge come from? And more importantly, how can he make it come true? A fairly fluffy first-year fic. Harry/Hermione. Mentor!Trelawney. Manipulative!Dumbledore.
