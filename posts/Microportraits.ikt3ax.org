Apparently when there's two portraits of the same person, they can be linked in a way that allows them to communicate. Possibly through various magical barriers. So, here's an idea on how to take over the world: All that's required is for a few painters to be part of your conspiracy.

It's simple. In each painting you make, you add an additional portrait of a trustworthy person on your side. That portrait would be tiny in the background, and since it's magical the depicted person could move around and hide. Since all the paintings have a hidden microportrait of the same person, they can all communicate with your portrait of that person and in turn with you.

Since they could also move between paintings, you now have spies that can access every painting in every household that has at least one of your paintings. After a while you should be able to find blackmail material on most of the wealthy families and control a significant share of the government.


** I actually recall a fic that used a similar concept. Granted though, I'm not sure this idea or the idea in that fic would work in canon-compliant magic system because the microportraits would be noticed by the larger portrait in the same frame. In addition, given how portraits move freely about in canon, I'm sure the idea of espionage through them is not novel and that there are countermeasures. I have my doubts about the efficacy of blackmail, but that's for a separate discussion.

Really, I think the future of espionage in the Wizarding world is an adaptation of the trace or taboo. A national level surveillance system that requires no entities to be present on the side of the surveilled is powerful enough already. A national level surveillance system that can pick up more than just jinxed words and magic usage would be even more so.

*** Taboo seems to require a ton of effort to set up for just one word. Maybe if you could set up a taboo on each dictionary word and feed that insane amount of detections into a central system you could maybe listen in on everything that everyone's saying, but it'd require an insane amount of data processing to sort out the important stuff from the junk. I don't think that the magical world knows much information science or has the capability for processing multiple gigabytes per second of raw text. Microportraits on the other hand have pretty advanced AIs in each location, capable of figuring out which information is relevant and what isn't.

**** Instead of adapting the current system to new purposes, I was thinking more along canon themes. For example, the spell might be adapted to pick up taboo topics and conversations. It's an adaptation to the spell but the underlying concept of taboo remains the same. The spell might also have to be adapted to record said conversations, now that it's not a specific word being defined. To put on taboo on every word clashes with the theme of canon, in my opinion.

I'd note that information processing might not be terribly difficult. Wizards have the equivalent of AIs, quills can answer exam questions for you, and even a spell like the summoning charm can handle some information processing.

***** Enchanted quills and things like that can do processing in good quality, but terrible quantity. A quill can write maybe 10 bytes/second of data, a piece of parchment stores a few kilobytes. Meanwhile if you want to run nationwide surveillance even if the taboo can do some filtering it'd still require way higher quantities, many orders of magnitude beyond what an entire warehouse full of parchment can do.

****** What I'm trying to convey is that it likely would not be terribly difficult to create or modify a spell to do said information processing, as opposed to taking current spells and adapting them in new ways. It would not be the taboo, for example, but a modification and offshoot of it.

The concept of useable blackmail material isn't a particularly complicated one and given how spells in Harry Potter clearly have the capacity to do information processing, it should be easy enough to create a spell to sort information. As always, I don't think muggle analogues are ever valid in a discussion on magic, especially the magic in Harry Potter which has its own separate system of laws governing it. I'm sure a future actual analogue to an entire network of fully sentient connected AIs would take significant processing power.

I'm not sure such a spell would even be needed. As I tried to convey earlier, an adaption of the taboo spell for blackmail purposes would probably be adapted to pick up taboo conversations. I see little reason why the spell couldn't be refined further to pick up useable blackmail only.

If this proves impossible and one's desperate, one could probably just go "accio useable blackmail results" in said warehouse.
