I realized I can't really think of any fics where Harry straight up hates Voldemort for killing his parents. It's always more of hatred of the ideology and a fight against evil. I guess I'm really looking for a fic where Harry wants to fight Voldemort more for revenge than to just survive or stop him.


** It's perhaps not exactly what you are looking for but in these two, rather humorous, fics Harry seeks revenge against Voldemort.

  The solution to all pest problems. Disillusioned with the effectiveness of the Ministry, Harry turns to the age-old muggle method to solve problems. Oneshot. Contains coarse language.

** Not to be off-topic as I don't have any fics to add but Harry definitely hatessss Voldemort in canon.

You are correct that there are people he hates more for a time - Bellatrix and Pettigrew

** linkffn(Eclipse of the Sky) as a mild spoiler, He hates Voldy so much that he goes back in time to kill him(the body, he still had horcruxes up) just so he could have the chance to save his girlfriend.

  Blood...it flowed through us all, until Voldemort began to twist it, taint it, harnessing it for his own purpose. The power of the species of the magical world--werewolves, vampires, metamorphmagi-was his for the taking. Harry would know, he'd taken his girlfriend's, & that would be his last mistake.

**** Its actually my second favourite fic all time, only Grow Young with Me beats it. Starts fairly slowpaced, and I actually dropped 100k words in because I started reading another fic at the time that simply grabbed me way harder. Then I forgot about this fic and one day I had a power outage for like 10hrs in my house, so to pass time, I browsed my phone for older fics to read and this popped up. Then i read it non stop for 2 days (at the time it was 700k words total) and started following it. Its really, really fucking amazing. Great battle scenes, great complex magics, the Horcruxes aren't boring, the OC is a new creature (it says so in the first or second chapter) and the world building is phenomenal, with a war SOOOO much bigger than just the UK, great humor, a nice friendRon (which I love, I hate bashing in general, but mostly when its Ron) the romance is really nice, Tonks and Remus are hilarious, it has one of the best Dumbledore's in fanfiction imo, an actual GG, manipulative, utilitarian but good Dumbledore, doing his best to win the war (and it is A WAR, not a bunch of skirmishes with a single final battle)... I could go on and on about it, I really love this fic. I've talked with author several times these last couple years and I haven't ever managed to figure out if they are a woman or a man, even if they mentioned their husband. The reason the updates take a while is because the author is a EMT(I think that's the acronym) and loves to go caveing, so it takes a while to surface, and sometimes shit happens.

***** I'm reading it rn and while I'm enjoying it I really hate some of the authors quirks when trying to sound British. If I see "sodding" used one more time I'll be tempted to drop the fic there and then. I don't like the romance much either bc honestly Harry's character just changes to something you'd see out of twilight or something always growling and stuff. It's a bit cringy. Let's not even get started on how unrealistically dense Harry is. I'm enjoying the story but these problems really annoy me and also the way the author makes everyone over the top sarcastic and joking about everything when the author is clearly not funny enough for it to work.
