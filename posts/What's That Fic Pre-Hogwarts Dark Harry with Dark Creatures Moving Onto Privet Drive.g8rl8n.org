:END:
I have spent a few days trying to find this fic. I remember that a werewolf lived on Privet Drive and he and his wife took Harry under their wing after the Dursleys left him out on a full moon. Harry was not bitten which confused the couple, but they kept an eye on him after that. The wife (Alex? Ally? It was an 'A' name) liked giving Petunia heart attacks. Harry was a true "dark lord" meaning his magic was naturally dark. It eased the pain of the transformation and because of that, lots of dark creatures, starting with werewolves, moved to Privet. I think there was a hag who opened a bed and breakfast and the werewolves had a construction company.

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.
