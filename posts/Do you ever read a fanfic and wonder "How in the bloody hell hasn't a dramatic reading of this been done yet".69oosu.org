Because I just read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7583739/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Most-Electrifying-Man][Harry Potter and the Most Electrifying Man]] and I'm wondering how nobody has tried to do a dramatic reading of it.

This is the greatest thing I've ever read. While I love about it is that despite the sheer stupidity of the premise, the author still had a few characters try to play it straight and even had an ending uh...semi-plausible according to canon.


** Most people don't do dramatic readings. I'm one of the few people out there who do. I'll take a look at it some time and maybe make something happen. But stuff like that is lowest priority.
