So what would your Horcrux be, where would you keep it and what would you do to protect it?

Mine would be my old teddy bear and my mum would protect it. 100% guaranteed immortality right there haha.

Your turn!

******* Ya. But that weird baby thing wasn't a horcrux. That's his original soul that got forced out of his body when he attacked Harry in 1981. He wanted around as a shade until the created that temporary body he was inhabiting. His horcruxes just stopped his original piece of soul from "passing on." They didn't use any of his horcruxes in the ritual at all so you could technically send your horcrux to space because if u were killed your original soul shade thing would be wandering around in earth still.

*** I think the process of turning an object into a horcux is both dependent on the object being solid (you cant transfigure objects into gasses or liquids for instance) and makes it nearly indestructible, like if you turned a soap bubble into a horcrux it would be the most resilient soap bubble in history. So the bowl of water would probably target the bowl, and the dry ice would never melt (remember that snakes and gold are molten under certain conditions too, their is no privileged reference frame for standard temperature and pressure as it exists on earth).

also, the ritual for horcrux generation presumably requires a relatively small object so that you can put a ritual/rune circle around it, building one of those large enough to encompass the earth might be counterproductive. You could probably turn a modest sized cometary body into one though, hard to get to and hard to destroy. (though its possible that any damage significant enough to mark a horcrux is enough to destroy it since they are nearly invulnerable to begin with; the soul might be tied to the /concept/ of the object as a singular entity rather than merely housed inside its physical structure so any modification of the object vis a vis damage could destabilize or destroy your soul anchor)

** D&D nerd here, y'all ain't got nothing on the munchkins of 3.5 and pathfinder. The real trick is to make your horcrux (phylactery) into the only thing holding back a greater evil, and then you tell everyone exactly what it is. Now they have the choice of being able to kill me or unleashing a million dementors or something suitably world ending. Bonus points if you are the only one capable of stopping and sealing the evil thing in the first place, so then if they get rid of you they not only unleash crazy evil but get rid of the guy who could take care of it. Now they don't want to kill you. Much better than trusting that the merfolk in the marianas trench don't know how to destroy horcruxes. I win.

**** True.

A horcrux is a piece of your soul trapped inside an object. Therefore if I made a horcrux my piece of soul would know that I intend to keep it a secret therefore it would hide it's true nature to the best of it's ability and in the rare chance that it is found the person who finds it, unless they are a truly skilled and knowledgeable wizard would never suspect that the simple stone they are holding would be a horcrux.

I would not be so arrogant and foolish as Riddle, the best way to hide a horcrux would be not to draw attention to itself. ;)

**** I seriously doubt there is such a distinctive difference between magic and /dark magic/ that, among what must be tens to hundreds of enchantments on that train, someone would notice. And even if there was, would enchant other items on the train with a similar type of magic so no one gets overly suspicious.

***** To be fair, that isnt really addressed in cannon, so it is possible (though admittedly unlikely) that dark magic is intrinsically distinct and detectable by relatively common means. However, since people get away with dark magic all the time (like storing not one, but /two/ horcruxes at Hogwarts, one in the /fucking students quarters/ and one in the room that Dumbledore knows about and has visited on occasion, even if not in that particular configuration) then you could probably conceal the dark magic without too much trouble.

****** dark magic leaves traces; i can't remember if it was only in the movie, but, didn't they see visions of him making the horcrux and the cave while inspecting the guant ring. what i was implying though was that over a several decades one person might find it.

** i don't know if voldemort was normal, something went wrong when he died. a horcrux is suppose to hide a piece of your soul, not anchor you in a ghost like state. i imagine normally you'd have to have someone with access to it so they could resurrect you. toms diary was probably the only successful one. i guess his body was killed but the soul inside him wasn't.

i always wondered if the somewhat sane tom in the beginning hid his horcrux in important places for a real reason. i'd probably steal a statue from a museum, something nice. hide it in some kind of underground maze full of infiri and traps and enchanted muggle gun spider type shit. with the entrance to some old castle broom cupboard.

That is exactly what a Horcrux is supposed to do. The word "anchor" is specifically used in the books.

**** but it also says if your part of soul dies the piece in the object lives on. which is why it seemed, to me at least, that what happened to voldemort is unique.

***** No. Slughorn says that if your body is destroyed, your soul still lives, because the piece of soul in the Horcrux anchors it to the world. I suggest you read the parts regarding Horcruxes in HBP and DH before replying.

****** A horcrux has as it's primary purpose the permanent affixation of your soul to the material plane. It is implied that voldie thought it would actually make him literally immortal, like immune to the killing curse and age immortal, but mostly it just prevents you from becoming an actual ghost (which is fixed in location, as opposed to a wraith like voldie became) and from entering the afterlife. It does seem like it would be easier to be revived if someone has easy access to your horcrux (though that is obviously a security risk) but you are immortal and at least somewhat motile so who cares if it takes you a century or two to find a willing victim to posses? Bonus: taking a century or two to revive means all your old enemies are dead and no one is around to stop your rise to power!

Only, it doesn't revive /you/, it revives a separate piece of your soul, which is not a completely "developed" "you" - like Diary!Riddle didn't have the skills nor the knowledge and memories of the original Voldemort past age 16. And I don't think Voldemort would like it very much if his 16 year old self is alive while the original is piggybacking rats in Albania. /He/ wants to be alive, not just have a copy of him alive.

******** i think in an interview she said tom riddles wouldn't have been revived but it would have made voldemort stronger. i don't remember her saying specifically how, but she implied that the diary tom wouldn't have become alive and started on his own.

as for the rest, above, you're probably right, the language used seems a bit confusing.
