Go full dragon ball tropes with it. Dumbledore takes Harry to the room of requirements and trains him for a year. Dumbledore fights Voldemort first and then tags out so Harry can fight, Voldemort could think it's a joke since maybe in this AU he doesn't care about the prophecy, Sirius dies to Voldemort after giving Harry a motivational speech about not giving up causing Harry to go full on ballistic on Voldemort


** So long as Voldie is written like Cell from DBZabridged and has a musical number at the end, I'm all for it!
