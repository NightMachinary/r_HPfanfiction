Nymphadora is trying to add as many people she's done it with as possible. She can turn into every person's ideal lover and therefore no one really resists her. All Hogwarts had been with her, the entire Ministry had between her and almost everyone from the Order (including Dumbledore and Moody). The only thing missing from her collection is a werewolf so she sets her eyes on Remus. But given that Remus is not really interested and the more he resists her attempts to seduce him, the more she falls in love with him.


** Does that mean she shifted into Grindelwald to be with Dumbles?

**** I'd imagine that Moodys fantasy is capturing an alluring dark witch and 'interrogating' her for a few days.

****** Honestly, since JKR never detailed her limit, its up to your imagination but personnally I don't think so. I imagine her able to transform into any human form possible (animal anatomy are too difficult imo) and even why not able to play with her pigmentation like a cuttlefish, but she's not a T-1000.
