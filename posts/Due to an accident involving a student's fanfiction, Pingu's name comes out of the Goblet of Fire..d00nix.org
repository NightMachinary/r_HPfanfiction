** Every pair of eyes was suddenly fixed upon him.

'Noot noot,' he said quietly, shrinking down so he was a flat pool of penguin.

It was no use. 'Pingu,' said Professor Dumbledore again.

He was forced to waddle up the great hall. He could see the other students glaring at him. Whispers of cheat, and "he doesn't even make proper penguin noises" followed him.

He was glad his father wasn't here to see this. He could just imagine him frowning, his pipe sticking out of his beak.

'Noot noot,' he said again desperately when he reached Dumbledore.

'It's a binding magical contract,' Dumbledore said.

Pingu flattened himself again, nooting in despair.
