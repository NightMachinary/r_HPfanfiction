Just want some feedback on what I could improve. Thanks.


** I apologise if I'm blunt, I'm fairly short on time.

Firstly, I'm not sure why you have that authors note summarising what's going to happen at the start. The reader will find all that out as they progress, don't spoil the fun. Your first chapter should establish that Lily and James don't die, and everything else should appear naturally through the text. I won't comment too much on the plot because AU is really not my thing so I'm very biased, but there's 90000 stories out there that sound like this one. So far nothing is leaping out at me that makes me think this could be different, and it's concerning that in your authors notes you suggest you haven't finished planning it out. Doesn't fill me with confidence.

Secondly, while I appreciate gaelic names are awesome, lachlan sounds very odd next to lily, James and harry, and none of those characters are gaelic, so why would they name their son that? It's a small thing I know, but it feels really jarring and is a bit of a red flag for a poorly written OC.

Third, your grammar and spelling isn't awful, but could do with some work. There should be a new paragraph every time a new character speaks. When it comes to dialogue, you're using it for exposition a lot and it doesn't feel natural. This takes a lot of work and practice to correct and there's no easy way I'm afraid, but it's something to focus on.

*** Alright thanks, I'll remove the AN and work on the format now that I have a computer available to me (previously was editing on phone due to being out of the country). I guess I can change his name, would you suggest any alternatives? And yeah, I noticed how when I was writing my characters and their dialogue it felt kind of lifeless and I struggled to make the interactions more free-flowing. Is it possible if you could offer a correction to one dialogue of your choice to show me a better way to have them interact?

**** Yeah definitely always work from a computer - your story can wait, be patient and make sure you've got something of a good quality first.

I would just go with something traditionally English, to be honest. Be very careful when writing OCs that you don't make them too... fantasy. You don't necessarily have to have a dull name of Sam or David or whatever, but the name should make sense in the world you have created.

As for the dialogue and interactions - there's no quick fix I'm afraid, I really struggle with giving advice about this. I would say that part when Lily explains what has happened with the full name of the babysitter is rather clunky. There should be emotion and fear, panic and confusion, I'm not sure many people would give the full name and occupation of a victim like that when they were worried for their own children. It's the same sort of skill that comes with acting - it's about understanding humans and how they respond and react to one another. To practice this, read and copy out dialogue from books and scenes you want to emulate. For you, I think closely studying the climax of POA would be helpful. This is using dialogue for exposition like you do, but Rowling does it in a natural way, with interruptions, tensions running high, emotion and misunderstandings.

***** Okay thanks a lot, I'll look at the scene once I get back to my home (don't have books with me currently). I'm currently going through the two chapters I've done so far and am working on trying to add more life to the characters. It's a hard task but I'm giving it a good go. Thanks again.

****** Good luck :) I recommend finding a beta, if you can. I don't like AU so I'm not a good choice, but I'm sure there's someone else out there who could help you out.

******* Alright, I changed up the first chapter and think I added more character and life to it. At least I hope. I'm gonna start working on chapter 2 soon, but I also realized I need to improve on my use of adverbs, as I use them infrequently and most of the actions are plain due to that (it was bothering me and couldn't put my finger on what it was). Any chance you could give chapter 1 a quick re-read and critique it? Thanks heaps.

** It's awesome that you're open to constructive criticism. Flames are bad and unhelpful and hopefully you'll only find help here.

The plot is one I've seen before, but I've seen some amazing fics that I love that are rehashes of cliche story ideas, so I'll say keep writing it if that's what you really want to do. I do encourage you to put your own special touch on it to make it special. One twist I'd like to see on the wrong bwl trope is to have Harry be the bwl, but somewhat average, while his brother is the exceptional one. Be it smart, powerful, or just extremely driven. And maybe instead of Lily and James immediately forgetting and dismissing Harry, they could have difficulty balancing the community's expectation of their son with the reality that he's just a normal kid.

The main thing I'd recommend looking at is the wording. You've got a combination of purple prose and too little information. It's correct that you don't want flat, boring text, but you also don't want to just toss words on the page to increase your word count. I am far from a literary genius myself, so it may be easier to just point you to an essay that explains it. [[http://writeworld.org/post/39271116749/dont-be-a-dickens-avoiding-purple-prose]]

If you want to add variety and flavor to the writing, try changing the sentence length. Write a short sentence. Next you can write a slightly longer sentence. Then occasionally, but not too often, you can write a much longer sentence that goes into detail on a particular topic, taking care to avoid run-on sentences. Mix that up and your reader's brains won't get bored because the flow is a little more unpredictable and engaging.

I also agree that while Lachlan may be a cool name, it's really out of place in a family consisting of a James, Lily, and Harry. Maybe you could save that name for an unrelated OC later in the story?

There are other things I could say, but it would start to feel like I was trying to take over your story. Write what makes you happy and enjoy yourself.

** The summary is a little grammatically garbled, but it's decent and the tags let people know what to expect. Is there an actual reason for his parents to ignore him, or are you copying a bunch of (mostly shitty) stories that do that to try to keep Harry's childhood neglectful like his canon background despite having living parents? He could just be the second son who doesn't get as much attention because he's not the celebrity.

Your first sentence doesn't make sense. If someone is shrouded in shadows, their face is not visible and therefore a gleeful expressIon can't be seen on their face. Also Godric's Hollow is the name of the village, not of the Potter house.

Second sentence: if the boys are on the second floor, you need to add in Voldemort going up the stairs before he enters their room. You're skipping steps in the action sequence.

Rest of first paragraph: The prose is stilted and you're rushing all of the character descriptions and actions. Yes, HP fanfic readers will be familiar with all the characters, but you can still have more of an introduction. Why not describe more of the scenery to slow down the action and give context to the scene? Include a thought from Voldemort's POV; maybe he can sneer 'stupid mudblood' after killing Lily or eagerly look forward to destroying the threat to his life.

Haven't read the rest but you could use a beta if the rest is similar to the beginning. Happy writing! The more you write, the better you get.
