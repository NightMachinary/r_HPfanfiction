I haven't read much Hermione/Viktor, and I would like to explore the pairing a little bit more. However, I'd like a trio-centric or even Harry-centric fic that has Hermione and Viktor's relationship in the context of the war. I'm not interested in just romance fics right now. I want to see how their relationship intersects with everything else that is happening.


** Frustratingly the name escapes me but there's a Harry X Bellatrix fic with Hermione X Viktor, they end up defending a Bulgarian castle under siege. Does this ring any bells for anyone?

*** This sounds super interesting. I hope someone remembers it! If not, I'll try to do some digging.

**** I keep remembering other details about the siege chapters and get no closer to the name. It's going to be that tip of the tongue feeling for days!? Ugh. Memory! Do better!
