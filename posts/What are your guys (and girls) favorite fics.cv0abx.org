**** Harry visits a diner and drinks coffee every morning. A waitress is interested in finding out who the mysterious person is. She proceeds to bother him for months. I'd rather not give anything else up. You should just read it tbh, it's realllly good.

**** It may be spoilery, but for myself, I think it would have helped to know in advance that Harry has been widowed, and is looking after his three children alone. And then he meets a waitress who brings more sunshine into his life.

It's still in progress, but a great read.

** The Its TeaTime series by frombluetored. 3 separate canon compliant stories (third is a WIP), also canon from CC's POV. Scorbus main ship, but good stories and surprisingly great OC's.

Also, The Armisitice series by Annerb, starting with the brilliant The Changeling, a Slytherin Ginny story.

  Scorpius Malfoy and Albus Potter have decided fifth year is going to be their year; the year everything falls into place for them both and the year they show the bullies they aren't afraid of them. Scorpius receives a prefect badge and Albus is going to join the Quidditch team, if Scorpius can just convince him that he should try out. It's going to be the year everything works out for them, and if that means Scorpius keeping his huge crush on his best friend a secret, then that's just what he's going to have to do.It's just a crush. He can get over it well before fifth year is over, can't he?

** Whenever I think about the characterisation of Ginny, Neville, or Luna, I have to pause and work out whether I'm remembering canon or Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past. It's an older one, so it does a lot of things that have now become cliches, but it does them well. I especially like how the Peggy Sue aspect is balanced, with foreknowledge being offset by the Butterfly of Doom. And seeing Harry take his second chance and focus on building up his friends and making them stronger, and incidentally forging stronger bonds with them, always makes me smile.

Sadly it's incomplete and very slow to update due to author health, though not actually abandoned. And to add insult to injury, FFN took it down in response to bogus claims of copyright violation. You can still find it in several places; I recommend the eBook.

** In the mind of a scientist by ZenoNoKyuubi.

It features a functionally insane Harry, Hermione being 110% done with his obsessive need to advance medical science and Tonks being extremely attractive to Harry due to her Morphing abilities for actual non sexual reasons.

If you like dry witted banter between best friends, people getting opened up (willingly or otherwise) Harry casually spitting in the face of Mother Nature and giving ol' Tommy the metaphorical middle finger you're going to love it.
