I might be being too specific, but these are the kind of things I would like to read. Ideally, it would "add to" established canon rather than alter it -- i'm not a big fan of AU or "harry potter if X was ..." style fics.

Anything come to mind?


** linkffn(to reach without) changes Harry's gender in an interesting way and Harry doesn't accept it easily at first but makes major differences in magic, world building, creatures, politics. It is sadly abandoned though. Still worth the read imo.

Maybe linkffn(princess of the blacks)

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." ON INDEFINITE HIATUS.

** Linkffn(The Arithmancer) has a massive focus on new spells. Lasers, fractal shotgun, custom rituals, transfiguration of uranium. It's pretty close to canon for the first three years but starts to change more and more after that.

  Hermione grows up as a maths whiz instead of a bookworm and tests into Arithmancy in her first year. With the help of her friends and Professor Vector, she puts her superhuman spellcrafting skills to good use in the fight against Voldemort. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

** Does Cursed Child count as canon for you, or are Next-Gen fics still good?

*** I don't see why those should be contradictory. Sure, if /Cursed Child/ is canonical, then pre-/Cursed Child/ next-gen fics have to be retroactively labeled as "AUs" when they used to just be "continuations" --- but so what? That's just ticking a different box in the paperwork. Hardly stops one from enjoying the stories in question, any more than even people who quite accept the /Fantastic Beasts/ movies are going to suddenly stop reading pre-/FB/ fics involving Grindelwald.

**** OP literally mentions that they prefer non-AU. Personally I don't consider Cursed Child canon because it clashes with real canon, but others may not necessarily share my opinion.
