I mean, look at the contents of said trapdoor; Fluffy, Devil's Snare, a flying challenge, a chess challenge, a troll, a logic challenge, and finally the Mirror.

The Mirror, previously encountered by Harry and Ron, they know how it works and how to overcome it. The troll, defeated before by Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Flying, chess, and logic, all appeal to a type of skill that Harry, Ron, and Hermione have previously exhibited. That just leaves Fluffy, who Harry passes through his friendship with Hagrid, and...the Devil's Snare, which is an odd-one-out that doesn't seem to connect with anyone.

Now, look at Harry's relationship with Neville. Flying lesson, Harry saves his Remembrall (compare with Ron/Harry saving Hermione from the troll). Midnight duel, Neville ends up dragged along for the ride. Dragon incident, Neville just happens to be caught out of bounds on the same night after trying to warn Harry. On that note, given that Neville was in the forest that night, tracking unicorn bloodstains, there was a real chance of his encountering 'Quirrelmort'.

Finally, keep in mind that Neville is established as being good at Herbology, and he was awake on the night that the Trio went into the trapdoor.

Now, if you favour a Manipulative!Dumbledore who set up all those traps designed for that particular Trio to bypass them, is it possible, even probable, that he was predicting Neville would accompany them yet again on a late-night excursion, and 'arranged' Devil's Snare to be included in the protections to accommodate that?

That rather than standing in their way (and being body-bind'd for it), Neville might have been aware of the risk of Voldemort's return after what happened in the forest (although it doesn't seem he is in canon, when Harry is returned by Firenze to Hermione and Hagrid, Neville and Draco are nowhere to be seen), and thus joined up with the Trio instead?

Just a thought.


** This idea really made me pause for a moment. There's no doubt in my mind that Dumbledore would do something like this-- after all, we can see that he's rather keen on predicting the actions of Harry's friends (leaves Ron the deluminator, Hermione the clue in the Beetle the Bard book) and setting up situations where Harry will become dependant on others in order to succeed. We can see one of many examples of this HBP and then DH where Dumbledore has told Harry to tell Ron and Hermione, and then makes his success dependant on them as well (as well as Snape telling him he has to die). I've wondered for a long time whether Dumbledore meant to slowly introduce Harry to Voldemort, after all, he keeps telling him "I'll tell you more when you're older". I think Dumbledore very well might've intended Harry to have that initial confrontation in book 1. Maybe he didn't know it was Voldemort exactly, but there was definitely something sketchy going on. It makes sense to train him from a young age if you're going to eventually send him to be slaughtered but the Dark Lord. After all, he let Harry be introduced to the mirror, he watched Harry sit in front of the mirror and try to understand what it was. And then, after revealing the biggest secret of the mirror to Harry Potter, he makes it the final block to the puzzle? It seems more than a bit set up. Your post cause my attention at first because of the fact that it's Neville. He was almost the Chosen One and I'm sure Dumbledore must've practically jizzed in his pants when Harry kept getting caught out with Neville. Two boys who could've fulfilled the prophecy, and they're friends? He probably anticipated (or hoped) that Neville would get dragged along on another adventure. Poor Neville gets used in a manner close to this in GoF so it doesn't seem unlikely that it could've happened in PS as well. The one thing that I feel cements this theory is the teachers Dumbly chose to create protection. All are professors who we have encountered thus far...even though they're first years. Why not have there be a complicated ancient runes problem, or arithmancy? Well, our darling Golden Trio (and Neville) wouldn't know anything about it. Yes, I understand that it may just be JKR doing it so as not to confuse the readers in the last few chapters, but honestly.... A giant chess game? Logic? Devil's Snare? Flying? Why not just make the puzzle their first year examinations with a quiddich game at the end? It'd probably be more difficult than these "protections" Dumbledore has put up to lure HP into his first encounter. Also, it seems a bit too much of a coincidence that Neville just so happened to be in the common room waiting for them that night. Maybe he got a tipoff? (After writing this I realize there's not very much to do with Neville, but it's just my brain vomit and I apologize)

#+end_quote

Hmm. I think Dumbledore planned for Harry to confront Voldemort /eventually/, but Harry exceeded his initial expectations by choosing to confront him at the end of year 1. At the end of OotP, Dumbledore says:

#+begin_quote
  “And then... well, you will remember the events of your first year at Hogwarts quite as clearly as I do. You rose magnificently to the challenge that faced you and sooner - much sooner - than I had anticipated, you found yourself face to face with Voldemort. You survived again.
#+end_quote

The books dance quite a bit around the subject of Dumbledore's early plans for Harry - there /definitely/ is (was) a Plan, Dumbledore confesses as much in OotP. There is something vaguely sinister about it, as Dumbledore says it was absolutely essential for the success of his plan for him not to care about Harry personally.

#+begin_quote
  “Do you see, Harry? Do you see the flaw in my brilliant plan now? I had fallen into the trap I had foreseen, that I had told myself I could avoid, that I must avoid.”

  “I don't --”

  “I cared about you too much,” said Dumbledore simply. “I cared more for your happiness than your knowing the truth, more for your peace of mind than my plan, more for your life than the lives that might be lost if the plan failed. In other words, I acted exactly as Voldemort expects we fools who love to act.
#+end_quote

Dumbledore considered his time in the hospital wing at the end of year 1 his first great test. Harry passed his own test with flying colours, and now it was time for Dumbledore to do his self-appointed duty. But seeing Harry lying half dead shakes him. He does not reveal the prophecy, as he had planned. Dumbledore does not have the necessary ruthlessness or uncaringness to carry out his Plan to the finish. Overall, he fails quite miserably.

So did Dumbledore plan a good portion of year one's plot? A lot of things certainly point in that direction. Towards the end of PS, Harry says:

#+begin_quote
  “No, it isn't,” said Harry thoughtfully. “He's a funny man, Dumbledore. I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I don't think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked. It's almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could...”
#+end_quote

It fits the best with the events of the first year. It fits very well into the idea of Dumbledore /Plan/ - which is seemingly to train him up to face Voldemort eventually. It certainly fits into Dumbledore's MO - he does something similar in Deathly Hallows as well.

Although..

#+begin_quote
  It makes sense to train him from a young age if you're going to eventually send him to be slaughtered but the Dark Lord.
#+end_quote

I don't think Dumbledore knew of the Horcrux at this stage, and if there's no horcrux there's little need for Harry to be slaughtered.

** I don't really like to think of Dumbledore as manipulative, and I haven't given much thought yet to those interesting Neville parallels you noticed, but I'm just gunna go off on a side point here. We know Dumbledore had access to time turners.... And yet everyone immediately shuts down any time-traveling Dumbledore theories, but I've never heard a better explanation for how he always knows everything, like how he already was in the room when Harry was at the Mirror of Erised, when he arrived at the Ministry for Harry's hearing 4 hours early, when he brought Firenze in right as Trelawney was being fired, how he knew about Ron and the Deluminator, he just always knows what's going to happen before it happens

*** Why do you need any time-travelling to explain any of that? You hardly need a be a seer to know that Trelawney was going to be fired (he had probably contacted Firenze long before and brought him into Hogwarts when he got a message as to what Umbridge was doing). The ministry pulling off that kind of fuckery was very predictable. Dumbledore probably can't keep away from the mirror himself - his personal demons go so much farther than Harry's (and ultimately kill him). Ron and the deluminator was probably a stretch on Harry's part - Dumbledore just gave the trio a tool to stay together in case they were accidentally separated.

** That is definitely my thoughts, though I don't really like the ideas entailed by the usual phrase of "Manipulative!Dumbledore" --- because in the case of the traps I don't think there's anything /wrong/ with what Dumbledore did. However, yes, it has always been my understanding that the traps were tailored for Harry and his closest friends: animal for Hagrid, plant for Neville, flying for Harry, chess for Ron, riddle for Hermione. And assuming Quirrell didn't bring it down first, the Troll would also do for all of them together, since they'd demonstrated troll-defeating abilities earlier the same year.

The only place I disagree with is the Mirror. For me, the point of the entire exercise was that while Harry and Co. could get through, and no other students, it would also be an easy path for Voldemort or any other thieves, who would then find themselves trapped when they arrived in front of the Mirror with no idea how to get the Stone out and no way to go /back/ since the potion only lasted for one go. The endgame was to have Harry (whom Dumbledore assumed would see his parents again, and thus pose no threat to the Stone) and Voldemort confront each other in a "controlled environment", giving Harry a chance to fulfill the Prophecy before he even knew it existed.

***** I wasn't saying it was evil. You said it wasn't wrong, and that's just ridiculous. Purposely setting up a few 11 year olds to take on extremely dangerous obstacles and then the darkest wizard in history is absolutely fucked up. Evil? No, of course not, but if Dumbledore really did purposely set it up like that, he should be kicked out of Hogwarts. All 3 of them could have been killed.

Imagine if a principle in today's world put a wild dog in an empty part of the school and then set up kids to go into that area. Yes, I know they wouldn't have magic, but that's why I said one wild dog instead of a giant cerberus and a murderous plant.

******* No, I really don't. Because a normal dog doesn't compare even a little to a freaking /cerberus/. I made up for the differences.

Because if you don't think a giant cerberus, even with their knowledge of how to get past them, devils snare, a troll, and Lord fucking Voldemort isn't so much ridiculously more dangerous than one wild dog, you're nuttier than Dumbledore is.

** Whether or not the author's intention matters in how you interpret things is a topic up for debate itself, but I'm fairly certain when Rowling wrote book one she hadn't intended Dumbledore to have set up the tasks specifically so that the kids could get past them, but rather she wanted the kids to get past them so she devised tasks that they were capable of. In general a lot of plot points seem to happen that way, the plot needs the characters to do y in situation x so thats what happens, rather than in situation x the characters would do y so that's what they do.

*** While I agree with you, it's also a bit more complicated than that if you're less of a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist][Doylist and more of a Wastonian]] -- in other words, if you're reading things by interpreting purely through the lens of the text.

Dumbledore is supposed to be one of the greatest wizards who ever lived, so the fact that he hid an object coveted by a murderous Dark Wizard in a school full of children, hidden by a series of obstacles that were solvable by eleven-year-olds will likely led to one of two conclusions:

1) Either Dumbledore is dangerously incompetent, or

2) he set everything up knowing exactly what he was doing.

Now, given that we are shown and told over and over again that he is, in fact, a very skilled wizard, and one who is ultimately /not/ above hiding significant things from other people, it's understandable why there are so many manipulative!Dumbledore fics out there -- that interpretation saves him from being both a dumbass and inconsistently-characterized.

*Edit*: That said, I've yet to find a manipulative!Dumbledore that I actually find remotely competent and/or readable.

** Yes, I believe this to be the case.

The only other scenario that I believe could be what happened is that it was all a trap to capture Voldemort, and, had Harry not destroyed Quirrelmorts body, he would never have been able to leave. In this case, it was just bad luck that Harry and co. decided to get invested, and the stone in the mirror was just a decoy.
