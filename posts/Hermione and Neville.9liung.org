Do you think that Hermione and Neville would have made a good couple? I love how into him she is in this parody video: [[https://youtu.be/lN40ZG9vso8]]


** lol is this what's called 'so bad it's good'?

And yeah, I can see Hermione and Neville working... There's a few fics with that pairing (usually more in the background though).

*** yeah, it's interesting how she is the first person to be friends with him since you see her helping him on the Hogwarts Express in the first book so it seems like he would always remember that
