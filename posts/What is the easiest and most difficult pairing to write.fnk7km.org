in your opinion ?


** Easiest /and/ most difficult?

Harry/Cho as a lasting pairing. It's easy to get them together. It's also easy to do away with the Cedric problem. She clearly liked Harry in 4th year. It's a great pairing for character growth. The difficult part is Marietta and two teenagers believably overcoming that.

** Canon pairings.

Easiest because they already exist. Hardest because they have existing material to work around. You want a Harry/Susan, Harry/Daphne or Harry/Gabrielle paring then you can, for all intents and purposes make up a new character perfect for what you want. If you stick to canon but get it wrong you'll annoy someone out there. If you stick with a canon pairing some people will expect a story that works with canon in every aspect so you have more stuff that might trip you up.

*** isnt it also difficult with non canon pairings to build a fully believable character from in some cases fragments so they are not fully fleshed out but are also not just a name on a page

**** When there are so few fragments/limits the character can be whatever you want/need them to be. Making a believable character in my opinion often comes down to them having goals and taking actions towards achieving them or alternatively having consistent behaviour. When a character suddenly acts differently to their established behaviour for no apparent reason other than 'plot demands it' then the character is less believable. That doesn't have to mean every character is working towards world domination. A character having a poorly defined goal is a great reason to have a poorly motivated character. Ron not knowing what he wants from life, as his brothers have already achieved a lot, explains why he seems to coast by at times. He just wants to have fun and for his friends to be safe. As such he relaxes but takes action when his friends are in danger. Giving a character an established backstory isn't all that important. We know almost nothing about Hermione's parents and yet that doesn't make Hermione a bad character. If her parents were a more important plot point then no doubt we would learn a lot more about them.

** Most difficult is anything where the fandom thinks they know the character but really in canon there isn't much information. Someone like McG is a good example. We know some things, but really her character is pretty open in canon. BUT in the fandom??? She's a very different person. I think it's also harder to write and gain an audience for any pairing that flies directly in the face of canon and diverges in an almost unbelievable way. I'm looking at you Neville/Hermione. haha

**** Do they? I'm not so sure. There are so many background characters that have so much depth I think you could argue a pairing that fits right into canon and wouldn't diverge too much you know?

I'm talking divergence like two people who could not *believably* be interested in each other. I have no idea who McG would be interested in and we have no evidence to support any romantic interest on her part with anyone in any way. So it's open and therefore more difficult, in my opinion.

** Not a writer, but to me Harry/Draco and Harry/Snape and Draco/Hermione just aren't credible to me unless you write a completely AU version of the characters.

** Harry/fleur unless you change their character completly i don't see how the can end up together. Harry/daphne or susan easiest because they can be made to fit harry anyway you want

**** Fleur is older and i got the impression she liked good looking men, cedric roger and bill. harry was just a skinny boy three years younger i don't see how they can end up together at least not at that age. Maybe when they both are older

***** It's shown she can overcome her shallowness when Bill is scratched, but Harry is also tall and handsome by HBP. I'll admit I'm partial to the pairing, but it seems like a pretty easy friends to lovers story that can include Bill for drama, but that's not necessary.

** In my opinion, it doesn't matter who's being paired with who, as long as I have a very good understanding of their character (e.g. can I break down their personalities into key components) then it's easy. So I know a lot about Draco and Ginny so I can easily write those two BUT I know very little about Susan and Dean so I couldn't write any pair which includes them, I'd find it too difficult.
