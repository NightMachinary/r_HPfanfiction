Basically, a general theme you see across HPFF that you dislike.

For me, it has to be the complete lack of creativity when it comes to pairings involving side characters. I'll be honest, I'm really tired of the common romantic interests like Hermione and Ginny. There's basically nothing left to write about them hasn't already been written, and reading about the same two people getting together across so many different stories is boring honestly.

So who does that leave? Side characters like Cho and Lavender but there's almost nothing written about them. Cho and Lavender have base canon traits that can be easily expanded upon. Harry having a gift for Divination and bonding with Lavender over it? No, have another marriage contract Ice Queen Daphne story. Harry and Cho getting into a friendly rivalry over Quidditch before their 4th year? No, have another soul bond Gabrielle story. Are you picking up a theme? People would rather use OC stand-ins rather than side characters, which I see as a absence of creativity, because it's harder to build a side character, while staying true to the canon, than it is to make an OC.

It's a shame because there's one thing Katawa Shoujo fanfiction has showed me, it's that a good writer can turn a nothing side character into a main character that have just as much depth as a canon main character, while staying true to the canon.


** How Ron gets treated poorly in fanfic, either not being a significant character a lot of the time or being a joke character. Come on, canonically, he's been willing to overcome his fears and has shown some strategical brilliance, he's not an idiot.

****** Fine, 11 years old, but on his first time meeting someone famous, he asks about the thing that made said person famous. How is that inexcusable?

Ron's family is overbearing (Molly, in particular), annoying (Ginny), occasionally cruel (twins and pranks), stuck up and sees him as an annoyance (Percy), or, in the case of Bill and Charlie, examples who can do no wrong and whom he can never compare to (or so he feels, see Mirror of Erised). Ron has /too much/ family. He /can't/ understand what it's like to be Harry, and Harry 's not the type to bitch about how bad he has it at home.

Right, just like how blind people knowingly choose not to see things. There's a huge difference between being tactless and malicious, and you apparently can't recognize that that asking a question without stopping to think how someone might feel about it doesn't mean the person decided to be intentionally hurtful.

All I said was 'if' I was in Harry's position, I wouldn't have dealt with half the shit Ron put Harry through(First Year On the train, Second year with the flying car, Fourth Year with his jealousy of Harry, despite being unable to control how he got chosen by the goblet). I think Ron, attempts to be a good person at times, but that doesn't change his bigotry(hate against all Slytherins), his petulance(Best friend of 4 years, going into a tournament where he could die, and he is worried about fame), or his constant disregard for other people's emotions or feelings ("Emotional Range of a teaspoon").

**************** You drew the conclusion that he's a terrible character either without acknowledging positive traits, or based off partially incorrect information

You don't need to have an argument about your opinion, but when your opinion reveals that you're misunderstanding something, or that you have a point of view that is contrary to what is otherwise agreed upon to be correct, people are going to ask and argue about why. See the joke about the best way to find the answer to a question online being to submit an incorrect answer.

If you're saying you would do something different in Harry's position you have to acknowledge things from Harry's point of view.

Again, the first year on the train, you are judging Ron off a couple of moments that you are remembering to be worse than they were.

The second year, yes the car was a dumb idea, but Harry didn't think of a better solution in time either, and again, panicked 12 year olds aren't known for good decision making. Fourth year you're judging Ron more harshly, when the majority of the school felt the same way, for the same reasons.

#+begin_quote

And that makes him a terrible character how? He's bigoted, but very few Slytherins have given him reason to be otherwise. And he's not the only one. Consider how Hagrid described Slytherin house in book 1. He's envious of Harry in the tournament, when it was stated that precautions were taken to avoid people dying like in previous tournaments. As if he's the only one in the school envious of Harry. And he disregards people's emotions at times, admittedly, but that's never done out of malice. Some people just aren't good at dealing with emotions, their own or others. Ron just happens to be oblivious on top of it. The line you quote, "emotional range of a teaspoon" was Hermione explaining the same person's emotions to /Harry/. For all that Ron's character is kind of an idiot (look at how he handles coursework), Harry's not much better off that scene.

Remember that at the final battle it was Ron who thought of the safety of the house elves.

** Cho and Lavender are two characters who have been UNJUSTLY maligned in the fandom.

The fact that they both stayed at Hogwarts to fight was a statement to their characters. Cho already graduated and was NOT even at school, and she was pretty much thrown out of DA after the Marietta disaster. Lavender suffered humiliation at the hands of the Trio after the Won-Won fiasco, but she held no grudges against them, became a core member of the DA in Year 7, suffered through many tortures probably, and perhaps died fighting.

I definitely would like see more fics with these two girls as main characters.

I think pretty consistently, any young character with girly-girl or feminine traits is bashed in canon, apart from /the one time/ Hermione dresses up in GOF. Not outright criticised, but dismissed as being stupid or empty-headed. But at the same time, JKR is really, /really/ on board with elevating motherhood and marriage for I think, every single female character in the books, apart from e.g. Umbridge or Rita Skeeter.

As a former math major, I was intrigued to see higher math get invoked in the HP universe. The titular protagonist is frighteningly intelligent and very capable, but the adversaries are correspondingly more capable to still provide a challenge. There were more than a couple points where I was honestly unsure if the protagonist would pull it out, and the solution didn't involve anything that was obviously a deus ex machina.

** A PSA to everyone posting with a "thing they dislike": write a fic that fixes it. This is an open community with almost no barrier to entry. My beef? Slash pairings in this fandom in general are terrible. Why are there so many harry/snape fics and so few harry/Cedric, krum, weasley or Neville fics? And that's not even scratching truly minor characters.

So I'm writing one. I have a strong suspicion that everyone's going to hate it. A slash fic that takes place primarily in America and absolutely littered with ocs is not a strong place for fic readers.

And I'm doing it anyway.

And I encourage you all to screw your righteous courage to the sticking point and write one too. You want c&c, ask and tons of people on this forum will give it.

**** Here is the only thing I know about writing; if you do it every day, and if you have someone who you trust read and critique your writing, you get better. James Spookie (here's the [[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/649126/James-Spookie](link]] to his profile)) has written 11 fanfictions, most of which ship the same characters, Harry and Daphne. Spend five minutes and compare his first fic ,linkffn(harry potter and the betrothal contract by james spookie)), to his current most recent iteration, linkffn(the legacy preservation act). They have almost identical plots (harry and daphne have to get married!) but everything else, from technical aspects of writing, spelling, to dialogue and character motivations is improved. He writes a LOT; more than a million words in his fics. He's also not what anyone would describe as a giant of the fic world. But - and this is most important - he's better than he was, which, like the man said, is the only true nobility.

The other thing I wanted to talk about is socialization. Take it from someone who spent an entire year teaching himself how to have a sense of humor, hanging out with people is worth it. Whatever your passion is, whether its ice skating or chess or cats, hang out with people who share that passion. Or if you don't have a passion (been there) find one you can fake until it feels real. Cat shelters (one of the places I hang out at a lot) love volunteers, you get to hang out with awesome cats and you always have a conversation topic (either "that orange cat is gorgeous"! or "do you have any cats at home"? spoiler: the answer is always yes).

***** So it might be a better idea to write some one shots before delving into making an idea of a long story probably? I usually just give up because it feels clunky, and harder to continue.

For the hanging out with people who share similar things I like which is essentially only programming, and fantasy books majorly. I do go to a website to chat about and am a mod there, but mostly that doesn't 'feel' like real socializing, and if I try to incorporate it, it feels kindof weird to have in the story.

Thanks for the advice.

****** No, I think you should write whatever comes to mind. If you have a story burning in your heart, write that. If you don't have that story, find the smoldering cinder and blow and that to see what happens. The more I write, personally, the more I want to write. Every word on the page makes me want to write more words. If you clicked into this threat originally because you think there's something missing from the fandom (whatever it is), THAT'S it, that's the cinder. Sometimes you're going to blow on it and it'll go out. That's fine. Maybe dump it, maybe shelve it and look at it again later. But now you've got however many thousands of words of practice to use in trying to bring your next cinder to life!

On the subject of hanging out. If you're looking to practice basic human interaction (I say this without judgement; like I said, I spent 4-6 hours, every friday night for a year practicing having a sense of humor) then my recommendation is cat shelters. I'm weird, but that's fine, people there are weird too. You'll speak to old ladies who will talk about their wonderful cat pickles that died before vietnam. You'll talk to huge biker dudes that whisper sing song to cats. And you'll get to hang out with cats, who, love you or hate you, won't do it because of your social skills. On passion, If I were you I'd try to track down a local gaming (or comic) store, stop in and ask about board game nights or d&d. There'll be people there that love programming and fantasy (it's honestly almost a prerequisite) and even if they don't, you can just play the game with them.

First of all, as the age difference between myself and the Hogwarts students grows so does the grossness factor of any physical romance being read. Second of all, I am at the point in my life where one night stands and casual sex tend to develop into heavier romanace, which works for older characters, but feels weird reading about for teenagers. The shy getting to know each other phase over forty chapters and then kissing drives me crazy.... but not because the author did something wrong. Thirdly and lastly.... I feel like I have read it all, even with new characters it's just the same story again and again.

It's just tough really get into stories about teenagers, especially romances after 13ish years of reading the same universe.

** Now I would take the opposite view. It frustrates me that writers shoehorn the name of a canon character into what is to all intents and purposes an OC (Because there is no actual character in canon; it's just a name in most of those cases). I tend to think it shows a lack of creativity in not bothering to create a well rounded, believable original character. After all, JK introduced new characters all the time, so I can't understand why it seems so undesirable to do it in fanfiction. But apart from the usual pet peeves, what I really dislike (lack of creativity again) is stories that go on and on and on for chapter after chapter without any discernible hint of a plot. I sort of get it; that people just want to read about the characters forever without the story ever ending, but personally I want a story with some literary meat.

*** It's harder to get people to read stories with OCs. Also when you use the name of an existing character, the reader already associates certain traits and feelings to that character, so it's kinda like cheating.

Even if the character is barely recognizable, the name gives the reader a sense of familiarity. Something to compare and contrast against. So the author doesn't have to work as hard to make the reader invested in the character because the reader already somewhat feels invested in that character because of the name.

Of course... there's limits to this. And you're definitely right that a lot of authors take it way too far by making the characters into something so alien that it's more distracting that they used the character's name than it is familiar.

*** That really isn't the "opposite view" so much as a corollary. I think what OP meant is more that there are side characters who DO have a personality - the examples given being Cho and Lavender - who are either shoved aside to make way for what you describe (the "near-OC" type of character) or straight-up demonised. Nonetheless, I do agree with you that writers shouldn't be afraid to create OCs.

** My personal dislike is the repeated retelling of PS/SS but with some variation.

We get Privet Drive -> Letters -> Hagrid -> Diagon Alley -> Express -> Sorting -> First Flying Lesson - > Malfoy Duel and so on. We get it over and over and over again with Slytherin Harry, Harriett, Super Rationalist Harry, Proto-Dark-Lord Evil Harry, Time-travelling Harry from the future reliving his life etc.

While I don't have a problem with those variations as such (I am fairly partial to a competently written girl-Harry). I dislike the fact so many authors insist on starting at book one and I must to wade through this far-too familiar story yet again. And because fics often run out out of steam, these ones do tend to die before the author gets to book three, Hence there seems to be a lot of them.

So yeah. If anybody really does fancy gender-swapping the trio, why not just say to hell with the first six books and start it at the camping trip from hell. That would be a nice change.

**** I agree with you about that, I'm just saying that I don't think that wizards themselves are so backwards. For example, I've seen a lot of fanfiction talking about or showing muggles learning about the wizarding world through cameras. I don't understand why people assume that wizards don't have spells that could work around this. There's no sign in the books about wizarding society being stagnant in terms of inventions (Fred and George are a good example) so why would they ignore muggles like that? I can understand some wizards thinking that muggles are inferior, but wizards would have to be incredibly stupid to not keep up with muggles and find new ways to continue staying secret from them when muggles are the reason their society is secret in the first place.

I said this in my original post- even if the average wizard like Mr. Weasley doesn't know much about muggles, that doesn't mean that there can't be specialists. Kind of like how most people are aware of how a computer works in basic terms, but only specialists could actually sit down and explain it step by step, I imagine there would be a specific group of people who work intimately with muggles and muggle society every day that are a lot more knowledgeable. These people would be the ones who find out about new muggle technology and muggle wars/politics.

Their society isn't a wonderland. There are obvious faults- they're not perfect. I'm just saying that they're not stupid. I kind of wish the books explored the world a little more in those terms (how wizards deal with muggles, how wizards around the world interact, etc), but that wouldn't have been too relevant to the story.

***** Yannow, I started this commented listing example after example of wizarding stupidity, but I think I'm gonna take a different route.

The first powered flight was on December 17th, 1903. The first transatlantic flight took place in June of 1919. 16 years. The first circumnavigation by plane in 1924. The first manned moon landing on July 20th, 1969. It took well under a century to go from powered flight to moon landing, and while I grant that designing a rocket is different from a plane, it's hard not to compare the two.

That's what muggles can do. What can wizards do?

The first known broom shows up in a manuscript from the 10th century. So, they've got flight before muggles by a millennium. However, they're noted for being extremely uncomfortable. It wasn't until *1820* that somebody came up with a magical solution. That's not say they had any sort of sense and tied a cushion to their broom, because even in the 12th century, there were writings about how uncomfortable brooms were. 200 years and nobody thought to stuck a bag full of grass to the things. Also, despite broomsticks being a 10th century invention, they don't get around to flying them across the Atlantic until the 20th century.

This is why people think wizards are all suffering some kind of intellectual disability. It's because /they are/. Virtually every example of a notable witch or wizard is somebody who has done something incredibly stupid with magic. We're talking about a society that has at their disposal the most advanced and powerful technology imaginable, and yet nobody has taken advantage of it. The mere fact that the wizarding world exists at all in its current state is a testament to how brainless these people are. Muggles did more in /50 years/, playing tricks on the laws of physics, than wizards did in a millennium while being able to /rewrite/ the laws of physics as they see fit.

I've always found it extraordinarily difficult to explain what the hell is going on there. In order to explain this, you'd have to come up with some crazy shit happening to prevent the development of magical civilization. Otherwise, you just have to take the leap and say they're suffering from a case of terminal stupidity. The only other possibility is that they just don't have any drive, and that's not how humans work. It hasn't been how humans worked since before humans as we know them today existed. You'd have to go far enough back to find humanoids resembling chimpanzees more than us to strip our drive away from us. You just can't say wizards don't have it.

I think a partial explanation of wizardry's lack of innovation is simply that the talent pool is tiny. The population is minute. If we accept that using spells is straightforward, but devising new ones is very hard indeed, then the number of people able to make those innovations is quite small - the Twins can do this, but they're quite a rare sort.

Well, that's the best explanation I can come up with.

****** I don't think how fast they created things is very relevant. Who cares how long it took for them to create comfortable broomsticks? There were probably logical issues with it- like the problem of instability when trying to fly with a pillow tied to a stick. It took humans a pretty long time to create airbags for those horrifying car crashes we kept suffering. Or just a form of transportation that doesn't involve a living creature that doesn't need to take a break every once in a while. Just because it's magic doesn't mean it's easier to create things. They have the potential to use magic to do anything- they just have to figure out /how/ to get there first.

******* We're talking about sticks that can apparently support and fly with a human straddling it. Even Potterverse magic isn't so nutty that adding a pillow would somehow damage that.

It may have taken a while for us to get airbags, but we've been advancing automobile safety since automobiles were a thing. Even still, it hasn't been /that long/ compared to the slow development of wizarding society. It's only been about a century or so since the Model T was put on the market. Since then, we've made our advances slowly, but consistently, in road safety. Also keep in mind that the progression of automobile safety has increased with need. We wanted faster cars, so we made them faster. We wanted more cars, and more people started driving. It got more dangerous, but we kept working on it. Highways as we know them, and the way we use automobiles, are barely older than any modern safety systems like airbags, bumpers, and attached mirrors.

We're talking, again, roughly a century to go from the first widely manufactured cars to the car of today, and in that time we've identified all sorts of problems and potential improvements, so much so that the first cars driving on the first roads are virtually from another world compared to today. All modern driving is still new, and we've already come a very long way. This is a process that the wizarding world simply does not understand.

If you want another example, cauldrons are older than Christianity, but self-stirring cauldrons are apparently a 20th century invention. That's absurd. You can't say that's a result of not knowing how to make it work. We're talking about /making a stick move in a circle/. If wizards couldn't manage that until the 20th century, what exactly were they doing with magic up to that point? Following that chain of logic, if we assume that wizards weren't all just massive idiots, then magic must have been exceptionally useless until the 20th century. However, we know that's not the case. The broomstick example alone says that, but we have examples of advanced magic dating back to Classical Greece.

And even if we /still/ accept some kind of strange limitations in magic, we already have a number of modern examples using established magic. How many students continued to use irrelevant, virtually harmless spells against /Death Eaters/ during the battle of Hogwarts? How is it that Polyjuice is easy enough for a particularly smart 1st year to make, but nobody thought to test professors or Ministry employees during a time of danger? Same goes for the Imperius, since it's easy enough for a 7th year to cast. Where are the Broom Corps? Why are there no fireplace shields in a world with teleporting fireplaces? Why does nobody use an actual enchanted shield to block spells?

I could go on and on, but if I that doesn't convince you that wizards have no idea what they're doing, then I don't know what will.

Also, I'm not trying to be a dick about this so apologies if I come off as one. I'm mostly only doing it cause it forces me to organize the idea in a way people can actually understand.

  I agree with you about that, I'm just saying that I don't think that wizards themselves are so backwards. For example, I've seen a lot of fanfiction talking about or showing muggles learning about the wizarding world through cameras. I don't understand why people assume that wizards don't have spells that could work around this. There's no sign in the books about wizarding society being stagnant in terms of inventions (Fred and George are a good example) so why would they ignore muggles like that?
#+end_quote

Two points.

We have been shown that the muggle studies topics are quite outdated, indicating that they do not keep up with developments. And that in the topic that suffers most from being behind the times, the topic that is supposed to preparte young wizards and witches for interaction with the muggle world.

Second point, their protection is shown to depend on mental effects influencing direct witnesses. If you are not when the oblivators arrive they can not wipe your memories. If you sit miles away in a control room watching the cctv monitors no wizards can trace the signals back to you to find you. Now that leads directly to the third point.

Well I guess, we have three points now.

Third point, records! That cctv video showing wizards doing wizardly things ends up on VHS or a harddisc or DVD somewhere, probably not even in the same room as the person watching it live on the screen. And we have seen no indication whatsoever that wizards have the slightest awareness of what possible danger that may pose. But even more basic - what if a social worker has been to the Dursleys about Harry or the police has been called out there and then Dumbledore came by and wiped their memories and put Harry back with the Dursleys (common in fanfics). Now what? The social worker's appointment had been scheduled and a report filed afterwards. It is on the files now. Same with the police. The callout is on the records and the control room keeps track while it is happening and afterwards reports are filed. All of these go to a lot of different places to be tagged, classified and reviewed. What do you think happens when Dumbledore wipes the witnesses' minds? Their reports are still in the system. But what if Dumbledore was quick and wiped their minds before they could write up their reports? Congratulation, he now has created a red flag in the system, there is a record of a callout and the people that went can't remember. That requires investigation. With fully kept records.

The big problem the wizards' security is designed for a time before cameras, when a man's word counted for more than a pile of papers. And it is getting worse. Because we know what lies in the future of Harry Potter's world. Camera phones in every pocket, automatic uploads into the cloud, constant tracking by every advertiser... and wizards who are so assured in their own superiority that they can't be arse to keep note of what their "lessers" are up to.

I suppose from a writer's point of view it can be really annoying when people come into your Daphne story with the expectation that she's an Ice Queen. Also it's a pretty tired trope at this point and doesn't even have "well, what can we do, it's canon" behind it.

I'd say that most people were intrigued by Ice Queen Daphne when they first read about her, but now basically every story about Daphne makes her an Ice Queen who's friends with Tracy Davis and is a part of a neutral or gray family. It's been done before and it's boring. I'm guessing a lot of people here want to see original ideas above all else and the idea of a fanon conflicts with it.

** The twins are almost always good guys. Maybe their pranks in canon were not funny, but many things they do in stories, which other characters consider funny really isn't. Mostly, it's the twin speak I can't stand. One day I'll find a story that they try it and don't stop when asked, where Harry (or whomever) will Crucio them until they stop being annoying, or their brain gets fried and I'll treasure that moment! /mini-rant over

Dumbledore's portrayals as evil/manipulative, but also totally fooled and "outwitted" by 12 year old Harry, in a completely idiotic way. It could happen (if Harry drank felix felicis and sacrificed 13 virgins, 7 pregnant women and an infant in a dark ritual to get enough of an edge for that), but if you make him an evil overlord don't write him as utterly incompetent, or at least give a reason why.

Same with Voldemort now that I think about it, but then from what I remember, an incompetent Voldemort is canon.

People upset with authors not sticking to canon characterization. A close-to-canon Harry was interesting when I was 9 i.e. when I started the books, but now? Not so much. I'd be surprised if that wasn't true for at least some of those people. I also can't help but wonder how long it's been since they actually read the books.

It doesn't matter if Harry was raised in another universe, traveled in the past, is a thousand years old, has women waiting in line for him etc. there's a greater than 50% chance the perfect woman (girl, really) for him is Hermione!

Fleur/Tonks is viewed as a sex toy, but Harry is immune to her allure(!!1)/hasn't asked her to change her form(!!1), so they get wet at the sight of his scrawny, undernourished, 14 year old form.

And one that's true for most ff, not just hpff: People not tagging pairings and slash or femslash. The ff.net search feature is absolute shite. Fortunately, there are ways around that, but if it's not mentioned in the summary I can't filter those stories out (doesn't help it could be femmeslash, fem!slash, yaoi, boy love etc). Not that ao3 where they tag stories e.g. het when the pairing that's referring to plays practically no role in the story, while the main pairing i.e. the people the story is about is slash/femslash w/e.

There's +probably+ definitely other stuff too, but this has turned into enough of a rant already. Sorry about that.

** I dislike 99.9% of it. There's never any deeper fanfiction that I come across. Never anything particularly clever or smart about fanfics, even the ones that have a clever premise seem to use them more as a vehicle to get to the ship outcome they want or to fix problems they have with the series rather than telling an interesting coherent story.

I find a lot of fics also don't know when to end, like authors can't let go of a story or never have a plan in mind as to where it's leading.

Lastly I think the magic part of the series sometimes ruins fics. One of my favourite fics is linkffn(Stay Standing), it's not the most well written fic ever but it tells a good character story about Ron and the Weasleys, brings up some good character flaws in a story way without bashing and is a really interesting look on canon characters with a kind of original story. I've never finished it though because what starts out as a story about Ron having magic cancer and how he, his friends and family deal with it eventually devolves into Ron has a magical demon or something and I lose all interest when I get to that part of the story.
