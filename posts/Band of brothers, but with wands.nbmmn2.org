Howdy. So, I've been thinking about the concept of fighting in a war/military action/close approximation and the close ties that such creates between soldiers. I then, of course, wanted to read a story about such. Are there any in this fandom? I'd honestly prefer a story that has a few more characters than just Those Three, but really I just want to read about the sheer level of friendship that battle buddies get to, and the battles in which they fight. Thanks in advance.


** Yes!

Harry

Hermione
