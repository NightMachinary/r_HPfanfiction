I'm looking for strongly pro-Muggle fics where this is the main plot or an important subplot; no character bashing; canon pairings and novel length preferred but not required. Everyone seems to favor the wizards in this regard, so I'd welcome a change of pace. I know about Invincible Technomage and the Muggle subplot it HP and the Natural 20, so I'm looking for something along those lines. One caveat to that: no scifi, please. I'd like the tech to be something we actually have. I understand that this is a rather specific request, so it's OK if the fic only fits some of these criteria.


** Have you read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036071/1/With-Strength-of-Steel-Wings][with strength of steel wings]]?

It has a very big subplot about muggles who find out about magic and are working to make it public and trying to find counter measures

**** I jumped right into it ad found it to be very good. It does descend into some old cliches of OP!Harry and Ron bashing, but it's a testament to the excellent writing that these things didn't put me off of the fic as soon as they appeared, as they often do.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6439871/1/A-Different-Halloween][A Different Halloween]] has a relatively major subplot in the later chapters where the three Marauders (James and Lily survived Voldemort's attack, in this version) join forces with Hermione Granger's dad and start making magical television - they never really address the fact that they're essentially stealing large amounts of movies and TV shows from the Muggles, by broadcasting them to Wizarding Britain without paying any royalties, but apart from that, it's very pro-Muggle and (blatantly) advocates in favor of increased integration between the magical and Muggle worlds.

***** Having finished this one, I can say it contains an idea I have not read anywhere else. Dudley, who becomes the boy who lived, defeats Dumbledore with a 'lightsaber' that the marauders made after seeing the star wars films.

That... is the only thing I remember...

***** I have written so many posts on this subject because every time someone new asks, I've lost those posts -_-

Basically, his characters are one-dimentional demi-gods and he absolutely wastes all interesting plot elements, especially the goblins, by practically making them into deus ex machina that overpower Harry. The 11-year olds (or younger) falling in love is squicky and treating Hermione as a damsel and Harry as tween-age knight in golden armor made of chivalry and hat-tipping is borderline offensive. Bashing the Weasleys/Dumbledore is nearly identical from story to story as well as most of the other independent!Harry tropes.

Yes, he's written a lot of stories and finished all of them, and that's great. He's one of the most consistent writers of Indy!Harry, HHR, MoB!Dumbledore, Bashed!Weasleys, and Helpful!Goblins. Because of that, though, he's kinda like the Pewdiepie of Fanfiction. He's appealing to the lowest common denominator: the younger folks who couldn't give a shit about quality plot and only care to see Harry kick ass and get the girl.

If other authors and readers are honest, they can see that they are jealous that, like Pewdiepie, that shit sells like hotcakes while their stories or favorite author's highest quality stories barely get any recognition. I am too. Thus, the hate that he deserves for the plot/writing alone is colored by the hate he gets for being popular.

I've said this before, and I'll say it again: as far as I know, he's never been hateful towards the community and I was one of the many that got into HPFF via his fics. I won't say he's the cancer killing fanfiction because he's not. He's more like the McDonalds next door to a 4-star restaurant. All the kids go to the McDs and if they grow up or want some better food, they might head next door and find out just how bad the McDs was.

But, the thing some people need to realize is that there is a difference between disliking his plot and disliking him for writing them. His writing is shit, but he seems to be enjoying himself and he is, by virtue of being on the top view/reviews list all the time, is getting more people into the HPFF community. As far as I know, he's never been involved in any sort of drama/bullshit, so I have no problem with him personally. But too many people go out of their way to leave hateful reviews calling him names and whatnot, and that is wrong. If you don't like his writing, don't fuckin read it, and don't leave a shitty review.

Best short summation of this I ever read: "He's like Nickelback." which may actually have been one of your other analogies in a third, as yet unlinked, post now that I think about it.
