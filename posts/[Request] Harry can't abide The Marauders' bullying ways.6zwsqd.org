Pretty much what it says on the tin. I know canon Harry, despite being bullied and isolated by his cousin, was too fond of his parents and their memories' to really have any issues with James Potter bullying Snape for most of his Hogwarts career.

I want to see fics where Harry actually struggles to reconcile the image of his parents and godfather as kindly, loving people, who also treated someone like Malfoy and Dudley treated him - except worse, as they were a band of people ganging up on single targets. James and Sirius bullied Snape relentlessly from the very beginning. Sirius almost got him killed. They were a huge contributing factor in how Snape turned out, and no matter how foul and unlikeable he may be in the future, he didn't deserve it in his Hogwarts years. And Dumbledore did nothing consequential despite a student almost dying or being infected with lycanthropy, as it clearly did not change the Marauders' attitude towards Snape afterwards.

This post was inspired by the well-written fic linkffn(The Moment it Began), that has a dead person wake up as their younger self - Severus Snape, and all that he experienced in his later Hogwarts years. None of the characters are flat, or perfect. It's a good characterisation fic.


** Ok, you're painting one side of the story here. At the beginning, it's clear that the Marauders are rather arrogant, and do bully Snape. But it's become clear after some time that it's not one-sided.

Snape hangs out with some truly awful characters (see: Mulciber and Avery). There's a vague reference that Mulciber did something to Mary McDonald somewhere around their 4th year while Lily and Snape are still friends. There's also the fact that Snape is genuinely trying to find out Lupin's secret and then get him expelled or "outed". Not exactly an innocent victim.

Harry in canon seriously does struggle with what he sees in the pensieve. But, he also realizes that up to that point, he (along with the rest of the world) idealized his parents, partly for their sacrifice. I think he understands that his parents are flawed human beings, but in the end good people.

Why is James a good person? He harbors a friend after he gets kicked out of his own home. He goes out of his way to save Severus, at personal risk to himself. Note when Snape finds out about the prophecy, he's not concerned about saving James or Harry, simply Lily. While being a bit of a douche, it's clear that James has never gone out of his way to seriously harm a person. James sacrificed himself for his family. He learned how to be an Animagus, which is an extremely complicated piece of magic (there are 8 registered animagi in the 20th century), to help a friend.

And to finally answer your question. Yes, I think this is a case of "all roads lead to Rome" Bullied or not, Snape simply had too much bitterness and anger towards his father, his attitude towards magic, as well as muggles in general to not fall in. Maybe a stronger bond with Lily could have stopped it, but it's clear that the friendship was falling apart independent of any actions of that of James and the rest of the Marauders.

*** James would have turned out how he was regardless, though I do think being coupled with Sirius, who was worse, Remus, who was far too passive, and Wormtail, who went along with everything they did, simply amplified James' bad behavior. Snape on the other hand, I believe was a victim of circumstance.

I think even with the bullying from the Marauders, had Snape not been sorted into Slytherin, where every bitter part of his heart and mind were constantly nourished by that/those around him, he'd have ended up infinitely better.The sorting hat says it never makes a mistake, but I genuinely think it's a huge dick.

**** You're leaving out the fact that Snape wanted to go to Slytherin. He said so on the train ride. Above all, the sorting hat abides by choices (see: Potter, Harry).

Also note that Snape encourages Lily to be sorted into Slytherin while purposefully leaving out the prejudice she would face. Snape is incredibly selfish when it comes to his feelings for Lily, rarely thinking of her and what she would want or think.

***** To be fair, Snape may not have known about Slytherin's prejudice. He was brought up in a muggle setting and his only exposure to wizardry was through his socially ostracized pureblood mother that married an abusive muggle that hated magic.

He is selfish but when raised like him , you can understand why. But he lacks in the empathy department, which I assume is what you were talking about.

**** Yeah, Snape would've fallen in with the Death Eaters, because he was friends with them anyway, and grew to dislike any of the /mudbloods/ except Lily, who he had this super-weird obsessive crush on. He is not a sympathetic character, no matter how shitty the Marauders might've been to him, he is a bullying, racist arsehole who is only sort-of redeemed at the end because Dumbledore planned it all out.

Sirius' (at least I think it was Sirius?) throwaway comment of Snape always giving as good as he got is not necessarily untrue. Also, the constant bandying round of the werewolf incident is dumb. Snape could've manned up, ignored Sirius' baiting, but he wanted to find out where Lupin went to have something to use against the Marauders, and I reckon if he'd managed to observe without James coming and saving his life he'd have blabbed it all to the press and had Lupin executed or something. All of that could've been avoided if he wasn't /exactly/ as childish as Sirius.

He's a twat, just like young-Sirius is a twat, and in short I really don't like people pinning all his life choices on the Marauders. That's not how real life works. When it comes down to it, the choice is /always/, unless you literally have /no/ choice, with the individual.

***** Nope, I stay away from most disturbing fanfics. But I know enough about it.

Go ahead, try and defend it to me. Let me illustrate why it's disturbing.

The story starts out when Harry turns 12. Yes, you're correct in that there is no romantic inclination with either of them at this time, but that doesn't really matter. Snape is not only a teacher, as a teacher at a boarding school, he is a part-guardian of her during her most formative years as a young woman. Anytime relationships form where one person has power over the other, there should be questions asked. It's strenuous enough in the workplace with a superior dating one of his/her workers, it's a million times worse when it's a teacher and a student, especially when they essentially live in the same building.

There's a reason teacher/student relationships are looked upon badly by society, even when the student has graduated. It's not just because of the age difference, though that does obviously play a part, it's because someone with authority over someone else during their formative years should never allow those type of feelings to form, in them, or within their charge. It's not like Snape feels absolutely nothing romantic from 12-16, but as soon as Harry turns 17 it's like a switch is flipped and he falls in love. And even if (however unbelievable that may be) it does happen like that, do you really think that makes it OK?

The story has progressed from Harriet at 12 to 15 and there is no instance of Snape feeling anything for Harriet apart from protectiveness. I didn't recommend the sequel because it's getting shippy there for the reasons you mentioned, but there's nothing in the first part to imply Snape being a pedophile.
