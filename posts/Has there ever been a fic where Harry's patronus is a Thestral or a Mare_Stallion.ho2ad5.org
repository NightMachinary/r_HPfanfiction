Like the title suggests, I am wondering if those two options have ever been done, as those little ideas seem rather interesting.

Now, I am no expert on Patronus' so I don't know if gender has anything to do with what appears.

If there are any fics like that, please link them. Thank you for your time.


** Two fics that come to mind are linkffn(12516323) that it's being rewritten, linkffn(12155794) and I think that linkffn(12317784). In all of them he has a Thestral as a patronus

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

** In linkffn(13285012) Harry (well, Harleen, it is the fem!Harry story) has Thestral as a Patronus.

According to [[https://www.wizardingworld.com/news/discover-your-patronus-on-pottermore][the Pottermore]] “There are many forms that your Patronus could take; it could be a familiar animal or, in rarer cases, a magical creature.” In fact the only [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Patronus_Charm][patronus]] in the books which is not mundane animal is Dumbledore's phoenix, even Luna Lovegood, the hottest candidate for something non-mundane, got an ordinary hare.

  COMPLETE. The other children in class stared at the teacher. Then they stared at Harry, then back to the teacher, then at Harry, in a never-ending loop. Harry found he couldn't blame them.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

  Harry is struck with the killing curse and wakes up the day of the Last Task. This story will be the Order of The Phoenix if Harry had been a bit wiser and Luna a more present character. No time Paradox and no godmoding. Slow build up. Also, the tanslation in French is available by Eohwel.

** In terms of patronus and gender, remember in canon Snape's patronus is a doe. Now there have been a fic or two that I have read where depending on the depth of the bond between a couple their patronuses (patroni?) would match hence Jame's Stag and Lily's doe (eg natural mates).

Of course, those same authors then went to the shudder worthy story arc of if Snape really was in love with Lily shouldn't his patronus have been a stag (eg the mate of a doe). And since Snape's patronus was a doe did that mean that he really loved James hence his patronus doe. Remember there is a very fine line between Love and Hate. Thankfully those stories are few and far between.

For everyone else's patronus we don't really know what gender they are because we are never really told about coloration, etc of the animal the patronus takes the form of. And there are only a few animals where the sex is easy to determine by body type versus coloration etc (eg., lion, lioness, stag, doe, etc).

I always took Snape's patronus as an obsession rather than love, as it is exactly the same as Lily's presumably was, rather than being a complimentary animal.
