** Are there any that focus on a Harry-fem!Harry sibling type relationship? The scene in 0800 (Spoilers, kinda) where Iris (I think that was her name) bursts into his office with this desperation and hope that she actually has a family member always intrigued me. I thought there was a lot of potential there

*** I don't remember the name, but there was one where he kidnaps his mirror and takes her to St Mungus. It didn't seem like a romantic relationship on that one. Unfortunately, it was abandoned in like 5 or 10 chapters.

There is one called linkffn(Potter vs Paradox) where a 40yo femHarry goes back in time wanting to change shit, but ends up in a reality where she's a boy, and it seems like she'll play older sister/aunt to him. Only read the first few chapters so IDK where the story goes from there.

  The Girl-Who-Lived won; Magical Britain never recovered. As their world grows closer to another war, the surviving DA members concoct an elaborate plan that will see Iris Potter back in time to guide her younger self and prevent the war from ever happening. Fate however has other plans. GWL BWL, dark!Harry, timetravel, canon magic.

** linkffn(9704180)

Late 20's Harry from a alternate cannon end dystopia travels and is reborn as a fifteen year old teenager in a dimension featuring female Harry during the GOF. Features more than a few tropes, but at least it avoids the Lord Harry ones. So far Harry only consoles/mentors Ravenclaw femHarry in the encounters they have. It's supposed to be a harem fic in the end and I don't know how the author intends to handle the age difference issue. But from the way the characters are currently written, Harry/femHarry will probably not only be one of the outcomes but the in universe "special" relationship.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

*** Yeah, that's a really good fic, and we're all waiting for kathryn's update for quite some time now. I'm just glad that she doesn't abandon fics and eventually updates. This was actually one of the first fics I've read with the Flamels as a big part of the story, so it was quite new to me. I also liked the idea of Lords that Draco explains, I haven't seen this suggested anywhere else.

Thanks anyways.
