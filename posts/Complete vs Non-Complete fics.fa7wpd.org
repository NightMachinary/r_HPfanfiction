A friend called me out sometime back because I prefer to read complete fics over in-progress or abandoned ones. I think there are some fantastic fics out there that have been abandoned on a cliff hanger or just one it was starting to get good. After a few disappointments at the end I just started filtering by stories that are complete.

What about you? Which do you prefer?


** I think most people /prefer/ completed stories---I mean, unless the writer's ending is really rubbish, who /really/ wants to be left on an eternal cliffie if they've got another option?---but there are so many quality stories that aren't complete and are abandoned, or have very sporadic updates, that filtering by complete just seems...wasteful.

Sure, it's kind of disappointing to get to the end of the nth chapter and realise there's nothing to tie it all up, but I prefer reading up til that point rather than just not reading the fic at all. Never reading abandoned/incomplete fics is really very limiting---loads of fics I absolutely enjoy are abandoned, and they're still good/fun/entertaining reads even though the endings are incomplete. For example, Prince of the Dark Kingdom hasn't been updated in six years, but even so, it's over 1.2 million words (and over 6 complete 'books') of fantastical adventures and interesting worldbuilding that you just miss out on if you avoid all incomplete works.

*** I really wish authors would give an outline to where they were planning on taking the fic, if they are unable to finish it. I know they are writing for fun and they truly have no obligation to me or the other readers, but please!!!!

I once fell in love with a fic, only to get to the end and be devastated by the abrupt stop. I've also read to the end to see a lengthy author's note with a general summary of what didn't get written. The later is just so much more satisfying.

** I always prefer a complete story, but the reality is that that almost all of my favorite fics are incomplete. It's very hard to write a good story - it's even harder to end that story in a satisfying way, so there's just not that many good, complete stories out there, imo.

** From a writer perspective, having readers and hearing what people think motivates you to actually sit your ass down and complete the fic, so...

Give feedback on what you read, people! Good or bad! Somebody made an effort for free, it's the least you could do! (Barring things you read ironically because while reading things ironically is completely fine, mean spirited comments are not).

*** The problem is that I usually don't discover the stories until they are 1+ years old. Plus, I binged read. I don't have enough time to keep track of all the stories that are being written. I read so much fanfiction that if time goes by I literally don't remember which story updates go with.

So I almost exclusively binge read.

** My preference is for volume. I will prefer a 100,000 word incomplete fic to a 10,000 word complete one.

However, that is just an approximation. My preference is for volume of stuff, not volume of words. Some fics pack a lot more /stuff/ into 10,000 words than most fics do in 100,000.

That "stuff" can be worldbuilding, magic, character interactions, plot twists, moments of awesome, whatever. At the end of the day I read fanfiction to encounter interesting new HP ideas which capture my imagination.

Basically, so long as a fic has something meaty I can get my teeth into, I won't care if it's incomplete. And if it's a complete fic which is full of generic ideas, I will have zero interest in it.

** I read for the story-ideas, so I rarely end up reading completed fics...

while sometimes I end up frustrated, more often than not fics contain enough to satisfy me... I filter fics on Spacebattles/Sufficient Velocity by 20k+ Words, and on FFN it tends to be 40,60 or 100k+. Shorter fics i find through recommendations.

** If a story isn't completed then the most I'll read is the first few paragraphs to see if the author is at least literate. I'll bookmark it to read later if it looks OK.

I'm not going to waste my time reading incomplete stories which aren't likely to ever get completed.

This.

But even so, sometimes I have found so complete stories that have not been edited, mostly because the author's native language is not english. In such a case I just go through the reviews.

** Ohh definitely prefer completed ones. I'm always one of those people that love reading stuff in just one sitting and although there are great fics that are still in progress or have been abandoned, it kinda sucks not being able to complete it. It leaves a sort of incomplete feeling. I do however like to imagine the possible endings for those stories.

** Oh yes I agree with you. I never read incomplete or abandoned fics because it only leads to heartbreak and disappointment. In my experience, only a handful of incomplete fics that I wanted to read eventually were finished (in like 5 years I think). So I always filter stories by their state of completion.

*** Not unconditionally. If you think a fic's ending is rubbish, it would have been better left incomplete. IMO, at least.

There was a fic I liked a lot whose ending was basically to undo everything that happened in the fic. It ruined the fic for me and I'd have been far happier if the fic had been left incomplete up to that point.

** I think that non-complete works with decent writing can be just as captivating as complete ones. Abandoned stories are not something that bothers me too much and isn't even a term I filter by unless I'm looking for a trope I know to be overdone.

** I'll read in progress fics. However I greatly prefer completed fics. I rarely if ever read incomplete/abandoned fics because I just can't stand them.

I also have a thing about people putting fics on hiatus. If you put a fic on hiatus there's a 90% I will never read it or any of your other works again. About the only exception I make to that is if there's an author note that says the author is literally in hospital/death in the family/etc.

** Usually, complete fics are better than fics that end open-ended but is technically incomplete, which in turn is better than fics that leave loose ends, which in turn is better than fics that end on a cliffhanger.

The exception are fics whose ending can ruin the rest of the fic, but that is rather rare.

** A fic's completion status, has almost nothing to do with my choice to read it or not.

So I don't filter incomplete works out when searching, but I do approach incomplete fics, that are last updated 3+ years ago, and has less than 20K words, with more caution and make the call to read all of it or not much more swiftly. If their summary is not horrible, I still give them a chance, but if the first few paragraphs makes me think that, author couldn't have possibly managed to fit something worth reading, in 20K or so, I'll drop the story immediately. Usually before even reading the entire first chapter.

** I prefer completed. I feel the same frustration. You get 7-50 chapters in then nothing. I then check the date of the last chapter and it's obviously been abandoned for w/e reason. It's so frustrating. It feels like torture haha. Anyway, I look for those first. If I can't find any or if I have already read them then I'll check on not completed but only if they are long enough. I stay away from one shots bc i want to have the idea fleshed out. Usually oneshots are too shallow.

** While I tend to prefer completed fics, I don't limit myself to them. For one, I've found that not all completed fics are marked as complete in the header, and some that are marked complete either stop abruptly or the author says, “look for the sequel” at a point I'd consider a chapter break.

For another, some incomplete fics merely update very slowly, and it can be hard to determine which category a story falls into.

Finally, as others have said, some incomplete stories are full of wonderful ideas and writing.

** I really prefer completed stories and filter for them but if I am searching for a particular (rare) trope or get a rec I also read WIPs. Currently I have a few WIPs that I follow but updates have really slowed down by all of them though since I am also a fic writer I think it's very important for the writers if you read WIPs and give feedback because it really helps with writing and it motivates
