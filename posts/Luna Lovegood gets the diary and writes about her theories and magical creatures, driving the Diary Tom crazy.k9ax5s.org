  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. Plot takes a while to appear but it's there) See last chapter for fan art and translations.

*** This fanfic is crazy good, and I especially like that while Tom and Luna eventually get around a quasifriendship, she is wise to his tricks and rubs circles around him without losing any of her Luna-escence
