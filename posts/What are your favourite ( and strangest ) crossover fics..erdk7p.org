** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12076771/1/][Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water]]

Voldemort's last Horcrux on the bottom of the ocean merges with the spirits of the dead sailors on the sunken German battleship Bismarck, and the result is a very evil magic ship that attacks London with magical WW2 era weapons. But the Bismarck was not the only ship that awakened: The British battlecruiser Hood teams up with Harry, Ron and Hermione to defend the country from the threat at sea.

** linkffn(The Queen Who Fell to Earth) is a fantastic Dragonriders of Pern crossover series.

linkffn(The Denarian Renegade) is a pretty good introduction to the Dresden Files (by Jim Butcher - an amazing paranormal series) and it's quite enjoyable.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20) is a D&D OC appearing in the HP world. And not just any D&D character, a bloody wizard.

linkffn(Swords and Sorcery: No Route Back) is more of a Fate/ fic, but still takes place in the HP world, albeit with a few changes. Pretty enjoyable if you also know Fate.

linkffn(Strength of Brothers) this one's a Naruto crossover where Harry and Naruto have a connection from birth and can talk to each other.

linkffn(Mystic Knight Online) is an SAO cross where Harry is just a bit more sarcastic than usual. Features the regular cast of SAO as well as a few from other SAO properties.

linkffn(In All Things Balance) is a Star Wars Legends crossover where Darth Nox takes in and trains Harry to be grey and then stop the Empire.

** It's not particularly strange, but linkffn(A Study in Magic) is a decent (and long) crossover with Sherlock (BBC series set in the 21st century, not the original). One of Moriarty's plans resulted in the Dursleys' deaths; Sherlock and (female) John adopted Harry.

Strengths include Sherlock being brilliant but obnoxious, John being a flawed but caring mother figure to Harry. Weaknesses include sticking a bit closely to the stations of canon (there are some interesting subversions, though).

** Well, there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3991385/1/Sherlock-Holmes-and-the-Ravenclaw-Codex][Sherlock Holmes and the Ravenclaw Codex]].

There are plenty of HP/Sherlock crossovers, but this is a crossover with the ORIGINAL (and best) Sherlock Holmes, of Victorian times, and takes place long before Harry, or even Dumbledore, were born... most of the wizards are OCs, some of them clear ancestors of canon characters, like "Professor Weaselby" is clearly related to the Weasleys, and "Goyle the Groundskeeper" is... well, a Goyle. We do get Phineas Nigellus Black as the Headmaster of Hogwarts and Professor Binns from before he became a ghost.

Sherlock Holmes is as Muggle as they come in this story, but the knows about the wizarding world and does NOT like it... for reasons explained in the fic itself. It's written in an approximation of Conan Doyle's style, with Watson as the first person narrator and everything. Some of the dialogue between Holmes and Watson are really inspired... Watson, when first learning about Hogwarts, is less than impressed because he thinks it's a school for "fakirs and conjurers."

*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13243910/1/The-Room-with-a-Computer][The Room With The Computer]] is an old fic, it was written before DH was even released, and it's not very action-packed, but it's really well written. It's a crossover with the X-Men movieverse, and mainly focuses on Scott Summers, after the death of Jean, taking the post of Muggle Studies teacher at Hogwarts. Other X-Men show up in smaller roles or cameos, but mostly it's Scott at Hogwarts.

The beauty of the fic lies in the small details and subtle worldbuilding, creating a worls where you really do believe that HP and the X-Men COULD share a universe. There's a bit of tension between wizards and mutants in this universe, with many wizards dismissing mutants as "one trick ponies," hence they largely stay out of each other's way. (Dumbledore is of course an exception here, being a good friend of Xavier.)

Definite highlight of the fic, though? Arthur Weasley gets a ride in the X-Jet.

*

From the X-movieverse to the MCU: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11230962/1/Son-of-the-Archer][Son of the Archer]] and its sequels is a crossover with the Avengers movies. The writing quality here isn't QUITE as good as the others, but the story's fun and engaging. It's another "raised by crossover characters" fic, but in this case it's not HARRY who gets the different upbringing, it's RON. Kidnapped by Death Eaters as a toddler and rescued by Clint "Hawkeye" Barton, Ron ends up being raised by Clint when nobody can find his real family. Later in the story, when the wizarding world finds Ron, there's a custody battle between Hawkeye and the Weasleys... thankfully neither part is villainized; both sides genuinely want what's best for Ron but have different ideas about what the best for him IS.

Harry (whose life is exactly as in canon) doesn't appear until the second story, when the Hogwarts years start, but both Hermione and Neville end up having thei early lives changed and play notable roles in the story... in this universe, Bellatrix got involved in the Ron-napping and was injured by Clint, and so she wasn't as her top game when going to torture the Longbottoms, which meant that while Frank still ended up incapacitated, Alice managed to escape being tortured and so Neville grew up with his mother. As for Hermione... she gets involved a different way.

Hawkeye is the "main" Avenger character, but the others have decent roles too, especially Black Widow, Bruce Banner and "Uncle" Nick Fury... also Tony Stark, who tends to steal every scene he's in.

What I really like about this is that sure, Ron grows up on the SHIELD helicarrier and is on first-name basis with superheroes and gets to know all sorts of interesting secrets and cool tech, the fic doesn't turn him into a miniature SHIELD agent who's more badass than five adults. He's still a kid, and when disaster strikes, SHIELD and Avengers don't go "Get them, Ron!" but "Someone get the kid to safety!!"

*

Finally, there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13067729/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Hourwick-of-Oz][Harry Potter and the Hourwick of Oz,]], which is a crossover with the Land of Oz. I DON'T mean the Wizard of Oz movie; this is NOT a story about Harry fainting and re-enacting the movie plot with other HP characters in the roles of Scarecrow, Lion and such... it's a crossover with the original Oz books where Oz is very much NOT a dream.

In this story, some time after the war with Voldemort, wizards are starting to lose their magic. One by one, more and more wizards simply lose their magic and effectively become Squibs. Harry and friends try to figure out what's going on and why... first they find out that house-elves are somehow involved, and then that everything is somehow linked to Ozma, the queen of Oz.

The bulk of the story is about a group of familiar characters -- Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Luna, Neville, Hagrid and Kreacher -- journeying to the land of Oz, enciuntering lots of characters from the Oz books like Tik-Tok, the Nome King, and King Rinkitink... and then all the trials and adventures they have trying to find and talk to Ozma. They end up discovering just how deeply linked Oz and the wizarding world is, and uncover a rather shocking truth about the wizarding world.

It's an interesting story where everyone gets to do something. The most important Oz characters that people who haven't read the books might recognize are probably Ozma and the Wizard, but the Scarecrow, Tin Woodman and Glinda have good roles as well, and people like Dorothy and Jack Pumpkinhead make appearances.

I'm not 100% sure how much sense the story will make to someone who hasn't ead the Oz books, but the fic does try to get the reader up to speed by having the fic presented from the POV of the HP characters, who don't know much about Oz themselves.

The exception is Ginny, who read the books when she was young... but that's a tradidion of the Oz books, because L. Frank Baum wrote the books as if Oz was a real place and he was just retelling storues that Dorothy had told him... hence it wasn't unusual in the later Oz books to have someone new visit Oz and knowing about it because they read the previous books. Hence, Ginny often takes the role of exposition when she explains things to the others... although sometimes she remembers things wrong or it turns out the books weren't 100% accurate.

I really like the role the story gives to Hagrid. Hagrid's so often forgotten about in fanfics, but here he's right in the thick of things... even if the author can't write his accent worth beans, he still befriends dangerous animals and at one point leads an expedition into the Forbidden Forest, so he's definitely Hagrid.
