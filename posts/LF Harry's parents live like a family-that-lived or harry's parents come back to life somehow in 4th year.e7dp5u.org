I've been reading a fanfiction with that idea, and I loved the prompt and the H/Hr shipping but I hate the entire direction the author takes. He, and I have to assume it's a he because the writing reeks of unconscious sexism, goes into lordships and politics and OPHarry but so terribly I just can't continue it. I really don't wanna bash an ff so I won't mention which fic it is. I want an ff where Harry has or gets his parents around3rd or 4th year so we can skip rehashing the first few years of kid harry.
