  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." (fifth year, characterdevelopment!Harry, free!Sirius, competent!Ministry, much queerness)

**** Agreed, though it's not exactly a high bar :p

Ironically I wish it was more focused on the sex change. In many ways it's a standard hurt/comfort angst fic. Harry has been retconned to be significantly more emotionally damaged by his time at the Dursleys and the focus of the story is mostly on dealing with the psychological fallout of that.

The sex change stuff is used mostly as a vehicle for that rather than as a plot in itself and as such it's quite frustrating for a reader who is primarily interested in the sex change storyline. Many of what would be the most interesting scenes are rather derailed by emotional breakdowns.

** “Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool” has that happen. However, it also has some ... potentially off-putting things at the beginning, and it's more of a “Harry comes back in time, ends up being thrown into a female body” so it's anyone's guess whether or not it counts. Due to those reasons I have not linked the story, but I can do that if you want and it's not exactly hard to find anyway (no stories with the same title, as far as I know).

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9928419/1/][*Season of Change*]] linkffn(9928419) is probably the best out of this sort of story that I've read. It's a shame that it appears to have been abandoned as it was decently good.

  There were only a few things in Harry Potter's life that were absolutes. He was the son of Lily and James Potter and that he was born male. What happens when he discovers the truth. AU Strong/Independent, Gender-Switch, Fem!Harry, Fem!Slash Mature Themes

** my fic wrote the first chapter like a year ago an recently started working on the second one and also rewriting parts of the the first [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11008068/1/The-Shift]]

the feeling i want to give with it is that of the manga Kanojo ni Haru hi: Another so no harry who instantly becomes ok with acting like a girl. and the story isn't ceraintly a excuse to pair him with a male character.
