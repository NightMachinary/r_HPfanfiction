Here's a prompt: A muggleborn who's an avid video game fan causes shenanigans after trying to cast something they saw from an RPG.

For example:

After being bestowed with a wand, Norman Invidia, an avid fan of the Bayonetta series begins chanting his idol's signature chant. He's practically memorized it after playing through the ending several times.

"Teloc Vovim, A Graa Ors, Tabaord, Avavago"

A bolt of multicolored light shoots out from his wand. The light curves back towards him, and his hair grows to ridiculous lengths.

The long, tangled mass twists further into itself before turning into an out-of-control beast and rampages in Ollivander's wand shop.

"At least one every year," the aging wandmaker sighs.


** This would have to take place during the new generation or right before because Bayonetta released on 2009.

Edit: I feel bad I completely derailed this post to point out what students could reference what video game. This story idea does sound pretty interesting.

*** Most likely sometime after. Maybe 2010-ish, so the fandom has time to get established.

**** Considering Teddy Lupin, who I am designating as the first member of the new generation, started Hogwarts in 2009, right after sounds good.

Also muggleborns must be heartbroken when they realize there is no electricity at Hogwarts to play video games or watch TV.

They also don't have reddit to distract themselves from homework.

****** Forget reddit, these poor souls can't access the internet at all.

Clearly muggleborns stopped going to Hogwarts in the 2000's and 2010's because of the lack of elctronics. In fact, I'm amazed they went in the 1980's and 1990's.

******** And then they died out because Genetics. Or the muggleborns used technology to take over the wizarding government because Voldemort showed that it wasn't /that/ hard.

******** As well as TV and radio. And most other electronics.

Obviously Tesla and Edison were pureblood wizards trying to stop muggleborns from entering any wizarding school in the world. It just took a while.

  The summer before his fifth year, Harry obtains a computer and an internet connection. Two months later, he emerges a changed person, for what has been seen cannot be unseen. AU with the whole Harry Potter timeline moved forward to the modern day. References to internet memes, video games, anime, etc.
