If he were provided access to it.


** One of my favorite stories that follow this plot line is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24476011/chapters/59074657][Ouroboros]], in which he raises himself.

*** Ugh it's "raise" as in "raise a child", not "raise" as in "raise from the dead".

I thought this was a fic where Voldemort does the resurrection ritual himself through use of a time turner, but no dice. Guess I should have expected it, honestly, this fandom doesn't tend to spit out actually interesting or unique stories.

** Travel back in time and convince 15 year old Tom Riddle to never adopt the name Lord Voldemort because it's the concoction of an edgy teenager and it sounds quite stupid to call yourself that when you're in your seventies.

** Depending on how willing he is to disregard the rule against seeing yourself, and how fixed time is in the HP universe, he could potentially loop back a few times whenever it would be convenient to have five of himself at once, for instance whenever Dumbledore shows up.

*** Can he though? Time turners don't actually change the past. Everything that you do with a time turner already happened. That's how Harry saved himself and didn't just straight up die to the Dementors.

** He could use it to attack multiple places at once during the war. So it would seem like he is everywhere at once.
