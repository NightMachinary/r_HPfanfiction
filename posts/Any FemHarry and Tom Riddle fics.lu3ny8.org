I've just been reading Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus and I really like the premise but it's way too long for me and it looks like Lily is going to be a child for a hundred years.

I was hoping for something that focuses on more on the FemHarry x Tom pairing and how fucked it up is because they're meant to be mortal enemies.

  When the battle in the department of mysteries heads south, Harry finds herself flung backwards in time to 1942, where Tom Riddle is a prefect in his fifth year. Armed with this knowledge, but little else, Harry desperately tries to find a way home and for once in her life not screw it up. Tom, for his own part, wonders when Harry Evans will head back to the mothership.

** Oooooh I HAVE to recommend this one. Linkao3(The Historical Importance of Runic War Warding in the British Isles by Samvelg). It is an amazing fic, unfortunately unfinished but if Samvelg continues it will be amazing.

Edit: ah... i just saw Fem!Harry X Tom Riddle pairing and threw it out there. Not sure if it's quite what you are looking for but read it anyway! ðŸ˜‚

  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.[ON TEMPORARY HIATUS FOR PERSONAL REASONS, NOT ABANDONED â™¡]
