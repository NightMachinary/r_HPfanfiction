I've always loved Hermione in the books. She's logical and a bookworm, can be hard-edged when it comes to idiots and dumb questions. When people fuck with her friends, she can be downright vicious (if not ruthless). See Rita Skeeter, and the fact Hermione kept her IN A FUCKING JAR and THREATENED HER to write a completely truthful article which was published in the Quibbler.

But for the sake of writing fanfiction... I'm curious to know how others see Hermione. Movie Hermione was a lot more sentimental and soft in my opinion, while Book Hermione was a reasonably mature young academic on the road to success capable of being pretty damn dangerous when inclined. Just how ruthless do you think Hermione could be? Where is her moral limit, if she really actually has one? (it has been argued to me that if you could persuade her with logic, she'd agree to anything proposed, but that seems like a Slytherin!Hermione AU than anything.)


** Given how much of a bookworm she is, I would say that she is full of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11388837/1/Adorable-Violence][Adorable Violence]].

** The Green Girl shows a Slytherin Hermione that becomes pretty vengeful and vicious when needed.

And for pure efficient brutality, the Hermione in the Arithmancer comes up with some nasty spells

Both are good characterizations of how Hermione might have acted in different situations.

**** I disagree, it's just not a single point of departure fic. It's an AU where the attitudes of the Slytherins is different than in canon. Making them something more than one dimensional bigoted bastards.

I can understand thinking that the Slytherins accepting Hermione despite being Muggleborn can seem like a bad start to a story if you want to stick with the exact characterization of Malfoy and Co as written in canon, but if they are going to be supporting main characters its refreshing to tweak things a bit.

** My best reading of Hermione is as a situational deontologist who believes in proportional vengeance. Brewing an illegal potion is Bad, unless it can prevent the Worse outcome of muggleborn students being harmed. Going behind Harry's back about the broom is Bad, unless it can prevent the Worse outcome of Harry dying. Enforcing her will on the Hogwarts' house elves is Bad, unless it can prevent the Worse outcome of their continued slavery. Keeping a person in a jar and blackmailing them would be Bad, except Skeeter had already done proportionally Bad things by libeling a teenager in a national newspaper. Sneaking permanent disfiguration into a magical contract would be Bad, unless the clause only activates if the signees act proportionally Bad by turning in the DA to Umbridge. Erasing her parents' memories would be Bad, except their capture by Voldemort would lead to a Worse outcome. She also makes exceptions in her morality for people she loves, like cheating to help Ron onto the Quidditch team.

Where does that leave her moral limits? She wouldn't harm innocents, and she would have serious issues with sacrificing people for Greater Good-reasons, because she isn't a consequentialist. I could, on the other hand, see her going /very/ far to protect Ron and Harry, and woe betide anyone who harms them significantly.

She's at the same time the member of the trio who thinks the most about morality, and the most morally complex member, which makes her really interesting. Harry is simple -- he's Virtuous so long as he doesn't commit Evil, and although he fights evil and helps others, he does so out of kindness and not out of moral obligation. Ron mostly takes moral cues from Harry and Hermione and by himself is a bit amoral, what with him playing Quidditch while thinking he is under the influence of a performance enhancing drug, or confounding his driving instructor to be allowed onto the roads despite being judged a potential danger to other road users. He's more like fanfiction sometimes portrays Sirius, caring more about family than about morality. I could see Hermione and Ron mutually pushing each other to do some pretty horrendous things to avenge Harry, if someone killed him -- I don't think much would be off limits for either of them, in that specific scenario.

** Given her intelligence, her unwavering dedication to learning absolutely everything about magic, and her trauma after the war. Id say Bellatrix level of ruthlessness (without the sadistic joy)when needed.

** If the war dragged on longer or if she was more exposed to the atrocities, I can easily see her going full vigilante, either during or immediately after the war when the justice system fails as it does in canon.

Her moral limit are certainly the innocent, but her definition might be a bit narrower than the average person's.

*** I had similar thoughts? It's probably why the Slytherin!Hermione AU is such an interesting one, because she has SUCH a capacity for being cunning, ruthless, and strategic in the way Slytherins are famous for. No need to be "Evil dark" but definitely "questionable dark grey" witch who could very well topple governments if she actually had the motivation.

** "movie hermione was more sentimental and soft" oh, so punching malfoy in the face, and helping harry leave umbridge to get dragged off by centaurs is soft?

*** You want my honest opinion? Yes. She could have done so much more to Malfoy in that moment. She had her wand pointed at his throat and he was defenceless. She could have cursed him or such with a nasty spell or could have simply cut his throat and kill him right here and there, but she choose to punch him instead. And Hermione was leading Umbridge to Grawp, not the centaurs. She probably thought he'd grab her (Umbridge) or be able to defend her and Harry with his strength and magic resistance. And to be fair, Harry was going to be put under the Cruciatus Curse and Umbridge asked for answers no one had.

**** for the malfoy thing, there is a difference between hard, and a murderer, malfoy hadn't done anything too bad at that point (being only third year) but killing a 13 year old kid would see her in azkaban if lucius had his way

** Hermione, if properly cultivated, could be the deadliest thing in Wizarding Britain by age 30. If she'd gotten Minister rather than Kingsley, we'd've ended up with her becoming a mix between Nucky from Boardwalk Empire and Lex Luthor from Superman, with a dash of Reddington from The Blacklist. Like a Bond Villain who'd actually read the Evil Overlord list.
