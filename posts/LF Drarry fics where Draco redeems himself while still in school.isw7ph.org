Fics like "Survival is a talent" where he starts out as his normal asshole self, but he gradually becomes a good person. Preferably a good, gay person who then gets together with Harry.


** Definitely check out [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214][the secret language of plants]]! The first one is pre-Hogwarts but Draco is a very important character later.

  It was "Witch Weekly", of all people and organizations, the first to notice and comment on The Boy Who Lived's absence from the ranks of first years at Hogwarts. The magazine went on to elucubrate that the young hero was studying at a foreign school, possibly Beauxbatons or Holzschuhk√§se.
