Hey guys, I have been writing fanfiction for acouple of years now, but never Had a beta- and well, my stuff shows...

Anyway, after a break of six months i signed up for a dramione fest just to force myself to write again and I do need a Beta. The text Will be around 10.000 words i imagine and it is about a magical Ice age...

Anyone interested in helping?

*** Oh thank you, I believe I found someone interested in Dramione, BUT I do have another project I am in need of a Beta too- it is like " Andromeda Tonks saves Westeros". Do you like ASOIAF - Harry Potter crossovers?

**** Thanks for the offer but I'm not particularly knowledgeable about the ASOIAF universe so I'm afraid I wouldn't be much help with that one!

**** I'm a huge fan of both the Harry Potter universe and GoT if you're still looking! I would love to help you with your story. In the real world I work as an editor.
