There are a lot of OP Harry fics out there, what surprises me about them is that he's rarely respected despite all of his power. He could show up with wandless magic in his first year and Draco would still antagonize him. I want to see a fic where Harry actually gets a say in the war ( Dumbledore respects him enough that he informs him of stuff to find solutions together ) and the tension doesn't come from mindless squabbles with Snape, Draco, Ron and Dumbledore but from Voldemort, who is a big threat even when Harry is extremely competent for his age. So Molly doesn't try to order him around, the minister and Skeeter wouldn't dare to start a hate campaign against him since everyone knows he, Dumbledore and Voldemort are on another level. The aurors would follow his orders, because you don't say no to Harry Potter.

** Yeah, funny how fanfic authors keep trying to mash two opposing ideas together like that - the power fantasy, and still keeping Harry as an underdog hero. It just doesn't work and makes no sense.

*** It's mainly because, if you're respected for your power, there's not much more thrill to becoming more powerful, like, who cares if your stunner can break through a protego maxima, vs two protego maximas, if they're so scared of your power they don't bother to fight.

By keeping people disrespectful, while still powerful, it lets you get more of that great schadenfruede feeling of putting someone who underestimated you in their place.

*** majority of fanfics always seems to ignore the idea of ' You can't *have* your *cake and eat it* '

They love to write in stuff that changes everything or has effects on the story or characters, but they... tend to ignore those changes to the story and characters.

*** What good is raw power against decades of experience and knowledge? It actually makes more sense to me for Harry to be able to match Voldemort on a purely magical level (marked as his equal etc) but struggle against Voldemort when it comes to how that power can be used. Voldemort has, on top of a completed Hogwarts education, decades of studies covering powerful, obscure, illegal types of magic, not to mention an abundance of political resources in a broken system he can meld to his benefit. Canon Harry wins because he has access to Dumbledore's info, Voldemort's mind, and ultimately, finding a piece of lore so obscure that not even Voldemort has bothered/managed to study it in its entirety. I like the idea of the adults actually seeing Harry's power, realizing that he, like all children, needs a healthy and stimulating environment in which he can grow to embrace his full potential, and treat him as their (future) equal instead of just coddling him and keeping him in the dark.

Honestly? Quite a bit. If you're three times stronger than your opponent, tricks and guile don't matter all that much. You power right through anything they do. (See Bolo's (Chong Li) fights in Bloodsport.)

"Oh, you're good at dodging and invisibility? I'll just set the entire acre on fire; you'll burn wherever you run to."

"Ah, I see you like to strike from behind. But my shield goes all the way around and reflects attacks from any direction, so I don't care which side you come from."

"Well, look at that, you know some advanced spells, but while I brush off those flee-bites I'm turning your whole body to juice via sheer blunt force trauma."

Sure, Voldemort is dangerous to most everyone because he has both power AND experience over theirs, but if he came up against someone with triple his power and none of his experience he'd still die like a chump.

Granted, most OP Harry don't make him THAT powerful because what's the point of writing that?

**** This is partly what I tried to convey in my story. My Harry does very well against monsters/beasts, but when he comes up against other humans, humanoids, he often struggles, despite being very powerful.

Mainly, it's because he is, more often than not, fighting against individuals with much greater experience and knowledge. He also struggles with his own morality, but does eventually become more ruthless.

Some people complained that my Harry didn't kill his enemies at first. It's a completely valid criticism, but I kind of based my earlier Harry on Peter Parker, and Clark Kent, so him ruthlessly killing any Death Eater he sees, doesn't make much sense.

My Harry is a very kind person, so I wanted him to struggle with the idea of wilfully ending another person's life. An event happened which pushed him over the edge, and he has since added Oliver Queen and Bruce Wayne to his character profile.

  A month after Dumbledore's death, Harry is depressed and wallowing in grief at Privet Drive. One night, shortly before his seventeenth birthday, Fawkes appears in his room, and whisks him away to a hidden stronghold. There, our hero meets the spirit of Godric Gryffindor, who takes Harry as his apprentice. Harry/Multi. Powerful, not godlike. Intelligent Harry. Ch 2 is NOT missing.

*** The problem with OP Harry who everyone knows is OP and treats him as such is... it's not a school fic. There's no reason for him to go to school to learn Lumos when he can already go toe to snout with dragons and win. So since it's not about him at school, you instead have an eleven-year-old trying to keep up with a hundred-and-eleven-year-old in politics and strategy, and he has no friends, and all the other characters basically don't exist. There's no story any more.

***** HPMOR does indeed spend quite a bit of its earlier chapters billing itself as a science-centric story, but it by far spend more of it's runtime dealing w/ themes about rationality than themes about science. Of/c, this is belied by Less Wrong's heavily flawed and pockmarked understanding of rationality, so large tracts of HPMOR's commentary on rationality just don't work. Ironically, HPMOR's strongest aspect is emotional storytelling and the character development of several of its main characters.

I am puzzled by [[/u/lkc159][u/lkc159]] bringing up HPMOR up w/r/t a a fanonical competent Ministry---if anything, HPMOR's Ministry is, both diegetically and non-diegetically, ridiculously /in/competent.

Yes, the Ministry doesn't feature /heavily/ in HPMOR, but what little there is suggests extreme incompetence. Eg, ^{⟨spoilers for the finale of HPMOR⟩}being so bloated that it employs three-quarters of magical Britain's adult population and ^{⟨spoilers for the finale of HPMOR⟩}being unable to mount a meaningful resistance to the Death Eaters even after Voldemort purged the Ministry's ranks of incompetents for seven months.
