I've found two fics like the title says and now I'm looking all around for similar ones.

I'm looking for AU with two Harry Potter's coexisting at the same time. Alive! Potters are a bonus. Add me a Snape in there somewhere and I'll be in fanfic-heaven. It can be slash, it can be gen. All recs are much appreciated

The ones I've found so far:

Somethings do by Tricota AU With a blast of magic Harry gets thrown into another dimension where his parents are alive and Neville is the bow who lived. In a world where nothing is the same, Harry finds himself gravitating toward Snape as the only fixed point across dimensions: every Snape in every reality always hates Harry Potter. Somethings never change.

Too far from home by story2tell Transported into a parallel universe, Harry finds himself in the shadow of an evil growing force. Amidst old and new faces and the chance for a family that he never had, Harry must come to the terms that although there are two worlds, there can only be one hero.

And one that kind of fits but doesn't really but I loved it so here you have me reccing it: Escaping the Paradox by mery After Harry is thrown back in time to 1971, he has several choices to make (Snarry)


** Linkao3(C'est La Vie by cwyscross) has Harry transported to another dimension where a very James-Potter-esque Harry Potter already exists. Linkffn(Elsewhere but not Elsewhen) has two Harry Potters, but they get along just fine

  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

  Thestrals can go a lot more places than just wherever you need to go. Unfortunately for Harry Potter, Voldemort is more than aware of this, and doesn't want to deal with Harry Potter anymore.

** Damn, I knew I read something like this but can't for the love of me remember... All that I recall are older Harry meeting a younger Harry...

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8446057/chapters/19350271]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4167129/chapters/9406038]] are two such that stand out to me, and the second one does have Snape xD.

  A trap during the Horcrux hunt sends Harry into a dimension where war has raged for 28 years. Harry must not only protect himself from Voldemort, but also from a rising new Dark Lord, the evil Ministry, a war-hardened Dumbledore... and himself. Will he find his way back home to finish his own war? COMPLETE.

** Haha, two Harrys? You may like mine!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13125917/1/Trading-Places][Trading Places]]

When a devastating attack on Hogwarts causes Harry to switch places with his on-screen counterpart, Daniyel Bluelake, Harry is thrown into an unfamiliar Muggle world where his life is just a fantasy. His job? Acting. Meanwhile, Daniyel will discover what it truly means to be a wizard as he learns to separate the magical fantasy world he's always known from its dark reality. But with Voldemort intent on Harry's murder, Dan's happy days at Hogwarts are certainly numbered, and a showdown with Voldemort seems inevitable. But what can Dan do, in Harry's place? And how high will the cost be... to switch them back?

â€‹

Not exactly two Harrys, but kind of. :)

*** Strange Reflections was so cartoonish. The characters might as well have been twirling their evil moustache. It was beyond unrealistic behavior at that point.

**** Over-the-top cartoonishness of the Potters from the alternate dimension could have been enjoyable in so-bad-it's-good sort of way or as a parody of all those tropes you usually see in WBWL genre if the fic hadn't constantly cut to Harry having PTSD flashbacks about Muggleborn concentration camps. It's like there are two completely tonally different fics thrown together here, and neither works because of that.
