I've seen several fics mention that every time Voldemort makes a horcrux he sacrifices half of his soul meaning that by the time of the main story he only has 1/128 of his soul in his actual body. I always got the impression that each horcrux was just a small slither of his soul which had been splintered by the act of murder. From what I can tell it's just people taking "split" to mean cut into even halves rather than just cutting into two pieces of indeterminate size. But it did make me curious so I thought I would ask.


** No. Slughorn, in his explanation uses 'part,' 'portion,' and 'pieces.'

I think people have been tripped up by Dumbledore saying 'tear his soul in two.'

*** Indeed. Personally I doubt that the soul is quantifiable in such a way that you could take percentages of it. But if it were, I would imagine each horcrux to be a tiny fragment.

*** Dumbledore's whole philosophy and attitude is molded by the guilt and emotional trauma he carries with him because of his sister. Readers should take what he says with a huge pinch of salt. He isn't an objective narrator, he is a character with his own life experiences and interpretations.

** There's /no/ canon evidence for it, and a fair bit against it: Slughorn's exact words are:

#+begin_quote
  Well, you understand that the soul is supposed to remain intact and whole. Splitting it is an act of violation, it is against nature.
#+end_quote

And:

#+begin_quote
  Killing rips the soul apart. The wizard intent on creating a Horcux would use the damage to his advantage: he would encase the torn portion-
#+end_quote

(Riddle then interrupts him.)

On top of that, Voldemort's soul was eventually so badly damaged that a chunk of it just broke off accidentally, which is how Harry became a horcux. As I recently said in another thread: I don't care if it's anybody's /headcanon./ I think it's stupid, and I'm pretty quick to say as much, but I don't actually care. I do, however, care when people present it as being /actual/ canon, or, worse yet, presuppose it to be so.

As for its origins, I couldn't tell you: I believe it was popularised by [[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mbC-sDMHypU][this]] video, but the idea existed before Mat Pat codified it. The first place I ever saw it was in a handy little infographic on tumblr that I can't seem to find.

** My headcanon is that soul, an immaterial thing, does not have size that could be measured. The creation of a Horcrux is not comparable to slicing pieces of bread, but rather the fission of a cell. Both parts are entirely functional and complete copies of one another at the beginning, but then they grow apart. However, the act of cold-blooded murder damages the soul, causing insanity, emotional instability, cruelty, and psychopathy. That damage can only be healed with merging the soul fragments together with genuine remorse.

Also, to me it seems sensible that even if there was a way of measuring the size of souls, not one soul would have a constant, fixed size. Experiences affect the size of a soul. Hermione's character arch is a fine example of this. In PS she is obsessed with rules and generally quite a nitpicky person, but in DH she breaks into a bank for the greater good. Her soul had developed throughout the series.

** If soul have a size, then you're better off making putting as little of your soul as possible in any given horcrux. Maybe that's why Voldy was able to accomplish the unprecedented and make 7 of them, he still kept most of his soul in his body and put less than a twelfth in each horcrux.

** The split I think is not total, the Horcruxes still have connections to one another, or at least to the original, as seen by Harry's scar allowing him to see what Voldemort is doing and vice versa, and the whole possessing nagini thing.

** Up until Tom came along dark wizards were only making a single horcrux, so splitting their soul in halves would make sense. But this guy was planning to make seven from the get go, he wasn't making Horcruxes on a whim. It's entirely plausible that he split a 7th of his soul each time, since he has that much foresight.

** My headcanon is that Tom messed up on his first horcrux (the diary) and put too much of his soul in. This is why it showed more autonomy than the others. After that he was careful to put a small sliver of his soul in his other horcruxes.
