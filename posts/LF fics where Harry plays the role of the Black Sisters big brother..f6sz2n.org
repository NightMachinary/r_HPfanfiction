Looking for time travel fics where Harry is like a big brother to Narcissa, Andromeda and Bellatrix. Maybe Harry claims to be a long lost Black or is just a friend of the family. Thanks!

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)

**** They handle it in a way that isn't creepy or cliche fan fiction-y. The character essentially undergoes a potion/transfiguration medical procedure. It's not an accident, it's very much like a normal pregnancy other than magic being necessary. It's handled not unlike the way a trans person might experience gender. It even goes on to discuss gender dysphoria and the wizards extreme feelings about his body during the pregnancy. It still might not be your thing, but don't let that be the part that causes you to discount the entire fic if you're more on the fence about mpreg

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

Cassiopeia sort of counts, Casssiopeia Black is sort of an older sister figure to all the younger Blacks she's the older sister of Sirius and Regulus but is really protective of the Black Sisters as well. So not Harry but honestly if the author later reveals that Cassiopeia in this fic is a reincarnation of Harry the whole time I won't be the least bit surprised.
