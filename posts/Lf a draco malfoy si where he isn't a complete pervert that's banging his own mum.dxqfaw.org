** A fanfiction reader is stuck as Draco Malfoy.

He steals as much money from his family's vault as possible, leaves Dumbledore an anonymous note with Horcrux locations, moves to America and watches from far away as the civil war wrecks magical Britain.

Meanwhile the SI in Harry Potter curses his fate of being stuck as the main character.

*** I tend to think of HP as some sort of King Arthur type, and so just flat -unable- to leave the isles.

Draco, no such impediment. And yeah, why not go to USA if you are rich and skip all the killing and danger? (Not to mention the Draco-were theory; no real benefit in sucking up to a psycho.)

*** There's 40 on AO3, almost all smut. Probably no more than a hundred on FFN and elsewhere, unless there's a secret archive of Draco/Narcissa shippers somewhere. Probably no more than 10 Draco SIs in the fandom, and not even sure there's even one where he bangs his mum.

** Malicious Magical Malfoy is a WIP that updated as recently as October. I'm enjoying it thus far. He loves his family, but no incest.

** I've found 40 stories on AO3 marked with Draco/Narcissa, majority of them smut. FFN probably has some more, but I'm guessing no more than like a hundred. I'm not even sure if there's 10 Draco SIs in the whole fandom, let alone 1 where's he's banging Narcissa.

It's an extremely unlikely pairing, because Draco as a main character is very heavily a female romance fantasy. He's almost exclusively paired with Harry or Hermione or an OC because they are the popular female fantasy pairing. Harry for the slash, and Hermione or the OC because it's often thinly veiled author inserts. Draco/Narcissa would almost exclusively be the realm of male writers, but he's an unpopular mc there. Canonically Draco is a cowardly jerk and a reoccurring but minor antagonist so he also isn't fleshed out. He makes for a very poor choice as a main character unless you're interested in romance of the mostly leather pants variety, or you believe that his character needs to be further fleshed out, in which case the story sticks more closely to canon. An SI takes this problem and goes even further: now, no longer are you just writing about him, you are him. Since the majority of the fandom is female, he's unlikely to be an SI for them since it doesn't resonate enough for someone to try for a redemption arc. Since he's an overall repugnant character with no resonant traits, he's not the ideal choice for a male writer either (unlike say Greg from Worm, where while he's a loser, he's a nerdy loser which resonates with a lot of that fandom). His main benefits as a character are that his family is old and wealthy, but a number of characters have that trait, including Harry, who would be a much popular choice. Still, this isn't enough to make Draco SIs rare and Draco SI/Narcissa almost an impossibility, but combine this with the very heavy aversion to SIs in the fandom, and it's led to this.

For some fun speculation: Not too sure why there's a heavy aversion to SIs in the fandom, but I suspect it may have to do with the very vocal Mary Sue hate at the time, which coincides with the release of the first movie and probably the rising of HP fanfics. Naruto, though of a similar age to HP, probably survived unscathed because the anime first came out in 2005, and the popularity of SIs there started around 2008 or so, with probably a massive boost around 2012-ish, when Dreaming of Sunshine came out.

*** I am going to blame the casting for Narcissa in the movies.

Do a google image search for “Stahma Tarr”, a character in the TV show Defiance. THIS is what I like to think of Narcissa being like, the looks, the demeanor, pretty much the whole character.

I am dreaming of SI love from her right now - maybe seeing what a shit he/I am becoming and taking me in hand to make me better using all the techniques available to her. To hell with society and their weak mores. (including alchemical, sexual, mental) All done as a strong capable woman taking direct action to make her son fit for society and life, as she sees it.

**** Even if Narcissa was the most beautiful woman in the world still wouldn't make Narcissa/Draco more common, let alone Draco SI/Narcissa. Even though incest is a common porn genre, I'm not convinced that most any viewer legitimately sees the mother in relation to the guy, just as a MILF. Draco still is a crappy character, and what'll happen instead is that there will be way more Harry/Narcissa.

***** True enough, especially as HP is the main.

Still, there seem to be Draco-redemption stories and I could see this becoming one of those, with a side of mommy-porn.

***** Oh, also, I read a fic a while back that had Narcissa helping a movement toward a revival of the pagan observances, and there she was portrayed as quite refined and able and having a clarity of thought as well as spiritual sensitivity.

I sort of default to thinking of her that way.

Your post reminds me that she really isn't so much shown in canon.

**** It's very uncommon, but not to the point where it's non-existent. SI [self-insertion] is mostly done for wish fulfillment, and is usually done with Harry, Hermione or someone they identify with. Not a lot of people identify with Draco given his rather unflattering traits in the books (and if you only want to be inserted as Draco to get monetary resources to suit whatever goals you have for the unsuspecting universe and don't care for the character itself, Harry is generally the more obvious option), so any such SI would likely have to be at least somewhat unwilling at the start.
