Harry is dark from what I remember, he meets Dumbledore and some other order members in a club (They come looking for him cause the need help), they believe harry has no involvement in the war but they know he is powerful. Truly though he is voldemort's lover and is doing to bring the order down. I remember he appeared sleazy to the reader, and Voldemort is jealous and possessive. Help me find this fic.
