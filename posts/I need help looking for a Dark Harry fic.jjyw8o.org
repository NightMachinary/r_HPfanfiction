I can't remember the name but Harry was in hus upper teens, 5th or 6th year, and was in love with Draco and they eventually got together. Harry was working with Voldemort, but i cant remember why. And Snape had gone to check on him at the Dursleys in the first bit. Sorry thats all i can remember, any help finding it would be appreciated. Thank You.
