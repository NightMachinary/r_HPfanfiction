It's called Six Pomegranate Seeds and it's massive at 43 very lengthy chapters. It's very well written, with good pacing and dialogue. It does have a tendency to switch point of view suddenly, but I don't think it works to its disadvantage. It does portray Hermione in an interesting way, clever and ruthless while also expanding on JKR's world. So many aspects of Magic are expanded on, like the power of the castle, Pureblood rituals, the mechanisms of Potions, House Elf magic, and even plausible backstories for the likes of Millicent Bullstrode and Marcus Flint. There is no romance, but I find that preferable. It's rated M for mature themes of violence, but it's well worth the read. I literally spent the past ten hours reading it almost nonstop. I think the story is winding down, next chapter will be the Final Battle and I thought you guys might like the reccomendation.


** +Oh is it complete? I remember reading this way back+ Oh i remember this fic now. I found it so annoying that Hermione acts completely OOC in this fic. She has zero friends, to the point that i wondered if any human can survive like that. She is in fear of changing the time-line to the extent that her absolute inaction is extremely bothersome. She takes on abuse like she's doing penance. This is one of those well written fics that I find absolutely abhorrent

*** I had this with a Harry Potter time-travel story a while back.

The premise was something like HP is married to Fleur, she dies when HP is like 129 years old or something, a few days later HP dies and somehow ends up back in 4th year.

He hardly remembers anything from that time, but he does know he time travelled, but apparently he's unwilling or incapable of changing the timeline.

Like, if you're going to write a time travel fic, I feel like you /have/ to change the story.

**** it becomes a canon rewrite with a few ocs thrown in and minimal development. I find such fics so damn frustrating, basically the same HP only worse characterization

This. If you don't want to change the timeline, then at least have the character leave Hogwarts and Britain, and do something else. But regurgitating the canon plotline? No thanks.

***** Time travel is the ultimate form of deus ex machina. It should be EASY to win if you go back to your old universe, like in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]], linkffn(10871795).

But, if you end up in a different universe where things are different and your advance knowledge may even be counterproductive, then things could be really challenging and interesting. For example, canon protagonists would be dead meat against the Voldemort in your “Patron” and “Divided”, time travels or not.

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

***** I think the Debt of Time did a good job sealing up loopholes for the Time Travel thing - it's like it was canon all along, with some minor changes. It examines the interesting tidbit that time is a loop, and all that you do is something you'd already done, kind of thing.

The canon plot line in that is somewhat regurgitated but the characterization and in-depth story of the Marauders is amazing. And the Marauders are not my favorite, and I still re-read this fic.

*** Sometimes you just have to go in assuming the main character is an original character but the author cheated a little because no one reads fics about OCs.

*** I actually remember messaging the author almost a year ago with very similar thoughts: it must be very lonely for her, I said. The author pointed out that she was already changed; that the year on the run had hardened her, and I grew to accept that. Besides, she does make some friends -- although, it is mostly just a house-elf.

Overall, this is a fic that is a very rare find: it doens't follow many of my preferences in fanfiction, but I read it regardless, because of phenomenal world-building and a great mystery that is still yet to be resolved, as we still don't know what happened in the very beginning.

I'd really urge you to give it another try.

*** Yeah Hermione is OOC, and she doesn't change the timeline, but I like that the author gives excuses for both of those reasons so it can stay as cannon comlpliant as long as possible to fix what went horribly wrong at the Final Battle. It's more like a companion piece. And she kind of become friends with Justin Finch-Fletchley, Theodore Nott, Marcus Flint and most recently Susan Bones. But she always has to keep them at a distance both because of her secret and to maintain her cover. But everyone likes different things about time-travel stories, to me this one was unique in its subset of the Time travelling Hermione genre

**** I honestly didn't find the author's justifications compelling enough. Especially for a character like Hermione who literally bent time to attend a few extra classes, it seemed like a bit too much to be so entirely un-involved. Anyway that was my takeaway from it

****** TBH I can't say i am unbiased about the author as well because the one other fic I've read had a rather disheartening ending, so the whole fic felt quite disappointing. Overall I think it is a case of reader not relating to the author, it happens to everyone at some point or the other.

  At the end, something happened. Hermione clutches at one fraying thread, uncertain whether she is Arachne or Persephone. What she does know is that she will keep fighting to protect her friends even if she must walk a dark path. *time travel*

** Ohhh this sounds really interesting! I was actually reading another Hermione time travel story earlier but I had to quit about 4 chapters bc Hermione had no personality at all and for some reason had all the boys (the marauders) fighting over her. It was painful to read. So thanks for the recommendation!
