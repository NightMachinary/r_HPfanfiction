Brewing potions seems like the most useful thing to focus on while under age, especially for muggleborn students (even more so if you live in an abusive household). Yet it seems like the only ones that even think about the possibilities are the Weasley twins and they manage to do awesome stuff with it.

So any fanfics where harry sees the light?


** One amazing series is the Pureblood Pretense series. Its got 4 books in it so far, and each of them are actually exteremely long and very very well written. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense]]

**** It's actually only abandoned since November, because the author had a planned absence from June until then. She went traveling somewhere. She has a AN on her profile page where she says she's almost done with the new chapter. >.<

She said that eight months ago. :/ I wish she'd start updating again, too, since I don't read unfinished stories, but....

******* It's not abandoned! Sister (author's sister, author is Vi) says she's extremely busy with her job but has a lot of the next chapter written, but hasn't finished it yet. It could be a few months before she can get enough time from her job (it's new and therefore she is settling in still, and before that she took a break to travel and couldn't update), but that it is definitely NOT abandoned and that she will update us with lots of long looooong chapters in the upcoming months, once she is ready.

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

**** A painball gun filled with potion balls is basically just an upgraded blowgun.

A wizard gun would be more like a Caster from Outlaw Star IMO. Unpowered spells placed onto a bullet then inserted into shell enchanted to transfer mana to the the bullet and launch it. Slap it into the casting device that channels the mana to the shell. Pull the trigger to "cast" your spell by releasing your mana into the casting device. Squibs could use mana potion powered Casters since they don't have an internal mana supply.
