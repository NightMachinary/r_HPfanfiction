Anybody know any good bashing fics preferably a Hermione one.


** I don't agree with how hard this fic bashes her rigidity and bookishness, but in a fandom that often wanks Hermione to incredible levels, a fic bashing her can be palate cleansing.

  Hermione attends a very one-sided, yet eye-opening, job interview. Some non-canon content; not for Hermione fanatics.

***** Agreed: I read a few paragraphs and noped out. An interviewer for that position could reasonably point out that Hermione is good at memorising and reciting information, but less so at synthesizing new information. They couldn't reasonably say "you did some stupid shit when you were a child," 'cause, y'know, that's not how job interviews work.

****** The interviewer is clearly an author stand-in. He know things there's no way any interviewer could know, or are we supposed to infer that the ministry had peoples hiding in the girls closet at Hogwarts, taking note when Hermione didn't ask her roommates for beauty tips ? Also any sensible person would have retreated the second an interviewer started telling you how you should have handled your sentimental life in high school.

It's so stupidly written, the basic idea of taking Hermione down a notch could have been executed way better. And if the point was to take apart Hermione then it should at least have stuck to her canon mistakes and avoid piling made up shit on top of it. I know I should expect nothing from a bashing fic but this one was particularly egregious.

** The ones I can think of are linkffn(A Cadmean Victory; Susan Bones and the Prisoner of Azkaban). The first one is a meh story because Harry is your usual broody indy!Harry who gets mad at the world, the second is meh because again he's kinda like that and on top of that the story becomes ridiculously difficult to follow at the end, which caused me to drop it.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
