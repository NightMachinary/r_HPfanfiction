Given that Harry Potter fanfiction has been a thing since the 90s, and probably quite a big fandom since the early 2000s, surely there was some crossover?

Also I'm sure I remember Jo leaving hints and people going off on a completely different direction than how canon ended up with them.

**** I'm a lot more amenable to Wizarding aristocracy in principle than I am with magical cores. I think that the execution in much of fanfiction leaves much to be desired. There definitely seems to be an exploitable angle; certainly canon leaves room for it, as the mechanics of the Wizengamot and Wizarding politics in general are largely unexplored in canon. I can see developing this, and going with the idea that Voldemort was much more symptom than illness being interesting.

I hate magical cores in principle however, it conflicts too much with one of the main themes of canon of choices being more important than destiny. Once you take the idea of magical cores, you are very quickly forced into the idea of Voldemort, Dumbledore, and usually Harry just straight up being more powerful than most others in a very straightforward way. It not only diminishes the contributions of others to the fight, it also makes Harry's choice (or lack thereof) to enter the fight less meaningful to be by making him the only person that /can/ take on Voldemort.

** Post-OotP everyone was expecting some kind of exploration of the nature of the Veil.

Everyone expected Dumbledore to mentor Harry in powerful magic. The start of HBP made you think this was coming true, but turned out to be history classes.

Pre-HBP, most people thought Voldemort would be killed via some special spell, one powered in some sense by love, this being the force that opposed Voldemort and had already shown itself to be greater than him.

Many people anticipated that Harry would learn to become an animagus, though this diminished with each book that came out.

Pre-HBP, many expected a resumption of the DA and occlumency lessons.

**** I think this is an anachronistic view. As late as OotP, it still looked like Harry was being singled out as a cut above his peers. PoA we had the Patronus Charm, GoF we had Harry's success in the tournament (particularly the spells he learnt for the third task), OotP he led the DA, teaching students who were years older, and successfully duelled Death Eaters.

The first cracks appeared in OotP, when he had the problems with occlumency, but at the time that could be put down to problems of motivation/working with Snape, rather than any innate weakness.

Then HBP happened. Occlumency training was not resumed, Harry struggled with non-verbal magic (which it turns out the older students failed to mention during the DA), there were repeated mentions of him being utterly confused by the material in class, the DA stopped, Snape completely wiped the floor with him.

HBP thoroughly normalised Harry, destroying much that was special about him.

The one silver lining is that suddenly at the start of DH we see him using spells that we never saw him learn in HBP, so it may have been a problem of JKR failing to show Harry continuing to learn, rather than an actual failure.

What I meant was that Harry becoming almost Dumbledore/Voldemort tier in his magical ability (Harry beat Dumbledore in a duel in /Awakening Power/ IIRC) was always going to be wishful thinking. Voldemort was always going to be defeated by deus ex machina rather than a talent-based magical duel.

Regarding HBP, you neglected to mention another instance -- the thing with the inferi where Harry panics and doesn't use any fire spells. I had always thought till then that keeping his head in a crisis was one of Harry's greatest talents, but HBP undermined that also.

I try to write off the duel with Snape as a one-off case because Snape knew legilimency -- he took on DEs in OoTP and DH just fine, I have no idea why HBP seemed to be under a mission to make Harry look as weak as possible. Did JKR ever address this in any of her interviews?

**** Wishful thinking or not, it fits within the category of fanon tropes (with no small amount of canon support--see [[/u/Taure]]'s excellent post) that proved false in the end. There's a reason why sites like DLP, that favor a stronger main character, became so popular following the release of HBP. Even the most stridently romance-focused authors and sites (Jeconais, SIYE, Phoenixsong, etc.) were spinning tales at the time of a strong Harry able to hold his own magically.

I always thought DLP formed from the backlash off all the Harry/Ginny, H/Hr and slash stories, and generally canon friendly stuff that were popular at the time. Most of the popular authors -- Rosswrock, Barb, Joe, Sib, Melindaleo Arabella and almost everyone at Sugarquill wrote canon-friendly Harry/Ginny, while Cassy Claire and the folks at Fiction Alley wrote H/Hr, and nothing can become popular without dissenters, and so formed DLP with its male-heavy audience and general bashing of canon, Ginny bashing in particular.

Also, as you point out, many non-DLP stories had a relatively strong Harry anyway, so couldn't have been the main reason for DLP's increasing popularity at the time.

At least that's my impression of the site. It's no longer as bad, and the focus has generally shifted to quality stories, but that is my impression of early DLP. I could be wrong, of course, and you would know better than me being being a long time member yourself.

I think this is "mid DLP" rather than early DLP. Early DLP really wasn't pairing-focused at all. The clue to the early DLP was in the name: /Dark/ Lord Potter. In most of the strong Harry fanfic out there, Harry was still on Dumbledore's side, playing the all-American jock hero. DLP grew up around the stories where Harry was strong but willing to use dark magic i.e. early indy!Harry. The early library categories were stuff like "dark Harry", "dark but lightsided Harry", "Azkaban Harry", "super Harry", etc.

"See folks, look at how happy they are at becoming glorified desk jockeys working for the probably still incredibly corrupt and infinitely self-serving totalitarian regime that did their level best to ruin their lives when they were teenagers! And look, children! They have kids! With horrible names! Woohoo."

Given how they spent their teenage years (castle of dubious educational repute, hostile teachers, hostile government, the odd murderhobo wandering in under the nose of the Greatest Wizard Of The Times looking to engage in a spot of the ole ultraviolence, monsters, Dark Magic and high school, oh my), this was not what I would have expected to see from any of the Hogwarts class of '98 alumni.

A better version would have been to have them married with children, yes, but having careers in fields that are best described as Mad Max with Magic rather than The Office; Hogwarts edition. Then I'd believe that whole 'all is well' thing.

Muggles being as worthy of life as wizards was certainly a theme. Muggles are wizards' equals on a moral level. They're equally human, deserve equal rights, deserve respect, etc.

Wizarding society not being morally superior to Muggle society was also a theme. The idea that each society has their own set of prejudices.

But I don't think it was ever the case that JKR was trying to say that the wizarding and Muggle worlds were equally attractive places to live. It was always the case that the wizarding world was a better place to spend your time: Harry is constantly wishing to return to the wizarding world whenever he is in the Muggle world; Hermione is always spending large amounts of time during the holidays away from her parents. Magic is depicted as constantly amazing, fun and, well, magical. The wizarding world is full of adventure, the Muggle world is full of offices.

It's especially notable that Hermione identifies enough as a witch to confund her parents and completely upend their lives without their consent. Even Muggleborns rapidly switch identification to that of members of the wizarding world, not the Muggle one.

******** It still seems a bit elitist though. Now that I'm older, I'm also less cool with the way squibs are casualty treated as a joke.

I get that magic is magical but at the same time, it annoys me more now that our heroes can be viewed as just as exclusionary and patronising as the Malfoys, except to a different group of people.

****** Ron/Harry are aurors, and I wouldn't consider "Dark wizard catcher" to be particularly boring. I don't think Harry could have been satisfied as a quidditch player because he's physically incapable of not poking his nose into problems/mysteries. I can't imagine him sitting at the breakfast table reading an article about a series of werewolf attacks and thinking "gee, I hope they find this guy" and then going off to play quidditch. He needs to be involved. Even in HBP, he almost wishes he could skip the match just to find out what Malfoy is doing. His need to solve mysteries > his need to play Quidditch.

In addition, they have a lot of power and influence after the war, so why not change things from the inside? Hermione didn't just join the Ministry and push pencils, she pushed through reforms and became a fairly influential figure.

Seriously! I was floored that Harry wanted to be an Auror in OOtP after GoF's and QTtA's descriptions of professional Quidditch. He has natural talent. Why not use that when you don't have a barmy old wizard trying to kill you? Certainly seems a lot more satisfying than serving a likely recalcitrant and stodgy bureaucracy.

******* I always imagined Harry went into Aurors because I imagine there was a lot of work to do chasing after former Death Eaters and dealing with the fallout from the war. He did want to become an Auror in OotP, and he seems like the sort that would feel like it is his duty to help fix everything and get the wizarding world back to normal.

******* Harry is physically incapable of minding his own business. He likes to solve mysteries and he needs to be involved.

Just as he likes to handle things himself rather than run to a teacher, he's not the kind of person who would be comfortable letting the aurors handle it while he plays Quidditch. It's really hard to imagine him sitting at breakfast and reading about a spat of attacks and thinking "gee, hope the Aurors catch whoever it is," and then going off to spend the day signing autographs and speaking to reporters.

He likes quidditch, but I think he sees it as a hobby/release not a full-time passion. In HBP, he's so wrapped up in the mystery of Draco Malfoy that he starts neglecting quidditch:

#+begin_quote
  This was infuriating; he was already cutting it fine to get to the match on time and yet there was Malfoy, skulking off while the rest of the school was absent: Harry's best chance yet of discovering what Malfoy was up to.
#+end_quote

[Harry goes down to the pitch and Ginny asks him why he's late, he tells her he met Malfoy]

#+begin_quote
  "So I wanted to know how come he's up at the castle with a couple of girlfriends while everyone else is down here."

  "Does it matter right now?"

  "Well, I'm not likely to find out, am I?" said Harry, seizing his Firebolt and pushing his glasses straight. "Come on then!"

  "[Ginny] reckons you only just arrived on time for the match. How come? You left here early enough."

  "Oh . . ." said Harry, as the scene in his mind's eye imploded. "Yeah . . . well, I saw Malfoy sneaking off with a couple of girls who didn't look like they wanted to be with him, and that's the second time he's made sure he isn't down on the Quidditch pitch with the rest of the school; he skipped the last match too, remember?" Harry sighed. *"Wish I'd followed him now, the match was such a fiasco. . . ."*

  "Don't be stupid," said Ron sharply. "You couldn't have missed a Quidditch match just to follow Malfoy, you're the Captain!"

  *"I want to know what he's up to," said Harry.* "And don't tell me it's all in my head, not after what I overheard between him and Snape ---"

Because that would have been stupid. Harry didn't fight Voldemort because Voldemort wanted to kill him. He fought Voldemort because he wanted to save lives and because of personal loss at his hands. Is there any reason why his "People Saving Thing" would vanish after he killed Voldemort? An Auror feels like a completely appropriate career choice, certainly more appropriate than a glamorous Quidditch star, which would have made him everything he was not.

******* I cringe at the epilogue too, but I think Harry not wanting to play pro quidditch is totally in character. He is consistently portrayed throughout the series as uncomfortable with his fame and also as a fairly private person. Can you think of a career less likely to appeal to that side of him than a pro athlete? Have you seen how they're treated in the UK tabloids?

******** I think that a lot of the conflation between Quidditch stars and football players is mostly fanon. Indeed, given the breadth of Harry's injuries and his lack of reaction to most of them, Quidditch seems to resemble rugby more than football. "Football is 90 minutes of pretending to be hurt, rugby is 80 minutes pretending you're not."

Ron's reaction to Krum is quite fanboyish, but Krum never seems to like his fame either so I don't think disliking the adulation of others is a barrier to entry into the professional league. After defeating Voldemort, Harry Potter will be famous even if he decides his lifelong ambition is cleaning up dog shite in Hogsmeade. Harry enjoys Quidditch immensely almost from the beginning of the series, but Aurors are only mentioned in passing in GoF and Harry's desire to join their ranks isn't given any exposition until 3/4ths of the way through OOtP - a comparatively late addition.

The argument that there were more Death Eaters to round up doesn't hold water with me either. The Malfoys were some of the worst offenders and got off scott free.

But if he plays quidditch, he'll stay in the public eye. If he becomes an auror, he can have privacy and have more control over how he's presented to the public. He doesn't need to attend after-game press conferences or participate in any photo ops. He can live his adult life as a normal person.

You don't have to like being famous to play professional Quidditch, but it certainly helps. Harry would consider attention from fans to be a significant downside. And Krum doesn't completely hate being famous, since he rhetorically asks what the point of being an international famous quidditch player is if all of the good looking girls are taken.

That doesn't mean there weren't other Death Eaters that needed to be rounded up.
