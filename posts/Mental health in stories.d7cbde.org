Hey all! I went browsing a bit yesterday and just realized that the field is a bit... empty, when it comes to mental health issues. Especially when it comes to OCs. Like... people try to make a girl NOT into a Mary Sue, by giving her "faults" like talking a lot or being clumsy, but I've never actually seen a charater have BPD or ADD or something like that. And I mean not only in name, but with actual symptoms. Have I just been missing those? I was kinda laying awake last night thinking about Harry dating a Muggle woman with BPD... and I normaly don't like OSs that much, but I feel like representation might actually matter here and I guess wizards have healing methods to prevent these illnesses.

What do you think?


** Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13130447/1/Anonymous]]) is largely centered around an OC grappling with PTSD and alcoholism, but it's really the only fic I can think of off the top of my head that does anything like this. That said, it might be for the best; as someone with a grab bag of mental illnesses, I for one would prefer no representation to bad representation.

  Harry never thought that he wouldn't even know the name of the person he trusted most. After the War, McGonagall forced students involved to anonymously contact each other weekly. At first, Harry thought it was a cheesy attempt to show the Light and the Dark aren't that different from each other. Now, he feels like he can't be without her, even though they never met. HPxOC

** I think that there are bigger things to worry about in the HP universe than the representation of mental illnesses, especially those not based on the plot (eg PTSD and childhood trauma for Harry). Like, you have a government which makes a banana republic look like the definition of integrity, a criminal/judicial system which does not work properly ONCE in canon, a fascist takeover and the resulting racial persecution, the effects of said persecution, the aftermath of a civil war and so on. I honestly don't see how you can properly fit a good, in-depth representation of an unrelated mental illness on top of that.

**** Because you are suggesting an Muggle OC and not, let's say Ginny or Hermione. Also PTSD seems the likelier result of what they go through.

Additionally, Harry is by far the most obvious choice for someone suffering from mental illness, not some random OC. You can justify almost any psychological damage with canonical Dursley abuse alone, nevermind what goes down at Hogwarts (although Harry appears functional even under duress, so I'd argue that the most common depiction in fanfics is poorly done).

** I don't think they have healing methods for mental illness, personally. There's probably potions similar to the medications that we use.

That being said, I think while it would be interesting to see someone write characters with mental issues you'd definitely have to find a writer who either has BPD (not sure if you mean bipolar or borderline personality disorder) or knows someone on a very close level who has it for it to be written in a correct manner. I suffer from mental illness myself and something like BPD is very, very complex.

** I found this myself actually, as a person with clinical depression and PTSD from past trauma, that there was a lack of solid representation of the more realistic side of mental health issues.

I did actually make an attempt at giving a better representation in one of my fics, wherein Harry deals with PTSD as a result of the Wizarding War and gets some treatment for it, and other characters in the fic dealt with mental issues as well, in what I hope was a realistic (i.e. drawing from my own experience) way.

***** Well, this is very close to my heart. I was just discharged from the hospital last week. Again. I assume you know what it's like. Bad episodes happen. I was just moved by the stories of all the other patients and how similiar they were to my own. I never really knew I wasn't alone before, because either there is no representation or it's just simplified and over the top.

And I am looking forward to that link, thanks!

** I can remember reading a few stories with addiction in them (mainly to potions rather than muggle drugs) and at least a couple that dealt with things like Harry having a life altering injury at work and then suffering depression as he deals with the aftermath. That said, I haven't read anything about BPD or ADHD. For some reason I see those issues as either suitable for AUs or for next gen fics (who knows what Rosie or Scorpio or Albus are really like?). Most mental health fics I've read are about (probably poor representations of) multiple personality disorder or Stockholm syndrome, though I suppose there are quite a few with depression, though I don't know how realistically it is portrayed.

** The best person who can understand Harry's trauma is none other than Ginny:

- They are the only two persons who had been intimately violated by Voldemort and lived to tell the tale. Even Hermione couldn't claim this feat.
- Ginny was a founding member of his student resistance group Dumbledore's Army, and it was her who came up with the name.
- She, Hermione, and Luna were the only girls who had been with him on that ill fated DoM battle from beginning to the end. No other women could possibly imagine the horrors and stress of facing 12 of Voldemort most vicious sadistic genocidal magical Nazi scums.
- Next year, Ginny again fought directly in the Astronomy Tower Battle, in fact facing Amycus Carrow directly. Hermione and Luna were duped by Snape and missed most of the fighting.
- But it was Year 7 that should be most traumatizing for them all. The kids at Hogwarts didn't have it any better than the Trio as they were constantly subjected to terror and torture.

Do you really think that some Muggle OC would be better at understanding and sharing Harry's pain than Ginny, Hermione, or Luna? Or any other who had participated in DA, in the Year 7 resistance, and in the Battle of Hogwarts?

*** For some part of the Voldemort trauma, I fully agree. Ginny was the only one who had a similar experience.

Yet, on the other hand, there was a time in DH where it was Harry and Hermione against the world. The DA had each other, Ron had his family, but they had no one but themselves. Which is honestly why I don't see any other pairing than H/Hr work after a canon Horcrux hunt. They get together, not out of love, but out of a desperate need to feel ANY positive human emotion.

And before anyone points out Ron, yes he was with them for most of the Horcrux hunt, but not for the darkest two months, rock bottom so to speak. Try walking through a dark forest. With three people it is fun, you banter, someone is always there to pick up the conversation. But with two people, it gets tense really quickly.

**** I think it's very conceivable for Hermione to look for psychologists and therapists who speak English and know magical world. She might not find any or not one soon enough.

When Hogwarts reopened in September 1998, they would face hundreds of traumatized and often vindictive kids. They better organize some self groups or things could get ugly fast. The Carrows regularly used kids, especially first years, as Cruciatus practice dummies in detentions. If those who willingly abetted them in torturing their fellow students had not been sufficiently punished up to this point, serious revenge attacks would absolutely happen.

****** I'm not a fan of dragging some unrelated Muggle OCs into play here. As I have explained before, the best way is for them to get organized and try to help each other first, while looking for professional help within magical community at same time. Of course, they could find some of their Muggle relatives who actually specialize in this field.

But if this idea is solely about shipping Harry with a Muggle OC because of his PTSD and etc, I don't think it will be a good one.
