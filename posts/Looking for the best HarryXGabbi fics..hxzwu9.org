So I just had a dream in which I was Lord Harry James Potter Black and was dating Gabriel Delacour (who was Ginnys age). The dream ended kinda sad which in turn has left me feeling a little bummed out...

So now I'm looking for a preferably complete Harry/Gabriel fic which is well done, preferably with a happy ending to cheer me up!

Thanks!

** The Reluctant Champion: linkffn(13160344)

This story takes place in an AU where they couldn't save Sirius - Harry witnessed him getting the Kiss. As a result, he's not exactly in the best of states throughout the fic - grief will do things to a person.

They meet properly at the World Cup, and later at the Triwizard Tournament - which is expanded to include duelling and Quidditch.

Story is incomplete but will get picked back up eventually - early chapters are currently being rewritten for reasons of "Author was 14 and beta-less when he uploaded these".

  Book 1 of a Trilogy: Harry Potter thought his life could not get any worse. No parents, the worst childhood one could ever imagine, and now no godfather. Harry Potter was wrong. When his name comes out of The Goblet of Fire, Harry is abandoned by those closest to him, and is sure that he is truly and completely alone. Once again, Harry Potter was wrong.

  The events of the second task of the Tri-Wizard Tournament will have great and long lasting effects. Join Harry as he comes into his own with the help of family. Events will push pairing together but not instant soul bond. Harry is angry about his treatment by those at school but not betrayal, mainly disagreements. Good but human Dumbles. Rated T for mild language.
