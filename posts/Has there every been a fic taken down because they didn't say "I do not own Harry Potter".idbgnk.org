I find that it's better to adopt a libertarian stance on most stuff like this, as people will write whatever they wanna write and you can't, and shouldn't, impede on their freedoms- until real people start getting hurt. Encourage writers to tag their works for sensitive/triggering material so you can both enjoy using the same website without disturbing each other.

It was so poorly written and so out there I didn't have a clue what the hell was happening in it, and once I did I noped out faster than I ever had in my life. If I thought it would do anything I would have reported the story, and I was and still am genuinely concerned for whoever it was that wrote it.

************* Yeah, it was user error, but there are still lines that should be drawn. Hate speech is rightfully and legally censored daily. Death threats, which are entirely fiction until acted upon, are illegal and punishable under the law. Fiction written by certain individuals is used as evidence when diagnosing mental problems and treatments, which becomes censorship in all but name. Slander is illegal. While there is room for debate about the sexualization of minors to some degree, with stuff like age of consent and same age couplings blurring the lines, the sexualization of pre-teens is pretty universally vilified, and is the basis for the US laws banning fictional works of minors committing sexual acts. The list goes on.

The point is, fiction is censored all the time with good reason in many cases. Maybe you disagree with me about were the line should be drawn, more power to you if you do, but there is no denying that the line exists.

It is vilified (rightfully so), but art- particularly the majority which is fluff- is not real life and shouldn't be held to the same standard.

I have to say, the absolute funniest thing to me was reading up on US law to verify your comment is that the third “tong” of the US obscenity law is “does it contain value as art” because apparently a judge/jury has the power to decide if art has value

*************** The way I see it, it's the intent part that makes it an issue. I agree that art is an exception, but then the problem will always come down to how is it supposed to be judged or verified as art. Like you said, it's ridiculous that a jury should be a deciding factor on that, but then it's equally so to pass off every instance as just art assuming the creator says so. So what other choice is there than to let other people decide.

It would be stupid to look too far into a lot of things that could fall into question, since many are quite obvious as being art, but examples like the story I described aren't so cut and dry. Was it intended as art or was it an outlet showcasing the author's intent in real life to some unknown degree. It's not like that was just part of the story or it was looked at as bad or someone was trying to stop it, it was the sole purpose of the story and was written as if it was desirable. Intent is understandably punishable in the law for a lot of different things, so it's not like responding to it for this would be inconceivable.

So if the intent is punishable, and a work gives reason to believe it is displaying intent for pedophilia, or murder, or rape, what's to be done? Death threats get jail time, but that's because like you said they are a directed threat in real life. So we have possible intent with no specified target, so you can't jail them, but should the work still be circulated if it was made for that purpose? I personally don't think it should, and there's no part of me that thinks otherwise because even if that story was written as art, i don't see how it adds anything of value to society or to the people who read it. The only real argument that can be made for keeping it is entertainment, but then I also don't want anything around that supports that type of entertainment in the first place. All things considered, censorship is not the worst solution here, even if it's also not the best.

It's a wash, though. Like I said, it's fine if you disagree, I'm certainly not going to judge you for it. But I'll stand by what I said, same as you.

"Pedophilia is not an act, sexual assault is. This incorrect use of the term "pedophilia" needs to be avoided because although people who commit child sexual abuse are sometimes pedophiles, the meaning of the terms does not concentrate on it. Not all people who have sexually abused children are pedophiles. /Only/ when an offender has a /primary or exclusive sexual interest/ in */prepubescent children/* is when he can be called a *pedophile*.

You are misusing that word, even though its a common mistake. It would only, by definition apply before puberty.

"Pedophilia is termed as pedophilic disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), and the manual defines it as a paraphilia involving intense and recurrent sexual urges towards and fantasies about prepubescent children that have either been acted upon or which cause the person with the attraction distress or interpersonal difficulty.

Give it a read. Neither the article or myself condone sexual abuse of children. It just better to be educated.

​

I just get annoyed by words being misused as hateful labels.

Pedophilia would work if its an adult with a 1st year(female) student

Hebephilia would be better for the 2nd and 3rd year female students

Ephebophilia would probably cover all the other girls/young women.

​

Guys hit puberty later generally so those "years" wold be different for them...

​

​

As for everything else... honestly i find A lot of pairing sick and am disgusted by ANY words written about them.

Is Hermione/Snape any worse than Harry/Voldemort(no matter the age). Or what about Hermione/Draco, a "racist", elitist, spoiled, bully paired with one of his victims?

******** Just because it's a relationship with a large age gap doesn't mean it's pedophilia. They could actually like each other despite the age difference. Not that I'm defending actual pedophilia, but sometimes people don't see teens as children. They see them as a potential partner and not a little kid they've known. That doesn't explicitly mean it's bad.

That being said, I don't like Snamione. But I think she can make her own decisions.

Pedophilia has been a new trend on Reddit recently. Grooming is everywhere, etc. Every relationship has grooming. How do you think you're get someone to like you? You show your best qualities and do this and what not. The thing is, people only like to call it grooming when it's between an older person and a younger person (not necessarily between an adult and a minor). Grooming isn't trying to get someone to like you. And, regardless of the first half of this reply, everyone needs to calm the fuck down.

Also, lifespan is a huge thing. Five years seems like a bigger gap to us since we have half the lifespan.

Also Harry being the final Horcrux and the final battle beginning with a siege of Hogwarts were quite common as well, but that that was the intent was quite obvious.

I also remember this particular fic (I think it was called either "The Seventh Horcrux" or "The Secret Horcrux) which was completed before the release of the Deathly Hallows where the author predicted that Ravenclaw's heirloom was a crown (in that story Auntie Muriel's tiara was a replica of it) and it was located in the Room of Requirements exactly at the same location as the diadem in DH. The author also kept an emphasis on the fact that Harry had to die, but eventually uses the Golden Snitch to create a Horcrux but puts Voldemort's piece of soul in it instead of his.

Also a lot of stories ended with Harry meeting Dumbledore or/and his family in the afterlife immediately before or after his final confrontation with Voldemort.

Then there was the Godric's Hollow attack scene but that one should have also been quite intuitive.

I felt like OotP and HBP were far more different than fans would have expected (that was about the time when the HP fanfiction community was at its beginnings), but when I read DH, I felt like I've read a lot of times before.

***** No she didn't.

This is what makes her a good writer. She built everything up with clues to the reader that some clever people could have guessed what was going to happen.

Harry being a horcux: 5th book had hugeee signs.

Locations of the horcruxes... Not unsurprising for one to be at hogwarts. Makes sense for the plot and voldemort. And there isn't that many places she could have put it that hid it from Dumbledore. She even mentioned the tiara when Harry entered the room of forgotten things in the 6th book.

Attack during the wedding... We knew there would be a wedding at the end of the 6th book. Good time to enter an attack.

She's always been great at foreshadowing. One of her best skills as a writer is her mystery elements.

The things that were unpredictable, like the hallows, had no similarities in fanfiction.

#+end_quote

The Deathly Hallows as a group no, but even in DH, only the Elder Wand arc spans throughout the book and there were definitely fanfics about Harry getting a stronger wand or some sort of weapon to beat Voldemort. Everyone knew about the Cloak of Invisibility and the part played by the Resurrection Stone was replaced in other stories by other means to finally talk to his family.

Regardless, you might be right and JKR did a lot of foreshadowing. I was still very young when the books were being released so maybe my brain overlooked some details. Even so, when I read DH first time it felt like I had read it several times before and I could easily guess where it's going. I sort of wished JK left more red herrings such as the unopenable door at DoM.

******* Yep, dunno why you got downvotes, though “foreshadowing” is maybe a bit strong for that “found a room full of chamber pots” that Dumbledore mentions at the Yule ball. Maybe “references” or something, but still, this absolutely happened.

Same with the diadem being in the RoR, people were making a big deal about that because Harry found it in HBP when he hid the potions book, and same with the throwaway mention of the “heavy gold locket none of them could open” in OotP. They were heavily theorized on places like Mugglenet to be some of the remaining horcruxes, so it's really completely unsurprising to find them cropping up in fanfic before DH. Plenty of people were theorizing then about Harry being one too, though not as many as were talking about those two items.

** As I understand it, in Þe olde days of fanfiction, it was not uncommon for fanfics to be targeted by copyright/trademark complaints. A lot of early fanfiction was hidden away to avoid the attention of authors and publishers. Anne Rice was particularly anti-fanfiction, to the point where I'm pretty sure ffnet still prohibits any content based on her works. The disclaimers are something of a holdover from the dark times and something of an attempt at protecting oneself if some author or their publisher decides to get a bug up their arse about fanfic again.

****** I read the first Assassin's Apprentice book and I got pissed off that (A) Almost all the characters were dumb. (B) Spoilers for Assassin's Apprentice:

The assassins almost never killed anyone and seemed really reluctant to do it. If you're writing about assassins you should be willing to write about assassination. I think maybe one person was killed in the entire book and it was made very clear they were evil first.

One of the worst parts is that the main character is painfully stupid and passive. He finds his enemy's base and doesn't tell anyone. He finds out he has a superpower that would be really helpful so he never explores it. He has enemies but never thinks or worries about them.

Although I have read on forums that the main character is meant to be stupid per the author, it got to be really frustrating. You can see what is going on sooo obviously and yet it eludes him. There are no unexpected twists or turns it is like "Who might have tried to hurt me? Oh, he hates me and had means and opportunity and I was hurt with his special technique. Ghee whiz who could it be?" I just found it rage inducing to wade through. This isn't Watson to Holmes, or Hastings to Poirot, this is more like Harry Potter from the perspective of Crabbe and Goyle.

The pace is stupidly slow too. This story needs proper editing and could be trimmed down by at least half if not two thirds. It is mostly mundanity, a literal day by day sequence filled almost exclusively with junk (much of which isn't plot relevant). Ages spent on his writing lessons to no effect etc. And the main character makes no friends so there are few relationships being built in this time making it more pointless exposition.

That is the other problem. The main character almost never speaks. It improves slightly towards the end but it makes almost all of the talking into exposition where one character is just talking AT our protagonist. Really frustrating.

The king intentionally surrounds himself with betrayers and incompetents and then is constantly betrayed. Funny that.

There are lots of references to the castle/keep yet with all the towers and internal gardens it sounds like a very late medieval palace rather than a fortified building. Made it hard to picture in my head.

So yeah, I expected one of the best fantasy series of recent times and ended up with a story that made Methods of Rationality look good.

- The authors themselves, which JKR doesn't seem to mind but you'll note many archives refuse to get any more threats from Anne Rice et al.

- Movie studios like Warner Bros, who own a lot of HP's visual/merch IP.

In the early 2000s, WB was well-known for sending cease and desist notices to fansite webmasters and fanfic archives where people would add movie stills or promo shots as covers of their fics. I personally helped clean up a couple of sites in a tripod webring to be sure we had adequate disclaimers and minimal high-res promo stills.

This is a problem to this day. Remember a couple weeks ago when Harry Potter With Guns made the front page of reddit? Yep well that sudden popularity caught some attention from WB and guess what they had to take it down from harrypotterwithguns.com

** IANAL, but from what I understand, /at best/ such a disclaimer may be a defence for a /trademark/ infringement or maybe consumer fraud lawsuit (i.e., representing your own work as that of someone more famous). It has no bearing on copyright, though /maybe/ some copyright owners might be less inclined to send a takedown notice or to sue if they see the disclaimer---but that's their decision, not a legal bar.

To what extent fictional characters and settings are copyrightable separately from the text and the plot is, AFAIK, a question that has not been adjudicated in any court unambiguously; and nor has the question of whether it's fair use (US) / fair dealing (UK, Australia, and others) been adjudicated unambiguously.

Personally, I hope some author sues and the fic writer fights it out. The worst case scenario is that the court decides that characters and settings are copyrightable---but since fanfic sites already act as if they are, nothing is lost; but if they can convince a court that they shouldn't be, that's a lot more freedom for fanfic writers.

*** Actually, it has been somewhat litigated. See derivative works.

Basically, if you remove the "original's{" elements from the story and you still have a good story, you're not a derivative work of the original.

Thus, a story featuring James T. Kirk in the Star Fleet universe on the Star Ship Enterprise with its crew as seen on TV is derivative, because without those elements the story makes no sense.

However, writing a story about a Starship captain with an alien first-officer and a cranky doctor, with no mention of the ST universe.,that's not a derivative work.

Just as an aside, notice that all Star Trek merchandise and stories are copyrighted and trademarked according to Star Trek The Movie. That's because when the copyright for the ST episode came up for renewal, the lawyer renewed only the first two years of the series and missed the third (because the original studio for the ST series was purchased by Paramont before the third year started and the lawyer didn't think to check. This threw the entire third year scripts into the Public Domain). However, when someone went to release the third year without Paramont's permission, Paramont pointed out that they still had all the BACKGROUND sounds on copyright from the first two years, and those would have to be edited out. Thus, the third season has not been released by a third party. Too much work.

I don't think this is an actual legal test, particularly since it requires the court to assess whether a story is "good".

In the The Star Trek case, sounds and such are forms of /expression/ and are therefore generally copyrightable, whereas characters and settings in literature are /ideas/, which generally aren't.

That said, /Warner Bros. Inc. v. American Broadcasting Co./ seems to imply that characters are copyrightable, so it looks like that has been tested in court after all. This is unfortunate.

***** By "good" I meant the story wasn't an apparent random set of sentences without a coherent set of characters or plot. I'm pretty sure that everyone can agree that a story where the main protagonist and every reference to him has been removed (without any attempt at rewriting), the story falls apart. For example, take the Star Trek episode. "City on the Edge of Forever" and remove every reference to Kirk and Spock. Would you have a "good" story left? Or would it look like the ramblings of what might be an idea for a story?

If the story you write depends on an element or elements from the original story in order for it to be considered ready for publishing without requiring arewrite, then your story is a derivative.

** No. It has no legal effect whatsoever. Writing fanfiction is a very clear breach of copyright. The only question is whether the author/rights holder is willing to allow it or not

Especially for HP, since JKR has come out and endorsed fanfiction openly
