Harry Potter x Scrapped Princess

All "magic" that wizards perform, are in fact effects caused by remnants of past, super high tech human civilization. Cloaked and on high orbit, deep underground, phase shifted out of our dimension. Controlled by quantum entangled connection established by low psy field caused by recessive gene, that creates "wizards".

There is no SoS, but wizards are generally distrusted, and live in seclusion, content with what they heave. Normals at the same time, being [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture][Twenty Minutes into the Future]], unknowingly by the masses, try to get back to the level of advancement they once possessed, guided by secret order that reverse engineers founded remnants.

Finally they have to burry their animosity, and unite to fight the common enemy. The extra dimensional forces that destroyed humanity before; thanks to a traitor; trying to get back, and finish the job. They heave to stop the traitor (Voldiefarts) and his army, before he'll opens the pathway for the new invasion.
