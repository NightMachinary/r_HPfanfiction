I think he says it talking to Harry or it could just be fanfiction somewhere... Any ideas?

Edit: Thanks everyone. I think the question's been answered.


** Chapter 10 HBP:

#+begin_quote
  I make mistakes like the next man. In fact, being -- forgive me--rather cleverer than most men, my mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger.

** Well, I don't think it was phrased exactly like this, but didn't he say this to Harry in Canon during the train station scene in Deathly Hallows.

** Dumbledore says similar things when talking to Harry in the one of the last chapters of Deathly Hallows.

When Harry is knocked out(?) by Voldemort's Avada Kadavra curse in the forbidden forest. Harry goes in a void space, and then Dumbledore comes to talk to him and explains certain things to him. During that time he says since I'm more intelligent and powerful, my mistakes have a far greater impact on people's lives. This is in regards to Sirius's death.
