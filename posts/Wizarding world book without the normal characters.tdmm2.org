** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra_Quick_and_the_Thorn_Circle][Alexandra Quick]] comes to mind. Three completed novels and a fourth on the way. I've only finished the first two, but they're fairly original. The only caveat is they take place in America; the author tries to make a sort of New World magical culture.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1374917/Inverarity][The same author]] has a solid [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/Hogwarts_Houses_Divided][Teddy Lupin-Hogwarts OCs]] story too.

**** Yeah, Inverarity is one of the most disciplined fic writers I've come across. Finishes the books, edits them, then posts chapters on a schedule. The effort really pays off in story (not to mention writing) quality.

** The [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4380964/1/Albus_Potter_and_the_Dungeon_of_Merlins_Mist][Albus Potter series]] by Vekin87 would fit. It follows Harry's son through his time at Hogwarts and turns into a pretty big series.

*** Just started reading this. It seems like halfway through the first chapter, it's going to be a mirror image of Harry, except with different names. Do you think this is the case at all?

**** It's like that early on in the series, but after the first one or two books, when the main story starts to kick in, you can see that Albus is very different. So it can be a bit of a slog through some of the early parts of the series, but in my opinion it was worth it by the time you past it.

** I'm writing one about people who go to Hogwarts right after the books: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8025254/1/Darren_Tau_and_the_Golems_Heart][Darren Tau and the Golem's Heart]].

** I've had a little saga sketched up in my notebook for a while now that has to do with a setting that is many years after Harry and everyone dies of old age. It would follow OCs of course and I know some people dislike that which is what has put me off on writing it. If I ever get around to starting it after I finish planning I'll be sure to link you to it.

** I could suggest a few; are you more interested in Post-Hogwarts stories or one involving Next Gen kids like James and Albus and the bunch? Are you looking for something like the original books and something on the longer end?
