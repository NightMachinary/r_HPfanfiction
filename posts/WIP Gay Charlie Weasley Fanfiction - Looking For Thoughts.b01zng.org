So, full disclosure, I'm not an active member of the Harry Potter fandom (my username probably gives that away), or for that matter an experienced fanfic writer, but I've had an idea rattling around in my head for a while now that I really wanted to channel into something and that idea is a gay reading of Charlie Weasley.

There's not a whole lot to back this reading up in the text really, mostly because Charlie is such a minor character in the grand scheme of things. Still, something about the cool older brother who lives conveniently far away from his traditional family and who stands out in a story full of unnecessary information about romantic lives for having no mention of a wife or girlfriend at any point just feels, y'know. Gay.

SO I started writing this fic as an exploration of this idea through a series of vignettes of Charlie's life, and as it's my first Harry Potter fanfiction, I hoped this subreddit might be able to give a little feedback. Below is the introduction - let me know what you think? I'm especially interested in knowing if this idea and the intro is something that would pique your interest if you were looking for fic, or if it's a little too niche to post publicly and get much response. [I think it's okay to post fic WIPs here, but again, I'm new to this, so let me know if that's not what this subreddit is for]

  The dawn light shone yellow through the dirty windows, illuminating the dust specks swirling through the air of Charlie's dingy little flat. A thin film of grime had settled over everything in the room, from the faded, peeling-paint table he was sitting at to the surface of his coffee, giving it a dismal and somewhat unappetizing look. He took a long sip of the coffee anyways. Waking up this early took its toll.

  A tremor ran through his hand as he set the coffee back down, sloshing it slightly over the edges. He clenched and unclenched his fist, willing the shakes to go away. They always did, once he'd been awake long enough, but he hated those few minutes when he couldn't stop the little twitches and convulsions flaring up throughout his body. He'd tried Healers before, but they all told him just to wait and see if it went away on its own. Twenty-one years hadn't made them go away on their own, but he wasn't about to tell them how to do their jobs.

  He gulped down the last of the coffee, feeling the caffeine begin to jolt and shudder his body to a functional state. It took longer to wake up in the mornings now, and he had the distinct feeling it was only downhill from this point. God, he never thought he'd get this old, but here he was. Forty-six would have seemed ancient not too long ago.

  His musings were interrupted by the creaking of the wood floor behind him as a yawning man stumbled his way into the room behind him. He laced his arms around him from behind, nuzzling into Charlie's warmth.

  “Morning, old man,” he muttered into his ear, morning breath blowing into Charlie's face.

  He clasped his hand over the ones resting on his stomach. “Morning, Naseem.”

  Naseem gave him a peck on the cheek before pulling away to go sit at the table. Charlie turned to look at him. He was almost the same age as him, and yet he barely looked over thirty- his sandy brown skin was wrinkled and creased in just a few places around the eyes, and he was only now beginning to have a few strands of silver in his silky black hair. He gave Charlie a sleepy little smile, stretching his back as he sat down in one of their creaky wooden chairs.

  Charlie poured some water into the kettle and set it to boil- Naseem hated the taste of coffee. Over at the table, he was giving Charlie a concerned little look, his brow creasing with worry. “Bad dreams again?”

  He shot a grin over his shoulder. “Nothing that bad, love. Just hard to shake the habit of getting up early.”

  It wasn't entirely a lie. It /was/ difficult to stop getting up early after decades of waking up at dawn to feed the dragons. Still, Naseem must have seen the continuing tremors in his hands. He must have known that wasn't the only thing that drove him out of bed before the sun.

  “We're on holiday, Charlie, you're allowed to sleep in,” he chided fondly, apparently letting the lie slide.

  “Ah, but then who'd wake you up? We'd lie in bed all day and never get anything done.”

  “Mm. There's worse things.”

  The kettle whined, and he poured out a cup, adding a bag of chai and enough milk to turn it the nutty brown Naseem preferred, and he brought it to him as he joined him at the table.

  Naseem took the tea gratefully and smiled, briefly, before his expression turned more serious. He reached his hand out to rest on top of Charlie's, his darker, slender fingers contrasted with Charlie's own pale and calloused palms.

  “I've meaning to talk to you, love. I didn't want to spring it on you like this, it's just, well. This is the last day before we leave, so I don't suppose I can put off asking any longer.” He gave Charlie a soft look, almost apologetic, and squeezed his hand.

  “I want to tell your family about us.”

** I actually just finished a too long comment about something that may help you. Here are some excerpts with bold text to remould them into a more interpersonal story.

*This would be changed to alter the external abilities to internal accomplishments in a story like you're describing.*

1) The idea that your story needs to center around an ability. I can appreciate stories exploring the whatifs about Naruto having certain bloodlines, but they should always be supplementary. One example of this is Devil's Advocate where Naruto gets some dope plant powers, but they are developed slowly, e.g. naturally, and aren't in any way the focus of the story. They are an externalization of the internal struggles Naruto faces. The abilities for this Naruto are just incredibly balanced and well done. There is a significant amount of time before even the idea of Naruto using Ability X comes to the imagination during which it is introduced as something to gloss over.

*For Charlie, this could be some injury gained from his job. A good author writes physical ailments that are really mental ones.*

If Naruto has the Sharingan, it should be a natural extension of the story. It should in some way be directly tied to the way he sees the world. Zuko from ATLA has a burn scar on his eye because the way he sees the world is disfigured by his indoctrination in the *Fire* Nation. Kakashi has a sharingan because it is what ties him to the past. A constant reminder of the mistakes he has made. And when he finally forgives himself for these mistakes, he loses the Sharingan because he now lives in the present without the slow effect given by the sharingan. That idea should apply to any eye ability. We even have a direct damn example in the actual show that no fanfiction has ever seemed to understand.

*I can't stress this enough. Make the characters fleshed out with their own desires if you want us to care.*

3) These people aren't one dimensional. That rogue Shinobi you killed had a wife and family waiting for him. This is especially prominent in Gato. A story where Gato is making money to be greedy allows the heroes to kill him without thought. A story where Gato is pushed to make money by his own childhood of poverty to ensure that his two lovely daughters never suffer as he did would stop quite a few kunai. I imagine that Naruto, the kid living in poverty, would greatly empathize with Gato in this scenario which opens may character doors. Does he forsake his own dreams to do as the mission says? Does he leave these children to live in poverty as orphans just like him? No matter what he chooses here, the story will be much more fleshed out and revealing of the characters involved.

*Any roadblock to their relationship should ultimately serve to push the story where you want it to go.*

4) The story serves the protagonist. The antagonists must be a challenge to Naruto, or whoever, in a very direct way that has nothing to do with strength. Haku, Gaara, and Neji were foils to Naruto which had nothing to do with their strength. It was the way their worldviews clashed that made us love them. Even if Gaara vs Lee had brilliant choreography, the battles have to be more than just "Oh dear this dude is strong and naruto fought him in canon so we better make the two fight even if the weight of the fight means nothing."

*A relationship takes development. If you're really hoping for a masterpiece, then there should be time between strangers, aquaintance, friend, good friend, no homo friend, yes homo friend, step five, step 8, lovers, etc*

5) When the writer doesn't carefully look at what they're doing. There is a sequence that should be met that lets something be great. Madara was an epic reveal because there was so much leading up to him. Don't skip the steps.

*Don't make your story something you don't want it to be. Decide what you want your story to be and then decide how detailed/developed it can be.*

8) When people criticize a story wrongly. I wouldn't make points #3 and #4 if I were reading a crack fic. I would complain about the lack of development if the story was based on a few friends jamming at the club. I wouldn't say Devil's Advocate sucks because the Naruto isn't godlike. Different stories have different goals. A story meant to entertain and casually read between video games shouldn't be put on the same scales as a tragedy meant to cause the reader to evaluate their own lives. I love analyzing stories and reviewing them, but it would just be unfair to put all the criteria I've mentioned here against every type of story. That isn't any excuse not to consider the story you're aiming for and how to go about it, but it is telling you to carefully examine what your goals for writing the story are. Before I write anything even a single one shot, I make a decently long essay about the purpose and ways in how the various things will change the MC to let them face the final threat. Consider doing the same if you really want to explore your own psychology and reasons for writing.

*** Thanks for the feedback! I've actually got a fairly significant amount of the story written at this point, so I'm past a lot of the plotting steps, but I definitely do hope to hit these points, particularly on fleshing out the side characters and keeping a clear goal on the story. The main focus is on Charlie and his history leading up to the relationship seen in the introduction, but making not just him but also the original character he's in a relationship with people that any reader would give a shit about is def something I gotta keep in mind so thanks for pointing that out
