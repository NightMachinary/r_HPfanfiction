:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
All I can remember is Harry is determined to get wizards and witches away from muggles and builds all magic villages/towns and tries to get everyone to move to them. I think they pass laws to make it illegal to go into the muggle world, and they have designated wizard areas that they have to be in by a certain date. And build train tracks to travel between them? It might also be time travel.

** Do you remember the pairing? It sounds a little like Xerosis by Batsutousai. It is a HP/TMR where Harry is MoD and goes back to his younger self to save the Wizarding world from Muggles.

There is another similar to Xerosis where Harry controls villages before he goes back in time to try to stop it. I will try to find it.

*** I can't remember the pairing, I'm not sure there was one tbh. It's not xerosis, though I do like that one. Thank you.
