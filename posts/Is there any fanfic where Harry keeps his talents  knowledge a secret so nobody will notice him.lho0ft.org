Maybe a WBWL story, nobody is interested in Harry Potter and he keeps a low profile but in fact he's a prodigy like Voldemort in classes.


** This doesn't fit your request for WBWL, and many people seem to dislike this story due to either its conclusion or the premise in general, but I thoroughly enjoy "Quoth the Raven, Nevermore" by GenkaiFan. Harry is basically hidden away and trained until it's time for him to go to Hogwarts, and when he finally does get there, he conceals his true nature and his talent with exception to the Triwizard Tournament.

Slightly more towards what you're looking for is "Harry Potter: The Forgotten Brother" by sprinter1988. It is post-Hogwarts but is actually WBWL and Harry's ability was hidden from most everyone for the entirety he was at Hogwarts.

"Who Dares Wins" by OlgeGunnarsson is WBWL, but it starts with The Battle of The Department of Mysteries. I'm not convinced he is technically prodigy over being trained instead, but if the idea is he is better than his brother I certainly think it fits what you're looking for. It is currently ongoing with the last update being November of 2020 as of this post.

  The Tower of London has a dark and bloody past both in the muggle and wizarding worlds. Besides being a prison, it also served as a sanctuary in times past, what if it became one yet again? -AU

  For years, the world has hailed Arnold Potter as the Boy-Who-Lived. For years Arnold was said to be the one who will throw down Voldemort. But now Arnold is dead, and the world turns its attentions to Harry. Mostly H/Hr/L. Finished.

  A Harry Potter who grew up studying military tactics and strategy uses the attack on the Ministry as an opportunity to lay an ambush of his own - only to learn that his parents are still alive, as well as a twin brother whom Dumbledore calls the true boy-who-lived. And then, things get complicated. Military!Harry. A subversion of DZ2's Prodigal Son Challenge.

** I remember a fic where a secretly superpowerful Harry was sent to Azkaban in his fifth year, but planted a doppelganger in his stead. Unfortunately, it was deleted as far as I can tell; looking among K+ pre-OotP Harmony fics doesn't appear to show it.

Never mind, found it. The fanfiction.net copy seems to be gone, a couple of others are still there.
