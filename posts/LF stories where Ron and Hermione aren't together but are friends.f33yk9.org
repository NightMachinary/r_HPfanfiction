Maybe they tried and it failed, maybe they never fell in love with each other, or fell out of love with each other.

So, no bashing from either character please.

Can be on ANY site

Anyone can be the main character

It doesn't have to be the major thing in the story.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine

No Harem or Lord Potter please.


** That's the standard for those of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/Starfox5][my stories]] in which Harry and Hermione are together.

*** Can you list me any of those? I tend to stay away from Harry/Hermione, just because Ron is often bashed.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Having been raised by his tomb raiding aunt, Harry Potter had known early on that he'd follow in her footsteps and become a Curse-Breaker, discovering and exploring old tombs full of lost knowledge and treasure. But he and his two best friends might have underestimated just how dangerous the wrong sort of knowledge and treasure could be. Sequel to "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider".

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  "It's a veritable PTSD tour. With pastries. And hand-skimmed clotted cream. And Hermione has no idea why she's doing it, but it's becoming very apparent that she is." Sometimes you're sad. Sometimes you need dessert. And sometimes, it's a little of both. [COMPLETE, DRAMIONE]

** linkffn(5125378) Ron and Hermione are on really good terms here. I don't want to give anything away, but Hermione is the main character and Ron is a very competent secondary character in this story.
