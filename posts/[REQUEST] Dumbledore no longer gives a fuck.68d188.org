I finally got around to reading linkffn(Itachi, is that a baby?) which has the most hilarious Dumbledore I've ever read. Any other good stories with a good zero-fucks-given Dumbledore? I'd rather not read slash or [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants][Draco in leather pants]], but other than that I don't really care what's in the story.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10287864/1/Biting-the-Hand-That-Feeds-You][Biting the Hand that Feeds You]] is the only other one I've been able to find, though Dumbledore doesn't show up for a while.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.

  Fred and George pull a massive prank at Hogwarts and dose all the dining hall food with Veritaserum. Chaos and hilarity ensues.

Sorry, nothing comes to mind for me. You can imagine Dumbledore singing the above if you like, though.
