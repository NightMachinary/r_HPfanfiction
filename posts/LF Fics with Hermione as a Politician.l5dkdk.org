I'm looking for fics that focus on Hermione playing politics. I'm alright with any government position for as long the politics is a significant part of both the plot and her characterization. I'm fine with any pairing, rating, etc. No bashing please.

  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.
