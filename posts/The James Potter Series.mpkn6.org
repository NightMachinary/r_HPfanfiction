** "First of all these stories are not about the Marauders."

Such a huge disappointment.

*** I was too initially but I've been reading them and they actually are quite good. Every now and then I'll forget I'm reading a fan created story because the arcs are pretty complex. It started out with almost too big of a big bad yet turned it around quickly. I need to finish the second one still but so far I'm hooked.
