:END:
I have read a Harry potter fanfic a few years ago, where Harry Potter won the war but still lost every one except Luna Lovegood, with Her help she sends Harry Potter to another reality that hasn't finished the war with Voldemort, and where he can find true happiness, that happiness turns out to be with the new realities Harry Potter, The traveling harry changes his name to Orion, in Orion's world peter was not the traitor Remus was, in the new reality peter was the death eater. And by the way can be considered a slash story between Harry potter and Harry potter(from the other world).
