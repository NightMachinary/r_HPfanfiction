Hey guys,

got another request here: Fanfictions containing a competent and usefull Order of the Phoenix!

- so at best Molly (and similar people) is not a member (sorry, what does an overbearing helicopter-mom housewife bring to the table? The only "combat training" (and I use the term very losely here!) she has had was Defense against the Dark Arts at Hogwarts (!), which is not much and every other witch or wizard has had that, too!), same for Mundungus Fletcher (a thief is great for information gathering in places respectable people don't go, but having said thief as a trusted member of your secret society is plain stupidity IMHO!)

- they don't only gather information (information they don't act on in most cases)

- they check their members for compulsions etc. (and have them submit to veritaserum) before allowing them in (and they repeat this at random intervalls to weed out traitors!)

- they do train members that are no good (so if Molly etc. are on board? Well, they'll have Moody or somebody like him train them - HARD!)

etc. etc. :)

Thanks and once again, please:

- NO SLASH (secondary characters would be acceptable, but not Harry/Draco or Lucius or Tom Riddle or Snape etc. etc.)
- No totally illogical pairings like: Hermione/Draco (they hate each other and he wouldn't "dirty himself" by touching her!), Hermione/Ron (even Rowling admits that this pairing is pure wish fullfilment...more like a fanfiction than what should have happened!) etc. etc.
- No Harry/Ginny :(

Thanks for "listening" and thanky you for your help in advance! - the stage is your's guys :)

Well, she killed Bellatrix and Bellatrix dealt with Shackelbolt in a matter of seconds. Seems like bringing plenty to the table for me.

Just because Rowling never mentioned Hogwart's Dormitory bathrooms, doesn't mean that they don't exist, it was just likely a detail she wanted to leave out. Similarly, Harry states several things about Magic that Rowling never specifically states in narrations as well, showing that there are several things we don't know about the Potterverse Magic.

I'm not sure how casting powerful spells is multitasking.

#+end_quote

What? We know that you need to want to make somebody suffer to cast Crucio, but AFAIR there is nothing about other Unforgivables being similar in this matter. Also, it's caster's emotions that make spell work and not a spell forcing emotions on the caster.

Which means that they are mentioned in text. We don't need repeating of the same information.

#+end_quote

Of course, many of them. We can only theorise about things based on what we were shown. And we weren't shown anything implying magical exhaustion exist despite events like fight in DoM, and attacks on Hogwarts in sixth and seventh books where a lot of people were throwing a lot of spells around.

Duelling takes the ability to multitask, and if the Battle in the Department of Ministries is anything to go by, she takes on multiple opponents at once usually.

It still becomes like muscle memory at some point, you don't really need to forcefully push it out, it just exists there when you need it. Moody's words about the Killing Curse seem to suggest a requirement of sorts to it.

Obviously, I was talking about how magic in the Potterverse is relatively unknown to us.

**** I don't see the appeal of Ron. He is a deserter (coming back later does not change shit) which says a lot about his character. He deserted them twice in a time of need.

He never tried to understand his friends but was jealous of Harry's wealth and fame to the point where he did not believe him about the tournament while having delusions of grandeur (like that he would be the best Hogwarts student in the goblet). He made fun of Hermione because she understood what School is about. He was hurtful towards Hermione for most of the books with his near death experience being one of the few exceptions. You don't get together with the guy who made your life difficult for years and showed that he runs if things get uncomfortable.

Yes, Harry treated Hermione bad occasionally but he has the valid excuse of a traumatizing upbringing that realistically would leave him nearly unable to function socially and also had the leader of the magical terrorist after his arse for most of the time.

Basically, Ron is a necessary member of the trio, his biggest quality is (oft-overlooked in fanfics) humor, and he's the most human/relatable of the three, for better or worse.

*** I am NOT misrepresenting her words, she said that she only put them together to stick with the original plan (so she, by that point, knew that they were NOT a good fit! I am not saying that Harry and Hermione are an ideal fit either, but it would be better than Ron and Hermione!

SPEW was a stupid idea though, that was the point. Also, you clearly misremember the books.

  ‘“Spew”?' said Harry, picking up a badge and looking at it. ‘What's this about?' ‘Not spew,' said Hermione impatiently. ‘It's S -- P -- E -- W. Stands for the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare.'

  ‘Never heard of it,' said Ron.

  ‘Well, of course you haven't,' said Hermione briskly, ‘I've only just started it.'

  ‘Yeah?' said Ron in mild surprise. ‘How many members have you got?'

  ‘Well -- if you two join -- three,' said Hermione.

  ‘And you think we want to walk around wearing badges saying “spew”, do you?' said Ron. ‘S -- P -- E -- W!' said Hermione hotly. ‘I was going to put Stop the Outrageous Abuse of Our Fellow Magical Creatures and Campaign for a Change in Their Legal Status -- but it wouldn't fit. So that's the heading of our manifesto.'

  She brandished the sheaf of parchment at them. ‘I've been researching it thoroughly in the library. Elf enslavement goes back centuries. I can't believe no one's done anything about it before now.' ‘Hermione -- open your ears,' said Ron loudly. ‘They. Like. It. They like being enslaved!'

  (...)

  There was a pause in which Hermione beamed at the pair of them, and Harry sat, torn between exasperation at Hermione, and amusement at the look on Ron's face.

  True, both of them had paid two Sickles for a S.P.E.W. badge, but they had only done it to keep her quiet. Their Sickles had been wasted, however; if anything, they seemed to have made Hermione more vociferous. She had been badgering Harry and Ron ever since, firstly to wear the badges, then to persuade others to do the same, and she had also taken to rattling around the Gryffindor common room every evening, cornering people and shaking the collecting tin under their noses

Yeah, clearly Harry is a much greater fan of the idea than Ron.

Also speaking of wish-fulfilment aspect of Ron-Hermione relationship. Hermione is Rowling's self-insert, Ron is based on her close friend. I have a good guess about what kind of wish-fulfilment that was.
