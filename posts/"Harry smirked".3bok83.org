You can breathe through your mouth while kissing. Its really not that hard, given that your partner refrained from eating garlic and onions.

** Following a brief scan of the books, I can say that Harry has smirked on more than one occasion, though never as often as Draco Malfoy, Snape or the Weasley twins. Ron has him beat by a handful of wry teasing half-smiles, and even Hermione has been known to exhibit an expression of schadenfreude.

It is the face of taunt, and one can expect an empowered Harry (often encountered in fanfiction) to have more cause for lording his quick wit over others. Certainly moreso than canon cork-in-the-ocean Harry.

Harry smirks three times. Ron smirks three or four times. Hermione has two smirks, but never alone. The twins have about six smirks between them. Snape gets maybe a dozen, while Malfoy is well over twenty. That's out of 1.1 million words.

**** He says 'my dear boy' to Harry at least seven times, but he's not alone in that. It's a common enough phrase for Harry used by Slughorn, Trelawney, Hagrid, Minister Fudge, Minister Scrimgeour... Dumbledore even refers to Draco as 'my dear boy' and Tom Riddle gets it several times from Headmaster Dippet and Hepzibah Smith. It's something of a Rowling-ism.

**** I really love terrible fanfictions. I search them out.

I think my favorite was one where Itachi was Merlin.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8013278/1/Eye-of-the-Beholder][This one]]

Heres what his wand is made of:\\
1. a Unicorn who gave two drops of its blood freely to him;\\
2. an Akki that gave him a fang after being defeated;\\
3. a Ningyo gifting him one of its pearl tears after he resisted its allure;\\
4. and finally the hair of the Grand Elf when Harry had been pulled into their realm during his sleep.\\
5. "Twelve and three sixtieth inches," he explained, getting a raised eyebrow at the precise measurement, "made of my femur bone after I had been bitten by a Nudu."

And he'd had twenty sorcerers helping him with it. At age 8.

So bad I could never get pass chapter 6...but one of the most remarkable experiences of my life.

** Here's my favorite (read:least favorite). Do this google search:

*site:fanfiction.net snape "coal black eyes"*

In return you'll offered 73,200 search results and /free nightmares./

Some choice samples:

/Snape's coal-black eyes slid slowly to the left, wordlessly taking/ ~ /Snape snapped. His coal black eyes bore into the headmaster's/ ~ /Snape's coal black eyes looked into Harry's bright green eyes and he saw her/ ~ /Snape's coal black eyes hit me/ ~ /A salty tear leaked out of Snape's coal black eyes/ ~ /Snape's coal-black eyes began to glimmer/ ~ /Panting, Harry stared up into the coal black eyes/

What was that again?

Coal black eyes. *73,200 instances of COAL BLACK EYES silently swiveling as they are snugly set against their milky white backdrop*

In case it isn't clear, irises are usually brown, blue, or piercing green (if your name is Harry Potter). Black eyes would be irises the same color as the pupil. A coal black eye would be a featureless black circle against the white of the sclera.

No wonder the students hate Snape. I think you could write a compelling/horrifying story just by stringing together quotes about Snape's coal black eyes. . . . . . Bonus round!

/Coal black eyes, surprisingly soft, looked down at me as Snape reached into.../ ~ /His coal black eyes bore a serious message. "You will".../ ~ /as her teacher stared at her, his coal black eyes daring her to continue.../ ~ /His coal-black eyes reflected the pale light of the nearly full moon above them. "I promise, I won't hurt you/ ~ /meeting the coal black eyes unwillingly, scared that Snape would delve.../ (Delving, is that what it's called these days?) ~ /Snape looked at the centaur with his coal black eyes, "Stay..."/

I'm not sure what was going on in the last quote. I wasn't brave enough to follow the link.
