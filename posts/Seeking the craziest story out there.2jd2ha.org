I want to read a psycho harry story. Good, bad, grey, sane, insane. Doesnt matter. As long as he is crazy as hell.

Only thing im not a fan of is slash. If itd well written thats a bonus too.


** Have you read Bungle in the Jungle?

Or, it is really really weird and R rated, but I liked Harry Johnson and the Headmaster's Socks

*** Second Bungle in the Jungle.

Contains a powerful Harry, though the POV it's written in is unusual for a fic.

**** yeah, the second person narrator is a bit weird at first but you get used to it. The OP Harry on the other way, not so much, and the female characters are all cardboards.

** Both [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5460511/1/Ambient][Ambient]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3468902/1/Demon-s-Feign-Merlin-s-Pain][Demon's Feign, Merlin's Pain]] had a pretty insane Harry though the latter is a crossover. The most insane would probably be from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3127161/1/Blessed][Blessed]] though. He starts out pretty normal and sane but by the end he's a complete nutcase.

** On mobile so hopefully some other kind soul can link it for me, but Lens of Sanity's "An Old and New World" has a grey/dark Harry witha pretty unique outlook on things. Be warned though, it is complete crack, although the plot isnt bad for how crazy it is.

** Mede's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4810036/1/On-a-Train-Switching-Tracks][On a Train, Switching Tracks]] perhaps?

  "Celebrities," Harry said. "Fame makes them mad. I take it the wizarding world doesn't really have them, then?" Draco and Ron exchanged glances. "No, not really."

Also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4086213/1/Lost-Hope][Lost Hope]] by Adari may qualify (though the whole world is insane in a Thomas Pynchon novel sense).

  The plan was perfect. The execution was even better...but they all forgot to consult the Sorting Hat who had its own views. After all, what can you expect from the hat which contains all four founders?
