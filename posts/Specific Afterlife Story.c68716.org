:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for a very specific story, I read it literally 4/5 years ago and have never found it since.

All I remember was it was an afterlife story about Lily, James and everyone, and everyone had a house, and it was about them watching over harry and their reactions to everything he got up to.

The only specific detail I remember was them using toasters to send messages???

If anyone vaguely recalls this please let me know!
