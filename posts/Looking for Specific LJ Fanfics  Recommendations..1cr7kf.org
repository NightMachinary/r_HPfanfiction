Background: I started reading fanfiction about 10 years ago. I've used fanfiction.net, harrypotterfanfiction.net, and the very old mugglenet.com fanfic site (which has changed drastically.) First of all, *if you know any other wonderful sites, please let me know!*

I'm looking for two specific stories in particular, and since it's been quite awhile I've forgotten most of the details. I only read LJ.

Story 1: Probably in the angst category. (+Doesn't everyone have those angsty young teenage years where you spend all day locked in your room, reading fanfiction and listening to Simple Plan?+ Okay, maybe not everyone.) James has a little sister who died (not during the fanfic.) She was wearing her mother's robes and dancing around by a fireplace, catches on fire and dies. Tragic. James walks into the room while Lily is dancing around by the fire and he has an absolute freak out moment, and she comforts him. That's all I can remember, but I *really* want to read this one again! Any one remember this story or other parts of it?

Story 2: Lily has brothers. Either a twin brother and an older brother, or twin older brothers or something like that. I'm pretty sure one or more of them end up dying at Hogwarts. I think they're muggle, but maybe magical? It's been so long. Sorry, I can't remember any more than that....

I tend to read fics that are 100,000+ words. However, once I finish those I'll move to 40,000+ so it could be anything above that. Any advice is so very welcome and appreciated.

Also (if I'm allowed to ask this?), I'd love some suggestions for good (preferably completed) LJ fanfics. Only 40,000+ words, please. Thanks!


** In terms of websites, I go to [[http://crack-broom.livejournal.com/][Crack Broom]] and [[http://mujaji.net/kia/][Know it Alls]] for my fic recs. I find they pretty much consistently have high quality, well written fics.

** I unfortunately don't know what those two fics are called, but I'd love to recommend "A Month of Sundays" by marziipan (located on ffnet; I'd link to it but my phone is being lame about that currently). It's one of my favorite LJ stories ever. :)

** [[http://fanfiction.mugglenet.com/viewuser.php?uid=46901][This author]] has two really long L/J fics and some really nice supplementary ones as well.

** I'm really particular with fanfiction. I can't read anything that isn't Canon. That being said, however, I've found some really good ones over the years. My favorite Lily and James story is [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5200789/1/The-Life-and-Times][The Life and Times]] by Jules. It's super long and kind of reads like an episodic TV show. She's still not done, too (although we are getting close to the end). It's the only fanfiction story I've ever read twice.

** [[http://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/khk06/fan_fiction_how_to_separate_good_ones_from_the/][This is my standard fic rec comment (fanfiction recommendation):]]

[[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?chapno=1&storyid=619][After the End by Arabella and Zsenya]] - Definitely one of the greats. It was started after /GoF/ and the epilogue was published the night /OotP/ was released. It's twice as long as /OotP/. It's one of the most faithful characterizations I've ever come across and was a totally plausible ending for what we knew at the time. Brilliantly written and you fall in love with the characters again.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650][Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always]] - One of the best [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail][For Want of a Nail]] fics out there. It all goes horribly wrong by the end and the only survivors are Harry, Ron, and Ginny. Nearly suicidal in their depression, they find a way to go back in time to make sure everyone survives. Make sure you read Parts II and III as well, although III hasn't been touched in 2 years.

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/barb/HPATPS.html][Barb LP's Psychic Serpent Trilogy]] - Another post-/GoF/ that covers Harry's last 3 years, I'm hesitant to suggest this. It's wonderfully written for the most part, but I've always felt there was a touch /too much/ personal drama in the relationships, as if she forgot they were just teenagers. But where the series shines is how very /British/ it feels. You get a much stronger sense of the geography and culture of the British Isles that I feel makes it worth the read. Also her oneshots [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/barb/MATB01.html][Mad About the Boy]] and [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/barb/HAH01.html][Horntails and Hippogriffs]] are /delightful/ and give you the fuzzies.

[[http://www.phoenixsong.net/fanfiction/stories.php?psid=2422][The F Words Series by Antosha]] - Taking place and published immediately after the last chapter of /DH/ (but before the epilogue), these are some of the most amazing fics I've ever read. You get to see the characters pull themselves together again after the Battle of Hogwarts. The next time you finish reading /DH/, start reading the series and prepare to have the bittersweet feeling held at bay for a mite longer. Although really everything by this author is amazing. His characterizations are always spot-on and his Luna is probably the best you'll find aside from Rowling's canon.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Methods_of_Rationality][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]] - If you haven't read this, you need to do so immediately. The hands-down most hilarious and brilliant fanfic to come out in years. From the description: "Petunia married a professor, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter... " This should be required reading for everyone.

There are more that I could suggest but I think these represent the very best in terms of story, character, and writing. Plus it's hard to come up with these lists.

If you just type in "fanfiction" or "fanfic" or "fan fiction" or "fan-fiction" in the search reddit box to the right, you'll find more threads.

--------------

As far as sites go, I'll second the recommendations for [[http://www.checkmated.com/][checkmated]] and [[http://www.simplyundeniable.com/][simplyundeniable]]. I'll also add [[http://sugarquill.net/][The Sugarquill]] (one of the earliest R/H repositories), [[http://www.phoenixsong.net/][PhoenixSong]] (which rose from the ashes of the great GryffindorTower), and [[http://www.thequidditchpitch.org/][thequidditchpitch]]. Fanfiction.net is like youtube: 99% crap; but there are still some real gems in there if you know where to look. Usually you can cut a lot of the crap by fiddling with the filters (rating>all, books only, word count > 100k, character pairings optional)

[[http://fanlore.org/wiki/Harry_Potter][Also, here's a good overview of the fandom's history for those that weren't around for it.]]

Ninja edit: I forgot a really good one! [[http://mujaji.net/kia/][Know It Alls]] is a fanfiction recommendation site (fic recs) that's got consistently high quality links. You can even sort by pairings or protagonists or eras using the tags.
