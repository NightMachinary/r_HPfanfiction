It can de a crossover if necessary I found a good one that was a game of thrones Harry Potter crossover than had a lot of quidditch but some like the The lie I've lived. With a lot more detail, anything with Harry or Ginny, or even Oliver or playing professional quidditch works as well

  From Hogwarts' historic pitch to the famous stadiums of Europe, Harry fights to earn his place amongst the all-time greats. The stakes are high, and sheer talent is never enough. It's more than just a game. A Quidditch story.
