I have just started wading my way into post war era fics, and I am interested in fics where Harry struggles to juggle postwar obligations, adulthood, Ginny, and of course being a Godfather to Teddy Lupin when he is essentially still a kid himself.

Would love to see Andromeda play a big part in these stories as well.

**** In order to protect Teddy, he is willing to burn down the establishment in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167). On the other hand, his relationship with Ginny fails, although she remains loyal and a friend to him.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4453643/JacobApples][JacobApples]] has some stories with this concept. In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12813755/1/The-Disorder-of-the-Phoenix][The Disorder of the Phoenix]] Harry takes Teddy and Andromeda to America to escape the pressure in Britain; and 7 years later thrown back to 1995. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12952598/1/What-We-Lost][What We Lost]] shows Harry grow closer to Andromeda while taking care of Teddy together, I haven't read this this one but I heard it's good. The author is dyslexic, so be ready to find some grammar and spelling mistake.

If you don't mind teenager Teddy, there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7583506/1/Letters][Letters]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4809356/1/There-ll-Be-Bluebirds][There ll Be Bluebirds]] both shows an excellent Harry-Teddy relationship while Teddy is discovering the real story of the Second Wizarding War.

Ofcourse there's always the infamous post-war [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4367121/1/The-First-Day][The First Day]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6452485/1/More-Than-Words][More Than Words]] but I don't really remember any significant Harry-Teddy.

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon...
