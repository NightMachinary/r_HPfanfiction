According to the model used by ([[https://dna.frieger.com/calc-quick.php]]) black hair is impossible both of the parents either have black or brown hair.

Harry's mother has red hair, not to mention Ginny does too and James II is implied to have black hair.

Does the answer come down to 'magic' or the complexity of the genome compared to the simplicity of the model?


** ... James's hair is black, Lily's was red, black hair is genetically dominant over red hair, which is recessive. Therefore, Harry's hair is black. Not seeing the problem tbh

Do you know of a black haired child with a blonde or red-headed parent? (Not saying this is impossible, just saying that it would happen more often if this was the expected result.)

** Harry having black hair is entirely possible, it's just that this model is straight up incorrect. Black hair is dominant over brown which is dominant over blonde which is dominant over red. Technically it's entirely possible for Harry to have brown hair assuming James had a brown haired ancestor, but a black haired and red haired parent are in no way restricted to having only brown haired children.

Think about it. 80 percent of the human population has black hair. How would this be maintained if people with black hair couldn't have children with black hair? Are there large colonies of blondes producing hundreds of black haired children each?

*** If two people with black hair have children, according to this model they will have black haired children.

"Are there large colonies of blondes producing hundreds of black haired children each?"

No, because even according to the model they cannot produce a black haired child.

"Black hair is dominant over brown which is dominant over blonde which is dominant over red."

If this is true, then for someone with black hair, half (or all, if they have two black-haired alleles) of their children would have black hair, regardless of the hair of the other parent.

2. James Potter had black hair in the books. It's just one of many things that other sources changed/got wrong.

** His father had black hair and his mother had red hair. In this case the red hair was recessive while the black hair was dominant.

Heck; my older sister and her husband have twins, a girl and a boy; the girl has red hair while the boy has black hair, even though my older sister has dark brown hair and her husband has brown hair; red hair just happened to come up, because we seem to have a red haired person in the family once every generation; and apparently the black hair was dominant instead of brown this time around. It's totally possible.

***** The number of red hair per generation is statistics. Given genes, there's a certain percentage chance of having a red-haired person. All of them could have been red haired.

******** Let's say person A has blonde hair

Person B has black hair

Their kid can have red hair or even brown hair, depending on their family ancestory. Or they could have blond or black, depending on what is the more dominant gene.

It just depends on the family genes, not every family is the same; some genes are more dominant then others; some are more recessive, but then you go to a different family and the genes that were recessive for one family is more dominant to another.

I knew a family that had twins; one was a boy the other a girl. The girl had red hair, the boy had black hair. They had a brother with black hair. I met the parents, the father had black hair and the mother had red hair. So by that the black hair was slightly more dominant, but the red hair was still common enough for the mother and daughter to get it.

My younger sister has blue eyes that sometimes changes to green, depending on what she wears; the blue eyes is because of her father (we have different dads but the same moms).

My older sister and I have dark brown hair, my mom has dark brown hair, my sister had dirty blonde hair growing up; because of the different dads, and because those genes decided to show themselves to my sister.

You actually knew a couple who had the same hair colour as Harry's parents who had a child with black hair? Why didn't you lead with that?

"It just depends on the family genes, not every family is the same; some genes are more dominant then others; some are more recessive, but then you go to a different family and the genes that were recessive for one family is more dominant to another."

I think this might be more inaccurate than either the high school model and the website model.

"My younger sister has blue eyes that sometimes changes to green, depending on what she wears;"

I have a feeling that her eyes just look different in different contexts (similar to the yellow/white/blue/black dress thing) and don't actually change colour. But what do I know?

** Black (‘BL') > Brown (‘Br') > Blonde (‘bl') > Red (r).

Lily has red hair, and the only combination that expresses red is ‘rr'. James has black hair, and the combinations that result in black hair are ‘BLX' where X could be any hair color gene including ‘BL'.

Harry has black hair, so his genes must be ‘BLX'. Since Lily could only pass on an ‘r', we can be certain that Harry has genes ‘BLr', meaning he is black haired and a carrier of the red hair gene. This means Harry's children can have black or red hair.

**** Having one dominant trait and one recessive trait means the dominant gene is expressed.

That is basic though. Reality gets complicated as to what is dominant. But in this case, it is well withing the realm of basic genetics based reasoning.

***** I know what is taught in high school biology classes. It is my understanding, however, that that model is overly simplistic.

For example, if someone who you could reasonably expect to have exclusively BL/BL alleles (such as someone from most African countries and Asian countries) then by your model all children of those would have black hair also. However, that does not seem to be the case. Instead, it seems that nearly all black-haired people who have a children with a blonde-haired person or red-haired person will have brown-haired children.

** Well, my mother has red hair blue eyes and my father has brown/black hair brown eyes. My sister has dark red hair and brown eyes, I have bright red hair and blue eyes. My sister's husband has black hair, they have three children. Black hair, blue-eyed boy. Red-haired brown eyed girl. Brown haired brown eyed girl.

My mother remarried a blonde blue eyed man and had two more children. A blonde with reddish tints and blue-eyed girl and a red haired blue eyed boy.

The Potter genetics were likely possible, and it's not definitively provable either way because you don't have all the details of the other relatives and certainly not their genetic makeup. Also, it's a work of fiction...
