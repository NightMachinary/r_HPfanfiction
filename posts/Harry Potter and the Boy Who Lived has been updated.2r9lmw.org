Did not see this update coming at all!

The FF.net update was some older chapters being posted to FF.net but a /new/ chapter has been updated on the DLP thread [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=17021&page=3][here.]]


** While he only updated the FFN copy with stuff he had written prior on DLP, he did in fact update a /new/ chapter on the DLP WbA thread.

Thread can be found [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=17021&page=3][here]]

**** The WbA forums are purposefully made to be viewable to only members to protect the stuff being posted from being harvested and posted elsewhere. We made that decision a few years ago to offer a modicum of protection to our authors works, generally because things being posted in WbA are not ready to be consumed en masse.

**** I'm honestly not quite sure on the protocol for that. In any case, I'd hesitate to copy and paste another persons work when it's so easily accessible. Just make an account, it took you more time to ask than it would have to sign up.

**** The author's work is posted in a private venue and you want someone to take it and make it public without his consent.

Further, the author already has a public version of the work, which he posts at his own timetable, implying that he makes a clear distinction between the two. By posting the work publicly before the author did so themselves you would be supplanting the official version with your own publication.

And you can't see how this would be a faux pas?

** Man I have no clue what is going on, all I really remember about this story is that I really liked how Durmstrung was set up differently.

** To be fair, it's something that's already been written. He's posted a number of extra chapters in DLP, and this is one of those. But hopefully this indicates there will be more new content coming.

*** Ah crud, I jumped the gun. I could have sworn I read the chapters posted on DLP before, and when I didn't recognize the new chapters I thought they really were new.

Oh well. Like you said hopefully he's still writing.

**** You didn't jump the gun. He posted a new chapter in the WbA thread on DLP.

** It's also received a update on DLP, though it's in the WBA, so you need to be a member to read.

** I like the fact that the new chapter, as suggested in the previous' author notes, now has been posted «around New Years».

** Does anyone know if he did something new with the new FFN stuff he posted? Did he edit it in anyway or added some new content or fillers? I ask this because I remember reading stuff from the FFN one that wasn't on his WbA (like the stuff when he comes home).
