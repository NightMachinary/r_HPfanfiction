Most fucked up Fanfic


** That would be "Holly Evans and the spiral path". Very well written, but absolutely fucked up fanfiction.

** There are multiple kinds. Sure you can find the edgy dark lord Potter who is literally hitler, or the rapey slavery fics, which are also fucked up. But I can't really relate to those, so they don't hit me hard. linkffn(Too Young To Die) was relatable, and engaging enough for me to get emotionally involved with it. If by some chance you haven't read it, it is like an emotional Trainwreck. The main character begins spiraling, flaking down that slippery slope into legitimately evil, all while engaging in highly self-destructive behaviors, for Noble causes and because they believe that they were right. As a reader, if you stop and think about it, it is really quite tragic, and kinda fuck with you emotionally. There is no happy ending.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

  Harry Potter is not like other boys. He's not even like other wizards. Everyone thinks they know the real Harry, but they're wrong. He has a secret even his friends Ron and Hermione don't know about, a secrets that he fears they would never understand or accept about him. But he may have found someone who understands and accepts him completely; someone who shares his secret. (AU)
