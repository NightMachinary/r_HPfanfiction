So I'm having a pretty big dilemma right now and I'm unsure of what to do. The backstory is I started writing fanfictions 2-3 years ago and only started publishing a few of them in March of 2020. Two of them didn't get off to a great start but my third fanfic did and I'm extremely proud of it. However ever since the pandemic started, I've been forced into remote learning (since I'm still a student) and that has been a pain in the ass. The last time I updated was September of 2020 which is like 4 months ago. I feel very guilty for not updating because I promised not to abandon the fanfic but that's basically what I have unintentionally done. Every passing day I think of the fanfiction that I love writing but I just can't feel the motivation or have the courage to continue. Another factor of my hiatus is the amount of stress I get from my daily life and decreased creativity due to school. I've reread my entire fanfic back to front and noticed how terrible my writing was. Some of the old comments on the fanfic that I have long disregarded have come back to haunt me. I don't know what to do. I want to get back to writing fanfictions. I want to feel the same joy I felt when I received tons of beautiful feedback from my readers. I- just don't know what to do. The longer I wait, the more guilty and unmotivated I become. Any help or feedback from you guys will mean the world to me. Thank you.


** As an avid reader of fanfiction, I'm always happy when my favorite fanfictions update even years after. Fanfics are for enjoyment, for both the writer and the reader. Dont be so hard on yourself and take your time, im sure many will be happy to see you come back.

*** I surely do hope so. That's a factor of my guilt, the readers who have avidly supported my throughout my writing process just sitting there wondering where I have gone. Maybe they will lose interest. So when I do come back, who will be there? I won't have the same kind of support that motivated me to write this longfic of 1k followers. I try my best to not be hard on myself so thank u for helping. Hopefully I can go back to writing someday

** That's rough buddy. (Just kidding)

Honestly, if you got to posting something that's pretty impressive on its own (At least in my eyes). Not only are you putting yourself out there, but it seems like a lot of tough work. I keep on trying to write but keep deleting it and rewriting it till its 2 hours later and I only have 200 words. Then any motivation I original had died out.

As to whether you should feel guilty. I really don't know. Some people say write for yourself, but I can imagine the feedback and favorites must be a fun experience. On the flip side, I also can imagine the stress of feeling the need to update.

But in the end its your life, you shouldn't have to bend the knee to other people. It's a bit hypocritical for me to say, but from what I read it seems that you have high expectations for your writing. There is a lot of hot garbage on the internet nobody cares if there is one more piece floating around.

As for motivation to write, for me reading a good fanfic of the certain pairing helps me. After a while it dwindles when I can't form anything of my writing. But that's my take Â¯_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

*** Thank you for your feedback! I appreciate that you took the time to try and help me. I agree with your statement that I shouldn't bend the knee to other people. I'm a relatively shy person so whenever people have opinions of me I feel rather timid and restrained. Fanfiction has been that way out of my shyness because not only can I freely express myself but also because no one knows who I am. (I can stay anonymous) As for your suggestion, I actually find it to be more detrimental because the more I read the wonderful fanfics that others wrote, the more awful my writing seems. This lowers my confidence and further encourages me to stop writing fanfic even though I love it.

**** I feel you on the shy thing. Even my reddit responses I write in a word doc before I post.

Anyhow, I don't think reading should discourage you. For me, the more I read the more I demand of my writing. It makes me slower, yes, but its only because I take a lot more things into consideration. Whereas before I was happily writing 10k words of trope trash where Lord Harry and Daphne go to Diagon Alley to buy expanded trunks. Now I spend much more time wondering whether my dialogue reflects the characters personality.

Though all in all, I think your writing must match the pace of your ideas or else you'll get discouraged. So, what I've been trying now is to write up a rough sketch of the scene before I go and actually write it.

For example:

Harry is depressed cause he can't go to Hogsmeade. Daphne can't go either (her parents won't let her). Somehow, they bump into each other and decide to hang out for the day. They eat lunch at the great hall start finding out they have a lot in common. Once the jokes die down. They settle on going to the library. As they are making their way giggling and such they bump into Snape and Daphne says some witty insult to Snape(Harry is in awe). They make it to the library and discuss Sirius.

Its not even close to complete. But it gives me the pleasure of having something down and having somewhere to go even if I can't finish the scene.

***** I like the way you planned out the scene so that it gives you a good sense of what the chapter is trying to capture. Btw I'm a big Haphne fan too. Lol the fanfic I wrote about develops their relationship rather slowly. I can see where you are going with reading other works but for me I kinda felt jealous~ I know that sounds a bit silly but their writing is like god level compared to mine. The more I read, the less I felt confident about my writing. That's why I started to read less fanfiction so I can focus on getting my creativity back :)

****** That makes sense. Some people are just gods at writing. I actually suck at writing as well. I choose my major (Engineering) based on the fact that I never wanted to do an English class again.

Anyways, I hope everything works out for you!

** It's a stressful time. If something you do as a hobby is only adding to your stress, take a break from it. And just /not writing/ doesn't qualify ã…¡ Stop thinking about it. Don't re-read what you've got so far. Focus on school and any other activities you may have.

Thing is, you should return to writing only once writing itself is fun again. As soon as feedback trumps the creative process, a pressure you don't need appears. While you're in the writing groove that pressure may feel like a welcome push and make the whole process feel more rewarding, but if you fall out of the loop...you get what you're going through right now.

(Feedback feels good. But better think of it as a perk rather than the purpose.)

For now it's important to remember that your life is priority and deserves all due attention in order to be dealt with. The story will be there once you're ready to return to it. Its readers will be there too, be it those who had patiently awaited an update or new ones coming along for the ride.

If you haven't already, it may help you feel more at peace if you announce/declare the hiatus so that anyone who may be waiting for updates knows you are focusing on private affairs for the time being (and have intentions of coming back). Wish you the best of luck, and I'm certain you'll claw out of this rough patch sooner or later ðŸ’ª

*** Thank you for your feedback! I find your response to be very enlightening. I try to forget about writing fanfiction many times, but against my better judgement, it keeps reappearing and really taking a hit on my guilt. Even if I do manage to update sometime in the future, I'm afraid I won't feel the same kind of joy writing fanfiction. It's that sort of feeling when you haven't done something in a long time and then you slowly lose interest in it.

Yes I have declared hiatus, but many readers don't actually read author notes or profiles so I feel like it wouldn't matter either way. But thanks for the suggestion anyways! I'll try my best!

** Hey, I can relate. I haven't updated since 2018 - life just got hectic, but also it's like there's this mental block where I'm so intent on making the next chapters perfect that I can't just call them finished. I also look back at the story and can see a lot of things that could be better. At first I thought I would rewrite the first few chapters so they would better match my current writing style, but eventually I decided just to leave them. I think it's cool that the improvement in writing can be seen as the story goes on, because back when I was posting the early chapters I really did think they were my best.

Most readers understand that life happens and updates aren't always regular. I have taken big breaks over the course of posting my fic and people are always appreciative when I update after a long time. It is definitely easy to lean on reviews for both encouragement and criticism, but what is important is that you are having fun with it. Take your time getting back into it and hopefully we will both be posting again soon! ðŸ˜Š

*** Hey there fellow author! Thanks for your feedback! I completely feel the same way. I look back on my earlier chapters and they look absolutely HORRENDOUS. But like a few of my readers have said, my writing and grammar has really improved over the course of the fanfic. I do hope that when I post again, people are just as appreciative as your readers. I feel a indescribable feeling of impending hate coming at me but that's probably because I haven't really experienced taking breaks from fanfic before. Cheers! Hopefully we can both post again soon!

** I just tore down one of my story from AO3, because I am in the middle of the rewrite. Is that the answer for you?

** I used to update every day, then every week, but have a deteriorative condition that has been terrible and last year I actually got a comment on one of my fics saying â€˜I love this! I hope you update this year!' And of course cried my eyes out. It broke my heart but we just have to do what we can.

And honestly? You were trying to do remote learning during a global pandemic. Pretty much all of the fan fic authors I know including myself couldn't write and we weren't still trying to deal with school. Please go easy on yourself.

You do lose some readers when you're not updating regularly. Some people are actually really entitled and expect fan fic writers who do all of this work and create content for free to cater to their need for fresh stuff every week and if you're not updating for whatever reason they'll ditch you

but

There are readers who when you come back and update will send you excited comments and will be thrilled that you were able to get a chapter out. It's so nice

I've linked this before but I found this thread last year, when the quarantine was just over for me (in Western Australia), so maybe three or four months into the crisis, and it was really encouraging and reminded me that we actually can't alway last create in a crisis and we shouldn't expect ourselves to. A lot of these people are really established fan fic veterans, so you're in good company.

I encourage you to look over [[https://howdidthisevenhappenanyway.tumblr.com/post/624866776684134400/can-you-indulge-me-please-given-the-recent][this post]] , read the notes, and see that writing is hard. It just is. And last year? Was fucked up.

In regards to continuing on? Just post a new chapter. I promise four months is not very long for a break at all. If you explain what's going on, or even if you don't, people won't hate you. They'll be happy there's more content!

*** I don't know if that was very practical advice so I'll give you something I do that helps with both my art practice and my writing.

When I'm feeling demotivated I don't think of how it affects others, I go back and look at my work and I remember why it is I wanted to make it. What is it about my work that makes me go you know what? With all the work out there in the world, why did I think I wanted to make more? And I remember that I make work that says things that I've never found in others' work.

Maybe there's a headcanon you have or a way you write a character that others haven't done, or maybe you're writing a painting that just...needs more content. There's a reason you wanted to make some stories, so go back and remember that feeling, and hopefully you'll find some motivation, and just so we're clear, sometimes we need to start a new story first, and then eventually we get back to the other one (or we don't, and that's ok too, because we're not machines, and sometimes we just...can't finish sometimes)

*** thank you so much for your feedback! It really let me so things differently. I've read the post you linked over and I can see that due to the pandemic, many authors not only myself have been struggling just as much if not more. wow people actually leave bc of that? I never realized how selfish readers are. I sincerely do hope I don't lose a lot of my readers because they were the supporters and motivation that keep me writing my longfic. That's basically why I could have achieved such a successful (In my eyes) fanfiction. If four months isn't that long, then what is?

**** I don't know, so I just looked and...two years? I've updated other fics after that but this one I just haven't been happy with anything I've written for it in a long time, and can't seem to figure out how to finish it

But there have been fics that updated after ten years, so really four months is nothing!

I'm so glad the post helped! I know it really helped me when I saw it
