:END:
I'm reasonably certain that it was on FFN. The divergence from canon was /I think/ that Percy attempted to run away from home when he was younger and nobody cared? When he's in Hogwarts and sorted into Slytherin he's friends with Adrian Pucey (or maybe just another random Slytherin). Then the fic skips like 4 years and Percy and Adrian (or whoever) are no longer best friends but bitter enemies. Hope this rings a bell for someone


** They did care--but he ran away becuase he thought they didn't care, Its '[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11729812/1/Ares][Aries]]'
