The idea for this story came to me after I read story after story with Harry and everyone else acting like mini adults. In a way, they are mini adults. But I wanted to explore Harry's interpersonal relationships in a we that I felt was more teenage-y. It's a romance but there's much more to it than that. I also am exploring Harry's relationships with the rest of the school., specially the Gryffindor boys in his year. I hope you guys give it a read and tell me what you think of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10951430/1/Surroundings][Surroundings]] .


** I've been following it quite a time, and I really enjoy the work done. It happens in any fantasy novel, or story, that we tend to forget that the characters al also human people, and they should have to deal with their every day life, plus the amount of problems the bad guys cause. I thnik this fic reflect exactly that.

I really enjoy it. Keep on working!! :D

** Just finished chapter 11. Great work! I think you capture teenagers and teenage love really well. I especially like the DnD with the Gryffindor boys. There were a few spelling mistakes. "purpose" as porpoise made me laugh out loud. I'm looking forward to your updates!

** I just read the story until last chapter. And will tell you plot regarding Ginny is being completely silly. As far as I understand, it's pretty much canon universe. And in canon, Ginny never really did anything to make Harry to date her. It was rather way around. Ginny outgrew Harry's crash and dated couple of boys but suddenly Harry had 'chest monsters' and other feelings and he interrupted Dean and Ginny's personal moment which ultimately lead to breakup.

Good thing that you didn't bash Ron. That's why I will continue to follow how the story progresses. And I will hope you will reconsider plot regarding Ginny's.

Someday I hope someone will write a Good H/D story without making silly environment around Ginny. It's so predictable and so annoying when someone write a Ginny character trying to interlude Harry's relationships.

*** Hey there, thanks for the input! Ginny is trying to interlude on Harry's relationship with Daphne only as much as she is trying to set him up with Hermione. In the way that teenage boys/girls try to set their friends up because they think their significant others are not a good match? I do agree I might not have properly expressed it in the story but, trust me, this is not some sick plot to try and make Ginny an antagonist. I see it as a friend trying to make her best friend get the boy she likes.

Either way, I am glad you are enjoying the story because of Ron! He and the rest of the Gryffindor boys are one of my favorite things to write about in this story.

** Just read the whole story in one go, made it a favorite (supper rare) and am now following.

First off, your writing style is wonderful. The concepts and the sceens are vivid in my mind and not weighed down by needless exposition.

You're promoting this as a Harry/Daphne story, but your plot seems more powerful than their pairing. I'm really looking forward to seeing where this goes!

Lastly, I feel your characterization of Ron fits my mental picture perfectly, thanks for not bashing.
