Looking for a fic with Harry and Hermione travel between different timelines with soulbound versions of them that failed. Involves Nicholas flamel.

Been trying to remember the name but I can't remember where I saw it.

Also looking for a Harmony fic where Harry's headmaster with back problems. And its the 2nd annual triwizard. And hes got a fav student in slytherin.


** The second one Is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9615772/1/][Skeletons]] i'm pretty sure, no idea on the first.

#+begin_quote
  We all have skeletons, when the Triwizard Tournament is hosted at Hogwarts to 'boost moral' and 'remember Cedric Diggory' all of Harry's secrets start to come out as he struggles with running the school and the tournament, working with his ex, facing a life changing injury and falling for his best friend! AU AFTER DH. Harmony. M for language and sexual themes!
