Hey ya'll. I have seen a few stories that play into the dark side is good trope, or severitus trope, or both of those tropes in the same fic and in these fics Narcissa and Lucius are expanded upon to an extent and treat harry respectfully and kindly. Or there have been other fics where they learn about Harry's lack of knowledge of pureblood culture and strive to teach him it because they now know he was not being arrogant and rude, he truly did not know, or have the means to learn.

My question is do you guys have any fics where Narcissa and Lucius and I guess in turn also Draco, treat harry differently then in canon? Also, do you know any fics that expand on Narcissa's and Lucius's character and their interaction with each other, or with other characters in the universe?

I just like how some authors expand on who the Malfoy's are behind closed doors and its interesting to see other author's take on the canon characters and how they change the characters personality to become au, or to explain why they acted the way they did in canon, more then just what is shown on the surface, if that makes sense. I really like fics where author's have a caring Narcissa and protective Lucius in private, and their coldness is only a pureblood mask in public.

Any recommendations are appreciated and hope ya'll are staying safe with covid and everything else that is going on in the world right now. Happy reading :)


** I have a few! Although none of them deal with Lucius and Narcissa interacting with Harry (in a canon-compliant or AU sense), they're all about their relationship with one another.

Under Obligation would be a good one to start with, it's one of the oldest and most popular Lucissa stories. It was written before HBP and the Black Family tree came out so some of the details are no longer canon (age order of the Black sisters, extended family names, etc) but I still think it holds up well. A lot of Lucissa seems inspired by this story in some way or another. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2078117/1/Under-Obligation]]

If you enjoy that but would like something lighter or, conversely, more serious, the authors who collaborated on Under Obligation each wrote their own really excellent stories. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1329152/1/Tainted-Love][Tainted Love]] is darker and more complex but incomplete, and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2025248/1/Lessons][Lessons]] is fluffier and finished.

A more recent, canon-compliant story is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26862214][Vacillation]]. A lot of Bellatrix and Rodolphus in the story as well. It's very long and in-depth about their feelings towards each other growing over the years, bit of a commitment.

If you're looking for something brief but beautiful, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2999761/1/Goodnight-Little-Dragon][Goodnight Little Dragon]] is probably my favorite one-shot of the family. So sweet and touching.

Again on the flip side if you'd like a truly, deeply disturbing one-shot... got that for ya too in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5933746/1/Paterfamilias][Paterfamilias]]. It's only rated T but it will mess you up and you'll need to read through it twice to bring all the pieces together... be warned!

** 'Harry's cousins' has a very lovely depiction of the Malfoys taking Harry in when they find out how unhappy he is at the Dursleys'. The way Lucius forms a relationship with Harry is especially well described. Sadly abandoned now, but well worth reading anyway.

  The Dursleys have never wanted Harry, so when he fortuitously stumbles across a book on Wizard Family Trees, he writes a letter, hoping to find another family to take him in, hopefully one that won't mind when he does 'freaky' stuff....
