  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

** Well some obvious examples would be:

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived): has a death-eater child who is something of a prodigy like Harry as well.

linkffn(The Denarian Renegade): this one takes a while, and Harry can be a real annoyance, but by the third book you see that she is more complex than most OC characters (killer at 15, etc. etc.).

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  Scorpius Malfoy and Albus Potter have decided fifth year is going to be their year; the year everything falls into place for them both and the year they show the bullies they aren't afraid of them. Scorpius receives a prefect badge and Albus is going to join the Quidditch team, if Scorpius can just convince him that he should try out. It's going to be the year everything works out for them, and if that means Scorpius keeping his huge crush on his best friend a secret, then that's just what he's going to have to do.It's just a crush. He can get over it well before fifth year is over, can't he?
