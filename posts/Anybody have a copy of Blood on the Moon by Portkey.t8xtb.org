I'm talking about the /amazing/ R/T fic that was up on Checkmated for awhile, but then the author took it down. I believe she took it down all of her fics, as well.

If anybody has a copy of it, or knows where one exists... you would be my favorite person right about now.


** Portkey has a [[http://portkey-fics.livejournal.com/][livejournal page]]. For those of you on lj, leave her a comment and she will friend you so you can view her fics.

** I realize I'm late coming to this, but I too am looking for a copy of Blood on the Moon. If you happen to find it, let me know? Thanks.
