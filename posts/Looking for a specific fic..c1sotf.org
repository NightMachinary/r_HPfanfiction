:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It had Dumbledore passing away and giving Harry a position. I remember some council and Harry and people from other countries fighting dragons in... Canada? It was on fanfiction.net


** Is it this? linkffn(12848494) I remember reading this back when it had like 26 chapters, and I think this is what you're talking about

#+begin_quote
  People rally to a just man, as Umbridge finds when the DA follows Harry to arrest her and demand that the Wizengamot try her for torture. When Dumbledore seeks atonement in battle against Voldemort Harry inherits his power and his responsibilities. Harry must learn to wield those powers in a world where law and justice have powerful enemies and many must atone for injustice done.

** Could it be linkffn(Harry Potter and the Apathy of Freedom by nonjon)? There wasn't any dragon fighting that I can recall, but there was a council and Harry became the Headmaster of Hogwarts.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. After ten years in Azkaban Harry emerges a changed man. Enlightened and respectful, he is creature of magic full of disappointment and shame in his own race. And yet wielding power that none can match.
