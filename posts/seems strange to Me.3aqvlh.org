well, to be honest i intrigued with Harry potter character. He seems to me like plain normal guy with ordinary skill, isn't that strange? He who they say have a great powerboost magic is so ordinary and have no skill whatover, and then every turn his adventure, he just got out from there with luck, wew. Lucky Bastard he is really..

im not expert about child abuse psychology, but from i know and observe, a child who raised in abuse, dark surrounding, neglect from family, discrimmination from people is always want to blend to people. wanna look ordinary and oversight or even become attention seeker and be strong. But they are NOT FINE. so it strange to me when harry is clearly abused all his life until his 11 year old, get a surprise become wizard and come to new surrounding, but dont look overwhelm. and JK. Rowling make him really look like Goody Buddie Two Shoes. and then with every adventure all his life, he seem content just become plain ordinary people again and happily ever after.

Uhh.. it so unlikely to me


** I actually work in child psychology, and what you say is true...but you'd be surprised at the number who do well despite having a truly shitty background (and I'm talking even worse than the neglect Harry received). I'm continually amazed by the some of the children I meet in my job...despite having the odds stacked against them, they cope pretty well (even /thrive/ sometimes). Humans are great at surviving. They find protective factors in unlikely places. It's something we don't really understand very well in psychology. Some people have great resiliency in the face of adversity and still others break under much less. Doesn't mean one person's experience is negated by the horrors of another. It just means that no two people are alike.

I used to think that Harry's background wasn't believable...but then I actually met THOSE children. People in psychology more or less agree that everyone is born with a range of potential. If they grow up in a supportive environment, they fall within the upper end of the spectrum (think James - Animagus at 15). Harry probably fell within the lower end of his capabilities...which was still pretty high because his parents were both extremely talented. Nature vs Nurture in harmony.

Also, this is children's book. It's the classic story of the orphan against the "bad guys" (think Star Wars, Wizard of Oz, Narnia, etc), so the good guy always prevails.

** Setting aside that this started as a fantasy fable in the vein of James and the Giant Peach, I always assumed that Harry wasn't as emotionally affected by the Dursley's abuses because a part of his mother was always with him, protecting him and assuring him that they were wrong and that Harry was a perfectly good boy.

Of course, he could never tell anyone about that because he never heard words in his head. Nonetheless, Lily protected him from monsters great and small.

** In a world where a percentage of the population is magical, he was ordinary. Then of course there's the fact that the series started with them as fairly young children. It wouldn't make sense for him to start out all powerful. His family was neglectful, and yes--that is abuse. But, I think maybe you've read too many fanon portrayals of the Dursleys. In my opinion, Harry choosing to become an Auror was really a continuation of how he'd always been. And plain ordinary people, have families to love, that love them back.
