:END:
all I remember about this fic, is that harry somehow conquered fiendfyre, after Bellatrix broke into the school and summoned it. she Was disguised as pomphrey if I remember correctly, and was discovered right after Barty crouch junior was. sorry if it isn't much to go on but it's all I remember

** The fic is “I'm Still Here”

I'd also recommend the two stories written by other authors based on that one

“From Ruin” and “I'm Back”
