Clearly, when a teenager, he believed in pure-blood supremacy to some extent, and was heading down a dangerous path to seize power. How much of him changed at the end of DH, at the age of 38?

  “You disgust me,” said Dumbledore, and Harry had never heard so much contempt in his voice. Snape seemed to shrink a little.

  “You do not care, then, about the deaths of her husband and child? They can die, as long as you have what you want?”

  Dumbledore opened his eyes. Snape looked horrified.

  “You have kept him alive so that he can die at the right moment?”

  “Don't be shocked, Severus. How many men and women have you watched die?”

  “Lately, only those whom I could not save,” said Snape.

the flip is clear- /snape/ is horrified at /albus'/ disregard for human life

he actively opposes pureblood supremacy and risks his life to help and saves others

** Not much, if at all.

He is still the same person he was when Lily died. He didn't turn to the light side because Voldemort was evil, he did it because he got his love(read: childhood obsession) killed. He really didn't turn even good, he just joined the good guys. He was still a bad guy just forced into doing the right things.

** I don't think it's clear at all that he "believed in pure-blood supremacy." He was an abused child who, like Harry, had his hopes of a new start at school dashed by the sheer blindness and/or complacency of the faculty toward bullying. He makes alliances where he can --- which, for a Slytherin, means only within his own house. Desperate to fit in with his new friends, he picks up their habits of speech and behavior. Clearly, he lashed out at Lily only through abject humiliation, the specific slur he used having nothing to do with their relationship, but what, in his anger to lash out at someone, anyone, he knew would hurt. (That he nearly immediately tried to apologize, more than once, and that she refused to even talk to him /for the rest of her life/ does not speak well of HER character.) Then the episode where he is set up to be mauled, possibly killed, and HE is the one who is punished and threatened.

All of which led to the spiteful, bitter, friendless man whose only goal in life is to *make sure he is never that powerless again*. Ripe pickings for a powerful, charismatic sociopath who, by the way, CAN READ HIS MIND to figure out exactly what to say to woo this vulnerable child-man over to his side. Do you really think that a pre-insane Voldemort immediately explained or showed his followers the depths of depravity he would lead them into? Dumbledore had already shown that he held no value for teenaged Severus, because he wasn't one of his precious Gryffindors. What side would you expect him to pick?

*** I do feel that his character is set out to be tragical. If I were in his shoes, entering a school full of hope yet instantly got bullied, outnumbered, and ended up losing the love of his life to one of the bullies...Hell I might break at one point. His action is definitely not all his fault, I can see to that. But as the book goes JKR was determined to make his life all bitter. No matter what portion of these unfortunate events are actually his doing. I'm just wondering how much he changed at the end.

** Pretty much everything about him changed the day he learned that the prophecy revolved around Lily and her (then unborn) son. He became a DA after graduating from Hogwarts in 1979, learned of the prophecy in the summer of 1980 and switch sides after his conversation with Dumbledore proclaiming he'd do 'anything' to pretect her. He was a DA for 1,5 years tops. He had switched sides even before Lily's death.

Aside from that, I'm pretty sure he got a lot more confident in his abilities since he didn't exactly show that he was able to fend for himself during his teenage years, but he definitely did as an adult.

we don't really know when he became a DE? it could have been in 7th year, it could have been a week before the prophecy

**** You're right about that. Malfoy did get the mark while still in school. Voldemort was still on the rise though, during the Marauders era. It's just guessing at this point, but it does make more sense if he wanted to mark Death Eaters until after they had graduated.

*** He did turn to the light when he heard the prophecy, and Marauders picking on him was a big factor why he hangs around people like Avery. But if the prophecy didn't involve Lily, would he have done the same? I do believe he changed quite a bit, but this was a question that I sometimes wonder about.

No. He had heard enough of the prophecy to know that he was putting the target on an infant. He did not care and still told it to Voldemort to gain his favor.

***** It's pretty sad to think about it. Giving information that would get a baby killed, just to move higher in the death eater hierarchy. He possibly did not care at that time. I am wondering though, during the 17 years after Lily died, did his view change somehow? That he no longer cares only about Lily, but also other people as well?

****** You're assuming he realized it would get a baby killed. Nothing about the prophecy says that the one who approaches is a baby. Most people don't hear "approaches" and think it means a baby is being born. It is, in fact, more likely a rational person (which Voldemort, arguably, is not) will think of somebody coming nearer, possibly coming to the UK from a different country. It could have been anybody, of any age, whose birthday was at the end of the seventh month (which also has multiple interpretations).

******* Well you do have a point...so perhaps not a baby, still definitely a person. It is still really bad, but not to the extent to get a baby killed.

****** To be honest no. He was still fundamentally the same person he was before. Just his goals changed.

At the time his goal was to move higher in the death eater hierarchy and he was willing to and did do everything to achieve this.

Then his goals changed to destroying Voldemort and he did everything he could to achieve it. He is still willing to do whatever it takes to achieve his goals.

**** I suppose no one will ever find out what he would have done had it not been about Lily, but I suppose the entire character of Snape wouldn't have been as significant then either. Lily and Severus probably weren't the only people that were friends that separated because of the choices they made.

***** Well...that's true, his devotion towards Lily is a huge part of who he is, he loved her until the very end. Though it feels like she‘s an exception to him, that he probably would not have cared if it was someone else. Still, that was Snape at 20 years of age, perhaps more about him changed during his road to redemption?

****** It is a good question whether any other things about him changed during his journey into adulthood.\\
I suppose, like it is with many adults, you just start to accept things more for the way they are. I think he may have appreciated the stability and safety that his job as a teacher provided, even if he hated the job itself. He got to live at Hogwarts, which, as Harry also compared to himself, was the only place he ever called home. I also believe that he may have a very hard time letting go of the past. That's not just evident with Lily's passing, but also because he returns to Cokeworth ever summer even though it is a place filled with horrible memories.

We shouldn't forget that in the end, Rowling did write the books with children as the general audience in mind. This fandom has a tendency to overanalyse things about the characters and plots as a whole because we're starving for new content in a way that an adult (which the whole first generation of readers now is) would want more explanation and expansion on the magical world she built (and I am no exception to that).

Snape is such a complex character that it's easy to keep digging into a bag of "what-ifs" in his case. In the longfic I've written about him I put a lot of emphasis on the PTSD side of his life. Whether he actually has it or not is a What-If, but from my personal stance I believe it to be true because of the scenes of him as a boy and because of what Rowling had written on the old Pottermore site about his father frequently having used a whip. The foundation of his childhood formed his way of reasoning later on in life.
