The only requirements for use of floof powder is an lit fireplace.

Wood or magical is conventional when using the floo, however other stuff can be used in a pinch.

However, after throwing ______ into the fireplace, and adding floo powder, ________ happens.

Ex: Jamie the wizard, who is currently getting her house raided by muggle policemen for possession of a frankly absurd amount of drugs, burns them before flooing out of the house, due to the weird quality of the flame, she becomes cursed to constantly catch the attention of both hippies and people selling homemade crafts on etsy.

Ex: A fire made of thermite is extremely... enthusiastic. Dangerously so. Only for daredevils with proper safety equipment or people who can't die/stay dead.


** I bet the hotbox experience you could get by throwing weed and floo powder into the fireplace and then sticking your head in would be great, that's my only contribution to this discussion

** ... This explains so much about the Lovegoods. Clearly they were caught up in a botched Floo experiment!
