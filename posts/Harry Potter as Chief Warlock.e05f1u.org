Any fanfics in which Harry becomes Chief Warlock since he is the best option. Kind how it happens in linkffn(Strange Reflections by LeQuin)

He does not want to mess around with politics but he is semi-forced into it. Or a Harry that hates politics but is bloody good at them and is convinced to be part of them since everyone fears him after the war.


** Harry rarely takes the position of Chief Warlock in fics. I know only two:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(10595005): As a result, he no longer takes part in frontline operations except some defensive actions early on.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7135971/1/The-Voyage-of-the-Starship-Hedwig][The Voyage of Starship Hedwig]], linkffn(7135971): He rules their fledgling colony with an iron fist, especially so after his faction squashes their enemies middle of the story.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

  Just before her death Sybill Trelawney makes one last prophecy: to prevent a magical genocide Harry Potter must leave the Earth, and find a new home for his people around a distant star.

** Linkffn(Strange Reflections by LeQuin)

This is a post-war canon divergence story. Harry is asked to swear in the new democratically elected Wizengamot and preside over its first session where they would be electing the new Chief Warlock. The session devolves into shouting and screaming and fisticuffs before Harry steps in and gets them to stop. Augusta Longbottom immediately nominates Harry as the new Chief Warlock and everyone else agrees, with Kingsley convincing Harry to take the job.
