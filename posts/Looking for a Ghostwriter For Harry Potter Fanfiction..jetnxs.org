I have a few ideas and things written down for a few different Harry Potter fics and I was just looking for someone who would like to write them. All I ask is that if you are interested, allow me to watch your progress and proofread to see what you have come up with and allow me to make some suggestions and allow me to add some comments. If you're interested please PM me so we can talk more and work something out. I would really appreciate the help if you are willing to write for me and I would give you full credit for anything you write and I'm not asking for anyone to take the time away from their own fics to write my own. I only ask that you be willing and free to do this. Please email me at missdowney94 if you are interested. If you are not interested I understand and you can act like you never even seen this post. If no one is interested in writing for me I could use a beta if that is better.


** I think you're unfamiliar with the usual meaning of the word "ghostwriter", which is someone who gets paid to write something that you are then credited for. Sometimes this is real subterfuge (hiring someone else to write your college termpapers) and sometimes it's relatively above board (politician memoir with politician as main author and "with so-and-so" in a subtitle). In the second case you know that so-and-so did all the writing, typically after having a few conversations with the politician about what to do in the book.

Are you seriously offering to pay someone? What is your budget? What are you hoping to get out of it? What you're describing (say what you want the story to be about, pay someone to write it, with them getting the credit) is usually called a "commission" rather than ghostwriting. That is perfectly legit, no different than commissioning an artist to paint a picture of your cat.

If you just have some ideas you'd like to see in a fic and you're not looking to pay for it, that's called a "prompt" and it's fine to post prompts on the subreddit. There is a special flair for them, lots of them are posted every day, and some of them result in good stories.

** $30/Page. Based on the idea an agreement will be made on expected page length before I type a single word. Half will be paid upfront. A timeline will be provided after payment.

This is less than my normal ghostwriting fees. By a fairly substantial margin.

** If the idea is something I'm passionate about, I'd be happy to collaborate.

** This sounds like the fanfiction version of a common problem for authors: the person who says, "I've got a great idea for a book! I'll give you the idea and you write it, then we'll split the money!"

Uh, no. Most authors have more ideas than they know what to do with. It's the writing itself that's the work and the art.

They will refuse to listen to your idea for legal reasons --- they don't want you to ever come back and try to sue them for royalties if they write something that has even a smidgen that's somewhat similar to a detail in your proposal.

~~~~~~~

In this case, it sounds like what you need is something a bit more involved than just a beta reader. You have a story idea that you want to nurture along, but are unsure of your writing abilities. You need a collaborator, or maybe a writer's circle who will critique your work without taking over the writing.

Note that I have absolutely no helpful advice to give on how to get either of these things.

Another option would be to turn your idea into a prompt or challenge, and see what multiple people make of your idea. You would have no creative control over the results, but it could be fun to see the many directions it could take. And you could write one, too and see how it compares.
