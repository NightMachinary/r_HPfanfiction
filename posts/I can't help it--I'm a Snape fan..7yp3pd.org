** I love Snape as a character. He is a decidedly /adult/ character in a children's series. Our surface reaction to his is "ew! evil!" and children love to hate the greasy-git. He is the bully teacher we have all dealt with over time.

But I think about him as an adult. He was abused and neglected as a child. Once sorted into Slytherin, some older purebloods took him under their wing - of course he would want to blossom under them. He let himself get swept up in the whirlwind of peer-pressure and abandoned the one person who genuinely liked him. After Hogwarts, he loses his best friend and vows revenge for her death -- meaning he goes against those "friends" who took him in all those years ago.

Then he gets forced to teach small children, whom he does not relate to very well, and after suffering through that for years, his love's child shows up. Except, this child is a spitting image of his childhood Gryffindor bully.

Snape is like one of those dirty jokes cartoons toss in to keep the parents entertained. He is a complex, grey, completely convoluted character. And I love him for it.

** I would've liked him better if he was more selfish - or maybe less self-destructive would be a better way to put it. He has nothing to live for but Lily's memory and it seems has given up on ever creating a new life for himself. That's actually the main reason I can't root for him, as weird as it sounds. If he actively worked to better himself as a person and to build himself a future (beyond the more immediate worry of Voldemort) that would've made him more relatable to me.

Eh, I think it usually has to be clarified. I mean, in the case of Hanibal it's pretty obvious that you aren't a pervert who's into canibalism... but there are plenty of people in the fandom who genuinely like Snape and think he's a great dude.

I've seen it in other fandoms too, when people get too involved in "cool" antagonists and start to make excuses for them. In particular when they appear as PoV characters.

The "Dark Harry" genre is full of this shit. Even the authors seem to occasionally forget that their protagonist is the bad guy.

Sure, I sympathize/empathize with the poor little boy a lot. Maybe that's just the misunderstanding between us? Is that what you are getting at? I don't sympathize with teenager Snape though, who decides that's a good reason to start killing muggleborns though. He's an asshole. And turns out, even though his asshole-ness leads to the death of his lustful obsession he decides to remain an asshole, tormenting little children (including the child of the woman he professes to have loved) in school to get his rocks off. I'm against the death penalty so I guess Azkaban would be an appropriate punishment and I wouldn't sympathize with him for rotting there.

There's plenty of people with terrible childhoods who don't turn out to become bastards (see Harry).

Yeah. It's horrible isn't it? Harry is an idiot. Who would name his poor child after a humungous cunt like Snape? Personally I find the attempts by JKR to turn a vile person like Snape into some kind of hero really disgusting, it's kinda terrible to be honest. Like applauding someone for cleaning up their own shit. "Hey idiot, how about not taking a dump in the hallway in the first place?"

Kinda. There's sympathetic tragic heroes or anti-heroes, but you usually aren't supposed to feel sympathetic towards the bad guys. That's why they are the villains. Except if you're a psychopath I guess: "Man, that Adolf Hitler guy had the right idea! What a tragic fate, poor man!".

I mean, that's why JKR is trying to paint Snape as some kind of hero, right? Because it would be weird to celebrate a villain? So he gets to nobly sacrifice his life as if that makes up for anything. People who have no strong moral principles are easily swayed by such appeals to authority though: "The author said X is a good guy so he most be good". That's why so many people feel the need to defend Snape even though he's objectively terrible and has no redeeming qualities. Oh, and Alan Rickman of course.

Before the prequels? Sure, I could have imagined some kind of tragic past... with a good and decent person underneath. After the prequels? Na, just kidding, turns out he's always been a dick. Looks like he's just a giant idiot and a whiny bitch, who likes to murder little children and has illusions of adequacy. The whole burning alive thing is kind off a shit fate, but maybe he should have considered not murdering innocent children.

But I agree that he is /supposed/ to be some kind of "tragic hero". The prequels just totally shit the bed in regards to him (just like JKR shit the bed with Snape), since he's either annoying (Episode 1 & 2) or revolting (Ep 3).

** u/FerusGrim:
#+begin_quote
  only choosing to side with Dumbledore because he hated Voldemort so for killing Lily.
#+end_quote

I wouldn't say this was the case. Voldemort threatening Lily was certainly what pushed the hay barrel over the hill, but I don't think, had Lily never been threatened, Snape would have stayed a Death Eater forever. Perhaps the only significant change would have been timing and whether or not he became a spy (He only became a spy at Dumbledore's request).

Note, before I continue, that I'm not defending any of Snape's actions. I'm also not saying he was a good person. Those are mostly opinions rooted in perspective. I'm going to lay out a few points that I think are important to distinguish in the often black-and-white portrayal of Snape's character.

Snape wasn't simply against Voldemort because he hated him.

Throughout the series, hidden underneath his sarcasm and biting cynicism and obvious disgust for some people we would otherwise consider extremely good characters, you can often see the /real and tangible/ connections he's made with people. In particular, the long-lasting staff at Hogwarts. These people were not simply colleagues - he lived with them for a more than decade-and-a-half before his death. They were his family. We're shown that he cares, at least, for McGonagall and shows reluctance and remorse for the death of Burbage.

Snape didn't believe in Voldemort's cause.

Often people focus so much on the fact that Snape called Lily a mudblood as untenable proof that Snape was a racist or a bad person. I think that's a naive way of viewing the situation. Does it make him a bad friend? Perhaps - I tend to think it does. I'm certainly not excusing it. Did Lily overreact? Should she have given him back his friendship? Perhaps not. But one ruined friendship that, in my opinion, rests solely on Snape's feet does not an entire character make.

Snape was not a character who was bullied in any real sense of the term. I actually /love/ that he believes he was bullied. J.K. Rowling takes great pains to show the depth of character, and later having it explained to Harry that Snape gave as good as he got. From Snape's perspective he was bullied, despite the fact that Snape himself often sought out confrontation with the Marauders. They were /school children/. They /all/ behaved reprehensibly.

In my personal opinion, Snape believed himself the victim because he convinced himself that he was. During the years before he lost Lily's friendship, teller her that he was the victim was how he rationalized his behavior to her. It made her stick around him. It kept her upset at Potter, someone Snape knew was a contender for her fancy. When Lily died, Snape kept the charade, perhaps attempting to continue hiding the contempt he felt for himself. His actions are what drove Lily away, in the end. He couldn't /really/ blame it on James Potter. For someone like Snape, that moment he drove Lily away was the moment he signed her death warrant. It's absolutely ridiculous to take that credit for himself, but J.K. Rowling loved to point out the similarities between Snape and Harry and Tom whenever possible. Harry, like Snape, had an overwhelming capacity to take responsibility for things that they couldn't have possibly had any control over. They internalized the guilt for the continuing war as personal failures.

Snape loved Lily. But it was more than that. He loved what she stood for.

Snape is often portrayed as a creepy, obsessed man clinging onto the memory of a dead woman. I think this is, again, an incredibly naive way of looking at the facts as they were presented.

Does a creepy, obsessed man continue on with his life, dedicating his entire purpose and soul to the /values/ of the person? No, he jacks off in the dark to photos of her red hair or some trite.

Snape dedicated his /life/ to ensuring that Voldemort fell. Additionally, he dedicated his /life/ to ensuring that /Harry Potter/ would live. He wanted her sacrifice to not be in vain.

The most accurate interpretation I can think of for the famous "Always" line uttered by Snape, and portrayed so brilliantly by Alan Rickman, R.I.P, is thus:

1. Snape gets upset when Dumbledore, essentially, says that they'd been raising Harry for slaughter. *
2. Dumbledore, shocked, asks if Snape had truly started to care for the boy.
3. Disgusted at the thought, Snape, perhaps to Dumbledore's disappointment, denies it.
4. Snape casts his patronus, taking on the form of what we may presume to be something that symbolizes Lily Evans.
5. "After all this time?"
6. "Always."

*I do not believe Dumbledore actually holds this opinion, it is merely what he needs to Snape to believe, so that Snape can report to Harry exactly what Dumbledore needs to convey to him.

Snape wasn't upset because he cared for Harry. Quite the opposite - he hates Harry. Undeservedly, and that's another side of the coin, but he does.

Snape was upset because allowing Harry to die, and worse, manipulating the situation to the point where Harry /was forced to die/, would invalidate what Snape believes to be Lily's strongest most important motivation in life - the survival of her son. Perhaps he even considers it her Last Request.

This isn't the type of man who's obsessed with the thought of just fucking this chick. It may have been unrequited, something I don't entirely believe, but he was /truly/ in love with this woman. One of the purest forms of love that I can possibly imagine. He didn't lust after her. He respected and admired her and, when she died, he carried on living to ensure that her ideals for a better world would be realized.

--------------

I'm going to conclude this, because this message has gotten to be entirely too long.

I don't think Snape was a perfect human. It's entirely open for debate on whether or not he was even a good person.

But what he was was a man with a mission. A pure mission. A respectable mission. And he was fucking overwhelmingly brave to pull it off as he did, even to his death.

I'll end this with an opinion that I share with Albus Dumbledore and, perhaps, it was one of the most important emphaseses and nuanced underlying points of the entire story put together by J.K. Rowling.

Sometimes Hogwarts just sorts the children way too fucking early.

** He is a brilliant character, and definitely one of the best written in the series, if not /the/ best one. To the point where fans on various platforms, forums and blogs were debating the seemingly eternal question "Is Snape Good or Bad?", up until the last day before the release of /Deathly Hallows/. Snape is definitely on the Light Side, though at the beginning it clearly is for selfish reasons, given that he only switched sides because Lily was in danger. But by /DH/, it does seem that he is genuinely converted, as evidenced when he reacts negatively to Phineas Nigellus using the "Mudblood" slur to describe Hermione.

But is he good in terms of being a good /person/? No, he is not, as clearly evidenced by his repeated bullying of (in particular) Harry, Neville and Hermione. This should be extremely clear. He is a truly grey character with many nasty characteristics. JKR said it best when she called him an "anti-hero".

** I mean, Snape is really funny.

Are his jokes incredibly dark? Yes. Are they very sarcastic? Oh, yes. Are they quite nasty? YES.

But the Snape we see has such a developed sense of humour that I genuinely think at a higher level - say, in the equivalent of a university - people would enjoy it rather than being scared of him. I'm not blaming the kids, particularly Neville, for being scared of him, because Snape's way too nasty for a kid to brush it off, but as a higher level teacher, I think Snape's whole shtick would keep you on your toes whilst performing at a higher level.

Besides, his nastiness aside, he really did get people to perform well in Potions. In HBP, all those students, bar Harry and Ron, got Os. Umbridge says he teaches them at a higher level than is mandated, et cetera.

Like! Arguably a bad man, and undoubtedly shouldn't be teaching actual children, but the idea that he's a bad teacher or that kids don't learn in his classroom always struck me as an idea manufacted BECAUSE someone doesn't like him as a person.

** Likeable characters are the bane of my existence. Not the idea that they exist, but the idea that all interesting characters /should/ be likeable, or else they're bad guys or shitty writing or something.

(For the purposes of this post, consider /unlikeable/ defined as a character you wouldn't want to be friends with, not a character that the audience is supposed to hate -- even if there can be some overlap, it's not the same thing.)

But really, there are some /fantastic/ examples of unlikeable but compelling characters out there: Amy Dunne, Patrick Bateman, Tony Soprano, Lou Bloom, Cersei Lannister, Rust Cohle.

With the exception of Cohle, the above examples are mostly villain protagonists, but Snape is one of the few "heroic" examples (for certain values of heroism). I can understand why he does what he does, even if I don't agree with it. His actions combined with his background make for a complex and deeply flawed character.

So yeah, I guess you could say that I like him, too.
