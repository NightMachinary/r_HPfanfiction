I don't get why so many fanfic authors look for ways to make the death as gory and as disgusting as possible. It's not even like they make a slow painful death but they just want to make it gory (see the fanon entrails expelling curse for example). If the standard wouldn't have been Voldemort, I would have understood, but since - unless he wants an information from you - he will try to make it quick and clean so no traces can lead to him, especially as there is a spell specifically designed for that, what's the point? Most of the gory deaths don't add any value to the fics (one exception might be "For lack of a bezoar") so are people doing it for shock value? Trying to recreate a shitty 2000s slasher movie?


** Fun ðŸ˜ˆ. Fun. It's fun to write. It's fun to just go hell for leather on a character. It's just fun to be as gruesome as possible.

I dunno, I write for me not for anyone else. And it's just fun sometimes, to be gruesome and vile and graphic and evil. It's very cathartic you know? To just let it all out.

** Well, the most obvious reason is because they can. And it also adds a certain level of realism into it.

Or they simply have an obsession or kink about such things. You never know.

*** They can... sure. Bellatrix could be spending precious seconds casting a curse that requires her to keep he wand pointed at Padma Patil in order to flay her and then Neville takes her from behind. Makes total sense from a practical stand point.

**** I mean, I have read fics in which the fact Bellatrix was so sadistic she'd lose sight of reality and practicality was basically the entirety of her characterization, so for Bellatrix it checks out.

** Voldemort doesn't care if the traces lead back to him(unless the situation demands subtly). He is well know as a powerful Dark Lord that likes to inspire fear into those against him.

Depends on the situation as well, but seeing your teammates head melt and organs fly out their body is going to lower your moral.

*** On the contrary I'd argue, Voldemort doesn't want traces to directly lead to him but to be linked to him by people's imagination. But most of his victims just end up disappearing that's a common theme in the second war, as well as the first war according to Sirius. You don't see gore or blood or entrails... just missing bodies and a floating skull with a snake popping out of its mouth above your house which I would think visually is quite enchanting.

**** Yes there was a lot of mystery, people went missing out of nowhere, didn't know who you cant trust etc.... its a â€˜kids' book so its not going to go into detail about people's organ getting dissolved and expelled fron their body.

Im sure realistically in a fight with no moral Dark Wizards its going to get gory if you get hit. Getting tortured? Probably gory, unless its just crucio. The wide use of AK insta death makes things a lot more clean.

If i'm reading a story and a Dark Wizard brutally murders of tortures someone I don't mind, its in character. If its oversatured or out of character, there are probably other flaws in the same story that would make me drop it as well.

***** The thing is that Voldemort wanted to keep his existence as a looming threat but not come right out in the open. In GoF... no one but his followers were supposed to know about his return, in OotP he mostly stays quiet and resorts to tactics such as sending the Devil's snare as a gift, in HBP his biggest attack is so secretive that the best the ministry can go by is "we believe giants might have been involved". When he takes over DH, he doesn't put himself in any position of power, but rather allows people to dwell in uncertainty and fear. The guy wants everything clean unless he needs information like in the case of Bertha Jorkins.

****** Yes he is an extemely manipulative and a work from the shadows Wizard, but you are talking about moments in time where he needs to be stealthy/in hiding. In an open fight, He w/ 10 DE's appareates in, the enemies apperates in, its going to get gory.

Gore is not a â€˜story dopping' thing for me if the author is of high quality. Personally in the stories I normally read it rarely seems over the top. These stories you are mentioning are of an average/low tier quality im guessing.

Personally, that's my problem with Gore in HP : the Unforgiveable Curses are the ultimate spells for a Dark Wizard, and they are "clean".

If a Dark Wizard want to kill someone, he has the killing Curse. And if he wants to torture someone, he has the Cruciatus, which is from the start superior to Muggle Torture since you don't have to worry about keeping your victim alive (well the Longbottoms showed that one could lose his mind with the pain, but a similar problem existed, or rather exist with "muggle" torture).

During a fight against a Dark Wizard, I think it's normal to have a bit of gore because they don't only use the Unforgiveables (Snape's Curse, the weird arrow of light the DE used in the DoM . . .), but I feel like some of the Curse we see in Canon are really over the top (flesh dissolving Curse, entrail exploding . . .). And it's not like these Curses are only used by one very sadic wizard, some story made they used by every possible bad guy.

****** Must be bad stories your reading then, from someone who prefers Dark stories I have never ran into this problem.

I don't see how Dark wizards using Dark spells that are only used to cause serious/fatal damage is a problem in a life/death fight. If they are not shown using other spells apart from the â€˜too gory' spells outside of a life/death fight then thats the authors fault for being too one dimensional.

** I needed to make Lucius' head explode in a bunch of green goo just before his eye was picked out. It helped me so Snape could deliver a oneliner afterwards.

** There's nothing wrong with a graphic gory death. It's how it's presented that is sometimes a problem. I've written it, about 100 words in a 2300 word story. No-one revels in it, but yes, I thought it had to be gory. It was an animal attack, and if you've ever watched animals taking down their next meal you'll know that they don't give a shit about whether they hurt their prey, and will eat it while it's still alive. I wrote the gore because I wanted to make the attack realistic.

If it's a human dealing out a gory death then you've got to have a good reason for the person to want to do that - revenge is a good one, as is being a nutter psycho - and for them to not worry about taking the time for it, and covering themselves and the surroundings in evidence.

A good reason for using something unsurvivable like an entrails-expelling curse would be that the target /must/ defend against it, they can't just take a minor hit while staying on the offensive like they might be able to with something that just makes a superficial cut.

** It is a cheap way of creating 'kick the dog' moments for the Death Eaters, especially if you are going for a 'Grey Harry' story (or for Harry in 'Dark Harry'). If both sides are trying to kill each other then you need to show that one side is clearly still evil, so you need to make their method of killing 'worse'.

In canon JKR seems to have this weird moral about 'killing under any circumstances is the absolute worst, but everything else is ok'. This is often dropped in fanfics because it really doesn't work that well when the stakes are that high. When you do that you end up with the Killing Curse being quite a kind spell, as at least it is a clean and painless death, so Death Eaters need to use something else, and sometimes writers take this thought and get carried away.

Also, if you are trying to portray the 'inner circle' Death Eaters, especially the likes of Bellatrix, as actual psychotic serial killers, then flamboyant, excessively painful methods of killing can be plausable. While it might be all urban legend, 'everyone knows' that insane killers like thier excessive ritualise murder routines. It might be inefficient, but that doesn't mean it isn't in character.

Finally there is probably an argument that there are certain parts of the fanfic community who probably shouldn't be allowed out in society around other people, and their fics should just be avoided.

Even some of the most notorious serial killers such as Ted Bundy still bashed their victims in the head or strangled them before proceeding to do the gory deeds.

** Ths is something that used to bother me.. the best explanation I got was that an emotional death was worth 30 regular ones , and a gory death was worth 2 emotional ones. So one horrific emotional Weasley death let's you get away with sparing the rest of the family for example.
