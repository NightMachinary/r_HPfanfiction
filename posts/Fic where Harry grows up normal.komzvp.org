A fic where Harry's parents aren't killed, but he's still the BWL and needs to kill Voldemort. I'm not looking for a WBWL, I've read those. But a Harry fic where he'd grow up as a spoiled Wizangamot heir destined for the potter heirship and title. I'd like to see how that Harry would react to the years events. Would he have the same friends? Etc. He'd most likely still be in Gryffindor. Bonus points if the story's Neville has his parents as well.


** I'll try a short opening piece for you.

"Mum!" Harry yelled from his bedroom as he pulled on an oversized Quidditch uniform shirt. His hair poked out from it's top like a bunch of black flowers sprouting from the ground. his green eyes poked from the contrasting red and gold uniform shirt he had finally slipped on. "Mum!" Harry repeated, "Yes, dear?" Lily shouted from downstairs, "What do you need, sweetie?" Harry leapt from his room and into the upstairs hallway, narrowly avoiding his father whom was carrying a couple broomsticks from his room. "Calm down, son!" James laughed, "Don't be too eager, we haven't even reserved seats for the game yet." he warned. Harry bolted downstairs faster than you could say "Nimbus 2000". Lily had prepared a few plates of food. Two white plates decorated with petunias and lily flower paintings, and one with a cartoon frog plastered to its center. the final plate had a large portion of porridge leaking over its edges. "Eat slowly, Harry," Lily ordered, "Don't choke this time, I mean it!" Just as Harry had scooped a heaping spoonful of porridge into his mouth, the doorbell rang. James smiled and leapt to his feet. "Sirius is here!" James opened the door to a very delighted Sirius who was holding a large gift bag in his hands. "What?" James exclaimed, "We said no gifts for Harry!" Sirius snickered, "It's not everyday your godson turns eleven, now is it?" The gift bag was moving. "What is it?" James sighed, "An owl." Sirius bragged.

** What if Harry's parents are alive and there is no Boy Who Lived at all, because Riddle went into politics instead of terrorism? So Harry is facing legalised discrimination and segregation instead of Death Eaters. On the other hand, Riddle may resort to rather /extreme/ measures to get the public support needed to push his agenda.
