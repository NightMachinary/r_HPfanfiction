In my Bloomsbury copy of Philosopher's Stone, Dumbledore offers McGonagall a /sherbet lemon/, not a lemon drop. Is it different in the Scholastic copy or is it just fanon?

Edit: Rather than replying to everyone, I'll just thank you all here. Thanks! I have an answer now!


** Sherbet lemon is the British English - in American copies it was changed to lemon drops.

** Lemon drops is what sherbert lemons are called in the US (I think). Also the whole thing where fanfics have Dumbledore obsessed with sherbert lemons/lemon drops and constantly offering people them bugs me. It was one time! They're mentioned only in that one scene as far as I can remember.

*** Nah, the irrational thing is that no one ever takes them. Lemon drops are fucking good and I love dumbledore for offering them. I'd be like, Dumbledore wants to see me? Yayyyy lemon drops!

***** Im totally fine with the idea of them being a receptacle for calming potions or pepper-ups or whatever.

Either one would have a good place in a headmaster's position. Hell we have pot candy and caffeinated candy in the real world.

The only issue I have is when they make it some sort of a sinister thing, just have him be upfront with it and it's a fine little tidbit in a story. It can even bring up awareness of laced foods for later plot points without it being ridiculous.

*** I think I'm happy with keeping it like that. It's hilarious if done right.

**** Another one I enjoy seeing done repeatedly is calling a goblin griphook when it isn't griphook and it being taken to comedic extremes.
