I'm not exactly ashamed of the quality of my stories; I already know that they're probably mediocre and hopelessly derivative. What I'm ashamed of is the /content/: I'm hyper-aware that what I'm writing has a bit of wish fulfillment on some level, and I don't want to burden anyone else with the contents of my mind.

Am I too self-conscious?


** Ask. If you are trying to make a grammatically well done fic, you are already doing better than a quarter of other writers. It really depends on what you want your beta to do.

Also a point to look at is this: if you are worried about letting /one/ person look at your fic who is meant to help you improve, what are you going to do when /multiple/ others read it and have an open line to comment? You write theses because you like them. They are your masterpieces. Own them and love them, because in fanfic writing, you are the only one who really has to ðŸ˜Š

When you put it that way, it seems so... simple!

I guess I'm too used to the low standards of fanfiction.net, because I'm not doing my best to make what I write good. :P

**** You'll do great. The wonderful thing about the internet is that there are tons of people with your same interests. Some will love it at least! What are you looking for in a beta?

** I love to read about things others disregard as wish fulfilment. Don't worry about other people you're creating your own world just let your beta know what kind of story it's going to be to see if they read and enjoy the genre.

** I can almost guarantee that anything you've come up with has been written before, and I'm not saying that to be mean but to reassure you that others share your interests and that it's highly unlikely you'll shock everyone. No need to be self conscious :).

As for finding a beta I know fanfiction.net has messgae boards for it but I don't have a link. You can probably find them by googling combinations of 'betas' 'fanfiction' 'Harry potter' etc. Livejournal also still has active communities both for writing in general and more specific pairings. Not knowing what your pairing is I can't really link you but, again, Google will usually turn up some results.

There are 700k HP stories on FFN alone. It will be very difficult to come up with a completely original idea. Don't let that dissuade you.

** Try this: Post a few chapters and in your AN say you're looking for a beta. Put a note on your Author's page as well.

Don't be self-conscious about fanfiction. It's really not worth it. All writers are inherently writing for themselves anyway. Instead, enjoy the anonymity fanfiction affords and post the shit out of whatever you want, wish fulfillment or otherwise.

** My advice is to suck it up and use the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/betareaders/book/Harry-Potter/?&languageid=1&rating=4&ppage=202][Beta page]] on ff.net to find someone to help make you a better writer. I've recently found two who are extremely good. Just send a polite PM with the details of your story and ask them if they'd be interested. I promise you'll gain some insight from a fresh pair of eyes on your work.

The link I've given is for all Harry Potter betas who have recently updated their profiles, hence they're more likely to still have active accounts.

You'll probably have to send multiple copies to people you think might help, so get a 'form letter' ready.

Mine looks like this:

#+begin_quote
  Dear XXXXXX,

  My name is XXXXXXX and I'm looking for a Beta reader for a story I'm writing in the Harry Potter universe. Here are the relevant details:

  Tentative Title: XXXXXX

  Genre: XXXXXX

  Rating: XXXXX

  Pairing: XXXXXX

  Summary: XXXXXXX

  If this sounds like something you'd be interested in beta'ing, please reply in a PM and I'll send you the Prologue. If not, no hard feelings.
#+end_quote

Hope this helps.

** I'm afraid so. I can guarantee that you're not going to be judged for writing what you want. I like to read harem fics; you don't get much more wish fulfillment than that.

Get a beta and let them have a look. If for some odd reason you do get a beta who judges (unfairly) what you wrote, drop them immediately and find another. You don't have to put up with that crap, nor do you deserve to.

If it's not graphic slash, I'd be happy to give what you wrote a once over, whatever it is. I'm a bit of a grammar nazi, so you can be sure your writing would be put through the grammatical wringer!

** I guarantee my mind thinks up more fucked things in an hour than yours does in a year.

If you just want someone to go over your writing for grammar and punctuation I would be happy to take a look. I would be the last person to judge for wish fulfillment, reading fanfic for a few years makes you numb to that.
