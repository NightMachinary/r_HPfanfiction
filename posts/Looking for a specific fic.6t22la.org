Started reading a few ages ago where Harry met up with a Death Eater(?) in a cafe, in was after OoP. Can't for the life of me find it again

Also, looking for some "good" Lord Potter/Black/manipulative Dumbledore/bashing etc fics that aren't usually suggested. Basically trope stories that everyone loves to hate.. only criteria is no graphic slash and over 50k wording.

Edit; he got a letter to meet someone in the cafe cause he had info regarding Voldemort, he then realized he was a death eater or a grey person... Can't remember much about it. For some reason I stopped reading it after a chapter. But I do remember it was over 100k wording as I rarely read stories with less wording

Edit 2; found it! It was linkffn(3902850)


** That's pretty vague. Met the death eater... by accident, and captured them? Dueled them? Saw them run away? Or, met them on purpose, because they wanted to apologize/ask for help/jump his bones?
