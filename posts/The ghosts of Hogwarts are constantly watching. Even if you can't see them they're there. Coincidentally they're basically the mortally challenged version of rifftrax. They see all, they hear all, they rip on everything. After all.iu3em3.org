#+TITLE: The ghosts of Hogwarts are constantly watching. Even if you can't see them they're there. Coincidentally they're basically the mortally challenged version of rifftrax. They see all, they hear all, they rip on everything. After all, what better way to spend the afterlife then making fun of the living

** "Bloody hell! One cannot wank in peace anymore?!" Whined Ron as he threw a sock at Sir Nicholas

*** "Pass me a toast, won't you?" asked Harry.

Ron fumed without raising his eyes from the table, "You can grab it yourself, it's not that far off"

Hermione raised her eyes in surprise, "What's the matter now? Quidditch practices?" she asked.

"No, nothing important." Ron hurried with his ears all red as he turned to his plate again.

"Quidditch had been going rather well. Ron has improved. He's just being a prat." said Harry.

"A prat?! You're the one asking for toast when it's half a foot away from you!"

Harry frowned at Ron's new outburst, then he turned to Hermione, "You know what? I think I remember what has Ron's knickers on a twist this morning." he started as Ron looked terrified.

"And what's that?" Hermione asked in curiosity.

"Nothing major. He was just wanking like a madman to one of your pictures when sir Nick came by. It kind of killed his mood."

Ron's face paled as his ears went deep red. His mouth was hanging open. Hermione turned to him, her eyes wide open and her cheeks quite red as well. Harry was grinning stupidly at his friends.

"Well, that's, ahm..." Hermione mumbled, turning away from Ron, "Quite an interruption."

"You can bet. Not sure if Moaning Myrtle would have cooled him down quicker though." Harry said as a large orange thrown by Ron came his way and Harry was barely able to dodge it.

"Oi"

Ron made an excuse to leave the table with a murderous look at Harry and just as he left, Harry talked to Hermione, "Bet, he's going to finish his pending 'business' at the dorms," Harry said casually.

Hermione, who had hurried to drink from her pumpkin juice, almost spilled it out at that. But before Harry could have a chance to laugh, a new orange came his way, this time hitting him right on the head.
