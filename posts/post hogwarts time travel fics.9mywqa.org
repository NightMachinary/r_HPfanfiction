Any fanfictions where 1. Harry is out of Hogwarts (graduate, post-war, anything) and had experienced some reality. 2. Is sent back in time without his body de-aging, so if he was 30 in his original time, he is 30 in his new time.

It doesn't have to be time travel only, adding a bit of au will be fine as well. But i do prefer storries that are not harem or slash.

Any recommendations?


** Don't know if this is your cup of tea but it's similar. Harry's only 19 or 20 though. Gets sent back in time to the marauder's days. Real good story

**** I couldn't get past the second chapter - both characters were too far from their canon personality and not compelling enough to get me interested.

***** The first couple are rough it's chapter 4 where the writing takes a big step up. It's a fun read nothing fantastic but a good way to waste time.

  Harry was massively disappointed in how things were going after the final battle. Nothing had changed, it only looked like it on the outside. So he decides to change the past to prevent certain things from happening. Being the Master of Death has its perks. Time-travel, Harry / OC

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1976, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter, 1976

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!
