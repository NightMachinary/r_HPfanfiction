This may seem weird but it's a genuine. It's fairly rare to find Straight Male Harry stories it certain Crossover sections, like Twilight which is one of the worst (I feel Vampire Diaries or The Originals is worst, legit under 10)

But after Soul Reaper Crewe reminded me of the Harry Potter/Twilight Section I decided to ask

Please share with me and other, Some Straight Male Harry/Twilight Crossovers.


** There are no "good" fics that are finished, featuring a straight Harry. I recently went through all completed fics with a wordcount of 20k+, hoping to find a Harry/Alice fic. To no avail.

â€‹

Twilight really is... inviting the strangest fanfictions. Mpreg, Rape/Angst/Torture/Soulbonding-WerewolfKnotting. Absurdly enough the majority of high word count fics feature the same tropes and are written by the same person.

If you are okay with badly written or unfinished stories,

  Harry Potter was the boy who lost too much and now he lost his mortality to save a life. So he fled the world he loved. Following the direction pointed by Dumbledore, he began the journey to find Carlisle Cullen, only to be distracted by a real-life Aphrodite he met on his way. warning: ANGST.

  Alice has a vision of a young man mortally wounded defending others. Not only by helping him will she help herself but her whole family as well. Together they take a journey of friendship and love and fight those that wish to destroy their family - I plan on going through all 4 twilight books - Main POV is Harry. Vamp!Harry/Alice. NO SLASH
