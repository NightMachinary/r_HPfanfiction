Read this long enough ago that I cannot remember enough to find it again. Harry was discussing with friends about the OWL exams and commenting on the fact that it was very hard to complete the full ward set in time for a particular exam and none of the others knew what he was talking about. Harry had studied extensively on his own (don't remember why) and even subjects that he did not take at Hogwarts (like Ancient Runes). He had gotten his hand on a copy of the Runes syllabus and did not realize that it was just a guideline and that the students in the class did not actually memorize the entire runic alphabets like he did. Turns out that if you do well enough on the tests then the magic involved unlocks the next tier of the exam and then the next. So Harry took his OWLS at the end of 5th year and ended up not only passing his OWLs, but also passing his NEWTS and gaining a mastery in several subjects. If I am remembering correctly Hermione did not take it well and I think Harry was asked to teach DADA in what would have been his 6th year. I think Hermione was very rude and argumentative in class. I hope I am not mixing up the details of different stories.
