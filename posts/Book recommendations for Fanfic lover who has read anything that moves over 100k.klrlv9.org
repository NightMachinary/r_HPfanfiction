I have read probably several hundred fanfics now and I feel like it is time to move onto 'proper literature'.\\
I am starting to get sick of repetition and need a fresh read.\\
Could you recommend me anything?


** Brandon Sanderson writes great fantasy books. I suggest starting with his Mistborn series. If you like Stephen King at all, his Dark Tower series is great too.

**** I highly recommend Warbreaker and Stormlight Archive after those, and there is also a book of short stories that are set in the Cosmere that are really good too.

** Mother Of Learning by nobody103 on fictionpress. Easy to pick up. Long and complete with a good plot.

Dresden Files simply because it has a "Harry" who constantly gets out of lethal situations with absurd amounts of luck.

Pact by wildbow: Complete web serial with a well developed magic system and a protagonist unluckier than HP. Dark.

**** Scifi I would recommend The Three Body Problem trilogy. Not sure if you fancy historical/fantasy fiction, if you do, I highly recommend Guy Gavriel Kay. My favourite author, every book of his is brilliant. You can start with any of his books apart from the Fionavar Tapestry.

**** I'm personally into mystery books, so if you'd like to check that genre out I recommend Agatha Christie. There's also Red Dragon and Silence of The Lambs if you wanna check out the horror genre. If you're into plays and all that, I believe Shakespeare never disappoints. As for sci-fi, I'm not exactly into it, but I read Ender's Game and it was good.

** If you're still interested in books a bit like Harry Potter than you might like the Percy Jackson series by Rick Riordan and the Septimus Heap series by Agie Sage.

Both series build their own worlds, include fantasy elements, have multiple novels and many well developed characters. I also just find them really good.
