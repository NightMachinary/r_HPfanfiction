I can't count the number of times I've started a really great fanfic that starts at year 1 then just stops. I feel like 98% of Fanfics only have 1 or 2 years (school years) then go dead! It's SO frustrating to find a well written story that leaves you hanging because it hasn't been updated in 4 year!!

Maybe I spoiled myself with Midnight Guardian linkffn(2052919) being my first HP Fanfic... It's not the highest quality (It's pretty decent compared to most fics though) but its FINISHED!! There is an ENDING. AND ITS GREAT!

So my question to this subreddit is.... What are some completed stories/series? I love the "What if?". Something that changes cannon from the very beginning.

(I'd prefer no slash! But you can suggest it for other people who will read this post. Just mark it please) :)


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Slytherin Selection) and linkffn(On The Way To Greatness) are the two best examples I can think of. They're well-written and have both reached the sixth-year mark, so that's a good sign, right? The first hasn't shown many signs of stopping, either.

  (1/7) At Madam Malkin's, Harry Potter introduces himself to Draco Malfoy. Draco offers to help Harry navigate the bizarre, new wizarding world, and Harry accepts. While Harry finds magic to be strange and amazing, there is no class to teach Harry about the complexities of friendship and social life in Slytherin... AU, Slytherin!Harry.

  Just how will Dumbledore cope with a Harry who is smart, knowledgeable, sticks up for himself and, worst still, is betrothed? A Harry who has a penchant for losing his temper? Ravenclaw/Smart(alek)/Lord/Harry Almostcanon/Dumbledore Non-friend/Ron Harry&Daphne (Haphne). No Harem. Rating is for language and minor 'Lime' scenes.
