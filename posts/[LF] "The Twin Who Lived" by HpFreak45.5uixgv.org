** It got archived on fictionhunt.com.

[[http://fictionhunt.com/read/4143789/1][Here you go.]]

But heads up, it's got 35 chapters, but it's not complete, and since it's been deleted from the author's page, it's likely to be perma-abandoned/hiatus.

*** Hahaha.. That was just awful. Hilariously awful if you limit your consumption to chapter 1.
