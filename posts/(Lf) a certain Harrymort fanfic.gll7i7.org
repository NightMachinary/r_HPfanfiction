I remember that Harry, Hermione and Ron went to this art gallery that the Malfoys made and in the last room there's loads of pictures of a boy with killing curse eyes but it's never a head-on shot so they can't tell who he is. Harry and Ron get freaked out because he looks like Harry, but Hermione doesn't think so.

The boy has something to do with a prophecy to do with Voldemort and Voldemort's kind of like the Grindelwald of their time. Also I remember Hermione being slightly obsessed over the tour guide.

If anyone knows what this fic is please please please let me know, it's been bugging me for ages. Thanks üôè
