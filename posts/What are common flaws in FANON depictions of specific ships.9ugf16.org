First of all, romance in canon is basically non-existent, so let's not even begin with it.

Basically, what are some relationships where the "common" portrayal in fanfics puts you off and what part does bother you? The purpose of this thread is not to bash ships, but point out the flaws/issues which put you off and discuss potential workarounds or solutions.

For example:

- Ron/Hermione never show their love through actions and fight all the time because "opposites attract". Ron also rarely gets his act together despite an abundance of events which could be used as catalyst (the attack on Arthur, the DoM battle, the poisoning incident, the Hogwarts Raid/Astronomy tower fight). Solution: Use one of those events to start slow changes.

- Harry/Ginny erases most of her OOTP character development and goes with the blushing fangirl instead of the strong young woman she was in the fifth book. Solution: Make Ginny more proactive, have her pursue Harry instead of waiting for him to make a move. Reject the fake break-up. Preferably also letters over the summer before the 6th year or some other event which strengthens their friendship.

- Harry/Hermione ignore most of Hermione's character development and go with the "or worse, expelled" characterisation from the first book instead of "let's curse the DA list and lead Umbridge in the Forest where she will be squished by a giant or gang-raped by centaurs". Solution: Write an actual character and not "Wikipedia on legs". Show her humanity, give her some passion (like canon SPEW).

- Tonks/Lupin: She takes him back after he does a runner, breaking his wedding vows 3 months into the marriage. Solution: Well, I got nothing for that one. Break them up and turn them into an example for loving divorced parents to show that people can still love their children, even if the marriage did not work out.

- Any Malfoy pairing: He does little to actually redeem himself and his past actions are glossed over because "he changed". Solution: He gets ten years in prison, which would also make his reformation a lot more believable. He also does something useful during the final battle.

Please no shipping wars


** Tonks and Lupin can be fixed by Lupin opening up. He has problems but won't talk about them. I can see a story of them falling in love again, as they get to know each other again.

*** Not after he did a runner. Broken trust cannot be fixed with a few words. If he does that before leaving, that would probably work out, although long-term self-pity might as well break the relationship.

But after he ran, Tonks would always have second thoughts about Lupin staying. Always wonder if he would come back. Always that small voice in the back of his head, doubting Lupin.

**** How much would you say Lupin does or doesn't deserve forgiveness compared with Ron? Lupin left his pregnant wife because he was afraid. Ron left his best friend and future girlfriend when they were trying to save the world because he was angry and jealous. (Yes, he was influenced by the horcrux, but Harry refused to let him use that excuse.) And yet Harry forgave him right away after he came back.

And would Lupin have realized how stupid he was after he had a chance to sleep on it like Ron did? ...Okay, on that, I admit even if he did, he wouldn't have had the nerve to go back.

***** Forgiveness as in "let's bury the hatchet?" Definitley. Neither did something evil after all.

But Forgiveness as in "let's get back together"? Not happening IMO, for neither. There would always be that doubt which cannot be squished, those lingering thoughts questioning everything. It would be poison for any future together, death by a thousand cuts. I see Ron/Hermione fizzling out after a weekend of debauchery since they have little in common either way and, as stated in the OP, Lupin and Tonks turning into a prime example of loving parents who happen to be divorced.

Edit: Nice to see that a question for "personal opinion" gets downvoted for expressing one.

However you've basically been implying it's absolutely impossible for any person to forgive and move on in the relationship after a betrayal because of your own feelings on how /you/ would respond. All I'm saying is there's plenty of people who would be able to move past what Lupin did. It's not impossible.

Edit: just wanted to add, if there was something specific about Tonks' personality that you pointed out which gave the impression that she's not the forgiving type, I might get where you're coming from. But at this point it just sounds like what I said earlier - that you're assuming based on your own feelings.

In OOTP she was a certified badass. She is the only kickass woman we see (Lily is offscreen and Hermione only turns 18 in the last book). And the whole Lupin arc took that away and turned her into a mopey pushover. The term character assassination comes to mind.

***** Neither do deserve forgiveness! Lupin is a coward who is always running (we see that when he resigns instead of fighting for his job - making the board fire him! He again is absent from Harry's life, not even sending Harry mail telling him stories about his parents etc., for years and the final straw? Leaving his pregnant wife! A wife he doesn't deserve - no, not because he's poor (though I question Tonk's sanity going with a guy who has nothing to offer...seriously, I don't like gold-diggers, but having kids when you aren't financially in a good place? No! Stop that shit ASAP!)...Hell, Lupin also wasn't there for Harry before Hogwarts! As far as we know he didn't even ask Dumbledore to be allowed to stay in contact with Harry - best friend of Harry's parents my ass! No wounder that a few believed he was a traitor, because he kind of is! Not a traitor of the cause, but a traitor to the people on the "light" side! He didn't kill anybody, but he wasn't there to help either! Harry could have used someone to talk to after Cedric died for example!)

And (Mo-)Ron? He's not much better! He always runs his mouth, no filter what so ever! He's a fair weather friend (with occasional bouts of bravery! Hell, in a way he's the Peter Pettigrew of the trio, luckily Voldemort didn't offer him something juicy like the team captaincy of the Chuddley Cannons (or even ownership of the team!))! He is lazy and ignorant (muggle culture! Hell, he had to confund his driving instructor because he was to stupid to learn how to drive!)

**** For me, Remus's actions are awful but I think context matters. Having a known werewolf for a father would immediately endanger the baby, as would having a known werewolf for a husband. They got married quietly, so if he left Remus may have assumed no one would know that Tonks was pregnant or even married him.

It's not the same as just running off because you hit a hard patch imo. It was wrong and stupid, but he felt horrible and went back. I also think people overlook how well, unhealthy, the relationship seemed to be. Tonks basically harassed Remus, who was much older, and then right after his best friend dies starts a relationship with him. If the genders were reversed, and one of my friends was going out with a guy who behaved like Tonks, I'd be side-eying them.

TLDR: Usually, with such a age difference, I would side eye the man for getting in a relationship with someone so much younger. But in this case, I think both sides were coming at the relationship in an unhealthy way.

TBF, I think Tonks should have ditched him, but I always saw it as a misguided, seriously dumb attempt at protecting her. Their quickie marriage/baby was so low key few knew, and if people knew Tonks was married to a known werewolfe it would have put her more in danger.

What you have is a middle aged man who did a runner. You know what he could have done? He could just have said no to Tonks. That is a relatively simple word. If he wasn't able to deal with having a wife and potential children, he could just have said no to her.

** Lupin ran out on Tonks because of his deeply held belief that he is a danger who makes life worse for everyone around him and doesn't believe that the people who love him could have weighed the pros and cons for themselves. Annoying, sure, but not something so deeply evil no one could ever forgive it. He was well on his way to fixing the problem just by coming back and (presumably) asking Tonks to take him back. It's not as if he was gone for years; at most it was a couple of months, and it could have been just a few days.

Fixing them starts with him proving he can stay and not run, can trust his partner/family rather than wallow in self-pity. I think the character came close to managing it in canon; no reason he can't in fanon.

He did make a good try at that when he ran off to live with werewolves rather than stay in the same timezone as her. When he got back he told her he was too old, too poor, etc., and half the Order of the Phoenix argued him into going for the relationship instead.

Is that necessarily true for every human on the planet in every conceivable circumstance? Or could there be something in Tonks' personality and personal history that lets her move past it?

She'd already continued to want him after the running away to live with werewolves stunt.

And yet Harry, for all of the not fighting (and I agree that Lupin did not cover himself in glory when he let teenage Harry do the vast majority of the emotional work in their relationship) summoned Lupin along with his parents and Sirius when he himself was dying. He could have said "parents and godfather only." He could have called Tonks if it was just about Teddy being orphaned. He didn't. Likewise Sirius, after being tortured for 12 years without Lupin questioning his guilt, immediately treated Lupin like a friend again. Canonically, there is /something/ in Lupin that leads people to forgive when he runs instead of fighting.

In the middle of a war? When he's spent his whole life being told that "his kind" don't have children? There are some pretty extreme extenuating circumstances. He may not even have been able to reconnect with her within 15 minutes if he'd wanted to, between the protective spells, their respective duties, and needing not to be seen as he went from place to place.

I think there was plenty of room for Tonks to cut him some slack if she wanted to. Obviously, she did in canon and could in fanon.

*** If you leave aside the stereotypical ambition and political wranglings aside, the Haphne Ship has a lot of potential, but ultimately ends up missing the mark in most cases. It involves two people from opposing houses with opposite ideologies (with each character presumably professing a strong belief in their respective ideologies). It doesn't come with any significant death eater baggage which ruins ships involving Draco for many. Also, the 'ice princess' trope is never really explored properly. I always saw it as Daphne's cold, brooding (maybe depressed) persona thawed by Harry's sheer warmth and cheerfulness. A long time back, I read this one-shot called Uncle Harry, I think, where Daphne (or possibly, Astoria) is married to Harry and the two visit Dudley, who's also married with kids with the catch being neither Dudley's wife nor his kids knowing that Harry and Daphne are magical folk. The interactions between Daphne, who's presented as having an icy temperament, still adhering to some muggle prejudices and often unsuccessful at hiding her magical powers, and Dudley's mischievous kids who find her to be this bizarre yet fascinating relative, makes for a great read.

After reading your answer I would like to recommend a few books to you, if you are interested in reading them, let me know. The world is not black and white. You will find very few people completely guilty and if you do, killing those will change absolutely nothing abbout what they have done. The families of people who have been murdered whose murderer received a death sentence are not even a tiny bit better off in the long run. The key is to stop people from doing further harm, that means in a lot of cases putting people into prison forever. But putting people into a torture prison, putting any thought about human rights away for now, with the intention of letting them out after a few years will have the opposite effect.

**** Malfoy does not deserve Azkaban. He was a kid with a figurative gun to his head. Any kind of deviation from Voldemort's orders would have resulted in both his death and the death of his family. That is canon.

His crappy, snobbish, and bigoted upbringing plays no role in this -- except a defensive one, because if you want to blame someone, blame the adults: his parents, pureblood society, and/or Dumbledore, who knew about his plan and yet allowed him to dangerously continue it.

I will, however, strongly agree with your point in the initial post, where /so/ many dramiones -- and this absolutely kills me -- butcher his character with a single "he changed." No! To make a realistic dramione, you need to show him question his upbringing, struggle against his bigotry, and also, the fic needs to make him illustrate re-fucking-morse! He was bratty and snobbish and a bully to boot -- for Hermione to fall in love with him (unless it's some eye-roll-inducing "bad-boy" attraction), there needs to be a strong reason why he's changed and different.

Regarding Hitler: your analogy is off. Hitler didn't force people to commit crimes under pain of death. Not directly, no. It was an institutional thing, with most crimes were committed willingly by Nazis who believed in his vision of a Aryan world.

That /literally does not matter/. Duress is not a defence to charges of murder or attempted murder (if they treat the problem as a criminal matter) or grave crimes against the laws of war (if they treat it as a civil war). It's even less of a defence when the duress is applied by a criminal organisation that the defendant actually joined. Legally, Malfoy should be going down for at least two life sentences, and his defence of "I was too much of a chickenshit to say no" shouldn't work in front of a sane court. Which, I grant you, isn't likely to be found in Wizarding Britain (the nonmagical side of things has some experience with trying and sentencing terrorists and generally doesn't stand for this kind of whining), and civil strife often ends with some entirely disgusting reconstruction/truth-and-reconciliation leniency deals, but legally, Malfoy's guilty of crimes that carry life imprisonment in peacetime and the death penalty during wartime.

Edit: I would like to add, that if I was juror in Malfoy's trial, then I would vote non-guilty, thereby nullifying any guilty verdict.

Edit 2: So I just looked at wikipedia (I know, I know) for duress qualification under American law. There's four.

1. The threat must be of serious bodily harm or death
2. The threatened harm must be greater than the harm caused by the crime
3. The threat must be immediate and inescapable
4. The defendant must have become involved in the situation through no fault of his own

So the only questionable element is number four. Here, Draco did accept the mark, but it was done after elements of brain-washing and coercion from his parents. He was lied to and manipulated from birth. As I see it, the duress defense stands.

I'm a lawyer and it is right. See, for example, R v Gotts (1992) 2 AC 412.

Summary of the case:

#+begin_quote
  The appellant, a 16 year old boy, was ordered by his father to kill his mother otherwise the father would shoot him. He stabbed his mother causing serious injuries but she survived. He was charged with attempted murder and the trial judge ruled that the defence of duress was not available to him. He pleaded guilty and then appealed the judge's ruling.

  Held:

  The appeal was dismissed and his conviction upheld.

  The House of Lords followed the obiter dicta statement from R v Howe & Bannister and held that the defence of duress was not available for attempted murder.

  The decision was based on the fact that it would be anomalous to allow the defence to attempted murder, which can only be established where the defendant has an intention to kill, whereas murder can be established with a lower level of mens rea since it can be committed by one who intends to cause serious injury.
#+end_quote

The principle behind it is that where the choice is between your own life and the life of an innocent, you should choose to lose your own life first. If this seems harsh, then I direct you to the case of R v Dudley and Stephens (1884) 14 QBD 273 DC:

#+begin_quote
  We are often compelled to set up standards we cannot reach ourselves, and to lay down rules which we could not ourselves satisfy. But a man has no right to declare temptation to be an excuse, though he might himself have yielded to it, nor allow compassion for the criminal to change or weaken in any manner the legal definition of the crime.
#+end_quote

As far as I'm aware, the position is similar in US law. From your number 2: "The threatened harm must be greater than the harm caused by the crime". There is no greater harm than murder, so it is impossible for the threat to be greater than it, therefore this requirement is not fulfilled.

************ That's fascinating, I did not know that. Thank you for the explanation.

Regarding the number 2 (where threatened harm must be greater), the way I interpreted it in Draco's case was 3 counts of torture and murder (him and his parents) vs. 2 counts of attempted murder (Katie Bell and Slughorn/Ron). Both by numbers and by the level of suffering involved that seems to weigh in Draco's favor; would that not be the case in the eyes of the law?

If the answer is no, then what would the following ethical quandary entail: say, a defendant had been ordered to murder one person; and if he/she didn't, then a larger number of people (let's say 10, but this number can increase) would perish. Would he/she still be guilty, per the reasoning in the Dudley and Stephens case?

In your /R v Gotts/, the boy is a victim of his father's actions, and then a victim of a sanctimonious verdict.

In your /R v Dudley and Stephens/, there are four distinct possibilities, without needing to read the case details. In what I will call possibilities A, B, and C, it was necessary for the survival of two of the victims of circumstance to kill and consume the third, with the only variable being which victim was chosen for consumption. In possibility D, necessity did not exist. Only if reality matched up with possibility D were the two surviving victims of circumstance culpable in any moral sense. Your law would appear to prefer that all three victims die, and your law is /wrong/.

DPP for N. Ireland v. Lynch (1975) Appeal Cases 653. Held that as an innocent's life holds as much value as the life threatened, the defendant cannot claim to be choosing the lesser of two evils, but is rather adopting the principle that the end (his own survival) justifies the means (murder, or attempt thereof, or close complicity therein) which is not a defence, it's an excuse and a morally disgusting one to boot.

(I remember studying this one as an undergraduate. Poor Lynch was ordered at gunpoint to drive three terrorists to the scene of them murdering a police officer. It got to the House of Lords - final appeal - before they allowed that 'aiding and abetting murder' permitted the duress defence while they had a gun to his head, but if he'd taken part in any more substantial way or if there had been any evidence that he'd been a member of their organisation, he wouldn't have been let off. )

Draco's situation is a little more nuanced, however. From the moment of his birth, he was surrounded by a cult-like organization that lauded very specific ideals. As a child, he grew to emulate these beliefs, as there was no realistic alternative whatsoever. By 16 (when the teenage brain is still developing), when he took the mark, he was simply following a course set in stone by his parents and surroundings. It's easy to critique his actions with the maturity of an adult removed from the situation, but in Draco's mind, there were no other options.

In addition, the specific elements of his 6'th year, where his family was held hostage, where he and his parents could have been tortured and killed at literally any moment; where this mind-numbing terror was prolonged for months, undoubtedly severely impacting his mental capacities; where even at the very end, knowing the full price of his actions, he chose not to murder, even though that would potentially entail the most extreme pain...I cannot help but sympathize with him.

He was a kid in an impossible situation, locked in by fate and circumstance. I feel that any competent defense attorney would bring these matters up in a trial, which makes me almost certain that if the judge and prosecution were denying any sort of defense based on his past and his circumstances then I wouldn't be the only juror voting "not guilty."

The boy does not deserve prison. He needs rehabilitation.

What you're describing is 'joint enterprise' - as the one who disarmed the victim for the one who threw the fatal curse, he's as guilty of murder as Snape (who is guilty of murder but with a significant circumstance in mitigation of the tariff he'll serve in prison, he might get out in as little as ten years).

And let us not forget that he made two previous attempts to murder his victim and nearly killed two, possibly five innocent bystanders (Weasley and Bell both nearly died, while Leanne No-last-name-given, Harry and Professor Slughorn were all nearly got as well for all they dodged actual harm by merest chance.) That's attempted murder and is at a minimum three counts, potentially as many as six (the five near-misses and the intended victim Dumbledore) and that's before you consider magical-world-only charges for the Unforgiveable Imperius curses he uses and the dark artefacts he attempts to deploy.

Bluntly, he'd racked up at least two life sentences, possibly as many as seven, before that night on the astronomy tower. His hesitation at the last is evidence that he knew what he was doing was wrong, not anything that can be counted in his favour.

I'll repeat what I said upthread: Malfoy was given a bloody tough bullet to chew, but it doesn't let him justify the means of murder with the end of his own and his family's survival. Having to die like a man rather than hang like a coward sucks, but it's not like there isn't precedent for kids from dark (ie inherently criminal) families leaving home and taking the disownment rather than be complicit in wrongdoing.

But a criminally-inclined subculture is not a cult, which is, effectively, what Draco was a part of. He was locked into an isolated community that venerated a terrible figure (they literally called him "The Dark Lord" and prostrated themselves) and perpetuated a very bigoted set of beliefs. How does a child run from that?

Well, nuanced, yes. But then a lot of cases are nuanced, are they not? I'm not advocating for complete forgiveness, but we shouldn't aspire to Hammurabi law either. In Draco's case, he was a child, brought up under cult-like circumstances, threatened with the torture and death of not only himself, but his family.

Also, there is a successful case of an affluenza defense in the United States, where a teen was given 10-years probation for killing 4 people in a drunk driving incident. And the circumstances for him were much lighter than Draco's.

However, maybe, legally, you are right -- you seem to be much more knowledgeable about jurisprudence than I am -- but I cannot help but reiterate that Draco's circumstances would be brought up by his defense, and I could not be the only juror affected by them. It is extreme, what he went through. In my mind, a just punishment would involve prolonged community service, where he would be forced to assist and aid the victims of his misguided ideology and actions -- not rot in a prison cell for the misdeeds of the older generation.

******************** Only luck didn't allow Dumbledore to do exactly this: he knowingly ignored all Draco's attempts to kill him that resulted in deaths of other students.

Also how did it go from Dumbledore planning his own death to sacrificing innocents? (and once again it was Dumbledore's plan to sacrifice Harry to make Riddle mortal. I'm not even talking about all who died, because the Great Wizard kept his plans in secret and put all weight of ending the war on teenagers).

As was established Draco was in situation without a way out (and death is not it). Dumbledore and the Light side refused to help him (it'll be better if you and your family die. Really?), authorities are useless (it was proved in the summer when Riddle took over in less than a month) and the Dark Lord himself was behind his shoulders.

In the end he didn't commit anything really serious (let's remember that Harry almost killed him using unknown dark curse that went way beyond self-defence) and still managed to save his life and lives of his family.

Yes, his views are shit. But it order to win the Light side did worse things than him (including usage of Unforgivables).

And judging a person because of his shitty views only is hypocrite... and may be not far away from becoming DE.

********** I don't think this position really captures the nuance of Draco's situation. Voldemort was practically a mythical figure (he's literally called the Dark Lord) and a mind reader that held his parents hostage. At any moment, he could order Draco to be brought before him and if he saw any hesitation (much less a plan to escape), it'd be the end for Draco and his family. Refusing such a summons (if Draco had, say, told Dumbledore and there was now a plan in motion to free his parents; highly unlikely) would yield a similar result.

And contacting the authorities is a non-starter; a number of them are either Death Eaters themselves or DE sympathizers or might even just have been placed under the Imperious curse. Any plea for help would be kaput.

That really leaves only Dumbledore as a viable option, and here Draco's terror, distrust, and animosity would preclude him from approaching the Headmaster.

At the core, I simply can't help but sympathize with a brainwashed kid who was put into an impossible situation. It's easy to dissect his actions rationally from a distance, but to him that year was months and months of mental (and sometimes physical) torture. Very few could live through that and still be thinking straight.

That's why I've always thought that Draco needs rehabilitation, not a prison sentence.

[[/u/Taure]] already gave a pretty good rebuttal to this in regards to the legal facts of the case.

I just want to add, that the kind of stuff that people like you usually cite in defense of Draco wouldn't apply to his guilt, but to the sentencing. If you put together his life story he is a perfect example of someone who you'd want to rehabilitate (if you don't try to rehabilitate Draco, you probably reject rehabilitation as a whole). So, when it comes to his sentencing, you'd try to show some leeway and find ways in which he and his victims can receive justice, but where the door remains open for him to become some sort of useful member of society at some point. For example after prison I'd like him to do some parole, in which he has to brew potions for long term Death Eater victims in St. Mungos. There's also systems of punishment where you only have to go to prison over night and on the weekends, which might be a viable option if he shows remorse and good conduct.

So in regards to his age and the circumstances of his crimes I'd definitely argue for some kind of leeway in the sentences, but it doesn't change in any way that he is guilty as sin for some heinous, indefensible, crimes

Where I'm from (Germany), I think it is generally accepted that the justice system tries to rehabilitate, and even here Draco (sentenced through juvenile law) would probably get 5-10 years for his crimes. Maybe he would be able to get out early on parole, depending on his behaviour.

When it comes to Azkaban, yeah, it's terrible and inhumane and if I were their dictator I'd close it down immediately - as I wouldn't wish that on anyone. But again, that's a different discussion.

Possibly. But you're not going to have a good nuanced argument with me about the morality of sending Draco to Azkaban, because I don't believe anyone should go there.

When I say "Draco should definitely be sentenced" I'm arguing from within the existing legal framework we see in the HP world. If, for instance, someone writes a fanfic where there was a huge reform of their legal system and Azkaban has been abolished, then obviously I'm not going to argue against Draco receiving a relatively light sentence. In reality though in most fanfics where Draco is paired with someone, he just never went to Azkaban because he's a special snowflake who doesn't deserve it.

Knowing that you're doing it to save the lives of people who, if they weren't under threat of death, /would entirely support those who are torturing and killing that child./

Yes, it sucks that Draco has to make that choice, but the instant you say it's OK for him to choose according to how he's threatened, you're taking the morally repugnant view that might makes right: he's allowed to commit crimes if sufficient force is brought to bear.

Fuck. That. Noise.

Death before dishonour is a tough bullet to chew, no doubt about it, but in a choice between a dead death eater and a dead innocent, he can die like a man or hang like a coward. If he wanted an easier life, he should've chosen better parents.

I like to think that after getting yelled at like that James just backed off for sixth year, took her criticism on board and became better, and then in seventh year they reconciled.

From a different perspective, James had to risk his own life in order to save Snape's stupid arse. Just because Snape decided to go after a werewolf on a full moon in an attempt to get Remus (who never hurt anyone) expelled. Imo the incident is proof that the bullying, while certainly over the top and unnecessarily cruel, was prompted by a two-way rivalry with Snape.

Firstly, there's little to no contextual evidence to suggest that, in canon, Harry's friendship with Hermione is any less meaningful or important to him than his friendship with Ron. He may get along with Ron better under perfectly-normal-slice-of-life circumstances, again, /in canon/, but friendship involves deeper dynamics than having a compatible sense of humour and being passionate about the same sport.

Secondly, even if it were the case that, in canon, Ron's friendship was more important or meaningful than Hermione's, a fanfic author writing the friendship dynamic differently would not be a /flaw/, it would be a /divergence/.

** The biggest fault in fanon pairings is making the pairing the story rather than having it an offshoot of an actual plot.

The Canon books aren't about Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione getting together, incidentally offing Voldemort in the process; it's the other way around.

The best stories are ones where two characters get together as they would in the real world - they meet, do stuff together, gradually get closer and eventually fall in love.

Take Jasmine (fem!Harry) and Merlin in linkffn(A Long Journey Home by Rakeesh), for instance. Or Harry and Gabrielle in (Vitam Paramus by TheEndless7). In neither story is the relationship the point, and in fact in neither story are the characters together at the end (excluding epilogues) but they're both excellent examples of how "pairings" can be done.

Quidditch is more dangerous than anything Umbridge did to Harry. It was stated many time in this subreddit and in canon (Fantastic Beasts) that tolerance of magical people are higher than muggles and therefore definition of "torture" is different for them too.
