That first story can shape the entire fanfiction for us. If it was a short one shot, in most cases that will be the next fic you search for. Same if the story was an epic of the best quality. My first fic ever was linkffn(3384712)

EDITS- Trying to link the fic with the new bot..

I was on vacation in croatia (~2009) and read it in the evening on my laptop because I had no other mobile device back then and the laptop was too shitty to use at any other time of the day. Plus, beaches and all :D I found it by naively searching for highly rated humour fics which were lightweight and silly because, yeah, beach vacation...

I also still remember walking, laptop in hand, to the public wifi hotspot to grab the next couple of chapters with some script I wrote because I had never heard of things like fanficfare and ffnet only allows online reading. Rather verbose explanation but I like thinking back to it :D

** I can't remember its name for the life of me, which goes for quite a few (first started reading them around 2002-3, really got into it c.2005). It was H/Hr, IIRC, and Dumbledore stole a Coke from Harry's mini-fridge in the Common Room.

There were several more after that, and I can't remember their names either. This is the earliest one that I can name:

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=133890][Love before Death]] by Harry_Potter

Read at your own peril. Strangely enough, the author's been plaigiarised more than once.

** linkffn(5921601)

Looking back, it's not a good fic, but it did leave me with a taste for the dark!Harry type fics. Revenge fics also rate high due to this and the second fic I read linkffn(5424980) which also, in hindsight isn't the best but still enjoyable.
