Did some searching, but couldn't find any other posts about what I'm looking for. Does anyone know of stories where Ginny and Hermione go properly head-to-head trying to win over Harry? Usually the author sets up one pairing and lets the other down either gently or roughly. I'd be interested to see them seriously compete for his affections (and his reactions, trying to keep the peace and work out how he feels about each of them, have the potential to be fascinating and hilarious).

it doesn't have to be nasty; friendly rivalry is fine too. Just so long as they've both thrown their hats in the ring and aren't backing down without a winner (and both have a serious chance).


** I'd read a story like this. Way too much of fanfiction either makes the 'loser' in romantic competition cartoonishly evil, or just ignores all possessive instincts human have and push a harem, which is nice wish fulfillment but completely absurd in reality.

There are probably very few people that *haven't* experienced jealousy over someone they are romantically interested in their real lives, yet it is one of the least realistically portrayed emotions in fanfiction. Weird.
