****** Basically, after the reader has slogged through 200k+ words, she gets to [[/spoiler][a dark, bittersweet ending. Three quarters of the way through the last chapter Daniel ambushes Harry, killing him suddenly with little foreshadowing, just "Blam, you're dead." Then there's the classic Purgatory and "We're sending you back in time" exchange that one finds in Peggy Sue stories /in the first few paragraphs./ Worse, Harry doesn't get to keep all his memories; half are gifted to the almost impossible to beat foe to "even things out" or some such. It's the literary equivalent of getting to the end of a film and having the last scene show that it was all a dream. And the protagonist wakes up, finding himself in prison with even less agency than before. As one who read the story as it came out, I found immensely unsatisfying.]]

Phew. Well, all of these are completed and are around novel length. Most of these I've come back to from time to time (though I usually just re-read certain parts). This could keep you busy for a while.

Just make a new thread when you're done with all of those, okay?

***** It's because of the whole 'mate' thing. Gabrielle has no actual agency in the entire story. Every single thing she does, she does explicitly because Harry wants her to. And that is horrific.

No matter how much the author tries to frame it otherwise, it doesn't matter purely because he set up a world where she literally is unable to 'disobey' him. And obeying him is gratifying. This is not the basis for a healthy relationship.

I know the author tries to say things like "The magic has allowed her her independence!" but with how everything is framed in the story, that is not actually the case because a stray thought can (and does) take that independence from her. So despite all of it, Harry still has the power to remove her free will in any instance. And even worse, she receives fulfillment from it.

Given that someone has complete control over another human being, and she is literally unable to do anything about it without debilitating pain, makes it really a terrifying situation. And worse, she's brainwashed into thinking it's all a good thing. Harry says repeatedly he won't fall in love with a doll but that is literally what he does. Their 'bond' isn't a two way thing. It's heavily one-sided toward the man.

Part of me kinda wants to write something similar but not hide the fact that it's horrific.

  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.

  AU. On that night, Neville Longbottom was the child that You-Know-Who marked as his equal. Surprisingly, Longbottom lived through He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named's Killing curse. Fourteen years later, the Boy-Who-Lived and Harry confront their destinies.

  The war didn't end when Harry and Voldemort fell. Hermione refuses to feel helpless any longer, and goes back in time to remove the scar that an unloved Tom Riddle left on the wizarding world. Tangled in the pureblood sphere, will Hermione just become another cog in Tom Riddle's plans? Final pairing is a secret! But not a Tomione. Lestrange OC. Parent!Hermione Child!Tom. COMPLETE!

** linkao3(Obscura Nox Animae by Heatherlly) is basically /the/ non-time-travel Snily fic and over 300k words.

linkao3(A Hero's Strength by FatherSnape) is a severely underrated mentor!Snape fic. Deals seriously with child sexual abuse, tho, so be warned.

And finally, for a series that isn't complete yet but already has more than enough to keep you busy for a while, the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/55402][Subjectiverse by potionpen]] has 12 complete works, over 780k words, and a very interesting portrayal of pretty much every one of the characters.

  The entire Wizarding world believes Lily Potter was murdered by Voldemort on that fateful night in 1981, including the man who would've given his immortal soul to save her. But there's another side to Lily's sacrifice, ancient charms and hidden truths that may have the power to change everything.
