*** I always think it would be interesting as to how Dumbledore would react - Sirius knowingly putting a student in very real danger for no other reason than Sirius didn't like him?

Would he cover it up? What would the reactions of Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs be if Snape suddenly ends up dead but there's no punishment for those involved?

AU. Summary: Sybil Trelawney made an earlier Prophecy. What would have happened if James hadn't reached the Shrieking Shack in time?

I always have trouble getting the bot, This is one of my favorite fics, Snape becomes a Hogwarts ghost, he's not happy about it. Warnings are at the beginning of the fic for those of you who pay attention to that kind of thing.

Edit: I always have to complain about the bot to get the bot.

** Frankly I think, if James didn't save Snape, Dumbledore would have. That a werewolf on loose once in a month and Dumbledore not checking security would be quite unbelievable. His school literary having one dangerous aspect in a certain criteria and nobody monitoring it doesn't make any senses to me. And why I consider - nobody knowing marauders becoming animagi and accompanying Remus on a fullmoon - as a plothole.

*** I think it's a sign that Dumbledore sometimes believes his own hype. So long as Lupin wasn't seen by anyone else and the Marauders stuck to the forest I think Dumbledore assumed that the security he put in place was adhered to. Or maybe he thought it was good for Lupin for his friends to provide that support and was overlooking the security concerns because students shouldn't be on the grounds - because teenagers are going to do what they're told

*** Well, I thought it was that the Marauders waited under the Cloak until Remus was escorted to the Willow. After he goes down the tunnel, and transforms, the others transform into their Animagi forms and follow suit.
