As the title says - it's for a fic I'm working on (that may or may not see the light of day) and the HP Wiki was fairly bare in the information. Is there a list of all combatants for the Battle of Hogwarts, potentially including the "fifty others" who died but aren't mentioned?

Mainly, given what it /looks/ like, the Battle really only consisted of Harry & Co., the Order, any potential Hogwarts students there at the time not evacuated or kept in the Slytherin Common Room, and Voldemort and his Death Eaters and Snatchers.

I just... did the people from Hogsmeade join the fight beyond Aberforth? I know Oliver Wood was there, but were any other players from Puddlemere? They attended Hogwarts at one point... what about Celestina Warbeck and the Wyrd Sisters? Assuming that once upon a time they had been Hogwarts students, wouldn't they join the fight, or is this the perfect example of wizarding apathy?

*PS* flairing as "misc" because I'm not sure this is going to generate discussion or not, given I'm just asking for a list.


** Generally, the HP lexicon is very reliable!
