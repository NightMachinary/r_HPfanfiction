I am currently writing a story about my own characters called the Lestrange Twins who are the children of Bellatrix and Rodolphus Lestrange. The boy twin is named Castor but I have no idea about the girl twin. Any ideas?

** In the myths, Clytemnestra was Castor's sister. Helen was his half sister, but considering Pollux was Castor's twin half-brother (and full brother to Helen), there's a lot of room for playing with names if you want the classical allusion.

*** Polina would be pretty close, it's originally latin-based, but nowadays you'll mostly find it in slavic countries. Funnily enough Paula would be the English (female) variation of it.

** Considering that Bellatrix was originally a Black, maybe Maia? It's the name of a star in the Taurus constellation. Or Seren, which means star in Welsh.

** Rabbit. Because Silly Rabbit, Bellatrix are for Kids.

Alternatively, Pollux. If you're going for Castor, why not go full Dioscuri and name the other one Pollux. Fate Grand Order has the Dioscuri Pollux a s a girl, so it can't hurt.

** We know the Blacks have a pattern of star names for their kids. Rabastan is also named after a star. We only know the names of two LeStranges in the books, Rabastan and Rodolphus, so they might have a pattern of R names. (Apparently there's a LeStrange in the Fantastic Beasts films, YMMV if that's canon). So...star and constellation names starting with R.

Reticulum, Ramus Pomifer, Robur Carolinum, and Rosa are all constellations or former constellations.

Rasalas (in Leo), Rasalgethi (in Hercules), Rasalhague (in Ophiuchus), Rabastan (in Draco), Revor (in Vela), Regulus (in Leo), Revati (in Pisces), Rigel (in Orion), Rotanev (in Delphinus), Ruchbah (in Cassiopeia), and Rukbat (in Sagittarius) are all stars.

Rhea is a moon of Saturn and Rosalind is a moon of Uranus.

Bellatrix might name her son after cousin Regulus who died gloriously martyring himself in the Dark Lord's service /shrug/. Otherwise I'd recommend Rigel or Revor for the son.

Rosa for the girl, except that as a former constellation with a strong Association to something else, people might not recognize it as a constellation name. Same problem with Rosalind. So Rhea or Revati for the daughter.

*** *[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyx][Nyx]]*

Nyx (; Ancient Greek: Νῠ́ξ, Nýx, [nýks], 'Night') is the Greek goddess (or personification) of the night. A shadowy figure, Nyx stood at or near the beginning of creation and mothered other personified deities such as Hypnos (Sleep) and Thanatos (Death), with Erebus (Darkness). Her appearances are sparse in surviving mythology, but reveal her as a figure of such exceptional power and beauty that she is feared by Zeus himself.
