I first started writing FanFiction in 2006. It was a time before Deathly Hallows. I think I stopped really writing in 2007, but continued to read. Most of the things I still read date back to 2006-2009. I actually started writing again because I haven't seen any recent stories with the themes I used to love. Anyone else notice trends changes in the HP fanfiction universe?


** What a great question.

I started reading / writing fan fiction in 2005ish. I stoped publishing in 2008 and stoped avidly reading in 2010. I started publishing and reading again last year (which has been the best decision I've made in a long time).

Prior to DH a lot of stories were about the final battle and much longer. People were writing novel length stories about what was going to happen. In contrast most of the newer things I read are less than 15,000.

Back in the day there were so many different types of stories. Poems, song fics, art accompanying, drabbles etc. I see a lot less fan art in general. Maybe it's just the sites I use now. Idk.

Communities were based in ships. It was so easy to join a group of like minded people and all have the same opinion about what should happen. Now the community is much much smaller and general. On this site I see much more diverse opinions (about ships, character opinions, plot opinions)

Re entering the fandom, the quality of writing seems to have increased was well as the age of writers. I don't know if it's just that I'm just more selective about what I choose to read, if the types of stories I read now attract stronger writers or if there's just been an increase in quality.

A lot of stories today deal with mental health.

I see a lot less Hermione/everyone. Hermione seems to be liked a lot less in general. Also (aside from Drarry) a lot less Draco.

Slash is just as decisive as ever.

These trends may all simply be the result of my age changing and the sites / interests I had then in contrast to the media I consume now. All that being said I think the fandom really has matured and those who write are in general older and we aren't gaining as many younger folk.

it's probably a little bit of both. but right now, harry potter isn't really attracting younger people. I would assume that most of the people writing/reading fanfiction now are the ones who were reading/writing it when deathly hallows or the last movie came out. so it's possible those people have gotten better at writing. and probably the older you are, the better at writing you're going to be as you have a larger vocabulary and more knowledge.

*** Thanks for the reply. I was on/off in the community so for me it seems like a stark change which makes getting back a little daunting.

Unlike back in my high school/college years I think I know find more time as I have a 1.5 hour commute each way every morning. I've been able to consume the longer stories because of the read audio feature.

I think also with PotterMore and fanwikis it gives better access to data. It has been a lot easier to build worlds based on the books. Also, I feel that since more is known I have to research to ensure things are plausible.

** Well, there is the [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/169NVDxmtgDuwB7O1rZenT_WfKWTJqs-k-cdxd37xHWw/edit][100 Most Recommended Fics]] on this sub.

It's characterized by:

- Adventure over romance. The highest ranked romance centric fic, "Grow Young With Me", comes in at #34.
- Canon pairings and canon compliant fics are not favored. Disregarding "Seventh Horcrux", the highest ranked fic with canon pairings is "Divided and Entwined" at #13. The highest canon compliant fic is "Strangers at Drakeshaugh" at #37.
- Ruthless protagonists who compile a large body count are preferred. The main characters of ALL top ten recommended fics could be considered either 'gray' or 'dark'.
- "A Black Comedy" and "Delenda Est" have been among top ten since 2014.
- I don't think there is a single Dramione or Drarry fic on that list.
- Slash fics are not popular. The highest male slash fic I can identify is "Again and Again" at #86.

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
