Imagine a Harry Potter story with no dark lord equivalent. So no super strong nearly unkillable bad guy to beat.

You can still have like bad guys. The bad guys can still like hate magical creatures and muggleborns. They can still be numerous and strong/skilled and intimidating.

But their strength isn't like out of the ordinary op like Voldemort is. Each individual bad guy can be killed like any other person.

What would you make the plot?


** I would love to read a "Conspiracy" story.

In Magical Britain, a group is working from the shadows in order to take control of the country. Their goal : restore the traditions and put the Mudbloods back in their place. Intidimidation, Theft, Murder . . . nothing is too much for their ambitions.\\
During this time, Harry Potter, a young orphan is coming back into the Magical World and entering "Hogwarts, School of Wizardry", hoping to find the truth about the murder of his parents.

​

Basically, the Canon Death Eater are all members of a conspiracy which has pretty much the same goal than in Canon (without Voldemort at the helm). They are working into putting their members into position of power to prepare "a coup". To do so, they are helping each other legally, by financially supporting each other and networking; but also illegaly but making their opposition "dissapear". The conspiracy is already pretty powerfull, but some key positions still elude them, including the "Ministry for Magic" and "Headmaster of Hogwarts" (still held by Dumbledore).

In this AU, Harry could still be an orphan after having his parents murdered by the conspiracy (maybe Peter tried to recruit them and, after his failure, was forced to eliminate them). Entering into Hogwarts, Harry could first be confronted to the Conspiracy by discovering one of its member, who was trying to murder Dumbledore to become Headmaster (either Snape or whoever is the Teacher of DADA I guess). After this, Harry and the friends he made along the way could try to dig deeper, and discover the conspiracy that ran deeper that any of them could have imagined.

​

I like this idea because it's close enough to Canon to not sound weird (the bad guys are basically the same, and even the Dark Mark can be recycled as a symbol of affiliation to the Conspiracy) while being different enough to not be Canon rehash. No Philosopher' Stone or other idea to copy (though some, such as the Chamber of Secret, still have potential). And, while the "Conspiracy" in itself can seem invisible (at least at first), each of its individual members are "normal" witches and wizards, that can be taken down one by one.

The only "problem" would be that Harry (or whoever is the MC) would have to be adult inside this story because outside of "The teacher", and maybe one or two others (such as the parents of another student), it would be difficult for Harry to investigate the Conspiracy and its members while still a student.
