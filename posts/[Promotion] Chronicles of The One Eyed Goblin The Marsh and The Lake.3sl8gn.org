I'm looking for feedback on a little side-project I've started.

The Chronicles of The One Eyed Goblin are a series of vignettes which grant a glimpse into the life of "ordinary" witches and wizards. Criminals, Ministry workers, lovers, hunters, potion makers, artists, officers of the law, shop owners, the misguided, the foolish,and the hopeful all congregate to share their dreams, fears and anxieties.

I'm writing these as practice for writing. Some authors recommend and others deride writing fan-fiction, but I decided that the worst that could happen was that I would have some fun. But to help with the practice side of things, I decided to follow a couple of self-imposed rules:

1) Stick to the canon: I know, I know, half the fun in fan-fiction is coming up with the things you wish to see. But to challenge myself, I decided to follow canon as much as possible, this forces me to do research before writing, which is a good skill to develop.

2) Consistent tone: I wrote this as if I was presenting it to bloody Bloomsbury for publishing. So I tried to not stray too much from the original book's tone, without copying the style, of course.

If you had read this far, thank you for your patience. Your feedback would be welcome.


** Followed it. I enjoyed it! But why do they all need to be attractive and why do we need to know about it? It seems like the physical descriptions of the characters took up a bunch of the chapter. The dialogue is a little wooden.

How much have you planned out?

*** Hi! Thank you so much for your feedback. Had to google wooden dialogue, but I see what you mean. It was a struggle to write it, and it was never quite there, I felt it was too much telling and not enough showing. So I'm definitely going to go read some more on how to improve dialogue.

As for the characters, you're quite right. Originally this was going to be a full story of at least novella length. It was while writing it I decided that it was too ambitious and decided to turn it into a series of vignettes instead. And I think that because in my mind that characters are fully fleshed, they sort of ended up half-baked in the story itself and my mind filled the blanks that were left. So I'll keep my eye out for that. Funnily enough, my original vision was that Sibelius and Almena are actually normal looking but have a more intense and serious demeanor, while Rasvan is more of a charmer. Obviously, this was not communicated well.

As for how much I've planned, I've the skeletons of 3 more pieces, and I'm planning to keep it between 4 and 5, with each clocking at around 3000~4000 words.

Again, thank you for feedback, it's much welcome.
