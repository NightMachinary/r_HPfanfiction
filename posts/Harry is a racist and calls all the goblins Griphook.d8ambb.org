*** No

Griphook is referred to specifically and targeted for murder. While Harry hates the Goblins in general in that fic it isn't the one being asked about.

This Harry was a racist, just not explicitly towards Goblins.

***** Now let's look at the entire quote shall we?

#+begin_quote
  'Grave-robbing is such a distasteful term,' Harry thought to himself as he excavated the Riddle family cemetery. 'What is it that separates this from the noble Gringotts employees that loot the tombs of Egyptian kings? The time perhaps?' Harry wondered, 'or perhaps because Egyptians were a bunch of Wogs that didn't deserve to keep what they couldn't hold?'
#+end_quote

In context Harry is questioning how society views digging up their graves version the graves of a long dead culture, he is not expressing his own views about people from that part of the world.

The irony is that Harry could be considered racist against Goblins, it's just justified in this setting. The only thing I said was that this wasn't the fic being asked for.
