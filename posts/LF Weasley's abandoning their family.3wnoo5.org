To clarify that I am looking for the other Weasleys (mostly the younger generation, though Bill and Charly, too) abandoning their parents (can be done as revenge for having grown up poor (I mean wizards probably do have contraception, do they? - So why have more kids than you can really afford to give a good life without hand downs (come on wands for example should really not be hand downs as that probably hampers magical growth or at least makes learning that much harder!)) or any other way, including disagreeing with the adults always siding with Dumbledore (even when he's clearly responsible for Harry being abused for example)

ps: Only Molly being abandoned is ok, too (I kind of like Arthur and pity him for having her as his wife -.-)

pps: Stop the downvoting - just because you like the Weasleys (hell, I like most of them, too - the exceptions being Molly and Percy, all others I do like! Ok, and Ron - but not because he's a Weasley, it's because IMHO he's a bad friend and of the things holding Harry back (others being Hermione and her attitude, his upbringing (can't outshine Duddley who's not the brightest light there is), his surroundings (Hogwarts isn't that conductive to learning IMHO) and having his life threatened every year!))


** You love your paranthesis don't you? You missed one closure tho. For fic there's linkffn(backwards with purpose) which is the closest one i can come up with.

  AU. Harry, Ron, and Ginny send themselves back in time to avoid the destruction of everything they hold dear, and the deaths of everyone they love. This story is now complete! Stay tuned for the sequel!

*** Yeah, I do love them - bad habit, I know -.- (ADHD helps that habit along as I write stuff and always try to fit the maximum amount of content into a sentence - without restructuring it again and again -.-), still:

Thanks, I'll check it out :)

  Set after the COS. See how Harry Potter's story will change, with Ginny being Sorted into Slytherin. A Ginny who is not going to be a victim, and a Harry who realises those closest to him may not have his best interests at heart. Major Molly/Ron/Dumbledore bashing, some Hermione bashing. Rated for later chapters.

  When an imperiused Ron destroys all bonds between the Potters and the Weasleys, Ginny is left with a terrible choice: disown herself and keep loving and supporting Harry from afar, or be forced to hate him against her will. Grey!Harry, eventual H/G Complete

  62/? When Harry Potter starts coming into his full wizarding powers too early, what better way to stabilize his magic than a full marriage bond? Certain Weasley brothers can't stand to see Harry manipulated any longer, and suddenly plans change. Eventual Harry/Charlie, Fred/George, Sirius/? Begins after Harry's fourth year, but only VERY loosely follows plot after that point. Abuse
