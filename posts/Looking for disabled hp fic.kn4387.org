:END:
Hi,

i‘m looking for a fic where harry is disabled as an adult. Either deaf or mute as the fic involves sign languages. things I vaguely remember.

-harry's kid goes to hogwarts, harry pretends to be a muggle and uses a different name. I think his wife died.

-something happens (no clue what) and harry goes to hogwarts, is met at the train platforn by a student who uses sign language. At hogwarts, Severus recognizes him as harry because of harry‘s snake crawling on him (in the teachers lounge?)

-he's somehow listening to music with headphones.

hopefully this helps. Thank you :)
