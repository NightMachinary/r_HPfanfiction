I cringe everytime I see fics where Voldemort is referred to as Voldy or worse; Moldyshorts. It's not even funny.


** I /hate/ when characters shorten a two syllable name to one, like "Lily" to "Lils" or---and I swear to Christ I could slap writers who do this one--- "Harry" to "Harr". Even if it's played for laughs, I'm not laughing, you're just shortening my lifespan by making me read such nonsense.

**** I have a friend named Alex. She gets the reverse. Her parents explicitly named her "Alex" rather than "Alexa" or "Alexandra" or something like that because they figured everyone would shorten it anyway, but then people, trying to be formal, will guess and extend it to one of those longer names. It drives her mad.

** I cringe when multiple characters refer to Hermione as "Mione", and she just goes with it.

1. Ron only did that when he was eating, and Hermione told him off for it.

2. Hermione is strict on proper names, calling Ron "Ronald", and teaching Viktor, syllable by syllable, how to pronounce her name.

But none of that is as weird as Hermione being called "Mia" with no explanation.

**** It happens a lot in Dark!Slytherin!Hermione fics, where the authors try to detach Hermione from everything that Canon!Hermione was about.

They get rid of her muggle dentist parents and make it so she was a pureblood or halfblood all along, change her personality by making her beautiful, charming, and seductive without effort, and get rid of Harry and Ron as her BFF's because they're useless and holding her back.

It's the Hermione equivalent of Harry going Dark and changing his name to Hadrian Potter-Black-Peverell and rejecting his parents as dumbasses who were tricked by Dumblefuck and his Order of the Flaming Firechickens.

*** It could be and it must be done in style. In linkffn(4236594) Daphne Greengrass (who is most definitively NOT a Scioness Greengrass, her mind and tongue are constantly close to gutter) tries to avoid Taboo by calling Tom Riddle names, and she is very creative and very disgusting. Other DA members (yes, she is a Slytherin in DA) try to match her names. However, it is in style of her character and pretty funny.
