*** edit: shit I just read another post and realized what I describe is pretty much canon and not my idea.

​

I'm not certain what you mean by this, but it sparked in me the idea of a Remus who has been struggling with mental health for a long time. he was stable in hogwarts because of his friends. but the death of James, Lily, and Peter + the betrayal of Sirius plunged him into a deep depression. with magic it's not that difficult to just barely stay alive, or maybe Dumbledore helped him. and Dumbles tried to help over the years. nothing helped, until he asked Remus to take over the DADA course after Quirrel died. this was the spark that got him out. he didn't get back into shape quickly enough for Harry's second year, but Dumbledore promised him third year and that kept him going. so he spent Harry's second year reading a lot, preparing his lessons plans, and getting healthier in general.

** The likely explanation is that JKR did not invent this character until POA.

The in-story explanation is that Lupin was too depressed and felt too sorry for himself to take care of Harry. This man had a long record of running from difficult realities and major responsibilities. For example, he ditched his wife because he was paranoid about that his unborn child might be a werewolf. It took a thorough verbal thrashing from Harry to set him straight.

*** "Felt too sorry for himself to take care of Harry" is a perfectly valid headcanon, but it is NOT the in-story explanation. There is no in-story explanation. What IS in-story is Dumbledore's desire for Harry to stay with Lily's blood relatives to keep an extra level of magical protection around him. What IS in-story is mass fear of werewolves that keeps Lupin from finding a job to support himself let alone a child... and Harry being a wildly famous baby whose placement with a dark, dangerous creature could create public chaos. What IS in-story if Lupin being too physically ill to handle a baby by himself.

​

There's also no in-story suggestion that Harry was ever Lupin's "responsibility." Sirius was godfather/guardian. Lupin was a family friend. Friends aren't automatically "responsible" for their dead friends' children, particularly when legal guardianship goes to a close blood relative... who happens to hate everything about the surviving friend's culture.

​

There's also no indication that his fear that his unborn child might be a werewolf was paranoid. Werewolves don't normally have children; how could he know what was going to be passed along genetically and what was not? Sounds like a pretty valid fear to me.

​

I'm all for people hating Lupin or any other character they want to hate. I'm not for presenting headcanon as fact.

**** Lupin had no legal obligation towards Harry. But he certainly had one of honour due to his friendships with Lily and James, who were brutally murdered and their child placed with the sister/sister in-law who despised them. Also, Lupin clearly avoids Harry, just look at their interactions in PoA. Especially using the "throwing away their sacrifice" line. Lupin makes it clear that he knew them better than he firsts admitted, but still refuses to tell Harry anything about them.

Therefore [[/u/InquisitorCOC]] certainly put things bluntly, but his statement is in line with what we know about Lupin in canon. Which is the best reply you can get in this thread since the books don't mention what Lupin was doing while he was avoiding Harry.

**** You have my personal gratitude for this comment, especially for the part about Remus not being legally responsible for Harry. As nice as it might have been if he had taken care of him, it seems like people are determined to attack each and every character for something they absolutely had to do, and this applies to Remus in particular. It's a bit tiring by now.

*** My proof that she had already had Remus, Sirius, and Peter planned out from the beginning is the spell that Ron tries to cast on Scabbers.

"Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow. Turn this stupid fat rat yellow!"

​

She may have changed the way spells work since then, but I firmly believe that at least one of the reasons the spell didn't work is because it wasn't a rat, it was an Animagus. The idea of the Animagi was planted from the beginning with McGonagall, first of all, and second of all, it's so integral to the plot that I can't believe it wasn't designed from the beginning.

That clearly wasn't a real spell, it was his brothers pranking him. Hermione even says it doesn't sound like a real spell. Which makes sense because it's incantation isn't anything like the ones for actual spells.

** Okay I might be making this up but like other posters said he was super depressed after James, and supposedly peter die and then Sirius is dead to him after being the cause of his friends dying and Harry being orphaned. So everyone besides his family (not sure what's up with them but I'm assuming they're dead too) who knows about him being a werewolf and supports him is gone in an instant. Similar situation to Sirius except he doesn't even know the full story.

My guess is that he had trouble getting jobs / keeping jobs due to the wolf thing. Probably couldn't get any respectable ministry job. He couldn't think that he was even the best option for Harry at that point, barely able to take care of himself. I also figure he always blamed himself for what happened.

I'm sure he just lived a sad life until he saw that Sirius had escaped and he realized that he was the only one who had a chance to save Harry.

This answers nothing but someone should really write a fanfic explaining what he was up to.

** My headcanon is that Remus was advised against meeting Harry in person, because Harry is supposedly hidden at a secret muggle location away from the wizarding world.

Therefore, he contents himself with sending letters, photos and birthday gifts through owl post. However, Harry gets no mail at all. Remus ends up concluding that Harry doesn't want to keep in touch with him... After all, he is a dark creature... who would want him?

There are no anti-owl wards mentioned in canon, /yes/, but even Hermione gets hate mail during the Tri-wizard Tournament; why doesn't the Boy-who-Lived receive any mail from fans? Either they are destroyed or diverted to some unknown location, and in the latter case somewhere there are dozens of letters from Moony. (/and also from Ginny Weasley and Romilda Vane ;-)/)

******* Actually, lily was quite Mischievous in canon. She disobeys her mum's rules by being reckless and is really cheeky with Slughorn. I don't think she was the 'responsible' one of the group. And she was immediately sorted into Gryffindor which might mean she's the perfect example of a Gryffindor with flaws and all, including being reckless.

** There was a great fic of Remus getting over depression from his friends getting killed etc., getting his acts together, falling in love to OC and getting married, inventing Wolfsbane Potion, organizing a community using it inside of St. Mungo, it slowly all seems to make sense, and then his wife is killed by Dolores Umbridge (the main anti-werevolf, anti-Wolfsbane Potion villain) using a dementor. Suddenly, in few days his world crumbles, and the final blow happens on September 1, just before he boards the train to teach in Hogwarts (he was sleeping in the train, because he was completely exhausted from the drama of last few days). However, I cannot find it now. Does anybody have a clue what it is?
