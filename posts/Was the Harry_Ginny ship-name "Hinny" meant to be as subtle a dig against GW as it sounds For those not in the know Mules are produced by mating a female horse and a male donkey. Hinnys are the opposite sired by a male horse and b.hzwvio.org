#+TITLE: Was the Harry/Ginny ship-name "Hinny" meant to be as subtle a dig against GW as it sounds? For those not in the know: Mules are produced by mating a female horse and a male donkey. Hinnys are the opposite: sired by a male horse and birthed by a Female Ass.

** I remember pointing out the same thing in a "dumb ship-names" thread.

I don't /think/ it was an intentional dig, but all the same I refuse to use the ship-name because of what it means.

** No, it's just a coincidence. Keep in mind the name was created BY Hinny shippers, so it probably isn't a dig against their own ship.
