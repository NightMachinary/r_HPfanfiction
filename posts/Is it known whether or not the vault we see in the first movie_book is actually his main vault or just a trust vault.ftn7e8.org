I want to know mainly due to a lot of fics claiming it as Harry's trust vault that only has like 0.0001% of his actual inheritance or something

I personally don't remember it as being his trust vault or that it was ever mentioned that there would have been another vault.


** The vault we see in the movie/book is just "his vault."

That's it. There is no indication that it's merely the portion of his inheritance he has access to as a child. There is no indication that it's the entirety of his inheritance.

Personally, I'm inclined to believe that's it, what's in the vault is the sum total of his liquid assets in the wizarding world. While it doesn't make much sense from a muggle point of view to give an 11 year old completely unfettered access to the entirety of their inherited wealth, it isn't /in/ the muggle world. Our sensibilities don't come into it.

But from a muggle point of view it also doesn't make sense that it's a trust vault. Where's the trustee? Why can harry literally scoop out as much (or as little) gold as he wants with zero accountability for what he spends it on? It's a fairly reasonable assumption that it costs something to go to hogwarts, but that's never addressed /either/ so we don't even know if he's responsible for paying for his own schooling out of the vault.

Even if the bulk of his inheritance is held in trust (or locked up in probate) and that's just his "allowance" vault that /still/ doesn't make sense. It's way too much money to be an allowance, even after lying fallow for a decade.

No matter how you cut it, the vault simply doesn't make sense. It's simply too much money to be a stipend, there's no access controls on it aside from what is hopefully standard "only the customer can access their own money" account restrictions so it can't be a money held in trust, and what society would give 11 year olds unfettered control over their finances?

The only thing that makes even the slightest bit of sense is that wizards don't have an age of financial responsibility and so 18 months old orphans get full control over their financial assets.

Minor point: It's "tweet-canon" that Hogwarts has no tuition (it's publicly funded by the Ministry), and it's also implied in HBP - when Tom tells Dumbles he doesn't have money, Dumbles mentions a Hogwarts fund for students to buy secondhand "books and robes", notably not mentioning a tuition.

*** I'd like to think that vault wasn't all the money they could gather in over 700 years of Potter family fortune growing and seeing the Lestrange vault really gave a sense of scale.

I'd like to think that the vault we saw was Harry's school fund which was very generous and left money for a mastery or two, it really really doesn't make sense that the only assets we see of the potters are that vault and the destroyed cottage in Godric's hollow, there is almost certainly a bigger vault filled with enchanted objects, paintings, jewellery and a load of galleons.

Though the amount of galleons we see suggests more that it is a vault completely dedicated to potter childrens schooling and the like, which to me would make the most sense

**** I remember reading an article where someone calculated how much wealth was in his vault and it was insane. It was based on the movie, of course, because we don't actually have the slightest clue how much he has in the books, it seems to have been deliberately vague.

"Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts. “All yours,” smiled Hagrid. All Harry's --- it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn't have known about this or they'd have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London."

It actually sounds like a lot less than in the films from this description though, aside from the "columns of silver." Which sounds like there's just huge pillars of silver holding up the ceiling.

Do we know the potters were actively accruing wealth? Their could've just been enough savvy inventors to keep the family able to live comfortably, could be most of them were lazybones.

That's . . . not how money work. You don't gather money just to fill a vault for the future generation, you gather money in order to live more confortably. If you earn more money you can live in a bigger house, wear better clothes and so on. Usually, you just keep a part of your money in case of problem but it's not supposed to be a big part of it.

As for the 700 years, and so what? It just takes one bad generation (someone who liked to drink too much, or was a betting man, or just someone who did some unlucky investments) to completely ruin a familly, and it can just take one generation to become rich (Fleamont Potter is supposed to have quadrupled his familly forturne thanks to his potion.

Also, being an old, pure familly doesn't mean anything. I remember reading a study explaining that, if you are Western European, you are almost assured to have Charlemagne as one of your ancestors. But even if the wealth of Charlemagne still existed (that's not the case), I would probably be ranked somewhere in the millionth in the inheritance and would never see the money. I mean, the Gaunts were direct descendant of Slytherin (and probably the main branch or the closests of a now extinct one), and yet they were still paupers in canon.

Finally, the "Sacred 28" just come from one book written anonymously by one guy (suspected to be a Nott) at the start of the XXth century. It not only doesn't have any "proof" (the Potter were Pure at that time, but not included in the list because their name sounded Muggle and they were judged too much in favor of Muggles), but being part of it doesn't mean you are rich. The Weasleys are included in the 28 but are poor (though I guess they /may/ have had money at the time it was written, but the Gaunts are also in the list and they definitively already paupers.

******* The thing is though, that all we see of the potter family is a small vault with a pile of galleons and a destroyed cottage that's been turned into a tourist attraction, that really doesn't give any idea of how they lived, but I would almost bet that they had a bigger house somewhere unless it got burned during a war or something, if not that then another vault. Besides Rowling describes the vault we see in PS as having ”mounds of gold, pillars of silver sickles and piles of knuts” or something but they are all implying more than one, which is definitely not what we see in the films

There probably were a few potters who liked to spend a lot and not contribute anything or contributed very little, but I still think the vault we see is either very understated or is not the main vault, I got an idea that the vault we see is a school fund for potter children over all

There is a large chance there are other vaults for the other branches of the potter family like the one that went to the states as soon as possible and probably some branches on the mainland

I don't think the sacred 28 matters much to be honest

** 1. Strictly speaking we never ever hear about anybody having a trust vault, even less we hear it about the Harry's one. As far as the canon is concerned this vault (and perhaps the house in the Godric's Hollow) is all Potters' property we ever hear about.

2. The only possible allusion in the canon, that it actually might be some smaller part of the Potters' fortune is that in the other vault we see, the Lestranges' one, there are tons of other things than just money. Jewellery, paintings, stuff. In the Harry's vault there are just coins. Which seems to suggest that either Potters' were not that wealthy and it is really everything they had, or there is some other family vault and this was just small heap of coins for his studies.

Technically speaking, the only thing they can't conjure, charm, or transfigure for themselves is food, and with expansion charms the interior of a shack could be a palace. I'm fairly certain that the Potters are pretty similarly wealthy to the Malfoys, they just /prefer/ not to spend their money on mansions/bribes, if only because their only necessary expense would be food and school supplies. James never had a job, and neither he nor Harry ever struggled financially.

Remember that in fourth year, Harry handed over 1000 galleons that was sufficient enough to start a brick and mortar business, and that had he added it to his vault instead it wouldn't have even made a noticeable difference.

********** Not really, no when you think about Grimmauld Place - the DEs stand outside and clearly know it's there and suspect Harry and co are inside, but they can't do anything about it, they just stand there and watch. Sirius would have already owned it when it went under the FC too, and that probably would have been known about by the Ministry. Plus I think Bill and Fleur had already moved into Shell Cottage when they out the charm on there - though I grant you the rest of the Weasley's upped sticks and fled to Muriel's. The FC in general is confusing and inconsistent.

Either way, the Potters strike me as one of those quietly wealthy, middle class families in the very nice old cottages you find in posh parts of rural England. If you look up the actual cottage they used for filming, I think it's slightly bigger than what I'm imagining but the right sort of vibe and that was recently on sale for over a million. I think for the sort of house I'm imagining in a quaint west country village, you'd be looking at something like 600k to 850k for a little period cottage with 3 or four bedrooms. In my headcanon, Mr and Mrs Potter were getting on a bit and handed the house down to their son while they moved into the old people's home or somewhere more manageable without stairs, perhaps as a wedding present like you said. I think they had also perhaps been living off the fortune for a while, not to mention James doing the same until he died, though I'm sure he intended to get a job once the war was over, so although there was plenty left for Harry by the time they died, it's not Malfoy levels of oppulence.

I think so much of these type of headcanons come from how we personally view wealth and the level where that wealth starts to feel unpleasant. But as you say, it's worded very vaguely, so it really is down to us to imagine it how we want.

Harry's vault IS the main vault. Fic writers just assume its the trust vault because they want to make Harry have billions of Galleons and have a seat on the Wizengamot... even though that amount of money in Galleons is absurd, and the Wizengamot does NOT have inherited seats. Individual people have seats on the Wizengamot, but that does not trickle down to their family, and it sure as hell isn't exclusive to pure-bloods either. That's a whole other topic, though.

I honestly doubt most fic writers understand basic economics, since if they did, they would realise why a society like the wizarding world wouldn't have billionaires or trilionaires. That much can be gathered from how stuff is priced. At most, rich families (e.g. Harry's canon vault, Malfoys, and Lestranges) might have around 50 million galleons at the absolute most, but that's an ridiculous estimate. Given the Ministry had a bounty of 10,000 Galleons on Sirius' head (OOTP) and a bounty of 200,000 Galleons for Harry alongside his wand, I recon the very richest wizarding families each only have between 1 million and 20 million Galleons at most. 200,000 Galleons is presented as a big deal (hell, the 5,000 Galleons for the Triwizard Tournament was deemed by Fleur enough to die for), so its quite possible the wizarding world might not even have millionaires.

Long story short, Harry's vault in canon is the Potter's vault. There isn't another vault, and the idea of trust vaults makes zero sense. The idea of wizarding billionaires is economically absurd, and even the idea of wizarding millionaires makes barely any sense unless its below 20 million galleons. I feel like people don't realize just how much even 1 billion Galleons really is. So while I think Harry was canonically a millionaire (and moreso after inheriting money from Sirius), I don't think it was nearly as much as some people think it was.

*TL;DR: Harry never had a trust vault. Trust vaults don't exist in canon. The Potters were rich, but not Lestrange/Malfoy levels of rich. Comparing the Potter vault to the Lestrange vault just reinforces how much richer the truly wealthiest families were than Harry. The fact Harry spends so much time with the Weasley family (a poor family) just makes Harry look far wealthier than he actually is.*

*** I agree with you that for most writers its a wank to give Harry lots of wealth and rare artifacts, but I think that an argument could be made for the existence of another vault. Or at least Harry being an unreliable narrator and not noticing other stuff besides money in his one vault that is mentioned.

We see that the Lestrange vault has lots of other stuff in it like armour and exotic animal skins. In addition, it's very much emphasized that despite the poverty that the Gaunts live in they still have their family heirlooms (the ring and the locket). In comparison to that, and given that we know that the Potters are both an old family and a wealthy one, Harry's vault only having coins is kind of odd.

Even if everything James and Lily personally owned was destroyed in Godrics Hollow, why wouldn't he have all of the Potters stuff collected over generations? Not necessarily valuables like gems and rare books and timeturners that fanon likes to give him, but just /things/ that accumulate with a long family history. A great grandmothers wedding dress, or something that would have been put in storage. Candlesticks, quilts, pocketwatches, weapons from wars that they've fought in, paintings, etc. Are we supposed to think that that one invisibility cloak is the only thing that a centuries old family ever passed down?

Besides it would be the parents setting up the trust vault and it would probably cost a bit and that to the goblins would probably be worth it just to keep a vault filled with stuff even if it was inactive.

I agree that billionaires and even millionaires are ridiculous if you take one look at the exchange rate from galleon to pound in first year, wasn't it like 50 pounds to the galleon or something?

I'd gues that it was some secondary vault given for Harry's school years with a generous amount left over possibly for a mastery in a subject or two, but I will refuse to accept that being the main vault of the Potters

** Absolutely nothing in Canon even suggest the possibility of a trust vault, so I'd be more inclined to believe it's his main, and only vault.

As said by other peoples, the idea of a trust vault was a fanon idea created in order to maker Harry richer than Cresus so he could flaunt his wealth in front of Malfoy ("You got your place in the quidditch team by buying top of the line brooms for your team? Let me buy the same brooms for the 3 other teams so you loose your advantage).\\
But judging by canon, you could either consider that the Potters, while being rather wealthy, were not rich (we do know that Fleamont was a pretty succesfull businessman who invented cosmetics potions, but in PoA Harry chose to not buy 1 Firebolt by fear of the dent in would make in his inheritance), or you could consider that he truly is rich, though it brings the question of why he doesn't know about it, which can't really be answered without a whole bunch of "Manipulative Dumbledore".

I would also want to point that, in the Magical World of HP, wealth doesn't have the same power than in the Muggle world, or even the muggle world. The Magical World has an economy of luxury items, since most of rest can be created by magic. For example, between Charms to conserve food, multiply it and ransfiguration to change the taste, one grocery trip could last for years. And what's the point in bying lands when you can just multiply the one your already own?\\
Basically, the Magical World trade clothing, enchanted items (like brooms or sneakoscope), magical ingredients and Goblin Cradted items, and services like the different pubs seen in the serie. Because of this, the cost of living is actually ridicusly low for a wizards, and the "need" of wealth in inferior. So Harry having 15 000 000 000 000 galleons doesn't make any sense, the combined wealth of all the magical world may not reach this sum.

Also, the low cost of live is one of the reason who make me think that Hogwarts may be a "free" school, or have really low cost. After all, the only thing paid by the school would be the salary of the teachers, and maybe the magical ingredients used in potion. And since the students have the bring their own ingredients for class, it means just the potion used in the infirmary. Considering the fact that the school is a true mine of wealth (just the plants growed in Herbology and the Ingredients collected in the forest), the school probably has no problem paying these cost so there is no point into making enormous admission fees (especially since children "need" to learn magic to not break the Statute and the Hogwarts is the only local alternative outside of homeschooling).

*** I'm going to address your points from bottom to top, idk why

I think Hogwarts either is a free school and gets minor donations by magicals or it has a small tuition few, mainly because, there is food problem (come on there must be hundreds of people in the castle, also the house elves need food too. Then the salaries which I believe to be quite substantial or it would be a lot harder to get new DADA teachers every year, like Remus Lupin for example wouldn't have taken the job if it didn't pay decently.---We don't actually know that they collect ingredients from the forest, we only see them going into the forest thrice, 1.the detention with Hagrid first year, 2.going to that acromantula nest and 3. Leading Umbitsh to the forest to look at their ”weapon”. ------Also the infirmary would have to be very well stocked due to the idiots whacking metal balls at each others head while flying like 60 feet off the ground, yes I know that magicals /can/ bounce but still.

Now, wealth can still be very useful in the magical world, I agree that it wont be used similarly as in the muggle world but it can and will most likely be used to buy land and build houses as well as bribing people in politics, as is demonstrated when Arthur Weasley tells Harry that Cornelius Fudge is ”in Malfoys pocket” ---- and how the farsk can you multiply the land you already own?? Same with food, isn't it a law of transfiguration that you cant conjure food if you don't know where there is food, and there is no bloody way a charm will be able to duplicate food, Geminio doesn't work with that, --------- as far as I'm concerned a stasis charm is the only way to conserve food, and even that charms existence is fanon.

Now sadly I wont be giving you any arguments on this one because I whole heartedly agree with all your points but I see a problem in the fact that Harry can access a fortune at eleven, he's very likely a millionaire in pounds with the ridiculous exchange rate that there was from galleons to pounds, so either that vault has a limit, it's a trust vault or his parents are really really irresponsible.

It's funny, I never considered the DADA teacher to be paid more than the other teacher (which is probably not bad considered the requirement of the job but not enough to be rich or anything). All the DADA teacher we see in canon, except maybe Snape are in the school for another reason than teaching : Quirrel was there for the stone, Lockart for the publicity, Lupin as a defence against Sirius, Moody as a favor for Dumbledore (or Crouch Jr to get Harry to the cemetery I guess), Umbridge to take control of the school, Snape as a double spy (though he really wanted the job), and Carrow as a Death Eater.\\
But pay apart, Professor as Hogwarts is a sweet job. You get to live in the access with all its ressources (including the library and the feasts), and you have no other expanse than the eventual outing to the pub.

​

#+begin_quote
  and how the farsk can you multiply the land you already own??
#+end_quote

Though not directy explained in canon, Space Extension charms exist in HP. We can see several examples of them like the Ford Anglia in CoS (which is charmed so there is enough space for 8 people and 6 trunks on the way to the Hogwarts Express), the magical tents seen in GoF and DH, Moody trunk, the Room of Requirement and arguably even Diagon Alley (though it could just be an Implotable location).

​

#+begin_quote
  Same with food, isn't it a law of transfiguration that you cant conjure food if you don't know where there is food

Here's a quote from DH said by Hermione to Ron :" /Food is one of the first of five Principal Exceptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfigur--- ... It's impossible to make good food out of nothing! You can Summon it if you know where it is, you can transform it, you can increase the quantity if you've already got some/ "

You may not be able to "create" food, but you can increase quantity and transform it. I admit that my interpretation that say that "transforming food" include stopping them from going bad (and so the bacon eaten by the heros may come from a pig killed by Gryffindor himself), but even without this, the increase in quantity mean that no matter if you have to feed one person or 1000, the grocery bill won't increase.\\
It's for this reason I consider feeding the castle must not cost much.

​

#+begin_quote
  are really really irresponsible.
#+end_quote

To be fair they were really young (died at 21), in the middle of a civil war since out of school and probably never had the time to deal with it. I mean, fanon loves to talk about a "sealed will" which usually explain the plot (as if people who didn't even trust Dumbledore about the secret keeper would put the whole plot in writing knowing it would ever end up with the Goblin which can totally be bought like in DH, or in an Office of the Ministry which is full of Death Eater and Imperiused people).\\
What probably happened is that the Potter died without any will, and Harry just happened to get everything as the next of kin.

** In the comments you keep referring to the Lestrange vaults as your evidence for the Potters having a second vault. I don't see how this is even acceptable evidence. We aren't ever given the indication that the Lestranges and Potters were on the same level of wealth. And why would James and Lily set up a vault for an infant? Because most wizarding families just seem to give their children an allowance to pay for school supplies, so a trust vault wouldn't make sense. And Harry is a very unreliable narrator and there may be more in his vault than money but maybe he doesn't think to look. Also we aren't told exact amount of money in his vault.
