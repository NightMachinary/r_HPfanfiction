I mean. HP fanfiction readers most likely know what I'm talking about with "Gringotts Fix-It" and it's practically a staple in the fandom so it would be nice to have a search tag for them.

‚Äã

To define:

Gringotts Fix-It

A Harry Potter fanwork trope where a character, usually Harry Potter, goes to Gringotts and through the power of paperwork and magic fixes plot issues, and/or gains certain resources (i.e. information, money, properties, magical abilities, contracts etc.)

‚Äã

But that's just my humble appeal to HP fanfiction writers out there. :D

****** People use Gringotts owls being blocked to turn it into yet another crime for Dumbledore, which is fine if that's what you want to do. I'm just saying that there are other contexts, which work just as well, where it isn't a bad idea.

And placing Harry with the Dursleys, for all that they're horrible, actually makes sense if you think about it. There would have been a custody war over Harry if he'd stayed in the magical world, a custody war which I think the more malevolent families would have stood excellent odds of winning. Consider the facts that they have access not only to extensive funds for bribes and lawyers (not that we ever see a magical lawyer in canon), but also violent people who would be only too happy to attack families like the Tonkses or Weasleys just for shits and giggles, let alone with the idea of aiding the custody position of a family like the Malfoys.

******** To piggyback on some of the other comments, I've spent the last two years working for an estate lawyer and let me tell you, people fuck up their wills ALL THE TIME. I can't tell you how many tragic situations we had to deal with because someone died without any documents even though they knew they were sick, or someone thought that handwritten scribbles on a document were sufficient changes, or did a will with no witnesses or notary or with conflicted witnesses, or who forgot to update their documents after birth of a child or death of a beneficiary or named successor - people who had ample warning that they needed to get their shit together and still, for whatever reason, didn't. It's well within the realm of possibility that two people in their early twenties, who've just had a baby and are fighting in a guerilla war, either wrote their documents wrong or just didn't do them at all. Lily canonically comes from a background that is, at best, upper middle class, and James's parents died before he was out of school, so it is very likely that neither of them had the opportunity to learn the importance of estate planning or how to do the legal parts correctly - it happens all the time.

Would the Potters, all of 21 years old, have thought to draw any wills up? Or would they, like all young people, have considered the idea that they might die supremely unlikely?

Would any of the people likely to be listed in the will as being preferred carers for Harry still be available after the events around Halloween '81?

I will not contest, however, that if there /were/ any wills, the fact that they never surfaced was 100% a crime and that they should have been read and their instructions put into action.

However, I think you're probably correct that anyone they would have named would have been unavailable. The only people we can be absolutely sure of that they were close enough to trust raising Harry with are the Marauders. Sirius and Peter were both obviously out and presumably Remus would be disqualified by his werewolf status.

How? The war just ended. Most of them were either in prison or just had to spent alot of political capital and bribes using the imperious defence to avoid going to Azkaban. Karkaroff was singing names and public morale was at all time high as there was widespread hunt on dark wizards.

If the dark wizards could still win at their lowest point then this is basically a "entire magical world gets bashed" type of story.

******** Tbh I think the entire magical community of Britain deserves some bashing, considering so many of them were some shade of pureblood supremacist, ranging in shade from 'oh, how clever the muggles are to come up with ways to live without magic (treating muggles like particularly clever or entertaining trained apes)' to 'every person that isn't at least an 8th generation magical human is scum unfit to lick my boots (and fuck anything that isn't human)'. The only people who I don't think get tarred by this brush are the muggleborn and very recent halfbloods, and they were the ones getting hunted down by Voldemort and his Death Eaters so they either fled the country or died. For realsies; the only named muggleborn characters who lived during the first civil war are dead by the start of canon.

I also think that there were enough people in positions of power who were sympathetic to the Death Eater cause, without actually being members, that the bribe money and political capitol required to get the caught Death Eaters out of trouble was somewhat less than you expect. Remember that people wanted things to get back to normal as quickly as possible, which is the given reason for Sirius' incarceration having been rushed through with almost no official proceedings. I think a lot of people /wanted/ to believe the Imperius Curse defence, because it let them return to the comfortable and familiar, let them believe that some of the richest (I don't want to say most respected, because I don't respect them) families weren't such monsters after all.

One night, shortly before his seventeenth birthday, Fawkes appears in his room, and whisks him away to a hidden stronghold. There, our hero meets the spirit of Godric Gryffindor, who takes Harry as his apprentice. Harry/Multi. Powerful, not godlike. Intelligent Harry. Ch 2 is NOT missing.

***** Shopping trips should be shown if worldbuilding is improved by it (it can be a good place to show off some new aspects of the WW, or how it's different from the canon version), if there are important plot elements that are appropriate there, or if there's character interactions.

Otherwise, a few short paragraphs like you mention are the way to go.

** I actually don't really like this trope at all, Gringott's Bank in the books and the movies is more like vault keeping- we never see that they had other functions like banks in the modern world have; interest and other financial services. You just go in there to get your money, all the goblins do is store your money and safeguard it.

For all intents and purpose a wizard could just bury their gold in their backyard and end up with the same thing, of course it wouldn't be secure unless they had it inside a warded area or something but it's the same thing.

So when a fiction relies heavily on this basically and uses the trope that the bank will fix all the Harry's problems, unlock hidden powers, provide legal services, other financial services, buy clothes for him buy houses or build them, buy furniture for him...

It's basically a variation of the shopping spree trope except instead of Harry doing it the goblins do all the work and you just get updates on the end result. I feel like this is pretty lazy writing because for all the work that goes into explaining the goblins actually doing this Harry just has to say a few things and boom now he's the great magical Lord of so and so with 50 properties, bank accounts all over the world, financial investments in companies bought and built in the Muggle world and manage by the goblins, they build his Mansion fortress Castle and Ward it to high heaven, using a blood test they unlock all the Lost or closed vaults, find marriage contracts, heal him of all physically or magical bindings or curses and grant him powers never before seen.

And at that point I always wonder, hell why aren't the goblins in this universe ruling the entire world yet? Oh that's right even though they can basically do whatever they want and can do magic that no wizard could even come close to and basically control the financial world like they're the Illuminati because they lost one war to the wizards or an uprising they're now just "simple bankers."

Suuuure.

*** Most people don't like the trope - but in my opinion it's mostly because it's done badly.

From a worldbuilding perspective, it seems pretty clear to me that there has to be more to Gringott's than just the vault - Harry just doesn't care about any other parts of it. The Goblins have a fairly large amount of power, including 'rebelling' (or war-ring, I don't think we can conclusively say which) vs the wizards a few times and presumably coming to a stalemate. The way in which that extended aspect of Gringotts can go can vary - but I think a lot of people gravitate towards "goblins want to make money, so they studied muggle banks and use their techniques".

We also know that goblins likely offer at least some other financial services - Ludo Bagman borrowed a lot of money from Goblins. So lending is a thing, either by individual goblins or by Gringotts or both. They also offer money exchange - british muggle money to wizarding money (this is another point that people use to infer that they operate with the muggle world, though I've also seen fics where that's a deal with the Ministry. IIRC JKR said in an interview that the Goblins make a profit off of fencing it to the Muggles, but it was a while ago that I looked it up). If they control the minting of new coins, that also would give them a lot of monetary power over Wizarding Britain. If we take those points, it's not too far a jump to become a fully fledged modern bank - even if wizards don't use it that way.

Personally, I don't mind the basic premise of it (ie, the 'Gringotts is a real bank and does bank things to make money'), nor the (admittedly trite) approach of Harry being more respectful to them and getting friendlier with the goblins. That shouldn't make them fall head over heels in love with him by any means, but I do like the potential of exploring a different culture than the WW and one of a people that's more demonized in the books. But the power fantasy is where it loses me.

**** Ill agree with you on those, use smartly it's a small aspect that Harry can use intelligently as a resource.

On the other hand I'm a Tolkien fan as well, and also dnd, and had somewhat biased my head canon on my view of goblins based of them. Fica that lean more in that direction just interest me more, whether as a significant plot device or just as background world building.

I see goblins as humanoid, but inherently alien in nature. They live underground, and based of thier physiology, with long pointed ears, sharp needle like teeth, claws, and little beady eyes they resemble vermin more than anything.

Goblins in canon are known best for thier weapons, goblin weapons and e prizes for thier durability, and thier ability to take in what would damage them and become stronger (not sure if that's just Gryffindors sword though). The second thing they are known for is thier bank, mostly located underground, a vast maze of tunnels and vaults.

We don't know much about thier canon society or culture, just that there have been multiple goblin rebellions in the past, pointing to thier agresive and war like nature. We also know how they treat thier creations, as goblin craft, once bought only belongs to the items owner for the duration of thier lifetime. Thier views on possession and ownership differ from humans.

We also can assume that during the last war, up until voldemorts defeat, they had never been stated to have joined his or any side, and their bank is touted as being unbreakable, no one who breaks in comes out (this is later proven more as a status symbol and reputation than actual fact, as Quirllmort and latter harry potter both break in and out.)

Put all these facts together, some extrapolation, add a dash of deepcut fantasy elements, and actual cultural lore and myths form all of europe and we can create Goblins‚Ñ¢.

Vile, hateful beings that live in burroughs, they were master smiths and artificers by necessity, deep underground they first carved out by hand, then using tools that became better each generation, when they learned to forge and discovered the magic of the earth they began building minging contraptions, unbreakable tools and weapons, large underground cities.

Then they somehow came in contact with wizards and at some point thier diametrically different cultures came into opposition, and would erupt in conflict. Goblins had things wizards old would desire, precious metals, jewels, unbreakable tools and weapons. Wizards had things goblins desired, externally welded precision magic that could be cast, and was near infinetly flexible.

At some point Gryffindors sword was either commissioned, won, or taken as a prize, and after multiple conflicts we know wizard magic was just more versatile than what goblins had available, eventually they were routed back underground and had thier burroughs sealed and thier people somehow contained. Of course this peace would not last. The goblins "rebellions" were the measures wizards took somehow failing, and goblins trying once more to defeat them. Eventually after many significant losses on both sides, although wizards triumphed again and again they grew tired and somehow bound goblin kind. By spell, enchantment, or curse or vow or even trick, goblins had to live in certain locations, could not mingle with wizard kind, and would cease conflict. Goblins not seeing an out agreed, on the promise of allowing wizards to store and safeguard thier possession, and to give wizards access to thier riches. This "treaty" would stand, goblins minting and creating the modern wizarding currency, and many magical items and jewelery forged and sold by goblins to wizards, most which ended up again in vaults.

The goblins retreted to thier major burrough, on which Gringott's now resided, and in the end won more that wizards thought. For most of the wizards riches would often return to goblin hands, eventually, as families and people died out, and vaults were left closed and forgotten. By goblin culture and right the could eventually reclaim goblin forged goods as well. They manage the wizarding world modern economy, and we know he who holds money holds power.

But they don't treat bit like we do, they hoard it, covet it, goblins fight to the death to "manage" wizard account and oversee vaults like humans work to earn wages to get a bigger home and more useless items as a show of status, goblin hierarchy is decided by thier hoard.

They least favored and unlucky goblins, or the young ones have to work above ground and interact with disgusting wizards, hence thier often disagreeable and nasty disposition. Those that lose everything or have been cought commiting crimes based on their laws are sent to the lowest pits to attend dragons, they feed them, clean them, sometimes are eaten, and cart thier labour alongside other imprisoned humans that were caught trying to break in.

On the surface in Gringott's goblins have adapted thier waring nature, since they cannot attack wizards or humans, they resort to mental games, iron bound loans and contracts with loopholes that work onbthier favor if the humans violate them. They are willing to outsource, working with human curse breakers to raid magical tombs, working with the magical ministries to provide some legal perview in assocation with material matters like ownership of items and properties. They loan money and act as loan sharks, they work bets, black markets, and can do exchanges. they use contracted wizards and squibs to infiltrate, and work in human finance, using magic when possible to stack the deck in thier favor. Wall street, stocks, betting, property ownership, metals trading, mining. Anything that will get them access to money, precious metals, material resources.

This is how harry could interact with them, possibly learning some of thier behind the scenes interactions, leaning to play thier game and beating them at it, or playing them and saying look, if I win, you win, it's in our best interest to help each other.

I could go on but ill leave anyone that read through this entire thing to find inspiration.
