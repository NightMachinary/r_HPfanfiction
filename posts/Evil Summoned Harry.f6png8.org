I am looking for a fic in which the Order/Dumbledore etc summon a Harry Potter but instead of fighting for them he fights against and goes on full Dark Lord


** linkffn(10685852),

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13983162/chapters/32195046#workskin]])

and I know of a third one that I can't seem to find right now. It has a Harry that has been summoned once before already.. They are all sadly not yet finished :(

  AU. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. MoD!Harry, Godlike!Harry, Unhinged!Harry. Dumbledore bashing.

**** "James Charlus Potter may have been my father in another dimension, but I will not be ordered about like a small child. And if you ever insult Severus in my presence again I'll reap your soul where you stand"

Got about this far, don't really know why I bothered to read it after the first few paragraphs. I suppose being absolutely pathetically edgy isn't quite the same as evil. Though following through and murdering someone for a literal insult alone would be both absolutely evil, not to mention the most child-like tantrum that's possible to throw.

** Not quite a 'evil' Harry, but this one does have him getting pissed at Dumbledor, and doing things his own way. linkffn(11160991)

Also Divination teacher Harry, which is just funny. Sadly its abandoned but I still enjoyed the read nonetheless.

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP
