I don't know if this fanfic already exists, but imagine...

In the seventh book, Hogwarts is taken over by the Death Eaters, with Snape as the headmaster. Voldemort has applied for the job of DADA teacher before, even though he had nefarious reasons. What if, sometime during that year, when he wasn't actively out there doing Dark Lord stuff or looking for the Elder Wand, on a total whim, he decides to drop by at Hogwarts, and takes over the DADA class for a few days.

Imagine him breaking the news to a stunned Snape, and students' surprise to see him in the classroom. Would he teach anything? Could he be worse than Umbridge? Would Amycus Carrow be used as a teaching assistant? Since Hogwarts is the only place he's ever felt like home, and since nobody can do anything about it, what if he inserts himself even further into the daily lives of the school? I can see this idea being fun because Voldemort would literally be the only person enjoying himself in the whole castle, everyone else would be terrified and miserable, including the Death Eaters.


** Love this idea! Write it.

-he gets rid of the concept of "years" altogether and just divides students up by intelligence, ability, and usefulness

-the other professors can no longer teach properly because there is just constant screaming and daily explosions from the DADA classroom as students fight each other in practical lessons

-replaces practical exams with boot camp-like obstacle courses

-students slowly stop showing up to the Great Hall for meals because he's always there, pontificating and announcing some random new torture they'll have to endure

It's almost the exact opposite of my fic, in which he gets the DADA position very early, is only reluctantly involved in the affairs of the school, and the only person that seems to be miserable is him.

*** Anywhere I can read yours? Do you mean he gets the job when he applied the first few times?

I dunno if I want him to make such drastic changes, because he's not gonna stay, and he won't want to worry about the campus management part of the job. I think he likes Hogwarts more or less the way it is, it's the version that connects with him, although he'd get rid of Housing if he gets the chance.

I'm kinda thinking he doesn't go about his way doing killings and tortures, although those do happen. He's not trying to make others miserable, not more than usual, but his sheer presence achieves that effect.

**** Ah yeah that makes sense. More of a temporary thing.

Yes, my fic takes place about five years after he graduated and applied the first time.

What?

** Methods of Rationality has him more fully possessing Quirrell, and embracing the opportunity to teach Battle Magic, with full-scale mock battles between student armies, teaching real tactics and strategy.

#+begin_quote
  "Dueling?" said the Defense Professor. From behind it wasn't visible if the pale face was smiling. "That is nothing, Lord Greengrass, to what my students have learned. They have learned not to hesitate in the face of ambushes and greater foes. They have learned to adapt when combat conditions change and change again. They have learned to protect their allies, to protect more those who are more valuable, to abandon pieces which cannot be rescued. They have learned that to survive they must follow orders. Some have even learned a little creativity. Oh, no, Lord Greengrass, /these/ wizards will not hide in their manors and wait to be protected, when the next threat comes. They will know that they know how to fight."

*** I keep forgetting that Voldemort actually "taught" at Hogwarts for a year. Hearing Quirrell stuttering base-level magical knowledge to a bunch of sneering kids for a YEAR! Getting his face smashed by snowballs conjured by Fred and George. That must have a hell of a year for him to endure. Maybe we should've given him the Philosopher's Stone, I say the guy earned it.

***** I agree, Voldemort was so weak at that time, even coming out of the turban to speak to Harry had Quirrell worrying "you are not strong enough, master". That was just talking! I wouldn't be surprised if Voldemort was actually dormant most of the time, only waking up at critical times or regularly for updates.

** Forget how he teaches. Voldemort just did a big nono... He took the DADA job without getting rid of the curse...

"/THE DARK LORD ACCEPTS DADA POSITION AT HOGWARTS/ wait, what?" Harry dropped a week-old copy of the Daily Prophet in shock.\\
"Ouch!" Hermione accidentally poked her hand too far into the campfire when adding more wood.\\
"Bugger!" Ron forgot to duck when exiting the tent and clotheslined himself. "What are we going to do about this?" He asked from the ground.\\
"We have to do something!" Hermione almost pleaded.

Harry, collapsed to the ground. And started laughing. Concerned, his friends tried to see what was wrong. And every time he would stop and open his mouth, he would start uncontrollably laughing again. Eventually, Harry calmed down enough to talk.\\
"He's the DADA professor. Remember the curse? I'm willing to bet even /he/ forgot about it. We'll just have to wait and he'll take care of himself. You know, he most likely outsmarted himself and signed a magical contract for /multiple/ years with no escape clauses to really cement his position. Yeah, we'll ju- hnnng!" Harry gasped and curled into himself. And tried to laugh some more, but that is hard when under the mental strain of trying to fight Voldemort out of his mind... "This is priceless! That's exactly what happened! Riddle just confirmed it for me! Let's go on vacation guys!"

One year, two days, and three hours later- Voldemort faded from existence. Since he knew about the curse and willingly signed up to an unescapable multi-year contract- the horcruxes Suicide Clause kicked in and he died.

** Would... would-......

There's canonically a curse of some description on the DADA position. I'm not sure if it's simply implied, or canon, or fanon, but my recollection says a pre-Voldemort Riddle cursed the position.

Given how many years pass, and the whole dying and resurrecting thing.

Would Voldemort inadvertently vanquish himself by teaching DADA?

*** Voldemort cursing the DADA post is all but confirmed fact, Dumbledore seems to believe it to be so, and that's usually evidence enough. However the curse doesn't necessarily kill you, it only means the teacher would have to leave the post for one reason or another, and may have misfortune in the end. We know Lockhart and Umbridge at least never died, although both suffered in other ways. In my hypothesis, I don't intend for Voldemort to stay on the post anyway, it was a temp thing, to give him a taste of what might've been, so the curse shouldn't affect him, he was leaving anyway. Plus, I think he can easily exclude himself from his own curse, if it comes to that.
