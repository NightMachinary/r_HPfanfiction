The books: obviously all 100% canon, although there are some points that are a bit wonky or shaky in the books they can work with a bit of analysis or theories.

The movies: for me, that's a no because I've never liked them, even if I didn't manage to watch all of them completely. Something about them doesn't line up with the books. Ron and Ginny being character assassinated is one huge one. Any interactions not in the book will basically be canon, so I avoid the movies completely.

Interviews: the interviews of the earlier days of the fandom, like Neville is blonde and Sirius has grey eyes. Dumbledore is gay, Lily is very popular at school, Harry's parents are unemployed and live on a fortune that James has inherited, etc.

Pottermore: so far, some of that? Although that won't work when you only handpick a few stuff from the website that fits your headcanons. Maybe stuff only written by Rowling? It might be an unpopular opinion but I much much prefer Fleamont and Euphemia over Charlus and Dorea. Some of the stuff in there is neat, however but I'm not a fan of things such as the method to become an animagus, I expected much more transfiguration. I'm on the fence on that one.

Tweets: nope.

The Fantastic Beasts Franchise: so far, I like some of the things in there and even if I don't consider the series canon by the time it's ended, Newt Scamander will forever be an endearing oddball expelled from Hogwarts for me. Leta Lestrange is also too good to not be real. Some of the stuff in there is pretty meh though. When is McGonagall even born by now? Either 1935 or way way way back. Depp Grindelwald is also a bit underwhelming?


** Hmm. My gut reaction is to say the books and anything said or written by JKR up to the release of Deathly Hallows. So, the side books, her old website, those hype interviews, etc. Movies, tweets, pottermore I tend to not see as canon.

The new movies are a little tricky, though. I kinda just want to pick and choose based on what I do and don't like, but that seems a little wrong. If I had to draw a hard-and-fast line, I'd say that the characters are part of canon but the plot is not. The new world building is tricky -- I wasn't exactly a fan of Magical America, but the bit in [[/u/4ecks]] post about Underbeings I think could be pretty evocative.

But in all I think it's a bit of a thorny exercise!

** The parts that I consider canon or like to draw from are...

1) The books. This should go without saying

2) Early interviews. Like you, I consider these canon, though I'm not above disregarding them if it helps one of my stories.

3) The video games. I know that these are probably the least accurate depiction of canon, but I honestly really enjoy drawing some of the smaller details from them, like the names of spells or what year certain spells are taught.

4) Very minimally, Pottermore. I pretty much only use this as a source for character names and disregard everything else.

*** The dates on the Black family tree say that Cygnus Black (dad to Bella, Narcissa, and Andromeda) had them at age 13. I find it useful as a name/bloodline reference, but the numbers are illogical, tbh.

I've seen people in the main sub defend the date as "people married young in the old days", but Cygnus was born in the 1900's, hardly medieval times, with access to magical medicine. Wizards live so long that the notion of needing to marry young and make an "heir and a spare" wouldn't make sense in their society.

Bellatrix and her husband didn't seem to have been pushed into having babies young for the pureblood agenda, since she was arrested and childless at age 30.

Everything else is taken with a grain of salt. Pottermore tends to contradict the books and her tweets make no sense. Oh and I ignore pretty much all interviews post-OotP.

Practically speaking, that would be the events of the books and some tweets (like Dumbledore being gay).

Everything else is non-canon and can freely be changed since most people wouldn't notice, by definition.

For example, James' parents' names are both Fleamont and Euphemia /and/ Charlus and Dorea at the same time. Until you see it in the story, both are true. Once the story states one of them to be true, the other becomes untrue.

Does that make sense?

** Imo only the books are canon. Death of the author & all that; if you accept JKR's continuous words on the series, she could (and probably has) give an interview or write an article with information that completely changes or negates aspects of the books and you literally would have to accept that as canon. Picking and choosing what counts from within a given medium (e.g. interviews) feels too nebulous to me. But I find it perfectly acceptable to draw on the movies, Pottermore etc for inspiration and also deeply do not care how canon-compliant a fic is beyond characters being generally in-character, so maybe that's why I find it easier to think this way.

***** "Underbeing" is some kind of urban fantasy-tier terminology which places magical creatures and those with creature blood below the proper human wizards.

I dislike it because it doesn't fit well with the original books. It's not a clear ret-con, but tonally it doesn't mesh with the magical culture as established in book canon. Fleur was praised and admired for her beauty, grace, and abilities. Madame Maxime was the Headmistress of the Western European magical school. Flitwick was an accomplished wizard, a pro dueling champion, and not even Draco's gang said anything about him when they went after Hagrid for being part-giant.

From what we saw in the books, Hagrid was persecuted more for being clumsy, poorly-spoken, and uneducated, because he only had 3 years of school before his wand was broken, than for his giant's blood.

I would consider the first 5 books hard canon, everything else is in my mind a softer canon that you can play with as you wish. That is one of the things I like about fanfic, canon is what you need it to be. And there is such a large pool to draw from! Want to make a crack fic based on one of her tweets? go ahead. A line from one of the movies is the start of your canon divergence fic? awesome! Need to discard book 6 to make your fic work? Fair enough.

It's by the same measure that I am not too fussed about ships... I have one I love, (Guess which one...) but the only times I try to get into anything with anyone else are when they put my ship down.

** I actually thought about this last week. I think that my rule of thumb is "any book, e-book or article written by Rowling is canon, anything else is subject to interpretation."

So, the books are the default canon, but the auxillary books and the Pottermore articles specifically written by her are equally canon. Yes, even the part about wizarding America that had people so much up in arms. This isn't to say that the books and articles tell the WHOLE story... to paraphrase Douglas Adams, while I do consider the texts written by JKR as the truth and nothing but the truth, I don't necessarily consider them to be the whole truth. (Though any speculation on what the whole truth might be veers into headcanon and fanon... maybe it makes sense or is even plausible, but it's not actual canon.)

When it comes to the "subject to interpretation" part, I use the term "broad strokes canon" to refer to things like tweets, interviews and Q&A answers by JKR. Sometimes she writes/says these things on the fly and ends up contradicting herself or forgetting the actual story, so if the answers don't quite make sense with the books or articles, or contradict each other, then I defer to the books or articles. However, if it does make sense or doesn't contradict anything, I consider it canon. JKR Tweets that Anthony Goldstein is Jewish? Okay, it's canon that Anthony Goldstein is Jewish. (I don't consider this actual representation, mind you, but I still count it as canon.)

Adaptations or spin-offs, like the movies or videogames or Cursed Child, that were approved but not written by JKR, are not canon... Though, if they cover material that isn't mentioned in the books, I consider that material to be "broad strokes canon." Like, characters introduced in videogames and movies, like Nigel Wolpert from the movies, Fay Dunbar from the HBP videogame, Ben Copper from Hogwarts Mystery and Mathilda Grimblehawk from Cases from the Wizarding world, I accept as canon characters who EXIST in the world of the books... even if the events of the stories they're in might not have happened, or at least not happened in that exact way, in canon.

Both Cursed Child AND the Fantastic Beasts movies seem to take more cues from the movies than from the books... so I consider them as a whole to be "broad strokes canon." In my mind, the events of those stories happened in SOME form, but not necessarily in the exact way they're presented on stage/screen/script. Like the play and the movies are retellings "inspired by" what really happened, and not a wholly accurate representation of the actual canon events.

** I tend to use a hierarchy to determine what is and isn't canon. You consult each layer starting at the top, and move down if it's not covered.

The books are the ultimate source of canon. JKR wrote them, and they got edited and revised multiple times. If it contradicts the books, it's not canon. Even if JKR delivers an ultimatum that something is canon, if it contradicts the books, it's a no-go. If she wants to change something, she can get ut edited and update the books.

Next we have additional sources coming from JKR. This can be interviews, tweets, her writings on Pottermore, her companion novels, etc. JKR is the primary source for Potter lore, what she says goes, so long as it doesn't contradict the books.

Next we enter more the more dubious territory of the movies, the Fantastic Beasts franchise, the Cursed Child, and Harry Potter at Universal Studios. Again, the key is that nothing from this level can contradict the higher levels. Also, much of the content of these sources was fabricated to fit what was possible/available, etc. Personally, I don't mind using them to substitute in facts and details that were missing from the books and JKR's other writings. The key is to remember that they are not set in stone.

Maybe I'm overthinking this...

** My view of canon is a blend of books, movies and anecdotes I've heard elsewhere that I presumed was from JKR (which may or may not actually be correct, I don't go out of my way to verify everything as long as I consider it plausible enough).

But I never had a very strict sense of canon. As long as fics don't stray too far away from what I consider canon (in its overall setting that is -- obviously, few fics are strictly canon compilant), I'm not really bothered. A Time Turner throwing someone back in time several years and the the universe diverging from the original pre-Turn timeline as a result? Fine by me, even if, to me, that's not something that can happen in canon.

** Books, of course.

Movies for things that I like.

Stuff that came directly from Rowling as long as it's not too ridiculous.

Anything from Cursed Child is dumb and to be ignored. Anything from the Fantastic Beasts movies are interesting but mostly irrelevant.

** I personally mix and match from the movies, and what is 'canon' is fluid in the first place, IMO. As to anything said after the release of Deathly Hallows, there might be some I could treat as canon. But, far and wide, most of Rowling's 'new canon' seems to be stuff she makes up to keep herself relevant, and half the time she's contradicting something she herself said and/or wrote in the books. The fact she started releasing more of this info after her 'adult writing career' failed to take off in the same fashion as the Potter series obviously has nothing to do with that... (sarcasm)

Myself? I refuse to acknowledge people with the ridiculous names of Fleamont and Euphemia as James' parents and Harry's grandparents, esp. since Rowling waited years to speak on the topic despite fervent speculation that the reason Sirius was so welcomed at the Potters was because Mrs. Potter was in reality Dorea Potter nee Black. The only times I even bother with this particular one is when I decide to have a Harry who's gone back in time to, say, raise his younger self pretend to be Charlus and Dorea's son and thus give him a legitimate reason to have a superior claim to the Potter and Black estates over his younger self and/or Sirius Black.

As to the films? I personally assume that at some point Grindelwald is going to disarm Tina Goldstein, seeing as she disarmed him at the end of the first film. The books and previous films had already proven it doesn't take an official disarming charm or killing the previous owner to transfer mastery of the Elder Wand to another, so technically Tina is the master of the Elder Wand. I've always thought Phoenixes were more likely creatures of balance rather than creatures of the Light, so I don't feel to bothered by the fact that Fawkes, presuming that is him at the end of the second Beasts film, came to Aurelius Dumbledore first (and I'll leave the commentary of adding /another/ Dumbledore sibling to the mix for another time) before supposedly joining Albus at some point. I also accept the bit in Sorcerer's Stone where Voldemort tries to tempt Harry as canon since I firmly believe VOldemort should've been far more cunning than he appeared to be.

TL;DR: I pick and choose what I like and ignore everything else that Rowling puts out to stay relevant.

** Books are Canon the Main 7 Anyway

Everything else isn't Canon, and I don't consider it as such the only other thing I would Consider is the clearing up what Dumbledore and Grindewald's relationship was... That's basically it nothing else. Everything else is extra canonical or assended Fanon

** The books of course, some of the movies stuff (only because it comes up frequently and can be useful when you need to draw a characterization that was more movie than books canon for story reasons without having to give justification ), and I'll throw in the magical creatures from Fantastic Beasts but absolutely nothing else.

Mine was deep enough to make a horcrux. xD

** I generally hold the settings explained in the books to be Canon up until book 5, like many others do. I also hold the earlier tweets, Dumbledore being gay, to be Canon. In my personal head-canon, Charlus and Dorea Potter are the grandparents of James and that James' parents died young. They themselves died shortly during the 1st Voldemort war.
