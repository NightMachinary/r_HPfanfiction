#+TITLE: What do you guys think would be a good magical equivalent of an Air Force? Broom regiments? Something entirely different perhaps? Would it change from the 1940s to the 1980s at all?

** There can't be any good replacement for air force in the magical world. Please read some history to see how air force was created and what it does in combat and think a bit:

1. A wizard on a broom can't attack from further away than one on land (spells don't fall like bombs do)
2. A wizard on a broom is much more predictable (for the next 2 secs of movement) than one on land.
3. Any wizard on land can have a broom and take to the skies so you risk being intercepted by any "land" unit.
4. As fun to imagine broom combat between 2 forces sounds, the danger is very high: any stunning/incapacitating spell is a death spell so most rational fighters will try to land and fight from a much safer position

You can do some recon (fly high and look around), you can do a bit of surprise attack (humans are not hardcoded to look up for the enemies), but after the initial attack landing fast and fighting from the ground is better (unless you carry some kind of bombs - not wizard like!)

Also, please notice that the magical "wars" in the HP books are not really wars, more like guerilla combat, so all the fighters are kind of multirole.

*** Yeah, I was thinking magical broom dogfights sound very cool but wouldn't be realistic, unless there is something other than brooms.

But magical bombers, why not? Dropping some volatile or explosive potions, enchanted/cursed objects or something.

**** OP pretty much has the right of it, though. Typically, flying through the air is a response to front lines: You sneak into enemy territory and do some damage behind the lines. Plus, there is the issue of moving quickly, without infrastructure.

But front lines are a response to restricted movement, and unless you introduce fanon elements like apparition bans on a whole country, the movement of wizards is never restricted, /and/ it's instantaneous. They can apparate and attack wherever they like. And as magical structures aren't more vulnerable from the air than from any other angle, there's also not much point in dropping something on them.

What's left is the original purpose of aeriel warfare: Observation. I suppose in the rare case where you have a lot of wizards fighting together, it might help if one wizard was up on a broom, but we don't see any such large scale battles. Even the Hogwarts battle was fairly small. There just aren't enough wizards to create a huge army that needs directing.

**** How much can you carry when flying a broom? Also, what's your accuracy when dropping potions from a broom in flight (read on how the bomber crews where trying to hit their target, lot of instruments and they still had an awful precision)? - That guy does more damage fighting normally on the ground, for the most part.

You are much better served using a muggle plane...

Also, I'm not saying you can't put some wizards on brooms for a specific task during a war. But a broom regiment, specially trained for that does not make sense... train those guys as normal combat troops and they will be more effective.

** Wars in the magical world aren't like what you see in real life, they're more like guerilla warfare and the cold war with spies and shit
