** Sorry if I'm not supposed to do a bit of self-promotion not trying to but I wrote two stories with that exact promise the first has harry being raised by Lillys older brother his Nazi hunting wizard uncle Bruno.

​

And the second has harry being raised by petunia until he is in second year and then he's a great uncle takes over custody, Great uncle Philip face down the Nazis he's quite familiar with magic even though he thinks it's a bit a natural. He still values family over anything magic regardless, And he may or may not Shoot someone in the ass with rubber bullets.
