  New Mexico was not the first time Thor had been a mortal. It was only a refinement of the technique. What if James Potter had been Thor, incarnated as a memoryless newborn? On his death, Odin removed his memories as James, due to grief. In Harry's Third Year, a (mostly) reformed Loki restores them. Harry now has a father, a family and a heritage that is going to change the world.

***** No pairing at all. And voldemort is powered up to match harry, otherwise the story would suck.

****** Yup.

Even in the sequel, which is only a few chapters in, there are at best hints at at most two possible pairings. Although one of them has the most adorable scenes.

I can say that whatever it will be, it is explicitly HP/female love interest, if that is what you are asking.

******* I'd like it to be a triad relationship since harry's friendships come in three in this story.

***** I don't think it is. I downloaded it a while ago and got too about 80% on my kindle and a pairing never even came up.

I don't know who it is with but i'm 99% sure that it's not slash but even it it is it won't play a big role.
