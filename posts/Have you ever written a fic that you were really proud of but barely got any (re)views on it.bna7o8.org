** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13217021/1/Tales-From-Durmstrang-Poisoned-Bloodlines]]

”Tales From Durmstrang: Poisoned Bloodlines” is a standalone Potter fic I'm writing that takes a look at the Nordic Wizarding society. It gives an in -depth look at Durmstrang and shows the ways it works but most importantly the ways it doesn't. The characters are extremely flawed people and their actions rarely has a good outcome.

** Well, in terms of comparisons between AO3, where I've received amazing feedback even though I'm a fairly minor writer in the scheme of things, and FFN, where I'm almost a nonentity, the biggest discrepancy shows up in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10370211/1/Elegy-for-a-Goat][Elegy for a Goat]].

That's not really a surprise - it's a slash pairing on FFN, it's Aberforth/Snape, a weird rarepair, and it's a character study that stays within canon's outlines. On AO3, it made a respectable showing; on FFN, it sank like a stone.

Why do I like it? For the Aberforth voice, some of the imagery, and the complexity of the relationships - which include Albus, although he's an offstage presence. But I absolutely understand why it's not most readers' cup of fic.

But, I'm proud of the progress itself; the incremental improvements I believe (hope) I've made so far, as well as having written almost a hundred thousand words. I've gained considerable respect for everyone who's written a full story. This hobby takes more than it gives, at least in my case.

** I have written an one shot that is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12925628/1/Interview-with-Director-Potter][an interview of Harry for the occasion of Battle's 20th anniversary]], linkffn(12925628). I tried to keep it fully canon compliant, but I also see lots of freedom in developing postwar events. For example, I imagined them expanding DA into something much bigger (JKR is the initial of the interviewer, not JK Rowling):

#+begin_quote
  HJP: Another major policy or initiative is our DA Volunteer Network. It started back during that Year, when Hogwarts was under Death Eater occupation and DA members started helping each other beyond defense training. During the year after the War, Hogwarts students continued to help and support each other under Hermione, Ginny, and Luna's leadership. It was Luna who then proposed to formally create a self-help, self-support organization, and the DA Volunteer Network was born. I believe you are part of the Network too?

  JKR: Yes, and my life has improved so much more since I joined it, and I made so many new friends. The Knowledge Repository has been particularly helpful in finding all kinds of useful information and spells. And it comes so handy with the MirrorPhone. That's just an utterly brilliant idea! How did Minister Granger come up with something like that?

  HJP: Actually, the concept came from a Muggle invention called the Internet. The Muggles have millions, no, billions of computers connected together in order to share information and knowledge. They are all indexed and can be searched. Hermione had complained for a long time that Hogwarts Library missed a catalog, an index system. So during her last year at Hogwarts, she began this project with Professor Flitwick and a few other students. The idea of using advanced Protean Charm to communicate with the Repository came later. It took her several years to get it right. At first, members were writing commands on parchments, now it's all MirrorPhone. But I personally prefer parchments.

** two little comedy stories. One of the twins pranking the teachers on Valentines Day.

And another one is a small parody of the magical girl transformation in animies played straight at the battle of Hogwarts.

  Some days, shinobi wanted normality. They wanted an easy love. But there's nothing easy when it comes to Sasuke and Sakura. He doesn't know how to express his feelings, and she knows that to be present is the most precious gift. Though, could he come up with something even better? One-shot. #sasusakufest2017 #dayone #valentinesday

*** Tags matter. Of course, the more obscure/unknown your pairing is, the less people who will be interested in reading it. Consistent updating is important if you don't want to lose followers, and asking readers for feedback or to spread the story usually helps (a bit).

​

And don't be afraid to spread it around on fanfiction forums (like this one) and scream out how awesome you think your story is. Trying to be humble and saying it's okay-ish never got anyone published before.

**** Thanks for answering. I'm writing a HP fic with three extremely flawed and plucky, Scandinavian and Finnish OC:s in the center. It has no ships and does not take place at Hogwarts (It takes place in Durmstrang). I sense its going to take a while longer until it gets noticed. But I keep on swimming until it does

***** I hear ya. OCs are difficult to write and blend in. Not to mention getting readers to be interested in them as well. I think it's very courageous that you're writing about Durmstrang as so very little has been revealed about it. (Or perhaps it's easier for you since you can take it anywhere you want it to go).

​

From time to time I have to remind myself that the whole reason I started writing a long fic to begin with, is because I wanted to read the story that had not been written yet. Comments and praises are fun to receive but in the end I really don't want to depend on any of it.

****** The reason I chose Durmstrang was so I could take the usual Potter formula in a new direction. It contains quite dark humor and I strived after making the characters so realistic as possible even if that makes them seem less heroical(or more so maybe).

Also, if you take a look at Durmstrang from how it is described in canon it makes zero sense and I wanted to use that to my advantage in the story as a way of adding more conflict and drama when characters of multiple nationalities and languages collide.

** I was really disappointed with the reception on my last two fics. One is a multi-chapter Cursed Child fic with what I believe is an original take on the material, and the other is a one-shot about Sirius's escape from Azkaban. I thought (and still think) they were okay, but they didn't do very well and they've pretty well fallen off the radar now. It did damage my confidence and I don't write fanfiction any more (I do still write original fiction of course)

*** Most of my fics revolve around Snape. I'm currently writing a very long time-travel fic where Snape goes back in time to find Lily again and take of Harry's place in the upcoming war. (I just posted my 200th chapter).\\
I've also written a lot of short fics about Helga Hufflepuff, Luna Lovegood, Viktor Krum, Nearly-headless Nick and Sirius Black. My favourite thing to do is add real historical happenings or folklore into the story.

When I started writing it I didn't expect it would turn out as large as it did. I'm still rather disappointed in the first twenty chapters or so because of that very reason, as I didn't put as much thought and effort into it as I did further into the story. Still, I'm really proud of my accomplishments regarding the story so far.

********* Back in late 2015. I deleted 198 chapters halfway though 2017 when the roasting got too bad. Tumblr was still hot and happening at the time and the HP fandom was bashing each other down so badly that entire blogs were created revolving around just hating certain characters (and fics by extension). Fics with character bashing in it was rather popular in those years, and it's something that I thoroughly despise. Unfortunately for me, hating the Snape/Lily pairing was also hot item, so my fic got reported to the admins over and over again. I decided to upload everything back online in march of this year after growing more of a backbone (working at a prison really helped me with that). Now I just save all the hate comments onto a doc and read them from time to time just for shits and giggles.

Still rather proud of pushing out 400k worth of chapters in the span of a year and a half though. :)

*********** I think the major spark was just hating Snape. I wasn't the only one who got targeted by groups of troll reviewers. As far as I'm concerned I'm just happy that Tumblr is finally started to burn down to the ground. It really had become a breedingplace of negative bullshit that tore the whole fandom apart. I still don't particularly like the fandom for this exact reason. It's like with all the lack of new HP material any source material has been depleted and analyzed to death. It's why I'm happy to see you're creating your own characters and use Durmstrang as your main base. It's new and refreshing and certainly hasn't been done before. I don't have time to read it right now as it's late at night but I will start reading it in the following week.
