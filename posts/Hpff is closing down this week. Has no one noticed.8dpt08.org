** There have been half a dozen threads the last couple of weeks. Which is more attention than it had ever gotten here when the site was up and running.

Edit: And since everyone's been asking, [[/u/someorangegirl][u/someorangegirl]] had a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3an5ot/great_fics_from_hpff_primarily_oneshots_minor/][bunch of recs]] from that site which she posted a couple years back. She's an excellent writer, so I would trust her recs more than most people's.

** In just over two years on this sub, I have never seen HPFF mentioned as often as it has been in relation to the shutdown over the last couple weeks.

So no, no one at all.

*** Someone is archiving it, one of the mods want to host it on their wiki server and people are suggesting the archived copy be sent to AO3.
