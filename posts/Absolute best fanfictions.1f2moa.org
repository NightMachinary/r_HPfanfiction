I've read HPMOR; didn't really like it. Loved Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness, and its sequels. Read In Blood Only; thought it was meh. Read Broken Wings; loved it.

Suggestions? I want the best of the best. No restrictions otherwise, I don't mind slash, dark!Harry, long fics, anything. Just please mark the unfinished ones as so. It's a personal plus if Snape is a big character (not necessarily slash, more mentor-type. Yeah, I know a lot of you hate it, but meh) but not necessary by any means.

I'm not a Snape fan but this one is sooooo good. Mostly canon-compatible.

** My favorite fanfic is [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1962685/1/A-Stranger-in-an-Unholy-Land][A Stranger in an Unholy Land]]. Basically, Harry gets transported into an alternate universe where he is a Death Eater. It's nicely written, although I will admit there are some of the usual cliches (I still enjoyed it despite them though). There isn't much involving pairings. There is some manipulative!Dumbledore, but it's not anti-Dumbledore in the same way that HPMOR is. Although that fanfic is finished, it is part of a trilogy where the 2nd part stopped after 7 chapters (FF.net only has 4, but there are 7 total). The first one has a solid ending though and I'd highly recommend it! To warn you now, the first chapter starts off rather slow and Harry is with the Dursleys (this was written after OotP as a possible "6th book"), but I really recommend trying to read through the 3rd chapter before giving it up because the action really gets exciting after that.

Another fanfic I love is [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1248431/1/Promises-Unbroken][Promises Unbroken]], it's part of a trilogy that is complete. I haven't read all of the last part yet (since I've been too busy with school the last few years to read fanfiction), but I've reread the other parts several times because I really liked it. Sirius is the main character though, with more focus on him and the Marauders as adults than Harry and co (although they actually have some focus too).

Finally, my 3rd favorite would probably be [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nightmares-of-Futures-Past][Nightmares of Future's Past]]. It's still in-progress and the author is currently writing a very long Naruto fanfic too (I believe he'll write a chapter for one, then switch to the other), so updates come very slowly- maybe once a year. The chapters are /very/ long though. I like both of the fics by that author, very nicely written. He's more focused on pairings though to warn you (HarryxGinny is there pretty early on, plus some of the other main ones).

I also really enjoyed [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1260679/1/Realizations][Realizations]], it doesn't have a real plot but it's nicely written and more introspective in a way. Unfortunately it was abandoned some years ago though. If it hadn't been discontinued it might be one of my favorites, but since it leaves you hanging it's kind of frustrating.

If you haven't read these, hopefully you'll enjoy them if you get a chance! We may have somewhat similar tastes- I tried both HPMOR and In Blood Only and I didn't really like them. I'll have to check out the others that you loved though since I haven't read those myself :)

#+end_quote

I don't think HPMOR is at all anti-Dumbledore, and I think that if you're reading it as such you're badly missing out on the depth of Dumbledore's (and Quirrell's) character there.

#+begin_quote
  /Dumbledore fought a war against a Dark Lord who deliberately set out to break him in the cruelest possible way. He had to choose between losing his war and his brother. Albus Dumbledore knows, he learned in the worst possible way, that there are limits to the value of one life; and it almost broke his sanity to admit it./

#+begin_quote
  Again Moody shook his head. "No. It's the killing that does that. Murder tears the soul - but that's just the same if it's a Cutting Hex. The Killing Curse doesn't crack your soul. It just takes a cracked soul to cast." If there was a sad expression on the scarred face, it could not be read. "But that doesn't tell us much about Monroe. The ones like Dumbledore who'll never be able to cast the Curse all their lives, because they never crack no matter what - they're the rare ones, very rare. It only takes a little cracking."

As to Nightmares, I'm making my way through it, but it doesn't feel /compelling/ like some of the others, and the portrayals are a bit off, so I'm kind of forcing myself to read it because a lot of people have recommended it.

It's a community that only admits the best stories, according to the standards of the Dark Lord Potter Forums. But the community is IMO a little out of date, even when you consider there "high standards".

Right now I can recommend:

** My favourite fanfics of all time are the Alexandra Quick series by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/%20fanfics%20of%20all%20time%20u/1374917/Inverarity][Inverarity]]. They take place in the American Wizarding World, feature entirely original characters, and are damn near professionally written. There are four completed books with a fifth in progress. His other story, [Hogwarts: Houses Divided] is also very good.

Another great story is [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][Brown Coat, Green Eyes]] It's a crossover between Harry Potter and Joss Whedon's Firely. Sounds strange, but its excellent. Other people have lots of praise for nonjon's other stories, but I don't prefer them.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backwards With Purpose]] is an great time-travel story in which Snape plays a sizable part. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nightmares-of-Futures-Past][Nightmares of Futures Past]] is another time-travel classic, though it is unfinished and the author sometimes goes years without updating. The Denarian series by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/524094/Shezza][Shezza]] is another fantastic crossover, this one between Harry Potter and the Dresden books. I've never read the Dresden books, but was still able to easily follow and enjoy this series.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3186836/1/Vox-Corporis][Vox Corporis]] by MissAnnThropic is my favorite Harry/Hermione story.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4912291/1/The-Best-Revenge][The Best Revenge]] by Arsinoe de Blassenville is by far my favourite Snape-as-Harry's-Mentor story, and many of his other stories are also worth reading.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7413926/1/Chasing-The-Sun][Chasing the Sun]] is a superb Snape/Hermione story, by far the best I've read of that pairing.

This is of course by no means an exhaustive list. Check out the DLP C2 on Fanfiction.net, which several others have linked to. Another great tool for finding good stories is examining the favourite stories and authors lists of authors you already enjoy.

** [[http://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/khk06/fan_fiction_how_to_separate_good_ones_from_the/][This is my standard fic rec comment (fanfiction recommendation):]]

[[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?chapno=1&storyid=619][After the End by Arabella and Zsenya]] - Definitely one of the greats. It was started after /GoF/ and the epilogue was published the night /OotP/ was released. It's twice as long as /OotP/. It's one of the most faithful characterizations I've ever come across and was a totally plausible ending for what we knew at the time. Brilliantly written and you fall in love with the characters again.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650][Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always]] - One of the best [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail][For Want of a Nail]] fics out there. It all goes horribly wrong by the end and the only survivors are Harry, Ron, and Ginny. Nearly suicidal in their depression, they find a way to go back in time to make sure everyone survives. Make sure you read Parts II and III as well, although III hasn't been touched in 2 years.

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/barb/HPATPS.html][Barb LP's Psychic Serpent Trilogy]] - Another post-/GoF/ that covers Harry's last 3 years, I'm hesitant to suggest this. It's wonderfully written for the most part, but I've always felt there was a touch /too much/ personal drama in the relationships, as if she forgot they were just teenagers. But where the series shines is how very /British/ it feels. You get a much stronger sense of the geography and culture of the British Isles that I feel makes it worth the read. Also her oneshots [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/barb/MATB01.html][Mad About the Boy]] and [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/barb/HAH01.html][Horntails and Hippogriffs]] are /delightful/ and give you the fuzzies.

[[http://www.phoenixsong.net/fanfiction/stories.php?psid=2422][The F Words Series by Antosha]] - Taking place and published immediately after the last chapter of /DH/ (but before the epilogue), these are some of the most amazing fics I've ever read. You get to see the characters pull themselves together again after the Battle of Hogwarts. The next time you finish reading /DH/, start reading the series and prepare to have the bittersweet feeling held at bay for a mite longer. Although really everything by this author is amazing. His characterizations are always spot-on and his Luna is probably the best you'll find aside from Rowling's canon.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Methods_of_Rationality][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]] - If you haven't read this, you need to do so immediately. The hands-down most hilarious and brilliant fanfic to come out in years. From the description: "Petunia married a professor, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter... " This should be required reading for everyone.

There are more that I could suggest but I think these represent the very best in terms of story, character, and writing. Plus it's hard to come up with these lists.

If you just type in "fanfiction" or "fanfic" or "fan fiction" or "fan-fiction" in the search reddit box to the right, you'll find more threads.

As far as sites go, I'll second the recommendations for [[http://www.checkmated.com/][checkmated]] and [[http://www.simplyundeniable.com/][simplyundeniable]]. I'll also add [[http://sugarquill.net/][The Sugarquill]] (one of the earliest R/H repositories), [[http://www.phoenixsong.net/][PhoenixSong]] (which rose from the ashes of the great GryffindorTower), and [[http://www.thequidditchpitch.org/][thequidditchpitch]]. Fanfiction.net is like youtube: 99% crap; but there are still some real gems in there if you know where to look. Usually you can cut a lot of the crap by fiddling with the filters (rating>all, books only, word count > 100k, character pairings optional)

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8197451/1/Fantastic-Elves-and-Where-to-Find-Them][Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them]] by evansentranced - Complete - sequel in progress - The Dursleys ditch Harry in the forest on a family holiday and he decides since he lives in the forest he's an elf.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5453054/1/His-Own-Man][His Own Man]] by Crunchysunrises - WIP - Harry chooses differently in the Kings Cross of the afterlife and returns to his 11 year old body to make some different choices and save the lives of his friends. One choice is to become known to Narcissa and Draco Malfoy.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4912291/1/The-Best-Revenge][The Best Revenge]] by Arsinoe de Blassenville - WIP - Snape takes note of the address on Harry's school letter and decides to introduce him to the wizarding world himself.

****** I had mixed feelings about HPMoR, I enjoyed it a lot, but it definitely had major issues (long experience reading fanfic has left me capable of enjoying bad fics with redeeming features), mostly how god damned annoying and self righteous Harry could be, and the snapping fingers thing really came across as a combination of "LOL im so random" and the kind of cult of personality thing that often builds up around characters that the author loves too much. However, I really don't get how you could say Quirrell was out of character. We just don't know anything about Quirrell, since in canon he's possessed, and putting on an extensive act. Here he's also presumably possessed, and is putting on a different act, which may well be more true to Tom Riddle's personality than it is to Quirrell's.

For me, what makes that fic so amazing is the world the author creates and the complexity of the characters. It has a LV/HP pairing, and the author did such a good job with it that I actually enjoyed the pairing, which normally I would find grotesque.

I also love the Sacrifices Arc by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][Lightning on the Wave]].

** I love [[http://www.hpfandom.net/eff/viewstory.php?sid=19708][/The Apple Tree/ by Philo]] and have recommended it often. It was written after The Goblet of Fire, and departs from canon there, but it takes place in Harry's seventh year. That has been a bit hard for some people to catch onto, but now you've been warned you'll have no trouble.

It is slash, HP/SS, though Snape is unaware of Harry's identity. Harry has grown, secretly developing his special powers and his sense of self in the unchronicled years. Entering his seventh year, he is master of his fate and has a plan. And that is my favorite version of Harry, wised-up and proactive.

Under Harry's influence, other characters develop differently from canon. I absolutely swoon over this Neville, and Draco is well done, too.

And also, this story line acknowledges the strengths of the muggle world, which I personally enjoy, though I know not everyone likes their magical fanfic laced with the mundane.

**** Well to start off with it's epic. Not just in length where it clocks in at 88 chapters and over a million words and growing, but the story is as well. It has everything one could possibly want. It's action packed, and lots of intrigue and romance. The characterizations are great with plenty of drama and smart writing. The story is H/HR (my absolute favorite!) and Hermione is brilliant as always but as with everything in the story believably so without using her knowledge as a deus ex machina. Harry is wonderful and very powerful but with all of his new found power come smarter tougher and more interesting enemies. It hits all of the favorite tropes with unique and interesting spins and adds mind boggling amounts of new plot hooks and twists of his own. The scenes are described beautifully and the dialogue is great as well. The fic is pretty much an entire remake of book 6 and if I have anything at all bad to say of the story it's that once you finally catch up to the latest chapter you have to wait painfully and expectantly for the next to come out. However you can still rest assured that the next chapter will come out as he updates regularly if not as frequently as his addicts might hope. I even love his introductions which set the mouth watering for what is to come and his end of chapter author notes are amazing as well because you can see the intelligence and the attention to detail that goes into writing his fic... EVERYTHING IS CONNECTED! I know this post is very rambly and disjointed but I really love this fic and know everyone else who reads it will too so instead of taking my word for it judge it for yourself, just go to fanfiction.net or portkey.org (he updates chapters ahead of time on portkey) and look up Harry Potter and the Fifth Element. You'll be glad you did!

Anyway, I really enjoy the [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8670912/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Gift-of-Memories][Harry Potter and the Gift of Memories]] series. It's a book-by-book retelling of Harry Potter's life, but with the "twist" being that he has an eidetic memory and thus is more grown up, knew he was a wizard from an early age, etc. Each book is it's own story on fanfiction.net, and so far it's just the first year that's complete. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9196576/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Heir-of-Slytherin][Heir of Slytherin]], which is this universe's version of CoS, is still being updated pretty regularly.

Be warned, it has a couple of OC's, is intentionally a long-running Harem!Harry story, and occasionally the way it's written has a few harry-sue moments, but all in all it's well-written and quite engaging

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2301238/1/][Fizz]] by Kiki Cabou. /Summary: Harry has issues. Fortunately, he also has friends./ I think the summary says it all really.

Also, not sure of your opinion on crossovers but [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2452681/1/][Evil Be Thou My Good]] is a great crossover with Hellraiser, but all the Hellraiser elements are explained as it's from Harry's POV, so you needn't have seen the film (films?

- [[http://shoebox.lomara.org/category/shoebox-pdf-chapters/page/4/][The Shoebox Project]] by ladyjaida and dorkorific.

I can't find a summary for this. Sorry. It follows the Marauders and, to a lesser extent, Lily, from their fifth year through to Peter's joining the Death Eaters. I know there are far, far too many fics that do that, but this one's decent, honest.

Anyway. I wasn't a slash fan before I read this because I'd read some godawful Drarry at some point. However - this is a Remus/Sirius, by the way - the authors take real care in building up the relationships between R/S and L/J while also making the war feel real, as well as making Peter's betrayal a believable action while portraying him fairly sympathetically. Both the comic and serious parts of this fic - one of the few well-written dramedies of fic - are endlessly quotable and they really do resonate - with me at least.

There was a thread on this recently IIRC. It's a Lavendercentric (as you can probably tell) one-shot, and teh tarik does really like her description, so it might not appeal to everyone.
