Harry's magical core becomes tainted with dark magic as a result.


** You might have triggered so many redditors here.

Few of the things people hate in this subreddit:

- Magical cores

- Voldemort's memories

- People having different kinds of magic

- Dark magic

*** Well, we dont hate it. It is just not canon. This is so far out of canon that you cant even say it is AU.

**** That's only true of three out of four though. Unless you're arguing that Riddle had incurable short and long term amnesia, "Voldemort's memories" do exist in canon.

More seriously, while we know of no mechanics to access them, a copy of Voldy's memories /was/ presumably contained in the Scar Horcrux, since the Diary Horcrux had them. Unlike magical cores (or "dark magic" being a different kind of magic altogether rather than a type of spells), the concept of Harry accessing Voldemort's memories through the Horcrux does not violate Rowling's worldbuilding.

**** Canon never explained anything, so coming up with explanations is very much in human nature... Also, this things aren't really that AU as they are not going against canon, just adding to it.

In fact, Harry with a different name or hair color would be much more AU, so I don't get the hate...

***** The hate stems from two things I think.

First of all, most people have read through countless shitty fics where magical cores featured heavily as a plot device for why Harry was just sooooo much better than everyone else because his magical core was unnaturally large and golden and magically magic.

Secondly, it devalues the mystery and wonders of magic, which is inherently undefined in measurable way. Magical cores, their size and so on, implies there is a limit to how much magic someone can cast. It's basically adding POWER LEVEL to the world of Harry Potter which doesn't fit.

It's probably on par with OG Star Wars fans recoiling at the idea of the mystical force being something to do with midichlorians and Anakin's had over 9000!

****** To be fair, if they did it like in DBZ, where training increases your power/power level/ magical core, then I think we could have a decent fic.

*** Im a firm supporter of Magical Cores.... I believe it is a structure in the limbic system within the brain which is also a direct link to the soul... It would explain why emotions and magic is heavily tied.

Tom Riddle's diary had memories. I dont see why it would trigger people.

People do have different types of magic. Tonks is a metamorph. Voldermort is a parselmouth. Veela turn into birds. Warewolves and the moon. the list goes on...

Dark magic warps the body (hence the magical core in the brain as well) and the soul...

These are my type of fics... hue hue hue

**** You're mistaken on one account though. Unlike Parselmouths or Metamorphmagi (btw, please refrain from using "Metamorph"), Veela are another species entirely, more like Goblins or House-Elves, not a name for witches who happen to have a specific power.

Other than that... I don't have Magical Cores in my headcanon, but when it's something thought out like this, I like it. What ticks people off is when magical cores have sizes that limit how powerful a wizard can be from birth.

  Harry Potter is disappointed by the Wizarding World. A society wielding powers beyond imagination and it is wasted on Politics and Games. A psychotic Harry Potter aims to remind the world what it means to be a Wizard and to judge who is Worthy of Magic and who isn't.
