Who would win?


** Most Indy!Harry fics make him something similar to a reincarnation of Merlin so he would probably win.

** Sure, Genius Harry might be impressive with his ability to revolutionize magic using just his primary school knowledge on muggle math, science and physics. But Indy Harry? Oh boy, reality literally bends over backwards for him. He's a Childe of Magick. The only thing between him and world domination are the words 'so more it be'.
