Looking for something where Slytherin fight in the final battle because it's their school. Where they break away from their parents and see the bigger picture.


** linkffn(To Be a Slytherin by Morgana Deryn) includes a group of Slytherin's in the final battle, though its a long read to get there. Totally worth it in my opinion

** Shouldn't it be that they fight because it is the most obvious and logical cunning move?

They know the Dark Lord is losing so they fight to appear as a good guys but in the end its all about getting ahead and as you said the bigger picture.

​

If the Dark Lord wins they are forgiven for being children, if the idiot Harry side wins they are suddenly redeemed and accepted. Its a pretty much win win situation.

*** Why do they need to ‘appear' as good guys their only 16/17 none of them have killed anyone - even Draco. Why do people. Even the teachers assume that their going to fight for the dark lord. There's a difference between wanting to not share their school with Muggles and wanting to kill them. I think when push comes to shove most of them would react like Draco. Realising that there is a big difference between hating or not liking something (not saying it's a good or even right opinion) and killing people.
