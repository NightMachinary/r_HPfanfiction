Shortly following the war, Harry starts getting knocks on his door. He knew about Teddy, but not the numerous other children he was named guardian to in deceased or incapacitated parents wills. Some have other relatives that they live with and Harry acts like an uncle towards them, but there are still a few that stay with him. Being an orphan, he doesn't want to turn any of them away and ends up being a father to a fair good children sooner than he thought.

**** "I don't understand, Kingsley, how could I have been named Godfather without even knowing?" Harry ran a hand through his hair in aggravation. The week since the battle had been hard enough. He'd barely confronted the fact that he was Teddy's godfather, but this...

"I'm sorry Harry, the document has your signature on it." Sure enough, on Kingsley's desk was a contract that had what was ostensibly Harry's signature. Of course, it looked nothing like his signature.

"But I didn't sign it!"

"Yeah... the parchment seems to have a confundus charm on it. Legally, this contract is illegitimate, but magically its still binding. If you don't take the kid in, you'll lose your magic."

The only acknowledgment Harry gave to Kingsley was a hollow thousand yard stare, as the implications settled in. Anyone could bind him to any agreement they wanted, it was a /nightmare/.

"Harry?"

"I'm fucked."

  Long-distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances, but Harry and Ginny don't have the luxury of living normal lives. Their relationship is put to the test when Ginny returns to school and Harry stays behind to continue his Auror training. Ginny soon realizes her greatest challenge may be in coming to terms with Harry's fame and dangerous line of work and deciding if she can make the sacrifices needed to be part of his life. Sequel to Starting Over. (COMPLETE)

** I don't particularly enjoy the whole false magical contract thing, for me lots of parents left in their will that harry be the one to take care of their children after the war. Harry manages to send the majority of the kids to some other relatives (still constantly checking on them, reminiscent of his own childhood) but there are some poor kids that have nowhere to go and faced with the prospect of sending them to an orphanage, Harry decided to take them in.
