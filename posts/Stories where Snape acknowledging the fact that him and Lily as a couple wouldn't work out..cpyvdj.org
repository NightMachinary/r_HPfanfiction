I remember reading a story where Snape acknowledging that him and Lily where too different as people to work out as a couple and while it hurt that she choose James Potter to marry, it wasn't because he was holding hope for them to be together. Are there similar stories where Snape realizes that Lily and him wouldn't work out and just stay as friends?


** This is interesting, and I second the request. This would, I believe, require a mellower Snape, or at least a less self-deludingly melodramatic one --- and that hardly ever seems to happen outside of Snily fics, for the very good reason that his larger-than-life bleakness and cynicism are the main appeal of Snape as a character, even if, of course, they are not all there is to him as a person.

I think a /variation/ of this is definitely Snape's opinion in canon --- but in a bleaker and more byronic way. He sees himself as this tragic figure doomed from the start, clearly enough; being friends with Lily /wouldn't/ be acceptable, but he is also intimately convinced that he wouldn't have been worthy to breathe the same air as her (all the moreso after he, um, gets her killed). His reaction to realizing he and Lily wouldn't have worked out wouldn't be "let's still be friends," it would be "oh woe is poor me, poor Werther".

** I read a time travel fic where Hermione, now 40 and divorced from Ron(no kids) has a time travelling accident and goes back in time to when snap/potters are all about 19/20. She tries to change the course of the war fromt he shadows and diverts snape from the death eaters. She chases horcruxes. In it I believe she is black although they dont make a big deal about it. Snape, through falling for hermione, faces the reality of his a lily's relationship, and although Hermione gets them to reconcile, they end up as friends. I havent got the name of the fic though!!!

  Hermione thought the war was well over. She divorced, changed careers, moved on with her life... Until a workplace accident sent her back to the heat of things. Despite knowing better, she couldn't stop herself from breaking her own rules.

** I've been reading a fic that has Severus explicitly ackowledging a Snily relationship wouldn't work out in the long run. They can't stay friends because Lily's already dead by then, but you might still like the story.

It's an almost complete long fic (author is still updating). Note that it is both a Snape x OC and a Severitus fic. Don't know if that is your cup of tea. I've read you don't like different generation relationships. At least, this OC is an adult who has never been his student.
