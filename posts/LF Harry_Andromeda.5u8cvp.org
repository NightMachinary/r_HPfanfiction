  Harry considers the future of the House of Potter. Andromeda considers the past of the House of Black. Teddy is where they collide. It isn't always pretty. Immediately after Deathly Hallows and continuing through that summer. Complete!

******* Book Ginny has the following characterization: aggressive, brave, devoted, loyal, intelligent, powerful.

She was someone who would follow her love or hero unconditionally, and deal with persons who annoyed her quite mercilessly (e.g. Zach Smith and Ron).

She was actually not that different from Bellatrix. Especially if Harry turned dark or evil, she could become another monster.
