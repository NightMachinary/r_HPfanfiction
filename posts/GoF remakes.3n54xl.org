Hey guys, My favorite book to read about is the Goblet of Fire, since so many things can be changed from that single book. SO what are your favorite GoF remakes if you will and can we get links?

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.

  With help from friends, Harry realises that being "the Harry Potter" in the Tri-wizard tournament can only be a good thing. That, and learning to be a Blacksmith can't be anything other than cool.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew and Harry's inherent nobility leave a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature Harry bearing more effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance...

**** I started reading this a while back, but something in the earlier chapters sort of peeved me... Is the DF magic a lot more powerful than HP?

***** Not particularly, but there's a larger scale. You've got supernatural threats that are just more powerful than young human wizards.

***** Scalpel(Hp) vs broadsword(DF), they can do the same tasks, but each have things they can do far better than the other.
