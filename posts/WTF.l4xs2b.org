** I hate to admit I started a research into this. Not long, but went to youtube as a first (and hopefully last) attempt to understand the history.

There are some nicely editied videos, but what is most important is a panel "interview" with Tom Felton from 2011. Link with timestamp: [[https://youtu.be/Qrp-nQkSJNQ?t=18]]

Sadly I couldn't really find stories before 2011 either, it's probably on some dedicated Draco fanfic site from the early era. Also Drapple probably means something else too in the global fanfic community according to a quick search on ffnet and I do not want to know what it is.
