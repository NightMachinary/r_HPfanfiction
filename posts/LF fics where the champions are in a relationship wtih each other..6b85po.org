I've only ever read one fic like this, and I'm desperate to find more. Can anyone recomend any fics where Harry and the rest of the Triwizard Champions are all in a relationship with each other?


** I'm confused. Are you suggesting polyamory or a 'Harry/Any Triwizard Champion'? If its the latter I think "A Cadmean Victory" did that sorta. linkffn(A Cadmean Victory)

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

*** I'm suggesting polyamory, I thought that was pretty clear.
