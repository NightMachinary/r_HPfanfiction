Hi y'all

I'm running out of fics to read this summer. I'm looking for fics that feature Prof. McGonagall being a badass. Whether that's fighting or standing up for the students I'd like to read it. I'd prefer no slash or student/teacher fics. Thank you!


** Linkffn(Just a random Tuesday)

Canon compliant OOTP, a single day in the life of McGonagall while Umbridge rules Hogwarts.

  A VERY long Tuesday in the life of Minerva McGonagall. With rampant Umbridgeitis, uncooperative Slytherins, Ministry interventions, an absent Dumbledore and a schoolwide shortage of Hot Cocoa, it's a wonder she's as nice as she is.

**** These are just my opinion of her being a badass or just being savage, off the top of my head: - First book, she asks if she should turn Ron and Harry into a watch so they would be early, and when they say they got lost, she says “or maybe a map.” - Fifth book, basically any interaction between her and Umbridge. Namely, offering her a cough drop after she does her little “hem hem” and saying that Harry has gotten top marks in all exams “set by a /competent/ teacher!” Just plain awesome. - Offering to tutor Harry herself so he'll become an Auror, going against Umbridge vehemently - Seventh book. Her role in the Battle of Hogwarts, ordering the young students to safety while offering the students that are of age that want to fight a chance.

****** I guess it falls under OP's "standing up for the students", but yeah, "badass" would have been her successfully fighting off the aurors, rather than being stunned.

***** That's great but she did nothing about Umbridge's "medieval" teaching methods, aka torturing students.

****** She's one of those all bark no bite characters, with nearly zero contribution to the plot. Not even Dumbledore trusted her enough to let in on any one of his many secrets.
