I was recently reading a fic, when during the obligitary hagrid comes to get harry, Harry asked what the keeper of the keys does. If course, my mind jumped from a gnoundskeeper, to the person that controls the wards, to smiting ones foes.

What would happen if the title of "keeper of the keys" was more than just a title, but a tangible responisbiliy/power boost.

Where's my Indy!Hagrid.


** Now I'm just thinking of a crossover with the /Dresden Files/ universe where Hagrid moonlights as the Gatekeeper's assistance.
