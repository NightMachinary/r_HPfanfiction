I read a story on Fanfiction.net years ago where Harry enters an increasingly obsessive romance with a Slytherin girl (probably Daphne Greengrass), they spend time inside the Chamber of Secrets and Harry eventually kills her. If I remember right the end reveals Harry was influenced by the fumes of the rotting Basilisk inside the Chamber of Secrets into becoming so obsessed.

I've tried looking for it but with no luck.

******* I actually did find it off of DLP's archive. Thanks to you I knew its name.

Honestly the story didn't age that well but at least I read it again and can stop wondering about it.
