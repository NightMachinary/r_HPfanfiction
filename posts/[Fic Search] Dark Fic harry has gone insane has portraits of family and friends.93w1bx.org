I've been searching for this fic for Y E A R S and I cannot for the life of me find it. The only thing I really remember is Harry has gone quite insane and through some series of events has the souls or something like that of his family and friends locked in portraits and each chapter reveals a new one and through some weird magic and such transfers his essence into a portrait version of himself in the end, vaguely recall harry having lost a limb, I believe the Dursleys were locked in a cupboard under the stairs portrait ring any bells?
