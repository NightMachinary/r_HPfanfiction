I'm looking for fics where Dumbledore is a compelling character with depth, intelligent and competent, and the Big Bad of the story.


** Have you tried The Sacrifices Arc? It goes pretty in depth with Dumbledore

** Sympathetic Properties by Mr Norrell has a Dumbledore that is a fantastically-written Dumbledore that is absolutely certain that he's the good guy but his insanity has him being a complete /monster/. For example, he's proud of having blocked ICW aid to an African nation stricken by plague, because struggling together against that hardship will help unify that nation's people.

** linkffn(8163784) This answers some questions - why is an abused child so brave? Why wouldn't the Potters have fled England, if they knew the Dark Lord was seeking their child, personally? Alas, it has not been updated in two years, but the first major story arc was completed.
