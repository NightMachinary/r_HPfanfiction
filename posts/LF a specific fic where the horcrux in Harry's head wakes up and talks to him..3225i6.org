I can't remember much about it, but I remember it was set /after OotP/, and I think that Voldemort's possession of Harry is what caused it to become active. Does anyone know what the name of this story is?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4003405/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Unlocked-Knowledge]] could be this, but there are a ton like that. I'd need more specifics.

**** Since that is your story, I HATE YOU! I just read through all of it in one day, and its such a cliffhanger that I want to abduct you and force you to complete it.

**** Hey, really? I happen to be reading it right now. I enjoyed the one with Nicholas Flamel more, but this one certainly isn't bad.

***** It was my first fic, it has things I'd do a lot differently - I cringe a lot when I read it. And the amount of canon-rehashing is unforgivable in my own opinion. I guess it gets better later.

******* Thanks for the offer - I have a beta group at DLP that I used, a while back.

I write on occasion but it is rare enough to be constrained to a single story or fandom. The Seven Deadly Drabbles I posted had some of the best ideas, and I've written more on a few of them, now.

** Yeah, Unlocked Knowledge. I remember this one -- it was the first fic of this kind I read, though I prefer [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lily and the art of being Sisyphus]].
