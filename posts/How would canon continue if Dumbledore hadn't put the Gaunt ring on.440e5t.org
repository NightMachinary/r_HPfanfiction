** Snape wouldn't make the Vow. He and Dumbledore would offer Draco shelter, maybe pretending he died in his mission. Snape would be the next to be tasked with killing Dumbledore. He would "fail" and be banished from Hogwarts in the attempt, so he would appear to work full time for LV.

Dumbledore would find a better way to transport Harry out of Privet Drive, Harry's wand won't pwn Lucius' so LV won't be looking for the Elder Wand. Voldemort /probably/ won't manage to take control of the Ministry, but if he does, Hogwarts would remain Dumbledore's domain. Harry would probably return for a seventh year. Depending on the circumstances, taking the locket from Umbridge would probably be a lot easier. No sword shenanigans, they would destroy the Horcruxes with it.

If Harry would be at Hogwarts, he'd probably look for another Horcrux there and find the Diadem - though he might not find it straight away because he didn't Sectumsempra'd Draco and hid the book there (then again, Harry wanted to use the curse on McLaggen, so it might happen anyway). Not sure how they would know about the Cup or infiltrate Gringotts. Take it from there.

*** I think Voldemort would still be looking for the Elder Wand. He was first suspicious of the twin cores in GoF, and we have to assume there would be some kind of attack or assault on Harry again, because while Dumbledore's protection would make for better odds, it's inevitable that Voldemort would try to find a weak moment to attack Harry again and possibly the Weasleys or Hogwarts just to get to him. He might not have been so diligent in his search for the wand, but he would still have that solution on his mind.

*** I like your suggestions. I'm wondering if Draco would accept an offer from Dumbledore, or the very real threat of his family dying and I wonder where he ranked Voldemort vs. Dumbledore according to his view of the world. I don't think Voldemort takes control of the Ministry period.

Snape could also "try" to kill Dumbledore the year after. I don't know what Voldemort's deadline for Draco was here (quite literally a deadline too). I forgot about Slughorn too. Dumbledore still moves him into Hogwarts? Or is the pushed back schedule of Dumbledore not dying in the immediate future make him go about getting Slughorn's memory in another way. And if Snape is still teaching potions, Harry's not in there for the book.

**** I don't think so. The death eaters seem very much so a every man for himself situation. The opening scene to book 7 comes to mind; the other death eaters have no problem laughing at the Malfoys after they had fallen down the social ladder.

As long as Snape agreed to kill Dumbledore after Draco failed, Voldemort wouldn't care about an unbreakable vow. Considering how finicky the whole thing seemed, and that Voldemort didn't require them for every little thing, he probably considered the vow a really dumb thing to do. Too many chances to 'break' it and die on accident.

**** First, no one other than the Malfoys, Bellatrix, Snape, Dumbledore, and (doubtfully) Voldemort knew about the Vow. It was done in secret, the mission was a secret, Narcissa wasn't even supposed to talk about it to Snape.

He didn't have to make the Vow. Voldemort doesn't ask for Unbreakable Vows for every task he gives, the task wasn't given to Snape (Narcissa only asked for help) and Snape doesn't have to prove anything to Bellatrix. He only did it because Dumbledore already told him to.

But how to get to the Cup would be a mystery. However, if they knew about the Cup, they could use Tonks to impersonate Bellatrix, and they were even related.

  2015-10-27 - Forging the Sword: Chapter 16 update: My father was diagnosed and died of Leukemia this year, so fanfic writing took an 8-month hiatus. I am now writing again. About five months ago I made an executive decision, and chapter 16 now covers the entirety of the rest of fourth year. It'll be pretty big (best estimate at the moment is over 30,000 words) so instead of getting three 10,000 word chapters separated by a few months each, you should be getting the Durmstrang tournament as one 'book'. I think the pacing will work out better that way. Current wordcount: 21,000/32,000.

** Hm...I don't think Harry's role can be "diminished" even more (because in the last book he relies on luck, chance and the sacrifice of others even more than in the previous volumes! It's no wounder that Hermione feels more like the hero in that book!), he's bumbling along without much of a plan (why move around in a tent for example? A house under the fidelius would be better and they'd have food and maybe company etc. too).

Ok, back to topic:

I think Dumbledore would cancel his crazy plan, he might even appologize to Harry for all the crap he went through because of Dumbledore, with Harry as a human sacrifice (come on, that plan was just crappy and it's a wounder that it worked in the first place!).

Dumbledore might surrender the Elder Wand to Harry (to help him fight Voldemort, I mean the wand is supposedly unbeatable and it would be a great equalizer in a fight!) for the final fight!

Of course he and Harry would hunt down the horcruxes (don't like that plot-device, but it sadly is canon!) without going on an extended camping trip!

Snape wouldn't make any vows, hell the greasy bastard might even survive (sadly...that was the one thing good about that book IMHO: Snape getting what he deserved...I will never understand why people like him (or Draco for that matter - I hate bullies because I've been a victim of people like those two once!))

Hm...Hogwarts would become "Resistance Central" (because there's no way Dumbledore would surrender the school and even if the ministry falls Hogwarts can be defended - it's a castle after all with tons of wards etc.) and a siege would happen IMHO! That would bind a lot of LV's forces, so that the resistance would have some more space to move around (there might even be a guerilla-style war - I mean now the resistance kind of is in the situation that LV and the deatheaters are during the first war, so the order and left over loyal aurors would strike from the shadows, there might even be a phoenix-mark or something to show that there's still resistance!)

Also: Dumbledore might get international allies on board to help with the fighting!

Draco might die on his mission (would only serve that bully right, he got off in canon which isn't fair - he should IMHO rot in prison for a decade or two and his fortune should be confiscated to pay for rebuilding (same for the fortune of other deatheaters like the Lestranges, the Carrows etc.)) if Dumbledore doesn't give him an out (sadly he probably would...second chances, for killers no less, my ass...sanctimonious prick - sacrificing a child is ok, killing killers isn't? Ok Dumbledore, I don't think I'll follow you!)

***** The books were never building towards a huge awesome battle with spell-light shooting around and acrobatic flips and shit. Like, you'd have to not be paying attention to think it was going that way.

Voldemort is way more powerful, skilled and experienced than [seventeen-year-old] Harry (and pretty much everyone except Dumbledore). That fact has always been plain. The whole plot of the series is Harry trying to find a way to defeat him that doesn't rely on brute strength, because if he tried that he'd get his arse handed to him.

Like, were people expecting some sort of training montage where Harry emerged as Voldemort's duelling equal because reasons? It's so weird, half the time people complain because Harry rushes into stuff without thinking and then when he uses his smarts and only walks into a fight he's assured of winning and winning quickly they complain as well...

******* That's how it happened in the first place, isn't it? Baby Harry didn't defeat Voldemort in an impressive drawn-out thing. It was pretty much bam, he's dead. Personally I adore bookends like that in stories, where they open with the close.

Though to be fair I did expect an amount of flashy flashiness from the final battle - from the Elder Wand, not from Harry. And it did deliver somewhat. I think because we never saw it on screen people don't realize just how dramatic that last scene was - the bang like a cannon blast, the golden flames dead center between them. With a little creative cinematic liberty it would have been waaaay more impressive than the movie version.

******** Eh I guess we just disagree. I wanted to story to show Harry grow, not necessarily be the same as it was when he was a kid. Don't get me wrong, I don't want him to be equal to Voldemort, just a small chance where a character rose to the occasion to defeat evil despite the overwhelming odds. I guess I just prefer that type of story as opposed to some theory won the battle. I feel like Harry potter is almost more of a hero's journey for Dumbledore than for Harry, and I wanted it to be a hero's journey for Harry. I really felt like it was building up to that until years 5-7.

***** The power he knows not definitely wasn't any sort of dueling skill. In my opinion the best ending would have been a death eater(s) cursing Voldemort in the back for attacking Hogwarts of all places. Voldemort is a half-blood and used Pureblood prejudice for his personal gain. I think watching Harry stand up and fight someone he obviously can't beat in defense of the school would have been a fitting catalyst for this, and easily construed as the power-of-love and hand-of-the-other from the prophesy.

In the end Harry would have just been an ordinary wizard with extra-ordinary conviction, and it wouldn't have relied of ridiculous deus ex machina.
