I am looking for some good femHarry stories. (Edit: Looking through the Miss Potter community I should specify no crossovers except maybe Star Wars.)


** AU in which Harriet Potter is a half blood aspiring potioneer raised by her parents who wants to go to a pureblood-only Hogwarts at any cost. So she switches schools with her pureblood cousin Archie Black and takes on his identity. Fantastic worldbuilding and snarky characters with great plots. On fourth year by now. Linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense by murkybluematter)

Two oneshots covering 7 years at Hogwarts as experienced by a fem!Harry, the first oneshots a cisgender Harry and the second one a transgender Harry. The second one is better imho. Linkao3(the girl who lived by dirgewithoutmusic) and linkao3(the girl who lived (again) by dirgewithoutmusic)

Linkao3(charlotte the great and powerful by evandar) Oneshot covering 7 years of Hogwarts with a Slytherin fem!Harry.

Ongoing story about an immortal fem!Harry who was thrown back in time 5000 years after defeating Voldemort in seventh year and who lived through the millennia until the present day again. It starts after Voldemort was defeated so the entire story is totally original and there are plenty of flashbacks to what Jasmine (fem!Harry) has been up to throughout the centuries. Linkffn(A Long Journey Home by rakeesh)

Forty year old Iris Potter sends herself back in time after the world doesn't get better after Voldemort's defeat and decides to use the Black family to prevent the second wizarding war. Unfortunately she's hampered by being 5 years old. On hiatus since May. Linkffn(Potter vs paradox by belial666)

Those are the fem!Harry standouts imho.

There's also a fem!Harry/Regulus Black oneshot in which Harry rescues Regulus and they destroy Horcruxes together linkffn(flecks of rust by tsume yuki) and that author has a lot of romantic (but OOC imho) fem!Harry stories.

  Peeves, though he was nasty about everything else--ickle firsties and orphan girls--got it immediately. For all six years of Harry's Hogwarts tenure, he dropped water balloons on the heads of anyone who misgendered her. Professor Binns never quite figured it out, but he didn't know any student's name. Nearly Headless Nick gallantly and somewhat awkwardly called her lady and tried to hold open doors for her, despite the fact that he couldn't open them. Snape called Harry "Mr. Potter" for all seven years that he was in Harry's life. Around year three, Ron stopped counting the detentions he got for his increasingly sarcastic responses to this.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

  Harriet Lily Potter was left on the doorstep of 4 Privet Drive. They called her ugly and gave her Dudley's hand-me-downs. They would tell people that she went to a boarding school for troubled young women. Dudley still offered to stick her head in toilets, and she still learned to snap back, "Really, Duds? The poor toilet's never had anything as nasty as your head down it, it might hurt it," and run. Harry was the kind of girl who came home with scabby knees, who snuck the kitchen shears in the dead of night to snip her dark messy hair short. She wondered, as she curled up in her cupboard, if Vernon and Petunia would have loved a niece who was pretty instead of scrappy, who had soft hands and never burned the bacon at breakfast.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

** linkao3(2685965) Harry is reincarnated as Lily's sister, in the later chapters she starts having flashbacks (flashforwards?) to her previous/future life.

linkao3(422080) This one diverges from canon nicely.

linkffn(11862560) Sort of trans-Harry, and by the same author linkffn(11762909) born-a-female queer Harry.
