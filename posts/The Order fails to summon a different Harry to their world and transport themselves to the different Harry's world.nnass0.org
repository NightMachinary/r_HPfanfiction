** This world seed to be backward. Between evil Dark Lord HJ and little Tom Riddle the boy who lived, the order were not happy campers.

--------------

Harry stared in confusion as yet another wizard ran from him, screaming. Ron was quite confused why he was suddenly undesirable #3, Hermione was rather concerned.

--------------

Ginny decided that if she was the second most feared witch or wizard on the planet in this place, then at least other Harry loved other Ginny. She hoped Harry would one day like her. Maybe they could bond over society's newfound hatred of both of them.

--------------

Dumbledore stared suspiciously at the other Dumbledore. Dumbledore stared back at Dumbledore. Dumbledore is unsure about this, and so is Dumbledore. They both believe the other is no-good.

--------------

The Army, some twisted version of the DA kept sending Ginny and Harry letters. Some announce success in murder. Others are reports of infiltration in the Ministry. They all call him their lord. Harry is very scared.

--------------

HJ didn't know quite what to make of the snot nosed little brat who claimed to be him. Harry. It was such a terrible name too. It sounded bloody stupid. 'all hail Lord Harry'. Pfft. How the boy had ever survived Gryffindor was beyond him. Only the toughest, the most cunning could remain alive there. HJ laughed, red eyes blown wide with crazed glee.

The Dark Lord scanned through his followers, before his gaze landed on his favorite soldier.

"Ronald," he intoned, voice soft, almost edging on a hiss.

"Yes, M'lord?"

"There's sssome little green eyed poser ssstirring up unresst in our... Socsssiety. Disgusssting thing." HJ paused, fishing out a picture from his trouser's pockets. He handed it to Ronald and smiled.

"Kill him."

--------------

Abraxas Malfoy was an average Slytherin. He held his head low when he walked and tried not to draw attention to himself. He gasped in pain as Myrtle Warren caught him with a curse. That girl was as rotten as they came. They all hated him in this place, and every other place too. Being a pureblood was not very good for his continued well-being. Tom was lucky, in that way. The muggleborns never really cared all that much about the half-bloods. Then again, they tended to make an exception for 'golden boy Riddle'

--------------

Tom Riddle had the weirdest nightmare. It was like his visions from being inside HJ's mind, but a weird version. He was eating lunch with Weasley, notorious Azkaban escapee. Actually, he was eating lunch with all the Weasleys. The Weasleys who kept treating him like a child. Why he didn't curse them, he pondered after awakening, was a mystery. Tom stayed up for the rest of the night, listening to Abraxas snoring. He didn't mind the sound.
