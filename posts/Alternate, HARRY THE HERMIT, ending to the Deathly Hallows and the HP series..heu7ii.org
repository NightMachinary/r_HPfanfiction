/So I was discussing fanfics here in the community the other day, and we got to talking about how DH ended and, of course, there are people who aren't ecstatic about it. The consensus seems to be that Harry gets too happy an ending, and that there seem to be no after-effects to the war. So I started to mull things over and came up with I've begun to call '/*/Harry the Hermit/*/' ending in my head. I've read a fair few fanfics in my time, so some of these ideas may have been influenced from them. I'm not plagiarizing anything here and I certainly do not mean to take anything away from people who might have already dwelt upon these themes:/

/Everything up to the battle is canon. But here is how it ends:/

1. Everyone who dies in canon do end up dying. Lupin, Tonks, Fred etc. Ron sustains irreparable injuries and is left a cripple. Fred's demise and Ron's injuries cause Arthur and Molly Weasley a lot of pain and anguish, and they cool off on Harry.
2. The fact that he will never be a properly functioning human being again brings up all of Ron's issues to the surface yet again. He becomes embittered when the press begin to venerate Harry for killing Voldemort, Hermione because she was on the run with him (while, officially, Ron was in bed with Spattergroit) and, bizarrely, Neville, because he killed the snake and because of his tragic history. Neville becomes quite morbidly fascinating to the media. Meanwhile, the Weasleys with their scars, injuries and losses get shunted aside.
3. The Press, in true fashion, begins to link Hermione with Harry first (they were on the run from the Death Eaters, after all) and Neville next, and as the days go by, any bloke they fancy. Unsparing, they make up sordid details about Harry's and Hermione's supposed romance which unsettles Ron. Ron comes to the inaccurate conclusion that there really must be something between his two best friends. /(I got this idea from a fanfic called The Psychic Serpent Trilogy by Barb. Its set after GoF. One of the themes in that fic is that as sure as the sun rises in the east, a girl being close friends with two boys will definitely lead to a mess as they grow up)/ His resentment and self-loathing makes him to bring whatever he might have had with Hermione to a premature end.
4. Hermione journeys to Australia and sets her parents' memories right. However, they are not at all happy that they have been manipulated by her daughter. They accuse her, with reason, for walking out of their lives at age eleven and then interfering with them without explanation. The resultant fight leads to a period of estrangement between the Grangers and Hermione. Though they make peace, eventually, something has been irrevocably removed from their relationship.
5. Harry is overwhelmed by the press and media, who go on to paint him as they see fit. Despite their best efforts, his encounter with Voldemort in the forest comes to light. The Press, with Rita Skeeter in the forefront, begin to fabricate theories that Voldemort has discarded his body to inhabit Harry Potter's body and that the real Harry Potter is dead. They are successful to the extent that the Wizarding population is on the fence about who Harry really is.
6. Harry finds that the Weasleys rather have nothing to do with him. Hermione too cannot help him as she'd focus on trying to repair her relationship with her parents. Embittered, he goes on a downward spiral and walks away. Ron eventually agrees to assist George with the joke shop, just so he can have something to keep himself busy. Ginny gets her Quidditch break. She shoots to international fame but is stubbornly mum on her past relationship with Harry Potter. Though they become rich beyond their dreams, the death of Fred and the crippling of Ron forever shadows the lives of the Weasleys. Hermione's refuge is, as always, books. She devotes herself to academics and wins every award there is at Hogwarts, and comes close to replicating Dumbledore's academic achievements. In her later years, she becomes successful at the Ministry, known to champion every just cause there is. Her unrelenting focus on her career leaves no room for romance in her life.
7. Twenty-five years after the battle, a tenacious reporter manages to trace the reclusive Harry Potter to a remote island near the North Pole. The adult Harry is quiet and moody, and is living alone. His sparsely furnished cabin contains almost no traces of magic. He comes off as distant to the young reporter. With a trace of sadness, he confesses to the reporter that he is not seen Ron or Hermione in two decades.

Friends, this is the first time I've written something like this. Please, please read it and leave comments about what you think. Please upvote if you like it. Thank you!

​

EDIT - Neither Harry nor Hermione are perfect at the end of the war in this ending. The full extent of what she's had to endure the previous year crashes down hard on Hermione. She realizes that her friends aren't there to hold her hand or help or support her in any manner because they too have their own suffering to deal with.

Same goes for Harry. He literally ends up getting killed and surviving. After the war, he's simply overwhelmed. The Wizarding World does not want to take into consideration that he wants to heal, to introspect and to scrub himself clean of his misery and suffering. For the first time in his life, he tragically finds out that his support group, the people who always helped him get back on his feet and laugh, no matter what had happened - the Weasleys and Hermione - are crocked themselves and cannot do much for him. He suffers as a result.


** And then a random new witch who's super good at magic and is fighting a voldemort wannabe shows up at his island to ask him to train her to fight a dark lord and then harry dies and then she takes his holly and phoenix wand and also his last name even though she only knew him for a few weeks.

Her name: Rey Potter!

** Sorry, but I'm a sucker for happy endings. (Not that the characters shouldn't work extra hard to get them.) Real-life has plenty of bad endings- just turn on the news. Or visit [[/r/MorbidReality][r/MorbidReality]] if you're mentally stable and brave enough. So I like happy endings in books, movies, tv shows, etc. The characters should struggle and maybe get a bit tortured or maimed or even killed along the way. But in the end, the good guys have to win.

I can understand Harry leaving Brittain but maybe for New Zealand or the USA? He can always get help from a psychiatrist. Or find a new friend or love interest. Or get attacked by a new villain. I don't know if you watched them, but a few years ago Nolan made a trilogy of Batman movies that were pretty popular. So between the second and third movies, several years pass in which Batman is gone and Bruce Wayne is a recluse. But he eventually comes out again and by the end even regains some sort of... normalcy.

My point is that life goes on. Harry living indefinitely on the North Pole seems incredibly depressing and sad. I suppose he could do it for a few years and /then/ start the fic with someone finding Harry and forcing him to come back to the world. Actually, come to think of it this fic has a similar plot. But since it's not a request thread I'll just copy the link instead of using the bot. Harry drifts away from his friends after the battle and becomes an alcoholic and Draco of all people has to save him.

** As depressing as it is, I can see most of this happening (though I wouldn't want to read something so hopeless- I need my happy endings), but one thing that doesn't seem justified is the Weasley family distancing themselves from Harry. I understand why Ron does in this scenario, and I imagine that George would be pushing everyone away, but why would Molly and Arthur do it too? Do they blame Harry for Fred's death? It's not like he took a bullet for Harry, and I can't see them pushing away a young man that Molly has referred to as "as good as her son".

*** Yeah, well, okay. It does make sense that Molly Weasley wouldn't cut Harry off completely. But, she grieves for Fred first. As a mother who has lost her son, she takes her time to grieve and come to terms with it. Harry himself, on the other hand, is burdened by survivor's guilt. He blames himself. He feels tainted that by his association, the Weasleys have suffered a lot. He perceives Molly and Arthur's less than warm feelings (brought on as a result of the war and not necessarily because of him) towards him as something innately hostile and distances himself from them. Its a case of people not communicating properly.

*** Thanks! I might just try to write and expand it. I've got some ideas. This thing's stemming from my desire to see an alternate, realistic ending that echoes real life. I don't know if you've heard of the epic Mahabharata? The good guys and the bad guys (who are actually cousins) fight a war for the kingdom. Just when the good guys think they've routed the bad guys and won a great victory, a survivor from the bad guys' side sets their camp on fire, killing all their children, their kinsmen and everyone who had fought for them. So the good guys are left with a vast kingdom and riches, but no friends and family to enjoy it with. As a Hindu, I've always known that life usually finds a way to screw with you. That's the norm.

But, introspecting here, it's kind of a big thing they were in together - engineering the downfall of Voldemort. I guess they wouldn't completely forget Harry, but the few who are aware of his whereabouts would respect his wishes to be left alone.

He stared at an Avada Kedavra curse right in the face. There's going to be PTSD, and a lot of it.

It's the case of people talking about the splendid jacuzzi and the amazing modular kitchen in a newly built house and not paying any mind to the solid foundation without which the house and all its rooms would have come down like sticks. Ron has always been the foundation for Harry. It's not a glamorous feature, but an essential one. Unfortunately, the press doesn't want that.

** I really like this, I would love for this to be a thing I would read that right now. I love the angst and hardships that everyone goes through because happy is boring for me. I want to see some dark stuff happen because that never really happens in books; where the bad guy wins or the hero's in the story don't get their happy ending: this right here is so much more interesting for me because you could do so much more to the characters if they didn't win in the end. What would they do if they were faced with this much failure? How could they go on with their life? Because the books don't go into this kind of detail that you made right here because they are the heroes they have to have their happy ending after so much death and destruction. But what if they don't...?

** Got kinda Madley in Love vibes, but Madley is a tax person (I think) rather than a reporter.
