It's been 2 years since my last glance at the HP community, and now I'm bored. Oh how I missed this, anyhow.

I'm looking for some nice Harry Centric fics. Around 60k+ would be preferred.

Some Ideas of what I would hope you guys could recommend.

- Friendless Harry. I mean the kid grew up lonely with Dudley bullying him, got to be wary yknow? He sticks to the shadows etc.

- WBWL fics but without the whole dark harry stuff. I've read my fair share and I think i've read most of em ngl. If you have some you think no one has read of a Dark Harry, shoot! I'm free to read.

- Mute Harry. Where harry just chooses not to speak.

- Genius Harry without the whole dark or pampered harry.

You get the gist of it, something nice to read.

Any would be nice, thanks!

** If you don't mind female Harry and self recs, I have a mute female Harry fic. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25917352/chapters/62988739]]

As for a WBWL without dark Harry, The Prince of Slytherin has a powerful and political Harry, but he isn't dark or amoral. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1119027]]

** This weirdly checks off many from your list: linkffn(Genius Fratris) features a WBWL, Slytherin Harry who isn't dark, and is actually rather kind. He lives with James and his little brother. He also suffers from selective mutism and struggles with being bullied/accepted.

  Only two people know what happened the night John Potter became the Boy-Who-Lived: Lord Voldemort and Harry Potter. And neither of them are talking.
