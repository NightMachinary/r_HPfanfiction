I am looking for a fic I read many years ago. Harry defeats Voldemort and leaves the Magical World. Eventually his daughter attends Hogwarts not knowing that her dad is Harry Potter and begins writing to him as a pen pal. I remember that it ends with Harry pretty much bitch slapping the Magical World. Anyone remember anything like this?

**** I feel like you will really enjoy The Nightmare Man series by Tiro on [[https://ffn.net][ffn.net]] . It is quite similar but different enough to be interesting.
