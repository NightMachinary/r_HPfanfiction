The story takes place I believe between 5th and 6th year, Harry is depressed and heads to the park alot and eats tons of junk food. He tames a Squirrel in the tree that he sits in. Him and Dudley reconcile and Harry meets Dudley's Girlfriend. Harry gets invited to a Party by Dudley and the girl I believe and he takes the Squirrel, the last thing I remember reading was that Hermione was at that party with a cousin or something


** I've never read this, but it sounds interesting.

I'll be keeping an eye on this thread, thanks!
