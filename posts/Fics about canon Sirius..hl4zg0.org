** Hi :) I'm currently working on a couple of Sirius/Black family-centric fics. The first is Circinus, which is an AU in which his mother saves him from Azkaban and, along with his grandfather, secures him a trial. I'm still in the early chapters but it will be a rather long and detailed one, in the long run. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23559502/chapters/56518936]]

The second is The Dog Days of Summer, which centres around the summer when Sirius was ten. It's basically a whimsical tale set at the Black family country estate and features magical creatures wherever possible. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21737692/chapters/51857092]]

I try to stick to characterise Sirius as canon as possible, but my characterisations of the wider Black family are very heavily influenced by Izzythehutt's Black Sheep Dog series, which is a brilliant AU in which Regulus survives the cave, which leads to Sirius getting roped back into the family. Check it out, it's brilliant :) [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1036611]]

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23655241/chapters/56780728#workskin][Ozymandias]] - linkao3(23655241) Hi! I'm currently writing a fic that's an OoTP AU where Sirius's mother, Regulus, and his grandfather are all alive and in Grimmauld Place when he goes to claim it for the order. There's definitely no wolfstar (no need to worry on that front lol) and Sirius's characterization is not fanon influenced at all. Feel free to check it out :)

  The Black Family had seen its rapid decline over the course of five years. Now, with the apparent death of the last male heir, Arcturus Black presides over a dying dynasty, Walburga Black begins a slow descent into madness, and Sirius Black is jailed in Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit.However, Arcturus isn't content on letting his ancient family name die out just yet, nor is he all that keen on handing his estate to the terribly déclassé Malfoys. So he, along with Walburga and a very reluctant Lucretia, begin a quixotic crusade to free their wayward heir from Azkaban.Meanwhile, in a more bucolic setting, Regulus Black lives in peaceful self-imposed exile after faking his death to protect his family from his betrayal. Until one night, he finds the long-forgotten mark on his forearm is burning once more.What happens when this highly damaged, emotionally constipated, extremely dysfunctional group of individuals meet under the roof of Grimmauld Place 16 years later in the midst of the second wizarding war?Chaos. Utter chaos.Set mainly during the events of OoTP, with a relatively lengthy prologue covering the years from 79-95.

** It's not /entirely/ canon Sirius but it's the closest I can think of for Golden Trio Era

Linkffn(A Bond of Family by Daily-Chan) warning it's part of a series and you'll need to read the previous parts first.

It's not wolfstar, Sirius and Remus are very tactile with eachother and people think they're a couple which is honestly hilarious bc Sirius is just completely oblivious to it.

Linkffn(Saving Sirius by imaginationcelebration) is Marauders Era with slight wolfstar but it's emotional and I cried.

  He doesn't tell them how much it hurts to be hated. In truth, it hurts more than he'd like it to. Caught up in hurt and self-hate, Sirius turns to drastic measures without thinking it through properly. Remus finds his friends bed empty and goes in search of his lost friend. Very Mild Wolfstar.

**** Have you read the linkffn(Innocent) series? It's in progress but over a million words already, and regularly updating. No special Black family magic, no womanising (he does get a long-term girlfriend, but no one else), just him doing his best to do right by Harry.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.
