I was talking with a friend the other day and we talked about how wizarding North America would be. It turned that we both agreed the French in North America would have a country of their own shared with the Natives (actually shared with both of them as distinct and equal) since what was called Canada at the time of the passing of the SoS was controlled by France and England could only dream of having the territory. What do you think?


** Well, that's the question, right? Do the magical countries follow the Muggle post-Statute development? Is Germany divided into three hundred [!] countries, or is there just one Germany? Do I live in the Kingdom of Bohemia being ruled from Vienna? Actually, was Scottland and England already one country?

*** I once read a framework for the greater magical world that had magical germany be part of the holy roman empire, which survived into the modern day, but only on the magical side.

*** The Scottish and English crowns were unified when the SoS came into effect but the kingdoms weren't.

Hogwarts was founded in around about 990 (long before the SoS), only a few years after England was unified politically and before mainland Scotland was unified - Strathclyde was at least nominally independent until the eleventh century IIRC. At various points in the 700 years between the founding and the union of muggle England and Scotland, Scotland was a vassal state, conquered territory, a friendly independent neighbour, an ally, an enemy, and so on.

All of which is to say ... muggle borders don't appear to matter much to magicals.

**** I meant in the time of SoS.

“crowns were unified, but the kingdoms weren't” ... you mean it was a personal union, two separate kingdoms with one person holding the crowns for both of them? That was the same as what become the Austrian Empire at 1804. Until then all Habsburg emperors have titles like “Joseph II., the Holy Roman Emperor, King of Bohemia, Hungary, and Croatia, Archduke of Austria, ...” and long long list of lesser titles.

** From my notes for a fic that'll never see the light of day:

- Canada (Western provinces/territories up to Ontario)

- Athabascan Territories (Alaska, Yukon, Nunavat, Northwestern Territories, extending to include the northern part of the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec)

- Acadia/Acadie (Quebec, the Maritimes and part of Maine.)

I imagine that some areas in "Canada" would remain unceded territory for various tribes, however.

** Why the he'll would the French share a country with the First Nations?

I'm of the opinion that French Canada would take the Quebec, Newfoundland, N.S. and N.B. Region, while English Canada would take the other Provinces. I would have the First Nations be mostly in the Territories and Alaska, in some sort of tribe system.

Maybe the F.N. would constantly venture into the southern Provinces and have to be beaten back every now and then.

*** I like it, but I think the indigenous communities would have to be treated on a case-by-case basis. The tribes on the west coast are very different to those up north and those out east. Especially for the west coast ones I can't imagine them wanting to give up their land willingly, since that's where the red cedar trees are and they were less nomadic (if not mostly sedentary? I don't remember) than northern tribes were.

***** So what? They'll exterminate them like the British and Spanish did and make them retreat to small enclaves? The French were very friendly to the First Nations except, obviously, for those who attacked them like the Iroquois, who literally exterminated the Hurons. The French would still need to learn about the different magical plants and creatures from the continent and if the French wizards were anything like the Muggles in their colonisation tactics then they would have been vastly outnumbered by the Natives. The French also had a tradition of gift giving with the Natives, to show their friendship with them.
