I remember reading a fic back in about mid 2008. In it, Harry was dark and engaged to Luna. It had some Hermione bashing in it, I think, or maybe she just didn't really appear much?

Anyway, one scene I remember is that Harry bought tons of old House Elves and strapped high grade muggle explosives to them, then sent them to explode in the Ministry. The fic was mostly non crack apart from this moment.

Anyone know of it?
