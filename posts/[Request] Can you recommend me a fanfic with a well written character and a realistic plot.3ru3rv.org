Granted, I've read a lot of HP fanfics, and found them a tad too cliched when I've looked back. Either the character is overpowered and the plot twists itself to showcase the character's greatness, or the characters have less substance than I prefer. Or the plot is contrived. Can you recommend me a HP fanfic (not romance unless it is exceptionally well done) that is well written?


** linkffn(6730432) - A "Harry is pulled into another universe" fic if you're OK with that. I don't think any characters here are overpowered -- they all have their issues.

  AU after the last chapter of DH. Harry gets pulled into another universe to deal with the problem of Voldemort there. But that is not the worst thing that could happen. Mostly gen, with Snape mentoring Harry. COMPLETE.

** I am happy to help you, Theminionking. It sounds like you're bored to tears over the usual fanfics that are an excuse for the writer to say "Look at my awesome!" I have just the solution. What you need are character-centric stories.

This one is one of my absolute favorites across any fandom: "Faith and Understanding." It examines the friendship between Ginny Weasley and Luna Lovegood. I think it's an underrated gem and I cannot recommend it enough. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3821794/1/Faith-and-UnderstandingThis]]

Not quite as good as "Faith and Understanding," but "Revelations" provides an interesting take on Hermione's friendship with Luna. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1882884/1/Revelations]]

This one's gained popularity recently. "Cauterize" is nothing short of tragic. I cried. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/Cauterize]]

If I think of any more, I'll be sure to post them for you.

**** You're welcome. Those stories were some of my favorites and a blessed relief from shipping.

Platonic friendship fics are vastly underrated and good ones are rare. "Faith and Understanding" is in my top ten fanfics of all time.

** linkffn(A Promise From Her Boy) is pretty good. It's not a romance (thank god) and it doesn't have anyone who's the ultra supersaiyan wizard god or anything like that. It's also canon compliant, if that means anything.

  It did not occur to Harry Potter to wonder why his Snowy Hedwig was so much more affectionate than the other owls. It did not occur to him he would ever need to care. That's why she waited to tell him. (Canon compliant)

** Okay, I rec this for everything, but the /Alexandra Quick/ series is really exceptional. It's perhaps the best-written series in the entire fandom.

linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle) is the first "book". It's a bit rough, but if you get through it, the second through fourth books are extraordinary. They really, really are. The plot is primarily character-driven - unlike in HP, where the plot dictates what the characters do, often derailing up-till-then established characterisations.

  The war against Voldemort never reached America, but all is not well there. When 11-year-old Alexandra Quick learns she is a witch, she is plunged into a world of prejudices, intrigue, and danger. Who wants Alexandra dead, and why?
