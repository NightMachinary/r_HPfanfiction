Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash, Asexual/Bisexual, Etc.

Anyone can be the MC/Any Site/Any Length/Old or New

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine

Would rather not have crossover stories.

  It seemed like a routine assignment for CI5 officers Ron Weasley and Harry Potter: Investigate a physicist who had caught the attention of some unsavoury elements. Little did they know that Dr Hermione Granger would turn out to have more secrets than Ron would have thought possible.

  Harry is a Guide with a secret. But when revealed, the whole world seems like it's out to get him. First The Ministry, then an 'Order', and now a hit man from a covert organization bent on eradicating his kind. The hired gun seems to have an agenda of his own though. But what could Tom, an Alpha Sentinel, want from Harry? (A Tom/Harry Assassin, Omegaverse, and Sentinel/Guide AU).

  Lily remembered her sister, how there had been a time she was curious and delighted about magic, before it slowly sank in that she could look and not touch.The last thing Petunia had said to Lily before she died was a chilly goodbye, ending a holiday dinner where they'd had a shrieking row in the entryway. Petunia had said 'freak' and Lily had hissed 'better than this, better than this being my whole fucking world, Tune, do you even see yourself, are you happy--'And now here was Dudley Vernon Dursley fussing himself to sleep as Lily walked the halls of the Godric's Hollow house. His tiny soft hands with their tiny soft fingernails curled under her chin, the same way Harry's always had.She passed James, who was gently bouncing his way up the hall the opposite way. "I think he's asleep," James mouthed over Harry's tousled head. His hair was the same mess, his head bent down as he peered at his sleeping son.Lily stopped where she stood, her nephew heavy on her chest, her husband smiling, her sister buried. "James," she said. "How are we going to do this?"
