I was thinking what i'd do in a SI fic and I realised that i'd probably end outing Pettigrew on the train and with the way the Wizarding World works he'd get a mild fine for being an unregistered animagus and nothing else because Sirius "confessed" to the murders and there's no law against being a crap friend even if they did work out the Secret Keeper thing.

Heck he could probably just tell people he got cursed to remain a rat forever by Sirius, the finger falling off was him trying to turn back and the curse taking a body part so he got scared, moved in with a wizarding family in the hope they would notice and get him help. Why would anyone willingly stay as a rat? It makes no sense. I'd demand veritaserum of course but there's no evidence it would actually be allowed in a trial.

The Weasleys get mocked by everyone for not helping, Ron resents Harry, Harry ends up with no friends and no one to help with the Stone and Voldemort is back within a year.

Oh and the ministry put anti-animagus spells on Sirius' cell now they know about his form and he never escapes.


** Live the life of an ordinary child going to classes and all, and watch as the world descends into chaos by end of year 2 tops.

Edit: and if Sirius manages to escape in year 3 - take off with him to somewhere warm and sunny.

Like, grand, it's magic, but you're learning levitation and lighting your wand up. After a while that will get old. But you're in the position of either spending hours changing beetles to buttons to progress, with no help from teachers, or just sitting there doing 11 year old level work.

I don't see myself as a Hermione-type in the slightest, but I think if I found myself in the wizarding world, I would be curious about everything, and would just want to learn so much!

****** It would be just like spending a lot of time on the internet, only without the convenience of it.

Sure, i might not be learning how to do every single little spell and such, but the amount of knowledge, trivia and entertainment contained within the library of Hogwarts would definitely make enough of interesting material to read on and sometimes practice.

I mean, if i can spend day after day reading and watching stuff on the internet (and occasionally regular books, or playing some games and whatnot) i could definitely pull the same reading books about magic, magical fiction, some other books, watching Quidditch, playing chess, socialising and trying to do magic. There is just a slight change in the convenience of the medium that i'd use.

It's not like i'm going 'OMG this internet stuff is so amazing' and sit starry-eyed looking at the google starting page, i find something on one page or another and spend my time on it if it's interesting enough. It would most likely be the same being let loose in hogwart's.

*********** So, I partly agree and partly don't. I agree that by the time you've completed a higher degree, you've learned how best to learn. However, your brain also most definitely slows down and you learn less quickly (albeit more efficiently), and your knowledge base specialises and loses a lot of the breadth.

I'm in the latter part of my PhD and have two masters degrees on top of my bachelors, but the idea of going back to the range of broad subject examinations we had in 4th, 5th and 6th year of secondary school back in Scotland, particularly if it were new subjects I hadn't chosen to study at the time (so not a recap), is something I'd find quite daunting.

On top of that, magic has a level of practical skill beyond just understanding of theory, and learning a new practical skill (or multiple of them) is a completely different thing to an academic education. Charms even gets compared to an art, which implies more than just something you eventually gain muscle memory in. I personally think this would make it just as tricky to be an educated adult brain in an 11 year old body starting Hogwarts as an actual 11 year old, if not harder, because you might also be driven slowly and surrounded by actual 11 year olds...

The work ethics, discipline and attention span you develop when doing something difficult also translate very well to just about everything.\\

Probably should just let year 3 play out but maybe keep a closer eye on Pettigrew so that he might not escape this time. That should keep the worst aspects of year 4 from coming to pass at all. Keep an eye on Moody just in case. Shouldn't have PTSD in 5, might make it easier to protest against my abusive DADA teacher, seeing as everybody wont be labeling me a nutter. Maybe I can get Dumbledore to figure out the horcruxes connection earlier in year 6. We shouldn't have to deal with any dark lord plots so it should be mostly reasonable to find them, especially with my basically seer knowledge of where they all are, how to obtain them, and how to destroy them (and what curses may be released as I do) Itll be nice actually getting to study through year 7 and be properly entered into the world. May have to deal with Voldie at some point. Magic KKK still might feel like bringing him back somehow and potentially find a way but he wont have his horcruxes at least so maybe I'll just carry around a pistol.

Original comment:

I've talked about this before but basically wait until I arrive at Hogwarts, avoid Snape and Quirrel's gaze and try to get a meeting with Dumbledore as quickly as possible.

Convince him I'm telling the truth and tell him about: Quirrel, Pettigrew, Couch, the Horcruxes, etc

Warn Dumbledore about the ring

Canon Dumbledore is powerful and careful enough to deal with everything

I'm doing this because even if Harry won, Voldemort was still in power for a year and I don't want to have to deal with being under that regime. Also my knowledge could avoid the death of many

Finally, Harry won through a bit of luck, and I wouldn't be surprised if my presence was enough of a butterfly to change things badly

Afterwards I would just enjoy learning about magic and live in the library forever

But yeah, I feel like Dumbledore is better equipped to deal with Voldemort than 11 year old me.

Things that could go wrong: Dumbledore for some reason doesn't listen about the ring and get cursed. By second year Dumbledore is dead

Or: Fudge doesn't like the scandal about Sirius, has both him and Pettigrew kissed before the news can find out

Well, you also have too look at it the other way around. Voldemort gaining so much power and influence was what lead to the swingback after his fall. All the pro-house elf legislation and abolishing Azkaban and stuff wouldn't happen if the status quo wasn't violently disrupted. Instead you'd be stuck with Umbridge's werewolf genocide and Malfoy's slow crawl into power.

The way it went in the books might be the best case in the long run..

Kill rat Pettigrew as quickly as possible. Sirius probably doesn't escape or get proof is his innocence

Get your hands on one of the Horcrux and hide it

Carefully tell Quirrel that Dumbledore knows about his Horcrux, make him move everything. Also tell him about the prophecy and warn him about Harry's magic hands

Basically make the Horcrux much harder to find, or scare Voldemort enough that he makes more

** R I G H T!

I'm stealing the Philosophers Stone and (at some point) the contents of the Restricted Section (I'll let Quirrell take the blame, he'll be dead who's going to check). I'm selling anything of value from the Room and unleashing a flock of roosters in the Chamber of Secrets.

I'm staking out the Chamber of Secrets and mugging possessed Ginny for the Diary (store all the Horcruxes and books in my vault) and I'm stealing some dickheads wand as well (perhaps several wands).

I'm then, either at Christmas or Summertime, sneaking away to Little Hangleton and (using that stolen wand) using the Imperius on any Muggles I need to in order to get the ring. To throw off the Trace, I'll take a trip to Diagon, Knockturn or Hogsmeade for an adult to be my "fall guy".

If I need a wizard, I'm hunting down Mudungus Fletcher or using my spare wizard/witch or waiting to see if I can get Dobby or (later) Kreacher to do it for me.

Assuming the Muggle world is the same as ours, I'm converting some of my Galleons to invest in Muggle businesses whenever/however I can get away with it.

I'll probably Imperio Malfoy so he doesn't take Care of Magical Creatures in the first place (that will hopefully save Buckbeak) and I'll cage up Pettigrew at some point in third year and make it look like Crookshanks killed him. Whilst I'm here in third year, I'm not taking Divination.

Now. I'm going to use the Imperius (and if I can steal it, Hermione's Time Turner) to let Dumbledore and Fudge etc. see Pettigrew but still allow him to escape and join up with Voldemort. Fingers crossed, that allows the events of Goblet of Fire to continue as they should. This should exonerate Sirius whilst still keeping things predictable.

I'll let Crouch put my name in the Goblet of Fire and allow events to continue as normal, the only thing I'll change is going to the graveyard alone. I'm going in guns blazing, AK's all the way. The plan being to kill Pettigrew AND Nagini whilst still keeping Voldemort alive. As insurance, at some point I'll fleece either a Basilisk fang or Godrics Sword (whichever is easier to obtain) and sneak it into the final task as an alternative.

Then, I'll keep Baby Tom in a box until I've tracked down and dealt with the other Horcruxes. And when I've done with them all... mwahahaha!

I'LL SMASH IT WITH A HAMMER!

It's brilliant, Brilliant, BRILLIANT!!!

Then, probably retire somewhere with my riches, the world entirely unaware that it had been in danger in the first place.

** Try to learn the killing curse and when the opportunity presents itself, cast it on Dumbles. He wouldn't suspect it at all and if I was fast enough it'd be pretty easy to kill him. When he's dead I commit suicide. The wizarding world is now missing its savior and its warrior of light. As a result of this, public morale is pretty bad. Then, because the mirror wasn't yet deployed in the third floor corridor, Quirrel gets the stone pretty easily. Voldemort should then be able to quite easily access his support base and gain control over wizarding britain. The statute of secrecy would be close to breaking because Voldemort encouraged muggle-baiting and the such. This would result in international conflict as other countries try to stop Voldemort from revealing wizardkinds existance. The resulting war would of course not help conceal wizardkind, and the muggles would stumble upon a species engulfed in war. They'd be swept into the conflict, and because magic is so powerful, nuclear weapons would be thought to be the only answer. Nuclear war would then result in destroying humanity.

** Honestly, I wouldn't tell anyone anything for fear of making things worse. Instead I'd just try and stealth my way through until after the triwizard tournament then reveal myself to dumbledore as having "visions of the past and future" that I'd done my utmost to prevent. Step one would be murdering Pettigrew in his sleep during first year (Ron would be upset, but I could live with that), step two would be to get a rooster and go kill the Basilisk as early as possible, step three would be to find the diadem in the RoR and use the dead Basilisk as a source of fangs to kill it with, step five would be to destroy the vanishing cabinet in the RoR. Step six would be to spend as much time as possible politely and quietly inquiring into friends of Harry's parents to "find out" about sirius. Step seven would be to try and arrange a visit to Sirius in Azkaban (this will take a long time to accomplish) and after being "surprised" by the way he acts in prison to see about getting an investigation opened into him to try and get him freed. All the while I would be spending as much time as I could trying to learn curse breaking so I could hunt down and eliminate the various horcruxes without anyone knowing. Eventually I hope to find some sort of exorcism ritual to remove the scar in Harry's forehead, thereby completely eliminating Voldemorts anchors without him ever coming back.

But you say, "that sounds like a good thing, aren't you supposed to mess stuff up as much as possible as per the prompt?". "yes", I answer, "and that is exactly what I am doing". The thing is, one evil man does not an evil society make. Even Hitler needed an entire political party backing him to be able to do the things he did. And although the Nazi party was no more than five guys in pub backroom when Hitler joined them, all the people that he would go on to recruit were still out and about in society.

On a net historical scale, Voldemort was probably a good thing. The reason being that he was able to gather together nearly the entirety of Magical Britain's bigots, sadists, racists, murderers, monsters, and amoral mercenaries under a single banner. Which conviently put them all in roughly the same place at the same time which allowed them to utterly decimated by the end the second blood war, which paved the way for sweeping reforms and an overall restructuring of magical british society.

Magical Britain was already deeply sick, cancerous even, voldemort was simply most dramatic symptom. The second blood war was the purging fever that got rid of the illness. By eliminating Voldemort before he has a chance to gather together his followers you allow those same bigots, sadists, racists, murderers, monsters, and amoral mercenaries to go on slowly poisoning Magical British society unchecked, and most importantly, /undiscovered/. A whole society of cancer patients, none of which even know that they have tumors. Yes, I'd say I ruined Magical Britain quite nicely. And the cherry on top? I did it by doing something that is indisputably morally good. I doomed magical Britain by killing its worst monster.

** You mean I'd want to make thing better, because my knowledge of canon, but it actually makes everything worse?

Pettigrow is a big one, of course. But I think I would try to go directly to Dumbledore to explain about the Horcruxes, and where they are, and how to destroy them. Which he destroys.

However, it makes things worse because Voldemort is not back yet, and he can't kill Harry. So, I'm still an horcruxe, and would be for life. (If anyone else than Voldmort could kill Harry, then the horcruxe would have been destroy in year Two when Harry was bitten by the Basilic).

So Harry spend his life as an Horcruxe, which doesn't seem fun at all, and Voldemort is still looming over there. Unable to return. And the wizarding world spend decades in fear of Voldemort's return, never at easy.

Especially since Voldemort would still make many attempts and I would have to live in fear and paranoïa all my life. Or in Hiding.

Also Death Eaters such as Malfoy would be pretty active for a long long time, if more discreet and less murderous, but enough to shift the political balance at some point. Especially with how Fudge was corrupt.

** I'd go all mini Tom Riddle on Dumbledore. Dumbles would get many heartattacks, and Quirrelmort would be so very confused. But, for a while, I'd also lay low and work on my magic, knowledge of the wizarding world, gaining followers, and figuring out a way to eventually overthrow the corrupt ministry, just in a more...political way than Voldemort. There was a reason he was defeated, after all. People feared him. I want to be respected and loved as a ruler.

Though, granted, I'd also try to piece Voldemort's soul back together. I wouldn't want to die to kill him. I'd also see if he'd be agreeable to my goals. My reasoning is a pretty solid game changer. And certainly a lot more reasonable than his.

I know I'd have to learn Dark Magic to heal Voldemort, but I wouldn't mind. Dark magic doesn't always seem to hurt people. It could help, but people, especially muggleborns, are too afraid of it.

So, I'll lay low. I'd also kidnap Pettigrew and keep him with me for a bit while I work on getting Sirius out. I'd also befriend Remus, Severus, and my other teachers. They'd help. I'll even meet the Tonks's. I could manipulate them so they'd allow to stay with the over the summer. Though, then again, they'd probably be agreeable anyway. I'd be Sirius's godson, after all.

Of course, I'd have to learn the anti-animagus spell and the obliviate spell to be able to steal Voldemort's wand without Pettigrew remembering my doing anything.

There are a lot of other things I'd do, but for the most part, I'd change the whole game.

**** While I am very smart, and, dare I say, a genius, I still have lots to learn. I just have a higher capacity than most people I've met. (Believe me, if you met the people I knew, you'd be convinced you were a genius) And I also know that, while I am a satisfactory actor, I have a habit of smiling occasionally when I lie or my voice getting higher pitched. It's getting better, sure, but it's why I'd also dedicate my time in learning the mind arts. Both are useful to learn. So my plan would be a long term one.

I wouldn't be able to get everything done in a single year, after all. It would be way too much stress. I'd probably just focus on getting ahead of the rest of the students and then spend my time planning, as well as getting Sirius out of Azkaban. I might even start a newspaper for reliable news---anonymously, of course---but it would take a while. So I'd probably only be able to get Sirius out of Azkaban by the summer after my first year. I'd probably just say I was practising some spells on the rat, and, when I tried the animagus reversal spell, I was shocked to find a grown man and immediately restrained him and took to the ministry---Kingsley Shacklebolt, particularly. He's pretty reliable, and I could see him as an ally in my "grey" side.

Though that's only the early parts of my planning. I'd have a lot of other things to do and consider. Especially considering I would need to make sure that I could get all the horcruxes, not to mention my studies in dark magic. Luckily, I would have the room of requirement, the chamber of secrets, and even the restricted section. I'd also have to explore the school and find all the secret rooms of the founders. Those things would be useful. I'd have to also befriend all the ghosts, especially Helena. They'd be useful.

Actually, now that I think about it, I could renovate Grimmauld place with the help of some newly purchased house-elves. Then I'd be able to stay in it during the summers without Dumbledore being any the wiser. And, considering the wards, I'd be perfectly safe.

And, to get money, I'd just sell muggle supplies and objects at Hogwarts for inflated prices. Of course, I wouldn't give my actual name. I can't have people knowing everything. I could also sell Harry Potter merchandise. I might even be able to employ Fred and George and work with them with all the selling and advertising.

Unfortunately, that would mean that I'd have a very stressful first year with everything to deal with. I probably wouldn't get much sleep, and nevermind quidditch. And I doubt I'd be able to get all of this done in my first year. But I would lay the groundwork for it.

** I would launch a counter propaganda mission amongst the students of Slytherin (if I were in Harry's body I would be sorted according to my own choice I assume) , target the Malfoy scion for extreme empathy exposure (he did want to be Harry's friend I can use that and his high profile introductions) and then convince enough portraits to claim various Muggleborn students as lost heirs to extinct Wizarding family lines, possibly Gringots would be in on that particular scam because when you explain via genetics that everyone is everyone's distant cousin (and split the contents of previously unclaimable vaults with them) they would also vouch for the long lost heir scam. Then when I've broken down the basis for blood prejudice among the youth (it'd take a few more years to get the adults convinced via ministry reform because they were the ones that decided to claim these poor lost Witches and Wizards as something other and less than, shame on them) I'd try to get a counter intelligence program going for accurate real time information on Voldieboys whereabouts because hopefully by year five I'd have him painted not as liberating the Pureblood cause, but as a woefully confused wizard plotting to undermine the magical heritage of a large portion of the population when they are just as capable of magic as the rest.

Truly a lot could be done to sway things toward the entire Muggleborn caste being abolished through the female claim, you could potentially cite Witches through history having their own family lines that were unrecorded because of sexist Ministry policy.

Of course targeting the youth and convincing them to view the students they've othered not only as equals but even fit marriage prospects, in time I would hope to have an entire generation of half blooded genetically diverse Witches and Wizards that would keep claiming that the Muggleborn heritage concept is totally made up by the Ministry to keep control of the population at large by turning them against each other.

It's a very backwards strategy from a real world perspective but the Wizarding elite have proven to be susceptible to anything that plays to their collective vanity.

TL;DR Turn the children against the system and watch it alllll burn. Even if I die I mean I could potentially convince the other children to just mass emigrate to the MACUSA for asylum and Voldemort has no leg to stand on if there aren't any youth to hold over their parents heads.

I'd mention it's weird my parents and the Longbottom family went into hiding. Basically try to get Snape killed year 1. I would uncover Pettigrew and when question ask if there's a spell to check if a animal is real and why all pets aren't registered by the ministry and through Hogwarts for children.

Year 2 after the Pettigrew incident I would have no reason to save Ginny. If the Weasley family hates me after year 1 the save Ginny and make it public who opened the chamber. If Pettigrew is killed year 3 wouldn't happen regardless if Sirius is free or not. Year 4 hopefully convince Crouch Jr that Voldemort is no enemy of mine but Neville doesn't like him. (In the case Voldemort still needs convincing or Crouch wouldn't go rogue) Really any of the champions could be the sacrifice. Year 5 is simply siding with the ministry. Year 6 and 7 are up in the air if Dumbledore knows about the Horcrouxs or not. Dumbledore wouldn't be killed as there is no reason to punish Draco after the ministry fiasco. I'm curious on what Dumbledore would do if he believes that Voldemort would go after me. After year 7 I would simply move to America and transfer any and all money to the American wizarding bank. What's the requirements to get citizenship in wizarding America. I'd do what I can to not be forced into returning to England.

Elf liberation front. Just become completely fixated on that task alone. After all Harry isn't going to be expelled, so the level of protest could probably get pretty extreme before someone really addressed it. Protests could involve all sorts of aspects, the more disruptive the better.

If I have parselmouth, I could go open the chamber of secrets and encourage the basilisk to roam the wilds and the Hogwarts grounds. Not for any purpose, not with any direction.... Or maybe it could be part of the elf Liberation operation.

Play quidditch poorly. Or better yet, play quidditch poorly and argue with everyone that the role of seeker is pointless and that the game is non sensical. This could likely result in some inter house bullying!

Refuse to help Hagrid rehome Norbert. Hagrids house is burnt down, and he's likely fined for having a dragon.

** Hermione dies to the troll because of my overconfidence/butterflies. Riddle drains Ginny's soul before i get to the chamber. accidental basilisk interrupt. social graces harry never had makes befriending Ron nigh impossible, he is simply too unlikeable. difference between real age and physical age makes socialising with peers difficult.

capturing Pettigrew will likely fail, he's a slippery bastard, and fate may be on his side depending on how prophecy works. someone might get bitten by Lupin, might die to dementors, Sirius might die, Snape might die, Buckbeak might die. It all depends on the Patronus charm's actual difficulty.

Cedric beats me to the cup, and either Moody or Cedric are used in the ritual instead, leaving me no possible way to know Voldemort had returned, thus the order is never convened.

Might punch umbridge, or at least hex her, which would get me arrested, or expelled.

can't receive training in Occlumency from Snape because of fear of discovery as an SI, thus can't block out Voldemort's visions. cannot reveal visions either, as it would lead to above mentioned discovery. Arthur Weasley likely dies. Sirius wouldn't be at DOM however, so i wouldn't go. Voldemort never reveals himself to the wizarding world, has unlimited planning time.

Ministry will fall unprepared, Hogwarts will not be prepared, so malfoy's assassination attempts are likely to work, killing dumbledore before he can get more than one horcrux.

Dying to the horcrux hunt is highly likely. Won't be master of death. Voldemort will win final duel. more casualties in final battle. Wizarding world will lose to many families, genetic pool will shrink, purebloods breed themselves out of existence.

If they are somehow around come the turn of the century, CCTV will become too difficult to avoid, their lack of muggle knowledge will see them discovered, and either killed or captured for experimentation. The end.

Casualty list:

Hermione, Ginny, Cedric, Moody, Arthur Weasley, Ron? Dumbledore, Snape, Sirius, Lupin (Executed for murder?) Every Muggleborn. Every halfblood. Every Pureblood. Everyone. Period. and then global warming won't be solved by magic, so all the muggles will die as well.

** Assuming I have good Occlumency and that Veritaserum can be beaten via Obliviation, here's the plan:

First night at Hogwarts, when everyone's asleep, stun Scabbers and force him back into human form. Then, obliviate him - same memories until the train, at which point Pettigrew will remember seeing Harry and deciding to kill him that night, before trying to strangle Harry in his bed and being stopped by accidental magic.

Then, stun him again, make a big noise and when the teachers come, plead ignorance - "I woke up and this man was hurting me and I didn't know what to do then there was a bang and he was unconscious please Professor Dumbledore who was that man and why did he try to hurt me?"

When questioned, Pettigrew will explain the truth of his backstory, along with the extra bits I've added. This guarantees he's punished not only for the Sirius thing but also for attempted murder of Harry Potter. He's also revealed directly to Dumbledore, so good odds he actually gets questioned properly.

Second night, while everyone sleeps, grab a rooster from outside and take it to the Chamber to kill the Basilisk. Now I have anti-Horcrux weapons. Go to the RoR and get the diadem, but don't destroy it. Instead, take it to Dumbledore and spin a yarn - "I couldn't sleep because of what happened last night so I was wandering around and then a teacher came so I found a place to hide, it was filled with weird stuff but I felt a strong pull in one direction, and it was coming from this thing. I thought I'd bring it to you to see why I feel so connected to it."

Dumbledore now has proof of Horcruxes, the DADA curse is neutralised and he also has hints of the connection between Harry's scar and the horcruxes.

When Sirius gets free, you can go to Grimmauld for a visit and "find" the locket via the same method. This gives Dumbles sufficient info to begin looking for the cup as well. If Lucius still gives the Diary to Ginny in 2nd year, you can pretend to sense that too and get it confiscated.

The diary, ring and cup's locations are harder to "stumble on", so you'd have to see how things go with Dumbledore to see if you can pull any tricks or when you could find the time to go after them yourself - but as long as you leave Quirrelmort alone to deal with the mirror and fail, and stop Pettigrew being free, Voldemort is no threat for the forseeable future and gives you lots of time to plan.

** Ok, then, may plan.

If I am to study magic I'm gonna do it well. I would still spend some time socializing with the other kids for people need social interractions to be healthy, but I'd do it as little as I could get away with. This would free a lot of time to study and experiment.

I would spend a lot of time practicing my spells until they become second nature and use a project oriented, hands on studying style. So, find something to do, look up the theory, make it work, make a report, rinse and repeat with something more difficult.

Being the boy who lived, I'd use my status to network and connect with experts of the fields of magic (starting year 6, Slughorn could help tremendeously with this, but I would be getting started far earlier.

As I would now have a lot of money, I'd use it to buy books, potion ingredients and everything else I'd need.

I'd probably wouldn't befriend Ron, nor Hermione (whom I really don't see myself getting along with. I would try to cosy up to the twins, who besides being quite good at magic have a connection to Bill Weasley, who seem worth kowing for someon who intends to get good at magic.

I can't remember if Tonks was still at hogwarts Harry's first year. If she is, convince the wannabe auror to help create a duelling club or something of the sort. Probably no amount of money could convince me to play quidditch. I have better things to do with my time.

Jury's out on leaving the Dursley's.

Then Pettygrew has to go. Too dangerous to keep around. Several ways to do this. I could be innocently working on my animagus revealing spell in the presence of Scabbers and just in front of Dumbledore, for instance. Or I could have "seen" the rat switch to human form by "luck". Barty Crouch Jr, similarly, should be dealt with as early as possible. The other Death Eaters weren't willing or able to seek out ol' Voldie, so it should make things difficult for him.

I'll also use my money to hire private tutors (I do want to learn occlumency/legillimency, and have experienced mentors to help me with my studies).

I do nothing about the stone in first year. Voldie won't beat the mirror anyway, not before Dumbledore is back anyway.

I try to get my hands on Tom's diary year 2. I'm tempted to slip it to Draco along with a compulsion to write in it, but probably not.

​

Which leaves many occasions to mess up.

Most probably, I won't be able to connect with the kids and end up isolated real fast. Even more probably, Voldie will swiftly alter his plans, and there's no way I can compete with one of the most powerful wizards in history standing atop his decades of experience.

I'm bound to attract Dumbledore's attention at one point or another, which could be good or bad.

** I open my eyes and instantly, I know I'm in the wrong place.

And my eyesight's gone to shit.

I find a pair of glasses, and something about the way they're held together wit htape, rings a mental bell faintly.

Within a minute, I've worked out I'm a small boy in a scruffy bedroom.

“Boy, get up and get ready!” yells somebody male, english and angry.

I works out where the bathroom is and wash my face. Oh... I'm Harry Potter.

“Get moving we have to get to london to drop you off” yells the man

“Yes Uncle Vernon” I say as politely as I can.

My uncle Vernon really is very fat and definitely hates me.

My trunk is pulled out from the cupboard under the stairs; I get a quick look inside... I see some childish drawings on the walls. Aunt Petunia is... glad to see the back of me.

I cook them breakfast; I might not be Harry Potter but I can fry rubbish.

Uncle Vernon takes me to London by car; I have no idea about the UK and I'm instantly totally lost.

He turfs me out at Kings Cross station and I put the trunk and Hedgwig on a trolley; It's a bit wonkey but I get to the main platform concourse and take off to platform nine.

I quickly poke my arm through the bricks in a likely looking place and sure enough, there's a magical doorway. I get into platform 9and three quarters and I've got half an hour.

Harry/ I am really weak and I struggle to get the trunk onto the train. I take Hedgwig in her cage to the first empty compartment; and they mostly are this early. There's crowd forming but Harry's on the train and in a compartment, there's no way I'm getting the trunk on the overhead rack.

I open it up and get my wand; up my sleeve and gosh it feels like ... magic holding it.

My arm is warm and I feel like I'm more comfortable than I've ever been.

The standard book of spells comes out, and I close the trunk. After stroking Hedgwig for a bit; she seems to appreciate it. I start trying to learn magic.

The writing's designed for children; so that's easy, but I don't understand any of the concepts and it takes me ages to read the first chapter.

Someone opens the compartment door, I look up

“Hello” I say to some red haired boy who's dragging a trunk. “I'm Harry,”

The boy asks “Can I come in?”

And then when he crumbles to ashes say you didn't mean to kill Dumbledore.

This would most likely get Dumbledore in a boatload of trouble, kicked out of all of his positions, and the Death Eaters start moving and the war starts super early. Meanwhile, since I stole Pettigrew, this gets Sirius a trial and he takes me out of the country with Reemus and the Tonksesseses.

** It's tougher to be in Harry's body but not have any prep time.

My goal is a purge of everyone I dislike in the Wizarding World. I straight up want to slaughter every single Death Eater and kill everyone who shares the same beliefs as Voldemort.

People like Fudge and Umbridge also draw my ire.

Either way, I can skip a lot of plot events by just outing Voldemort by grabbing Quirrel by the face and killing him at the soonest avaliable opporunity. We don't have to waste time with this stupid mystery. Goodbye, Quirrel-mort.

Freeing Sirius is another goal, but I start to question if I shouldn't just kill everyone on the planet.

See, the Harry Potter universe has an afterlife. It's implied to be a good one. The spirits summoned from it are all able to watch what people in the living world do at all times. If the afterlife is a paradise, then there's no good reason for anyone to be alive and suffering. I'd end the pain. Forever.

So one of my priorities would be getting my hands on the Resurrection Stone, bringing a sacrificial pawn to put the ring on and take the curse for me, so I can use the stone to speak to dead people.

I might just end up deciding to kill Peter Pettigrew so no one will revive Voldemort, then wait until after I can break The Trace, then use my invisibility cloak to steal a nuke.

Then I'd apparate around the world, spreading these everywhere by duplicating them. Then I'd set them off, having prepared a floating platform high in the sky for myself.

I'd need to stay alive long enough to ensure that I've made continued life on Earth impossible and that there aren't any survivors.

If he did Harry and Ron's relationship wouldn't work, I don't believe he could resent Harry to that point and then still be friends. A portion of the fourth book yes and the 7th book, 4th year is just friends feuding which happens to all friends during school, it's natural, 7th book is quite obviously the horcrux corrupting Ron. Does Neville not have any friends? Like none in 7 years? His self esteem issues stemmed from his grand mother not because he didn't have friends. He saw himself as a failure and unworthy. He's not socially inept, I know because I suffered from social issues when I was a kid, so no while good friends could help him, it's very much up to him to help himself. Just telling him he's not a failure doesn't help him, it really doesn't.

*** Well you certaintly have a fanon skewed view of Harry Potter don't ya. I also feel you're only a movie watcher, since the books actually have half the shit Hermione did in the movies be from Ron. Also what Molly did asking about the platform number, it's actually something a lot of mothers do to help their kids remember stuff.

I agree about the key thing. In this situation, you are, mature enough to handle your finances(i'm assuming you're an adult here, not some kid). In the book though, it was smart for Dumbledore to hold onto it. Harry just went from 11 year old kid with "dark, and horrible/lonely years(or however that quote goes)." to having enough money that he could live quite comfortably off of it, if he was mature. Which knowing the Psychology of someone like that(which I can actually do with my minors in Psych), he would either be very, very frugal(which can be dangerous), or he'd blow it all since he's a child who doesn't understand how expensive shit like houses, cars, living, etc... is.

Checking for love potions is actually a solid thing you should do. You're the most famous wizard alive, I'm surprised it didn't happen more in the books.

No, Hermione, and Ron are both Harry's truest friends. There were problems(Hermione not telling Harry about going to Mcgonnagal, betraying him. Ron neing stubborn in fourth year about the goblet), but they're children growing up, I guarantee that most kids have had these problems, if less magical.

Freeing Sirius earlier will be difficult, but doable.

Good frigging luck convincing Luna to argue to the sorting hat about her house when she knows jack, and shit about you. Not to mention her unstable mind(which it is, no matter how much fanon like to play fast, and loose with it).

Smashing all the "honeys" is impossoble, but by all means, use your fame to grab all the hot chicks you can. Just don't be surprised if it bites you in the ass.

Asking Hermione, or Luna to the dance is possible now, as long as you've actually cultivated their friendship.

Keeping the Philosophers stone is something that is nigh-impossible to do as an 11 year old Harry. How the hell are you gonna hide it from Dumbledore, and do you even know how it works?

Again, how are you gonna leave the Dursleys when you have Dumbledore "insisting" on it, and are the most famous Wizard since Merlin.

**** I will address every point you have made.

Ron spends half the time slacking off or playing chess. If I am to fight in a war and defeat the dark lord then I need reliable soldiers and true friends. Ron is great I suppose but his jealousy is not something I want to deal with. I would rather have Neville who arguably just needed a better support system to be arguably one of the best in his year. Ron would still be a friend but he would certainly not be one of my best friends.

As to my finances, I am (as far as I know) the last of the potters. I wont have my fortune able to be accessible to a old dude who I dont know.

Freeing Sirius is as simple as researching the spell that reverses the animagus transformation and using it on "scabbers" in the great hall in the presence of albus Dumbledore. Hell I'd go as far as asking Ron to see scabbers for a moment. Ron would probably ask why but not put up much of a fight. Then walking up the the headmaster and using the spell. Boom Peter revealed.

Luna as a first year will probably go along with it if I simply tell her the nargles told me to tell you that you should insist on GRYFFINDOR.

As to the Honeys. A magical castle filled with hormonal teenagers and empty classrooms. You do the math.

The conditions set for the stone to appear are as long as you want to save it but not use it then you can get it. Well all I have to do is want to save it from Voldermorts clutches and not use it at the time then it should appear.

Leaving the Dursleys is simple, hold my wand up and boom knight bus. I have a invisibility cloak that was once possibly used to hide from death itself, and I seem to recall that the protection around the Dursleys states that as long as harry considers it a home than the blood wards would function. But harry arguably considered Hogwarts more of a home so were the protections even active? Also a family as rich as the potters would probably have a few properties right? Grimmuld place is also a option. As I know its location so technically I should be able to get in.

I highly doubt you can trick the mirror to get the stone. It's magic that was cast by Dumbledore, and was giving Voldemort himself trouble. Voldemort didn't want to use it at that time, and he couldn't get it, so I doubt someone with very little magical education such as yourself can.

I think fanon has twisted your perceptions on how easy it is to escape the Dursleys, and how much your underestimating Dumbledore, or overestimating yourself.

That way when Dumbledore goes down there, they're far away from children. I could be wrong though. Also, you still couldn't the stone, since you still want to use it. Sure, later, but you still want to use it.

Yes, it is unlikely she'd forget, but as i've explained already. It's something parents do to help encourage kids to remember. Also, who's saying she's breaking the statue.
