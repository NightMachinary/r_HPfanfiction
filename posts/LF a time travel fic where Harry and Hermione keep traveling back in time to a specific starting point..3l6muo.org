So, just to give a bit more context, this story starts roughly around the beginning of fourth year. At some point they access a device -which is most likely not a time turner- that allows them to go back to the beginning of the year while retaining their memories. So they do, and, day and do new things based on their memories. But that changes things, so, when they get back to the device, they do back again. Then they make more changes, so they go back again. And again and again. Harry and Hermione were the main characters, although I'm not entirely sure they were a pairing. It wasn't completed when I read it, but that doesn't mean it wasn't finished in the meantime. Might be marked as abandoned, might not. I really appreciate any help!

**** Story appears to be abandoned. What there is of it was very good though.

***** Yeah. I was hoping it wasn't, but there wasn't a lot of hope. :(
