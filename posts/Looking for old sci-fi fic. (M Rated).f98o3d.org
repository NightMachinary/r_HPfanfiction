Edit. Solved by RandomBabblings, thanks. "The Star Empire" by RahXephon

So was thinking of sci-fi fics and had an old memory pop up. Cursory searches haven't turned up anything and I think it actually predated my account so no follows or favs. Unfortunately the author was quite liberal with the smut so it might have been deleted but here's what I can remember.

-Harry wakes up on a ship(pirate?) Was sealed/frozen in something maybe crystal. -he was immortal before being frozen. Pretty sure he was a dark lord. -the setting was an original universe where humanity had colonized the solar system, earth was locked down and I think most planets were at war with each other. - I remember at one point harry sneaks onto earth to raid an old stash on Mount Everest or something and a woman steals his eye? - They used Roman numerals to show how powerful something was. Like a mk V railgun vs a Mk IX or something.

That's all I've got sadly minds not quite what it used to be. While the story was decent (lots of sexual violence sadly) I recall being fascinated by the world building and wishing the story had been based on something just so I could find more stories like it. Good luck.


** I believe the fic you're looking for is The Star Empire by RahXephon, but it seems like it's removed from most sites
