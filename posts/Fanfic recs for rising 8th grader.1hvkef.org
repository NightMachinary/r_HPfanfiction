My bf's cousin is going into eighth grade this fall and looking for things to read this summer. She has read the HP books a bunch of times, and likes sci fi. All of my fan fiction reading choices are a bit too old for her, so I'm at a loss. Any suggestions?


** The following are stories that I've let my eleven-year-old son read; none of them sexualizes children or contains much violence (no more so than canon).

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2760303/1/The-Best-Seven-Years][The Best Seven Years]] by blutaiger - Calvin is eighteen and living in England with his folks. Now, he's faced with the task of telling Susie what he's been doing for the past seven years. Novel-length, complete, a Calvin and Hobbes/Harry Potter crossover suitable for readers of that age range.

The [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexander Quick]] series by Inverarity - The war against Voldemort never reached America, but all is not well there. When 11-year-old Alexandra Quick learns she is a witch, she is plunged into a world of prejudices, intrigue, and danger. Who wants Alexandra dead, and why? Five exceptional, complete novels. Added bonus for a female reader: the protagonist of the series is a girl.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1709027/1/The-Awakening-Power][The Awakening Power]] by sib - Challenges fill Harry's 6th year: growing powers, Snape as defense teacher, new Potions teacher, a new crush on him, Voldemort, Ginny, Goblins? Lots of humor, drama, action and romance! H:G,R:Hr. A complete, novel-length story that's basically a 6th year replacement.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6619152/1/Harry-and-the-Hobgoblins][Harry and the Hobgoblins]] by respitechristopher - Harry discovers things far more dangerous and cunning than even the traitorous Sirius Black. One-shot, Harry/Luna, complete.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][Browncoat, Green Eyes]] by nonjon - Firefly: :Harry Potter crossover Post Serenity. Two years have passed since the secret of the planet Miranda got broadcast across the whole 'verse in 2518. The crew of Serenity finally hires a new pilot, but he's a bit peculiar. Novel-length, complete, and hilarious (especially if she likes science fiction and Firefly/Serenity).

*** A minor correction: there are four, not five, exceptional novels in the Alexandra Quick series.

**** Yeah, I forgot that he wrote Hogwarts Houses Divided, a standalone next-generation tale. Thanks for the catch!

** Do you know if she'd prefer something funny or serious or adventurous? If she'd prefer stories closely tied to HP canon or not?

** HP fanfiction aside, she might like the Philip Pullman His Dark Materials trilogy (Golden Compass, Subtle Knife, Amber Spyglass).

And even if she doesn't like the whole trilogy, she'll like the first book, because it's badass.
