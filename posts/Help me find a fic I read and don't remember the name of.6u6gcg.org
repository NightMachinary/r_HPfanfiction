Draco has an arranged marriage with Daphne Greengrass but they don't want to get married so they turn to Hermione for help.

That's all I remember from it hopefully I can find it because it's been bothering me for weeks.

Edit: Thanks to [[/u/ShamayIA][u/ShamayIA]] for finding the fic: Paint Her Black, by PalmettoBlue - [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11495504/1/Paint-Her-Black]]


** Did this also have someone blackmailed, and a game of spin the bottle? Year 7 fic?

*** It was definitely a year 7 fic. It was also a Harmony fic. But I don't remember the game of spin the bottle but it might have happened.
