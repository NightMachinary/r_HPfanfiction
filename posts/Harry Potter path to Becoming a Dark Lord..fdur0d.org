Looking for any harry potter fics where he goes on his own journey similar to Grindelwald, to becoming a dark lord and trying taking over the entire magical world not just England or Europe.

Bonus points if harry has a similar moment to Grindelwald where he getting kick out of Hogwarts in his sixth year and leaves his own ''mark'' on the entrance to the great hall, and swears in front of everyone that this is not the last they will see of him or something along those lines.

Then from there he goes onto travel the world learning and exploring perhaps experimenting and doing some rituals on himself, before going on to start his own war.

Voldemort can be apart of the story or not I don't really mind. But I'm really looking for something about harry's journey to taking over the world.


** We all would love to get a story like that, but I haven't found anything cloae. I have some stories in my PC that I can share later today.

** The closest I can think of would be something like /Equal and Opposite/ by Amerision (not linking for certain reasons). Much of that is off screen, but he does some pretty terrible stuff at Hogwarts and literally leaves the world to escape (it makes more sense in context).

** Linkao3(690093) Linkao3(6334630) Both are amazing. Easy as falling is first of a completed 4-part.

  Harry doesn't really like the way things are going in the wizarding world. But who's going to do something about it?...Him, that's who! (Or, how Harry became a Benevolently Snarky Dark Lord).

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

*** I was quite interested in Easy as Falling until I saw that it's slash. Nothing against that, I just don't enjoy reading it.

***** No worries, after a few hundred different fics in the same universe it can be hard to remember which was which at times. At least I know I run into that issue myself.
