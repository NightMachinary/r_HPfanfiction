I'd prefer them to be one-shots between 1,000 and 30,000 words, though if you've got multi-chapter fics more than that that you think are perfect, please recommend them! Also, if there are any fics where someone else, say the Weasleys find out, I'd be cool with that, too!

I'm kinda looking for fics where Harry's got scars or he flinches or whatever.

I'm in the mood for some real hurt so thanks for any recs!


** A great one is A Second Chance by breanie - it's a pretty long one and still being updated. Chapter 6 is where Sirius find out if you want to read a bit and see if it's a good fit.

It's my absolute favorite The character development is incredible and I've become so attached. It also has quite a bit of smut and is for mature audiences.

** linkao3(23168287) Disguised as Something Else. One of my absolute favorites.

linkao3(11656536) Listen

linkao3(20403091) Bruised Hearts and Painted Skin

linkao3(16606907) Bottle It Up. Part 1 doesn't involve Sirius/Remus, but part 2 is about Sirius and Harry's disability. Part 1 deserves an award for a Snape characterization that makes some iota of sense on the dislikeable/functional teacher spectrum.

linkao3(22581145) Boy

linkao3(24086086) Seven Plus One. Stations of canony, but decent.

linkao3(25680613) Pinky Promise

linkao3(20468282) Harry Potter And The Summer At Grimmauld Place

  “I used to sleep there,” Harry snaps.He's breathing hard. He feels like he's run a marathon, even though he's just sitting there uselessly, staring at a perfectly ordinary cupboard.“What?” Sirius says.(For the Bad Things Happen Bingo, prompt: Childhood Trauma).

  Sirius broke out of Azkaban with the intention of hunting down Wormtail. He stops by Surrey just to take a quick look at Harry. Just a glimpse to see if he's okay. He won't stop, he won't talk to him... Then Vernon Dursley wraps his hands around Harry's throat and any plan he had is out the window. But Remus will help. Sirius has Harry, he has a way to make Remus listen. He has to...

  His aunt and uncle, by virtue of necessity, had let it be known that Harry was disabled (it was hard to hide an ambulance showing up in the middle of the night, and Harry's teachers had needed to know anyway) but they had made it very clear: Harry's condition was disgusting and shameful. Harry was disgusting and shameful.  Or, the one where Harry learns that he doesn't have to go it alone.

  Remus Lupin was an observant professor. He knew how it felt to be ignored, so he gave special care to pay attention to his students---not only in regards to their studies, but to their mental health, too.Remus Lupin was the first person to notice what Harry was hiding, and he was the first adult to care enough to do something about it.

  Post Prisoner of Azkaban, Sirius chooses to hide in plain sight in order to have Harry with him for the summer instead forcing him to go back to the Dursleys. Of course Sirius loved Harry as well. Had from the moment Lily and James had told him they were expecting and hundred times more still when Lily had placed a small, snuffling bundle into his arms. The problem was that he'd never expected to really do anything else except love the kid. Maybe teach him some broom tricks and spoil him rotten. But whilst those things were still in the offing, there was now also so much more.
