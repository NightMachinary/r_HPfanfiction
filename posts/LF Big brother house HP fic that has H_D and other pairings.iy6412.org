:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
The story is pretty old and I don't remember where it came from originally (either FF.net or a partner website.) I vaguely recall that someone (not mpreg) got pregnant at the end of the fic among other things. Harry or Draco had a talk with said pregnant woman. Harry/Draco wasn't established in the fic at first and there was several pairings present. The plot was like a Big Brother house style reality tv show with HP characters getting voted off.

Edit: Sorry about not being clear about the pairing. It was yaoi with straight couples, with Harry/Draco being the main one but also had other side pairings. I can't recall all of the pairings but the endgame was Harry/Draco and someone (either Hermoine or another woman) was pregnant at the end of the fic when everyone was voted off.


** By H/D do you mean Harry/Draco, Harry/Daphne, Harry/Dumbledore, Harry/Delores Umbridge, Harry/Dementor, Harry/Dobby, Harry/Death?

  A new show on the Wizarding Wireless Network launches 5 years after the final battle. It will place 10 'celebrities' in a house together for 2 months. Friendships and romances will blossom, but rivalries threaten to rip them apart. Who will win 'Listen-In' and the prize of a thousand galleons that comes with it? AU post-DH, Rated M for language, sexual and sensitive themes.
