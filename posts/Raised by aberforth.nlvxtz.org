Dumbledore would certainly trust him, his own brother, and he would be close enough to Hogwarts to visit him as well. If no one writes it or recommends something just like this I might write it.


** I believe it would be an incredibly interesting story, one that could explore the creation of a Harry who has no relatives or godfather magics and is stupidly rich and lives in a mansion or castle.

It could exploit Aberforth himself so much - which I believe to be a character with immense potential and who is often underestimated and treated as irrelevant, to the point that most stories don't even mention him - and his parenting skills, which although probably rusty, must still be exist, since it is strongly implicated in the Canon that he took care of Ariana practically alone after his mother's death.

In the brief glimpse we see of him in Deathly Hallows, Aberforth looks like a bitter, rude and bold old man, but also a skilled and powerful wizard - he is one of Albus Dumbledore's brothers, after all - and has chosen to fight the Death Eaters, despite of his continuing resentment towards his brother. I think it helps him with the Battle of Hogwarts, more than anything, speaks a lot about Aberforth's morals and personality than the way he talks to people.

It would also be interesting to see the dynamics between Albus Dumbledore, wizard super-grandfather, mega-director and renowned politician, and his brother felt Aberforth, apparently with similar talent, but rude, resentful and determined to live alone and content with his bar. I could explore their relationship more deeply, the past of Dumbledore, Aberforth, Ariana and Grindelwald. It could even include a half reconciliation between them, since baby Harry, all adorable and chaotic, would certainly bring them together.

PS: Is it just me who imagined a mini-Harry with crooked glasses, a scowling expression and a penetrating look sitting behind the Boar Head counter looking ugly at customers, following Aberforth's example? Or the strange and suspicious clientele of the bar coming back over and over again, why was Harry so adorable that they wanted to see him again?

** While interesting, I don't think a bitter old barkeeper of one of the fishiest bars in hogsmeade is a suitable guardian for a baby. On the other hand: he can't be worse than the Dursleys.

**** If you mean Second String: It's really slow paced in the beginning, but it's one of the most unique timetravel fics out there and while the plot is a little bit slow it has great world and character-building. And the twist in the end is great.

*** Hmm. I'm not sure if I can do a long one currently, I'm working on a sci-fi AU I've wanted to do for a while now. I might do a smaller one-shot though.

** There is a fic where Harry is sent back in time via dementors I believe. He ends up living and working for Aberforth. Really good story but I can't for the life of me remember what it is called.
