I can't find this fic no matter how hard I search. Harry does some sort of ritual to send him back in time. He raises baby Harry. Sets Sirius free and lives with Sirius and Remus. I think he might have gotten married at one point to a muggle(?). It's not a super long fic and I can't remember if it's complete or not.

I remember one specific part where Old Harry Transfigures Umbridge into a flower pot (or maybe a teapot?) and stores her in a storage vortex/bag/something for a long time.

  Rita spouting lies, branded as a Dark wizard and goblins in a rage; Harry's had enough. So, he seeks to jump back in time to save himself from a life of misery and fickle loyalty, maybe a little revenge and mysteries along the way.Time Travel! A Harry raises himself fic. Non-epilogue compliant, non-slash.
