I love Luna Lovegood, she is one of my top 10 favorite characters in the Harry Potter books. It always saddens me when people don't understand her character, or cheapen her character to be a Seer.

She is pretty much the exact opposite of Hermione Granger. Hermione is for the rules, she believes in books and authority (until they go against something she believes is right). Luna on the other hand, has that childlike, of always questioning anything and everything, even authority.

Hermione, whenever she wants an answer to a question, looks it up in a book, Luna searches it for herself.

Hermione isn't very emotional tactful. For instance when Lavender's rabbit died, instead of comforting her, Hermione "pretty much" told Lavender she was silly for thinking it was because of the prophecy that Trelawney made, that her rabbit died. Sure, logically thinking, it is silly of Lavender to think that's why/how her rabbit died, but her pet just died, you don't tell anyone that, you comfort them. She also goes against her friends (admittedly for good reason), because she fears that Harry's brand new broom was jinxed by Sirius.

Luna on the other hand, is the first person to be able to comfort Harry, after Sirius' death, she's able to see through his Polyjuice Potion at the party. She ignores the bullies, and instead goes looking for her shoes and other missing things on her own, Hermione runs into the bathroom after hearing Ron say mean things.

Not saying either one is right or wrong, everyone is different after all, and everyone experiences things and handles things differently, merely pointing out how different both characters are.

Luna is more feeling, she questions things, that childlike wonder of never ending questions. Why, what, who, where, when, et cetra. While Hermione searches through a book, Luna searches through her interactions with people, and exploring the world when she wants to find her magical creatures.


** It hit me that Luna may be the only 'emotionally tactful' person in hp

** I've said it before, and I'll say it again: someone should write a buddy-cop comedy/adventure starring Hermione and Luna. I imagine it taking place after they both go to work for the Department of Registration and Control of Magical Creatures after DH. Due to the war, the department is very short-staffed, and so they get put on---or rather they become---the taskforce in charge of handling Lovecratfian horrors, Muggle cults seeking to resurrect ancient gods, and similar nuisances.

--------------

That said, I don't quite buy the characterisations in the OP.

Luna does have a sense of child-like wonder about her, but it manifests not in her asking questions and seeking and testing answers but rather in endless convoluted speculation. As [[/u/Hellstrike]] pointed out, a Muggle!Luna would be a hippy girl who hasn't met a conspiracy theory she didn't like. Whether the Bilderberg Group, the moon landing, 5G, 9/11, vaccines, fluoridation, GMOs, "western" medicine, or whatever alternative medicine modality she liked, she'd have a lot of profoundly uninformed but utterly immovable opinions about it---and very little interest in actually learning the usually far more pedestrian reality behind the myth. She'd question every official authority---but take as authoritative the most recent YouTube video she saw. Magic may change specific facts of what is true and what is not, but Magical!Luna's approach to truth is only slightly less bad in the magic world than Muggle!Luna's would have been IRL.

I do agree with the OP about emotions. This uncritical, nonjudgmental, somewhat platitudinous, Polyanna attitude enables Luna to shrug off offence and bullying, as well as being able to comfort someone---to simply be there and listen. In contrast, early-canon Hermione is profoundly bad at all those things. She's the sort of person to either ignore another's (and her own) suffering as irrational or immediately jump in with advice on how to solve what she thinks is the underlying problem. (Her crying in the toilets on Halloween stems directly from this: Hermione had actually thought that they were friends, and hectoring and unsolicited advice about staying out of trouble and casting spells is how early-canon Hermione expresses friendship. Ron's words showed her that all this time, she has actually been antagonising him---and she had no idea how to even begin to solve that problem, which broke her.)

Late-canon Hermione is better at empathising and understanding people (including house-elves), but she is still not very good at expressing this empathy and understanding. We can see that in her interactions with Kreacher in DH.

Similarly, Hermione's rules and authority thing only looks like a character-defining trait in comparison to Harry and Ron, who are both pathologically incapable of considering the consequences of their actions. But, if she thinks that breaking a rule is a good idea, then she'll do it and do her best to get away with it.

I'd also say that looking up answers in a book is, in fact, almost always the best way to get a good answer---especially if you have the diligence to consider several sources and critically analyse them, which Hermione often does. This is because nobody can be an expert in everything, and the the sort of "searching for yourself" that Luna does is a great way to end up with a head full of rubbish.

Have we read the same books? She had a bad case of teenage stupidity in HBP, as did everyone else, but calling the woman who, at one point, was one of the two people still fighting for the good cause in a hopeless situation a baby does her a gross disservice. Tactless I'd get, cruel/ruthless even (Umbridge's fate in the forest anyone?), but a baby? Pretty much everyone else is better described with that term.

**** Sorry yes I like her in the books but when she's in fan fiction she's not the brave smart women who fought by his side instead she's a little girl who cries all the time and I just don't like it.

** Unfortunately, Luna does not work as a main character since you'd have to take away her Lunaness in order to make her somewhat sane. Because in canon she's basically one of those 5G Corona, Nazi Moonbase, Lizard people run the government type of people. Which is great for comic relief, but would annoy everyone after 5 minutes.
