Inspired by the recent post about Willy Wonka and his violations of the Statute of Secrecy.

In the summer of 1971 Willy Wonka sent out Golden Tickets into the world, seeking an heir to take over his candy business. Not only the mundane chocolate bars that he released in the muggle world though, but the magical factory populated by strange creatures that produced fantastical confectionery for the magical world. The tickets, charmed to be discoverable only by 11 year old muggleborn/muggle-raised went out into the world and were found one by one, until the last one was found by a poor boy from London, Severus Snape.

A fic in which Severus Snape becomes heir to the Wonka chocolate empire, puts his potion making talent to use creating fantastical candy, and becomes a far less serious person under the mentorship of Wonka, who is very interested in rekindling a friendship with former classmate Eileen Prince.
