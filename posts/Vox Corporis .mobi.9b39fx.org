So I'm new to the HP Fan Fiction train having only read Methods of Rationality (twice) on recommendation from a friend. I've since been looking for a new Fan Fic and have come across a few that I've loaded up to my Kindle however one that caught my eye is Vox Corporis. Does anyone have a .mobi link for this so I can put it on my Kindle? The [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] version seemed to have been taken down a long while ago.

â€‹

For anyone wondering the others I am going to try are A Long Journey Home, The Pureblood Pretense and The Seventh Horcrux.
