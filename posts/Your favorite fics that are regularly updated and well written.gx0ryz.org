I saw someone comment on this subreddit that they follow a lot of fics that are regularly updated, so that they get a newly updated chapter to read everyday.

So please share the WIPs that you are currently following.

Here are some of the fics that I follow: linkffn!(10629488) linkffn!(12713828) linkffn!(11191235)


** My main follows include:

- Intensity, book 5 of the linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) series. Sirius escaped from Azkaban early and offered Harry another home (while still hiding from the law). Does a great job fleshing out Sirius and various other characters, and it's really sweet to see Harry getting a childhood and a loving home (albeit with baggage).

- linkffn(What's Her Name in Hufflepuff), a light-hearted and funny self-insert story where the main character mostly ignores canon to go off and have fun with magical nail polish and boy bands (she does do her bit to make Voldemort's return harder, but that's hardly a full time job).

- linkffn(The Impostor Complex), where the Diary horcrux had enough of Ginny's soul saved up to survive for a short time after the Diary's destruction, and managed to possess another host. However, upon learning more about the state of the world, this younger version of Tom is dismayed to learn about the destructiveness and insanity of his original self, and resolves to bring him down. Note that Diary!Tom is still not much of a nice guy, he just has higher standards than the madman who thought it was a good idea to put his soul in well-known and easily recognisable artifacts.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

  Tom Riddle escapes at the end of Chamber of Secrets, and is quite surprised to find that nothing about the future is as he ever thought it would be. Soon, Tom finds himself on a globe-spanning quest to follow the path his forebear blazed and perhaps, at the end, to put a stop to him once and for all.

  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means.

  The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
