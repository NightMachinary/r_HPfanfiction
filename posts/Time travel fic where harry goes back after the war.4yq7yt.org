I know there are many time travel fics, but ones I'm looking for in particular are where the war ends, and regardless of whether Harry won or lost, everyone else is gone. So he goes back to first year. I'm specifically looking for fics where he pursues Ginny earlier than in the original series since he knows he winds up with her. I've read Backwards with a Purpose, which somewhat fits my request.


** I think you would like *Ginny Returns*, linkffn(4740107). Instead of Harry losing everyone and going back, it's Ginny losing everything and going back in desperation. This fic is probably the only one that has Ginny as the lone time traveller and is still finished.

Then there is the *Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past*, linkffn(2636963), the highest favorited fic on ff.net. But unfortunately, I doubt this fic will ever be finished.

*Strawberry Fields*, linkffn(4940094), is one of those 'characters read the Books' fics, so it's kind equivalent to time travels. This fic is only a one-shot, but a fun read.

*We are the Golden Trio!*, linkffn(7405516), has the Trio and a 5 days old Rose accidentally thrown back to their first year. They ran their ops covertly, got Ginny (10 years old, not a time traveller) on board early, and generally kicked asses around.

**** Thanks for the recommendations. I am hesitant to start nightmares since it is unfinished. Ginny Returns is closer to what I'm looking for though I'd still prefer a story from Harry's perspective.

** I love Oh God, Not Again. The author says it's a parody but it's not a crack fic and I really liked it. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/]]

*** Well not so much that but rather I like the idea that in the original series, Harry doesn't even notice Ginny till he is turning 16, but in this case he'd know in his first year that he liked her. How would that play out since Ginny couldn't even talk to him her first three years of school.
