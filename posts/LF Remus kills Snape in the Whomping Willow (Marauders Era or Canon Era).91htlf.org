Would Lupin have gotten away with it? There are rumors of werewolves in the Forest, and it could be blamed on them. I'm actually more interested in how this would affect the group chemistry as a whole. I think Sirius would definitely be kicked out, James would feel really guilty, Peter might get closer because Sirius is gone and not betray them, and Remus would have developed a complex. Lily... eh.


** Correct me if I'm wrong but wasn't that rumour stated because Remus would often wonder the Forrest while transformed with the other marauders?

*** No that is actually caused by wolf cubs that came from two werewolves pairing during the full moon being released in the forest

**** Officially he was /supposed/ to be in the Shrieking Shack, and he's directly the cause of those rumors, but the whole point with the Marauders is that they'd let him wander the Forest while supervising him instead of letting him stay in the Shack.

**** From what I remember.

Remus gets inside the shack to transform..then his friends after learning to become animagus, release him for the night.

So, Remus doesn't scratch or bite himself as Moony.

Then when the night is almost over, they get him back to the shaft and make it like Remus never came out.

Hence Technically, both of you are correct, I guess.

Though on that note, I don't think James and the band never called themselves Marauders in canon. Can someone confirm this?

** I know of two stories. But have not kept the links, or the links are in my mess of a bookmark folder waiting to be sorted through.

One where Snape ends up as a ghost in the Shrieking Shack and Dumbledore keeps what happened a secret. Rest of canon happens, with Peter being the one who reveals the prophesy to Voldemort. Harry meets and befriends Snape when he gets to Hogwarts. It was on ff.net, think it was called something so simple as 'Ghost'.

The second was on fictionalley, I think. It was Dumbledore introspective of what happened to the boys after Snape was killed. Remus ended up in Azkaban, James and Sirius stopped being friends, though I think he stayed in school.

*** Based on some Google searching, I think the first one you mention [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1691900/1/Ghosts][is called Ghosts.]] Is that the one?

**** That is it. Although I seem to have blocked out the SS/HP angle. Probably the reason why I didn't save the story.

*** I hope someone recognizes the second fic because that sounds very interesting and I would love to read it.

Edit: Fuck it. Can't find it. Did find some somewhat similar stories though.\\

**** I'm pretty sure it's deleted and that's why I don't have the link anymore. I know I had it bookmarked on delicious years and years ago.

Edit: Never mind. It wad livejournal and it's purged. Also,delicious kind of sort of works now. But not really.
