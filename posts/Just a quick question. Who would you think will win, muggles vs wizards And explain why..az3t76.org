Perhaps I'm just being naive, but is the /correct/ response to inbound nukes to make your own outbound?

It's like if... some serial killer came to your home and murdered your family and your response was to go to /their/ house and kill /their/ family. Perhaps if the entire world agreed, "If you kill my family, I'm going to kill yours!" there would be less serial killers killing people's families on the whole. But in the case that a serial killer /does/ kill your family, is it /right/, once your family is dead, to deprive innocent people of their lives in what amounts to revenge?

MAD seems like one of those things I'm glad exists because it's /prevented/ nuclear fallout but one that I'm not sure I'd be comfortable with actually being enacted. Sure, it'd be easy to blame, say, Kim Jung-un for firing the first nuke, but killing an /entire nation/ in retaliation just... doesn't seem like it's going to solve anything other than killing a bunch of /other/ innocent people.

EDIT: To clarify, I'm wondering if the world agreeing to kill each other in retaliation is a /good/ thing, but /actually doing it/ is the wrong thing. Sure, maybe North Korea or Russia or whoever "wins" because we didn't. But at least /humanity/ isn't extinct and why do we care, after we're dead, who won anyways?

** That all rather depends on how the war begins. If the Wizarding World are the assailants, and they all act as one rather than squabbling among themselves, (that's a pretty big IF for the record), the magicals would definitely win. /Imperius/ and Memory-Charms are an unspeakably great advantage in this situation. A worldwide conspiracy of wizards could take control of all Muggle leaders and their military within a day, with sufficient coordination.

If the wizards don't get the drop on the Muggles, it's less clear. One-on-one, wizarding weapons can foil most Muggle weapons --- a Shield Charm /definitely/ protects against bullets, and I'm of a mind that a well-cast one would protect from any manner of bomb, up to and including nuclear. And biological warfare or gas attacks are useless considering Wizarding Healing. /But/ this is all theoretical: the Muggles have the very great advantage that the Wizards have a really feeble idea of what they're capable of.

The Wizarding side is also heavily reliant on a few key people, in a way the Muggles really aren't. Take out Dumbledore, Grindelwald and Voldemort alone, and the Wizarding World loses its biggest assets in one fell swoop, and they can't just replace them on a whim. So if any Muggle art wins the war, it'll be assassination.

No, there there's a canonical answer that goes your way. This is the reason wizards need to get the drop on Muggles to win: it's much faster to fire a gun than it is to cast a Shield Charm.

It's not something in their DNA --- it's that a magical immune system fixes all non-magical diseases without breaking a sweat.

Wizards might use memory charms etc to manipulate the leaders of the muggle world? Well, once the war begins, muggle leaders are going to be hiding in fortified bunkers with dozens of guards.

It would be a draw. In the initial stages, the wizards have the advantage since muggleborns know about muggles while muggles know nothin'.

However, if the wizards change to guerilla tactics, it would be nearly impossible to eradicate them.

In comparison, Theresa May gives Putin a call. “Let's attack Wizarding France.” “Sure. “ Within 15 minutes, both sides would have already scrambled a squadron of fighter jets each. Within 4 hours, both countries would have a battalion-sized force ready.

Edit: Also, you don't need to see something to hit it. You can fire artillery by aiming at a "hole" in the map.

That's not it at all. It's just that their inherent magic fights off most common Muggle illnesses to perfection, and they have potions and Healing Spells for anything more serious. Wizards do get the occasional disease, but never a Muggle cold --- there are magical germs which have evolved precisely for the purpose of infecting magical beings. Dragon pox is the most often talked-about one in the books, there are others. The same goes for injuries, too; magic can repair any mundane damage short of stuff that actually kills you. It's only when the wounds were the product of Dark Magic that it starts becoming harder to undo (hence Moody's scars).

** Wizards, no contest. While not all of them are exactly well informed about muggle technology and such, there has to be some group that knows whats up.

The only trump card the muggles have are nukes. And those are useless since the greatest concentrations of wizards are often around the greatest concentration of muggles. London, New York, Paris,...

Beyond that wizards outclass muggles in almost everything imaginable. Maneuverability, Logistics, Intel and Information, sheer destructive force,... the only thing they lack is numbers. However, since every single wizard has in their possession a force multiplier, even just a handful of them could potentially wipe out entire nations. Lets take Fiendfyre for example. One spell, cast by one wizard, that will destroy as long as it finds anything to devour. Billions of muggles could die by the hands of a few wizards.

And that doesn't even delve into the absolute mayhem wizards could invoke in any chain of command by the use of the simplest spells. Obliviate and Confundus are extremely dangerous weapons. What if Platoon Lead forgets the objective? What if the Artillery is confunded on the designated target coordinates? If we go to heavy hitting stuff, Imperio grants you the possibility of having as many traitorous generals and admirals as you want.

Any material brought into battle by the muggles can be transfigured or vanished, let alone blown to shreds because armor class means literally nothing to a spell designed to destroy. Bullets won't find their targets because the robes worn are simply enchanted against bullets and projectiles of any kind.

And so on and so forth... There is no win-scenario for the muggles unless you severely nerf wizards and heap entire decks of idiot cards on them (as some fics have done in the past).

edit: And of course, consider this: Why would the wizards fight in the first place, if they can simply Obliviate, Imperio and Confund the muggles into forgetting they're angry at the wizards?

I'll aslo add that the only winning condition for muggles against wizards are other wizards. If muggles can recruit enough muggleborn wizards, then they might have a lick of a chance. But then its not Muggles vs. Wizards, its Wizards with gun people vs. Wizards without gun people.

And frankly, no we don't know that wizards are dumber than muggles. Nothing in the HP franchise would suggest they're in any way smarter or dumber. The mental capabilities of both wizards and muggles seem to be the same in the universe.

Charm the barrel to have a bend. Its main gun is now useless. And who is to say the tank could withstand a Reducto?

From canon:

#+begin_quote
  With this powerful curse, skilled wizards can easily reduce obstacles to pieces.For obvious reasons great care must be exercised when learning and practising this spell, lest you find yourself sweeping up in detention for it is all too easy to bring your classroom ceiling crashing down, or to reduce your teacher's desk to a fine mist.
#+end_quote

The limit of the spell is not reached at some point of armor. Its condition for destruction into "fine mist" is something being a solid object. A tank is a solid object.

3) I already agreed. When it comes to communication /technology/, the muggles are better than wizards by a long shot. However: We already know that wizards are intertwined with muggle government and have leeway in how to manipulate it. If the US President gets a call from the Russian one, chances are the wizards know.

4) They are not only police. Aurors are highly trained elite units of the Departments of Magical Law enforcement. They are well versed in very destructive magic - even the Unforgiveables. And would you say that someone like Moody is not trained to kill? They usually don't kill, because their goal is arrests, but they are more than capable of it.

5) And what keeps wizards from knowing the location of these bunkers, if they already sit so close to the Prime Minister, the US President and probably a hundred other vital locations? And if they don't know for some reason, what keeps them from just taking that intel from the people fighting the battles? There is nothing keeping them from ripping every vital information out of a Major's mind.

6) If I cast Fiendfyre on say, Beijing, it will burn its way all across the Eurasian continent until it reaches the portugese coast and maybe even devastate Africa. Why? Because there is literally nothing the muggles can do. Water doesn't do anything against it. Suffocation does nothing. Only magic can tame Fiendfyre. As a hypothetical. Wizards can deploy actual mind control. A war of destruction is not even something they would want to have to win.

And even /if/ magic was inferior to these things, why shouldn't wizards just get their own muggle army by Imperio and other fun spells, if their weapons are so great?

3) Possible, of course. But the Prime Minister, for example, didn't know his secretary Shacklebolt was a wizard until told so. Maybe thats an indication as to why such a manipulation would be exceedingly hard to pull off.

4) I'm not sure if you are A) aware how little training a grunt soldier actually gets, B) How militarized a police force can be.

Aurors are the equivalent of the GSG9, the GIGN, the Cobra. They are /technically/ a police force, but they are trained to deal with threats of extreme danger. In terms of training they easily outrank a simple US Marine, or Army recruit. They are trained to kill highly dangerous dark wizards.

5) How do you hide bunkers large enough? And how do you hide the departure of, say, the US President from his closest secretary? You'd probably even take the secretary (who is a wizard) with you into the bunker.

Spies don't exchange information. Its a one-way road of information. Just like with Shacklebolt as Secretary to the Prime Minister, chances are the Presidents wouldn't even know of a wizard in their staff.

But even if they knew the locations, they could A) not see them probably, and B) can't do anything because most of them are within muggle areas.

6) Its the spell Crabbe used in the Room of Requirement during the battle of Hogwarts. Its not just white phosporus levels of dangerous. Its way beyond that. Even people like Dumbledore have a healthy fear of even using the spell.

From the book:

Now the fire was mutating, forming a gigantic pack of fiery beasts: Flaming serpents, chimaeras, and dragons rose and fell and rose again, and the detritus of centuries on which they were feeding was thrown up in the air into their fanged mouths, tossed high on clawed feet, before being consumed by the inferno."

******* What do you have to say about this (not my reply but was directed at me to answer)

As the battle prolongs, the wizards lose their advantage of having superior knowledge. Many of the commenters here seem to have no idea how the military works. I'm currently serving and have seen first hand how scary an organised military can be. Attack Gringotts and Wizarding Britain falls. Goblin guards? Send an infantry battalion. Dragon? Send an armour battalion. Protective charms and wards? Send an artillery battalion. Boom. Gringotts is gone.

Wizards might use memory charms etc to manipulate the leaders of the muggle world? Well, once the war begins, muggle leaders are going to be hiding in fortified bunkers with dozens of guards.

It would be a draw. In the initial stages, the wizards have the advantage since muggleborns know about muggles while muggles know nothin'. However, sooner or later, the muggles will get their hands on at least a few wizards. And we know, how efficient the CIA's torture methods are.

However, if the wizards change to guerilla tactics, it would be nearly impossible to eradicate them. Invisibility cloaks, disillusion, muggle-repelling wards etc would make the survivors extremely hard to find. Hence, a draw seems most likely. As for a one-to-one fight between a wizard and a muggle? A wizard would win. However, a muggle soldier vs an Auror? Aurors and Wizards are not trained to kill. Muggle soldiers are. And muggle military personnel alone are probably superior in numbers compared to the entire wizarding world. However, if the wizards change to guerilla tactics, it would be nearly impossible to eradicate them. Invisibility cloaks, disillusion, muggle-repelling wards etc would make the survivors extremely hard to find. Hence, a draw seems most likely. And I almost forgot another key factor - speed. Let's say Wizarding Britain and Wizarding Bulgaria decide to attack muggle France. Fudge sends a message by owl. The owl would take several days to travel to Bulgaria.

In comparison, Theresa May gives Putin a call. “Let's attack Wizarding France.” “Sure. “ Within 15 minutes, both sides would have already scrambled a squadron of fighter jets each. Within 4 hours, both countries would have a battalion-sized force ready.

Edit: Also, you don't need to see something to hit it. You can fire artillery by aiming at a "hole" in the map. And again, good luck hitting tactical nuclear warheads as they come at you at supersonic speeds. An ICBM warhead has a terminal velocity of several thousand meters per second. Good luck hitting that with a spell, nevermind multiple warheads carried by one missile. Also, you'd need to track down all missile submarines before they can launch, and again, good luck with that.

That's why it's completely stupid and total wizard wank if someone thinks they could be intercepted by some spells in the flight. The obvious counter to that are SSBNs. Good luck finding every single missile submarine with standing orders to launch should their country fall. Each is capable of turning earth into a nuclear wasteland. Especially the Russian Typhoons, which have the same displacement as a treaty battleship.

It's nearly impossible for the navies which do that for a living, nevermind wizards whose experts are too stupid to consider buying a book to answer the question "what are rubber ducks for".

Shacklebolt was as close a staff member of the Prime Minister as you can be during war time. Chances are /some/ president at least will have a wizarding secretary with him. Security is breached immediately.

********** Okay, I'll keep at it because its fun to imagine how easily wizards could deal with everything you say.

1) The Goblins could just reopen a lobby for their bank in their caverns and have Floo connections to it. Just because the main entrance is blocked by a tank doesn't mean business as usual cannot be conducted in some other way. Thats /assuming/ the siege would even be able to withstand the first countermeasures.

And even if, by some miracle, the muggles manage to cut the wizard economy, then so what? Wizards are /extremely/ self sufficient. They could survive years without access to their vaults. Not to mention that they could just turn around and get the essentials from any source in the muggle world.

2) */The only/* win condition for muggles are muggleborns. If muggleborns in great numbers join the muggle forces, then all discussion led here is null, because its no longer a muggle vs. wizard war, its a wizard vs. wizard war. We would have to have an entirely different discussion about such a war.

3) I say again: We know that they could /easily/ manipulate the US President in forgetting a call with the UK Prime Minister because it was convenient for the wizards. Thats indication enough to assume there are some very easy ways of getting to the highest ranking politicians of a nation at the wizard's leisure. Granted, that is in peace times, but it already is a glaring hole in security.

4) Wizards will never join a direct battle. Never. Even if they could shield against bullets and rockets, why should they in the first place? Their involuntary spies will be numerous. You couldn't even trust your best buddy, your majors - anyone. Everybody could be a spy with close to no indication of them being one.

5) Magic. Even with a simple Wingardium Leviosa a wizard could easily disrupt a IFV supported patrol with ease, to the point of the patrol being absolutely stuck in place. And all it takes is one apparition under an invisibility cloak, one spell, and another apparition. We're not talking about minutes to /hours/ that an ambush in the Vietnamese jungles took. We are talking /seconds/. Soldiers would barely be able to identify the direction of the spell (if it even has a projectile to see in the first place) when the wizard already apparates away. Their salvos of machine gun fire would go into empty space.

6) The Aurors were famously given free use of the Unforgiveables during the first Voldemort War. They were ordered to kill or capture Death Eaters. Moody, for example, was cited doing so until he reached infamy among his enemies and allies. The british Aurors are responsible for killing most of the giants in Britain during the first war.

[[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/thing/ministry-of-magic/department-of-magical-law-enforcement/auror-headquarters/aurors/]]

They are not soldiers, that much is right. Their first reaction is not going to be to pull a trigger / speak a lethal spell. But while it may not be their first instinct, they are very much capable of killing.

Not to mention that wizards, again, would already have commited a plethora of mistakes if they ever find themselves in a direct 1 vs 1 situation against a muggle soldier.

And we're still only talking about law abiding Aurors. What if we just release the full power of Death Eater like types upon the muggle population? No more qualms, no more restraint. You think someone like Bellatrix Lestrange would give one shit about any such thing as a Geneva Convention?

7) Yes, I have repeadetly agreed that muggle communication is faster and more effective. My point was that wizard communication does not take days when its urgent.

8) What about "Completely true" didn't you understand? Yes, his point stands. I'm just pointing out the consequences of his point.

9) Then not a nuke. Clarify what type of weapon we're talking about. The MOAB? Rocket Artillery? The Tomahawk? And also be aware that once you go down from a nuke, effectiveness decreases rapidly. And clarify how these weapons would be effective in an area that also has muggle citizens living in it. Do you just throw a MOAB at them and call it a win if you kill wizards and muggles at a 1/10 ratio?

But lets stick in universe. The Death Eaters were cocky to the extreme, with a madman as their leader who wouldn't care about field-geography or apparent fortifications. And the defenders were mainly academics, with the odd Auror in the mix, plus a huge amount of school children. I totally agree that they did not, in any way, use the advantages of their position, but I'll also say that they may've simply lacked the knowledge to do so.

In a broader statement, I say that using the battle of Hogwarts to determine the overall intelligence of the entire wizards race /maaaaaay/ be a bit of a hasty generalization.

And arthur Weasley... well. Her was a loveable buffoon. If we go meta we can quickly just say: Comedic Relief.

But neither could wizards if they were open about their takeover. There are plenty of missile subs with orders to launch should their country fall. As are hidden launch facilities. And even if just two or three out of a few dozen launch their 16-20 missiles, that easily gives you 400 nuclear warheads, each ~40 times the yield of the Hiroshima bomb. The world would be fucked. It would be a mass extinction event. A Phyrric victory at best.

And since breaking the Imperius requires willpower and not magic, it would be very likely that someone would raise the alarm before wizards could disarm every launch facility.

** Completely depends on the situation and what 'winning' means. A muggle with a sniper rifle could catch a wizard off guard from far away. A wizard who knows what he's up against could easily shield against bullets on the other hand. If you want a war of the worlds, both sides have the capability of wrecking each other's societies if they don't care about collateral damage, but realistically while the muggles have larger numbers and more firepower, those advantages aren't very useful against the wizarding world's capability to stay hidden. A in-the-know muggle army with the support of muggleborns could probably locate and blow up the ministry of magic, just like a group of wizards could release fiendfyre in the muggle government if they don't care about the statute of secrecy. If they do have to keep secrecy the wizards are severely limited in what damage they can cause, but it doesn't stop them from imperiusing important officials. The deciding factor is probably the muggleborns as they can deal damage to either world while staying hidden in the other, using both magical and muggle means. They are also the only ones who know the exact capabilities of both worlds. If it's purebloods and the ministry vs muggleborns and the muggles then the muggles have a decent chance. If it's all wizards vs the muggles the muggles just don't have enough information on the wizarding world to do much, they wouldn't be able to find the wizards in the first place.

*** They could set up bunkers, and with Magic, they would have them running extremely fast. There was a thread like this in [[/r/hpfanfiction][r/hpfanfiction]] a while ago, let me copy paste my comment here, see what you think:

Muggles dont even stand a chance. Its the same thing you would see in alien invasion movies. The enemy is so advanced that they might as well be gods. I think the big problem in this discussion is when people imagine such a war in conventional terms. In that case yeah, wizardkind doesnt stand a chance, purely due to the superior numbers of Muggles. But in a real war (and in a more meta way, if such a war was to be written realistically, considering the abilities magic gives), wizards could obliterate all muggle nations without even breaking the statue of secrecy. Just from the top of my head, here are some suggestions:

Infiltrate the government buildings of nations with nuclear missiles, place an Imperio on whoever can order such strikes, and then enjoy the show. This could be done through apparition, Animagus form, transfigurations, polyjuice, and probably few more I cant think of on the spot. I think it is safe to assume that magical ministries do place wards and guards next to such persons, but nothing is unbreachable. Hell, not even Hogwarts or Gringotts were, I doubt a muggle presidential palace is.

Send wizards to assassinate the command structures of muggle armies, at least the most powerful ones. Just apparate in their homes.

Use polyjuice for false-flag ops. Terrorist attacks, false military operations, assassinations. Enough to either spark an all out war or social turmoil and violence.

Apparate at power plants and take them down. On a similar note, apparate across countries and burn down the agricultural field.

Apparate on oil rigs and take them down. Also on a similar note, take down shipments of oil.

Biological warfare. Im sure there are plenty of potions or viruses that wizards have/could develop which could balance the numbers, so to speak. Heck, just pour the draught of living death in the water supplies.

These are just the things I can think of on the spot. Grindelwald was right when he asked who the law (statute of secrecy) protects. Its meant to keep muggles safe, not wizardkind. If you look at it realistically, wizards could conquer earth with ease. In fact, I think the more technologically advanced muggles are, the easier it would be for wizards to kill them off, or subdue them.

Nah. Wizards will win...

If the muggleborns side with the muggles, the purebloods would be too ignorant of the muggle world to pull it off, even muggle-friendly purebloods can't pronounce electricity correctly, and if the muggleborns support the muggles they'd have a chance at destroying important locations of the wizarding world like the ministry or diagon alley.

But a war? Wizards. It's not even a question. Wizards regularly warp time and space, which would make them completely impervious to discovery, much less being assaulted. Meanwhile, compulsions and truth serums means that finding whoever or whatever the wizards need to find an exercise in tedium.

Just grab a random muggle and force them to tell you who they think is most important to the war. Go to that person and repeat, while also asking what they think would be the most damaging thing to do. Pretty quickly you'll have everyone who's anyone either under your control or dead.

** One on one is a clean sweep for muggle

If it was close range like 10ft or something the muggle could just grab the wand and snap it, now the wizard is screwed. If the muggle couldn't go for the wand then the muggle would straight up punch them. because the wizard has to first pull the wand and then say the spell but by that time he would have already been punched or attacked by some other means. Wizards are nothing more than people and I don't recall there being any spell that stops someone from Germans suplexing them.

Long distance goes to muggle because you may have a wand but a gun fires faster, the bullet travels faster, and it's quicker than pointing a wand and saying a spell. Now everyone will say something like the wizard could stop / deflect the bullet. And I totally agree for one bullet it doesn't stop the muggle from firing more.

It's similar reasoning for an all out war because tank beats dragon any day of the week.

** It would be a draw. In the initial stages, the wizards have the advantage since muggleborns know about muggles while muggles know nothin'. However, sooner or later, the muggles will get their hands on at least a few wizards. And we know, how efficient the CIA's torture methods are.

As the battle prolongs, the wizards lose their advantage of having superior knowledge. Many of the commenters here seem to have no idea how the military works. I'm currently serving and have seen first hand how scary an organised military can be. Attack Gringotts and Wizarding Britain falls. Goblin guards? Send an infantry battalion. Dragon? Send an armour battalion. Protective charms and wards? Send an artillery battalion. Boom. Gringotts is gone.

Wizards might use memory charms etc to manipulate the leaders of the muggle world? Well, once the war begins, muggle leaders are going to be hiding in fortified bunkers with dozens of guards.

As for a one-to-one fight between a wizard and a muggle? A wizard would win. However, a muggle soldier vs an Auror? Aurors and Wizards are not trained to kill. Muggle soldiers are. And muggle military personnel alone are probably superior in numbers compared to the entire wizarding world.

However, if the wizards change to guerilla tactics, it would be nearly impossible to eradicate them. Invisibility cloaks, disillusion, muggle-repelling wards etc would make the survivors extremely hard to find. Hence, a draw seems most likely.

** No one would win. In my opinion, Muggles could exterminate the Wizards... but at such terrible cost that it couldn't be called a victory.

To all that advocates for wizards supremacy, I have these points to make:

First of all, what people get wrong is that magic is NOT as all powerful as they think. People thinks that every single wizard in existence is as powerful as Dumbledore or Voldemort, while in reality even Arthur Weasley is an above average wizard. It is stated that a lot of wizards working for the Government can't even cast a decent protection spell.

Second, most spells are NOT as powerful as many people think they are. Protection spells CAN be penetrated if enough force is applied (you see wizards dodging all the time, otherwise they could simply spam the Shield Charm). Imperius spells CAN be resisted by individuals with enough willpower. Invisibility still leaves you vulnerable to any other kind of detection (heat vision, radar, etc) unless additional spells are included. Spells themself tend to fade and fail over time unless recharged or casted with incredible ability. And to top it all off, a trained muggle soldier with a gun is LEAGUES faster than a wizard: pulling the trigger is much faster than shouting (even if only in your mind) "avada kedavra".

Third, Muggles outnumber Wizards by several order of magnitudes. It's entirely possible that there are more Muggle soldiers than there are Wizards period. And numbers are certainly something wizards have to take into consideration: most spells are made with only one target in mind, and you can say avada kedavra only a few times before a crowd reaches you.

Still, Wizards are still too powerful to be defeated. While they are vulnerable to suprise attacks, they are almost invulnerable if they have time to prepare (especially cause they can apparate), they can disguise themself perfectly, dominate people, etc. And to top it all off, they can hide almost perfectly from human eyes. If they stuck to guerrilla warfare and terrorism, they could pretty much do as they please, especially cause they are so few and so scattered that the muggles would have no way to actually fight them face to face.

Still, the conflict would not end in anyone's favour. The paranoia in Muggle communities once they know that they are at war with wizards would make nigh impossible for wizards to mix with them, and it's stated that mixing with muggles is the only way that's keeping wizards from getting extinct. Plus, with their mingling numbers, it would be nigh impossible for wizards to actually control all muggles, and their numbers would be even more reduced by ambushes and guerilla from the muggle side.

So, I'd say that the Wizards would win most, if not all, the battles, but they would lose the war as they would get close to extiction in a couple of generations.

If you're using canon wizards as a baseline the muggles would wipe the floor with them pretty easily. Let's see your shield charm stand up to a 50 BMG round aimed right at your skull. Not even gonna get into what the carnage would be like if muggles went scorched earth and just dropped a nuke.

Now if you're using fanon for a basis it's an entirely different story. Insanely OOC and OP wizards could just glass the shit out of everything with some obscure parseltongue battlemagic dragonfucking spell or some shit.

*** Lmao. I got a 2 replies destroying the wizards will win narrative:

1: As the battle prolongs, the wizards lose their advantage of having superior knowledge. Many of the commenters here seem to have no idea how the military works. I'm currently serving and have seen first hand how scary an organised military can be. Attack Gringotts and Wizarding Britain falls. Goblin guards? Send an infantry battalion. Dragon? Send an armour battalion. Protective charms and wards? Send an artillery battalion. Boom. Gringotts is gone.

Wizards might use memory charms etc to manipulate the leaders of the muggle world? Well, once the war begins, muggle leaders are going to be hiding in fortified bunkers with dozens of guards.

It would be a draw. In the initial stages, the wizards have the advantage since muggleborns know about muggles while muggles know nothin'. However, sooner or later, the muggles will get their hands on at least a few wizards. And we know, how efficient the CIA's torture methods are.

However, if the wizards change to guerilla tactics, it would be nearly impossible to eradicate them. Invisibility cloaks, disillusion, muggle-repelling wards etc would make the survivors extremely hard to find. Hence, a draw seems most likely. As for a one-to-one fight between a wizard and a muggle? A wizard would win. However, a muggle soldier vs an Auror? Aurors and Wizards are not trained to kill. Muggle soldiers are. And muggle military personnel alone are probably superior in numbers compared to the entire wizarding world. However, if the wizards change to guerilla tactics, it would be nearly impossible to eradicate them. Invisibility cloaks, disillusion, muggle-repelling wards etc would make the survivors extremely hard to find. Hence, a draw seems most likely. And I almost forgot another key factor - speed. Let's say Wizarding Britain and Wizarding Bulgaria decide to attack muggle France. Fudge sends a message by owl. The owl would take several days to travel to Bulgaria.

In comparison, Theresa May gives Putin a call. “Let's attack Wizarding France.” “Sure. “ Within 15 minutes, both sides would have already scrambled a squadron of fighter jets each. Within 4 hours, both countries would have a battalion-sized force ready.

2; Edit: Also, you don't need to see something to hit it. You can fire artillery by aiming at a "hole" in the map. And again, good luck hitting tactical nuclear warheads as they come at you at supersonic speeds. An ICBM warhead has a terminal velocity of several thousand meters per second. Good luck hitting that with a spell, nevermind multiple warheads carried by one missile. Also, you'd need to track down all missile submarines before they can launch, and again, good luck with that.

That's why it's completely stupid and total wizard wank if someone thinks they could be intercepted by some spells in the flight. The obvious counter to that are SSBNs. Good luck finding every single missile submarine with standing orders to launch should their country fall. Each is capable of turning earth into a nuclear wasteland. Especially the Russian Typhoons, which have the same displacement as a treaty battleship.

It's nearly impossible for the navies which do that for a living, nevermind wizards whose experts are too stupid to consider buying a book to answer the question "what are rubber ducks for".

** They could set up bunkers, and with Magic, they would have them running extremely fast. There was a thread like this in [[/r/hpfanfiction][r/hpfanfiction]] a while ago, let me copy paste my comment here, see what you think:

Muggles dont even stand a chance. Its the same thing you would see in alien invasion movies. The enemy is so advanced that they might as well be gods. I think the big problem in this discussion is when people imagine such a war in conventional terms. In that case yeah, wizardkind doesnt stand a chance, purely due to the superior numbers of Muggles. But in a real war (and in a more meta way, if such a war was to be written realistically, considering the abilities magic gives), wizards could obliterate all muggle nations without even breaking the statue of secrecy. Just from the top of my head, here are some suggestions:

Infiltrate the government buildings of nations with nuclear missiles, place an Imperio on whoever can order such strikes, and then enjoy the show. This could be done through apparition, Animagus form, transfigurations, polyjuice, and probably few more I cant think of on the spot. I think it is safe to assume that magical ministries do place wards and guards next to such persons, but nothing is unbreachable. Hell, not even Hogwarts or Gringotts were, I doubt a muggle presidential palace is.

Send wizards to assassinate the command structures of muggle armies, at least the most powerful ones. Just apparate in their homes.

Use polyjuice for false-flag ops. Terrorist attacks, false military operations, assassinations. Enough to either spark an all out war or social turmoil and violence.

Apparate at power plants and take them down. On a similar note, apparate across countries and burn down the agricultural field.

Apparate on oil rigs and take them down. Also on a similar note, take down shipments of oil.

Biological warfare. Im sure there are plenty of potions or viruses that wizards have/could develop which could balance the numbers, so to speak. Heck, just pour the draught of living death in the water supplies.

These are just the things I can think of on the spot. Grindelwald was right when he asked who the law (statute of secrecy) protects. Its meant to keep muggles safe, not wizardkind. If you look at it realistically, wizards could conquer earth with ease. In fact, I think the more technologically advanced muggles are, the easier it would be for wizards to kill them off, or subdue them.

Here you go.

** I lean towards the mundanes beating the magicals.

Given how magicals treat mundanes, like they're fragile china dolls at best and completely beneath them at worst, I wouldn't be surprised if mages with mundane loved ones turn on the magical side, so it's impossible to assume the mundanes won't gain assistance from spellcasters. Likewise, it's not unlikely mages with an upbringing in the mundane world who wish to ingratiate themselves upon the magical world won't try to use mundane technology to swing the war in favor of the magical world.

There's also a question of whether the International Statute of Secrecy keeps magic from mundane world leaders. If mundane world leaders do know about magic, then it's very likely they've already put contingencies for something exactly like a war with the magical world in place, in which case, the magical world is probably very behind the curve, because the magical world seems to think the mundane world stopped advancing sometime after the Victorian age.

Even if the magical world were to get the upper hand in at first, the mundane population still vastly outnumbers the magical population, and if pressed, the mundane population can adopt a strategy similar to China did against the United States during the Korean War, where they sent wave after wave of Chinese soldiers onto the battlefield despite being outrageously outgunned, and as the American soldiers killed Chinese soldiers en masse, the American forces lost morale and became increasingly depressed, because normal people are not wired for becoming mass murderers, which is what they become when they're forced to mow down countless number of enemy soldiers. Add in the fact that the mundane forces can literally thrown bodies at the magical forces faster than the magical forces can kill them, and you may well end up with something like a zombie apocalypse, where the mundane forces just keep coming despite how hard the magical forces try to kill them all, until the magical forces are simply overwhelmed by sheer numbers.

And this doesn't even take conventional weaponry versus magic spells into account. Remember, conventional weaponry is designed to severely hurt its targets; meanwhile, most magical individuals, though knowledgeable in combat arts due to coursework in Defense Against the Dark Arts, only know spells which briefly incapacitate their targets. Most magical individuals are not capable of casting the Unforgivables; most of them don't even know of the existence of /Sectumsempra/, the all-purpose Severing Charm; the Severing Charm most people know is /Diffindo/, which apparently can't be used on a live subject. Meanwhile, anybody can pick up a pistol or a rifle and be able to use it, even if they don't understand how the mechanics of it functions.

** Muggles. Muggle intelligence services are incredibly well funded, we can expect them to know everything that the average Hogwarts student can learn in Hogwarts and they'll be able to procure obscure books for more info. They will have strong operational security to be able to defend against the most common mind attacks by Wizards and they'll hire Muggleborns (living in exile from the Wizarding World) to cast protections.

When muggles go to war it will also be a very coordinated strike that the Wizards will not see coming (because of their arrogance and poor understanding of Muggle politics/culture). It will be a 1 day war.

** Muggles. In a war today, muggles would be much more technologically advanced, and seeing as wizards decide to be so isolated from muggles, I guess they'd rely solely on magical power. With extremely fast and easy to use guns, with the addition of nuclear power, wizards would take a much bigger blow on their population than muggles, since they're a minority group already. Because of this, it makes a lot of sense that wizards decided to go into hiding (apart from a mentioned war between the two groups in the past? But I don't really know how that went or who won, though I'd guess it was muggles?).

*** There never is a war mentioned in canon. Muggles and Wizards, as far as we've been told, didn't have a war between each other.

Nuclear power is nice and dandy, but wizards live amongst muggles. Britain won't nuke London, the French won't nuke Paris and the US government won't nuke New York. Wizards have muggles as their meat shield.

Guns are debatable. We know that wizards have a concept of what a gun is, and how its used. Its safe to assume that Aurors have a working knowledge of them. And if they have knowledge about guns, I would also assume that /at least/ the Auror forces have some way of defending against it. Plus, using a rifle is not that easy, actually. You'll hit great on a firing range, sure. But will a soldier also hit great when his comrades are blown to pieces by colorful light, some robe wearing maniac conjures sentient fire and your Humvee is currently a bison? Maybe?

** It depends. Magic in the HP universe is really soft so it is hard to say. What is the win state? Would muggles accept total destruction as a win option. Could they capture a single wizard or sample of wizard only disease and weaponize it? What percentage of the magical population would need to die? How many on either side would side against themselves? Can a sufficiently willful muggle resist the imperious?

​

Depending on how these shake out it could go either way. IF mutual destruction is an acceptable win state the muggles can win via destruction of the environment, but so can the mages. If a chemical or bio agent can be developed in secret the mages don't catch until it has been unleashed, muggles probably win. If muggleborn would opt to fight against the wizarding world rather than for it, muggles would probably win via longer range, silent weapon options. If muggles can resist certain magics, it gets fuzzier.

​

If none of these things, mages can probably win, for a time, but if they don't go full genocide, the muggles will eventually overthrow them. The Harry Potter Universe makes sense only if there is a reason for the statute of secrecy. Since the wizarding world does have an economy, scarcity is a thing for it. Ergo, their would be something to be gained by ruling the world, and we see people like young Dumbledore and Grindelwald agree with the goal. Or just basic human nature to place yourselves above others and be superior would drive someone to want to rule. It doesn't have to be every mage, but the ones that would want to rule would likely be the stronger and more influential ones.

​

Yet, the ICW and others are willing to wage war to maintain the Statute. There must be a reason for this.

​

Other possibilities for the Statute:

Perhaps the church has a means to counter magic with faith, paladin/templar types that know how to wipe out mages.

Maybe there is a Helsing style organization.

Maybe too much magic in the world opens the ways for fey and demons which prey on humans so ancient mages opted to seal away and hide magic to close those.
