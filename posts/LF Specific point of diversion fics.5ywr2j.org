I'm looking for fics where the point of divergence is when something goes differently during the DoM business.

No Pottercest, slash, or harem please!

Thanks

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10959290/1/][Harry Potter and the Spygirl]], linkffn(10959290): The Grangers were NOT what they appeared to be, and Hermione was programmed early on as a Spygirl. She was activated during the DoM battle, and things went drastically different afterwards.

  Her father had told Harry that if Hermione was in danger he should hold that box in front of her and push the button. He'd never have expected that a series of flashing lights would transform Hermione into "Spygirl". Fortunately, the dozen Death Eaters facing them hadn't expected that either. Harry Potter/Spyboy crossover.

*** I'm thinking more like someone dies in the DoM, or Harry isn't an idiot and gets help. Something like "A Fate Touched in Middle Earth", though it doesn't necessarily have to be a crossover
