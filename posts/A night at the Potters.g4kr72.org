A Neighborhood looking like any other, except for a few older houses that definitely should not be standing that crooked. The sun is shining very bright, outside a single house we see a tall man with long dark hair laying in the grass outside a home with a sign saying “Godrics Hollow 7 -- The Potters” by the driveway.

The dark haired man lays in the grass with his eyes closed and humming on a light tune. A big blob of water, floating over his head. And a man pointing a wand out of the window. We hear a loud yell “Sirius!” from the front door, and a red haired Lady standing there. He opens his eyes, and the water drops in his face as the man in the window lowers his wand. A sound /Snap!/ and then the man suddenly appears right next to Sirius. “James, I see Lilly finally let you out. How was the honeymoon!?” They hug briefly before Lilly comes to drag them both indoors by the arm.

“You two know better! Prancing around in the yard with Death-Eaters out.” Said Lilly. James and Sirius looked down to the floor, then up at her, smiling. “Come get some tee Sirius, it's almost time for the news. I heard Dumbledore was going to be on it.” They sat down, and James became very serious. He patted Sirius on the shoulder and said, “I have some bad news Padfoot, and I urge you not to make any rash decisions now” Sirius nodded and James Continued: “We have spoken to The Lestranges, they want to recruit us to their side, to you-know-whos' side. We tried saying no but you know that lot, they will retaliate. They don't take denial easy.” Sirius looked stunned, he got up from his chair and said: “Lilly, James, this is not something to take lightly. They have tried to recruit my whole family, but they are purebloods they will not suffer consequences, as you will. Now for the time being, I will stay here with you as protection until we can reach The Order. Moreover, I will let Remus know so we can take shifts outside. Prongs... This is not negotiable.”

Lilly waves her wand and from the radio in the corner they hear a /clink/ as it turns on. /Now to the news; “Three more muggle-borns wizards have disappeared in Little Hangleton late last night, their wifes reported them missing after they went out for drinks to not return”/ “Probably just drunk in a ditch” said Sirius. /Now to a few words from Albus Dumbledore/ The calm voice of Dumbledore gave a presence of authority in the room as all three went quiet. “Now a lot of disappearances and killings in the name of Lord Voldemort has been devastating to our whole community. However, in these times of need, love is our great strength. I implore all wizards and witches to seek help from us. You all know where to find me, behind the Gargoyle at Hogwarts.” /Now on to sports!/ “ England Beater Ludo Bagm.” Sirius Waved his wand and the radio /clinked/ again as it turn of.

A Sharp /Snap/ is heard outside and a little plump man knocks the door and walks in. He struggles to walk and seems to favor his right leg. “How are you doing Peter?” Lilly asks as she goes to hug him. His squeaky voice stutters as he tries to say “gggood, thank you” Sirius and James smiles and welcomes him into the living room.

As night gathers around there is a full moon in the night sky. They hear a howl and look worried at each other, "Moony? Lilly asks the group" "no much worse, Fenrir" Peter says shakingly. James looks at Peters leg, then up at him: "Did you get bit?" He continues to shake and then explodes sobbing and crying into sirius' lap. "They hit me in the leg with some kind of curse. I think it was Snape!" Lillys face contorted and then she gave Peter a smile and said: " It's going to be alright, let me take a look at that leg. I am no st. Mungos but i know a thing or two." James and Sirius continued planning the protection of the house througout the night as Peter fell asleep in the sofa next to them.

After a few hours and a couple shots of firewhisky James asked "Where is Remus?" "At Belbys, they are working on something in secret. I thought maybe you knew, as you are paying his bills" Sirius said with a faint sadness on his face. "Old Moony isnt the same after getting rejected.. can't hold down a job it seems." At this point Lilly seemed to have had enough, she stood up and said to the both of them "you both know that he is asked to leave as soon as anyone finds out! And you shouldnt doubt Remus for one second Sirius.. he is a good man!" Then stormed off. "Seems like we had one too many James, off to bed, ill watch the house." Sirius said as they both stood up, he patted James on the shoulder, ruffled his hair and he went upstairs. Sirius went outside put out the light with his wand, transformed into a big black dog, and curled up on the front porch.
