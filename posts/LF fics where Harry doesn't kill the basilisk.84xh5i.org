I am looking for fics where Harry doesn't kill the basilisk. The reason doesn't really matter as long as the basilisk ends up as an ally of his some way.

  Hermione glanced around. "So you're really the Heiress? I'd just assumed you had caught Harry's sense of humor."

  "Of course I am," Ginevra said. "I command the Basilisk."

  She hissed, "Come." Or possibly "Strangle." Her accent was terrible. The Basilisk slithered towards us, students scrambling out of its way. It came to rest beside Ginevra, eyes closed and waiting for instructions.

  "Go sleep twice," Ginevra said. "Only need look terrifying."

  I would like to reiterate the horror that was Ginevra Weasley attempting to speak Parseltongue. The Basilisk silently accepted this butchery of the language, returning to an empty corner where it curled into a ball.

Mm, it doesn't really qualify if your looking for something involving the basilisk. It's more of a casual reference to not-murder here, although the Chamber is something of a plot point. Still a good fic...

  “Just... tell me.

Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.
