Personally, I write about 2500 words on any day that I'm writing, though I only write 3 or 4 days a week. I feel if I write any slower, nothing gets done and I lose the flow of my prose, and if it's any longer, the writing becomes a bit terrible. Obviously, it comes and goes with inspiration, but I feel I write my best when I'm at about 2500.

So, how is it for you?


** It ebbs and flows. Some days I can't write my name, other days I write 5k words. I never really set specific times or dates, I just work on whatever "project" has my interest at the moment. The secret of writing is what I've found to be: only write when and what you enjoy.

Make time, be consistent, and most importantly /have fun/.

*** I definitely agree, though for me I find joy in the grind I suppose. I like it when it's challenging and I have to work to find the next part of the plot. Some of my happiest moments writing are when I'm stuck and trying to figure out which word I should write next.

I also feel like writing is a skill, and if you don't use it, it goes away. I want to be as good as I possibly can be, and I'm at my best when I'm writing almost every day.

** 1k is a good day for me. 3k is a great day. Most days I usually average 500 though, if I write at all. Hence, my writing takes a freaking age to get through. I have a fanfic I've been updating since January 2017 and I've only managed to write 25k for it.

In general though, I just push myself to try and write every day and don't really bother with hitting a specific word count. I write what I'm comfortable with, and however much works for me in the moment. I may end up deleting a whole lot of what I write, but at least I've explored avenues in the story and decided that I didn't want to go down that path.

*** I get that. I know with my story, I first started in August 2016 and, up until December 2017, it was only 35k. Then I just got into the swing of things, and I've written 100k this year already. Sometimes you just hit inspiration, or direction, and everything clicks.

** I usually don't set a specific number for myself but instead write based on scenes in my chapters. Normally, I have anywhere from 4 - 6 scenes per chapter and try to write 1 - 2 a day. Of course, in a typical week, I average writing 4 or so days. Also, I sometimes put an estimated word count on my planned scenes, just to get an idea of what neighborhood I'll be delivering into but I never, ever hit that estimated mark. I come in either too low or too high. For example, one scene I wrote just yesterday I budgeted it around 1,200 words. It came in at 4,160 words instead.

** It depends on how easily the idea comes. I don't always write every day, but I usually get about 1200 words or so on average. I've done as much as 6 or 7k when the juices are really flowing. I did 200 words this morning before I left for the gym and I'll add more to that in dribs and drabs throughout the day.

** Made me think of this:

#+begin_quote
  [Hermione] was not the only person acting oddly as the OWLs drew steadily nearer. Ernie Macmillan had developed an irritating habit of interrogating people about their revision practices.

  ‘How many hours d'you think you're doing a day?' he demanded of Harry and Ron as they queued outside Herbology, a manic gleam in his eyes.

  ‘I dunno,' said Ron. ‘A few.'

  ‘More or less than eight?'

  ‘Less, I s'pose,' said Ron, looking slightly alarmed.

  ‘I'm doing eight,' said Ernie, puffing out his chest. ‘Eight or nine. I'm getting an hour in before breakfast every day. Eight's my average.

  'I can do ten on a good weekend day. I did nine and a half on Monday. Not so good on Tuesday -- only seven and a quarter. Then on Wednesday --'
#+end_quote

Just saying -- whatever works. I write a lot that never gets posted.

** When I write, I usually settle down to write a scene, which is usually between 700 and 3k words. Sometimes I'll really get into the fic, and write up to 5k in a sitting, but that doesn't happen super often. For the first fan fic I wrote, I struggled with getting over 2k words per chapter, and wrote a bit under 40k words in a year. With my latest series, I've cleared over 100k words since July. Like [[/u/TheGeneralStarfox][u/TheGeneralStarfox]] said, writing is definitely a skill, and one that gets better over time.

** It honestly depends. I've maybe written like 2k words in the last two weeks. But there have been days where I'll write 5k words. Months where I write 10k, months where I write 50k. Right now I'm already tired of writing this comment.

** Ok, so it's been a while but I do recall that I pomodoro'd myself to check an average. And with 15 minute blocks I'd write 500-750 if I didn't have the scene planned. But if I did I'd nearly double it and always go over 1K. Which would have been a good day if I did it for eight hours straight. But I think a full pomodoro of writing a day is a good start. If one feels like it one could continue with a second and a third set.

I'll most likely get back to it next year.

**** Pomodoro Timer, is basically a system where you work for X amount of time, and take a break for Y amount of time until you've done it four or five times. Which is when you take a longer break for Z amount of time. All of this is so that you can keep yourself somewhat focused on the task at hand. But not burning yourself out.

** I struggle to put out 1k a day even when I set aside the time. My problem is that I'm something of a perfectionist. Doesn't mean my writing's good, not at all, but that I obsess over wording, constantly rewrite sentences, etc. I know logically that the best way is to just /write/ and come back to edit later, but it's a hard habit to shake.

** I /try/ to write at least 500 words a day that I'm satisfied with, but will not stop if I'm in a good flow. It really changes a lot from then on out. Sometimes I even struggle with the 500, sometimes I push out 7000 and feel great about them. It's really depending on how I'm feeling.

** For me, I can write 5k words quickly and none of it will ever be in any relation to the project at hand. Or, I can open my laptop, stare at a blank word document and then leave it sitting there for weeks at a time. Sometimes I can write a quick conversation between characters, or describe a part of a scene and then piece things together... I type fast, so when my idea is flushed out on the screen (or paper) I can go weeks before another hits me. Depends on what I'm typing, where I'm typing, why I'm typing, and if there's an enforced deadline

** On a day when I only have time in the evening: 500-1000 words

On a day with extra downtime: 1000-3000

On a busy day (typical, 4 days out of the week for me at the moment): 0-100

In short, depends on life events. My last long fic (114K words) was done in 3 months. But I had so much more time then. My current one that will be around the same length has taken 7 months so far.

** For me there's a bit of preparing before I begin to write. Usually I take a few days to come up with the entire chapter on my head; what I think should be there. Then I go on to plan the scenes; how I imagine it would play out with the people involved. Once I have those things then I begin. If I'm just regurgitating words in my head I could get to 3k words in about 5 hours. If I'm thinking about things like style, appropriate words, voice, showing instead of telling, etc. I can get about 1k words in those same 5 hours. The former, while faster to finish, takes a lot of editing to become decent and has a higher chance of needing a complete rewrite. The later takes longer and can be more frustrating, but usually comes out better at the end and with fewer rewrites.

** It really depends but I tend to write a lot of stuff that never gets anywhere. For example I am writing on the next chapter for one of my stories and then get an idea for something different so I start writing a one-shot where Teddy and Delphi were raised as siblings by Andromeda, Harry and Tonks and only realise 1000 words in that it is far too angsty so I try go back to writing the chapter but at that point, my motivation for that day is gone so it's time for World of Warships.

** When I actually have time to write fic instead of just read it, my average is similar to my pro fiction: 2000 to 4000 depending on what I'm writing +and how quickly my deadline is coming up+.

But that's an average. Some days I literally write a dozen words; on most I hit my daily minimum of 2000; and on some rare, beautiful days, I'll magically reach a count ≥5000.

(Also, with fic, it's easier for me to zoom past 2000 words since world-building and characterization tend to be built in.)

** I usually write between 15 and 20 pages, which QUOTEV tells me is like 5000 words to 7000 words. It takes me like a week to make a chapter, but I'm taking a lot longer with my latest one because my brain stopped working and I had to do some major reorganizing of certain plot points to make some things make sense or pay off later. :) Also to add more details and flesh out stuff, because my best friend Achille gave me that tip since he says my story seems to move too fast.
