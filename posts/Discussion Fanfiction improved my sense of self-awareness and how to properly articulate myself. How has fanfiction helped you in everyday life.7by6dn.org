Particularly, the importance of wording, timing, and tone. It also taught me how to properly flesh-out characters, setting etc in a story, while also fanning the flames of creativity.


** Well, I've gotten better at getting into Internet arguments.

Shit, that isn't helping me.

** Fanfiction is what made me realize that there is an audience for pretty much everything.

I can write pretty much anything (as long as the quality of the writing itself isn't garbage of course) and someone out there might at least be interested in what I put on each page.

I really didn't have the confidence to write the things that strayed away from common understanding until I saw that AU stuff can actually reach an audience.

Now here I am outlining a fairly ridiculous Fanfic for Lord of the Rings where the ring has complete agency and it's speaking to/influencing the people that it meets in order to bring Middle Earth into the age of Man.

**** I wasn't. If I remember correctly I was rewatching a Silent Hill 2 letsplay.

The Lord of the Rings thing came from me re-reading Fellowship recently and getting caught up on the line:

"It was not Gollum, Frodo, but the ring itself that decided things. The Ring left him."

With that line, I kind of got obsessed and started retelling the entire story in my head but largely from the point of view of the ring who decided to betray its master and move the world out of its current age and into the future.

** I don't know if I would call it helping, but it made me a lot more critical of writing in general. I now pay way more more attention to writing style and quality and appreciate a good plot, characterizations and dialogue.

Although the side effect of this is that I no longer enjoy a lot of fics since I am way too critical of random things and generally stop reading if I see something I don't like.

** Not sure if this constitutes as everyday life, but writing more FanFiction has helped me understand that "flowery language" isn't universally spoken, and for good reason. Also, sometimes the best details given in stories are the ones that aren't accurately depicted, in the sense that the reader uses his/her own imagination to draw out the scene that's in front of them.

** Fanfiction is what introduced me to the concept of asexuality. After having broken up with my boyfriend because I found kissing him to be weird and uncomfortable, I really thought that there might be something wrong with me. It was really great to learn that I'm not alone, and that I'm not broken. I don't know that I ever would have discovered asexuality in enough detail to feel comfortable identifying that way if it weren't for fanfic.

*** This is ridiculously close to my own experience in life o_o

I never dated anyone, but fanfiction was also what made me realize I'm asexual. I had severe misconceptions about asexuality, and was trying to understand my own sexuality, and then I related 100% with an asexual character in a fanfic and thought "wait, so THAT'S what I am?!". After that I researched asexuality and yes, so that's what I am.

** Fanfiction made me really great at writing porn.

Sounds useless, I know, but now I actually do that semi-professionally, and I make money publishing erotica - I don't think before I started writing fanfic that I ever would have thought I could end up making some money out of those skills, you know? Except for the very vague "famous author" day dreams lots of people have.

** The wealth in gay characters definitly opened up a whole new world for me. I'm from a small-ish non-English speaking town, and while our library was pretty great it didn't have a lot of books with gay characters. And when they did, it usually didn't say so on the back so you just had to read all the books to stumble upon a homosexual here or there (which was fine by me, I read a lot). Maybe a librarian would have been able to help, but no way my young closeted self was going to ask for that.

Cue me learning enough English to explore the internet, and finding out about fanfiction. Here were all these stories about people just like me, and I loved it. It didn't matter that it was all about gay guys and I'm a girl, just the fact that the standard romance wasn't boy-meets-girl really helped me. And I could read it all by myself, didn't have to explain to my parents what I was reading or save up money to buy the books (in which case I would probably have to order them somewhere anyway, the book store had the same problem as the library). When I look back at the fics I read and liked back then I cringe at the writing, they were honestly pretty horrible. I definitely learned better ways of looking for fanfiction, haha. But that's okay, since those horrible fics helped me come to terms with my own sexuality. Representation is important ;)

** Fan fiction was what got me into writing in the first place. For years I had had issues with essay writing due to various learning disabilities but fanfic was where I really learned how to write. I've looked at my old work and I've seen the time progression improvements. Honestly without fanfic I wouldn't be the writer I am today.

** How has fanfiction helped me in everyday life? Let me think.

Well, writing generally (which started with fanfiction) has destroyed my social life, diet and exercise regime. So nothing really, if I'm honest. I'm not about to stop though, because it's a sort of compulsion I don't want to resist.
