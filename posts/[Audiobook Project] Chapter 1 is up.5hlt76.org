Hello, everyone,

Chapter One of Not From Others is finally up. You can find it on my SoundCloud.

[[https://soundcloud.com/the-piano-prodigy/not-from-others-chapter-1]]

Let me know what you think I could improve on. I love opportunities to grow.

Thanks,

ThePianoProdigy


** You either have a lisp or the microphone does some weird stuff with your s sounds. You also have some reverberation in the sounds, making the whole thing sound a bit unprofessional (which I know it is, of course).

For the next chapter (or a rework of this one, maybe) you should also try to pronounce words clear, make pauses and stress the punctuation. This sounds a lot like you're reading to the class. However, you want to make an audiobook. Your reading should sound more relaxed, like you're telling me a story in front of the chimney. I also heard some pauses in your reading. There is no shame in re-recording a paragraph and cutting it in.

Anyway, solid work. Excuse me if I was a bit overzealous with my critic, but as someone with a sounddesign education, I can't overhear some stuff.

*** Yes, I'm aware I have a lisp, do you have any idea how I can fix that?

**** Well, first tip is, of course, visit a professional. Speech therapy is a sure shot way of getting rid of any sort of speech aberration.

For a first, quick and dirty, way of exercising against a lisp there are a few ways of doings so. It /sounds/ like a frontal lisp. I'm in no way a speech therapist, so take this "diagnosis" with a very big grain of salt.

If it is a frontal lisp, then your problem is that your tongue pushes too far against your teeth when forming the s sound. Basically, the fix is to "reign in" your tongue. If you're not doing it already, make it a habit, whenever you think about it, to rest your tongue against the roof of your mouth. Also consciously make the s sound, while controlling your tongue. The tongue should then press with the tip slightly behind your teeth. Try to keep your tongue and facial muscles relaxed while doing so.

I do want to stress that to control a lisp, a specialist is recommended.
