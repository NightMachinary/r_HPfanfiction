It's this Snape mentors Harry fic, where at some point Harry is upset or something and is taking dreamless sleep, and when it wears off and he wakes up, Snape makes him take another dreamless sleep, and Harry argues at first but then gives in and takes it, and Snape is disappointed.

I've been on a Snape mentors Harry kick lately, and I've been rereading some of my favorites, but I didn't see this one (even though I'm pretty sure I enjoyed this one a lot).

Any help would be nice, thanks!


** I'm pretty sure this scene was in fanfic 'In Blood Only' by E.M.Snape

*** Oh. I didn't reread that when I was looking because I've already read it so many times. Whoops.
