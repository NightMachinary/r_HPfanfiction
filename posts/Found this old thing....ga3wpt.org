So I think I must have had this idea that Harley Quinn would make an interesting witch. And so:

​

Harlequin had given up on intelligence long ago. She could be shrewd when it suited her. She could even be quite sly for her part, but she would never be a font of wisdom and knowledge. Words, numbers, facts, mumbo jumbo---it was nothing but a bore. Harlequin liked people. She liked playing with people. It did not occur to her that they did not like to play back. 

Her Aunt Narcissa did not know, and truly, had never quite known what to make of her. Harlequin had little interest in sitting still and absolutely no patience for the family political pursuits. She'd managed to break every single one of Draco's brooms over the years and had once dropped a nearly priceless gilded scabbard from the Malfoy collection into the lake behind the manor. Sometimes when Harlequin was really bored, and hadn't yet puzzled out how to foil the newest containment charms on her bedroom, she would imagine pulling it back out of the lake and showing it to her Auntie. No one but the grindylows knew how well she'd managled the sword. 

Aunt Narcissa couldn't bear to bring her with them to Diagon Alley anymore either. The one time Harlequin had been brought around, she'd made quick work of a cracked crystal ball in a shop on Knocturn Alley. Harlequin had taken a look into the ball's depths and realized immediately what needed to be done with it. With great force, she'd thrown the crystal at an erumpet horn on the top shelf of the shop. Uncle Lucius had been obliged to buy half the street afterward---what was left of it anyway. 

On the train to Hogwarts, Lucius had found her a compartment and blocked the door while he set about the latest version of his containment charms. “Do NOT embarrass me,” he had threatened. He was simply no fun when he got in one of these moods.

“Embarrass you, Uncle Lucius?” Harlequin had never found a use for such an emotion.

“I do not want a repeat of what happened on the ship to Durmstrang.”

That boring school was supposed to be far stricter than Hogwarts with discipline. That is what Uncle Lucius had told her anyway. Durmstrang had started a week ago, but after an accident with an enlarged bludger had blown a hole in the bottom of the ship, Headmaster Karkaroff had ensured she find schooling elsewhere. Headmaster Dumbledore had accommodated her last minute enrollment, which meant, in Uncle Lucius' mind, that he owed the foul man a favor---or at least something close to good will. Uncle Lucius kept a very low stock of good will.

 With his embossed cane, Uncle Lucius futilely attempted to whack Harlequin's foot out of the way of the sliding door so he could finish the locking charms. Harlequin simply didn't feel like budging though. There were far too many interesting things to see out in the corridor of the train. She'd heard some boys discussing a large spider out on the platform which would surely prove entertaining if she could find it. What's more, she'd never even seen a train before and she was very curious as to how they worked exactly. What made them tick? What held them together? What did the other children aboard think of trains? Why did Uncle Lucius have to find her the least populated place to wait out the train ride anyway? It was sure to be dead boring.

The car was not completely empty however which was proven when the compartment door next to Harlequin's slid open and a small bespectacled boy looked out at Uncle Lucius. He looked decidedly unremarkable to Harlequin, but Uncle Lucius stilled under the boy's gaze. 

“Just stay in the damn compartment,” he'd muttered to her and then swept off the train in a billow of robes.

“Yes Uncle Lucius!” Harlequin called after him. Stepping fully out of the corridor, she let the compartment door slam closed behind her and took a moment to dislodge her wand from where she'd concealed it in her hair. Aunt Narcissa had only given it back to her that morning before they'd disapparated to the train station, she'd taken no chances that her Auntie might have second thoughts.

“Er, nice wand,” said the boy.

He was dressed in drab muggle attire, Harlequin noted. “Thanks, it used to be my mother's,” she said. And with that she set out for the front of the car. She could hear laughing from the adjacent one and wanted to know what it was about.

She didn't make it far though when the toe of her boot caught on something fat and mushy. Harlequin looked down to find a toad sitting in the middle of the corridor floor. Harlequin picked it up and examined it. “Ribbit.” 

She grinned, “Cheeky fellow, you'd be better if you were bigger.” Things were always better when they were bigger. But what was that charm she'd gotten the fourth year Durmstrang student to set on that bludger? Engorgio? She hadn't a clue what to do with her wand to make the spell work---some sort of upward wrist movement and a nice jab. Perhaps another older student would be willing to assist? No one was around in this car though. She'd have to check the next.

“Oi, er, you---you could come sit with me if you wanted. No one else is in here.”

Harlequin glanced back and considered the boy, still standing somewhat listlessly at his open compartment door. He didn't look particularly interesting, “I don't really like sitting,” she told him.

“Oh,” he said. His eyes were sad. Harlequin didn't understand it. Sitting around was boring, nothing to get worked up over.

“You could come with me, I suppose,” she offered, “I'm going to find someone to engorge this toad. One of the older students ought to be able to manage.”

“Alright,” he said, his face brightening at the prospect.

“I'm Harlequin Lestrange.”

“Harry Potter. Nice to meet you.”

...Of course Harry will have to be Batman.


** I absolutely love the idea. Instead of harry going on adventures he is dragged there by harly, it doesn't have to be an antagonistic relationship more along a silently suffering friend going along for the ride. Harry is very powerful but nobody actually notices him when he is around his hyperactive, loud friend harly and he loves it. I imagine a scene where Draco comes and insults harry and his companions in the train compartment but suddenly hears harly voice behind him " Are you being a ponce again drakey?" he runs away and harly says " hmm we need to talk soon". Also considering Harry's mentality if harly remains loyal to him or at least defends him he will remain a loyal friend to her no matter the circumstances. The twins love her along with Dumbledore so they usually cover up for her as much as possible. she blows up a room Dumbledore " Ahh learning by experimenting, 10 points to gryffindor" . she floods a whole classroom, the twins take the blame " it would not do for our protege to be expelled so soon"

** I could see myself enjoying a story like this. It feels very chaotic, which I enjoy immensely.
