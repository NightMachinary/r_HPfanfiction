** Anything by Northumbrian would fit your request nicely. Canon compliant, well written and with a nice spread of characters. Strangers at Drakeshaugh and Grave Days are particularly good. On mobile, so sorry for the lack of links.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), has a very strong Canon feel. Things could have easily gone as in that story.
