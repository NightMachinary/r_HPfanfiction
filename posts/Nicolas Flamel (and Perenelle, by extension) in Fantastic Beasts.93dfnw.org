This may be an unpopular opinion, but does anyone else disagree with the decision to portray Nicolas Flamel as a frail, old man?

In my mind, I have always pictured the Flamels have the appearance of someone in their early-to-mid-fourties, along with the physical capabilities of someone half the age. Rather than primarily demonstrating how immortality impacts upon the body, I hope the movie shows how living for several centuries has affected their mental state. It would make more sense to have these genius alchemists have near-peak conditioned bodies and all their mental facilities, yet still be tired and dragged down by life. This would give their decision in Philosopher's Stone to die a deeper meaning, as even peak immortal life is still an immortal life.

Plus, in their frail state, it is highly unlikely we will see the Flamels kick ass. What do you guys think?


** It's the Elixir of Life not the Elixir of Youth.

The Flamels don't need to kick ass. I think their strength is in providing opinion and perspective, similar to how Dumbledore did in the Harry Potter books (old Dumbledore). Also, to put it bluntly, I don't believe physical prowess is a good predictor of magical prowess. In his current fragile state it easily excludes him from demanding tasks, so instead of thinking "/How will Newt get out of this/" - you'd be thinking "/Why not just ask for Flamel's help?/"

I would have preferred that the Flamels be not so fragile, but appearance-wise I think they're fine. Haven't seen Perenelle yet but I'm sure she's similar.

I'm annoyed that J K Rowling killed off the Flamels in the first book. They would have made interesting characters.

** This was always implied by PS I think, as the Flamels died very quickly upon losing access to the elixir. If it had paused aging, acting as eternal youth, then you'd think upon losing access to the elixir they would resume aging as normal. But that's not what happened.

It did mention they'd die. And the only reason they could set their affairs in order was because they had backup Elixir. If they needed to use Elixir to set their affairs in order, it's implied that they would die fairly quickly after losing access to it.

***** That's my point. This is Dumbledore talking to an eleven year old. He wouldn't go on and on about the life expectancy of another person with Harry. That comment could easily be his way of answering the question without really answering it, or better yet, by implying Flamels' death was soon, he might be giving a friend much needed peace and quiet from the public.

****** Dumbledore could have easily told people they were dead or would die soon without that particular detail about them needing the Elixir to set their affairs in order. Why mention/fabricate that part? Just say they're out of Elixir and they're going to die soon. The fact that it went into a small bit of detail there makes me feel as though JK Rowling wanted it to be taken at face value.

I like to pretend they didn't die too, but it does point to it. It's not as though it takes years to set one's affairs. It takes a few weeks at most. As for Harry being eleven, I don't think that really matters when it comes to Dumbledore. He's proven to be fairly insensitive at times. And if the Flamels wouldn't die for another decade or so, then by your argument, wouldn't Dumbledore have told Harry that to make him feel better about it all?

** I didn't expect him to look old, but I don't really have a problem with it. It also solves one of the plot holes of the book. If Flamel is the only person skilled enough to create the Philosopher's Stone, you'd expect him to be fairly powerful. (Most fanon seems to make him Dumbledore's equal.) So why couldn't he protect the Stone from Voldemort on his own. If he's actually old and frail, that makes more sense.

Besides, maybe he was already old when he created the Stone, and it didn't reverse his natural aging. We don't know exactly how it works.

Not necessarily. Dueling isn't just magical skill/power, it's /speed/. I always thought Flamel (and Hermione, largely), regardless of physical fitness, were capable of amazing magic if they had time to think it through and perform it in calmness, but aren't so good at all at quick spell-firing in the heat of action.

** The thing is though, the mechanics of how the Philosopher's Stone actually works are never really mentioned. It's simply stated you can create the elixir of life and transmutate lead into gold.

Eternal youth and eternal life are not one in the same. A vampire, for instance, is often depicted with eternal youth, but they are only immortal in the sense you have to be very particular in how you kill them.

The Philosopher's Stone, I would say, is symbolic in alchemical studies for enlightenment. Of understanding and wisdom, particularly of the material world. It makes sense that such a thing would translate to eternal life, but not energy or invigoration. Such things are irrelevant to a philosopher or scholar (particularly with magic).

From a cinematic point-of-view though, I suspect a couple of things about Flamel.

1. There is a minor chance that he is related to someone, a distant ancestor, in the main cast. My money is Kowalski, since that would offer a legitimate excuse not to mind-wipe him this time.
2. You may have noticed they were carrying Flamel through a prison/jail during the trailer. His frailty adds an extra 'quirk' that the cast has to work around. It is still leaning towards kids after all, and whacky hijinks are sort of neccessitated (see the whole Niffler and Erumpet scene in the previous film).

**** Yeah, but its not made clear what state the person is left in.

Do they age? Can you chop off their head and they will still live? How often do they need to consume the Elixir? And how long really can you last without it? Why don't the Flamels have a huge supply of it after 600 years? Why can't they give the Elixir to other people?

Really, Dumbledore says they will get there affairs in order and then die. But he never really states how long that would take. Its feasible (unless Rowling issued some off-hand statement I know not of) that the Flamels are in fact still alive throughout the whole series.

** Indeed, I agree - it is not like an alchemist who can't die would want to become that fragile! Hell, we have seen magic give re-grow bones (which humans can't do normally...or at least can't do any longer after they've been fully formed, as early embryos do grow bones!) even give ESP-Like perception (liquid luck! The potion makes you "lucky" - part of which is pulling off stunts you normally couldn't and dodging attacks you can't see (an attack from behind!))...I really doubt that the ability to make someone appear younger (and give them strenght etc. like a young person!) eludes wizards! Those potions and spells would have probably been discovered way way way before liquid luck or the sorcerer's stone!

** I'm honestly thinking that any form of immortality always has drawbacks to whoever achieves it. For instance, the horcruxes make the creator of them insane but grants them the immortality they desired(I'm not sure if that's actually canon if horcruxes makes the creator insane so sorry). So for the flamels they might be immortal but the drawback is the ageing process isn't stopped ‘tis making them frail and old looking.
