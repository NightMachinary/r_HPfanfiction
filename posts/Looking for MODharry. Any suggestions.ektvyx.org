  Death isn't good for the soul and dead things can't die twice.Harry dies too many times to be fine. After the war he goes travelling; he and Tom Riddle always were too much alike for their own good.

** YES! Two really good stories that deal with time travel as well as MOD if you don't mind: linkffn(Time to put your Galleons where your mouth is)

The Heir of the House of Black linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13391681/1/The-Heir-of-the-House-of-Black]])

The second is inspired by the first but goes a completely different way, it's awesome (Sorry about the links, I've been on reddit for 2 days, I know nothing)

**** True! But since the second fanfic is inspired by it, I thought it only fair to link both! And perhaps OP will like reading something slightly different. Personally, I enjoyed both, but I do have a preference for The Heir as the plot is just really well-thought.

** Linkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarCat)

The Hallows come into play in the second half of the story, after chapter 14, I believe.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
