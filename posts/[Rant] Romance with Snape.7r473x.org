Snape's character arc leads up to: Even after all this time? Always.

He had loved Lily for all this time. He isn't going to forget her in an instant to bang her son or his mudblood friend. That just doesn't happen.

The only way you can do that is to make Snape not Snape. Either by changing his childhood or making it very AU and explaining why he would be able to move on. You can't just have things happen from nothing. And honestly if you are doing all of that you may as well just make an OC.

Rant over.


** Sorry mate but "Always" does not mean "Only".

Most of us love multiple people in our lifetime. I only write post DH AUs, but to my thinking the downfall of Voldemort allows him to finally put away that chapter of his life and try and find a new life to live.

** This is my characterization of Severus Tobias Snape. He does everything he does for two reasons. Redemption, and revenge. He doesnt just want to beat voldemort because he cant exist in that world, he wants to voldemort dead for killing Lily Evans. He wants redemption because in his mind, he killed his best friend. He killed her! He allowed it to happen. Her son, her son with Lily's eyes stares at him constantly reminding him that in the end, he is the reason she is dead.

Romantically, he would never allow himself that pleasure. He would force himself into isolation. Yet he cant do that. Severus is not a good man. He handles his experiences wrongly. He lashes out. He fights. And he hates. Oh does he hate. He feels so much hatred and anger and suffering. He clearly does occlumancy because of it. He hates himself, he hates dumbledore for not saving Lily, he hates voldemort for killing her, he hates Harry for living and everyone else. He hates so much that he doesnt know what its like to not hate. But out of this hatred... He refuses to do anything less than the right thing. Because to do otherwise would bring pleasure to himself, and he doesnt deserve it. Because he killed her.

** I don't exactly disagree with you, but I don't think dramatically-different AUs are necessary. Superb characterization /is/.

Unfortunately, I've never read a Snape romance that I could believe 100%. He's either OOC to begin with, or quickly turns that way. The real showcase of skill would be writing Snape as the acerbic, unattractive asshole that he truly is, /then/ crafting a plot that would push him through enough character growth, self-awareness, and personal hygiene regimens to make him a plausible romantic interest.

Of course, that would take a lot more effort than just making him have sudden pants-feelings because of [insert slim justification here], so it has yet to have been done.

*** I definitely agree, it would require some serious skill and effort to have a believable romance arc with him. Considering the difficulty authors seem to have with portraying him as his canon self or in an even slightly negative way, I kind of think it may be next to impossible. The few fics that have come close to me have all been AUs.

There is a fic called linkao3(Hermione Granger and the Intended Vessels) [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/986751/chapters/1945220]] which I think captures him quite well if in a kind of messed up way. It is a marriage law fic with quite a bit of smut, a really bizarre premise (although a lot of things that seem really weird get explained in a logical way) and some seriously unhealthy interactions between him and Hermione. But it surprisingly manages to put a unique, almost realistic spin on a bad trope and has some great writing, humour, plotline and characterization that ends in mostly plausable romance, if not until the very end of the fic. Although mostly I think it just shows that Snape and romance just do not go well together.

** fanfics centered on Snape / someone else romantic pairing were a thing long before the last book came out.

so if you want to grok them, try to look at them from perspective of the fans with all their theories and maybes when books 4 to 6 were coming out.

I agree that now they look quite OC, but back than Snape was a gold-mine for fanfiction because all the fans had were several dramatic details and next to no road-map on how those link up.

An author could take him in any direction while still conforming to the relatively small amount of actual detail there was in canon.

By and large, if you are reading fanfiction that starts in Year X than the rule of thumb is that nothing from canon that happened or was revealed after the time point where the fic started, applies.

And Snape's character arc was revealed very close to the end.

******* I am a fan of Snape and believe that Lily was quite justified dropping their friendship. He was really into dark arts, friends with all the wrong people, wanted to join an evil organization that wanted people like her dead and was totally fine with them torturing and killing people. Even if he didn't call Lily a mudblood, I doubt they could have continued to be friends unless he stopped hanging out with future death eaters and didn't join Voldemort.

And while he may have had his reasons, mainly being messed up from an abusive home life, wanting to be accepted and become something more than a poor half blood in a house thats way into blood purity, power and influence, that doesn't really change the fact that he wasn't ever really a good person. It took killing the one person that he cared about to change his mind so I really don't think anything other than something similarly drastic would have changed him from his path when he was younger.

*** I don't blame him for his love not being reciprocated, I blame him for not accepting that. Of course, it's hard to do so at 15 years old, but he had five years to get over her before Lily died and then another 10 before Harry comes to Hogwarts.

I also blame him because he switched sides to protect Lily only. If he had realised that torturing and killing people his group perceived as inferior was wrong, Lily might have even forgiven him for the Mudblood incident.

I definitely also blame him for his behaviour as a teacher. Sure, he had a bad childhood, but that's no excuse for becoming a bully or for using a position of authority to bully.

**** i think a relevant question would be whether Volermort was including 15 year old new recruits into his torturing and killing sessions or even if such sessions were a thing at that point in time.

I kind of doubt he could go into full-Hitler mode from day 1 of forming Death Eaters and still get a lot of people following him.

In the real world, actual Hitler didn't, with all the most atrocious parts of their ideology coming out relatively late in his career.

And as many a fic pointed out regarding his behavior as a teacher - Dumbledore and Snape have always believed that Voldermort's return is only a matter of time. Snape was technically 'on the clock' in his job as a spy that needs to keep playing the role to both sides even in book 1.

***** Voldemort probably didn't go from 0 to 100 immediately, but he started his rise to power in 1950, with the war starting in 1970. Snape graduated Hogwarts in 1978 and presumably joined Voldemort shortly before or after that. So while Voldemort might have started out as only vaguely racist, he had plenty of time to go full on extremist before Snape joined.

Even if we assume that Snape only joined after graduating Hogwarts, he had more than a year of being a full on Death Eater before he overheard the prophecy and then a few more months before he knew Lily was a target. It's probably pretty safe to say that the muggle torture didn't put Snape off.

For comparison, Regulus Black joined the Death Eaters at 16 and began doubting Voldemort by the time he was 18. Kreacher was just the final moment for him to switch sides.

****** touche, though going by that comparison, Regulus Black was a pure-blood raised in this world, while Snape was a half-blood whose parents didn't use magic - meaning he came to Hogwarts as basically a muggleborn at a point in time when racial tensions were peaking and than sorted into the house that most valued blood-purity.

Than he was bullied for 7 years by the 'good guys'.

That's a pretty shit pie to get served at that age.

Not trying to make him into an innocent little white sheep here, but in my opinion when that's all taken together it's quite a lot of mitigating circumstances.

We don't know much about those years, but also consider that if (a) Voldermort and his followers were still relatively low key - thrice-the-outsider teenage Snape might have been plausibly misinformed.

if (b) Volermort and followers were already ramping up terror and persecution, than for thrice-the-outsider teenage Snape, the question of picking sides was actually a matter of life and death and by all accounts he was completely alone by that point. All authority figures he had at the time were borderline hostile as far as he knew - I doubt Slytherin house was overseen by a teacher that liked half-bloods in that political climate and Dumbledore was enamored and openly supportive of the quartet of bullies that targeted him.

******* I don't blame Snape for becoming a Death Eater, you listed quite enough reasons to do so, especially for an ostracised 15 year old. However, I do blame him for continuing to be one for 2-5 years without any remorse. The first time he shows some is when he asks Dumbledore for help because Lily is in danger. And even then, he only regrets making her a target.

Also, I don't buy him being a total outsider.

He came to Hogwarts with a good friend, a friendship he only lost in his fifth year. He also made friends within Slytherin despite not being a pureblood. His Slytherin friends are how he became a Death Eater in the first place.

Sirius' claim that he came to Hogwarts knowing a lot of dark spells and curses doesn't work if he grew up as basically Muggleborn. Snape also told Lily about the wizarding world before they came to Hogwarts, so he can't have been completely ignorant. We know nothing about his relationship to his mother, but the fact that he took her name (Prince) as his own suggests that it was positive.

There is no evidence for Dumbledore openly encouraging the Marauders. If Dumbledore didn't change his approach towards rivalries inside Hogwarts between Snape's and Harry's time there, he probably did nothing at all. The Marauders did gang up on him, but the bullying wasn't one-sided, just as the antagonism between Harry and Draco Malfoy wasn't one-sided.

Slughorn may have been dismissive of Snape's talent as a potioneer, but we don't know if (a) he didn't see any potential in Snape despite his talent for potions, (b) Snape ever showed off his knowledge in class and (c) Slughorn would admit to having Death Eaters in the Slug Club.
