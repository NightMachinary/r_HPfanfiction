---*This is a super underrated story.*---

/EDIT: It's not a perfect fic. There are issues with it. The reason why I recommend it is the fact writers deserve feedback./

I read this fic a long time ago around the time the author started to post this story. There was a lack of readers at the time too, so I tried encouraging the author with some reviews since the story was original and interesting.

I just came back recently to revisit the fic since it was in ever growing fanfic notifications I am slowly making my way through. (I was busy lately and had to put the fanfics in my email on hold.) So to my surprise, my kudos was still there. My *ONLY* kudos, that is. And the fic was posted back in *April* *2017*. I felt upset on the author's behalf because of the lack of kudos and readers for story. I may not be a very good writer, but I have posted some stories myself and even /those/ have some sort of response to them. If no one responded at all to my story, I would feel solely disappointed and probably wonder what I was doing wrong. Thus, my need to help the author out by sharing it here.

Always, now that I am done with my rant, off to my review. Despite being an AU centered around OC's, the story /is/ well plan and written. A basic summary from what I recall is that Tom Riddle also had a squib sister (whom Tom hated) and the sister had children of her own. A pair of those children are twins whom are the main characters. Every character is unique and have their own lives attached to them. The interactions between cannon and original characters are fluid and not at all forced. The storyline is definitely original so I could not predict what happens next. That is why this fic was enjoyable to me when I started to read it. The fic was different. So, I would encourage some people to try out the story. Not out of pity, but because the story is enjoyable as it progresses.

** Disclaimer: I have only read the prologue and chapter 1, and I really tried to like the story, but the writing needs improvement. It actually made me drop the story because it was hard to follow what was going on.

Here are some examples of weak writing:

--------------

The prose is weirdly lacking, just take the first sentence:

#+begin_quote
  "Tom! Please stop it!" Cried a small woman. She stood with a straight back. And the look of determination you could only find in Gryffindors.
#+end_quote

First, she (A /small/ woman) is begging. Then she has a straight back (huh?), and then suddenly a look of determination. Is she begging? Scared? Does she feel in control? The sentence contradicts itself, and not in a good way. And then it goes on:

#+begin_quote
  You could see emotions clouding her pretty and dark eyes. The woman faced a man wearing a black hooded cloak, seemingly the one named Tom. Lighting quickly flashed, illuminating their bodies.
#+end_quote

So her 'determined eyes' are suddenly clouded by emotion? Also, passive voice = weak. You can easily remove the seemingly (although I'd restructure the whole sentence).\\
"Lighting quickly flashed" -> As opposed to slowly flashing lightning?

Like, this is the start of the story! Put in some effort in the first two paragraphs!

--------------

Technical stuff is also wrong, like inconsistent tenses:

#+begin_quote
  Chloe *sat* in one of the cabins

  The Fowler twins *have* dark brown, almost black hair
#+end_quote

--------------

The dialogue is weak, using passive voice and not being clear at all.

#+begin_quote
  You know what he did to our mother. She was abused and beaten. Never given more than a thought. He didn't care that you existed until you graduated from Hogwarts
#+end_quote

For example, this alone could be written so much better:

#+begin_quote
  You know what he did to mum. Abused her. /Beat/ her. And you," he scoffed, "he didn't care you existed until after your graduation."
#+end_quote

I mean my version is far from perfect, but it sounds closer to actual dialogue and less like exposition.

--------------

And honestly, all of this makes it really hard to read, even if the story is okay.

*** Writing wise, I'll agree with you. I suggest commenting this directly to the author.

This is why I wanted to share this story. The author deserves some feedback to improve. Not necessarily because of a perfect fic. It is because itâ€˜s a story that a writer decided to share to gain input from others.

#+begin_quote
  A pair of Muggle-born fraternal twins start their journey to Hogwarts, School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. They make good friends, Chloe fights against others, Cole is scared of a certain professor, normal student things. But something is off. It's going to boil over one day, ruining relationships with friends and family. Ruining them. Ruining everything if they don't fix it, soon. (before reading jump to chapter 21! Please)
