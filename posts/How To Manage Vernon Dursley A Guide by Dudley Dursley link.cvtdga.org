:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Does anyone have a link or know where this fan fiction is located? I don't usually request fics because I like to find things myself but my search for this fic is legit impossible because I mostly get wiki pages for the Dursleys and Petunia Dursley in particular for some reason? Idk. Unfortunately I have no knowledge of who wrote it, or what platform it was written on. I know that's not really helpful. Any information would be fantastic at this point in my search.


** It looks like it's a part of [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/15025][Magical Relations]] by evansentranced linkao3(331625)

I found the phrase used to describe the fic in a fic rec roundup [[https://demifishblog.tumblr.com/post/174934242459/harry-potter-fic-recs-ii][here]] :

#+begin_quote
  Magical Relations is a series rewrite of what might happen if Dudley Dursley also got a letter from Hogwarts, including Slytherin!Harry to get away from Dudley, inter-house study groups, Hermione and Neville as The Best Gryffindors, sneaky sneaky Slytherins, *How To Manage Vernon Dursley: A Guide by Dudley Dursley*, so much character growth, and Harry's adorable crush on Padma Patil.

  Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. AU.Harry and Dudley's first year at Hogwarts. Highlights include bullying, subversive tactics, new friends, and misplaced magical objects.
