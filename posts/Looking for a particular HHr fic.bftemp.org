I'm looking for a fic I've read before but can't for the life of me find again. Basic plot is Harry and Ginny are together but unhappy and growing apart after a miscarriage, Harry and Hermione spend the night together and she ends up pregnant but doesn't tell him because he's still with Ginny. I also remember her staying at Hogwarts during/after pregnancy with Snape who is her friend Thanks


** If I am thinking of the same one is it where Hermione is friends with a Cupid and her grandparents come fown? Cause that'd be Hermione's Proposal.
