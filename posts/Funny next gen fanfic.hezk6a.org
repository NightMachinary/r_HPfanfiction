Lately I read this hilarious crack fic about Harry and his kids (plus Vic, Teddy and Scorpius) who find themselves in a alternative universe. It's not complete and it's not been updated for many years and possibly it won't be anymore.

The name is Scorpius Malfoy and the improbable plot. Someone please can tell me how to link the fanfic here.

It's the most hilariously, interesting, enjoyable reading about Harry Potter world in general I ever read. The author has made a story with such great humor and sarcasm and irony that I started to laugh at the first sentence to the last one they wrote. I read it years ago and I did again now - after all this time it's still the most funny thing I ever read.

And its the only fanfics where Albus being Slytherin is made acceptable.

I recommend it to read it alone or otherwise you'll seem a crazy person for how much you will burst in tears from laughing.

If someone already did, what did you think about it? And do you know something about the author or why the fanfic is not been updated for ages?

Most importantly if you know a fanfic written in a similar way with that humor, please recommend it to meüôèüôèüôèü•∫ü•∫!


** You should really try "A Black Comedy" same premise, and its not only hilarious but also quite entertaining and exciting!

  Scorpius really should have listened to his father's numerous and dire warnings about the Potter clan. Harry feels his pain. Gen crackfic WIP, yo. Seriously, so cracky.
