I love Harry's forgiving nature, but at times in canon I feel like he can be too forgiving. Everyone has their own breaking point.

I don't necessarily want a evil or dark Harry, maybe morally grey Harry?

I'd rather not have character bashing, How I define character bashing: No For The Greater Good Dumbledore, no Weasleys are using him for his money and fame and the like.

But him going off on Dumbledore for not telling him about the Prophecy earlier is acceptable, him getting angry at Ron for not believing that he didn't put his name in the Goblet of Fire and punching Ron or whatever is fine. (As much as I love Ron and the rest of the Weasley's), and stuff like that.

Harry can be smarter and powerful then in canon, but I don't want it to be too unbelievable. I don't want him to suddenly be Dumbledore powerful, or Hermione level of smart.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

No Harem Harry and no Lord Potter-Black-Gryffindor, et cetra Harry.

Can be on any site.

Harry doesn't have to be the main character, though he can, just as long as it follows (kind of), what I'm looking for).
