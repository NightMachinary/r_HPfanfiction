I'm not Team Everybody Make a Horcrux (actually, if you murder someone who's already made a horcrux, can that be used to make a horcrux? if so, it's at least worth considering...)

Anyway. I'm not saying it's good to murder people to ensure your own immortality, but in canon and in a lot of fics, it's seen as significantly more evil to murder someone and create a horcrux with that murder than simply to murder someone. Why might that be? How have you seen fics treat this that you thought interesting or appropriate?

The obvious options are that it removes your conscience, reduces your sanity, or the like. Have you seen any other arguments?


** I think the visceral horror comes not from what the wizard is doing to their victim but what they are doing to themselves. Your soul is your very sense of self and identity as well as your guarantee of spiritual immortality. To willingly endanger and damage it would be unfathomable.

*** That's the same reason I use for Avada Kedavra being unforgivable. There are other ways to kill people, but they aren't as reviled. For instance, one of the Famous Wizard Cards that JKR made was of Alberta Toothill. She was celebrated for winning a duelling competition by using a Blasting Curse on her opponent. The being celebrated part can be disputed, but she /won/ and got into a card.

It's the soul-splitting that makes Horcruxes and AK dark. They're willfully mutilating their very being.

That raises another question, is the intent to kill necessary for tearing the soul? Can I intend to kill someone, and miss, and still tear my soul? Can I accidentally blow a wall up on someone and tear my soul?

If so, making a Horcrux isn't necessary an evil act. Your soul is already in pieces, you're just taking advantage of the fact. It's amoral, but not immoral.

***** It's cold blooded murder, and even then it only fractures it. It's still all there, connected, and with time the fractures will heal. But making a Horcrux is the ultimate expression of "I am no longer Human". You are mutilating your soul in order to fight against the natural order of life and death.

It's basically the only example of Black magic in Harry Potter. It's a literal abomination of nature.

Making a horcrux without fracturing your soul would either do nothing or make the Cruciatus feel like a bee sting.

All you're doing is animating a corpse with Transfiguration magic, with maybe a few spells for preservation [All this is unknown. We don't know how it's done, btw]. You're not interacting with the soul of the freshly deceased, nor are you putting the soul of someone else into the corpse to bind them to your will.

Think of it like this: Killing someone is like getting a wound. It's bad, but given some time and appropriate treatment (regret, in this case) it may heal over, even to the point where there's no scar left. Splitting your soul to make a horcrux is getting a wound and then poking in it with your own knife until you manage to separate your body in two. It maims you forever, and the wound you are left with is a horrible one that's not likely to ever heal properly.

***** I have been thinking about this same thing! There have got to be other ways to take off pieces of soul and make Horcruxes besides killing people! Maybe a spell to use on yourself to damage your soul? Then you don't have to harm anyone to do it. It would be like people who do drugs and cigarettes, they are just hurting themselves and no one else so it is not illegal. Also, if you are a good person and you just hurt your own soul and make a horcrux benevolently, then your horcruxes would be benevolent! Not like voldemort's with the trying to kill hosts and stuff! Yours could maybe cheer people up and be there for them in hard times!

Now I have a character idea for someone who invents a spell to do that for themselves to get immortality, and they harmlessly make benevolent horcruxes. :)

** Hmm...well, I have my own personal idea of this, what makes soul splitting and horcruxes and stuff so evil. Please be aware that none of this idea is canon.

** 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section
   :END:
So my idea is, splitting a soul isn't evil; it takes some obscure magic to do it, but there's nothing ethically wrong with putting a sliver of your soul in a painting, a book, a loved one, a familiar, whatever, to imbue it with a bit of 'you'. Souls regenerate like starfish anyway.

But, putting a bit of your soul in an object doesn't make you immortal, for the same reason that George & Fred don't anchor each other to life; once the sliver of soul leaves you, it's distinct, it's nearly exactly like you, but it isn't you.

** 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section-1
   :END:
Now, souls can be damaged, not in the sense of splitting them, but in the sense of damaging their integrity; positive emotions like happiness, love, entertainment, etc, and doing nice things for others helps to strengthen the soul, but negatives like anger, hatred, fear, sadness, and hurting others cause it to weaken.

Dementors actually use this; the reason they bombard souls with negativity, forcing bad memories to the surface and twisting their victims, is in order to make the target soul weaker and easier to digest when they go in for a Kiss.

** 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section-2
   :END:
Anyway, normally splitting a soul isn't going to give you immortality...but, if a soul is damaged enough to the point of becoming 'petrified' (which is best accomplished by acts of supreme evil, e.g. cold-blooded murder or torture), then when a sliver is split off from it, those soul parts don't regrow and diverge; using sympathetic magic principles, those two soul bits can then be tied together, so that neither of them pass on if the other one still 'lives'.

Naturally, there's severe consequences to petrifying your own soul to make a functioning horcrux with it; a petrified soul means you don't grow as a person. You can learn new information, but you'll never overcome your flaws, you'll never improve as a person...the only way to recover is if you wholly reject whatever crimes you committed to petrify your soul in the first place ('remorse'), thus causing your soul to soften up again.

** 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section-3
   :END:
In a nutshell? Making the horcrux isn't evil, damaging your own soul to the point that it petrifies is the evil part.

...Alternatively, I came up with an idea once that a horcrux, as a receptacle for its creator's soul, wasn't intended to anchor its creator to life; rather, a horcrux was an anchor used by a summoned demon, that contained the soul of whomever summoned it.

Whereas normally a demon could be banished, by magic or by killing the one who summoned them, such a horcrux would make them immune to banishment, returning again and again until the horcrux is destroyed.

In such a case, the evil in making a horcrux would be sacrificing your life, and consigning your soul to eternal torture or complete annihilation, for the sole purpose of giving significantly more staying power to an agent of death and destruction and corruption.

** I think this sub doesnt understand the term murder that dumbledore uses. His tone is one of disgust and loathing... Much as what people who testified against Kissinger spoke as.

Murder doesnt mean you kill a person. Killing someone is just manslaughter. No. Murder, full backed murder is when you plan it, you relish in it, you do so fully knowing what you are doing. That is murder. And bluntly, Dumbledore is wrong. That isnt the most vile act. The most vile act, isnt the murder, its the feeling of elation and power you have over the life of your victim. It is for that reason that every single person who kills another doesnt automatically split their soul. The only one in canon that relishes in the death of their enemies other than Voldemort is Bellatrix. And post azkaban she isnt all there... To make a horcrux you must feel and love and crave the power and control that murdering someone grants you. I think that is why Voldemort never made more. After 6 times, it would be difficult to relish in the feelings of something you realize you can do so easily. After his formation of Nagini into a horcrux, it probably struck him that he couldnt actually enjoy it like he used too.

Murder doesnt tear your soul. Murder is the conduit to tear your soul. The feelings of elation happiness and joy from the destruction of another's mortal coil, that is what is soul splitting

** My guess is a difference of purpose and the soul.

Regardless of when, everyone dies. Whatever we believe happens after death happens. You can be a cruel human or a sociopath or neither and murder but you're going to die regardless (and as a Christian I'd say go and face God to answer for your actions and go from there)

When someone makes a horcrux they are deliberately defying the order. They are working towards immortality that is almost impossible to remove (unlike with vampires and other turned creatures). You have gone out of your way to split your soul (your religious/beliefs on this applies here) and have committed vile acts (see comment about JKR) to ensure your body is more important than life. Drinking unicorn blood is like frolicking with kittens in comparison to the severity of the horcrux.

** Just the act of murder alone does not create a horcrux... and it isn't just not feeling remorse for the murder either.

It has to be something extremely vile in the process for it to be so absolutely horrifying that almost no wizards even know that they exist, and that the ones who do have knowledge refuse to share it. The exception being Slughorn who very drunkenly (if i recall correctly?) and being manipulated told Tom Riddle. Not to mention J K Rowling, who isn't a usually one to shy away from detail, was quoted saying she wasn't sure if she could even bring herself to describe the process because it's apparently that awful to her.

So I'm guessing that the average person, and even the average murderer would shy away from this final act.

2. In OotP, Fudge and the Aurors in the Ministry recognise Voldemort, meaning that he looks the same as he did pre-resurrection.

** Possible reasons creating a Horcrux is considered an abomination, [even to people who are otherwise quite Dark, even in a Dark-is-evil paradigm]

- Immortal souls exist and there is an afterlife of some sort, so tearing your soul damages an eternal or sacred thing for a bastard form of the soul's immortality

- Immortal souls exist and there is an afterlife of some sort, and creating a Horcrux involves destroying or permanently maiming someone else's soul

- There is some background magic thing that makes people think Horcruxes are abominable for some reason.

- Magicals can sense magic to various degrees, and Horcruxes or people who have them just feel wrong, magically. In this case, there is some evolutionary biology reason that Horcrux-magic triggers fight/flight or disgust.

- There is a belief that making Horcruxes, or having them, causes some other thing that is horrible beyond anything else, but this is a false superstition.

- There is a belief that making Horcruxes, or having them, causes some other thing that is horrible beyond anything else, for example, the location where the Horcrux ritual is performed become a magic-null zone, or requires stripping the magic from a magical child, or something.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) provided a compelling reason.

Slight spoilers below for the fic: [[/spoiler][The Horcrux ritual is a form of esoteric magic, which requires not only the knowledge of the spell and the intent, but for you to maintain a certain mindset while casting the spell. In this case, the mindset is that there is literally no one on earth whose life is more valuable than your own. Since it's esoteric magic and it's a sustained process, this means that anyone who successfully creates and maintains a Horcrux must constantly hold this view, without fail. The only people who can do so are psychopaths (maybe sociopaths? I never understand the line between those); so, a Horcrux is a clear sign that you're dealing with a powerful, knowledgeable maniac. That's where the disgust (for those who know of Horcruxes) comes from.]]

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** My personal theory is that to create a horcrux, you not only have to feel no remorse for your eventual murder but also enjoy the murder and want to kill that person. If Harry killed Lucius Malfoy in the field of battle, he wouldn't necessarily feel bad about it, but he wouldn't enjoy it and he would still feel a tiny bit of remorse. The thing that doesn't make sense is that when Voldemort tried to kill Harry and when the Basilisk killed Myrtle. If killing is the only way to make a horcrux how is Harry one? And how did Tom Riddle make a horcrux with the murder of Myrtle? He didn't kill her, the Basilisk did. I think that killing opens some sort of gateway or something and it allows the horcrux to be created. You don't have to do the killing yourself, just know when somebody died.

Voldemort /had/ just murdered two people.

Or perhaps some level of complicity in the death is required? So if you accidentally let your cat out of your room and it startled a poor wee firstie who fell down the stairs and hit their head and died, you can use that to make a horcrux. If you happen across a traffic accident a moment after it happened and a pedestrian died, that might not work.

*** J K Rowling has stated that Harry was an accident and that voldemort didn't even know he made the horcruz because he never got to properly finish the ritual involved, so this tells me that it's definitely more than just murder and enjoying murder.
