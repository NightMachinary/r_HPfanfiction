#+TITLE: Harry has an appreciation for reading books. Not necessarily for learning new things (Though that can be apart of it as well), and nowhere near Hermione's level. But occasionally he likes to curl up with a good book

Not looking for Super Smart! Harry. Or a Harry that uses books to get smarter. Just looking for a Harry who will read stories for fun occasionally.


** Try this one. Harry actually started a little book exchange in it of fictional books he liked, and often quotes his favorite books, like Wind In The Willows. It's a pretty wholesome story with a Harry that actually gets to be a kid.

The Best Revenge

AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

** Now I'm imagining Hermione berating Harry, because he's spending all his time with his owl-ordered copy of the self-transfiguring "Big Book of Cuddles."

I imagine the staff would have priority for checking the self-transfiguring "Wizarding Kama Sutra" out of the Restricted Section.
