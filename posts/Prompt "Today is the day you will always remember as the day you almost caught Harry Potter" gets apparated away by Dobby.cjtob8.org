  Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Redone. Follow JKR plot, but Harry is calm, cool, & not cooperative. Harry finally living the role as popular. Parties, drinks, drugs, all the fun stuff in life. Complete. R&R.

  As Harry watched from behind elder Weasley's he put up his hands in rock-n-roll symbols and stuck out his tongue flicking it in a devilish way.

It's a humour fic written by someone with a juvenile sense of humour. I don't mind the crudity and bro-ishness, I mind that most of the jokes aren't funny. The ones that do land are decent though.
