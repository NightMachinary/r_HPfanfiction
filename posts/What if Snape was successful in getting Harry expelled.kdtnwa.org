This is a question that came to me while reading an anti-Snape post just now.


** Harry just goes to any of the other magical schools in the world i'm sure a lot of them would accept him, Harry would have a much better time away from Britain and Hogwarts without Snape and everything else that goes on in that school. I'm surprised he never looked at other options especially after what happened second year.

** I couldn't see Dumbledore allowing it though he might have to do something drastic e.g. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13279982/4/Harry-Potter-and-the-Burning-of-Bridges]])

#+begin_quote
  Collection of one shots where various Harry Potter characters will get more upset than in canon and end up saying or doing something that will likely destroy relationships, and possibly have long lasting plot impacts. Not meant to be bash-fic, but there will be some unforgiving interpretations of actions and words that will edge on bashing.

** I never understood Snape pursuing expulsion. Then what? Have Harry not under his and Dumbledore's protection? Great plan to insure the kid's safety, jackass.

*** He must have known that Dumbledore would never have done it, though. Also, if Harry was expelled then there'd be no need for Snape himself to remain at Hogwarts, presumably.

** I honestly don't think Snape is actually going to expel Potter. I mean expelling Potter will just make things harder for Snape. And I am pretty sure he knows that Dumbledore will not let that happen. Anti-Snap-ers should stop seeing things as black and white lol
