Wether it's Filch and Goyle, Molly Weasley and Xenophilius or Potter and Granger, doesn't matter. Purposefully, accidentally, whatever. Just looking for a pair of time travellers who mistakenly think that they're each the only one who has gone back.

And isn't Across the Time.

** Hermione Granger and the perfectly reasonable explanation has one time traveller, a second one is suspected.

Sadly the last update was quite a while ago. Still one of my absolute favorites.

Also seconding the non-fanfiction [[/u/monoc_sec][u/monoc_sec]] mentioned, Mother of Learning.

  In 1991, a child came to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with obvious gifts, but which few suspected would change the world... Oh, and Harry Potter enrolled that year as well. *** A few tweaks to canon, plus extrapolating Hermione's apparent intelligence realistically. I expect events to diverge fairly quickly. ;) *** cover image cc by-nc RooReynolds @ Flickr

  A change of events during the Horcrux Hunt; Hermione is sent to another dimension, trapped in Hogwarts during the Maruaders' seventh year- 1977. She has to wait for the winter solstice, when Harry will come, and the summer solstice, which will send them both back. Chapter 11 Edited.

** /More Than One Way to Skin a Cat/, by AverageFish: Snape dies from Nagini's bite but then wakes up in the infant body of Harry Potter and has to grow up as him. Dudley is acting weird, and it turns out he's the reincarnation of Harry Potter. Snape retains his full memories and powers; Harry, not so much.

  Severus remembered dying---that last hopeless look into Lily green eyes. Now he's back in the past, inexplicably in the infant body of Harry Potter. Oh, and there's something wrong with Dudley. Weirdness ensues. A different time travel fix-it. Likely the oddest Severitus you'll ever read. Inspired by Path of Decision---I See the Moon---Athey's Rebirth. Betad by Eider Down. Complete.

** Huh.... hot take - Filch in canon /is/ a time traveller, but we're playing by the “everything happens the same way because it already happened” rules of time travel. Which is why he's so bitter - he tried to change things early on, but everything happens the same way. Maybe his early actions even facilitated Voldemort's rise.

** Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches has 1 character who thinks they are the only time traveller, our protagonist who is a time traveller and knows about the first one and, it is suspected, a potential /third/ time traveller that neither know about. Fair warning, whilst the fic does have a lot of good things going for it the time travel + harem can be a very uncomfortable combination.

This recommendation isn't fanfiction, but [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21220/mother-of-learning][Mother of Learning]] is the best webnovel I've ever read. Regularly described as "Harry Potter meets Groundhog Day". There's the main pair of time travellers who quickly figure out about each other and a third, antagonistic, time traveller. Discovering the identity of the third time traveller is a major plot point for the first ~1/2 of the the story.
