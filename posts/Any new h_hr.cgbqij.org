** I've written linkffn(13147431) because I was not happy with the FwB stories around for H/Hr. Just some sweet feel-good moments, no smut, no drama.

If you are looking for something longer with more plot and less fluff, maybe try linkffn(13052802)

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

**** Any other information on which kind of fics do you prefer? More character development or more plot and action? More logical or more mystical worldbuilding? With or without Voldemort plotline?

My favorite H/Hr has a good different Voldemort subplot in the beginning followed by an original plot about Harry and Ron's auror career and Hermione's 'career', has a really slow romance, logical worldbuilding and great action and is from 2017-2018: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief)

***** If I had to choose, I prefer character development beyond anything else. I like the somewhat self aware Harry.

Definitely Voldemort Vs Harry centric. Definitely H/Hr, but it definitely doesn't have to obvious.

I generally like to read fics where Harry is canon age. I only like post-Hogwarts if it's a Harry who still hasn't beaten Voldemort or the Death Eater collection.

I'm really looking for another good showdown story. Nothing more than that.
