I have an idea for a general outline for a fic but i'm not talented enough to write the dialogue for it. I would love it if any of you talented writers decide to pick it up. Please pardon the length :P and take the time to read it. The story behind this idea is because I love Harry Potter and I love musical themed anime and stories, especially Your Lie in April and I was just thinking about how to mix some of the musical concepts in that show with the HP Universe. It seemed interesting also because of that quote by Dumbledore, "Ah, Music, a Magic Beyond All We Do Here!" . Admittedly, a lot of Kousei Arima's (Your Lie In April) attributes bleed into this version of Harry as there are already a lot of overlaps between them in the first place. Even the black hair and glasses are the same.

Beginning:

Petunia gets Dudley piano and violin lessons to raise him to be "a posh little english gentleman" and discovers that instead of her son, it is her nephew that seems to be a prodigy in the field of classical music. Pleased by this surprising fact , Petunia ropes her husband into making the necessary steps to develop his gift.

Harry's Music :

As Harry's abilities grow, his magic starts to manifest itself through his playing, allowing his listeners to see illusions(the masses do not know it's magic though) based on Harry's feelings and interpretation of the music. This magic also allows Harry's music to "touch the heart" of his listeners. By his 11th birthday, Harry has won countless music contests and is a world renowned piano and violin prodigy with concerts lined up. Prolonged exposure to Harry's music along with it strengthening his mother's protection eventually burns out the Horcrux in his scar prior to Hogwarts.

Dursley Situation :

- Petunia has been a good aunt since discovering her nephew's talents.
- Vernon only agrees begrudgingly at first, but Harry's music eventually touches his heart and he learns to treat the boy better. It also helps that Harry's talent starts paying dividends for the family ,financially and socially so he becomes proud of him.
- Dudley isn't raised to hate Harry and while there is a bit of envy (Harry is still a bit envious of Dudley for having living parents and a for being a "regular kid" , while Dudley is a bit envious of Harry's talent and fame) they generally get on quite well and are close. Harry's talent also pushes Dudley to try and find a talent of his own and hone it which turns out to be martial arts. He frequently ropes in harry into some of his exercises causing Harry to be more physically fit than average.
- Ultimately the Dursleys learned to love him.
- They haven't revealed it to Harry yet but they have an inkling as to the origins of the effects of Harry's music. Petunia and Vernon are both slightly more receptive to magic because of that but are still wary of the world that took their nephew's parents.

Harry's Situation :

- Harry loves music but is at the same time burdened with the pressure of being one the best in his field despite his age.
- His fame does not go to his head. He grows up well-adjusted and mature for his age. By age 11, he has learned to cope and deal with his fame as much as he is able to.
- Very media-savvy for his age. He appreciates fan mail and tries to reply to them whenever he can. He gets to know more about a particular fan through her letters(*wink wink) .
- Is social and friendly but can at times be awkward when among his peers. More at ease with communicating his feelings and thoughts via his music rather than words.
- Part of the appeal for his music, aside from the obvious magical effect, is its purity as well as the tinge of loneliness and sadness that colors it. This can be attributed to Harry's natural longing for his birth parents and the intrinsic loneliness of being an orphan. Also while he is generally content with his life, he can't help but feel that something is missing and that there is something out there waiting for him.
- He doesn't know about magic yet, but he does know that his parents died for his sake due to an overheard conversation between his aunt and uncle.

Harry's pre-hogwarts :

- Harry wants to take bit of a break from the music celebrity life and is considering cancelling all the concerts and recitals to focus more on his schooling for a while but just as he decides to tell his family of his decision, his Hogwarts letter arrives.
- The Dursleys try to keep him in the dark for a while, and comically goes through some of the lengths they went through in the original. Harry grows more and more suspicious about his aunt and uncle's odd behavior, especially when it escalates into a "vacation" to a shack in the middle of nowhere but they reassure him the everything is quite fine.
- Hagrid catches up to them and Harry learns the truth. At first he is livid but eventually calms down when his guardians explain that they wanted to keep him away from the world that took away his parents from him. They decide take a night to mull things over.
- Harry decides to go to Hogwarts and his guardians try to convince him otherwise citing all the things he has in the muggle world as a reason to stay. They eventually relent after a heartfelt explanation by Harry about how incomplete he feels and how he feels the need to learn about the magical aspects of his identity in order to fix that.

Harry in the magical world :

- Harry is not as put off by his fame in the magical world as in the original because of his experience with his fame as a musician. Again his media-savviness comes into play here and it helps him in more than a few incidents, primarily with helping Sirius get exonerated when the time comes.
- Muggleborn students know him more as a genius musician while the magical side initially has no idea about his fame outside of their world due to them being mostly clueless about muggle classical music. Halfbloods know both but have yet to fully reconcile that both are one and the same (with some of them thinking the 2 might be the same person but dismiss it as a coincidence more often than not due to the lore surrounding the wizard Harry Potter).

Harry in Hogwarts :

- Harry is surprised to meet Hermione, who he knows from her fan letters, on the Hogwarts express. Their relationship evolves from fandom to bestfriends over the course of time (more than bestfriends if you'd like :P) .
- At first the situation in Hogwarts is the same as in the original with house loyalty being as prominent and divisive(of the 4 different houses) as it is in the original but eventually Harry's charisma, good heart, musical and magical abilities, bridge the gap between houses and by the time final battle of hogwarts happen, the school is mostly united. Harry earns the love, admiration, and friendship of more than a few students from different houses with each trial every year.
- Harry always keeps his violin and piano handy through spells and artifacts. He has a penchant of knowing what piece of music to play and how to play them at the most opportune of times. An example would be if harry finds Luna one night depressed as a result of bullying from some in her house, and he knows exactly what piece to play to cheer her up and make friends with her. Admittedly this would need a bit of research and creativity on the writer's part on what pieces to play.
- Draco and the some of the Slytherins are mostly the same as in original during the beginning but eventually mellow out and become allies after being touched by Harry's music, especially appealing to his aristocratic and sophisticated side. Draco in particular is comforted by Harry's music at times when his overbearing father pressures him too much.
- Dumbledore is mostly the same as in the books but especially comes to enjoy the music and have faith in Harry's abilities.
- Snape cannot be openly goody-goody with Harry for fear of blowing his cover but cannot bring himself to be overly antagonistic towards him either after secretly overhearing him playing a song that gave the illusion of Lily's memories during a night where Harry was dealing with a bout of loneliness regarding his mother. Overall his perceived antogonism before the reveal of his true allegiance is heavily toned down and there are moments where the mask slips.

Anyways, there you go guys! Go crazy with it if you can. Again sorry for the length, you don't have to incorporate all of it down to the last detail but i would really appreciate it if you all can fit as much of it as you can. As far as pairings go, I enjoy multi pairings and other pairings but if it comes down to it, Harmony is the one I enjoy the most. Excited to see what comes off this if any, please do let me know if anybody comes up with anything. Feedback and discussion about the prompt itself is also very welcome.
