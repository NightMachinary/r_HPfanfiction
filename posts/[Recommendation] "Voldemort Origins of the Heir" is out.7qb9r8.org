** The production value is absolutely incredible, far better than I was expecting. It's just a shame the accents and acting are so cringey.

** I feel a bit bad about shitting on this, but apart from the fact that they had good equipment and neat sfx, everything else is terrible. The premise, the dialogue (writing in general), acting, the dubbing...

*** I don't fully agree. It's not just the equipment and effects, the /cinematography/ itself was pretty good... and I, for one, rather like the premise and ending-twist. The sets were pretty nice. The dialogue is what it is because as far as I can tell, none of the crew were native English speakers, but it's not /that/ bad, and the same goes for the acting (not great, but there's no Tommy Wiseau in there).

**** I wouldn't call basic shot/reverse shot and 4572 closeups of eyes pretty good cinematography.

The premise expanded a little (very little) on Voldemort's acquisition of two Founder relics. Everything else was Voldemort-in-disguise talking to some Russian about things we already knew, so actually that whole interrogation thing added nothing, not even compelling worldbuilding...

Nice locations, I'll give it that. But then they try to pass a 20-something off as a 12 year old and all the set appreciation goes outta window. All they had to do was make Grisha closer to 17 in the flashbacks.

Plenty of people who write great stuff in English aren't native speakers, I don't find that to be a compelling excuse for terrible writing.

The film is called "Origins of the Heir", but we got more of the relationship between the other 3. Riddle just sneered at everyone. For a thing named after him, he was very uncompelling in it. And if Tommy Wiseau is your benchmark for bad, then Keanu Reeves must be an Oscar contender. Acting was bad.

I'll give a point for trying to do something mildly interesting with the Ravenclaw heir, but only a single point, because tattoos and eyeliner do not a character make.

  The premise expanded a little (very little)
#+end_quote

I wouldn't call things "There were secret Heirs of the other three Founders, they met up in the RoR and that's why it was an important and Horcrux-worthy location for Riddle" and "The Diary was originally hidden somewhere in Europe and giving it to Malfoy was a fallback" very little.

** Amazing production value and CGI for a fan film, but the story and dialogue were absolute crap. Doesn't really get you invested in any of the other heirs or go into Voldemort's mind (which I hope it did). Also, what happened to Wiglaf and Grisha finally?

Not a patch on the Dumbledore v. Grindelwald fan film or Severus Snape and the Marauders. Pretty disappointed overall, although the actor for Tom was pretty great.

*** Unless I really misunderstood the final scene very much, the real Grisha tracked down the old location of the Diary Horcrux, where Voldemort ambushed her and killed her. It's her corpse the Russian Aurors uncover.

**** Yeah I figured that, but I wish they showed the final battle between the two, or at least had a flashback where Grisha tries to track him down and he kills her. Now I'm just left thinking that the entire thing was a story he made up to get the diary back.

***** You're /supposed/ to think that. The ending /does/ leave it ambiguous whether any of the story Riddle told was true at all beyond there being such a person as Grisha McLaggen.

** Why does she literally look like the Flash from my favorite comic book TV show the Flash on CW? She has orange lightning and superspeed!!! Or is it supposed to be apparation? Or is she taking an increased agility potion or something?

*** It wasn't her, it was Voldemort. I thought it was some super apparition at first, but then he did at Hogwarts. He also alluded to super awesome magic techniques he learned thanks to Dark Arts, so I'm assuming they meant to leave it unexplained to show how badass Voldemort is.
