:END:
I've been trying to find this fic for a day or so with no luck.

Essentially it's a oneshot where someone calls out Hermione about the parchment, someone saying something about "never signing something without know what they're signing" or something similar. Hermione then reveals she jinxed the parchment, and people start questioning her reasoning/methods.

Any help would be appreciated!


** Can't do a full search right now because I'm at work but im 99.9% sure it's Daphne and Tracey who question it, if that helps at all

*** I remember Daphne showing up at the end with an alternate contract that didn't result in the SNEAK pimples, so we're on the right track. I just can't remember the name! ðŸ˜‚

****** It's very rare, but occasionally he does them. Like that one where Deadpool becomes Filch's assistant (at least I don't THINK there's any smut in that one).
