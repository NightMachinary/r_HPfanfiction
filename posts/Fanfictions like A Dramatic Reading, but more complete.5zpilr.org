[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12324284/1/A-Dramatic-Reading][A Dramatic Reading]] is about Umbridge finding the books and reading them out loud to the student body, basically. It starts off with an author's note saying that they've seen that plot as a trope before, but this is the only one of this kind that I've seen. What others like this are there (preferably complete, or at least more complete than A Dramatic Reading)?


** It's not really like A Dramatic Reading, but [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8553100/1/The-Rise-and-Fall-of-Harry-J-Potter][The Rise and Fall of Harry J Potter]] is also inspired by the 'Reading the Books' trope and is 'technically' more complete (it's on to Chamber of Secrets at least).

  All was well. Truly, it was. Harry Potter was so happy that not even Rita Skeeter's newest biography could spoil things. Okay, fine, so maybe he'd 'forgotten' to mention parts of his past to his loved ones. It wasn't like this disaster could end in Azkaban sentences or pygmy puff invasions, right? Right. He was worrying about nothing. --- Pre-Epilogue, canon ships.

  Umbridge finds seven books about Harry Potter from another dimension in the Room of Requirement and decides to read them aloud to the school in an ill-advised attempt to discredit Dumbledore. Hilarity ensues. Features an actual plot, realistic reactions, decent pacing, *and minimal quotations*.

** There are quite a few if you look around on fictionhunt, where purged stories somehow survive...

None of them are particularly good though, and seem to get abandoned before Umbridge get what's coming for her.

** Assuming you only want Harry Potter stories and ones that's aren't ... well, unilaterally bad, the short answer is “nope” and you probably know what the long answer would be.
