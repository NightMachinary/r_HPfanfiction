*** Well if I remember correctly, Harry doesn't take Draco's body but Ghost Draco taking his old alive body after following Harry through a time portal (or something of sort).

***** Oh nice thanks. I'll check this out. GraeFoxx was also doing his/her version and until recently (s)he was updating quite regularly. I don't know if it's on hiatus, abandoned or just in research of inspiration. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13025350/1/From-Ruin]]
