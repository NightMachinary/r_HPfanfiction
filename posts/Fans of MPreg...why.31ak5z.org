** Fans of forced marriage fics...why?

Fans of harem fics...why?

Fans of creature fics...why?

Fans of femHarry fics...why?

Fans of teacher/student fics...why?

And the list goes on...

The answer, as always, is /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3096379/1/First-Encounter][because]]/.

*** That first link you provided us is like a sordid HP fan fiction combination of rickrolling and tubgirl or goatse.

But yeah, you're right, it's like people have different tastes in what they enjoy reading.

*** Hey, there are good Fem!Harry fics out there. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home][A long Journey Home]] is one. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] is another.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4464089/1/Yellow-Submarine][Yellow Submarine]] has a well done teacher/student relationship between Harry and Ginny. They have nice hot sex on the teacher's desk, just like every good teacher/student story should.

The Firebird Trilogy is a pretty good Harem fic.

Forced marriages can be done well. /Prince of the Dark Kingdom/ had a forced marriage going between Hermione and Crouch Jr.

Creature fics? Does werewolf!Harry count? There are quite a few of those.

All of these ideas can be done well. There is nothing inherently wrong about any of them. Mpreg on the other hand....

**** Mine was an artistic statement of rough equivalence, not a condemnation.

I see mpreg fics as simply being from an AU 'verse where (some) men can do something...odd, not an author confused on "how is babby formed" being a massive pervert. More porn-sci-fi than perversion of nature.

It is no less valid (if slightly less "realistic") a fantasy than a teenage boy being magically "forced" to marry seven nubile young witches or a lust-crazed Veela, or /being/ a lust-crazed Veela, or a student having the magical soul-binding hots for a teacher (add Veela as required), etc.

** My biggest problem with mpreg is that it completely kills the suspension of disbelief. I can believe in a lot of stupid shit, this is about /magic/ after all, but there are limits. I can buy cross-species mating, because that would explain Centaurs, and through Hagrid and Flitwick it's even canon. But mpreg is /literally/ unbelievable. /Tony Stark/ fits better in the HP universe than male pregnancy.

Also, when the plot points are about sexual practices that I don't ship that become a too large part of the story, then I lose interest. I'm not heavily into domination stuff, so any fic with Dom!Someone or Sub!Someone I just ignore. The more detailed your description is of non-mainstream stuff, the more likely it is to turn the majority of readers off. What's next, /Harry Potter and the Golden Showers of Professor Snape/? (Somewhere, someone just started to write a new HP fanfic.)

The fanfics are about the Harry Potter universe. If you want to introduce weird non-canon stuff it has to 1) actually fit in, and 2) be well written. Which usually means no slash, because most slash is just /very badly written/. Sirius/Remus usually works, Harry/Snape or Harry/Draco usually doesn't. /Friends/ have hot, steamy sex, enemies do not.

/Why/ is Harry a girl in your fic? Is there a /good reason/? If you just want to write hot, steamy sex with [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants][Draco in Leather Pants]] then, honestly, Gay!Harry is much more believable than Fem!Harry. Even then, Ron/Draco is still more believable than Harry/Draco or Hermione/Draco.

If you're a female writer who wants to write a self-insert fic with LeatherPants!Draco, write from the viewpoint of a Slytherin girl, because that's actually believable. If you just want to write hot, steamy sex, then perhaps you should do so [[http://www.literotica.com/stories/][somewhere else]].

Yes, I feel better now.

** It's because Jim Butcher pulled it off in his /Dresden Files/ series. No, seriously, when a guy can pull a protag riding a zombie T-rex down Michigan Avenue as his sidekick blams away on a polka beat, you just know that whatever he might choose to put down in ink (including mpreg) has to be made of awesome. They just want a piece of that.

******* Better add them to your reading list. (The last book was actually quite good, better than the two before it.)

Jim pulls it off plausibly in the context of his story. (And it's been foreshadowed in the novels you've read.)

** Because shortcuts, for poorly planned stories and badly written plots.

It's the "I can't really fit this into my story so I'm going to steamroll my way into doing it anyways" mentality.
