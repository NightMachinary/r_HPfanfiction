If you had to name HP cannon characters to have superhero names what would they be?

â€‹

like what would you name Harry? or Draco?

I feel like Kronos is a good name for Harry, seeing as he manages to get things done in an impossible amount of time in Fanfiction.


** Given how superheroes get their names from their traffic story, I think that this is rather obvious:

The Scar

*** That's pretty good, but kinda obvious. Like Prongs being Harry's dad. Although it could work if Harry was like Ironman.

**** Considering everything that happened during the books, the overall success of his plan in 6th year, surviving the war, and ending up generally unscathed by the end, he was pretty lucky huh? The golden hair is a sign....

** Well given that superhero names are often reflective of identity, philosophy or power (besides being stupid sounding most of the time):

-Disarming Deer - Harry (because stag don't alliterate)

-Colourful - Dumbledore

-Mirror - the twins, add cracked/stained/whatever to get the Patil

-The Greatest Crimson Student - Seamus (because an Irish student who likes explosions would like Megumin)

-Library Girl - Hermione

-Magizoophile - Hagrid (he don't understand the sad implications of the name)

-Tartan Cat - McGonagall

-Inconsistency - Rowling

** Hermione has a secret identity as "Night Nargle" in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief), but the name was invented by Luna and the Prophet ran with it but she really doesn't like it. After all, she did all the effort to become a Cat Burglar and now her villain name isn't about cats?

#+begin_quote
  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
