Looking for Fanfics where Harry is raised elsewhere to the Dursley's and Magical Britain and returns at the Triwizard Tournament or later


** I LOVE these kinds of fics so I've got tons. Some of these might be slightly different than what your looking for. I tried to filter out all the ones where Harry comes first year or doesn't go at all but I'm not sure I got all of them. I'm pretty sure I liked most of these but I think I may have saved a couple of these just so I could laugh at them later. Just a warning.

I've probably got a few more saved somewhere but I can't find them right now.

** It's a James Spookie fic, so it's not for everyone, but linkffn(The Fourth Champion by James Spookie) is one.

There's a fic called linkffn(The Katarn Side by Darth Marrs) which suffers pretty much all of Darth Marrs' usual failings, but isn't as good as the few HP fics previous to it. Worth reading just because

A) Fuck yeah Kyle Katarn

B) The Chuck Norris-style jokes at the start of each chapter.
