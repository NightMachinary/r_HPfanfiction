I recently started reading *Hail Odysseus*, linkffn(10645463) and I like the core concept. However I honestly found it a bit too edgy for my tastes.

I generally enjoy grimdark fictions, but the idea that Hogwarts has a house(Slytherin) that allows rape as a means of "breaking in" half-bloods is a bit too much for my suspension of disbelief, among other things.

So I'm looking for a well written Grindelwald fic. Preferably one where Gellert tutors Harry to some extent.

I'd like to read a fiction set in the regular timeline of HP, but if you know of a truly amazing one set in an alternate time period, please let me know.

Thank you for reading.


** It certainly /tries/ to be edgy. It just comes across as stupid, because Brennus wouldn't know what to write if half of his characters weren't ridiculous caricatures.

Gellert tutors Harry in linkffn(Escape to Darkness). It has its faults, but worth a read IMO.
