** I can't say most of these are good, because I've only read some of them, but they're what I have.

Vahan is one I haven't read, but it's apparently very cold and brutal.

Deprived is a classic John Wick-esque Action B-Movie of a fic. Quite fun, though not exactly high literature. :D

Triton, I've read a bit of, but lost interest. Kind of a cross between Deprived and Charon.

Imagine if Blaise Zabini's mother was an Assassin's Creed type assassin, and imagine if that sort of person raised Harry. That's basically this fic. Again, I started it, but never finished it. It's on the list though, I just ran out of time.

Azkaban Harry gets hired to kill Voldemort. That's about all there is to say about this, really.

  Mercenary, bounty hunter, assassin, and now apparently a bodyguard. That means having to go back to a place and deal with things I don't want to. WBWL story. Pairings as of yet are undecided, might not be any written. It's kind of a slow burn.
