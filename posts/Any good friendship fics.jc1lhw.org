I can't seem to find any fics of just... people being friends. The Golden Trio, Draco, the Weasleys, I don't care. I just want friendship. Hurt/comfort is always nice but not a necessity.


** I would categorize [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6243892/1/The-Strange-Disappearance-of-SallyAnne-Perks][The Strange Disappearance of SallyAnne Perks]] as more of a mystery slice of life, but it could definitely suit your needs. No pressing overarching plot, just Harry and Hermione solving a small mystery in the castle together. Hope you enjoy!

** linkffn(Recnac Transfaerso) has a looooot of angst and abuse but the friendship between the Golden Trio is so sweet. I usually can't take overly abusive Dirlseys or overly self-sacrificing Harry but idk something about this fic got me.

linkffn(The Best Revenge) has a lot of great friendships and Hufflepuff Harry being friends with people he wasn't friends with in canon.

  In a rash act of self-sacrifice, Harry saves a dying Muggle by magically transfering the man's cancer to himself. Now, going through his fifth year with a terrible secret, he begins to realize just what he's given up. H/G, R/Hr. Warning: abuse

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.
