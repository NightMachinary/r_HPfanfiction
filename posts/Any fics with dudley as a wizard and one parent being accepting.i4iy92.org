I looking for a fic where dudley gets a hogwarts letter along with harry. And then it turns out that petunia or Vernon (either or but not both) were just following the example of the other in terms of abuse neglect if harry. But when the abusive one is out a recovery and healing process both kids go to hogwarts and the like.


** Bonus if Vernon is the accepting one.

** For future reference, this post ought to be tagged "request". The "recommendation" tag is intended for when you want to recommend a specific fic, while "request" is meant for asking for a recommendation based on certain criteria.

Anyway linkffn(3446796) "Magical Relations" fits the bill, I know Vernon is accepting and I'm pretty sure Petunia isn't.

  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year. *Reviews contain SPOILERS!*

  Petunia Dursley has trouble: she's lost her family, she's going crazy, she can do magic (but not always), her suitors are a mixed bag (operative word) & people keep trying to take her children away from her. They should be very afraid. (Not only a) Double Severitus. WARNING: Not what you expected.
