So I'm writing a story where Harry is going to end up pretty differently than in canon, in terms of interests and goals (even in coping mechanisms). In canon, I always assumed he was so into Quidditch starting out because it felt freeing after being a prisoner at Privet Drive for ten years. But the Harry I've written ran away early and can do some magic before Hogwarts, so I don't think he'd have that kind of immediate attachment to the sport. And because of a certain traumatic incident, he won't end up being interested in becoming an Auror (although that career choice felt odd in canon too).

It got me thinking that maybe some of my readers might not like these eventual divergences. When is Harry in a story too different for your tastes? Is it when his hobbies and career are altered, or is it when his personality is changed? I can usually tolerate some amount of change (preferably if the difference is explained or shown why it's that way), but stories where he becomes edgy or too full of himself are instant drops for me.


** As long as Harry Potter is his name I'm good, but I do start to get put off when Harry goes along with everyone he meets and their beliefs. As long as Harry remains a strong-willed character you should be fine.

** Being too angsty. I find that canon Harry developed a sort of emotional pragmatism (others would maybe call that being emotionally stunted). Harry just didn't emotionally invest in people, as a general rule, with very few exceptions. So I don't see him becoming paralyzed by grief by, for example, a death of some person he knew.

That's not to say that you shouldn't include such moments about the few people he valued, but they should serve a greater purpose and they should be poignant and /powerful/.

** Eh, I think with the protagonist you have the most free reign in comparison to other characters (because it's usually easy understood why he acts and thinks differently, he gets a chance to explain himself).

If you even change his upbringing your options are almost limitless... I'd only expect you to keep the most basic characteristics and stuff that can be attributed to nature instead of nurture (People-saving-thing, hot-headed, outspoken and honest). I'm not even dead set on canon!Harry becoming an Auror or playing Quidditch for the rest of his life, so I certainly won't have a problem with an AU!Harry doing none of these things.

*** This is a difficult line to walk because Harry ought to be affected by years of abuse, if not outright torture (the cupboard). I am not advocating a mopey, spineless Harry here, but everyone has a breaking point. And having a Terminator-like Harry with 0 emotions is almost as bad as those suicide angst fests.

In my own stories I went with different approaches to this. One had Harry (aged 13) break down after seeing some family pictures with him in, the other has Harry as a perfectly functional young adult who has some insecurities around women without going too deep down that hole either.

** I don't care much for how "different" he is. It's fanfiction. It's bound to be different in some ways.

I just want him to be consistent with those "differences", if that makes sense.

For example, I hate angst, almost never read it, but I read through the entire "Behind Blue Eyes" fic. It's choke full of angst, and even in the happier moments, the atmosphere is still so heavy. However, the portrayal of the characters was consistent.

In another story, however, Harry was first portrayed as having some sort of PTSD from the abuse. It was so bad that he went all stiff and flinched whenever his friends (a.k.a future love interests) touched him. But when the plot dictated, he got all angry and confrontational, even resorted to swearing and physical violence because, apparently, he "hated bullies". I would be fine with this if it was some kind of mental disorder that made him act that way. Too bad, given how his friends reacted to that little stunt, it wasn't what the author intended, Harry was just that inconsistent.

** "Too different" is rarely a problem for me. "An annoying little shit" is usually my problem, because I don't want to read about people like that for fun.

I should also note: when the differences don't have an impact, it's waste of text to include them. If you make Harry a girl and this has no impact on anything that happens to her, you've failed to create an interesting premise.

** It's definitely more personality to me. (I mean basic behavior and not morals, BTW.) The thing is that personality can affect hobbies and careers. I always felt like Harry became an auror because it's not in him to sit back and let other people do the fieldwork. He wants to help and so he's going to go out and do it. This is why I've never really liked fic where he's a Quidditch player or a teacher. He doesn't have to be an auror but being uninvolved with current events or preparing others to go out in the field when he won't be... It just doesn't feel like him to me.

Another thing is that a lot of authors write him differently to try to fix something about him (more academic, more politically aware, etc.). That's not necessarily bad but, in taking away flaws from canon, they leave him without any. They didn't replace those flaws. It results in a Harry that is very bland.

*** Good stuff. My issue with the Auror thing was that in canon, it came across as two things: Wanting to stick it to Umbridge and more of a "Well I guess I'll do this cause I'm good at it" sort of thing. He didn't seem to sure about it (common problem obviously). That said, I don't plan on making him a teacher or Quidditch player!

Yea I don't like writing Harry that way, it's a bit too boring. Especially since it's often combined with shooting his powers through the roof.

**** I'm not so sure I agree on your logic on Harry becoming an auror in canon. Those statements/thinking were from a 14/15 year old Harry. By Book 6, he's far more interested in it. Based on that, and the fact that Harry does go through development off screen, it's safe to say he was probably sure about his career choice.

The last bit I wanted to touch on. I always thought there was this fanon feeling that Harry fought Voldemort because it was "expected" of him, and he became an auror because it was "expected" of him after defeating Voldemort. But, in the books, Harry /wanted/ to fight Voldemort, prophecy or not, because it was the right thing to do. Harry has a strong justice of right and wrong, as well as a nose for trouble, and a natural investigative sense. Keep in mind that he became the youngest Head Auror in history at 26, I don't think it's a stretch to say that he both liked being an Auror and was very good at it.

I've gotten wayyy of track, but yeah, those are my two cents on Auror Harry.

Well, yea, I did mention the sticking it to Umbridge bit, which was when he was 14. :) My point was that at the time, it felt odd and more based on his skill at it than any inherent interest at that time. It's a pretty common problem at that age of course.

Harry didn't really seek Voldemort out until the end though. As you say, it really followed his inclination to right wrongs around him, it was always (OoTP aside) an unexpected consequence of what he was doing.. I mean, in CoS he seemed fine planning to tell Lockhart to go defeat the Basilisk, and I'm not sure adding "Voldemort is behind it" would have changed that.

What a terrible sentiment. Being a teacher isn't just sitting back and letting others do the fieldwork. Maybe as a teacher he can be a positive influence on the next wannabe Dark Lord and prevent his rise alltogether instead of defeating him in battle. Maybe he can teach students how to protect themselves instead of catalogueing their corpses and investigating crime scenes as an Auror

Even a poet can possibly do more for peace than an Auror. Write a compelling story like Harry Potter and stop pure-blood bigotry in its tracks.

**** You took what I said as something disparaging toward teachers when it was never meant to be. Good teachers do prepare you to go out into the world. They obviously don't follow you. Their role is to prepare, whether that's with knowledge or inspiration/direction/etc. A good teacher does have to step back at that point and trust they've learned what they need.

However, just because it's a worthy career doesn't mean everyone wants it or would fit it. I don't think Harry could train other people to fight the Dark Arts without feeling like he should be out there doing it and preventing it from ever reaching his students. That's how he thinks. He's an investigator. Not a poet.

***** No I think you're disparaging Harry by betraying him as some kind of Rambo-type character who doesn't appreciate the usefulness (and possibly superiority) of other types of fighting. He has shown an incredible talent for teaching in the DA and I think it's insulting to say he wouldn't consider teaching to be worthwhile.

EDIT: The way I see the character, he would not be happy as a teacher, at least not for a long time after the war. It doesn't mean he's not capable. It doesn't mean he doesn't appreciate teachers. It doesn't make him Rambo to prefer entering law enforcement.

** There is not a single thing where I would say "Harry has to have that trait", because there is a way to plausibly explain every change, from Harry being a pureblood bigot (he was raised by the Malfoys) to him being a ruthless Death Eater hunter who would make McCarthy look like a schoolboy (Hermione used emotional blackmail along the lines "Do I have to die before you start fighting them for real? Is my life the price that needs to be paid?"). It might not be the best or most popular story, or capture the same spirit as the original series, but you can come up with a plausible explanation for everything.

My interpretation of the Auror career is that Harry thought he would be one to fight Voldemort because he did not expect a takeover. Being an Auror would be one of the best ways to fight Voldemort from a position of power. It was also sticking it to Umbridge.

I hate the post-war stories where Harry is an Auror because he already gave more than anyone else for the good fight. He ought to have some peace and happiness, not his own Law and Order series.

As for Quidditch, it was either join the team or face consequences for disobeying Hooch. Mind you, expulsion was probably an exaggeration, but I don't think that polishing toilets with Filch would be much fun. And his housemates would see that as treason as well.

I have seen fics where Harry changes his name because "Sirius was more a parent to him than his actual parents."

** Quiddich was the only thing that Harry was respected and admired for that he actually liked doing. What were his other claims to fame? First, he was Boy-Who-Lived, which was about death of his family and nothing he chose for himself. Later, he was the "Chosen One", fighting Voldemort and expected to defeat him, and that involved nothing but pain and danger to him and to his friends. So, even if he were raised by some friendly foster parents, he would still have reasons to love Quiddich just as much.

As for what makes Harry too different for me, it's hard to say, because Harry as he is in canon isn't a very interesting lead character (to me). On the other hand, fics that rewrite Harry to be more thoughtful, studious, and driven feels like stealing the protagonist's spot from Hermione and Gary Stuedom, because this new Harry rarely acquires any flaws in the process of being "improved".
