Jesus Christ. I dont think there are any spoilers here but that really depends on what you define as a spoiler. Let me start by saying I do actually like the story so far. I'm most of the way through the first book and I'll probably finish the whole series but I really just wanna complain a little bit so here I go.

Almost all of the adults in this story are fucking awful. They are unnecessarily cruel. They do not know how to interact with children. They lie with impunity and then dish out punishment when they're called on it. They are physically, mentally, and emotionally abusive towards students. They use punishments that are cruel and unusual that have been proven to be wholly ineffectual and traumatizing to developing minds. The sheer tsunami of condescension and arrogance they display is driving me crazy. Like, of fucking course these kids are going to act up with the way you treat them. Monkey see, monkey do. It's no wonder that these kids are so fucked up and disrespectful if this is the example they are led by.

Maybe some of my feelings are coming from a place of little experience dealing with children and other adults who are in charge of children, but I know for a fact that is not how you treat a children. Like it's not a secret that kids are stupid, but when they ask a question being an evasive dick is not the correct response. I mean half the things that Alexandra gets up to in the story so far wouldn't even happen if the adults in her life would just be a little bit honest with her, if they just reciprocated the respect they believe they are owed.

I guess that's really all I have to say. What do you guys think? Am I crazy or are the adults in this story crazy?

If there turns out to be a reason that all the adults are so fucking terrible don't tell me lol, or at least mark it with a spoiler tag.


** I've tied this one a few times because it's a pandemic, I'm bored and I need giant things to read. And I honestly can't just read it. I don't enjoy the tone or the characters or anything about it.

Good luck with it!

*** Sounds like you gave it a fair try, but just in case others are reading I'd like to put this out there: Alexandra starts as a very unlikeable person and evolves into a very likeable person. It just takes many many words to get there. For me her character development felt incredibly earned.

**** The pandemic will probably be another year where I live so eventually I'll get that desperate.

I read HPMOR so anything is possible

***** Ha! I haven't gotten around to HPMOR yet! Maybe that should be my New Year's Resolution, since I'm also planning for another year of pandemic.

** Sounds like your complaints are largely about Lilith Grimm and the Charmbridge staff. Inverarity has said a couple times over in [[/r/AlexandraQuick][r/AlexandraQuick]] that he regrets the way he presented her in the first book; I think he said that he meant for them to be somewhat incompetent, but not abusive, and Lilith in particular very much reads as abusive.

If it's any comfort, the "relationship" between Lilith and Alex is somewhat developed in the next couple books, and the context of her actions in the first book is certainly taken into account.

As for Claudia and Archie, there's a reason for the way they treat Alex, but that's revealed in later books.

** Its darker. Alex is an not immediately likable, or at least not Harry. I think of it as a better version of all those edgelord Dark Potter (with amazing world creation). Keep going.

** There is something of a reason from what I remember. But even then the vibe I got was it might be intentional to show flaws in the magical world and things like that

** Trying to be as vague as possible with the spoilers. In later books, Alexandra meets a better quality of adult, and many of the adults she already knows reveal depth that doesn't necessarily come through in the first book.
