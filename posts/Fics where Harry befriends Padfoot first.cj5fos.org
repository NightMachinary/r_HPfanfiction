I really liked "because he strayed across the path" by LullabyKnell linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8517286/chapters/19522336][8517286]]) that has Harry really loving this stray dog before he meets Sirius. I'm wondering if there are any other fics out there with a similar dynamic.


** It kinda happens in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path). Harry and co are not amused when they find out who their pet actually was.

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.

*** I saved this to come back to later... to find that this fic, which I read years ago, is the only response, is disappointing
