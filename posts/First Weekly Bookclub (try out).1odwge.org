This story was picked from fanfiction . net, using the filters all complete adventure and sorted by most favoritited, and is was the first pure adventure. I have not read it, but I'm sure some of you have.

I will make a discussion thread next Friday, with some opening questions/thoughts on it and we can all have a go and see if this book club works :)

Edit: Hi all for this first week (because this fic is so large) please read to minimum of chapter 20 for the discussion on Friday, thank you.


** I'm fine with this as a first try out, but I suggest that for future installments there be a nomination/voting thread to determine what story is discussed.

**** I suggest that there be a nomination thread where people can nominate stories to be read, and upvote the nominees that they want to read. The next day, there would be a voting thread, in which the top three entries from the nomination thread are voted upon.

** What's our goal reading amount? I know book clubs are like, a book a month. But the average book is around 64k words, while this starter fic is 3-4 times that.

If there's a discussion next friday is it on the whole thing with a free-for-all on spoilers? Or will it be the first 1/4th or something?

Just trying to figure out how the pacing will go.

*** This is my first time organizing a book club, so its very much in beta, plus I didn't realize it was so long (I usually drill through fics so my perception of length is probably a bit off, im already 1/4 through and started about 2 hours or so ago).

I think it should be assumed that its a free-for-all spoilers on the table for the discussion thread. Next time, depending on how this time goes, a threshold limit might need establishing. The discussion thread wont officially end till the Sunday, but then its ongoing on the sub. But thanks you've really brought up a valid point, have you done something like this before?

**** I reckon [[/r/hpmor/]] was doing readings from time to time and they were usually assigning a week to each several chapters or so. Provided that the whole sub is dedicated to a single fanfic work.

Can you please rephrase this? If someone has time to only read the first several chapters and gets his interest spoiled in the book-reading thread, I think it will negate the whole purpose of an initiative like this.

I'd personally suggest putting some limit to spoilers for the first week's discussions --- for instance put the 1st week's topic range up to the 0--5 chapters (or something like that). It's only a suggestion though. Maybe others would have some better ideas?

**** I haven't. My only experience is from seeing the GF's book club.

Sometimes it would be novels about women having sex with vampires, which everyone would read and want to talk about. Then other times it was Anna Kerenina and nobody except the host would read through and people would be spotty about attendance.

**** I know I'm a little late to the party, but this sounds like an awesome idea! However, I definitely agree that we need to set limits on amount read. I could read fanfic all day every day but I just don't have time. But I see you've done that :)

Relatedly, it would be awesome if we could consider releasing the next week's fic on Friday (at the beginning of the weekend), or doing this bi-weekly or something. I'd love to participate, but I work 50-60 hour weeks M-F and reading something announced on Sunday by the following Friday - especially a novel-length fic - just isn't going to happen. I imagine some of the other working people on the sub feel the same way.

Also agree with setting up a poll for the next fic-of-the-week - take recs in one thread and then let people upvote or just create a surveymonkey or something and let people vote there.

**** Thanks.

I thought such techniques are pretty much abandoned by now. Interestingly enough, you can't copy the text even if all javascripts are disabled. And there doesn't seem to be any invisible blocking elements either.

Anyway, to copy it you can do the following:

1. (for Firefox) install [[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/][Greasemonkey]];
2. install and use [[http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/33325][Fanfiction.net story export script]] to load all chapters on the same page;
3. save the changed page with full content as html or mht (using [[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/unmht/][UnMHT]]);
4. open the html / mht with your text editor (e.g. MS Word) and convert it to the proper format (e.g. docx). Or just copy everything from the opened html / mht and paste into a regular new document.

**** Nice! It works, thanks.

So ff.net overrides the text merely through CSS? Can you tell what do they use for the top “layer”?

p.s. You can also add [[http://www.mrtech.com/extensions/#toolkit][/MR Tech's Toolkit/]] to your instruction to help others find usercontent.css more easily. It adds several options in F→Tools→Edit My Config, among which are access points to userContent and userChrome.

***** To be honest, I do some programming but I'm not really a CSS guy. But yeah, ff.net overrode the ability to select things by wrapping them in a custom container that told your browser (through CSS) it was unclickable.

IIRC, if you look through the source, the thing FF.net uses to do the job is their custom built nocopy class.
