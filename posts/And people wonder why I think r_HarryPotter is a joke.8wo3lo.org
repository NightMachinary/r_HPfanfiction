** Harry never thought "Fuck Yea I'm Harry Potter." This is central to his character; he never wanted the recognition, fame, and status. He doesn't want to be the Boy Who Lived, rather just another wizard. Low effort post that doesn't fit the character.

*** That's why I called, [[/r/HarryPotter][r/HarryPotter]], the subreddit I took this image from, a joke.

** I believe this is called a joke. The joke being that there was any character development for Harry.

*** But Harry never wanted to be "Harry Potter", so this is basically neglecting one of his core character traits. It should be more like:

#+begin_quote
  Harry: Fuck, I am Harry Potter
#+end_quote

*** There was, however minor, character development for Harry.
