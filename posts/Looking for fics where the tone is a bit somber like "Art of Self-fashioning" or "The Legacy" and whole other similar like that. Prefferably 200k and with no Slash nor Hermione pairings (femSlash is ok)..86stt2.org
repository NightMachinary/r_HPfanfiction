#+TITLE: Looking for fics where the tone is a bit somber like "Art of Self-fashioning" or "The Legacy" and whole other similar like that. Prefferably 200k+ and with no Slash nor Hermione pairings (femSlash is ok).

*** Horcrux within seems quite interesting... What's the pairing in HP and the Accidental Horcrux or is it a Gen fic?

The summary for "Lesser Evils" didn't interest me much, is it good ?

Thanks anyways for the suggestions.

No pairings for Harry as of yet. As far as I know, no slash for Harry or H/Hr either.

It's one of the best dark!Harry stories I've read. Harry becoming more competent and darker actually makes sense, and there is no absurd bashing. Characterizations of other main characters are good as well.
