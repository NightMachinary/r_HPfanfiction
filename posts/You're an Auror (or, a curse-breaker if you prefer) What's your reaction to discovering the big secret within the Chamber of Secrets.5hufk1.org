So, imagine it:

You're an Auror, curse-breaker, ultra-wizard, or otherwise anti-dark-stuff-expert of your choice.

You've just been called to Hogwarts; apparently Harry Potter /somehow/ killed a basilisk, the same one that was causing havoc all year (apparently everyone saw only its reflected gaze, who'd have thought?).

The reason you're here, though, is because it was a /big/ basilisk; Harry understandably wants to know how it could have lived for a thousand years, where it got food and fresh water and everything else it needed, et-cetera. Albus Dumbledore is curious too.

--------------

So, that's the background. You're accompanying those two (Harry and Dumbledore) back to the Chamber of Secrets to find out why the basilisk lived so long and how it got so big in the process.

You've been through the bathroom, down the tunnel, cleared up the cave-in, seen the body (holy /crumpets/, it's huge!), and now, you've carefully taken apart the statue of Salazar that the basilisk emerged from, to see what lies behind.

--------------

It's a hatchery. A hatchery for basilisks.

There's thick glass tanks everywhere, several of them storing /more/ basilisks that are, thankfully, sleeping.

There's magical heat lamps providing light and heat, rows of crops and herds of rodents, and in the back, some sort of ancient alchemical machine chugging away.

There's desks, too. Full of books and written notes, some about alchemical conversion processes, others are plans on how to use basilisks in warfare, some on how to counter their traditional weaknesses...

...And yes, there's toads and chickens in that corner, roosters too, under a silencing charm. New basilisks are being hatched and moved to empty tanks as you watch.

--------------

So, you're standing with Dumbledore and a 12-year-old Harry in what is essentially an automated basilisk-producing factory.

If you had to voice your thoughts to Harry & Dumbledore at that moment, what would they be?

** Send in the blind to harvest the eyes.

Staves of Petrifaction are useful non lethal alternatives to the killing curse. We encase each eye in a transluscent substance that can be made selectively solid to the right people, then point it at people we dislike.

If we really hate them we make it absolutely clear and the Basilisk's true power of killing is used.

This will be valuable to the war effort.

What, against Voldemort? Don't make me laugh, he's just one ritual abusing terrorist. I speak of the Irish! These basilisks have a certain appeal to them, to bring the Irish back under the Wizarding Government of Great Britain and expel the Leprechaun-Sidhe ruling class who dare to order humans around

** How many bloody basilisks are there? One thousand years of automated basilisks? Or is this from Voldemort, so only 50 years of AUTOMATED BASILISKS.

Either way, honestly I think Fiendfyre is the only option (I totally get why some authors overuse The Fiend, it is actually the answer to so many of the HPverse's problems) unless Dumbledore comes up with an insane 17 year plan in which case they save one and christen him as The Basilisk-Who-Lived wherein he's taken from his family, the lovely Mrs Hen and Mr Toad who sacrificed their lives for him to live, and placed with The Diadophis family who hold a grudge against all magical snakes. Eventually he's sent off to Voldemort's School for Hisscraft and Slithery where for christmas he's given a cloak made from the skin of the original Basilisk ... and so on and so on.

** Right. Evacuate the school, right now! Potter, this includes you. Headmaster, start the emergency lock down procedures.

The reason the victims were only petrified, not killed, was because the last time someone was killed, the school was about to be shut down. Tom didn't want that happening again, before he was strong enough to become corporal and face Harry. I would have thought it'd be too risky to go around petrifying cats, let alone students, given that the school /should/ have been shut down once it became apparently history was repeating. Students got petrified last time, and then one killed, it should have been patently obvious there was a real danger of someone getting killed again.

"Language, Auror Shacklebolt." Dumbledore kindly chided.

"Um, professor, what does the word fuck mean?" Harry nervously asked.

"Well, Harry, here's what one of the definitions of fuck means." Dumbledore twinkled.

One," turning swiftly I point my wand at Harry, and whisper Obliviate and conjure a blindfold around his eyes so he doesnt see where we are before stunning him." Next we transport him all the way back to the hospital wing, and this never happened. Number two is decide if these basilisks can be kept or if they must be destroyed. This will decide three which is one of two options. We put the whole thing under the Fidelius, with one of us the secret keeper and move forward or we unleash Fiendfyre right now, and then obliviate each other and forget it ever happened."
