I'll start:

- "orbs" as eyes - like nails on chalkboard when I'm reading
- Hermione as "bushy-haired"
- Draco "drawls" or "drawled"

I know JKR uses these words herself, but I'm so sick of reading them. Many of you are fantastic writers, so I'm looking forward to reading your alternatives.

The house system in canon is arbitrarily divisive, in fanfiction it's so overdone that you'd think there were only four possible personality types in the wizarding world, and that calling someone out as being something other than the colour of their tie is the gravest insult imaginable.

**** I think it's interesting that fanon has basically codified the idea that Hogwarts houses as a source of identity follow wizards/witches (w/w) for the rest of their adult lives. You would think that by the time w/w are in their 30s, they wouldn't maintain this mental model that say, Susan Bones is hard-working because a hat put her in Hufflepuff over 20 years ago! I guess as a plot device the house-based identities provide a framework for maintaining canon personalities post-Hogwarts. But it's like, get over it.

***** Well yes of course they would change even in their seven years, also isn't it canon that those houses are for those personality traits? So I wouldn't say it was fanon that made them that way. I'm just saying when someone thinks of Slytherin they will most likely thing of cunning/ambition because they spend seven years (or less when they are still in school) being told Slytherin is Cunning/Ambitious. I'm not saying that they will only be what their house is. I'm saying that when someone things/talks about a house they will think what that house embodies.

****** Not really. Basic Psychology says that humans don't change easily when it comes to their baser personality. If you're a creative person, that is always coming up with ingenious things, chances are that ten years down the road, you will still be doing that. If you're the type of person that will drag the rug out from under people's feet to get what you want, chances are that you will still be that person ten years down the road (Example: Most Millionaires). And so on and so forth. I find that we almost never change, we just become ourselves even more, and that is where the hat puts you. A place where you will fit, even ten years down the road. This is why the Hat wanted to place Harry in Slytherin, he never fit in Gryffindor, no matter how much he tried, he just happened to have two friends that didn't fit as much as he did.

****** I see what you're saying. It's like the Houses are metaphors that everyone who went to Hogwarts "gets." That makes sense. I was thinking more of scenarios where an early 30s W/W character reconnects with, say, Theodore Nott and thinks, "Ah ha, although I didn't know Theodore at all at Hogwarts, since he was in Slytherin he must cunning and ambitious." I see a lot of stories where the characters see each other through the lenses of their House identities way past the age where that seems reasonable. As a plot device it is a short-hand way of developing characters, since the reader will know what it means to be a Slytherin. It is this short-hand that I think fanon has adopted widely in fics.

******* I see houses as a big part of a wizard's identity. They spend 7 years in them, make most of their friends there, and probably use their contacts to network later in life. That and the clichees the house qualities are means I don't see anything wrong with many people using the houses to classify others - even though it's wrong.

My Sirius, for example, will often think "typically Slytherin" when someone is cowardly, cunning, treacherous, or whatever else he takes issues with, while my Dumbledore doesn't think in those categories, knowing better.

******** Very interesting. In the original post I was just trying to open a discussion about banal vocabulary in HP fanfic, and to be honest, the use of the Houses isn't something I mind stylistically. I have a great respect for those of you who write, and I appreciate the effort you put into worldbuilding.

I became interested in this debate about the House identities because of the broader resonances it has across the JKR's magic world. Since basically 99% of W/W in UK go to Hogwarts, every magical person has some connection to a House and knows how that House differs from the other three. The annual House cup competition reinforces the positive and negative aspects of having a non-biological magical "family." In fandom I've never run across any racist wizards per se; instead we see divisions along the lines of pure-blood, half-blood, muggle-born and squib. So we have these two identity frameworks - blood status and House status - that inform the way British W/W relate to the world around them. In fiction, as in life, it is human nature to seek ways to differentiate Self-Other.

********* The houses are somewhat like college fraternities, I think. Membership is often "inherited" from their parents, with the alumni taking an interest in the house - like when Malfoy bought the new brooms for the Slytherin Quidditch Team.

And yes, people tend to form groups very easily - many experiments show that. What's the saying: Me against my brother, us two together against our cousin, all three of us against the world?

********** It makes a lot of sense, especially if you treat it as a cultural thing. Remember that the houses were founded by some of the most famous wizards around. Calling someone a Ravenclaw is like us calling someone an Einstein. Calling someone a Gryffindor is like calling someone a Beowulf. A Hufflepuff would be a MLK, and a Slytherin would be an Augustus. But then the trick is that everyone else adopts them as sort of patrons, so Slytherin for example gets painted with the same brush as Nixon, Rockefeller, and Dick Cheney.

*** Hmmm I rather disagree about the last two.

Having read at this point hundreds of novel length fanfictions I'm definitely over the Serious/Sirius joke but when an author is writing their fanfiction I think it would be wrong to take out a joke that has such a strong link to both canon and also Sirius as a character simply so jaded fanfiction readers don't have to read it again.

Is an author really meant to target their work to the few that have read the amount that we have? Shouldn't the author be writing their story as if someone hasn't read something like it before? I think you would agree that if you had never read a story with the Serious / Sirius joke in it, then you would appreciate it.

It's definitely a problem unique to fanfiction as opposed the literacy world as a whole, you have hundreds of authors and stories all of which are based off of the same characters so of course parts of those characters are going to come across as overdone. But should you really gut a part of a character simply because readers might have read it before? I think not.

As for roman numerals as chapters I fail to see how that could frustrate you in the slightest. Is there really any difference to you seeing Chapter VI and Chapter 6? If anything I prefer the VI.

Characters rolling their eyes, especially more than once. Seriously, I want them to roll out of your head at this point.

Calling eyes 'Orbs' or any other variance of such. Or going on and on about their color/describing them in a multitude of ways, multiple times. Once or twice is enough, if the story line calls for it.

People Smirking more than once in a short period of time. Or at all. Seriously, no.

People chuckling in general.

Hermione being constantly described as inquisitive/curious/etc. We get it, she's bookish and smart.

People having long, unnecessary conversations with the Sorting Hat.
