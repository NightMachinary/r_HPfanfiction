I know quite a few of you, like me, have been bummed at the disappearance of Flagfic.com. Just saw this: "FLAG has been moved to entirely new infrastructure in a different location after experiencing major issues with the datacentre where FLAG has been hosted for the last few years, and will be back soon. Unfortunately the nature of the change requires some modification of the backend code to cope with the differences - this is being worked on at the moment, and I hope to have FLAG back up and running normally in the near future.

Please watch this page for updates. Any significant news, including an announcement when FLAG is back up and working normally, will also be posted to @flagfic on Twitter.

Thanks for your ongoing patience while I have been dealing with this issue.

Regards, Erayd"


** Happy to hear it will be back in some form. It was without question the best ebook generator for fanfics I have ever used.
