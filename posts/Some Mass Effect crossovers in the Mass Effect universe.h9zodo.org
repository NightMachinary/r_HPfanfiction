Hello, do you know any crossover with Mass Effect but set in the universe of Mass Effect? In which, for example, Harry is a biotic, Hermione an asari, and magic doesn't exist?


** I've seen a few /Harry Potter///Mass Effect/ fanfics where Harry can use biotics as well as magic, but I've never seen one that operated as an AU in such a fashion.

I feel like removing magic from the equation gets rid of the point of the crossover.

** Well there's linkffn(Harry Potter: Geth by mjimeyg)

Harry gets sent into the future by a spell and he lands in the vicinity of Geth that pretty much turns him into paste. So the Geth 6 million dollar geth him out and use him as their emissary.

It has Hermione in a sort of fashion but not others.
