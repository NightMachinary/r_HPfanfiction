This was a relatively old fanfiction where Harry practices Blood and Necromantic Magic and I believe can interact with artefacts like the Cloak of Invisibility, The Philosopher's Stone and the Sorting Hat. The story has been deleted by the author but I've been trying desperately to find a copy of said story from any archiving site and to my chagrin, haven't found a shred. I know it wasn't a very good story and it was incomplete but I do want to read it again and would be very happy if someone could forward any appropriate archive link to said story or a downloadable copy if possible. Thanks again
