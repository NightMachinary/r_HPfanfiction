Harry in year five always had an interesting reaction whenever he would lock eyes with Dumbledore and I wonder how things would of changed if Dumbledore was the one to teach Harry.

  Some men were born average and went on to live an average life. He was not, had never been, and would never be one of those men. With his ancestry, it was hardly a surprise. Facing off against enemies old and new, very few things could come more naturally to him. No Slash. AU. Dimension Travel with a dash of Time Travel. Darker themes: war, politics, questionable morality, and etc.
