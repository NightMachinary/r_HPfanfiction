According to the wiki, Fiendfyre cannot be extinguished with normal or enchanted water. Can it survive a vacuum?


** In Order of the Phoenix, we learn of Gubraithian fire, a magical fire which never goes out. Hermione comments on how exceptional this piece of magic is; Dumbledore himself performed it, and it was unique enough to be considered a gift so valuable that it might sway the giants not to join Voldemort.

Given how unique and special Gubraithian fire is considered to be, I doubt Fiendfyre replicates its properties. So I don't think Fiendfyre is an eternal inextinguishable flame like Gubraithian fire is. Fiendfyre is /cursed/ fire, not /perpetual/ fire. It /can/ be put out (albeit with some difficulty), and will in any event run its course.

*** True. But which part is cursed?

Evidently, it's cursed such that water doesn't work. By the same token, I'd be surprised if (simple) vacuum or (simple) cold worked. IMO, a very reasonable interpretation is that Fiendfyre can only be extinguished by magical means, not physical ones.

If there existed an equivalently cursed ice, that might do it. A bit clich√©, but thematically it fits HP, where the opposite of a spell is often used to correct the first spell.

**** I think the description as cursed fire is actually quite revealing.

Two features of dark magic we are familiar with from the books are (i) dark magic resists other magic, e.g. by being more difficult to heal; and (ii) dark magic is in some sense malicious in nature.

And all the unique characteristics of fiendfyre kinda fall into those categories. Resists Aguamenti and destroys objects beyond repair fit into (i). Chases people and its own caster down fits into (ii).

What this suggests to me is that the fire isn't going to do anything special when it encounters a lack of fuel. There's nothing there to resist, because it's not so much an action being taken against it. Rather, the fire has encountered an /absence/ of something. The cursed aspect isn't engaged by that; it's just the underlying fire's nature not to burn if there's no fuel.

Trivially I think this must be true, else the fiendfyre unleashed in the Room of Requirement would have burnt all Hogwarts down and kept going until it encountered a wizard strong enough to control it. But that didn't happen, so it must at some point just stop spreading even without a wizard there to stop it.

***** The thing wrong with your Room of Requirement example is that once the Fiendfyre burns everything including air, it could've possibly survived in there, contained by the Room of Requirement and just stored away as one of the many "rooms"/parts of it, as we never see it get extinguished, we only see Harry and co. leave the Room and it closing as nobody's there, and since the room of requirement can change according to a house elf's wishes, whos to say that Hogwarts with it's limited, but still there, sentience won't have its wishes granted, as Hogwarts' sentience comes from its protection and the amount of magic from ley lines and the magic performed within, its priority will be the security of its inhabitants, and the Room being part of Hogwarts may grant that wish before the Fiendfyres' wish to consume everything (Fiendfyre has limited sentience, that is only focused on consuming things).

***** It doesn't resist /just/ magic though. It resists attempts to douse it with water. I'm not even going to argue physics, but even so, it clearly resists /one/ way to snuff out an ordinary fire. Given its nature of a destructive dark arts spell, I'd say it's a fair (if obviously impossible-to-prove) extrapolation that it resists /all/ common methods.

(Also, if the fire can create fire-animals that chase people, it might not be all the concerned with fuel?)

As for the RoR, I honestly always figured it was the magic in the room that did it. If it had been any other room than the RoR, the castle /would/ have burned down.

**** My headcanon for fiendfire is that it eats magic. That's all. The difficulty with controlling it is entirely because you are feeding it your own magic to keep it going. It's like trying to put out a normal fire using paper. Theoretically possible, but you have to know what you are doing. It could survive in a vacuum, provided there was magic to feed off. As to how it got put out in the RoR? Hogwarts. The room is a conjured thing, therefore Hogwarts can control magic at least within that room. Without anybody (alive) in the room, Hogwarts (automatically or not) reclaimed the magic that went into making the room, snuffing the fire out as sure as sucking the air out of a room with a fire in.

*** Well, Gubraithain Fire doesn't kill the caster like Fiendfyre does. It was mentioned that Fiendfyre isn't really hard to cast, but extremely hard to control so that it doesn't just burn everything it touches.

So, Gubraithain Fire is probably worth something because it's safe & a cheap method of having some source of fire, and as you say, eternal. Still, it most likely has to nourish itself with ambient magic to stay alive.

Fiendfyre is probably eternal as well as long it has material to devour. It's a magical fire and one of the most dangerous, and even pseudo-sentient. I doubt that it is just a stronger form of normal fire. It's probably on par with dragonfire, and enchanted with some stuff that makes it manifest as beasts of prey, which will pounce and attack stuff when summoned.

My guess is that if someone were to cast Fiendfyre on the Forbidden Forest, it would devour the entire Forest and burn as long it can find new sources to fuel itself. The only way to stop it might be to cut off its supply of burnable material, or magical water, or spells like glacius, or maybe some spell we don't know about, etc.

**** I think it's a bit more simple. I believe that Fiendfire will burn in literally all environments, vacuum included, so long as magic is supplied to it. This means the important part is that Fiendfire tries to kill its caster. Once the caster is dead/stops supplying magic, the flames will become effectively nothing but water resistant flames.

*** The difficulty doesn't come from making it survive without air, it comes from making it so it stays hot, and burns forever (if there is no interference) /without/ fuel, with sufficient fuel/maintenance any fire can survive forever.

**** I'm not sure what on what basis you are determining these propositions.

Canonically, the only things we know about fiendfyre are (i) it is sufficient to destroy objects beyond magical repair, (ii) it spreads quickly, (iii) Aguamenti does not put it out, (iv) it forms into the shapes of animals which chase people down, and (v) it turns on the caster if not controlled.

Aside from those special features - which would all appear to derive from the fact that the flame is cursed - fiendfyre appears to behave like ordinary fire. For example, Harry comments on the charred remains of the objects in the RoR, indicating it consumes its fuel like ordinary fire. Which also implies that it would not be able to exist without fuel. And air, as the oxidant, is one of the two fuels of a fire (the other being the reductant).

In contrast, canonically, the only thing we know about Gubraithian fire is that (i) it never consumes the object to which it is attached and (ii) it is ever-lasting. So gubraithian fire occurs without chemical combustion occuring at all - it is an entirely magical fire which does not obey the normal chemistry of fire at all.

*** In pyrodynamics we know that a fire need 3(commonly) or 4 things, namely fuel, heat, oxygen, and a chemical reaction to create fire. In magical fire I think the fuel is most likely magic, so any fire spell most likely need some sort of magic to fuel it, Gubraithian fire also most likely turn the ambient Magic to fuel it. I think the fire is unique because of its eternal life, but I don't think it was tested in a real vacuum to know wheather it can survive it, and also weather magic can stay in the vacuum. As technically we can not have physical access to the true vacuum, what we use the term vacuum means little to no air, magic, I don't think is affected by air, so Gubraithian fire most likely can survive no air, same way I think fiendfyre can also survive vacuum if there is enough magic to fuel it.

Also I think Dumbledore don't count fiendfyre as any 'gift' it's a curse, and a very dangerous one, not only to the victim but for the caster too, by that standard Gubraithian fire is only ' light' fire that is eternal.

** I would say, no. The Fiendfyre in the Room of Requirement expanded rapidly with apparent hunger. I would say that the danger of Fiendfyre is that it rapidly expands, burns everything, and can't be extinguished by normal means. But just like the mindless aggression that sparks it, it always must move on to new targets. Without somewhere to expand, it burns through its fuel and disappears.

So in a vacuum, with nothing to burn, the fiendfyre would disappear.

Edit: And the Killing Curse rips the soul from the body, but we still see Dumbledore in the Limbo that Harry is sent to after getting AK'ed, but the Killing Curse can also destroy Horcruxes meaning it can also destroy souls, therefore just because a soul is damaged, it doesn't mean that it can't progress to the afterlife, otherwise we would be seeing a lot more Diarymort-Esque spirits created by partial souls that couldn't move on

** From what I know, yes. First look at Gubraithian Fire "the Everlasting Flame" which can survive without fuel, air, and heat, and is a step down (in my opinion) from Fiendfyre, Gubraithian Fire proves that it is possible to create fire that can survive in those conditions. Secondly, look at the size and the heat (you can tell it's hot by its abilities), if it is that hot and big, and also increases in size, temperature, speed, etc. as time goes on, all the air nearby would be consumed faster than it can be replenished in the fire's area, meaning if Fiendfyre can't survive without air then it wouldn't be that useful, and it wouldn't be able to do what it did in the Room of Requirement. Finally, I believe that Fiendfyre consumes and is attracted to magic, it would choose a small but magical target over a large but nonmagical target because the magical target provides more fuel, so as long as there is magic fueling it, it will survive. Testing the vacuum thing will be impossible though, there isn't any nonmagical material that can survive it, and if you try to enchant the vacuum chamber to survive Fiendfyre, it will just sap the magic, and therefore breaking the spell. I'm betting someone will counter the "magic fuel" theory by saying that "If it can absorb magic and break protections like that, then why isn't it used more often, by cursebreakers and the like", well if you pour a few hundred gallons of gasoline on a fire, it will be uncontrollable, right? Apply the same logic to Fiendfyre, if you let it absorb too much magic, it will become too powerful/uncontrollable, and no amount of magical force, will power, and charms can extinguish/control it, at that point you may just let it consume everything there, while you focus on making the surrounding area devoid of magic.

** My guess is... Yes - as long it has stuff to burn.

I mean, there is stuff, like magnesium for example, that makes it possible for fire to burn underwater - so, there is no air and it also in a 'hostile' environment, but the fire still burns as long it has material to feed upon.

Fiendfyre is a magical fire, and one of the strongest. It should be able to burn without the need for oxygen since it wasn't created in a natural way but through magical means. Only magical means should be able to extinguish it. Or, it will go out when there is nothing left to burn.

Let's not forget that it's pseudo-sentient. It doesn't mean much, but I guess that this property will make the fire another few levels stronger.

...

My personal theory is that it can stay alive even if there is nothing left to burn by devouring the magic in the environment.\\
So, when the Fiendfyre is eventually extinguished, you might feel that it's harder to cast magic in the area affected by its destructive hunger because it exhausted all the magic around you.\\
And of course, the area is plagued by some 'Dark Energy' that makes it hard for plant-live and so on to grow. It has to be cleaned by druidic magic or whatever (think of it as some kind of radioactive poisoning).

Now, that's assuming that we believe that magic is still answerable in some way to the laws of physics. If we believe magic is able to ignore all that, then it doesn't really matter.

** My headcannon is yes, past a certain threshold. To arrive at this statement, we must first exxamine the knowledge we possess of it.

1. Fiendfyre is one of the easiest fire spells to actually cast, but extremely hard to control.

2. It physically and magically damages objects and environments it consumes. We see this in Horcruxi, which have self-repair abilities. We arrive at that conclusion from the statement "must be damaged beyond magical repair."

3. It can consume itself, as shown in Fantastic Beasts when Nicholas Flamel used it to contain Grindelwald's casting of it.

4. It is capable of being enchanted beyond it's base magical properties, but the wielder must prevent it from breaking those charms. This is also shown in Fantastic Beasts, when the circle allows those loyal to Grindelwald through it without harm, but kills those who aren't. After he left, those charms broke and the circle went out of control.

5. It is extremely aggressive, willing to consume the world if it can.

We know that most forms of energy in modern physics are actually created by the movement of sub-atomic particles and waveforms. My assumption is yes, magic is included in that, but the nature of the energy "repairs" loose electrons that form electricity to other atoms or transports it elsewhere, which is why electronics are damaged by magic.

Now, we know that magic is capable of imitating matter or turning into it permanently (temp and permanent Transfiguration and conjuration), and is also capable of destroying it, or turning it into magical energy (vanishing).

So if fiendfyre gained enough ppwer from normal burning inside the atmosphere, it's magical properties would begin converting energy and subatomic particles into magic to sustain it's existence. When it reaches that threshold, it would theoretically be capable of destroying a planet or solar system, possibly more, while leaving only the void or magically inert ash behind.

If we assume that there is such a thing as "ambient magic" that is not a field generated by other magical entities, but is similar to background cosmic microwaves, it could theoretically, at a certain level, begin to feed on that and consume the universe. If we assume that parallel universes actually touch ours at the border, in a theoretical circumstance a single extremely powerful casting of fiendfyre might be capable of destroying the multiverse.

So in short, yes, it is indeed capable of surviving in the vacuum.
