I remember reading a fic a while back and have been wracking my brain trying to remember its name. I was hoping you guys could help me find it again.

Basically, the fic had Vernon discovering Harry's trust vault, and he went and emptied it in its entirely, using the money to buy a new house and car, and moving his family to the new house, all while Harry is still at Hogwarts. Harry ends up waiting at King's Cross station for his uncle to pick him up for a while, and I even recall Hermione staying with him for a while on the bench outside of King's Cross, at least until they have a really nasty argument.

I don't remember all the details, but I do recall that it was a Harry/Hermione fic, and that Voldemort unleashes a literal army of Inferi across all of England. I also remember that Vernon gets caught up in the invasion as well, and crashed his new car.


** How would that even happen? How would Vernon get into Diagon Alley and past the goblins? I am intrigued ...

*** From what I recall of the story, I think what happens is that the goblins accidentally send a statement of Harry's trust vault to Harry's home address, but since Harry isn't at the Dursley's, Vernon ends up getting it. He then sends a letter back to the goblins asking them to convert everything in Harry's trust vault to muggle money and to deposit it in a muggle bank account.

*** We have no indication that the goblins have an identity check before accessing accounts. Hagrid removes the Philosopher's Stone from Gringotts with nothing more than an easily forged piece of paper. Molly and Bill are able to access Harry's bank account with just Harry's key. If Vernon has got Harry's key - which he could easily have got from Harry's trunk, it's not like Harry keeps it on him 24/7 - then there's no reason for the goblins not to let Vernon into Harry's account.

As for how he would get in, just wait for someone else to go through and follow them.

I don't doubt he'd be really uncomfortable the whole time and probably would hate it, but frankly a lot of us are willing to do things we don't like for pecuniary gain.
