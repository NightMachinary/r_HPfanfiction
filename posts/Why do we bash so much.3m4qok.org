** I don't see bashing of a particular fic, like actual bashing, very often, and its usually limited to the same few stories or tropes.

There's nothing wrong with expressing a negative opinion, as long as you're not a dick. Saying the grammar was bad isn't bashing. Saying there were a lot of plot holes isn't bashing. Saying the characters were completely OOC is not bashing.

I personally love seeing someone point something out in a story that is bad- it serves as a warning! If the grammar in a story that I thought about reading is awful, and I'm warned ahead of time, I can make a more informed decision whether to read it or not. If the plot was promising but the characters were all Mary sues, I'd seriously much rather know ahead of time. If the plot seems like a Scenes From a Hat skit, let's not.

Even one or two lines out of proper context can be that warning. Just, you know, don't be awful about it.

Edit: I wanted to add, the thing about grammar and spelling, if English is your first language and you went or are going to school in an English teaching school, I don't really see the reason for awful spelling and grammar, other than health reasons. I don't think health reasons cover the vast number of authors who have their profile set to somewhere in the US and age 16+. I honestly just don't understand it.

*** This. The reason I recently pointed out that a recommended fic was /really, truly awful/ is because I come here for good recommendations. I can't speak to DLP as I have only been on that site a few times as it doesn't render in a work-friendly way and I do most of my reading at work - and honestly it doesn't render very well on my phone, either, and that's where I do the rest of my reading. When I get a recommendation here with a few upvotes I assume that it's going to be a great story. I am truly disappointed when I get a couple chapters in and realize it's a rehashed grammatical abomination of plot holes and bad characterization. It's not "bashing" so much as warning other people - hey, unless you LIKE this sort of thing, avoid this story! I already wasted time realizing it was a big fat stinking mess.

**** That's part of why if there's a story I want to recommend but it has problems, and I /remember/ those problems, I point them out when I recommend it, unless the thread is for a theme. OOC, strange plot, abandoned, overused trope, whatever. You guys deserve to know.

Sometimes fun stories are bad. The one I'm reading has bad spelling and really off characterization, but I'm continuing because it's honestly amusing. But I'd have loved to know that "definitely" is spelled "defiantly" /and/ that the author loves that word before going in.

** I think people shouldn't take fanfiction so seriously. Ripping in to fics because you don't like them is pretty unfair - no one is forcing you to read.

Things like Harry Crow and Methods of Rationality generate discussion because they have a huge following. But when people bring them up in every single "What's the worst story?!" thread it gets old. It's like bringing a dead horse back to life, killing it again, just so you can beat it.

On the other hand, critiquing is a lot of fun and some fics are objectively bad. I really like the "What are you're fanfiction pet peeves?" threads. They're fun, they generate good discussion, and I imagine that they're helpful to authors. I also like the opposite "What do you really like to see in a fanfiction?" threads for the same reason.

** As someone who has written ~250,000 words of fanfiction, I value one review tearing my story apart over 100 reviews offering empty praise.

I write because I want to tell a good story. It is not possible to write a good story without first writing bad ones and learning from them.

[[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=1961][Here]] is a fanfic I wrote in 2006. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9778984/1/The-One-He-Feared][Here]] is a fanfic I wrote in 2014. The difference is night and day. While I'll be the first to admit I still have plenty more to learn, it's undeniable that my writing has improved dramatically, not just in terms of technical skill but also with regards to how to build a plot, how to develop characters and give them unique voices, how to pace and structure, etc.

This progress only exists because people were willing to tell me in a blunt and honest way what I was doing wrong. If a person's story is terrible, I consider it a favour to tell them why, just as I consider it a favour when people tell me what is wrong with my fics. The key is that you explain /why/.

Further, it's not just about individual writers. As fans of HP fanfiction we all want to increase the amount of good fanfic in the community. We'll only achieve that by being honest with each other.

Fan fiction is a hobby and reviews from readers is motivation. You can't really treat reviews from readers to be some sort of book editor critiquing your work in the outmost high standards.

**** This is close to what I'm trying to say. I'd hazard a guess that most authors of fan-fiction wrote a story because they love a fandom and want to share their version of the fandom with people. Very few I'd wager are actually trying to turn it into something more than that.

For example a few weeks back I made a post inquiring about my favorite fic that I'd thought was abandoned. Turns out it was, but in the comments, some guy told me the fic was 'the worst piece of generic cliche fiction". Well I reread the first few chapters, and while yes it does have some generic themes, right in the author's notes was something along the lines of "This is what I like to imagine happened". The guy wasn't trying to be a professional author or anything like that. He just wanted to share his excitement with other fans and to this day people still say /Taking Control/ is cliche ridden and terrible.

I'm not trying to say the guy in the comments was wrong or not entitled to his opinion, but that many of the people who talk about fan-fiction like this should understand very few authors want to be the next Stephen King.

It's hard for me to express this view as I do want people to be a critic of my stories and help me get better, but I also want people to remember why most of us are here: We are all fans of fan-fiction and Harry Potter in general. Enjoy it and be as excited for each new, or old, take on the fandom as you can.

Reviews aren't meant as some sort of feedback to the author. Reviews are meant towards other people. I want to know what other fans think of specific fics and whether I should give a shit about reading it. I don't care about reviews that give empty praise, I want to read some people who didn't like it and know what could be wrong with it before I start reading it. Likewise a good review can work as a recommendation for a fic I might ant to check out.

If the author is influenced by reviews to try and do better then that is entirely up to him and not my main concern.

I'd think that everyone who writes wants to get their story across - otherwise there would be no point to it. Writing is one of the most obvious forms of self-expression, and if writers have glaring issues then they are failing at what they set out to do. The writers you discuss want to write at people and not to them. Sure, there's a right to do that.

If they were just writing for themselves, they'd keep their stories on their computers. Posting publicly indicates a desire to communicate with others. Anyone doing that should /want/ to know if they are doing it poorly.

The only way to remove the contradiction, I think, is if the person arrogantly assumes that we should conform to however they are trying to communicate, rather than that they should conform to normal standards of effective communication.

*** Honest critique is great, but I don't think there's productive critique in these threads. What I do see are a lot of complaints about other people's tastes and calling things stupid, which is a downer for everyone, readers and writers.

Going through the two writing threads I've made, a lot of beginner writers in the subreddit right now feel too self-conscious to post their stories and are afraid of "contributing to the bad fic," which the negative posts aggravate. Tearing apart someone's writing who just started a month ago won't help them. They need to actually write first before they can improve. I'm sure honest critique helped you, but you've also been writing for years and wrote hundreds of thousands of words.

I have no issue with the threads popping up every once in a while (less than they are now) but I wouldn't equate those posts to critique. Edit, from below: How I see it, bashing is when the person wants to feel better by complaining, and critiquing is when the person actually wants to help. Bashing might help some people, but the intent is not to help.

Yes it will. Honest to god, if you want to get better at writing, if you want to understand how to tell a story in a way that resonates with people, if you want to write words that make people pay attention, words that stick in their memory, /yes it absolutely will./

There is nothing more helpful than being shown in excruciating detail the whys and hows of why your writing needs work.

It /really sucks./ "Hey, you know that very personal, very creative thing you spent so, so long working on? It's pretty bad. You should start over and work on X, Y, and Z."

"Don't use magical cores in your story, they are a bad idea" is not an objective criticism, but an attempt to bully an author into writing a story to your personal taste, for example.

"If you use magical cores, how do you solve the problem where a bunch of mooks can exhaust even Dumbledore, weakening him to the point where he can be easily defeated?" is a more constructive, and more objective criticism. But even then, if the author says "that's intended, I want that, to avoid the problem of Dumbledore simply casting all day. I want him to have to conserve his spells, be ready for Voldemort, so he cannot simply defeat all the Death Eaters that show up by himself", then that's it.

***** In my experience, it's just not helpful at that point. It's like telling first semester computer science students they should code with fancy frameworks and better languages when they can barely code at all. It doesn't matter how much you yell at someone for shitty characterization if they don't know how to improve it and they don't understand the suggestions for how to improve it.

There's great critique that would actually help them improve at that point, but like [[/u/bisonburgers]] said as well, there isn't a lot of great critique out there. Good critique recognizes the skill level of the author. It should be concrete and give them something to focus on. I think starting over is /terrible/ advice. How are beginners going to get better if they keep starting over? That's why I think /actually writing/ is the best way to improve writing for the first year, because most people don't even put in the effort, and it weeds out people who don't actually care. There certainly isn't great critique in bashing threads (they ones recently aren't as bad as they used to be, which is what I'm basing this off of). They're full of complaining.

****** There's a very real and interesting phenomenon going on there, I think. There are many subjects where it's impossible to realize how bad you are without first being aware of how to do it right - and thus many who suck at it honestly don't realize it. Instead, they think they are doing just fine.

You don't need to know a lot about engines to know if you are a good or bad mechanic. On the other hand, you do need to learn a good bit about logic and logical arguments before you can recognize whether your own arguments are strong or weak.

Grammar is more similar to logic than to engines - there are a lot of people who are lousy with grammar and logic but who have no idea because they don't know enough about the rules to recognize their own mistakes. They self-report as being quite good, contrary to all evidence.

I think story writing may be similar. What this means is that you won't get a poor writer to recognize how poor their writing really is until they learn a lot more about how to write properly. It's a Catch-22, though, because it's hard to motivate someone to learn the basics of a subject they think they already do well at.

Personally, I recommend comparing/contrasting examples of good and poor writing. Speaking for myself, I read thousands of fiction books over the years and never would have been able to tell you anything about what constituted "good" writing (aside from grammar and spelling, of course). Maybe I could have, I don't know, but I doubt it. After a couple of years of reading fanfics of varying qualities, I developed a much better of idea of what worked, what didn't, and why. I don't think I'd be writing as well as I am now without being exposed to lots of examples of what doesn't work.

Maybe such an approach would help others realize that there are things they don't know and need to learn.

I agree with this. 3 benefits come to mind right away:

 

1) It shows the critiqued writer concrete ways to improve

 

2) It is more convincing to the writer since the critic backs up their opinion. A critic shouldn't rely on the "bandwagon" fallacy (everyone says so) or an "appeal to authority" back up their criticism, such as expecting your critique to be respected since you are a moderator, recognized writer, etc.

 

3) Comparing/contrasting allows the critic more objectivity by allowing them to 'show' instead of 'tell'.

 

The trouble is, it takes effort to write a critique like that. It also takes a bit of humility, not to the writer you are critiquing, but because you have to acknowledge to yourself that your opinion/criticism by itself isn't good enough, it needs support.

 

The recent post [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3m1o7i/why_most_dialogue_in_fanfiction_is_terrible/][Why most dialogue in fanfiction is terrible]] by [[/u/Pashow]] is a good example of compare/contrast.

I look back on this review, to make sure I'm not contributing to the general blandness that most ffs are.

Scathing reviews help, at least for me.

Good critique is "In your Dramione story, I think you should outlay the process where Hermione accepts Draco as having truly changed in more detail, it seems to happen a bit too fast. Maybe add some flashback scene to where he helps her out during the war, or some scene where she observes him acting differently than she's used to."

I rarely bash specific fics, mostly because when I encounter a bad one I just close it and forget all about it. However, in the thread about fics that should be bashed, I did mention DAYD. I did this to counter all the recommendations it gets, because all those recommendations made me waste my time on that awful piece of literary sewage, hoping it would get better, but it only got worse and worse.

Aside from an admittedly spiteful satisfaction that comes from trashing things I despise, I genuinely think this bashing serves to prevent people from wasting their own time with that story. I don't know how come this fics gets so many recommendations, but someone has to balance things out.

** The reason that I, shall we say, /proactively criticize/ some fanfics is that no fanfic is born and exists in a vacuum. Rather, I view the fandom as a metaphorical ecosystem, with each fanfic being an organism that is a recombination of canon, values and ideas the author brings to the fandom, and fanfics already there.

This means that the fics that are already there --- and how they are viewed --- will affect fics yet to be written. Interpretations of canon and characters, extra-canonical setting and character elements (i.e., "fanon", good and bad), and other ideas, they propagate from fic to fic.

Therefore, the live-and-let-live "don't like, don't read" approach, while it works for things like romantic pairings, doesn't work for things not as easily categorized and filtered like "magical cores": yesterday's readers are tomorrow's writers, so things like bad fanon will spread from fic to fic; one can't easily filter them; and it creates the highly unpleasant situations where an otherwise very enjoyable fic is degraded by bad ideas adopted from other fics. In the worst cases, bad fanon notions serve as basis for entire fics. And, arguably, even worse are situations where a fic itself is not significantly degraded by a bad fanon element and doesn't even particularly need it, but rather takes it for granted and propagates it to future fics.

And, by the time a chapter that makes use of bad fanon and such (and therefore propagates it) has been posted, even when said fanon is not necessary for the story being told and adds nothing to it, it is almost always too late to persuade the author privately to go back and edit the chapter, so it has to be called out in public fora instead.

Hence the kvetching.

Because it's very bad writing. The fanon version of magical cores is a) a shortcut that undermines such trivial concepts as pace, dramatic tension, and character development, b) a cheap ("unearned") excuse to overpower your protagonist, c) a concept that adds nothing substantial to the plot or d) all of the above.

"Not canon" has nothing to do with it.

There's nothing distasteful about the idea in theory, but in practice the way magical cores have developed and codified into the specific Harry Potter fanfiction trope is just all kinds of bad, from a storytelling perspective. And that's not a matter of taste, that's just basic literary criticism.

Remember Midi-chlorians from the Star Wars prequels, and how hard we all rolled our eyes at that storytelling device? Same thing. Same reason it's just objectively bad.

The "don't like, don't read" paradigm applies to comments just as much as it applies to fic in the first place. For that matter, I am not sure why you're personalizing it that much. 90% of the time, it's about the fic, not the author.

Please don't put words in my mouth. "Magical cores" were an example with which almost all readers would be familiar, and with controversy over which most readers would be familiar.

Now, that's an empirical claim. I suspect --- though it's not high on my priority list of things to do --- that if you took a random sample of fics off, say, FF.net, classified them on whether they used "magical cores" and the amount and quality of character development (controlling for genre, length, etc.), you might well find a negative correlation.

I would be happy to amend that quote to "I think that it actually makes a story more likely (in a causal way) to have other properties (related less to specific fanon and more to aspects like the quality of characterization and plotting) that make it worse than it probably would have probably been otherwise", though I think that my posts are verbose enough as it is. (There's a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granger_causality][Granger causality]] joke somewhere in there, but I can't think of a good one at the moment.)

In the meantime, would you care to amend any of your strawmen and mischaracterizations of what I've written in this thread? Or, perhaps, amend your repeated portrayal of your opinions and preferences on how people should interact on a forum and conduct discussions as objective using the very same "good" and "bad" adjectives? (Quotations available upon request.) It's only fair and honest.

************* I don't see the need to amend anything, as long as you uphold this post of yours:

"The reason that I, shall we say, proactively criticize some fanfics is that no fanfic is born and exists in a vacuum. Rather, I view the fandom as a metaphorical ecosystem, with each fanfic being an organism that is a recombination of canon, values and ideas the author brings to the fandom, and fanfics already there. This means that the fics that are already there --- and how they are viewed --- will affect fics yet to be written. Interpretations of canon and characters, extra-canonical setting and character elements (i.e., "fanon", good and bad), and other ideas, they propagate from fic to fic. Therefore, the live-and-let-live "don't like, don't read" approach, while it works for things like romantic pairings, doesn't work for things not as easily categorized and filtered like "magical cores": yesterday's readers are tomorrow's writers, so things like bad fanon will spread from fic to fic; one can't easily filter them; and it creates the highly unpleasant situations where an otherwise very enjoyable fic is degraded by bad ideas adopted from other fics. In the worst cases, bad fanon notions serve as basis for entire fics. And, arguably, even worse are situations where a fic itself is not significantly degraded by a bad fanon element and doesn't even particularly need it, but rather takes it for granted and propagates it to future fics. And, by the time a chapter that makes use of bad fanon and such (and therefore propagates it) has been posted, even when said fanon is not necessary for the story being told and adds nothing to it, it is almost always too late to persuade the author privately to go back and edit the chapter, so it has to be called out in public fora instead. Hence the kvetching."

You directly state here that you goal is to prevent "bad fanon" from spreading, to prevent fics from "degrading by bad ideas". Basically, you want to eliminate ideas you think are bad.

Strawmen? You're the one on a crusade, you're the one who claims you need to call out people on a forum for using "bad ideas".

Well, yes. I think some ideas are bad, and I would prefer it if fewer people used them. What's so strange about that? I am sure some people can do great things with them, but vast, vast majority of people who use them use them unthinkingly, often because they think it's canon. (A good benign example is "Dan" and "Emma" for Hermione's parents' names. It started out as a Harmonian signifier, but many non-Harmonians now use it without being aware of its origins.)

You seem to have a crusade of your own --- and I've actually quoted you on some of your more radical proposals, without a wall of text for others to pick through. I don't think I've ever hidden the fact that I want external reality to correspond closer to my preferences and act to that end. I don't think there's anyone who doesn't.

*************** It's not strange to want reality to correspond to your preference - many want that. That doesn't make it a good thing though. And how you go about it is very important.

Your personal preference doesn't make something "bad", and neither does not following canon make something "bad".

Why can't you simply say "I don't like this, I'd prefer it if it wasn't in the story"? Why do you have to act as if something is objectively bad because you don't like it?

That I do not get. Is it so hard to admit that your personal preferences are just that, personal preferences?
