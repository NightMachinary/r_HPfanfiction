I am looking for stories where Harry is not friends with Ron and Hermione but that doesn't bash them. Every story I have read where Harry has other friends or is in another House seems to go out of its way to make them horrible people.


** Linkffn(Harry Potter And The Elemental's Power) - I read this long ago. Don't remember what's what but as far as I can remember there was no bashing.

******* How one might or might not get along with a fictional character if they were a real person has almost no bearing on how fun they are to read about.

For an extreme example, the fandom hates Dolores Umbridge, perhaps more so than Voldemort, but that's exactly what makes her a great and memorable character.

But a large number of Harry Potter fandom picks their pitchforks and flame anyone if people show their contempt for character like Hermoine. She is a memorable character, I agree. But she is not a lovable character.

I will have a lot of fun to read a pushy character shown it's place. Or a know it all getting a tongue lashing in by teachers. But saddling (and forcing) her with a protagonist.....? That's not fun.

And, frankly, given how the vast majority of "gray Harry" fics are,

1. He doesn't start hating Hermione; he starts hating a deeply fanon image of Hermione.
2. He does a lot of the very things Hermione haters hate Hermione for, but when he does it, it's leadership, independence, and diligence.
3. Personality-wise, he'd be much harder to get along with than even canon Hermione.

I actually like the idea of Hermione being aggressively competitive, but in this case, that Harry was cheating in class is a better explanation; and she was also correct in that Harry didn't actually have the expertise in Potions to tell if the instructions were accurate, were missing crucial steps, etc.. Rather, he gambled and got lucky. He could have ended up in St. Mungo's or worse.

Observe that she /never/ resented Harry for doing better in DADA, even as early as 3rd year and as late as 6th. Jealousy is not the best explanation here. And, "destructive"?

If only it were just "some fic". I find that it's more of a very common pattern. Do you find that most Gray!Harry fics aren't actually like that?

I think we are operating on different frequency here. In some fics Harry, due to some incident/epiphany/outside influence/loss/rage, decide to call bullshit on Dumbledore. These fics are more common. Sometimes these fics involve Weasely bashing too, using coincidences from start of Book 1 (and Molly's confession of brewing a love potion in 2nd book, or her keeping Harry's Trust Vault Key), along with Dumbledore bashing.

Harry was a teenager. His hogwarts life is during 11 to 17. His early life wasn't easy. And in Book 5 Dumbledore admitted that he knew Harry's life was going to be hell but he kept Harry there anyway because 'greater good' declared he will be safe from Voldemort and his followers. Even Mrs Figgs admitted that she knew, when asked why she didn't do anything, she said "orders from Dumbledore'.

Some fics use these things and create a reactive Harry who decides to 'save' and 'protect' Wizarding world from Dark Lord Voldemort and a manipulative old man.

Gray!Harry is a different matter. It's Harry that doesn't shy away from slytherin, won't shy away from using dark spells and practically follows the "Knowledge and power are neither good nor bad. It is the motive and the application that determine whether these are good or bad" philosophy.

He doesn't bends over to appease people who turn away and point finger at every 'Hunt Harry' opportunity. He doesn't 'protect' people who would rather run away and cower than fighting. It's about fighting fire with fire instead of fighting fire with dropping trousers and sitting on it, laughing like a loon and hoping that your fat will have enough CanbonDiOxide to cute the oxygen, or, in magical terms, throwing tickling charms at death eaters and sending under trained kids to war or orchestrating epic dark lord possessed professor vs 11 year old boy war for an object of immortality hoping that 'love' will help save the day.

My point is that different communities within the fandom have different fanons. Some have the "next incarnation of Merlin"; others "Dumbledore's ass licker".

Canon is ambiguous, since Harry doesn't actually pay much attention to what Hermione is up to most of the time. For example, she had little trouble getting students from other Houses into the inaugural DA meeting in OotP, which suggests that she has at least friendly acquaintances and people willing to trust her. For that matter, those traits of hers you dislike so much could have actually been advantageous in making friends in one of the less easy-going Houses, like Ravenclaw and Slytherin.

In any case, I kind of agree with you. Some of the most interesting Hermione-centric fics are ones where Harry and Ron aren't even on her radar, so she develops other relationships, positive and negative.

What you describe isn't a symptom of child abuse; it's a symptom of being 11 and finding yourself in a literal fairy tale, where /you/ are the destined hero. Heck, neither Ron nor Hermione nor anyone else Harry knew thought there was anything particularly wrong (though, I guess, Hermione questioned Dumbledore's motives in PS). Pretty much the only ones who actually thought that there was a problem were Dumbledore himself and maybe Molly.
