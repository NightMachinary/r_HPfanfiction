Like the title says what's the best muggle AU story you read, or even if the story wasn't the best but the setting or concept was good?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13618513/1/half-awake-and-almost-there][half awake and almost there]], written by the author of "The Changeling", is a very nice Harry/Ginny romance

** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/story.php?no=30822]["Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived"]]. Set in a world where Hogwarts is Harworts, a school for James Bond-style spies (with Q Tech), covers all seven years and is complete. Part of a crossover universe that includes canon HP in earlier and later works. Follows roughly canon, but with enough deviations to keep you wondering. Great Dumbledore there, too.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12217281/]]) Basically Remus is the host of a Serial-type podcast and he investigates the case of Sirius Black. I normally don't like muggle AUs but this is so incredibly well done I've re-read it several times

  R/S Games 2017 - Day 6 - Team SiriusRemus Lupin, host of the popular podcast Retrial, decides to focus on the case of Sirius Black, a man convicted of murdering his high school best friend, for his upcoming season. Remus has gotten too close to his subjects in the past, so he promises himself that won't happen this time.

** R v Riddle by devdevlin >> linkffn(13103647); dark and tragic AU, which I enjoyed immensely (especially because I'm a fan of crime fiction).

  Hermione Granger had always aspired to become a better lawyer than her mentor, but being appointed to defend the accused serial killer Lord Voldemort was not how she imagined getting there.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

** This one has a pretty unique concept--I've certainly never seen one like it--and the setting is just so immersive. The characters are all drawn really well too, and it's just a beautiful fic overall. I think it's incredibly underrated.

  Wolfstar Games 2020 - Team Sound / Prompt: typewriter “Lupin didn't seem pleased that I was filming last night,” Sirius said lightly.“Most people that come here...” Lily spoke slowly, choosing her words carefully, “Remus put it like this to me once: most people who choose to spend years of their life so far from civilization have a reason for leaving it behind. Remus wanted someone like us and he held out for so long because he expected he would get sent a bunch of finicky artsy types. I don't think he expected you. And now that you're here, I don't think he quite knows what to do with you.”  When wildlife filmmaker Sirius Black arrives on a remote Antarctic island for a year-long assignment, he isn't phased by the freezing wind, the perpetual darkness, or the hostility he meets from some of the biologists at the research base. He is used to living an itinerant existence. He is comfortable with unforgiving conditions. He expects the world to treat him harshly. But he does not expect to fall in love.
