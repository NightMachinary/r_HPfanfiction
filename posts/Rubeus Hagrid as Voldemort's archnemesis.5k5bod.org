Hagrid and Voldemort's first major encounter was when the latter, as Tom Riddle, framed the former for Myrtle's killing and being behind the Chamber of Secrets incident, quite a while before Voldemort's big first blood war.

Aside from that; one is a half-blood (pretending to be a pureblood), the other's a half-giant.

One sees creatures and people only as slaves and tools, the other loves creatures of all kinds and tries to understand them.

One's a master of magic and the Dark Arts, the other has less than half of a formal magical education (but IS magic resistant).

And, one ends up lean and bald, the other's bulky and extra hairy.

Does anyone know any stories where Hagrid is a serious archnemesis to Voldemort? Tanking the lesser spells of his death eaters, undermining Voldemort's control over various dark creatures, embarrassing the pureblood establishment, etc?


** Also by age 70 Riddle looks inhuman and old combined and Hagrid at the same age has a boyish face and full head of hair and beard. And Tom's father left his mother where Hagrids mother left his father.

**** Cue the music

/They're Hagrid and the bald. Hagrid and the bald/

/One is rather crazy, the other one is not./

(I suck at music-writing)

***** Eh, save /that/ melody for a Hermione/Winky team-up. Winky & the Brain.

...Dammit, now I want to see Pinky & The Brain cross over with Harry Potter. Two laboratory mice, whose genes have been spliced (botched transfiguration?), unfurl plans to conquer the wizarding world.

****** I know it feeds a few bad tropes but still...

Luna, are you pondering what I'm pondering?

I think so Hermione, but what if the hippogriff won't wear the beach thong?

** Hey, I've got more thoughts; think about what Hagrid does in the books.

** 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section
   :END:
Book 1? He's the one that delivers Harry to the Dursleys, brings him FROM the Dursleys to Diagon Alley, and is responsible for taking the philosopher's stone before Quirrel can get it.

And, he's the one that Voldemort targets for information, the one that goes after whoever's attacked a unicorn in the forest, and has a way enough with beasts to get Fluffy to act as a guard dog.

** 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section-1
   :END:
Book 2? Hagrid gets almost as many clues as Harry and co. do; he was around the last time the Chamber was opened, he knows the roosters are being killed, and he knows that spiders flee from whatever /it/ is in the Chamber.

Potentially, the reason he was sent to Azkaban wasn't just because he was falsely accused of opening the Chamber last time, it might have been because the Riddle Diary saw him as a serious threat and sent off an owl.

** 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section-2
   :END:
Book 3? Hagrid inadvertently gives away the truth about Sirius to Harry, but more importantly, he's responsible for finding Scabbers/Pettigrew after he faked his death the 2nd time, enabling the last act to occur.

Book 4? Helps Harry by showing him the dragons. And is moral support, I suppose.

Book 5? Easily manages to handle a whole stack of wizards and Umbridge trying to capture him all at once (although they weren't using very varied magic). Also, manages to trek through snowy mountains to negotiate with giants, and brings one home.

You get the idea, right? Also, not forgetting that Hagrid shows considerable magical ability in his first appearance, giving Dudley a pig's tail, lighting a fire, making a boat move...without saying any incantations, mind...he's actually a pretty tough wizard.

*** Hmm...you've got a great point...a 3rd year student couldn't manage human transfigeration, not even Hermione. Dumbledore totally taught him on the sly.

It just occurred to me that Hagrid didn't actually intend to turn him into a pig, he just said that to make Harry laugh.
