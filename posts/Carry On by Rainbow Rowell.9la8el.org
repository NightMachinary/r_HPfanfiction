What's everyone's opinion on this book? It is pretty much a published, thinly veiled Drarry Vampire!Draco fanfic.

Personally it's one of my favorite books. Chapter 61 gets me every time.


** /Carry On/ was a fun read, but the fanfic inspiration was so obvious that it also ended up having some of the exact same problems that I tend to have with Drarry fanfic (and most Slytherin-centric fanfic, tbh).

I think JKR made some unfortunate choices on a meta-narrative level with the Slytherins by implying that the entire house of 11-18 year old children was evil, but a fair number of Slytherin fans and shippers try to fix JKR's flaws but instead end up accidentally implying that the Slytherin emphasis on blood purity was somehow justified and correct. I don't want to say too much and spoil people who haven't read it, but I thought /Carry On/ had the same problem with its meta-narrative as a lot of Slytherin-centric fanfic. If the fanfic inspiration was less obvious, it might have bothered me less, but as it was, there were too many parallels for me to overlook it.

On the other hand, I did heartily approve of the canon slash, and 100% understand the impulse to just say fuck it and publish a thinly disguised fanfic to make my favorite ship canon forever. If somebody of Rowell's talent took on, say, Wolfstar, I'd be thrilled. :D

There were also some differences I really liked. The magic system was pretty cool, for example.

*** JKR had a lot of plot holes, that's why in fanon, Slytherins are almost always stressed to be /ambitious/, not evil. Heck, that's why fanon /exists./

Completely agree. I rather like Muggle-Hating-Harry fanfics, it's true humans will shun anyone who is different from them. But blood purity is just dumb, there is no evidence whatsoever. I don't see where this popped up in Carry On though?

*** Well, to be fair canon Slytherin is a shithole and pretty much all Death Eaters come from there (besides Pettigrew, but he joined out of selfish reasons and not due to the ideology). The ambition to purge or subjugate a race excludes them from Gryffindor and Hufflepuff while the belief in pureblood supremacy makes Ravenclaw impossible.

** I read it last year and enjoyed it! It took a while to get going, and the whole universe took some getting used to as I kept on thinking of it as the HP world when it's actually quite different, but overall I liked it. I've read some better fanfics though. I'll read the sequel when it comes out for sure!

*** Oh gosh the sequel... I'm so excited! Yah, the first ~180 pages were just Simon going "Where is Baz? Is he plotting?" And then Baz comes in and BAM all the action starts.

Yeah there are totally better fanfics. Funny, comparing fanfiction to published works. They could've made millions by publishing their work with different names (eg. Fifty Shades) but they didn't. They just got thousands of reads online instead.

I quite liked the little niche elements that made Carry On different from Harry Potter. The existence of Numpties, the floor of that one building that echoes what happens on the floor above, the use of a belt buckle to channel magic, that was just so refreshing to see!

** I quite liked it but actually the HP fic part was actually hardest too ignore, I spent too long constantly in the back of my head trying to draw parallels between this character and that character, which if the famous fanfic had been something less closely linked to HP Id have enjoyed it more for its own merits

*** I saw fangirl lying around at my local library and got it out cause of the title. Somehow found myself liking the snippets of Cath's fanfics more than the actual book Fangirl :D so i searched up Carry On to see if anyone had written a fanfic or something... Turns out that Rainbow had written and published Carry On!

Though I found Fangirl in a bookstore while I was hanging out in London waiting to go see Cursed Child, and one of my friends recommended Fangirl.

****** I almost hate to say it, but it was AMAZING. Absolutely bloody brilliant, on stage. I loved it!

That's not to say that I consider it canon or anything, heh, and the time turning plot is still awful, but it's not as... noticeable on stage? The production was SO good, just reading the script doesn't make Cursed Child justice at all. I would've gone again if it wasn't so hard to get tickets.

If they'd told another story, free from time turners and Cedric turning into a Death Eater, I would've been a huge fan of CC.

******* I reread it last night. The whole Cedric thing felt so awkward?? And "Voldemort's Daughter" felt like some crappy self-insert. But I do believe it would be better on stage, it was written for the stage, not for reading. It's just... I've read better post-DH fanfiction. Everything in Cursed Child felt like a forced money-grab

** I love this book. My sister recommended it to me because she knew I'd love Baz. I had trouble getting into it at first but when I did I devoured it. I've been in the fandom for awhile now, it's pretty small and the crowd is younger, but there are a few good writers and some decent fics if you know where to look.

**** I exclusively get my fics on AO3.

My favourite is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14087187][I Believe this is Yours]] , but everything that author writes is great. Most of the fics in the fandom are on the shorter side and she's got a few long ones which are excellent. There's this [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/235212][series]] which was written in 2015 before Carry On actually came out, based on Fangirl interpretations which I love because of the author's interpretation of Baz.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5033758][This]] is like the most popular one because it's good and it was one of the first, but it's great. There's a few other "True Love's Kiss" fics on AO3 that I like because I'm a sucker for that trope.

I dont actually follow anyone but dancingwdinosaurs on insta because I like to keep my real life and fandom life separate. I write in the fandom and wouldn't want anyone I know IRL to be able to find me somehow through things I like or people I follow. I have an aesthetic tumblr I used to follow everyone on there. I've considered making a writing specific tumblr to be more active but I'm kind of old and not sure I have the time/energy to keep it up.

** I read Fangirl first and adored it, so I didn't mind Carry On feeling fanfic-y. Carry On is a fanfic in the world of Fangirl, so it all worked!

I enjoyed Carry On, but mostly because of the context of Fangirl, I think. I'm not sure it really has enough depth to stand on it's own.
