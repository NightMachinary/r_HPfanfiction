So the ghosts at Hogwarts all seem, if not as generally friendly as Nearly Headless Nick and the Fat Friar, at least harmless to the students and staff.

However, is it possible that there are much, much scarier ghosts out there in the Wizarding World? Some of the things I've wondered about include:

1. The Shrieking Shack. Reputed to be the most haunted dwelling in Britian, and people are terrified of it. Why? If ghosts are all like Hogwarts ghosts, just drifting through you and harmless, why are people so scared of the Shrieking Shack?

2. Moaning Myrtle. She seems to have some poltergeist-like abilities in affecting her environment. She can splash water, at least. Also she originally followed and harassed the girl she blamed for teasing her, Olive Hornby, for years until Olive went to the Ministry of Magic for help. After that Myrtle was confined to Hogwarts. So some ghosts can get so bad that the Ministry of Magic has protocol and spells for dealing with them.

3. The werewolves in the Forbidden Forest. This is just a thought, but for years everyone thought that Draco talking about werewolves in the forest was just a dumb rumor, but then it comes out on Pottermore that there actually are extra-intelligent wolves, born of a werewolf couple, living there. So that brings me back to the shrieking shack- I'm thinking people really do have a reason to be afraid of ghosts. It's not just wizards being dumb.

If I were writing a story were one character is tricking another into thinking that he's being haunted by someone he killed, what do you think would be reasonable for the murderer to fear from the ghost?

** Can't answer for any of the others, but there is a canon answer to number 1.

In POA and later HBP it's revealed that the shrieking shack was thought of as haunted because of the noises caused by the werewolf transformation of Remus Lupin. Under permission of Dumbledore, Remus used the shack every month during his transformation in order to keep the rest of the students safe. This went on when he was a student, and presumably continued when he came back to Hogwarts as Defense professor during POA.

*** Yes, most of us are familiar enough with canon to know that Remus used the shack to transform. I think the point the OP was making is that throughout the books people seem inclined to stay away from the shack and frequently say that 'It's haunted' as if that were a problem. If you went to school and had a house ghost for 7 years, had Peeves trying to prank you and had headless hunts charging through the corridors then why would you be put off visiting a place because it was 'haunted'. It makes no sense.

**** Nah think about this though, when Remus first started using it all shrieking and howling people probably where like wtf?! Then they go up there and this place is ripped to shreds with no one there. Somehow they don't make the full moon assumption. So all they have is freaky howls and shrieks, a place that is ripped the fuck up, and no sign of life. The quickest answer is a malevolent ghost.

The only place we have experience with ghosts is Hogwarts, and it stands to reason that the ghosts there would be benevolent. Any malevolent spirit would probably be removed as a threat to the student population.
