Hi, so recently I've been reading some dark harry and peverell family fanfics and I love them so much. But, I can't find any more good ones so could you please send me fic recs. I'd prefer if they were completed or have consistent uploading and also maybe some dumbledore bashing if it's not too much to ask for. Please and Thank you. :) <3

  Harry is the younger brother of the Boy Who Lived and is a little strange. He hears voices no one else can hear, he knows things no one else should know and he's just this side of crazy. Oh, and everyone thinks he's a squib. When it comes to Harry, however, all bets are off and nothing is entirely certain.

Harry's a necromancer and has two favorite uncles/friends - Ignotus and Cadmus. It's a brilliant work.
