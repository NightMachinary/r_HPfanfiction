Hey guys! I was hopeful that any of y'all might have anything good hidden in your sock drawers. I've scoured ao3 and ff.net with very little luck but as they're both decently old fandoms I was hopeful that there might be some on other sites or even just one I missed. I'll take anything!

** I've found very few crossovers, so I'm keen for any good suggestions also.

I don't know if you found this group or not, but I'm not sure how many of them are any good. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/Harry-Potter-and-Chronicles-of-Narnia-Crossovers/224/1043/]]

I found this one the other day if you're interested, there are some spelling/grammar issues but the story is coherent and pleasant to read.
