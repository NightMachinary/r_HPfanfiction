Harry creates a 'gun'/projectile launching device that shoots port keys. He also hits Voldemort and when he falls into the liquid hot molten magma in the volcano his soul/spirit is trapped in the cooling magma. Susan Bones is also figures into the story. Thanks all.


** The portkey idea sounds interesting enough, but "He also save Amelia Bones from being taken by Dumbledore"? Eh?

*** I wondered about that part as well. I mean, I think that Dumbledore is vastly overrated but this is probably some of the most "over the top" Dumbledore bashing out there because I cannot imagine a situation in which this becomes necessary unless Dumbledore wants to take over the ministry.

**** See here's the thing. Dumbledore's already taken over the ministry but the Dumbledore you're thinking of hasn't. Like ay sufficiently competent wizard nazi Dumbledore cloned himself so he produce the perfect ubermensch to carry on his legacy. Well, more him taking over their bodies to reign unbroken but that's besides the point. So since he thinks that mpreg is icky because he doesn't want to have to be in a body that was once covered in shit he clones a female version of himself. That Dumbledore is Amelia Bones. She rebelled against him because she wants to have Gellert's children so now they're locked in a proxy war and the loser will likely be forced to bear the other's children. Voldemort was but a single pawn in their grand scheming.

Anyway I guess what I'm trying to say is that when [[/u/Achille-Talon]] said "taken" he didn't mean it in the way you thought he did.

  The future is lost, so to save it, both Harry and Dumbledore go back the moment it all began - that Halloween night. Of course, things do not go exactly as they had expected. Unspeakables, Wild Magic, Time Travel, Vampires, Bonds, Goblins.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.
