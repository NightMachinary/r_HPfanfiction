The Weasley's don't have to be major characters, though they can be. I'm just so tired of authors bashing the Weasley's, whenever I see it, I click off.

Now, in characters not liking each other: Like the Malfoys and Weasleys, are one thing, but an author going out of their way to make the Weasley's look bad, is a no go.

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can be any length, can be completed or not.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash/Threesomes and the like.

I'm fine with Dumbledore bashing, if need be, but in general I don't like when authors use bashing as a clutch.


** I can't say that I've ever read a fic where the Weasleys were bashed - if you can narrow down your preferences a bit more (even to era, I guess) I can give you some recs. Or my bookmarks (all one-shots or completed fics) are [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/unspeakable3/bookmarks][here]]!

  AU: The first friend Harry Potter made on the Hogwarts express wasn't Ronald "Ron" Weasley; it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter of the Weasley clan. And all of a sudden, the future looked very different.Join the newly-formed "Potter's Gang" (consisting of Harry, Ronnie, Hermione and Neville) in their first year at Hogwarts as they get into all kinds of misadventures, and maybe have to face a certain Dark Lord before they're ready for it.First novel in the "Weasley Girl" trilogy. Fem!Ron, but not a romance, and not a canon rehash.

** That's . . . not a problem I ever had. Excuse me to ask but do you mainly read Harmony? I think it's where Ron is the most bashed since a lot of authors want to push him out of the picture before the ship happen. Though he also get a fair share of hate from the Haphne story, where Daphne prove that Ron "The-Slimy-Snake-Hater" is a terrible friend and show Harry how much better she and her friends are.

Anyways, linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13224282/1/Powerful-Magical-Artifact][Powerful Magical Artifact]] ) has one of the best Ron I ever saw (sadly the story only has one chapter), but you will probably need to be a little more specific about your preferences if you want to get good recommendation. Do you have a genre you want to read, or a specific ship?

  The Goblet of Fire is a powerful magical artifact. Powerful enough to lock four powerful magicals to a binding magical contract even when one is unwilling. What else can it do to fulfill a contract? Pull someone to fulfill a contract from a distance? Reach across space and time? Summon the dead?

*** I don't read Harmony actually. But some stories I've read where Dumbledore is bashed, will have the Weasley's bashed, sometimes the author doesn't even say "character bashing" and will just put it in the story.

**** Ah, the good old "/I don't bash him, I just treat the character like he deserves to be treated/", haven't seen it in a while.

If you like Manipulative! Dumbledore, linkffn( [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10709411/1/Basilisk-born][Basilisk-born]] ) both has that and Good! Weasley (though they are pretty minor characters into this fic).

  Fifth year: After the Dementor attack, Harry is not returning to Hogwarts -- is he? ! Instead of Harry, a snake moves into the lions' den. People won't know what hit them when Dumbledore's chess pawn Harry is lost in time... Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!
