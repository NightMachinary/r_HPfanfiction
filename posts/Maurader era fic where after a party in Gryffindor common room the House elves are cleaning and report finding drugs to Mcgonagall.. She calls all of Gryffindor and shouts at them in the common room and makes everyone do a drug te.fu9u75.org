** Was it a magical drug test? Because the muggle way was expensive and a pain in the ass to do back then (being invented in '66).

ANYWHO~

Sirius tested positive for Anise. James was mad that his animagus form doesn't have an herb he could get addicted to like McGonagall and Sirius.

McGonagall was mad that she didn't ask the elf in question to fully explain itself before running off in a fury. Because those drug tests are expensive and came out of her paycheck. For the next four years.

â€‹

TL;DR: Sirius was getting high on Anise, the Dog version of catnip.
