nothing against crack, but crack fics are written in this snippets form I don't quite like. where you have a scene and you have a line and then there is a new scene. and it's generally written in snippets instead of a continuous story.

crack also tends to be really nonsensical with very little story and are more of a parody.

so are there fics that are very funny but not written in snippets and have an actual story? fics that you would not describe with the word crack and yet make you laugh a lot.


** I don't know if you'd consider this crack or not (it has a plot but some of the dialogue is a bit crackish), but [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24841198][this fic is funny]].

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

  Point of deviation: Harry's primary school taught Home Economics. Harry's not going to let the wonders of magic take away his common sense, and if he can get a good deal, he's going to take it. Meanwhile, money is fun, but magic is funner. AU

**** I don't think he was eccentric, so much as the victim of unlikely circumstances. For example, he didn't go looking for the secret passages his first morning, but accidentally ended up in them and took hours to find his way out. He just rolled with the punches instead of struggling against them.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.
