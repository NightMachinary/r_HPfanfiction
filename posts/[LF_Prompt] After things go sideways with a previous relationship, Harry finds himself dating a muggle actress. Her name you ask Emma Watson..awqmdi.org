** I have this idea before:

13 (a magically significant number) years after the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry was catapulted into an alternate universe during a mission. This new world had no magic, and to his surprise, his stories were being told in a children's series, albeit with some major changes.

He then confronted its author, and identified her as a witch from his world. She agreed to split her earning with him. Suddenly very rich, Harry established a tech company there and tried to find qualified scientists who could help him to get back home. Several fruitless years later, Harry was watching the Harry Potter Movies one night out of pure boredom and became captivated with Emma Watson's performance.

‚ÄúIf my Hermione were just this cute‚Äù thought himself. He decided to look more into Emma's career, and the more he knew, the more he was impressed with her. ‚ÄúShe's really like Hermione! With my magic helping her, I could achieve a lot in this world than mine!‚Äù

So after a few days preparation, Harry sought a meeting with Emma through her agent...

***** Canon Harry is actually very superficial. He only sought out hot, fun Quidditch girls, and he had that hair fetish thing. Cho was hot, but not fun enough, so she got dumped for Ginny.

He routinely dissed not the most attractive girls in his thoughts. Hermione was ‚Äúbushy haired with very large front teeth‚Äù. Luna had ‚Äúmad protuberant eyes‚Äù. Pansy was simply ‚Äúpug faced‚Äù.

He might have changed somewhat after the war, but we readers wouldn't know.

I can totally see Harry making a move on one of the hottest woman in our world, if he gave up the hope of returning home.

***** Harry wasn't exactly attracted to Cho because of her fine Ravenclaw mind.

****** Harry was attracted to Cho not just because of her beauty either. Else why wasn't he attracted to Fleur, when she is more beautiful than Cho?

It's because she seems kind, polite, smart, plays quidditch and is seeker as well. His crush on Cho attraction due to "similarity".

Infact Harry loved Ginny, because she is so similar to Ron. üòÇüòÇ

+That's also the reason why I don't like convenient pairings+
