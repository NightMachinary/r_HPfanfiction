I'm looking for fics where Harry was born a year or two before his canon counterpart. I don't mind bashing all that much and I've already read Harry Potter and the Veela and that fic where Gabrielle becomes a nut crushing attack dog.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

*** This story is one of my absolute favorites, it pains me that there is only 11 chapters.

On a side note; will you ever work on 'The One He Feared' again?

**** I believe he's said he doesn't plan on doing so since he wrote himself into something of a corner with the ending of the MoM battle.

From his bio: "The One He Feared. Probably my best story from the standpoints of technical writing, characterisation, humour, and action. Unfortunately, it has a fatal flaw: I was too clever for my own good when I came up with the plan, and now realise that putting your climax at the end of the first third of the story isn't a great idea. I'm honestly not sure if there's anything I can do to fix the story, but I am at least happy that the story as it currently exists tells a semi-contained arc with its own climax."

  Born two years earlier, the prophecy holds no sway over Harry Potter, but life has never been easy for Potters. How will a smart, and independent Harry, fit into the wizarding world? Will he conform or will he resist the manipulations of Voldy, Dumbles, and the Ministry? Harry/Fleur eventually. OCs major part of the story. More inside. Revised and updated.

  If Harry's baby brother, Daniel, is the Boy-Who-lived, then what of Harry? What is his role? Is he destined for greater? Or, is he to play a much bigger role in the future? Follow Canon's plot, with much bigger AU's plot as the story progresses.
