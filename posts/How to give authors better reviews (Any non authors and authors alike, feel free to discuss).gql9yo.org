** Nearly everyone appreciates praise, but not everyone appreciates criticism.

This may seem obvious, but if you do offer criticism, try to keep it about the actual text itself, and not the writer's ability, and even if you do that, be prepared for the author to dislike or(far more likely) ignore your review.

** Something I like to do when reviewing is pointing out something about the chapter or story that I like. For example, character dynamics or world building, I like to point out that I enjoy how such elements are handle as a way to encourage the authors to continue trying to use such elements.

** Be polite. That's all.

If an author is an arrogant arsehole who thinks you must kiss the dirt under his/her feet (unfortunately the most of them are), no amount of good things will sugar a couple of critic words.

** Compliment sandwiches work when you have to criticize someone and you want to help them accept it. But you don't have to criticize a fic, so I think it's the wrong attitude to reviewing, going in with the intention to criticize. Fanfic authors are working for love, remember. I'd say, check the author's notes for something saying "concrit welcome". If you don't see that, ask in your review. "Here's what I liked. Do you want constructive criticism? Great story, thanks for sharing."
