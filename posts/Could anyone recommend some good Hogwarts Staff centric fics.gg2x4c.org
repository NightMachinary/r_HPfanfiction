I absolutely love Just A Random Tuesday and want to read more stuff like it, with the focus being on the staff rather than the kids. I also liked the sort of friendship between McGonagall and Snape, so anything with that also counts.


** McGonagall gets a complex backstory here:

  A VERY long Tuesday in the life of Minerva McGonagall. With rampant Umbridgeitis, uncooperative Slytherins, Ministry interventions, an absent Dumbledore and a schoolwide shortage of Hot Cocoa, it's a wonder she's as nice as she is.
