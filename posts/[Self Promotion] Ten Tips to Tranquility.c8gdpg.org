Months ago, someone posted on here with a link to the DLP forum and asked for people to consider submitting to their most recent writing competition. I saw the post, checked it out, and was pretty interested! So I wrote a story and submitted it, not thinking much would happen. I'm pleased and surprised to say that I ended up winning the competition!

I never would have seen the competition if not for this subreddit, so I figured I should also post the story here in case people wanted to give it a read.

I hope you enjoy!

Edit: disregard this, I suppose. Just see somebody else has already posted it as a recommendation. Sorry for inundation you all with this on accident!
