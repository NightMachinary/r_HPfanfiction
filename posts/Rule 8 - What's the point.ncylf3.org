** I'm probably wrong but they way it's worded makes it sounds like it's only geared toward sex involving minors. So no lemons with underage characters (regardless of whether or not their partner is also underage or not and regardless of if there even is a partner). So, based on what I can tell, adult and underage ships aren't against /this/ rule as long as there aren't any underage characters involved in the sex scenes. (Again, I could be wrong, but that's what it looks like to me.)

** As a Snarry shipper, I'm curious - how often do Snarry fics with actual underage content get linked here? In my experience, this sub usually brings up Snape/Harry in order to bash it and sneer at it. Most of the members have never actually /read/ a Snarry fic in their lives, let alone considered recommending it as a good read. And when I say "Snarry fic," I mean all those post-canon works with adult Harry and Snape. By no stretch of the imagination can they be called "pedophilia." You may not like reading cross-gen fic, you may even object to its very existence, but it's not reportable.

So I ask: where /are/ all these discussions and direct links of underage Snarry fic that break the sub rules? Because I confess to being baffled by this claim.

** Without making this thread devolve into a ship argument/flamewar, while it's true that /some/ fics among the ships you mention are cases that would violate Rule 8, not /all/ fics do. Take SSHG for example: there's a lot of SSHG fics that basically amount to teacher/student fantasies. Such an example would almost always violate Rule 8, aside from corner cases (there are some fics involving a "8th-year" Hermione, and while I personally find such fics problematic and still avoid them, they wouldn't violate Rule 8). Meanwhile, there are other fics, specifically postwar SSHG ones, where they are both consenting adults. Whether you like the ship or not, such an example doesn't violate Rule 8.

You are correct that this rule is poorly enforced beyond the most egregious cases (DPSW which contains massive grooming), but as long as you report cases that violate it, they should go away once a mod looks into it. They can't reasonably track every single post in this sub, there's just too many of them. I suspect the reason DPSW specifically is hit consistently by the rule is because it's reported more.

** Well, considering how annoyingly happy a lot of the people in the HP fandom are with very graphic sexual content, featuring uncomfortably young individuals, and the sheer number of those kind of fics, it's probably a lost cause.

That being said, a lot of those fics are written by teens, who may not necessarily understand why these stories are kind of icky for normal adults.

I mean, sure, there's the whole debate that those are fictional characters and all that, but OP here isn't asking for everyone to not write/read fics like, they're asking that people follow the goddamn rules of the sub and don't post or link (to misquote OP) "pedophilic" content here. If they want to find or link some Tomarry, Snarry, Snamione, Bellamione, Tomione or whatever other ship that involves a minor and an adult, then they can find a community that allows it.

*** There aren't a lot of fics like that I am not saying that there are no underage sex fics there but its actually a small number. There are 312988 fics on Ao3 for HP fandom out of which 130 fics have the extremely underage tags so thats not even 1% of the fics. For the underage tag on Ao3 there are 13493 fics so that's around 4.3% now in the underage tags you also have Harry/Ron, Harry/Hermione etc the same age characters. I not saying there aren't HPSS, HPLV or HGSS etc but that is all included in that 4%. So no people actually dont support pedophilia and maybe the downvotes are because of your ignorance and not because they are "closet pedophiles"
