Taking [[/u/__pers]] [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2iu266/how_do_you_write/cl5oh12][advice]] I'm sketching out the general plot of the fic that I was considering writing for [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2jmps5/who_is_participating_in_nanowrimo_anybody_want_to/][NaNoWriMo]] and writing some of the interesting scenes that spawned the idea in my head in the first place.

Given that this is my first attempt at anything like this, and I know i'm going to want feedback on how well it works:

Are there any general guidelines for how to go about soliciting feedback and or finding someone interested in being a beta?

Are there any common pitfalls that should be on the lookout for? be it avoiding cliches or forgetting to do something that I don't know is important.

--------------

An example of forgetting something important being that I almost forgot to include what my idea was: Tom Riddle, after finding out what happened to his older incarnation, takes a step back and tries to gather more information before setting up any confrontations (no releasing the basilisk /cough/ kraken /cough/ without knowing what happened.) Unbeknownst to Tom at first, he begins picking up odd character traits from the people he leeches [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2jixzq/difficult_selfinsert_character_replacements/clcpitw][Soul Juice]] from. By the time he realizes whats going on his rather patchwork soul has lost all interest in serving as his older self's means of resurrection, and he strikes out on his own, viewing Harry as an potential ally of convenience (you try absorbing parts of Ginny's soul and not winding up with a positive opinion of Harry) against any attempts by Voldemort to cram him back into the diary. I expect it may wind up reading like a cross between canon and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][the tale "that fucker" tells Harry in NonJon's A Black Comedy]]

I figure Tom would still be after the DADA professorship and wind up possibly signing on as Remus's TA (since he's only 16 and cant apply for the post itself.) As a bonus, it then becomes against the rules of his position to date a student, allowing me to table The scene I have written so far has Tom walking in to the classroom mid lesson and having a boggart banished into his face.

I'm both amused and leery at the same time of having Tom's cover story be as a Mr. Evans, claiming to be from a branch of lily's family that migrated to the states all of whom descend from a Gaunt squib that avoided being murdered. It may or may not prove true, but Tom would make it up as a lie in an attempt to insert himself into Harry's life.

I suspect my biggest problem will be that I haven't sorted out exactly how I want it to end. I was thinking that Tom would start out rather magically weak, and recover his strength as he slowly rebuilt his soul reabsorbing Voldemort's Horcruxes, but I don't know if that would drive him back into the darkness as he integrates more and more of Voldemort. But does this lead to Tom becoming Voldemort once more (cue showdown with Harry) or just a DADA professor who struggles to control his inner demons.

--------------

Does any of this sound even remotely interesting? I feel like I'm just rambling now. <edit> The concept started as a Self Insert hypothetical, but I think I like it better as a non-SI since Tom knowing not where Voldemort put the horcruxes makes him do some actual work to find them. All he knows is that he was planning to make 7, and there's clearly one in Harry.


** I like it, but I'm picky.

Soul juice sounds... icky. Personally, I think it also implies more corporeality in souls than what I would expect (/people drink juice etc.../).

/Thus,/ I would personally use other terms, such as:

- Diary soul is /tainted/ by soul /outpourings/ from those who write in it (going along with /juice/ line mildly)

- Ingest(?) / digest(?) / inhale(?) / absorb / leech the /excess off/ or sponge off / assimilate / consume / devour / imbibe / acquire / merely /learn/ or likewise be educated, taught, tutored, or perhaps indoctrinated.

*/ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS THAT SOUNDED COOL IN MA' HEAD:/*

- Tom finding out Harry is a horcrux allows you to play around with Harry either being trained or protected by imprisonment . . . OR (more likely) Harry rebelling against that imprisonment and demanding training instead.

- Assuming Tom was conscious and capable of existence and capable of thought when in the diary (as proven by him writing back) then we can deduce that he'll be pretty fuckin' angry at himself (other self) for not looking after him and/or not lightening his suffering (because, lets face it - he was a /book/ for /fifty years/).

- If Lucius had written in the book or Draco we could have him more interested in the political game, this would steer the book in interesting (for some) political directions.

Will add more thoughts as they come :D

*** Regarding 'soul juice' I'm quoting [[/u/timeloopedpowergamer]] who knowingly or perhaps not has helped me refine my concept quite a bit over the past few days. And I read juice as it's sometimes used colloquially for 'power' aka /eckeltricity./

My only issue with Lucius writing in the diary is that I think if I were Tom, and in the position... I'd just omnomnomnom Lucius's soul, and avoid any risk of Dumbledore exposure. Though, now that I think on it, that could be a terrible plan, since that would leave me in the body of a man bearing my elder self's mark. A mark that would make it all too easy for said elder self to crush my newly won independence. I would know, I designed the bloody things.

That might be Ginny's cue. An unmarked member of a family I can manipulate Lucius into planting me on with promises of ruining her and that dratted Muggleborn Protection Act Lucius was complaining about. For a pure blood male politician my god can that man WHINE... why did my elder self tolerate the man?

**** Yah man - brainstorm this shit.

Create reader sympathy for the soul in the diary by writing Toms' perspective from the beginning - you could divide this into chunks of writing spread years apart and have his mental state deteriorate - /WHILST/ feeling the other soul (Voldemort) wandering around - sometimes getting flashes of emotion or something like dreams.

Then the splitting of the soul which he might be able to feel - eventually the soul splitting so much that eventually Tom can't feel any piece of soul and is completely alone (did this happen when Harry became a horcrux?).

Thus as the reader we are drawn immediately into a world of lonely darkness without a companion for years, making the reader sympathize more with Tom and understanding /why/ he wants to do the things he does.

How the diary can communicate to Lucius and persuade him (let alone tell the difference between he and other people before they write in the diary), I'll leave up to you.

***** I would assume, that as in CoS, he asks new people to identify themselves, or waits for them to say something identifying. Harry wrote his name in the diary seemingly without reason... it could just be a compulsion charm to write your name and say hello. I don't know if he'd be able to sense certain things at a short distance, roughly analogous to Harry's scar-aches.

After that I'd expect he can recognize the handwriting well enough to notice if he's talking to someone new, even before they succumb to the inexplicable desire to write their name in the diary.

Lucius may have gotten wind of the coming raid on Malfoy Manor and then distractedly found himself writing in the diary while bossing Dobby around to collect all the objects that suddenly need hiding. Probably complains about Dobby's willful behavior, how he's constantly twisting his orders in spite of punishments, planting the seeds in Riddle's mind for his insurrection.

****** Too many leaps beyond normal thinking.

When the diary was created, did Voldemort write in it to see what the soul inside was capable of? Did they communicate to one another in order to see whether it could gain life by simply being written in? Did Voldemort put a compulsion on it to make it /only/ able to get the chamber open so Voldemort doesn't have a younger self on the loose? Did Riddle break this compulsion when he's resurrected?

Anyway you've given me some great ideas to build on for when I get my series to CoS stage.

******* I think the question has to be asked if Voldemort even considered the idea that his younger self could end up loose in the world. IIRC, all of his horcruxes were made with compulsions to use them. Wear the ring, put on the diadem, write in the diary. Possessing Ginny, an 11 year old, took 2-3 months. Full bore resurrection would have taken a 9 month school year. Given how he hid them, Its unlikely that any of them would have that kind of prolonged exposure to make the attempt prior to the diary. Voldemort may have just thought of them as anchors, and not really planned for anything beyond that.

I feel like the plot Riddle used in CoS was a result of his basically being a 16 year old who had been paused at the time when that was his big thing. He was The Heir of Slytherin, as proven by his finding the chamber and commanding the basilisk. When Ginny writes in the diary, he sees no reason not to resume that same behavior now that apparently 50 years have passed and people have let their guard down.

The Riddle we're describing has instead been stuck in an empty void for 50 years. His only contact with the outside word has been flashes of another version of himself. He's watched Voldemort's greatest hits reel so to speak in bits an pieces like Harry gets the dreams only with nothing in between to track how long its been. And perhaps he resents being left behind, watching his older self make some calls that he disagrees with... but his older self is winning, so its all right he supposes. Then there's a glimpse of a red haired woman defying him, a baby crying, a flash of intense pain... then NOTHING for 10 years. Maybe he assumed at first that his older self would come back for him, but he never did. He wonders what happened, but gets no answers.

Then, 10 years later, he feels someone nearby get ensnared in the compulsion charms and leaps on the chance for more information. From Lucius he finds out about his disappearance. Is he on his own now, the first and strongest of Voldemort remaining pieces? He needs more information, especially about what happened with this Potter /Baby/ that defeated the greatest wizard of all time? He sells Lucius on a plan to pass him to the Weasleys where Harry is staying.

It takes him longer than he expected to get control of Ginny, Lucius was easier than this... Lucius already wanted to follow his +orders+ ahem, suggestions. By the time he's close to doing so, he's realized that he feels not just stronger but /different/ somehow.

*** It only just dawned on me that the other obvious trait that Tom could pick up from Lucius could be his /traditionalist/(?) value set that prioritizes taking care of his family first /(and the world can burn around them for all he cares)/ Which could easily color everything else based on who he wound up adopting as his family once all the pieces shook out.

** I really like the concept as a whole, but here are my silly thoughts/comments:

- "Soul Juice" doesn't bother me, it actually made me laugh. I love the idea that he absorbs characteristics of other's. It could make him a totally new person, it can make things really interesting!
- "Mr Evans" is so overused as an alias, it's annoying, but it's usually Harry that uses it, so I'll give you a pass. Tom Riddle could actually use his real name since Voldemort has forsaken it, but then he'd have to deal with Dumbledore so I realize that isn't possible, or maybe he could make an unbreakable vow to fight for the light or such...
- Since Tom is influenced by what soul juice he ingested, shouldn't he be really infatuated with Harry? I'm not encouraging you to write slash (I'm not a fan myself) but it could be funny to see Tom struggling against his unwanted crush.
- I also like a weak-to-start-with Tom Riddle. I don't like characters always being super-powered, it's boring. Has Tom Riddle lost past of his memory/knowledge as he is only part of Voldemort's soul?

I really want to read this asap and I hope you'll post a link to your story once it's done :)

I definitely agree. Its what makes me leery of doing it. Tho, it would be less about being Mr. Evans, and more him walking up to Petunia and trying to claim being her Xth Cousin. The actual Evans name would be less important. Can't decide if its better that Tom find himself unable to enter the house for reasons he cant fathom at first, or if the blood wards accept him because a little bit of Harry's magic is in what passes for his soul. Shaking hands with Harry and immediately pulling a Quirrell would be problematic.

I think I'd prefer to assume that Ginny is still too young to have /that/ kind of crush on Harry and just avoid the whole slash concept. I don't like reading it so I can't picture myself writing it.

As for /done/ ... I cant decide if its better to try and block it off year by year, or write it all as one piece. I feel like year 2 will, by its nature, be comprised almost entirely dialog, and Tom's thoughts and feelings on the topics, since he can't "see" who he's talking to. I wonder if that might come across a touch dry if done all at once, maybe handling it in flash backs as an already escaped Tom begins his machinations based on what he learned.

** The idea I found most interesting out of all of that would be Tom picking up attributes of the people who write in the diary that he "leeches soul juice" (nice phrase, by the way) from.

I'm not quite as interested in the hypothetical plot you talked about, but that's my own bias talking; I never found Riddle to be that interesting of a character, on his own.

I could see being very interested in a restructured CoS where the diary gets passed around a little more (in canon, I believe Harry and Ginny were the only ones to actually write in it.) and Riddle ends up taking on the qualities of, I don't know, Percy Weasley, Romilda Vane, Hermione Granger, and Professor Lockhart.

*** Maybe not those exact people, but that's how I see the period analogous to book 2 happening. Riddle has no real sensory perception, no information but what he's told by the people writing in the diary.

Conversations with Ginny give him the beginnings of history post-1942, and the news that his elder self lost to a /BABY!?/ are you serious?

Some compulsion charms or even just basic manipulation later and he's in Harry's hands, discovering parallels in their history. Piecing together the role Dumbledore played in Harry's early life (does it count as bashing if the character making Dumbledore out to be a villain is explicitly and willfully twisting facts to meet his goals?) Weeks pass, and Tom wonders to himself how learning about his young nemesis became trying to help free him from a home life that he is all too familiar with.

After trying to teach Harry some form of magic, Tom find himself talking to some handwriting he doesn't recognize. He learns that the Miss Granger whom Harry speaks so highly of has questions about the theory behind what he was teaching Harry.

The a question about where he keeps his brains from Ron and a hurried distraction from that notion for all Tom's worth. But he finds himself in Percy's hands nonetheless. But he knows Percy's type. Afterall, he was Head Boy himself back in '43, clearly he did something right. Percy, have you considered the following to help your selection chances?

Round and round we go until Percy remembers in spite of the compulsion charms on the diary that he is afterall supposed to turn this into the DADA professor. A professor who abandons his post towards the end of the year under strange circumstances and is never heard from again.

--------------

I'll wholeheartedly concede that Riddle as he appears in CoS isn't terribly engaging, mostly by virtue of having very little screen time.
