Does anyone know this fic? Citizen Snape *by* Lydia Lovestruck

I want to read this fiction again but not able to find it online anymore. Does anyone have a saved copy? I found the summary for it (see below). This is my first time posting in here, sorry if I break any rules unknowingly.

*Title:* Citizen Snape\\
*Author:* Lydia Lovestruck\\
*Characters:* Ron Weasley/Lucius Malfoy, Severus Snape/Remus Lupin, Severus Snape/OMC, Harry Potter, Sirius Black (UST for Ron Weasley/Severus Snape, but never amounts to much above that)\\
*Prompt:* #31-Discovery\\
*Rating:* NC-17\\
*Length:* Epic\\
*Brief summary:* To start off-warnings for mpreg (one of the most realistic and wonderfully written ones I've ever read). The story starts off with Severus Snape's death and it progresses to show Ron Weasley try to figure out the secrets Snape was holding dear. One of Snape's last words was about some mysterious Raven and Ron embarks on the quest to put the pieces of the puzzle together. He ends up finding a world of intrigue and sex that was beyond his wildest dreams. The story is above all an engaging mystery, little actual romance

**** I regret being the one to inform you of this, but /Junior/ was a /comedy./

As an aside, my "what" was concerning "the most realistic and wonderfully written" as applied to mpreg, rather than mpreg itself. Not my circus, not my monkeys.

***** Well, I know Rule 9 says its for requests, but you might have applied it to yourself here too, even if this thread is flaired differently.

Also, pretty funny that some people are still unable to grasp the meaning of "realistic" in the context of a fantasy setting lol.

** Here is a page that has the dead links to all the chapters:

[[https://ronlucius.livejournal.com/11013.html]]

And at least for the first chapter web.archive.org has a few captures from 2005:

[[https://web.archive.org/web/20051016105326/http://inkstain.inkquill.net/isf/archive/7/citizensnape.html]]

I did not test the other chapters, so I would advise you to do that before you start reading and then notice that chapter 7 or something is not available :D
