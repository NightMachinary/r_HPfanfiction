"I reckon they're trying to do you in, mate."

"Not like I've been saying it for the past couple weeks. Nope. You know what that's called in the Muggle World? Stupidity. Or, plagiarism. Take your pick."

"But, I'm your friend."

"The essential word is 'were'. You and Hermione were my friends. Now you aren't. Enjoy being Ron's owl, Hermione!"

"Harry! We didn't mean it like that, honest!"

"Yeah? Well, I think that an oversmart person like you really should have figured it out. How many times have I said it? I don't like attention!"

"Harr-"

"Mr. Potter. You can call me Mr. Potter. Actually, everybody except Hedwig can call me Mr. Potter!"

Harry walked out of the tent, Ron and Hermione closely trailing behind.

"Ya hear that you mother-whoops, can't say that. I DIDN'T ENTER MY F- I MEAN NAME INTO THE TOURNAMENT! So it's Mr. Potter to you all now!"

Harry grinned and then turned back to Hermione.

"Hedwig can't talk!"

"If you were my friend, you would have figured out ages ago that I can talk to animals."

Fast Forward-Yule Ball

"Hedwig, wanna go to the ball with me?"

/Sure!/

/"Transforma Persenno!"/ Harry said, waving his wand.

Standing in front of him was a girl with long, silvery hair and pretty amber eyes. She was easily the most beautiful girl in the school. Harry beamed.

"Hiya Harry!" Hedwig said, grinning merrily.

What do you guys think? This would be funny.


** Hermione never abandoned Harry; why would he dismiss her too?

*** In the movie in GoF, she says that she's not an owl. In addition in the movies, she seems to spend a lot of time with Ron instead, even though she knows he's in the wrong.

I know I'm depending too much on the movies, I'm sorry about that. Hermione did help him with /Accio/, but I just needed her to abandon him too for this prompt/

**** In the books, she does try to get them to talk to each other, but what stands out is that she's loyally helping Harry and yet he misses Ron because Hermione is more about studying than having fun.

** Ok, let's just turn Harry into an arrogant arse, shall we? I mean, fair enough that he's a bit reckless and thoughtless in the books, but this is a step too far.

*** If you mean that Harry doesn't deserve hate, I agree! He's my favorite character! This is just a funny spin on what could have happened if he /were/ arrogant.
