I realize this doesn't belong here, and I apologize- but it's very relevant to the HP-verse, which I think it's safe to say everyone here is a fan of, and I want it to reach as many people as possible to be effective. I'm guessing you all know Jam City released its official HP game- Hogwarts Mystery. I was hyped, so was everyone. Having played it... I'm not hyped anymore. I see many of the people that played it also share my thoughts about the game. Frustratingly blatant freemium model, immersion destroyed by artificial paywalls, experience staggeringly fragmented by illogical wait times( wait 20 minutes to get energy to look at someone or sneer? Seriously?) The game is still very new, and it's possible to push the devs to fix at least some of the issues. If any of you are familiar with what happened some time back with EA and Battlefront, fans do have the power to push a company to think twice and fix their crap. To do that- just vote, including with your wallets.

Vote low on Google Play if you don't like it. Don't just give it a great rating "because it's HP". HP or not HP, if you don't like the game itself, give it a low rate. Explain why. Explain the issues you believe are there. I'm sure the people that made it were banking of the novelty of HP, and we need to show that won't work, or we'll never get a good game.

Don't spend a dime on it. If most people don't, there will be no profits and they'll be more willing to think twice about what they're doing.

Be vocal. Express your issues when possible, on as many platforms as possible(if you have the time and want to, of course). The only way for this to have any effect is to make as many people as possible do the above 2 things, and to do that, those people need to be reached and told those things are happening. By themselves, nobody can change a thing. But if we all do a little something, we very much can.

I see too many people content with this slap in the face, because freemium has somehow become accepted as a mobile game model and because it's HP, so it gets leniency. I love HP too, but if we want a good game, we need to show that we won't tolerate mediocre, obvious cashgrabs such as this one.

It's a modern mobile game, what were you expecting?

*** That's the worst approach to it. I was expecting a good game. And until we maintain the "well it's mobile, OF COURSE it'll be a freemium" demeanor, all games will keep being like that, because "well people are okay with it so why tf not". If people actually act against it, the model would have no choice but to die out.

Also, there's a difference between a game with active microtransactions and a freemium game. There are plenty of mobile games that do have the opportunity to buy stuff and help yourself, but it's not flat out impossible to play unless you pay, as is the case in Hogwarts Mystery. Seriously, unless you shell out cash, there is liteally *nothing* you can do except either stare at the pretty picture of close the game and wait. This is combined with a model in which quests have a time limit to complete- so basically you need to wait, but if you wait too long, you lose anyway, and have to start over anyway, back in the same cicle. All designed in an extremely stupidly obvious way to eventually frustrate you into spending. It's an extremely messed up model that should be rooted out and not at all tolerated.

** Well, if there was ever any doubt that magical exhaustion is no fun...

That sucks, though.

*** It's not even magical exhaustion. Energy for casting spells- okay, I can live with that. Energy for "Look at this guy" or "Sneer" or "Inspect item" is beyond ridiculous.

**** To be fair, those all do sound like hard work. You can hardly get me out of bed in the morning without paying me first.

** I love it and Hate it for that exact reason. I will continue playing but to expect anyone to wait two hours in order to advance is kind of a garbage system. Not everyone has money they can just throw into the game to advance quickly. They need to make the goals more obtainable. Even the clothes for your character are outrageously expensive. I hope they fix this and don't keep up with this business model.

*** That's the thing. I have no problem actually spending money on games, when I like them. But I will *not* spend a bloody dime on such a ridiculous game model, and neither should anyone. Releasing a game for a flat price, or making so you can play, but paying just helps things a bit- yes. Cosmetic microtransactions- okay. But making it practically impssible to enjoy the experience without paying, while at the same time trying to pass under the guise of a free game, isn't something I'll ever stand behind.

**** Exactly! I usually don't have problems spending money either but the game is basically built so you have no choice. Ill just have to be angrily impatient as I wait to progress. Im just hopeful they will change it.

** I totally see what you mean, but I actually enjoy the game. I don't mind the wait times, I enjoy playing it when I have a few spare minutes, I enjoy the look and the music, it's laid back and easy and about my favorite books, it's a story to follow, etc. I really enjoy the "no pressure" feeling I get from playing it. The choices you make don't matter much and I get to explore a pretty 3D world and follow an adventure whenever I want. Though I didn't really follow any announcement while it was still in development so I had absolutely no idea how it was going to be, which is probably why I'm just happy with the game as it is.
