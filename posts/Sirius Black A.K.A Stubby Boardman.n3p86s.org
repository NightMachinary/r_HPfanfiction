Instead of umbridge, Sirius is the defence teacher in Harry's fifth year, but he actually goes by the name Stubby Boardman.

The Ministry repeatedly try to arrest him but he has papers saying his name is Stubby.


** "Man, who is this bloody Black guy you keep mistaking me for?" Stubby complained. "No racism or nothin', but ain't you've got eyes? I ain't black, man."

** Borrowing an idea from Clell65619's /Hiding in Plain Sight/, Sirius constructs a foolproof disguise consisting of a hair tie, a monocle and a smoking pipe.

“This photograph proves that I am not Sirius Black.” Mister Boardman said. “You can see, quite clearly, that this fellow wears his hair loose and has perfect vision in both eyes.

I, on the other hand, tie my hair back with this here blue hair tie and require the use of a monocle. Furthermore, I posses a smoking pipe while Mister Black, it seems, does not.”

** I love it because there's so much room for cracky ridiculousness.

He walks around always holding a guitar or some obscure magical instrument at all times, so you know that he's a /musician/ and not ‘this Sirius Black fellow you keep mentioning, who sounds really sexy by the way'.

Minerva stumbles across a bunch of first years beating a sixth year with guitars, ‘we're just doing what we were taught in DADA!'

** I got the idea for this from reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5915151/1/Sirius-Sets-Things-Right]] where luna calls Sirius Stubby Boardman and he even tricks Fudge into thinking he's Stubby.

** There was a stubby prompt a while back where Stubby was actually Regulus with amnesia. I turned it into a one shot.

  This started as just a response to a Reddit Prompt and turned into a One-Shot Prompt: The Quibbler is partially right about Stubby Boardman being a Black. They just got the wrong one. He's actually an amnesiac Regulus Black. Enjoy

** While it doesn't go in that direction, my story features Sirius who actually was Stubby, lead singer of the Hobgoblins. Very cracky, as you can probably guess from the title.

  This story takes the trope/cliche of Harry Potter working out to become a fitness buff to its logical and completely ridiculous endgame. Now it's time to meet Beefcake Harry, Dudebro supreme. Also starring his mentor, a great big buff guy... named Thanos. And stoner Dumbledore, because why not?
