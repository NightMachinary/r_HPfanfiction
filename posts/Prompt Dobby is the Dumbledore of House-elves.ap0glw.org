They're magically powerful, slightly insane beings with a terrible sense of fashion.


** Harry Potter sat alone in the dark room, going over the prophecy again and again.

/"The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches ... Born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies ... And the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not ... And either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives ..."/

"What possible power do I have that Voldemort knows not" he mused.

There was a sudden shuffle and Dobby emerged from the darkness.

"Socks Harry Potter. The ability to gift Socks," he whispered.

All of a sudden it came rushing back to him. That moment when Harry had asked Dumbledore what he had seen in the Mirror of Erised and Dumbledore had replied with the offhand comment about seeing himself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.

/Was he hinting at something?/, thought Harry.

It sounded crazy, but then again, Harry had thought magic was crazy until he was suddenly told he was a wizard. Certainly, Voldemort knew nothing of the kindness of gifting socks to others, and hadn't Harry freed Dobby through a sock? And Dumbledore seemed to have an unusual fascination with them and wasn't he the only one Voldemort was afraid of?

It made sense in a strange way.

Dobby meanwhile faded back into the darkness murmuring to himself.

"Purple socks and pink socks, striped socks and polka dotted socks, long socks and short socks, thick socks and thin socks..."

Harry turned to ask Dobby just how socks would defeat Voldemort but Dobby had already vanished, although Harry could have sworn he heard a whispered, "For the greater House Elf good!" from the darkness that surrounded him. However, he wasn't sure if his ears were playing tricks on him.

"Socks" Harry mused. Interesting.

  "Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?" ...Snape kicks Harry out of 'Remedial Potions', but as we know from The Philosopher's Stone, there is another Occlumens in the school good enough to keep out the Dark Lord. Stupid oneshot.
