:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I am looking for this specific creature fic (though I won't turn down any good recs). It was one of those Harry didn't know he was going to get a creature inheritance, but he tries to figure it out on his own. There was a teacher (dada i think) thta was also that type of creature who was there to help all the other like draco and blaise (?) etc while at school and he'd like give them support amd meat. But harry accidentally snubbed him because he didnt know what he was...I just can't find it.

Edit: I found it [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7892725/1/][There be dragons, harry]]

  Harry comes into a very unexpected inheritance. He is a creature both rare and very dangerous, a creature that is black listed by the British Ministry. So now he must avoid detection at all costs, whilst choosing his life partners and dealing with impending pregnancy at just sixteen. With danger coming not just from the Ministry but even other creatures, what was he supposed to do?

** linkffn(Outcast Alley) is along those lines, but I highly doubt it's the one you're primarily looking for.
