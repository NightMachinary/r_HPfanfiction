So, in the chapter of Prince of Slytherin, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin), that features the first chamber opening, after the attack, Jim notices his trunk has been broken into and his invisibility cloak stolen with a note left behind that reads:

Dear Git-Who-Lived: I so enjoyed your little prank last night. How you must have thrilled to see three little firsties (one of them your only real friend's little sister) cowering in fear of Argus Filch and nearly in tears over your handy work. Such a fine specimen of Gryffindor chivalry. Anyway, since it's now clear that your lack of honor is exceeded only by your lack of style, I thought it best to deprive you of your number one pranking aid, lest you embarrass our family name any further. Good luck proving it was me. Sincerely, You-Know-Who P.S. Slytherins Rule. Gryffindors Drool. P.P.S. Poof!

At the end it's signed 'You-Know-Who'. Jim is lead to believe that Harry is 'You-Know-Who' but, anyone who has read the story knows that it was Ron possessed by Tom Riddle who did it.

So it really was You-Know-Who.

Edit: The quote came out wrong. It was meant to be in itallics and not meant to a block of words.


** I've been overall impressed with the first two books of PoS, but the fact that the third book is like thirty chapters long and only around Christmas has put me off a bit. Am thinking I may wait until the author finishes it out before I resume.

*** You'll be waiting a few years. Yeah the pace is suuuuuuuper slow. For like four months there was a four part chapter that was dreadfully boring. It could have been cut in half if the author wasn't so focused on filler

**** I've heard that they got a bit carried away on backstories and such, is another reason I didn't wanna dive right in.

***** 's okay. That being said, you don't have to know how (or have the possibility) to put the spoiler tag. Writing down 'Spoiler for the whole story' or some variation of that in the title would have done.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
