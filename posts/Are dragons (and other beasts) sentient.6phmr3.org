As I read more and more fanfiction it makes me wonder... We know fawks is capable of comprehension of complex orders if the CoS is to be believed. We also know that werewolves have a form of intelligence as to prevent the killing of all they bite. Giants can be taught, Gawp proves this.. What of dragons?

Do you think thunderbirds are as intelligent as phoenixes?


** In my headcanon, no. I've read stories where dragons are sentient, but to me they're apex predators turned up to 11. I'd compare them to crocodiles. 10 tonne, 30-40+ foot long crocodiles with wings, the ability to breathe fire and a nastier attitude. Where crocodiles can go long periods without food because they're cold blooded, the dragons fire means they burn a lot more energy, so have to hunt much more often.

Most other named XXXXX creatures are deadly simply by being existing in your general vicinity (basilisks can kill with a glance, nundus have toxic breath, dementors weaken any ability to fight with their presence), or have high levels of intelligence (manticore) so are incredibly lethal to people. Dragons are in the same category by being vicious, highly effective killers

** Certain beasts exhibit being-level intelligence. I believe there are certain factors one needs to consider when determining which side of the line they fall under, first of which do they have a societal structure. Werewolves are only beastly on full moons, so they fall under beings I believe. Giants are beings because they have society, etc, albeit more primitive. Dragons, thunderbirds, and phoenixes are beasts because despite their intelligence, they behave as other animals do in a fashion, though as with most animals they can be trained or domesticated.

** Well, there are two categories, beings and beasts. Currently, muggles, squibs, witches and wizards, giants, werewolves when not full moon, hags, vampires, dwarves, goblins, veela, pukwudgies, curupiro, yambo, ogre, house elves, and half breeds are Beings. Acromantulas and manticores and sphinx are beasts, because of their violent tendencies.

Centaurs, Merpeople, and Leprechauns refused Being status because they didn't want equality with hags and ogres. So they are beasts, by choice. Snobs.

Interestingly, poltergeist are not spirits, which ghosts and zombies are, but non-beings, same class as dementors and boggarts

** What's the difference between an octopus and a goldfish? How about a chimpanzee and a cat?

Not all animals are equal.

Dragons look to be as smart as a wild coyote.

Fawks may be as or more intelligent than an ape but is certainly not as intelligent as a human.
