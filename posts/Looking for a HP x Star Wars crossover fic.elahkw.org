:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for a fanfic where Harry is transported to the Star Wars universe but manages to get back to Earth only to find it on the verge of devastation. He finds Hogwarts still intact thanks to its wards however even those are failing. I remember Neville being the headmaster and Luna also being there. He manages to save people from there however Neville had to stay as he's anchored the wards to his magic so that the others can survive. I believe he makes a few more stops somewhere on earth and then returns.

Anyone remember which fic this is?


** I think it's this one linkffn(10912355)

Don't remember much of it but it started with harry being enslaved for labor together with other humans and trying to escape.

  A Harry Potter cursed with immortality must not only survive the ravaging of Earth by monsters far more powerful than any humanity has encountered, but he must rise to save it, and in the process exact one wizard's revenge against the Galactic Empire.
