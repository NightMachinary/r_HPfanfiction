I was hoping someone could recommend a well-written fic where Harry, Hermione, or someone/multiple someones are the Hogwarts founder's heir. Thanks!


** linkffn(More Than Equal) is an interesting story with lots of world building, where Harry is heir of Slytherin through Lily's side. I didn't finish it but others found it pretty good.

  After the events down at the Chamber, Harry decides to become the master of his own destiny than to let others decide his fate. He learns of a different connection that he shares with Voldemort; and magic that will make him a more than equal to the Dark Lord.

** Linkffn(Wish Carefully) Has it mentioned that Harry, Hermione, and Neville are the Heirs of the Founders, which lets them strip Hogwarts bare, including taking the "Heart" that gives the school its magic. (Harry is the Heir of Gryffindor by blood, and Slytherin via the Scarcrux, Hermione is descended from a squib branch of Ravenclaw, and Neville is the Heir of Hufflepuff.)
