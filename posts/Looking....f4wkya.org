:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a specific fic I read a while ago... It's about harry living in an expanded trunk that has multiple properties, farms, lands, etc. In it. They join the trunk with Neville's as well I believe. I think it had a retreat in the trunk's mountains, and a house elf village, and at one point Dobby deconstructs and reconstructs some cars so they can drive around in the trunk. Any and all help is appreciated!
