I'm looking for fics where someone other than Harry (as in, Harry can't be time traveling. No golden trio turning back the calendar together) traveling back to Harry's time at Hogwarts or shortly before. No Riddle's school years or Marauder's school years please. Thank you!

Bonus points if it's a rarely used character


** Slytherin at War has Draco going back in time to try and rewrite history so that his family is on the winning side.

  Someone has a daring plan to go back in time and fix everything. No wait, not him, I meant the other... how many people have time traveled anyway? Poor Harry seems to be the only normal one left.

** I read my favourite list. Best one is the

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Puppet of Time)

Where Draco was dark lord and send his younger self several memories, here Draco is very strong thanks to divination.

This in one of few fics where Dumbledore is good because he is time-traveling linkffn(Dumbledore's Next Great Adventure)

Pretty funny and almost unused time-traveller is linkffn(Dobby's return)

Then there is good romance of timetraveling Draco linkffn(Draco-s-Redemption)

  Sooner or later, every character gets their shot at a second chance. This is Peter Pettigrew's. He may not deserve it but he certainly wasn't happy with how things ended up. The only question was how to get a better future without having to possess the kind of bravery that the lack of had sent him running to Voldemort in the first place...

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**
