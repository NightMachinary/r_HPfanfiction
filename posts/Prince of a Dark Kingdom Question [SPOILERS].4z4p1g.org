I'm at chapter 48, and there seems to be a implied future pairing of Ron/Hermione. I'd love to know if this ends up true or if not before I continue on with the story.

Normally I'm not too picky on side character pairings and I dislike Ron bashing, but the Ron character of the story irks me and I'd rather not continue reading if Hermione ends up in a couple with him.


** Just finished it for the 6th time last week so I can answer your question. No they do not get together. There are a few instances later in the story where that's where it seems to be going but things happen, plus Hermione is just too pragmatic. I too dislike Ron Bashing as it just seems like poor writing, but the Ron in this story is fairly well written while still being an ass.

Any other questions please feel free to ask.

** PotDK is sadly abandoned, but there was never any defined Ron/Hermione romance.
