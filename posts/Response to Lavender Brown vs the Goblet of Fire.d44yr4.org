So I have started a fanfiction in response to this prompt:

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/99s775/discussion_lavender_brown_vs_the_goblet_of_fire/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share]]

It's a little different. It'll be LavenderxRon instead of LavenderxHarry. Mostly because I'm a sucker for the conflict it creates with Hermione.
