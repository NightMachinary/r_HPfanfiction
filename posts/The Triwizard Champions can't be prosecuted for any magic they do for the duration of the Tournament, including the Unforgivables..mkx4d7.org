"Well, well, well... this does look like fun." said Rita Skeeter as she walked in on one of Hagrid's Blast-Ended Skrewts lessons. "Ah, you're here, Harry! So you like Care of Magical Creatures, do you? One of your favourite lessons?"

Harry sighed. He could already tell she was here to either drag him or Hagrid in the mud. He didn't want to deal with it, so he withdrew his wand, pointed it at the reporter and said "Avada Kedavra!"

A jet of bright, green light shot out of his wand and hit Rita in the chest. She fell on the ground, lifeless.

"Harry!" shrieked Hermione.

"What?" he said. "She was annoying!" Harry looked back at Rita and was surprised at the sight he met. "Well, would you look at that, turns out the Skrewts love human flesh!"


** But I could fully see the Ministry seeking to prosecute them (Harry) the instant the Tournament is over, arguing that the Champions were only exempt from prosecution while the Tournament was going on.

*** Sounds like the kind of semantics that would get them laughed out of Court. Though, my guess would be that the Champions can only use illegal magic during the actual challenges, not during the entire timeframe of the Tournament. So, yeah, Harry would have a cozy stay at Azkaban for doing something like in the prompt.

​

(As an aside, it always made sense to me that they would be allowed to use any magic they know, even if it would be illegal any other day of the week, and Harry just cruising through the tasks with no problems just by using the Killing Curse is hilarious beyond belief)

You say that like the Ministry cares about fair and legal jurisprudence. Remember, we saw the Minister throw a man in torture-prison without charge or trial just "to be seen doing something".

** There have been a few fics that did this. One of them was one of the only indy!Harrys I ever read that was worth a damn, mostly because once Harry realized he could do whatever he wanted he decided to complete the Tasks by deliberately flaunting international wizarding law and using muggle technology. He killed his dragon with a rocket propelled grenade launcher, and used a scuba suit with a harpoon gun to complete the second task. Outside of the tasks, he tended to just resort to overwhelming violence whenever he was harassed by people like Malfoy, because he could get away with it and because he felt they had it coming. IIRC, it was mentioned that most purebloods have themselves obliviated after experiencing any sort of trauma, which means all the times Malfoy has been seriously injured by his own attitude and stupidity, he was obliviated of the fact that it happened. So when Harry found out about it, he took it upon himself to "teach them a lesson they can't just make themselves forget about." There were also a lot of references made to Godric Gryffindor, with the heavy implication that Harry was behaving more or less exactly like Godric used to: doing whatever he felt was right and beating anyone who disagreed with him into traction with magic and his fists. It was also a Harmony fic.

There was another that also used this premise, though unlike the previous one, it was actually finished. In effect, the Champions are granted blanket legal immunity via international wizarding law. Plus, the Unforgivables all explicitly state that they cannot be used "on humans." With those two caveats, Harry is inspired by Fake!Moody's lesson to use the Unforgivables to solve the tournament, especially since both Hermione and Ron refused to believe him about entering his name, and because after finding out it was going to be a dragon for the first task, Harry genuinely feared for his life. His usage of the Unforgivables immediately alienates the entire school, all of his friends, and everyone in the wizarding community. However, he blows through the tasks with minimal effort, killing the dragon with a single AK and imperiusing the giant squid to rescue his hostage for him. None of this is illegal, because dragons and squid are creatures, not humans, and even the casual usage of the Unforgivables is covered by the legal immunities the champions enjoy. The fic is a one-shot, and ends with him ending up in the graveyard, only for him to absolutely flatten Voldemort and capture Wormtail, because he was willing to freely use the Unforgivables. The story ends with him coming back, with Voldemort and Peter in tow, and then killing Voldemort a second time, publicly, after revealing the plot behind the Triwizard. He immediately becomes massively famous again, but he ignores it to drop out of school and live quietly alone, because he has become disenchanted with everyone and no longer wishes to deal with them.

**** So, one of those is absolutely correct. Unforgivable Tournament. The other is not, though I appreciate the attempt. The first one I talked about was a hard Harry-Hermione story, with Harry using the Sword of Gryffindor and his bare fists to simply punch his way out of all the people harassing him and giving him and Hermione a hard time during 4th year. I'm 'pretty' sure it also featured Harry using muggle means to circumvent the tasks, but I'm not entirely certain. The defining features of it were the HHr, Harry's willingness to commit physical violence, and also a strong antagonistic relationship with Krum, who kept coming onto Hermione and threatening Harry because he was in a relationship with Hermione.

In essence, Harry was totally fed up with the school and magical society in general, and decided to solve all of his problems with ultraviolence, because screw these people. McGonagall approved, partially because she felt this was the appropriate Scottish response to these issues and partially because apparently this was how Godric solved all of HIS problems back in the day. Again, there were a lot of direct parallels drawn between Harry and Godric, but not in a flattering "he's so heroic" sort of way, but rather "uh oh the guy with the magic sword has that crazy look in his eyes again."

That story also remains perpetually incomplete, because IIRC, it stalled out somewhere between the second and third task.

****** That is definitely it, 10/10. I had been trying to re-find that one for quite some time.

Also, if you've never finished it through, you absolutely should. If nothing else, you have to read to at least chapter 18, though obviously if you go that far you might as well finish it.

I did apparently get some details mixed up, though. McGonagall did NOT approve, Krum was less antagonistic than I remembered, and Harry never used the sword. Though honestly, after all the stuff I've read, I've probably just blended this together with another Triwizard story where Krum was more of a bastard, Harry did use the sword, and McGonagall was a bit more helpful. Not sure what fic THAT was, and I wouldn't expect you to figure it out, either. Those are sparse details to go on. I probably confused them because of the similarities. It's not like there's a drought of 4th year AUs where Harry and Hermione get together and tell the world to suck it.

Maybe I should start compiling a list of good fics where Harry does use the sword, though. Know any good ones?
