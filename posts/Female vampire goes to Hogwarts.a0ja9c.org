I'm looking for fics where a Female protagonist is a vampire, and goes to Hogwarts (or any other magical school). I'd prefer the vampirism being a secret, and the book exploring the issues/perks of being a vampire that knows magic and goes to school.

Only 150k words and above and not abandoned. The more adult themes the merrier, so gore, death, sex, etc is welcome.

Sorry for formatting, on mobile!

Just kidding, but technically it has most of the things on your list...
