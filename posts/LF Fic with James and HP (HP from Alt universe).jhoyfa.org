:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm trying to find a fic that I saved at some point, but cant find on my FF profile since now it is limited to showing only 500.

Anyway, I recall that it was HP that killed himself via AK and ended in an alternate universe where Neville is the BWL. Description said something like James stared/studied? Harry who was and was not his son. Or something like that.

Fic also had him trying to talk to Harry, who was jaded, sarcastic, etc., who didn't approach anyone, etc. It was all one shot.

Any help would be appreciated

  Vague spoilers for PS-HBP. One-shot. James Potter observes as Harry arrives to an alternate dimension where his parents are alive and Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived. Trying to teach old cliches new tricks, here.
