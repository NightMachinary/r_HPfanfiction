I've been rereading [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/285498][Dirgewithoutmusic's AU one-shots]], and it's made me want to read something else that's different.

The only real requirements I have are that it's well written and either currently updating, complete, or with a substantial amount written if it's dead. I generally prefer plot-focus rather than romance-focus, but honestly I'll at least try reading most anything.

^{I'll also take a Hermione as the Chosen One fic, since I apparently only read Hermione-centric AUs...}

Complete, intricate plot, hilarious.

** Linkffn(3239928)

Only linking the first fic of the whole series by HiBob. Generally quite enjoyed orphan Draco's personality and arc throughout the series. Not perfect, but it's a complete series that's well thought out and is a good read for what you're looking for.

** Ginny is the Chosen One in this trilogy that ended up just being 2 parts. The first two parts are long and amazing though. Very well written although they are heavily AU if you mind that.
