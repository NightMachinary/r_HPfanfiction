Im looking for a good fic where harry doesn't feel emotions because of the war or is just affected by PTSD and perferbly goes back in time .


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2859327/1/The-Song-of-the-Trees]], it's not because of PTSD nor because of the war. The mystery, in fact, revolves around why Harry is struggling to feel.

** linkffn(The end was only the beginning by MK-ONE). Molly erupts at Harry after the final battle, and he disappears. When he returns, he's an emotionless "Knight of the Confederation." I only got a few chapters into this, because it didn't appeal to me.

  Takes place after the final victory over Voldemort.A moment of greif fueled rage is misplaced and lives are changed.Harry seeks out a new life abroad; one of duty and honor, though the life he left behind is still calling him home as events conspire against him. Eventually,he finds his heart.Some similarities between this and others of my stories,though this one stands on its own.
