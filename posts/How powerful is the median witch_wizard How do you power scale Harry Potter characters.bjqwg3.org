There does seem to be a magical hierarchy with squibs and muggles having no power, magical creatures having some discrete and specifics powers, with wizards having more generalized powers. Obviously there are gaps in training but there also some internal and innate differences between wizards as well, with natural prodigies such as Voldemort, Dumbledore, and to an extent, Harry, with near-squibs who need to take Kwikspell courses to perform basic magic on the other extreme. What can the average magic user do and how does that compare to the capabilities of the outliers?


** They have a lots of specialists:

- Madam Malkins knows how to make good clothes
- Tom the Bartender and Madam Rosmerta most likely cook well and mix good drinks
- The people at Quidditch Supply enchant brooms
- Mr Ollivander makes great wands
- Lockhart is a memory charm expert
- But according to the Twins, most of Ministry workers couldn't put a decent shield charm. So I think the greatest majority of British wizards suck at combat spells.

*** And honestly, why would they need them? How often does Average Joe get into anything more than a drunken brawl? Even though there was a war, I still think most people wouldn't master combat spells because a) who expects to get in an actual battle, and b) the enemy's just going to use unforgivables anyway and there's not much one can do against them. Most of the wizarding community is going to be non-combatant generalists or specialists at a specific craft, like you said.

**** The fact that DADA is a core, required class indicates it's needed quite a bit actually. However, Voldemort cursed the position around 1965. It's been at least 25 years since there's been a stable curriculum taught. The average skill level is going to drop hard.

***** For a fic I was writing I researched the NEWT DADA class and it was very small, if I recall correctly. So perhaps a lot of people don't actually continue taking it past the required OWL classes?

****** Cursed position means that the teacher change each years. A new professor is already an hassle in itself, but after a few years when most of them are barely competent or totally useless?\\
I'm guessing that the only people taking NEWT Defense are the ones who possed their OWL (which would not be much in itself), and that are seeking employment somewhere where the NEWT is asked, like Auror.\\
Even the one who have just an interest in the subject will probably prefer to study it on their own if it's not vitale to their studies.

***** There are plenty of required classes in real life that most people never actually benefit from. I doubt the average wizard uses Astronomy, for example, and it's a required class as well.

Potentially, one time is enough. Despite, a drunken back with wands might well be quite lethal.

Not much is better than nothing at all.

I imagine there would at least be a sizeable minority of wizards able to defend themselves, even in the general population.

** I generally picture the median wizard as being comfortable with "household magic" which they use in day to day life, plus having a high level ability with a single spell (or set of closely related spells) which reflect their career choice. Pretty much everything else from Hogwarts would be forgotten (if they even successfully mastered it in the first place).

** I don't really think that wizards have any sort of "power level" or the equivalent. Rather, the "power" of any given witch or wizard is dependent on a mixture of innate talent and hard work. It's much like being a good student or being gifted at a particular art-form or a sport. Most of it is hard work and dedication - which is why almost every wizard is theoretically capable of nearly all magics, but there will always be some who just seem to have a knack for some areas, like Harry and flying, which gives them a head-start.

The really powerful wizards, like Voldemort and Dumbledore, are those who were lucky enough be simply have a knack for a lots of types of magic, and much more importantly, had the willpower to work hard to develop their talents.

Most wizards are probably like people in the real world, if they're born gifted in an area, they tend to get lazy about it and never reach their full potential. Like the smart kid in high school who could coast by on little to no work but as a result never developed study habits and therefore never amounted to much.

The powerful wizards are the rare smart kids who also actually worked hard.

** A little hard to say. Most of the characters we have significant info on are either students, teachers or Aurors/Death Eaters.

Arthur and Molly are probably the most average characters we spend extended time with. Arthur's a bureaucrat and Molly's a housewife.

** Most are just powerful enough to get by in their day to day lives and do their job. The more "powerful" (as in skilled) ones are the ones who choose professions that require additional knowledge/training. I imagine wizards as essentially being like us, but with magic, and what I mean by this is that most people stop learning or bothering to acquire additional skills outside of what their jobs demand, even if that knowledge or those skills would help them a lot.

** In a non-war situation nobody except aurors and criminals needs combat skills. The "don't be there and let the aurors handle it" strategy of Umbridge actually makes somewhat sense if you honestly don't believe Voldemort is back. That's why 90% of the population can't get a proper shield charm up and don't resist the Voldemort regime. Only students who still remember DADA lessons and aurors, Order members or Death Eaters who frequently train are decent at combat.

** In my opinion, a perfectly average fully-educated modern wizard /should/ be basically a demigod. It very much irks me in fics where writers seem to think the “average” wizard can barely conjure a tea cosy. People throw around “NEWT-level spell” a lot like that represents an extremely difficult spell, but really that's like saying “The shit they teach you in Year 11 and 12.”

*** Cho Chang couldn't perform a Stunning Spell or the Disarming Charm before Harry showed her how in the DA. This was during her 6th year. After she had passed her Defense O.W.L. with a high enough grade to get to N.E.W.T. Level classes. Granted instruction in DADA was particularly shitty but that is not a good sign.

It is also possible that Cho didn't pass her O.W.L. and might not have been a particularly good student who just wanted to learn more about Cedrics death and better her defense skills anyway, but she's never presented as abnormally weak or talentless, and she was probably studious as a Ravenclaw so that doesn't seem likely.

We know a spectrum exists with near-Squibs who take Kwikspell courses to learn basic magic as adults at the bottom, and demi-gods capable of mind bending feats like Dumbledore and Voldemort, and that the top tier outstrips the median substantially. Where the median lies between the extremes is hard to say.

All we know for certain is that the average adult wizard cannot cast a Corporal Patronus and might not be able to cast any type, that Mind Reading Powers are fleetingly rare, and Animagi are fleetingly rare. Beyond that it's anyone's game.
