With the Current muggle understand of ageing would it really be that hard for a Wizard or witch to make a healing potion or spell that repairs the accumulation of damage in cells that causes ageing?

Sure the Elixir of life is impressive being able to grant Eternal youth in one Potion but couldn't a wizard just create multiple Potions to achieve the same thing?


** Well... you kind of answered your own question: they already did it, with the Elixir of Life, which is insanely hard to prepare, but quite possible.

Otherwise, though, magic takes care of most outward signs of aging, but only on a physical level: they haven't a clue about how to heal cells, outside of the Elixir of Life. I find this actually fits canon data pretty well: Flamel aside, the maximum life expectancy of wizards seems to be in the 300's, which is just about what humans with no health issues but telomeres still wearing down might expect.

*** I've often wondered if Human Transfiguration would offer the answer. Since transfiguration let's you change the actual properties of the object in question, instead of just the outward appearance, I wonder if one could simply de-age oneself by that means. But given Dumbledore didn't do it, I'd assume it can't be done, or if it can wizard's don't know enough about aging to know what to transfigure.

**** Yes, I think most body-altering magic physically shifts cells around or multiplies them, but doesn't do anything about the DNA and telomeres.

*** The thing about the Elixir of life is that as you point out is a potion that as far as we know has only been made by the Flamels.

What I am asking is could Snape or Slughorn take what we currently know about ageing and create something to give themselves eternal youth

Like could a potions master with the knowledge about that we currently have about Telomeres create a potion to repair them. Makeing a potion that they have to take every 290 years to completely repair there telomeres.

** There's this story called [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original.5465/][/The Erogamer/]] (NSFW) on Questionable Questing that, through a very complicated series of events, had its protagonist gather a bunch of biologists come together to try to invent a hypothetical "magical weight loss" treatment, which, among other things in order to keep you from dying horribly, had to (and I quote):

#+begin_quote
  Crank up DNA repair.

  Crank up the immune system, which is apparently also responsible for generally repairing a bunch of stuff in the body, and not just fighting off viruses and bacteria like they teach in high school.

  Crank up the anti-cancer activity of the immune system because the immune system totally does that too.

  Throw in some experimental hacks to dial down autoimmunity and allergy issues so the cranked-up immune system doesn't just kill you.

  Assume all of this has in fact solved cancer, and junk the telomere limits on cell division.

  Try to send out signals to tell the body it's okay for cells to be dividing faster now, in places where cells are supposed to do that at all.

  Stimulate an initial surge of muscle growth, which means the subject should drink at least ten protein shakes per day for the first week.

  Make muscle growth respond faster to exercise in the future.

  Stimulate extremely fast initial growth and sloughing of the dermis in order to get rid of wrinkles and tighten up the skin over where fat used to be---basically once you're out of the ice bath you'll also be tearing off a thick layer of dead skin everywhere and coming out from underneath it with fresh clear skin, like a molting snake.

  Add an experimental antibiotic into the other antibiotics that skin grows naturally, in order to get rid of acne and possibly make people less smelly in various places.

  Do a bunch of stuff you didn't understand about mitochondria and little garbage collecting thingies.

  Increase the levels of a bunch of hormones that usually get dialed down with age.

Now, in the context of Harry Potter, magic helps you get away with a lot of things. Polyjuice should, if we were being realistic, melt you into a blob of ultra-cancerous gore. We also know that Elixir of Life is stupidly hard to make since it at least magics itself past all those finicky problems. If we wanted instead to have magic augment the mundane way our bodies fix themselves in order to grant scientifically sound biological immortality, then our hypothetical potion would need to do /at least/ all of the above.

And not even muggles know how to do most of that. What hope do wizards have?

*** considering that wizards have a potion that gives the drinker good luck, as long as they know what they are trying to do I would say the wizards would have a pretty good chance at doing it.

That's the catch. The problem is that there are things we don't know that we don't know. If we don't know there's a step 12, you'll jump straight from 11 to 13 and melt someone's flesh off...

Yes, because muggles have a fundamentally flawed/lacking understanding of reality.

**** Still no. No amount of muggle science is going to be of assistance when it comes to the magical aspects of age, and that's where the trick lies. Or else Fred and George would have successfulfy put their names in the Goblet of Fire.

***** I think the age line tested more than their physical age.

I would speculate that tested either there metal age or the age of there soul or the line could have even been set to only allow people with who were born before a certain date. Or even all three.
