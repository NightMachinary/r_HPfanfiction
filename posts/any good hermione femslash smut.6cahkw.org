could people recomend some good hermione femslash smut, preferred pairings are either hermione and ginny or hermione and luna, but i'm not that fussy.


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10099028/1/][Murder Most Horrid]], linkffn(10099028): No Voldemort AU. Hermione got together with Bellatrix. Lots of smut and very decent plot.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7525570/1/][Here and There]], linkffn(7525570): This is what time turner travel should be. The plot is compelling, Hermione and Ginny's relationship developed quite nicely, and the fallout of their relationship was well written. Only the ending felt a little off.

  The Battle of Hogwarts reaches a critical point. With few options and even less people left to defeat Voldemort, the side of good's fate may rest on the shoulders and in the hands of two witches. A journey through many kinds of barriers. Eventual HG/GW

  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.

** +There's a fem!Harry/Hermione series by Philosophize or something like that. It's pretty decent. The pro-women stuff gets a bit too much for me later on, and I say that as a woman.+

+The Blackest of Souls is another one. It's Hermione/OC. The OC was a fourth member of the group named Carina. She gets sent to Azkaban even though she's innocent, and when she comes back, she slowly rebuilds her relationship with Hermione+

Edit: Whoops you said smut. My fault.
