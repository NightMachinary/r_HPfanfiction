#+TITLE: It all started when Harry found the picture of Dumbledore and Pablo Escobar. Then another picture with Jimmy Hoffa. Then another picture. Then a journal. The conspiracy that followed could potentially rock the world... and nobody would ever believe him. A 138 years was a long time after all.

** Um... what's the conspiracy? Did Dumbledore kill them, were they his lovers? What'S the conspiracy? Also, I don't know if this is supposed to be part of an AU where Dumbledore doesn't die until at least 2019, but Dumbledore canonically died at the age of 115/116, not 138.
