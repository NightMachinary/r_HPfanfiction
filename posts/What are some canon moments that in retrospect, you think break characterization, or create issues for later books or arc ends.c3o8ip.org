This is inspired partly by the discussion of Hermione setting birds on Ron in the unpopular opinions thread.

In retrospect I can't think of Hermione doing anything like that before or since, and while in context it may not be that serious or humorous (given the level of regular 'pranks', wizards' enhanced durability, lack of clarity as to how serious or damaging the 'attack' was), nonetheless we later have Ron marrying someone who's essentially physically abused him in the past - red flag.

Because I don't feel it was set up that that would be something Hermione would be likely to do, and because Hermione is portrayed as a positive character otherwise, my conclusion is that this is out of character or extreme behavior that creates an issue later on if we are to believe that afterwards Ron and Hermione definitely never had a similar issue again.

What are some others? These could be good jumping off points for AUs.

E: fwiw this was just an example, not the driving force of the thread to debate whether or not this particular incident was OOC.

E2: considering deleting and resubmitting this post given every reply so far has been about whether the example is or is not OOC rather than discussing canon in general.


** I don't think this event is particulary OOC. I mean we know Hermione can have a mean streak (you just need to see how she dealt with Skeeter ), and that she can loose all restraint if pushed hard enough (like how she punched Malfoy ). So I think the "assault " was just there to show how heartbroken she was. That being said, I think there are several time in the books where someone is OOC for plot reason. The main one being DH where most of the characters are holding the idiot ball so the story doesnt end mid September. Also CoS where not even the "brillant " Dumbledore though the Monster of Slytherin was a giant Killing snake. Guess the wizarding world is so dangerous there are a lot of monsters that can kill without leaving any traces.

*** Ugh, and the idiot ball in HBP. Sure, Draco's been a prick literally the entire time we've known him, including thinking he was the heir of slytherin, and we literally just fought his dad on the orders of Voldemort, but him being a death eater is just too far-fetched. Better focus on awkward teenage romances instead of the fact that our mortal enemy is now public and active.

** Hermione not believing Harry over Draco Malfoy is a far bigger OOC moment than the bird attack, which is actually fairly in line with her characterizations from the previous 5 Books:

- Setting a teacher on fire
- Hexing Neville who got in their way
- Stealing from a teacher, brewing illegal potion, knocking out and abducting two students, impersonating them, and interrogating another
- Letting her cat loose on her friend's pet rat
- Punching Draco Malfoy
- Imprisoning a reporter in a jar and blackmailing her later
- Organizing an illegal armed student group
- Cursing the signup sheet without telling those involved

This is a quite vicious girl, totally dark lord material if there are more catalysts. I actually think JKR nerfed Hermione's ability and viciousness a lot in the last two Books to jam her (pathetic) wizard Jesus plot through.

** She kidnapped and blackmailed Rita Skeeter... not sure if attacking Ron with birds is the worst thing she's ever done.

*** Sure, but that was something she covered her back on. I'm not saying Hermione doesn't have dark or amoral elements to her, but she's also careful to not let anything stick on her. Essentially an assault that everyone knew was her, on school grounds where she could be punished, seems comparatively OOC.

**** Hmm but in your post you said such an extreme act was ooc, now you say it's doing something that can be traced back to her. The attack was a spur of the moment thing in an emotional situation, I don't really think it's that out of character.
