Cloud the Fidelius be used to hide anything or does it have to be a location? Also could the Secret Keeper be Obliviate.

Exemple: Harry's real name is Alexandria Samantha Bones. Could Dumbledore put a Fidelius on Harry real name and sex and made baby Harry the SK then Obliviate him


** Canon fidelis is only seen protecting locations, is known to be complicated, and the secret keeper must /willingly/ give up the secret, so no mind magics such as leligemency or obliviate work. If the SK dies it passes on to all who have the secret. The wiki claims that if the SK dies without anyone else knowing, it's lost forever.

Personally I think the fidelis' uses need to be massively expanded, or limitations imposed. It's known that the SK can be under fidelis (Arthur-Burrow, Bill-Shell), however James & Lily choose someone else. Why doesn't Voldemort make finding his horcruxes impossible by making himself or a dead person SK. Play with it how you like in fanon.

*** I think the reason why Voldemort did not cast a fidelius on the cave that holded his horcrux is because he can't cast a fidelius. It is cannon that dark wizards and witches cannot cast a Patronus because of their idea of happines is twisted and my hypothesis is that fidelius requires you to show complete trust to someone. The word fidelius comes from latin word "fidem" which means belief or trust. We can easily say that Voldemort did not trust anybody.

** In the story Harry Potter and The Power of Paranoia by arekay Harry uses a random muggle to be the secret keeper for Harry's house and has him write a few slips of paper with the secret on it. Then he obliviates the muggle.

  The events at the end of the Triwizard Tournament have left Harry feeling just a little bit paranoid.

** My takeaways are:

The secret keeper cannot be part of the secret. If they could, either Lily or James could have been the secret keeper in canon and they would have been untouchable.

The secret either cannot be Obliviated, or Obliviating it causes the Fidelius to collapse as the secret keeper no longer has the secret.

The Fidelius could potentially work with any kind of secret, but we don't see this happen in canon. If it was possible, I think it would be a much more common spell due to how versatile it would be.

** It was described as hiding a secret in someone's soul. I don't know whether an obliviate would work, but as Rowling didn't really go into more than the basic mechanics of her world's magic, if you worked it out then it could work.

I do personally think you could use fidelius to hide that kind of secret, but I know different people have different ideas about it

** I was thinking about Alexandria (fem Harry) being the daughter of Severus and Amelia, but Dumbledore kidnap her and made her into Harry. Then Dumbledore put the info under the Fidelius and making Harry the SK
