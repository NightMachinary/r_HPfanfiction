I am tired of all the bashing or dumbledore being a manipulative bastard or even on the other hand where he is super helpful and competent

I enjoyed reading the stories by kathryn518 and JacobApples where dumbledore is simply trying his best and was wondering if there were more like it

no slash (unless canon) no fem!harry no hinny no harmony


** For Flowerpot fics, there's Ingenio ab Artifex, A Veela Cries, and His Angel. The latter doesn't focus on it, but there's a really nice conversation about two-thirds of the way through ish that I really quite liked. The second has a conversation that expresses those sentiments quite close to the beginning.

I'm sure there's more for other pairings, I'm just on a Harry-Fleur kick at the mo'.

** Maybe Obscura Nox Animae by Heatherlly? It's about Lily and Snape. Snape asked Voldemort to spare Lily so Voldemort uses the chance to try a spell he came across leading to Lily's soul surviving (kind of Horcrux style) while her body dies. Her soul attaches to a living being (a mouse) and she witnesses what's going on in Harry's life and also gets to spy on Dumbledore. She later gets her body back (thanks to Snape) and is at odds with Dumbledore because of all the stuff he more or less let happen to Harry but she also sees that it's necessary...

I think most well written stories don't bash anyone? Don't want to insult anyone, but I don't think bashing is a sign of good writing. You should really be a bit more specific about what stories you like to read. The Dumbledore in my story (A Slytherin Through Time on FFN) is kind of what you are looking for, but he's more or less a side character so it's probably not what you're looking for.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.
