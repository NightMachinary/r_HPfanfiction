I just finished reading it for the first time and holy shit I loved it! To me. It's up there with Sun Source and Core Threads. But it ends on cliffhanger and I want to know what happened with everyone!! Anyone know if there are any updates past chapter 49?


** I've read both of those stories, but never read Gods Amongst Men. Does he really get that powerful to be mentioned along side Core Threads(where he has Death as a literal aspect of his mind), and Sun Source(which has him be able to do frankly impossible things WITHOUT magic)? If so, could you maybe give me a hibt of the power he wields.

*** I guess Core Threads might not be the best to compare to because he doesn't get near god level like he does in Core Threads. He's closer in terms of raw power (possibly exceeds) to Sun Source. This is a spoiler but not a huge one: he takes on both Dumbledore and Voldemort at the same time, and doesn't die. So it's like that, maybe heading more Merlin level. Still a pretty great ffn in my opinion.

** I just read the first few chapters, and I have to ask. Why do you like this so much? It is so tropy, and cliche that it hurts to read. It has the goblins don't get remembered trope, it has the goblins falling all over themselves when treated with respect trope, it has Harry who is basically a strong male fanon Hermione in spirit, it has getting rid of the Horcrux makes him super Harry trope, it has Harry making millions from the Basilisk trope, it has Fleur, and Gabrielle needing saving/being damsels in distress being saved by Harry, and others that I have no reason to list since you get the point. Why, why do you like this crap?

Core threads is very unique in a lot of ways, which is why we can ignore a lot of the tropes. The same goes for Sun Source. Gods Amongst Men has no such redeeming quality. It is a story i've read many times when I was new to HP fanfics, and was an angsty little shit. While I can see myself maybe being in the mood for such stories from time to time, it's very rare these days. If I look for a godlike Harry these days, I want it to be interesting. Like maybe a crossover done right, or a unique magic system. Maybe the strangley rare scientist Harry, as in an actual scientist, not just a smart, because the author says.

With all these options, why do you read that fic in particular? Why not ITMOAS. A little tropy, but very unique, and a story i've read many times including the sequels. How about Seventh Horcrux. Again tropy, but something that this community in general agrees is hilarious. Both also feature a OP Harry. There are many more, but you get the point.

*** Well mostly because I'm still fairly new to fanfiction so I still haven't gotten the tropey stories out of my system. Most stories that are not OP Harry just bore the shit out of me, because otherwise (purely in my opinion) they're the same as any other magic fiction I've read, which then makes if feel pointless to me. I do cringe at many moments throughout a lot of these stories though, especially parts where angsty teen Harry tells off someone in a way where they just sound like a teenager.

I can't find ITMOAS, what does that stand for? For an original, OP Harry with a crossover, I recommend checking out The Other Krptonian. Here it's done well and the crossover is awesome.

**** In the mind of a scientist. Harry is a genius in science to the point that by the time he fights Voldemort, it's so easy that he only draws his wand once. He uses his knowledge to improve himself physically by a huge degree(think spider-man levels), and is just massively intelligent. It's sequels are crossovers with Stargate, and then Mass Effect. It's just incredible how powerful he gets by that point(enough to hurt Anubis who is partially Ascended, and was able to destroy four Hataks at once, and steal the last one. He did that on his own). If you want OP Harry, and an enjoyable story, this is my suggestion.

Mage Of Krypton is my go to Superman Harry stories. I think it's at the fifth, or sixth book at this point, and Harry is Superman, but that doesn't automatically mean he wins every fight. It's grounded more than you'd think without downplaying the pure physical might of Harry.

***** Wow, okay so I just went and read In the mind of a scientist and damn that's a great fan fiction. I'm almost done with Madness at the gate already haha. Good call, though one of my only complaints is the low amount of magic. Obviously Madness at the gate would have less but even Mind of a scientist it was mostly potions, science and some magic. That was one of the things I loved about the stories I mentioned, is the high amount of magic described. I havent read Mage of Krypton, I'll check it out! Like my previous sentence mentioned, does it have a lot of Harry using magic or mostly other powrda with a little magic? I'm sure ill read it either way, just curious.

****** Well, in Mage Of Krypton he learns some wandless Kryptonian magic that runs a different system to HP magic. While not as flexible as HP magic in my opinion, it is unique in it's use. I won't say anymore, but apart from me not liking him having no resistance to magic(while everyone supposedly has some, but the author decided that for some reason a Superman that can use magic is more vulnerable to it than even the average Superman. What?!?).

I did enjoy the story for a good bit. I might go back to it one day if I can ever get over such a stupid, and obvious plot weakness. Meaning that it was placed there just to give him a stronger weakness to magic. Which I think is both stupid, and makes no sense since his vulnerability comes from him not being able to use it in comics.

Getting back to the question(sorry for the rant), yes the story does delve into magic quite a bit, and even different magic systems. He is quite powerful in this story, but I left right as Voldemort, and ??? started collecting ??? in ??? which I believe the author purposefully did to exploit Harry's weakness-which-makes-no-sense to magic.
