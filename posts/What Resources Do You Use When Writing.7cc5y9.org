Not sure if this is the right flair or not, but I recently began my first and assuredly horrible attempt at writing my own fic and I am looking for resources to help develop my world properly. The specific one that made me think of asking for help is that I have no idea what common British slang was in the 90's beyond what is written in the original books. Is there any good sources you use to help maintain your setting both in time and in location, especially for American writers?


** I will sometimes search the web for a phrase and add British slang to see what comes up. I have a small reference book of British slang and a couple of British friends I use as resources. You can probably also just google "British slang"--I've found a few good pages that way.

Watch a lot of U.K. TV shows too. Netflix has a lot, some of which are of the 90s era. A show like Skins featuring teenagers would be a great place to start.

British slang can be odd. For example, in the US, we'll say someone attractive is "cute", but in the U.K., an attractive person is called "fit", whether they're in good shape or not.

** Wikipedia, and the HP fan wiki, mostly.

** I prefer to watching Top 10 shows that show extreme environments, then check with shows that provide step by step shows of different occupations. Sometimes I look at Bob Ross paintings or google nebulas to get an idea of atmospheric setting.

I find that constant exposure to the closest idea usually sparks.
