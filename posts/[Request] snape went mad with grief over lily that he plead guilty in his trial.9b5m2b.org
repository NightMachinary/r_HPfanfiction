Any story with this prompt?


** I don't think he /had/ a trial to plead guilty at.

As odd as it sounds, it seems like Dumbledore just sort of said "this is why he's on our side and we shouldn't jail him." And they just shrugged and rolled with it because he's Albus Dumbledore, and they all sort of know he could literally conquer the Ministry with relatively little effort.

**** Yeah, but remember at this time no one but the Dark Lord and Dumbledore know Snape brought Voldemort the prophecy, in the ministrys eyes, he's just another random death eater.

***** Sure but being a Death Eater was enough to be put into Azkaban too. That aside, I really was talking about Dumbledore just waving it off. "Work for me and we're good, mate."

****** Do you have any idea the amount of crimes and violence that have been avoided by ratting out others? That's a textbook aspect of many western legal systems. Not to mention the countless people turned traitor in history because x side gave them what they wanted.

******* Um, who did Snape rat out? That was Kakaroff. And as far as we were shown, Snape's turning traitor didn't seem to amount to anything until a decade later (Dumbledore just put the Potters under Fidelius, I think, we don't get anything about pre-Harry spy work).

******** Good question. It seems like in canon Dumbledore did something similar with the Karkaroff method in that he convinced the Wizengamot Snape was working for them/passing off information (maybe it was like with Emmeline Vance and Snape offered up random Death Eater #27 to make it work).

But then, we don't really know either way. Maybe Dumbledore said a bunch of information came from Snape, or maybe he just said 'trust me he's on our side.' Seems there is a lot of room for what Dumbledore's 'evidence' could have been, as he stated during the trial.

********* Yea but my thing is Voldemort identified Kakaroff as a traitor for giving up names, but he didn't think Snape was. At least from Dumbledore's words, it was just Snape switching sides near the end that got him off.

**** How much does the Wizarding World know about what Snape was up to though? From memory, no one knows his involvement in the prophecy reveal beyond Dumbledore and the Death Eaters.

No no, that doesn't make sense. Dumbledore has no power at all to do anything like that. According to fanon Dumbledore is the most powerless man to ever hold the positions he has. That's why he couldn't get Sirius a trial or anything and Sirius had to be locked up in an old house for a year.

**** That depends on what part of 'fanon' you look at. Many fics roll with the idea that Dumbledore could have done something to help Sirius but chose not to for various reasons.
