I've recently been getting into these kinds of fanfics where Harry dies but suddenly wakes up as his younger self. I dont really care if there is a slash or some kind of pairing. I also dont really care when he wakes up as his younger self as long as there arent any crossovers with other fanfics. Thanks!!!

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

*** Is this fanfic any good? Does it have any bashing? Will Harry actually apply himself to his studies rather than taking divination? Will he try to change things or realize that things most go the way they did before after him trying to change things makes them worse?

**** Fun fact - he tells everyone his scar is a Seer to explain away his future knowledge, and convinces Trelawney that him taking Divination would be a waste of time since his scar is the Seer, not Harry himself.

** Well I'm reading linkffn(Back to the Beginning by burnable) at the moment.

It's kind of tropey and a bit too indie Harry for me but it has just enough interesting storylines I haven't read elsewhere to keep me attached for now after 15 chapters.

This is the author who did that really long Harry/Marvel dimension travel fic where he paired with Black Widow if that into means anything to you.

**** I don't have any feelings one way or the other really about harem stories. This isn't really focused on the harem however. It's just kind of a thing that happens. So far it's just the girls are part of a study group and familial unit with Harry and are just kind of there with sparse bits thrown in the middle of the story.

It feels tacked on to be honest.

***** Just finished this myself. It really feels like it could have just been a group of friends , but it went the romance way instead. It felt forced when it happened to me, but it was then pushed into the background for more plot related things and I was ok with that.

I'm not against harem stories, but they need to be thought out- this one felt like a slight â€˜oh yeah side note- we are a harem now- anyway homework?' And it just made me pause and have to just nod and go along with it. Great fic overall though.

  When the most powerful magics collide due to Harry Potter's desperate, last sacrifice, he creates for himself a chance to fix up the wrongs in his world. Yet going back in time isn't everything that he expected: Voldemort is a threat, but it is Harry himself who no longer fits comfortably in the world. Time has changed him, he just hasn't yet figured out how.
