** I forgot what the name of the fic was, but Sirius believed he deserved Azkaban because he did kill those muggles when he fought Peter. That is, during the duel between them, Sirius got so worked up that he stopped caring about collateral damage and used the most powerful spells he had to make sure that Peter died. In the course of the fight, those muggles were killed and Sirius believed Peter dead.

This makes a bit of sense because Sirius broke out of Azkaban the moment he knew Peter was alive. If he thought Peter wasn't dead, he wouldn't have spent 12 years in prison before breaking out - he would have done it sooner. He didn't try and break out sooner because he genuinely felt he was guilty of manslaughter - when he killed those muggles.

*** That's not a bad idea to up drama, but I don't think it's necessary to explain why he spent 12 years in Azkaban when he could have broken out earlier. /Dementors/. Animagus or no they were still affecting him enough that he was severely depressed and didn't really have much of a will to live (and he didn't have much to live /for/, did he? Two of his best friends were dead and he'd just killed the third, who was a traitor. Yes, yes, Remus, I see you in the back, but that doesn't mean Sirius didn't have a lot to mope about regardless). He had no personal desire to live; only when he learned Wormtail was alive, and, what's more, threatenign his godson, did he muster up enough willpower to shake off his lethargy and leave.

You sure about that? One commonly disregarded Slytherin trait is self preservation. Before the last battle, every single one of them decided to leave (I've thought of this as Rowling's bias) - they didn't want to leave their lives to some wonky Deus Ex Machina saving them at the last minute, which is what happened. That is self preservation at its finest.

**** When someone is contemplating or realizing they have the power to perform a deed of incredible bravery - for Dumbledore it was going off to fight Grindlewald one-on-one - a phoenix appears. If the person chooses to go right then and there and do the thing, the phoenix stays, bonds with them and helps as much as it can- upping their chances of survival with phoenix tears and such. If they are too scared to follow through or put it off until later, the phoenix disappears and will never come again, even if they later do the thing.

This isn't well-known and most people don't realize that it's a chance that will never come again, or that the phoenix will try and help them. They only know that one has shown up and is urging them wordlessly to be brave. So whether to reject or accept the challenge is more dependent on their personality, not just not wanting to lose their phoenix. And people who accepted have still died trying to do their task.

It's said that Godric Gryffindor rejected his phoenix, and regretted it all his days. His entire life was trying to make up for it by committing acts of bravery, and his house colors are the phoenix's red and gold.

In the story, Harry was realizing he had the chance to defeat all the dementors in Azkaban thanks to his extra-special patronus (one of the stupidest things in HPMoR, tbh) but when the phoenix shows up he asks it to come back when he's older and has a better chance of success, not realizing it's a one-time thing.

****** You're probably right and I just didn't like it. Aside from the cringe factor of having Harry be the one (which is fine in most fics, it was that HPMoR took itself so /seriously/ in the "this-is-the-right-way-to-live-your-life" way) it bugged me that the dementors represented death, when in canon they are depression. Since the story was represented as a for-want-of-a-nail fic where the things changed were Harry's and Quirrellmort's personalities, that detail also changing made it seem like the author got it wrong and didn't pay attention to canon. I was also not over-thrilled that the perfect representation of a patronus was a human, it just seemed overly arrogant, especially in a universe where there are other sentient beings.

But I concede none of that makes it poorly thought out, only not to my taste.

What the hell gave you that impression? /HPMoR/ is a heavy AU from the get-go, where many spells work differently and a lot of the history was different. Prophecies are always binding, the Interdict of Merlin is a thing, magical exhaustion is a thing, Merlin predated the Founders, "Dark Lord" is a long-standing title, etc., etc., etc. The "What if Petunia married a scientist?" premise is simply an easy doorway into the story, in the sense that if Petunia /had/ married Vernon, something more /like/ the canon books could have taken place, but by no means is it a straight what-if and it was never conceived as one by its author.

Well to be fair, in one of the more questionable decisions of its worldbuilding, it's established early on that all nonhuman sentients in the HPMOR-verse are cursed/Transfigured/mutated offshoots of humans, as opposed to independantly-evolved species.

Is there a reason that this in particular bugged you? I admit, when I first read HPMOR I thought that the 'super patronus' was extremely silly, but that 'dementors are death/despair personified' was a very interesting and well thought out interpretation that would have fit with canon. Of course, they also fit with the moral of the story in HPMOR, but it's a good idea that I would want to use in any fic I would write.

Thus he skimmed through them, watched the movies, and filled the rest of his knowledge-gaps in with the Wiki.

What I'm getting at is that while none of this is /admirable/, it's not for lack of caring that he didn't read the later books; and also, that the fact that he didn't read the later books isn't actually related to any changes he made to the lore, as he was well-informed of the canon info and /chose/ to depart from it.

As a young child your mind and beliefs are shaped by the words of the people around you. During your most formative stage, when you are learning 'right' and 'wrong', you are taught the best way to behave to get what you need (food, comfort, safety). Most kids get drilled with the idea that "you get what you want by being nice and helpfull."

But what if, during that stage, you got advice from a non-human creature whose instincts say "scare or hurt the enemy so it wont hurt you anymore." And then what if that advice turned out to actually work? It's logical that a child who talks to snakes would develop a different sense of morality.

  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.

Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way!

** Just read linkffn(Hermione Granger, Demonologist) for the book club, and it makes a strong case that history books have been revised and the witch hunts were more successful than is currently admitted.

So, you can freeze the flames to stop them burning you? Great, now all the people who came to watch the show will see that you're standing in the middle of the fire without being burnt! They/might/ treat you like King Nebuchadnezzar treated Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, concluding that you're protected by God. But more likely they'll take it as proof of witchcraft.

Hopefully you're also immune to hanging, drowning, beheading, disembowelment, and torture - and even though you were obviously taken by surprise, you still managed to evacuate your family somewhere safe, right?

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete.
