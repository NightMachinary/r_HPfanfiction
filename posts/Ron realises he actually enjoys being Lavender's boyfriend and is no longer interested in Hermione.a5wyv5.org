I've always felt that if JKR hadn't been so determined to force Ron and Hermione together then he and Lavender would have made a very nice couple. I think they're perfect together. So I'm curious if there are any fics that follow this premise.


** I always felt like JK did a mean disservice to girls like Lavander. Ron dates her in a mean mindset and their breakup was horrible of him. It always sucks to be the one more invested in a relationship than the other person, but no one even called him out on the dick move. I wish Lavander got a happy ending, or at least an apology.

** I always thought it was horribly unfair to both girls. At that point in the story Ron and Hermione are both kind of aware how they feel about each other but too awkward to do anything about it. Then Ron gets annoyed when it comes up that he's never had a relationship and lashes out by getting with Lavender and basically flaunts it in Hermione's face. Lavender deserves better than to be used like that and Hermione deserves better than to end up with someone that would deliberately do that to hurt her. I kind of always wished the two of them would go. Wait. Why are we fighting over some stupid boy. And decide that neither of them wanted him anymore and would become friends over it.

***** ... it's so funny to me that so many people bring up the "mellowing out for the better as years go by" when trying to pair Ron or Hermione with other people besides how it actually ended up, but then can't seem to understand how both Ron and Hermione would ALSO mellow out on their more negative personality traits and grow together as well, made even more realistic and strong BECAUSE they actually DO love each other and would want to try to better themselves for each other.

Relationships are hard work, no matter how compatible you were to begin with. Ron and Hermione may not be the most naturally compatible people ever but they both are flawed and they both push each other to grow in ways that no one else seems to be able to break through to either of them. I'm not saying everyone has to love the fact that they end up together by any means. But, fictional characters or not, we do not get to dictate their canonical feelings. Just like in real life, feelings are feelings and almost never make sense and almost never are rational and that is a big part of what makes them so beautiful.

****** When people say things like that, it makes me wonder if they've even had someone close in an abusive relationship. Ron and Hermione were verbal abusive to each other, and that would not "mellow out" over time. Two people who constantly abuse and tear each other down are not going to work regardless of growing up. That's why teen R/HR (and D/HR) would never work. They would need to grow as people away from each other first.

******* I was in a very very abusive relationship (physically and emotionally) for two years myself, so yes to answer your question at least one of us does. I would not equate ron and Hermione with what would happen if draco/Hermione actually were a couple at all. Not in the same category. That relationship idea is it's whole own set of wtf to me. I just do not at all see Ron and Hermione as a toxic relationship. They bicker and fight, sure, most of which comes from being very young and immature and not just admitting their feelings for a long time. Not to mention we actually see very little of an actual romantic relationship between them at all in the books it is really hard to be able to say definitively one way or the other if their relationship could/would end up toxic. I can see how it could possibly end up that way but to me you already see in deathly Hallows in the beginning that Ron is trying very hard to grow and recognize his own faults and his own pigheadedness over the years. But I can also see how someone else might interpret that completely differently or as possible emotional manipulation. It's clear to me that that was never really jkr's intent in writing it though.

Now I'm not taking the films into account at all because the film characters are very very different to me than in the books.

*edit to add still. Of you believe that Ron and Hermione have an emotionally abusive relationship but then think that Ron and lavender have any chance you really just are deluded because ron and lavender were both far more emotionally abusive to each other than Ron and Hermione ever were.

I actually don't think Ron would mind the first half. He's from a large, loud, passionate kind of a family.

The clinginess, OTOH, clearly did bother him, and he talked to Harry about it.

If Lavender had just been willing to back off slightly when not actively engaged in removing Ron's face, then quite possibly their relationship could have gone places. I can easily believe that someone could slightly tweak things to write that story.
