Request #1) A prank, where on the first year letters, everyone is told to practice occulmency, and, as a prank, everyone uses it on the sorting hat. The sorting hat then gives up, and declares them all muggles. The hogwarts staff know they arent muggles, but they cant be put into houses. This happens many years in a row, until they abolish the houses. Request #2) Everyone can control magic from birth, and trick the book to not accept them, for years, till hogwarts goes out of business Request #3) Large scale protest to abolish the Statute of Secrecy.
