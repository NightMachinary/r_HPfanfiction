There have been similar posts, last some 2 years ago I believe. But I do think that if there are no satisfactory answers, it simply means that not enough questions have been asked.

*What I seek, is discussion (as well as some recommendations as appopriate, but I can't do double flairs) of fanfiction where Main Character - or even a cameo - is in love with Magic.*

There are two main types here, that I have seen:

#1: In love with Magic as a person, an anthropomorphic representation akin to Endless of DC fame. (I freely admit to crushing hard on Teleute when I first discovered that comic). These kinds of stories are usually composed mostly of character interactions, and glorious character development. Lots of goodies here. Some I've read had young Harry materialize his magic as a not-so-imaginary friend, with cute results. Fun!

#2: In love with concept of magic. I mean... Not everyone likes Victorian decor and lack of electronics but hey, Magic! How cool is that! Yer a wizard, Reddit! You can do anything! The world's your oyster! Physics have finally released their grip on you, there's no stopping you now!I would like to see recs here where a character does not lost that childlike wonder, that ability to by awed by the unusual. In the books, we see normal people going about their lives, students complaining about studying...Sure, they're witches and wizards, but both the original and most fanworks just render them mundane, in a way. We usually only see Miss Lovegood and Creevey brothers breaking apart from the mold... Or maybe I was just looking in wrong places?

Have you encountered either type of Magic Lovin'? Maybe you have a new one? Maybe you have some ideas on implementation? Agree? Disagree? Snape-rant me? I want to see what you think.

** In canon/films, Harry has his moments, like when he first walks into an expanded tent, or when he first sees Hogwarts or the Burrow.

*** True, but unfortunately it doesn't last. Within days he's back to complaining about homework.

I mentioned Luna earlier: the girl still talks about wrackspurts and nargles, reads Quibbler upside down, and wanders around with her eyes on the ceilings...\\
And as annoying as photo-boy was still a passionate young man filled with wonder - and we didn't see that die until final Voldemort War.

** Awkwardly late, I know. Was gonna respond earlier, but forgot.

I've been looking for something along the lines of your first type for /years/. I've, unfortunately, not found anything decent. You say you've read some, any recommendations?

My favorite fanfiction of /all time/, [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5866937/1/Control][Control by Anonymous58,]] is one which I think /semi/ fits /both/ of your types.

While I wouldn't say this Harry /loves/ his magic, he definitely anthropomorphizes it, (gives it a body in his head) and views it as his /"savior"/--something (or, perhaps, the /only/ thing) which was always there for him. There's a definite /unique/ relationship there, if nothing else.

For your second type, I believe this Harry /semi/ fits because he is, at least, /aware/ of his lack of "awe" toward magic--something /so/ awesome--and seeks to better himself toward the end of the story. Unfortunately, the story was never finished, and updates are unlikely.

"Control" is pretty trope-y in many ways, (this Harry's a dick, but all the ladies love him, very edgy, so on) but I've personally never much cared for such things. (though, I think this Harry's edginess is mostly mitigated by the colorful personalities of various other characters, I think)

  Snape-rant me?

Snape was /hardly/ an "/interesting character/", and an even worse person. Never got the love.

Again, sorry for the super late response.

*** Welcome, welcome! Better late than never!\\
You say you've had a hard time finding the 'anthropomorphic' Magic recs?\\
Well, the first, and most satisfying would be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5934267/1/][Finding Why's]] , which features Magie as Harry's first friend / caring sister. Very nice, very sweet if not exactly romantic - Harry's young.

There are a few more I do not remember, as well as a few that do not fully fit (Fair Lady by kideaxl has Death instead of Magic). Fate's Gamble by Lupine Horror has a wide variety of deities and 'humanized' concepts, but this is a Fate/Cross, so it's expected. Not exactly love, but normal interactions.

**** I'll give those all a glance, thanks. Think I've read "Fair Lady" actually, not sure.

Yeah, I saw your post the day you posted it, wrote the first couple of lines, and then got caught up in other stuff. Totally meant to respond 10 days ago, lol

I've seen a few posts similar to this one over the years (as have you, I believe) and, it's a shame, they always go mostly unnoticed. This is just an unpopular subject, it seems. One of these days I might sit down and write my own. I've certainly got a lot of ideas, just not overly confident in my abilities. Though writing is definitely the way to improve anyhow, so...
