Let's say you want to write a fluffy, yet canon-compliant fic that focuses on the more high-schooly aspects of Hogwarts without touching so much on the series' central plot. A little side adventure for the characters with no lasting consequences. At what point in time would you set the story? I'm thinking the best choice is probably September-October during Harry's fourth year. There isn't even quidditch practice to have to worry about.


** I would say third year. Avoid the Dementors, and your have the whole year to good off, with the exception of Black.

*** You wouldn't have the Marauder's Map until later in the year, and by that point don't you have to deal with the friction between Ron and Hermione due to Crookshanks and Scabbers?

You would still have Percy and Wood, though.

** If you're not using the main characters and just want teen drama then fourth year is best. You have the tasks each being gossip, the champions being prime gossip, potential drama between the students from different schools, and of course the most important event for teen girls, the ball.

If you want to find a window in canon using the main characters then sixth year. Other than stalking Malfoy, not much happened and the Slug-club provides mini dates. The characters are also of an age where they are able to date people with it being completely normal. Sure Harry know Voldemort is out there and Malfoy is up to something but its actually one of the quieter years.

** Any point after finding the room of requirement but before torching the place.

They could find some sort of magic item that gives them an adventure that happens in an instant in real-world time.

** Hmmm, it depends on which characters you're interested in. Harry and friends? Probably Sixth-year. That's the only one where the dynamics of Hogwarts remain relatively unchanged (No monsters inside the castle, no McGuffins like the Stone or Goblet [The Vanishing Cabinet really doesn't compare] no Tournaments)

But really, I think it does boil down to characters

Take Ginny and Luna. I have a soft spot for their platonic friendship. Fics for them can happen pretty much anytime and still remain relatively small in scope.

Case in point, "Fire and Air"
