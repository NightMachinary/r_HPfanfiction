linkffn(Harry potter and the bookwyrm by jelsemium) for those interested in knowing what the favorited story was.

Are they still writing in your favorite--or the fandom that brought them to your attention--fandom or have they gone on to something new?


** There was a Harry Potter fanfiction writer that started writing in 1999 (Cant be bothered to remember their name). I believe he has stopped writing.
