Looking for any (preferably good) Harry/Ginny stories that do not have Ron/Hermione in them. Preferably during Hogwarts years, but I'm open to anything.

Thanks!


** That's actually pretty rare.

*Ginny Returns* by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1251524/kb0][kb0]] and *The Thorny Rose Series* by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4577618/Brennus][Brennus]] are the only two I can think of, despite reading many H/G fics.

If you include Harry/Multi, then there are far more choices, but I doubt that's what you want.

  Harry has been entered into the Triwizard Tournament against his will, and his friends don't believe him when he insists he didn't enter his name. Will Ginny Weasley sit by and watch him suffer alone, or will she risk exposing the dark secret she has been hiding. GoF re-write from Ginny's POV. Smart & slightly manipulative Ginny! Extreme Ron-bashing!

*** I'm don't mind Harry/Multi. Which would you recommend that have Ginny as a member (bonus points for also having Hermione, but I imagine that pretty frequently the case)?

**** Usually those stories come with a heavy dose of Ron bashing, so be prepared:

*The Accidental Bond*, linkffn(5604382), used to be one of my top favorites until I soured on Ron bashing. It's still a nice, light-hearted relationship fic though.

*True Color Show*, linkffn(8893072)

*Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw*, linkffn(11574569), contains lots of tropes I dislike, but it's so well written that it has become my favorite WIP at moment. It's the first time I actually enjoy Daphne Greengrass as the Ice Queen of Slytherin. Harry was extraordinarily powerful, and yet he still faced an uphill battle. The Potters abandoned and mistreated Harry, and yet they were not bad people and their actions believable. Dumbledore was evil, but not stupidly evil as depicted in so many Dumbledore bash fics. All 5 girls are well characterized and interesting in their own ways.

--------------

How could I forget *Lady Archimedes*, linkffn(11463030)? It's H/G and Hermione with George!

***** Lady Archimedes is a sequel to The Arithmancer; linkffn(10070079). So it might be easier to understand. There isn't any major romance, but you do see some future romances being set up.
