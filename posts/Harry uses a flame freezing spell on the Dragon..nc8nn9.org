I am looking for a series of oneshots about alternative ways Harry could have won the Triwizard Tournament Tasks. In one of them Harry used The Summoning Charm to get the egg and used Flame Freezing Spell to survive Dragon's fire. In another He used a spell found in a Library book to split Black Lake in two.


** Honestly my favourite has to be the one where he tries to portkey the dragon as far towards the forest as possible, but as hes a complete newbie, it ends up on top of the slytherin/judges stands. And hes like "well if they expect a single 14 year old to be able to handle a dragon, a booth of judges and a stand of students should take it down without problems right?"

Cue a few hundred dead, because No, a dragon is fucking dangerous.

  Sometimes playing by the rules is not just your best option, it can be your only option.
