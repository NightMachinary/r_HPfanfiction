In my next story, tentatively titled HP& the elder scroll fallout, harry's wands don't work, only the seven spells he's most used can be done wandlessly while he'll learn the magic of the elder scrolls verse fused with the legendary effects on fallout armor/weapons to enchant.

I wanted to really get into enchanting and magitek/technomagery and had a bit of an epiphany when i realized I could have Harry disassemble a weapon then on a whim decide to use Reparo to reassemble it. It works but something changed when he realizes the barrel or blade has been fused with an element that was on the table he used to work, giving the weapon the ability to do something new: perhaps an explosive poison edge to his blade or a cryo grenade launcher is fused to his reassembled lupara. As time goes on, he'll learn how to disassemble the weapons that have legendary effects and maintain their MAura(mechanical/magical aura) to transfer it to another weapon as well as placing various components from different weapons and various bits of magical components to fuse a wholly new class of weaponry such as turning a .44 magnum revolver into a magically charged weapon of mass destruction.

So, anyway, suggestions on making sure harry and his intended(ciri) aren't a curbstomping problem for the elder scroll reviving magic and tech savvy groups like the gunners?

** I'd say: think of them as the player-character and the sidekick. If you think back, as a PC you basically curbstomped your way through the world like crazy. 10+ enemies through and suddenly there is this /thing/ thats kinda immune to your shit and voila, you got a problem on your hand.

So in terms of the fic, Harry and Ciri just fall into a league of danger somewhere around dragons, deathclaws and big bads in powerarmor.

However, since I don't know what Harry can do other than his magitek stuff, I gotta admit I may be off the mark here.

*** At the beginning i want him to struggle. By the midpoint he's got magically enchanted power armours and weapons and more support from back home due to his knowledge sent back getting him more support(seven explorers on seven different worlds, limited resources back home, harry has to find items that make it worthwhile to support him further. Rad-x, rad-away, power armour, a geck, and so on show he's worth investing in more, allowing him better support and a team is sent to test his hypotheses about how potterverse magic will work there.

Characters:

Harry potter:

Chosen one. Boy who lived. First wizard. Mage of mulheim. The black son. The golden seed. The white wizard. Hallowed shadow. Rogue knight. Scarlet demon.

Ciri:

dimensional traveler, trapped for unknown reason. From witcher series.

Curie:

A synth that used to be a ms nanny bot. Becomes harry's science support when he saves her from something. fallout 4

Four other oc companions who will be support staff at base.

Base:

To be decided. Something remote.

Sirius:

reincarnated with full memory, pretty sure he's in hell. Meets a woman who says he'll reconnect with Harry. Starts leaving clues as a member of a vigilante group.

Katty:

Dudley's foster- and god-daughter. Her mother died in childbirth. Raised by harry and dudley's foster-mom until she passed during the war.

Dudley:

Harry's foster-brother. The two were put into foster care after vernon killed petunia and five others drunk driving then hung himself in shame because he was fired from grunnings. Married Dean and ran a comic shop until the war. Now provides a weekly magazine of news, entertainment, and the like for muggles and wizards now that the statute is no longer in effect.

Hp world:

devastated by atomic fire. Tbc

The new world:

An amalgamation of fallout's earth and elder scroll's nirn. Post the war, magic becomes resurgent and once mostly dormant cults of daedric and divine worshippers are able to convene with their gods. Once, old stones that were just curious reminders of forgotten cults became able to give supplicants boosts.

The ability to imbue weapons and armour with various abilities from both series via harry's disassembling by hand and reassembling weapons via reparo to create a new weapon(harry revolutionizes artificing by accident). Same with armor. The aura that the weapons and armour hold jump to the soul crystals(instead of holding souls). Takes place in Georgia, us.

Geogia: Has a massive soda factory[competitor to nuka cola based on pepsi even though nuka seems to be a coca cola reference which kinda sucks since coke is headquartered in atlanta], five universities, two army bases, an air base, [still figuring out alt georgia's buildings]

The original idea for this was mages escaping a destroyed earth only to find they were in another post apocalyptic wasteland, the fallout 'verse. Then I decided maybe it should be a wizard exploring a potential new world to colonize. Then I thought "what if Harry finds Sirius in this new world?" Then I thought "what if I did a story I wish bethesda did where elder scrolls and fallout are combined, where the two worlds are combined, with dwarves, daedra, and so on being allies and/or hazards in the new 'verse?" Then I thought, "fuck it, combine 'em all."

Reparo

Disarming

Aguamenti

magic lockpick
