The Memory Box - Bella EB.

Hands down one of the best. Sadly it is only available in a printer friendly version on Google, but the sequel "The Never Forgotten" is on HPFF.

I have waited for years for this story to be updated but there has been no word from the author, I hope it gets updated before 2020 :(.

Followed this story since she was still writing the original one until now, and it's been 6 long years.

I really really recommend this fanfic for anyone who enjoys Marauders era stories (it is basically during Order of the Phoenix where HP gets a memory box containing memories from his mother and her friends). My slight description doesn't do JUSTICE to how good this story is.

Please give it a read and post your feedback here. Hopefully Bella EB will see this one day and maybe update the story.

Thank you for your time.

** I'm getting through this but I'm far from convinced its a great story.

The printer friendly format definitely doesn't help - it's sometimes difficult to see when scenes begin and end. The frequent spelling errors keep distracting me too.

There have also been a couple of situations where the characters were trying to solve a puzzle and the answer was obvious. Somehow the most brilliant people in the year couldn't work out the answer when someone with a few glasses of wine spotted the answer ages before it became a question.

The basic idea behind the story just doesn't work given what transpires,, but I can ignore that.

On the other hand...

There's some great characterisation here. Others have done better but this is good.

The story confronts some things I've not seen link many other stories, and this one does it better.

I'll keep reading to the end but I doubt I'll agree with your assessment.

** Not sure if you'll even see this but I just want to say you are 100% right!! Best FanFic ever to be written about this era. I downloaded the PDF to my iBooks and listen/re-read the story over and over! I am OBBSESSED! If Bella EB ever sees this PLEASE update the sequel, I have been waiting years and am SUCH a huge fan! But this story is perfect, I am in love, and I recommend 10/10!

** Yes I've read that too! I just want to know what happens next so bad! It must be hard for her to keep it as realistic as possible though esp. since Sirius dies in that book :/
