I most likely read this only a week or two ago but my memory is a bit messed up.

It was a story where in 6th year when Dumbledore gets his hand cursed someone(Harry?) cuts it off.

Thanks in advance.


** Er, Dumbledore's hand getting cursed is from cannon - most 6th year stories have that. I don't particularly remember any story where it gets cut off. Any other hints about the story to help you find it?
