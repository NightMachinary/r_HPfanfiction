Just want to know if it exists. Preferably more than 10k+ words. Please tell me such a thing exists. Doesn't have to have his powers, as long as he has the personality it would be hilarious, just imaging the way he'll react to Snape, or Voldemort, or even Hermione.

Thanks, Warryn.

  Unexpected time travel can provide endless hours of entertainment...if you do it right. Under any other circumstances Harry would have done everything in his power to set things right the Gryffindor way. Too bad he's learned a lot since that final battle. Meet the biggest prankster in the Ministry's dreaded Audit department, and with one heck of a grudge to grind!

  (Bashing! Lunar Harmony Poss Harem! Crackfic!) Based on, but not a full response to, DZ2's "Eyeballs to Entrails" challenge. Abducted after his Fourth Year, Harry finds his abductor to be a most unusual person indeed: rising Queen of Magical Britain's Vampires and Pudding Club leader, Luna Lovegood. And she intends to make him her consort, an offer he is surprisingly amenable to...

*** Sadly i'm not a fan of how Quatermass writes his stories, and i've tried reading stories that caught my interest in the past before, and never got far.

Best Solved Cold is a story I eagerly await to update.

Thanks, Warryn.
