I just came across somebody on DeviantArt who has a bit of a thing for gender switching all the HP characters - [[http://maaria.deviantart.com/art/Harriet-Potter-267897457][Link]]

To me, what really stands out incredibly is her portrayal of the Fem!Twins. So I'm now inspired on a new quest. Has anybody done with words what she did with pixels? Hopefully decently.

BTW - her Marauders are also pretty damn good - [[http://maaria.deviantart.com/art/Marauders-325333252][Link]] - are Fem!Marauders a thing, perchance?


** Well, there's "Harry Potter and the Distaff Side". Harry ends up in a universe where about everyone he knows are the other gender.

  Voldemort knows the prophecy, when he is reborn following the 3rd task of the Triwizard Tournament he takes action to ensure that Harry is no longer a threat. AU. HPLL This story will be updated slowly so that I can finish my other stories.

*** Darn-it - it's as if the fan art I linked to were illustrations specially done for that particular story. Though the twins only get walk-on parts, unfortunately.
