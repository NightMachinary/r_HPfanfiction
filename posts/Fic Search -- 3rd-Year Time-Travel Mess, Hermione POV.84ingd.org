I'm looking for a story I read years ago, in which some future Hermione interferes with 3rd-year Hermione's life via time-turner. 3rd-year Hermione stumbles upon Sirius Black, is convinced of his innocence, and tries to help him while dealing with the timey-whimey mess her future self has created. It describes time travel more than once as a golden thread, and Hermione later sees it as a sphere made out of the golden threads of her time travel looping back on itself. It has a vague prologue I believe, and features Hermione as the main character from 3rd-person narration, Sirius Black as a supporting character, and Harry and Ron very much as secondary/minor character.


** Out of Time by Rurouni Star

- I love this fic so much! There's a sequel too (4th year)

  -mild SBHG- Hermione's got a convenient new thing called a timeturner that lets her get to classes in third year. But suddenly, a message from herself has her housing a known convict, and it's not so convenient anymore...
