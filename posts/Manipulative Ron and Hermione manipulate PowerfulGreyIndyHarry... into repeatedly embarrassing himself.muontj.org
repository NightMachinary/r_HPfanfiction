Harry, after having become Powerful!Grey!Indy, cuts ties with his "manipulative spying friends who drag him down". Ron and Hermione decide, if he thinks they've been always manipulating him, they may as well start.


** "Go to the goblins and have them do an inheritance test, Harry. You're probably the lord of a lot of things."

*** That's too straightforward. More Slytherin cunning is needed to trick the great Indy!Harry.

"Hey, Ron, do you think Harry knows of all his lordships?" Hermione asked when she saw Harry was close enough to overhear.

"Of course not! Every year we go with him to Gringotts, and we make sure to keep him well away from the inheritance tests. We also take from his money while we're at it, and even if he goes to complain, he won't get anywhere cause he doesn't know the special goblin greetings."

"Yea, I can see him trying to be polite and courteous. He has no idea he needs to greet them with something like 'may your gold flow as fast as your enemies blood' and insult them while he's at it."

** Harry sits down for dinner. He suddenly spots Ron quickly hiding what looks like an empty phial in his robes. Hermione gives him a meaningful look and whispers, "Ron what are you doing? Didn't we agree you'll give the love potion to the House Elves to put it in his food?"

"I gave the House Elves the love potion to put in the treacle tart. This is the magical core blocker that I put in the steak and kidney pudding. We don't want to kill him remember?" Ron whispered back.

"Ah you're right. The old goat said he needs to walk to his own death willingly," responded Hermione while giving Harry a totally-not-suspicious quick glance.

"I think I am not hungry tonight," announced Harry to his harem of adoring girls as he got up without touching his food. "I think I'll just go to bed."

"Are you OK?" asked Daphne, who for some reason was at the Gryffindor table, "You haven't touched any of your food."

"Yeah. She's right," added Tonks who was also at the table. "After playing all day with your runes, you sure must be hungry."

"I'm fine. Besides I think someone's up to no good at this table - NEVILLE DON'T EAT THAT!" Harry shouted as he spotted Neville taking a spoonful of treacle tart and proceeding to knock the spoon out of his hand.

"What's wrong Harry?" asked Luna concerned.

"This guy has laced the treacle tart with love potion!" he suddenly announced pointing his finger at Ron. "I bet he was trying to get me to fall in love with his sister."

"I did what now?" asked Ron innocently.

"I overheard you talking with Granger. I saw you hiding the phial in your pocket! I overheard you talking about pouring magic core blocker in the steak Don't lie!"

"What?" asked Hermione. "That was just olive oil he added to his steak and kidney pudding. They don't serve it here at Hogwarts and I brought him a bottle from my trip to Italy this summer. Show him, Ron!"

Ron pulls out the empty phial which has residues of a green oily substance on its walls.

"What about the treacle tart laced with love potion?"

"I have no clue what you're talking about," Ron shrugged.

"I am watching you!"

"Harry, my love, don't you think you're being overly paranoid?" asked Susan Bones comfortingly while rubbing his back and try to get him to sit down.

"I'm not paranoid. I'm pretty sure these two are up to something-" "What seems to be the problem here?" the stern voice of Professor McGonagall interrupted them.

"They are trying to poison me," Harry responded pointing his finger at Ron and Hermione.

"Mr. Weasley? Miss Granger? Are you trying to poison Mr. Potter over here?"

Both Ron and Hermione gave her an innocent look, "No, Professor."

"I overheard them how they laced the treacle tart with love potion so that I would fall in love with Ginny Weasley," Harry insisted.

"Those are some serious accusations Mr. Potter. Here at Hogwarts we don't take lightly on love potions. Let me taste," said McGonagall as she took a spoon of treacle tart and ate it.

After she finished ingesting it, "Well Mr. Potter this is a good treacle tart but I can assure I don't feel any attraction towards Miss Weasley. I suggest you enjoy your dinner and stop making a scene."

"But-"

*** "Anyways Miss Granger, Mr. Weasley you get seven years worth of detention for making Mr. Potter feel uncomfortable. You're lucky you didn't draw your wands out or I'd have you expelled," added McGonagall before departing for the teacher's table.

****** You joke, but in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Witch Queen by TimeLoopedPowerGamer), McGonagall /does/ age more slowly due to her mastery of Transfiguration, but she magically disguises herself to look older than her biological age in order to command more authority with the students.

  After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness. But despite having gained great power in exchange for a bargain with the hidden Fae, she is still unable to kill the immortal Dark Lord. As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.
