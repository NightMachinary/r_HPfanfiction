** I read a very sad little oneshot several years back where Ginny was dosing him with his knowledge and permission because he was gay and hated himself? I think it got deleted because I tried to find it last year and couldn't

** “An Hour of Wolves by thebiwholived” linkao3(14164617) ... the story is about rape, so beware that it is not nice reading and if it triggers something for you, be warned!

** linkao3(592519)

This is a pretty sad one, obviously, but I think it fits your request. To summarize, post-DH, pre-epilogue Hermione finds out that Ron gave her a love potion and raises hell about it, or she tries to. It turns out that love potioning is more common and more accepted than she ever knew. Ginny is potioning Harry without him knowing, but when he finds out he's initially ok with it because he likes feeling in love with her.

Edit: I think the bot didn't work because I linked the series page not a story page. Here's the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/592519][link]]
