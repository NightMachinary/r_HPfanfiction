  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

**** No long term pairings so far. Some characters do date. Romance is not heavy.

Spoilers: Daphne and Harry do date but they break up. It's not featured heavily.
