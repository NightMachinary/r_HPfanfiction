#+TITLE: "Can you explain why the wizards and witches are stealing dinosaur fossils?" asked Hermione angrily. "They didn't steal them, they found them buried in dirt or inside rock also they're one of the important ingredients for potions," answered Ron. "But they should be in a museum!" she said sternly.

"They're found on our land" said Ron. Harry awkwardly puts the fossilized egg down as his friends argue again.

** I'm sorry, but I have to side with Ron here unless I get more information. Unless the fossils were found on private property or protected land (like reserves, parks, etc), the land's contents don't actually belong to anyone and so, fossils, not belonging to anyone, can be dug up and used however the person or people who dug them up want. What is petrol but liquid fossils used to make money by powering cars among other things?

*** Fun legal fact that's actually relevant here for once: all things buried under the ground that are valuable belong to the queen by royal perogative once it's old enough that the true owner can't be found, which is the kind of useless fact only law nerds and Hermione bother to know

***** I want to write a legal dissertation on how on Earth magical British law works, at some point, because it's all just a big mess.

You can claim mind control and don't need to provide evidence (Lucius Malfoy) Minor child discipline matters require the entire House of Lords (Harry's underage magic trial) There's very little separation of powers (everything dumbledore does) There are no privacy laws (Moodys eye, Rita Skeeter) or just laws about the press in general (Rita Skeeter)

How does citizenship work? If they're British citizens, why is Azkaban legal? If they aren't, why do they have to inform the British PM of everything? (I have so many questions about why the PM. He's busy with his own country - why can't you talk to the ministers?)

It's a rabbit hole.

****** Totally, even more so because we see it from the perspective of teenagers who doesn't really try going through the legal channels of his own initiative, meaning that things like Rita Skeeter and his trial could easily be or not simply illegal and we would have no clue. We are never actually given an explanation for most of Dumbledore's titles and jobs, so he could be anything from the power behind the throne of magical Britain to the tired and exasperated babysitter whose jobs is only to keep the adults responsible for the running of the country from diving the nation headfirst into a volcano or kill each other over cauldron bottom thickness. And to say nothing of the fact that historically on England the authority, land and power of the lords comes from the crown, so either there is no House of Lords /at all/ in the wizarding world, they are somehow beholden to the Queen despite having their own nation which is by all appearances independent from muggle Britain or there is some kind of wizarding royalty we are just never told about.

And the whole thing with the PM is really confusing, neither Scrimgron nor Fudge seemed to be under the PM's authority in any way, shape or form, in fact the whole meetings are reminiscent more of a diplomatic encounter between heads of state rather than anything else, but they were still having the PM take a guard they choose for him /and/ keeping him somewhat abreast of the way the war is going. My best guess is that there is /some/ cooperation between the government to get information about magical criminals hiding in the muggle world and trying to keep crazies from using the imperius on the higher-ups of the muggle government to start a nuclear war or something of the sort, but this is more of a head-cannon than anything actually said about the situation through any means (also have on about there being a curse on the PM's position like the one for DADA teacher to make them keep to the Statute, only way I can think of to explain why /none/ of the many people who held the office decided to blow the Statute wide-open, even if there was a rational explanation the simple fact is that not everyone that got elected was rational).

******* I think the whole Lord thing is more like a bunch of magical clans, and the queen/king and prime minister don't have any control over the magical world, only the right to be informed as they have basically the same territories, and some of their citizens become magical citizens. Since the queen has no control, families can gain lordships, but I think it is based on influence, power, wealth, age, "purity", etc, and the other existing Clans vote on it, and sometimes a Wizengamot seat comes from it

*** Public property would also technically count. Common ground in the UK is often owned by the local council (and by extension, the government) and the Queen has some bizarre semi-claim to a lot of the rest of it. Could be an argument that fossils in a lot of land would belong to the Muggle Govt. or the queen.
