** TBH many places with co-ed student housing have this policy. Girls can enter boys' dorms but boys can't enter girls'. Not that it stops horny couples or close friends who just want to have a slumber party in peace.

I'd appreciate an attempt that didn't fall back into pearl clutching slut shaming.

*** It's just as sexist to even have such a one-way policy at all, as if girls can't be sexual beings or whatever. Like they wouldn't WANT TO sneak up for a boy in the boy's dorm of their own initiative.

*** I've never heard of it myself. I've heard of students being banned after a certain time though.

** There was one fic that referenced this (Neville commented on it) but I can't for the life of me remember it. It was in the early years, like 1-2.

*** Think it's Mishief's Heir series, Harry finally gets a parental figure and learns to put up boundaries. I think Percy called her a scarlet woman for being in the boys dorm.
