Before the second rise of Voldemort, Arthur weasly was well liked by just about everybody in the ministry and wizardgamot.

Everybody has their loyalties straight, nobody is going to betray the dark lord for him, but he is a likeable guy, that is honest and with ulterior motives and tries to get along with everyone, always making jokes and talking amicably with his fellow ministry employees, even the darker wizards. Even Lucious didn't completely hate him, even if outwardly, it seems otherwise.

The light wizards supported him in just about anything, and the dark ones stayed out of his way, with snide remarks of "it's just weasely, what can he do?"


** There was one fic where Arthur was a bad ass unspeakable during the original war with Voldie. I think he was called The Ghost? Some of his boys find out and they help him. Can't remember the name though.
