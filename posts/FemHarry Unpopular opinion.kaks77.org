Harriet / Henrietta / Hadriana ect. in fanfics are horrible names for a girl in my humble opinion. Every single time I read this kind of names I cringe hard.

Am I the only one who thinks that? What are some other horrible names?

(Sorry if it offends you)


** Honestly I hate Fem!Harry for exactly this reason. I've never heard a name I can stand. Holly is the best one, and I Don't love that either. Weirdly I've never seen her named Harriet.

*** I'm pretty sure Harriet is the most used name for fem!harry in fanfiction. Holly is a good name tho, as is Hope.

** When I'm writing a fem!Harry I go with flower names, like Lily and Petunia. Iris is probably my favorite.

** What offends me is that somebody is so hung up on the name of the character, it seems like more than on the story itself.

*** Names matter. For example, there's this very Dark and Serious and Profound fic out there called /River Styx/, in which Harry joins Voldemort. Its Dark and Serious and Profound themes are somewhat subverted when said Dark!Smart!Powerful!Harry takes up the title *Dark Lord Filldeserp*.

***** Right? It's like having canned laughter trigger every time the protagonist appears in the scene.

** I seriously cannot read any fics where female harry is referres as “Harry” or “Alex” for Alexandra.

Like seriously, have you ever heard someone call a girl as “Harry”???

Cant you just come up with a different name? Any damn name!

I also dislike Rose, mostly because its extremely overused and seems to be the no1 choice.

I want to read a story where i can immerse myself with the female lead, and not be reminded of Harry fcking Potter and feel that its just a transgender harry with different gender pronouns.

** Honestly, so long as the name makes sense, I'm not really bothered. People seem to forget that names have to be given or taken, so they have to fit what the character's carers or the character themselves would actually choose and/or find a story to make it work (how they found the name, or how they decided on it).

It's especially a thing with carers - people tend to name their kids either things they like the sound of or things they hope the kid will be. So, if you think James and Lily or Petunia and Vernon (or whomever else is raising Harry) would pick those names, or that Harry would happily take that name, then as far as I'm concerned, writers should go right ahead.

** Iris is nice. I've seen Hadria before. Forgot the name but Grindelwald adopted her and didn't like Harriet.

I have never seen a Lana Potter. It'd be kind of nice

** Hadriana? I've never seen that one, was it all the usual Lord Hadrian nonsense with fem!Harry cliches added on top?

I usually like ones that go with a flower name. It fits what we know of the Evans family naming theme and is a lot less jarring to read.

**** That's not even the worst of it. Why in the hell is Margaret Weasley the 'proper' name for Molly? Why is the author using dollars instead of pounds? Lilith for Lily? Blocked cores and blood-adoption? Muggles bombing wizards and exterminating wizardkind? Just a hot mess, and this is all in the first chapter!

***** Molly is actually a nickname for Margaret. That said, canon doesn't give any name other than Molly. (Just like Percy is not Percival.)
