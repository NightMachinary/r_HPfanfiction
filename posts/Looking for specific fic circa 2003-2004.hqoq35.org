:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Used to read it in high school on ff.net but never finished it. I can't remember much of the plot except it was a Draco/ginny fic (cause that was my thing back then) and maybe included Harry/Hermione too but also some kind of chapters where the group sees visions of the founders of Hogwarts and how they are channeled reincarnations of some sort. It was a long fic I would catch up in for hours at a time but what I remember most about it is that the author sometimes included links to her own illustrations to accompany the story that had a particular style. [[https://imgur.com/24dFftK][Here]] is an emulation of her Hermione I remember bc I was learning to draw during that time and recreated her style. I want to finish the story if she ever finished it but can't for the life of me remember the whole plot or the name/author.

Any info is appreciated!! =D


** I don't know if Cassandra Claire ever drew but this sounds like The Draco Trilogy. Draco Dormiens, Draco Sinister and Draco Veritas. Part two - Draco Sinister involves a vision and the founders amongst other things. It was removed from the internet in 2006sih? idk. she's a famous author now but I'm sure someone still has copies.

*** There are definitely still copies. I got PDFs a few years ago just by Googling. I know Enchanting the Bookworm on FB has all of them in their files. But yeah, they were taken down when people called her out for plagiarizing huge chunks of the Draco Trilogy.

*** This whole thing sounds so familiar this might be it and now that you mention it, she may have included illustrations from a friend, but I'm gonna look into this thank you!!!

*** This was exactly it. A little deeper searching and I found out this is what I was looking for!! I knew it had to be some epic piece, as I don't read a TON of ff back then and all the sites kept mentioning the Draco Trilogy. It's all coming back to me now.

Omg the power of the internet (read: the HP fandom).

Fanlore even has a [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/M._Starling][page]] mentioning the artist. Thank you, thank you, thank you!
