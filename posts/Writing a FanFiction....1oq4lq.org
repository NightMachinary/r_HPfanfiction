** My suggestion is to put this idea on a shelf until you get more practice. It hurts, I know. But there is a reason you should wait. Just note down everything you can think of about this idea somewhere. Keep adding to those notes as you come up with more thoughts, but don't really start writing at story yet.

This is because I strongly suggest you first do [[http://nanowrimo.org/][NaNoWriMo]] (National Novel Writing Month) this November. Use another idea you come up with over the next couple of weeks.

NaNoWriMo is, in its most basic form, a challenge to write a small novel (or a good stab at one) in a month. Towards this end, you are self-directed to write at least 50,000 words in the month of November on one novel project. There is no required signup, there is no set prize for doing this. Just personal achievement.

Write about 1700 words every day in November, on any story idea you come up with. Doing it every day is the biggest challenge for me, but there is also working around what happens in life to keep you from writing while still keeping up your weekly word count. When you're done (and have "won" NaNoWriMo by finishing your word count, if not your novel), take that partially completed and most likely horrible story disaster (it will be bad) and put it aside for a while.

Then use the lessons you learned during that month to make your current favorite idea into a much, much better fic using the notes you've been making. [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/1nvj1y/ff_writers_how_do_you_like_to_write_your_fics/][See this thread]] for more details about how some other people write, including my own terrifying process.

*TL;DR* - Look into [[http://nanowrimo.org/][NaNoWriMo]]. Write every day. Have fun if you can, but don't only write when you have fun.

And try not to listen to people who tell you to write like Palahniuk (and ignore his writing advice).

Good writing.

** There are probably some past threads here that talk about some of their biggest pet peeves, check them out and try to avoid them. Learn which cliches to avoid in your story.

Decide what kind of story it's going to be. Is it a romance novella, a oneshot (i.e., one chapter) "crack" fic, etc? It's going to be hard to mix serious and funny if the fic focuses on Voldemort. Most Voldemort focused fics tend to be either a) dark fics with moral ambiguity and murders of somewhat innocent people, or b) humor/crack fics where the slavish devotion of the Death Eaters and Voldemort's choice in outfits is played for laughs.

A lot of writers find someone to beta their work, either through forums or by looking at the database on ff.net and picking a few at random to PM. Betas can do anything from brainstorm plot twists to telling you that something is confusing/contradictory to just polishing up grammar.

Plan in a way that makes you feel comfortable. Every writer has a different way of organizing their thoughts. [[http://fr.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/1nvj1y/ff_writers_how_do_you_like_to_write_your_fics/][Here's]] a thread with a few different strategies. JKR makes [[http://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/jkrowlingpage.jpg][graphs]].

Write whether you're in the mood or not. The point is to have something on paper.

** I'm a new writer as well. I never published any fanfiction. I only published once to see what it looked like when reading on fanfiction.net

Anyway, like LeLapinBlanc and OP said, I like to keep small journal and pen with me most of time. I like to expand background or personalities of the characters I'm writing...His/her parents' name? Pureblood, Halfblood or Muggleborn? Were their families killed at First Wizarding War? Which side they were on and if they switched sides (Voldemort, Dumbledore, Harry or neutral), why?

I like to have rich information because I think it will be easier to write... You look up character info before you write to stick to character you created.

Also try to be unique.

** First of all, welcome to Reddit (officially, you little lurker you) and to the world of HP fanfic writers (of which I am a member myself, haha).

I don't know what you're looking for exactly as help, but I'll give you the best tip ever: just write.

Whether you're in the mood or not... just write.

Whether you feel inspired or not... just write.

And write for yourself, not for others. If you enjoy what you're writing, how your story is unfolding itself, it'll be a fun adventure for yourself and it'll shine through your stories. When you share it with others, then you'll have feedback, see what was liked and not, if you want to change something or not.

A good thing to have is a beta-reader before posting your stories online. Not necessary if you're good in spelling and grammar, but useful otherwise. I have a great beta and like sharing my ideas with her, see what she thinks, etc...

If you have more specific questions, I can try answering them, but I'm relatively new myself (Have been writing for a year and a half, two fanfics completed)

Good luck (and have fun).

**** You're welcome! I just noticed you started out of the blue like myself, and that's what I learned about writing up till now.

Sometimes, no, often, I sabotage my own writing because I focus too much on what others will think... do not do that!

Good initiative to have something on hand to write down your ideas. They pop in my head any time of the day and I usually have to write them down fast, or risk losing them. (I lost a great plot a few weeks ago because I was certain I wouldn't forget it... and, of course, I did. Uhm... maybe it wasn't so great after all. Haha!)

Anyway, good luck and all! I'll look forward to reading your story when its done :)
