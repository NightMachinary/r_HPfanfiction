I'm looking for some good, well written fanfiction with no bashing. At all. It's fine if flaws are pointed out, as long as the author doesn't needlessly bash characters. Preferably starting from at least first year. Bonus points if the fic explores magic and magical community deeply and Harry gets stronger along with his friends (I would prefer the golden trio.) Something like The Accidental Animagus or The Arithmancer? I prefer the former.

Unrelated side note: New to Reddit so if someone could tell me how to add links to posts, I would be grateful.

Great Dumbledore mentor fic with a frankly original point of divergence in fourth year linkffn(12648415)

​

This is delightfully fun. Does a fantastic job of avoiding stations of canon as Harry pretty much ignores everything he's not interested in. Starts in first year. linkffn(12703694)

Features smart, lucky, goofball Ravenclaw Harry. Starts in first year. linkao3(2337458)

​

Post-war reconstruction fic with an emphasis on healing divisions between people linkffn(13022013)

​

A Sirius becomes Lord Black to take custody of Harry fic. Dumbledore is canon level manipulative, but the fic is careful to skate by the usual bashing cliches. linkao3(1085412)

** linkffn(The Legacy by storytellerspw; The Mind Arts; Eclipse of the Sky; Mistakes and Second Chances; Grow young with me)

In Mistakes, it may look like Dumbledore-Bash, but there's a reason, and it tones down 100% later on. It also doesn't have the Trio, because of reasons, but there is Hermione as main friend. Even though GYWM is post-war, its one of the best trio feelsgoodman friendships imo. Mind Arts also has no trio, even if he befriends Hermione for awhile. It does have indepth magics and explores the magical community and lore.

Eclipse is simply fantastic, one of my favourite Ron's, a great Hermione that actually feels like that canon part where she's a daredevil (she lured Umbridge to be gangbanged by centaurs and a giant). The OC is wonderful imo, def not a mary-sue and the romance part is delightful. For me at least.

The Legacy is imo, the best contract fic there is, with a completely unique Daphne, a Trio that each has a specialty and are fairly cohesive.

I would recommend a few more but they were posted already.

#+begin_quote
  A young Harry learns the everyday power of words. He's going to make the Dursleys happy by being "normal". Then they'll love him, just like they love Dudley! It's a flawless plan... right? Smart!Harry, Manipulative!Harry, canonical level child neglect/abuse. Complete. Part 1 of the "Perfectly Normal" series.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

**** It sounds interesting. I was hoping more Harry and his friends gradually getting stronger and navigating the mess that is the Wizarding World. But I'll give this a try. As soon as I finish reading all the ones I've opened up in fifteen tabs of my browser. Also, Harry raised by decent muggles and having the common sense most wizards lack would be welcome too.

** To make a link, put the display text in [square brackets], then put the URL afterward in (round brackets).

Also, this subreddit has a helpful bot for linking and summarising stories; you can see examples in the other comments. It's pretty good at guessing the story from just an approximate title, but you can also add "by Joe Bloggs" to narrow it down, or just use the story ID, or the full URL to the story.
