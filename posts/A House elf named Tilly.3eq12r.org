...e.g. all of them.

Why are all house elves named Tilly? (only a slight exaggeration) What am I missing? Is it a loving tribute to some fic? Does everyone just really really love my childhood dog?


** I kinda want naming a house elf after a political rival to be a thing. I can imagine Lucius getting a cheap giggle out of summoning "Albus" to bring him tea or whatever else it is evil ponces do with their magical slaves.

** It's like Dan and Emma as the Hermione's parents. It's lazy, sounds okay, and fits the Dobby, Winky, Hokey trend. I wonder why Kreacher doesn't have a similar name. I do think Tilly is better than some of the names. Some fics have the Malfoy house elves with Roman names which makes no sense. I can't see the Malfoys giving house elves human names-they don't deserve it in their eyes.

*** Just because it is easy doesn't mean it's lazy, or wrong. I prefer Dan/Emma for Hermiones parents because it just makes things so much simpler than having to remember Robert and Josaphene or whatever. Same thing with Tilly, if you need a generic house elf name, go for it.

**** I agree. Not everything needs to be new and imaginative in a fic. We are reading fanfiction, after all. The entire point is to have a worthwhile base and work off of it.

**** There's nothing wrong with it, but it is nice to see some originality. It's been a while since I looked it up, but Emma doesn't make much sense as a name for dr. Granger. It doesn't fit in with the names of the period she would have been born. IIRC, it doesn't become popular until the late 60s or the 70s.

*** There's one fanfic where an eccentric Pureblood family named all their elves after Roman generals, but that is a very eccentric fanfic itself so... I could only see the Malfoys giving their elves human-inspired names like "Bumblebore" or "Potty" just to feel superior, but not like, actual people names.

To be fair the elves might name their own children and what we're getting are just examples of elf culture.

** Here are some possible sources for house elf names (a bit of fudging on the spelling is required here and there, be warned):

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobby_%28cloth%29][Dobby]] is a /"is a woven fabric produced on the dobby loom, characterised by small geometric patterns and extra texture in the cloth"/ (Wikipedia). So his name could he a reference to the cloth he wears. Doby also means /time/ in Czech...so there's that.

Tilly can be slang for /utility/, which makes sense in this context. *Tily* means /watchman/ in Malagasy, the language of Madagascar. Tilly is also the title of a poem by James Joyce about a cattle herder (maybe all those fanfic authors are just J.J. groupies)

Kriecher means /crawler, groveller, bootlicker, sycophant or toadie/ in German. I think this fits Kreacher's personality, and perhaps JRK chose it with this in mind? It is also a homophone to /creature/ which also fits well.

In general I think the names are chosen to be offensive in their shortness and banality:

#+begin_quote
  /Spittle flew as Lucius raged at the presumptuous female house elf, "That is our word! You don't get to use that word!" he frothed eloquently, "Steve" is too good of a name for the likes of your spawn! I shall rename him Dicky!"./

*** I think I've read at least a dozen where Dorea Potter has a house elf named Tilly. I think "light" or "good" people tend to have it as a house elf name. It can be a human name, but it also fits the typical house elf moue.

** I've never used Tilly.

I named one Urkel- he was the headmaster's spy and was killed by Dobby on order of his mistress. Another was Clinker- named specifically for the sound his wire-and-bottle-bottom glasses made when he disappeared. In an unpublished piece I have an American elf-guild elf show up wearing a mummy-style shroud of woven red tape. I'm thinking his name should be Bibblespink.

EDIT: Just remembered the two other elves I gave the Malfoys- Froople and Yappi.
