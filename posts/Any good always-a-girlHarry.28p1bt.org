I've read all of kilara25's trilogy of one-shots. They are very good. I'm not into femslash, and don't like Draco/Harry. I'm pretty much open to anything as long it's decently written and doesn't have previously mentioned pairings. It doesn't even have to have pairings.


** I haven't read many, but I have a couple. There is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4040192/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Girl-Who-Lived]] which actually features both a male Harry and a female Harry.

Then there is also [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/]] but this one contains femslash in the sequal.

** The completed [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/1/Princess-of-the-Blacks][Princess of the Blacks]] and WIP sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9937462/1/Black-Princess-Ascendant][Black Princess]] by Silently Watches.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8175132/1/Jamie-Evans-and-Fate-s-Fool][Jamie Evants and Fate's Fool]] by mad mad reviewer. Completed. Sequel started recently, but is posted very slowly.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4916690/1/Holly-Evans-and-the-Spiral-Path][Holly Evans and the Spiral Path]] by wordhammer. Completed, also with a WIP sequel. I haven't read this, and so I can't really say if its good or not.

*** Thanks for the mention, but in all, these are the stories that don't quite fit the original request. Jamie, Holly and Jennifer are all more fond of girls, though there's some fun interaction between Jen and Viktor Krum in Princess. Also, Holly and Jamie aren't originally girl!Harry.

What all these stories do have (in contrast to most fem-Harry stories) are strong central characters, epic battle scenes and quite a bit of no-nonsense dark magic. That, and the authors write with an ending in mind, as demonstrated by having complete first stories in all three cases.

Just trying to provide full disclosure, here.

**** Good points, thanks!. I just saw the girl!Harry and posted. I'll typically post stories if they are somewhat close to the original request.

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/536450/chapters/952621][The Never-ending Road]] by laventadorn is definitely my favorite. Two caveats: it is a WIP and it is eventually Harry/Severus, BUT nothing happens while Harry (Harriet) is underage. In fact, the fic is 446,164 in and they are nowhere near a romantic relationship yet. It was also updated less than a month ago, so it is not abandoned. Anyway, here's the summary: "AU. When Lily died, Snape removed his heart and replaced it with a steel trap. But rescuing her daughter from the Dursleys in the summer of '92 is the first step on a long road to discovering this is less true than he'd thought. A girl!Harry story, starting in Chamber of Secrets and continuing through Deathly Hallows. Future Snape/Harriet."

Another good one that is complete is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8121773/1/Of-Power-and-Prestige][Of Power and Prestige]] by Ell Roche and ExcentrykeMuse, but it is so AU that you almost can't call it a girl!Harry, except for the fact that her father is James Potter and her name begins with an H. It's very different from canon, even the magical world and the politics/society is very different, but it's really good. "Nothing could tempt Marvolo, Lord Slytherin, to leave the Lone Islands---except, perhaps, for Lady Haesel Potter, the most powerful witch of her generation. TMR/Fem!Harry."

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7905430/1/Life-As-She-Knows-It][Life As She Knows It]] is pretty good as well. It is also very AU, though perhaps not as drastically as "Of Power and Prestige." It's Harry/Severus, but nothing happens between Hollis and Snape until she is in her twenties. It is also a time travel fic, which I like a lot but I understand is not everyone's cup of tea. BIG WARNING: WIP hasn't been updated since October 2013. "Hollis Potter, with grim determination, walks into a battle that will make or break England - and affect the World War raging around them. The outcome is surprising, even for her, and she is left with nothing to do but adapt. TimeTravel / FemHP."

And finally, this one I don't remember much about. It's a WIP, last updated in January, but I haven't read it since I added it to my story alerts a year ago. If you're anything like me, you read so many fics that you can't always remember which was which. That's the case here, so I can't say much about it other than the fact that I apparently liked it enough to follow it. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8299839/1/Alexandra-Potter][Alexandra Potter]] by Taure. "Fem!Harry AU. When she was seven years old, Alexandra Potter discovered she had special powers. She thought she was the only one, but then a letter comes and reveals to Alex a world she never knew existed. Will she become the hero so many believe her to be? Or will she lose herself to the temptations of power? Character-driven story, lots of world building. Not a canon rehash."

There you are. Hope you like them.
