Spoilers for part 1: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4n2q8p/i_think_we_may_have_had_an_influence_on_rowling/]]

I would once again remind you before saying the spoilers that none of these are confirmed to be true, but I'm starting to believe it now. With that said, obvious spoiler warning for CC, so either click away or place a bucket over your head and hit it with a spoon.

[[/spoiler][Ok, so in this act, Snape shows up. I don't know the context, but honestly, this does kind of make sense considering time travel screwing up everything and all that. Speaking of which, apparently the time turner stuff is done which would make me happy, but the damage is done.]]

[[/spoiler][Apparently, Hagrid is dead. Cool. I should care more but anything could happen now, I'm struggling to care. On the plus side, apparently Romione is back. I'm sure some of you don't consider this is a plus side, but I do to the point where I almost forgot all the crap that came in part 1.]]

[[/spoiler][So to those of you who ship Bellatrix and Voldemort, it's canon. Their daughter is Delphi, who supposedly was Amos' niece. Yep]]

That's all so far, I expect more spoilers about this act will be leaked and if so, I'll be sure to update this post. Fairly reasonable stuff compared to everything in part 1. Still hate it though.

  If all this is true, then my god, this is a trainwreck. I've never liked time-turners outside of their canon appearance in the books - what the actual fuck possessed JK to write this, this...GARBAGE? Only thing I'd want to see if the whole Snape-coming-back is true because he's my favorite and all...but that would STILL be GARBAGE. Goodness...I dislike everything I've heard about this play. It sounds like a fanfiction based off popular fanfiction-tropes for Harry Potter. JK should've ended the Potter saga right before the epilogue of the 7th book.

I mean it's pretty much a super powered *Back to the Future 2*. I will certainly not buy the script, and I will not watch the play. This plot is worse than average fanfics.

*** Dude, the play was amazing; the plot is a bag of fandom worse clich√©s, but I SWEAR that as a play it is Amazing. I cried like a baby in a couple of scenes... it is... something to be seem, not read. [[/spoiler][That said, Harry told us something he never told anyone before: he is scared of pigeons!!!!!]]

**** I've come to that conclusion as well. The plot is awful, and it's impressive how many no-no's they managed to cram in there. But I haven't seen the play itself, so I can't fully judge it.

It's no wonder the play is so bad. Rowling apparently wrote it just to fund her addiction to crack cocaine.

*** New "canon" in Harry Potter has nothing to do with Harry Potter fanfiction? Riiight.

Also, some people might not check [[/r/harrypotter]] but do check here. Like me.

And It's not like there's a limit on the amount of stuff that can be posted here, so why does it matter?

ETA: although why there's no link to the HP subreddit a mega thread I don't know. So here [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/4nc1hj/spoilers_cursed_child_megathread_part_2/]]
