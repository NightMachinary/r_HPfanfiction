Inspired by [[http://gerre.deviantart.com/art/petunia-90865435][this picture]], are there any good fics where Petunia is a witch, and goes to Hogwarts with Lily?


** "Petunia Joins the Club" linkffn(7270010) is fairly decent.

  In canon, Petunia Evans wrote a letter pleading to be allowed into Hogwarts. But what if she didn't have to? How many lives would change if Petunia was a Witch too? Major AU!

** linkao3(Petunia Evans, a Retelling by HouseElfMagic)

Neat story where Petunia is a witch, but blocked for a while.

*** I liked the start of the story, but Petunia did a bit too much with magic for a self-taught witch for my suspension of disbelief. It's something many "Independent Harry" stories suffer from as well - if all Harry (or in this case, Petunia) needs to learn magic on par or better than everyone else are books, then what about Hogwarts?

**** In this case, I think it's more something only someone extremely determined would do. Harry would never manage it. Ron never would. Hermione would. Colin Creevy probably would try his best to do as well. My sister would manage it. I wouldn't.

In saying that, I think she did take her OWLS and Newts too early to be believable. I feel books on Animagus training should have been harder to obtain. Apparition should be too tricky to learn without supervision.

#+begin_quote
  Petunia remembered magic. Being young and making things happen--strange things, impossible things--and then the pain when that man took it all away, locked it inside her.She doesn't get it back until Lily's started Hogwarts already and by then she's old enough to decide she wants to keep her own magic a secret.She didn't know that this would ultimately lead her on a quest to raise her nephew and defeat an evil megalomaniac calling himself Voldemort.But, well, here she is. She will do whatever it takes to keep her nephew safe.And hey, if she gets a pseudo father, rescues a convict, makes friends, becomes an almost permanent babysitter to two additional children, and writes books along the way, then that's a definite bonus.

  Petunia loves her little sister Lily more than anything in the world. She would do anything for her. She would watch out for Lily at Hogwarts, protect her during war, and even raise her son. An AU oneshot about the unbreakable bond between sisters, featuring witch!Petunia.

  "For the 5+ Headcanon game, what do you think of an AU in which Petunia is a witch?" Petunia Evans learns important life lessons from the magical world that every proper witch ought to know.
