See title.

I'm seeing quite a few comments in prompts that are just along the lines of "This prompt would never work, it's stupid" - or, in a prompt centered around a certain character, just commenting on how they hate that character. It's annoying and it can de-rail a prompt thread if the thing that's being hated on is some minor detail.

Given we have a rule against bashing request threads, can the same rule be applied to prompts to curb that kind of thing?

To clarify, I have nothing against someone saying "this prompt would also require canon element x/y/z to be changed, just so you're aware" - sometimes a fanfic actually creates a plot-hole by changing one thing but not another, and prompts can forget that. It's cool to warn against that /in a constructive manner/ to improve the quality of fics that might come from the prompt, but it's not okay (in my opinion) to rag on the prompt and the poster for it.


** Prompts need to be subject to criticism, the discussion of the criticism is often better inspiration for authors than the prompts themselves.

And let's be honest, 95% of the prompts are utter rubbish. By criticising them we hopefully, in the long term, improve the quality of the prompts that get posted.

*** Constructive criticism maybe, "I hate <character/trope>/there are AU elements, therefore prompt bad" no.

And you know what'd help with those Sturgeon's Law prompts, which I don't actually see anyone stepping up to do? Making some /centralized/ guidelines and putting them somewhere prominent so it's public knowledge what makes a prompt work.

If you keep running into the same issues, it's worth prominently posting how to avoid them instead of having to repeat them over and over.

So you agree that providing criticism is a good thing? It's just bad criticism you object to.

Unfortunately you have to accept that the bad will happen if you're going to get the good. Much like the issue of 95% of prompts being terrible...to get the occasional good one you have to permit the terrible ones.

I think what OP is saying is that there's a huge difference between "I don't think this prompt would work, because if x never happens it would also affect y," or "this kind of story is really overdone in the fandom, can you be more specific what it is you want out of this prompt" and "lol this idea is really crappy" or "why would you put up a prompt about Umbridge, I hate Umbridge."

The former examples help the prompter to think about what they're asking for, what kind of story they're looking for, and perhaps enables them to refine their posts in the future to make more effective prompts. The latter are a matter of personal taste - just because you think something is a bad idea it doesn't mean others won't want to read it.The former are also polite, whereas the latter are quite rude.

There's a difference between critique/feedback and criticism - ie "OP, have you considered how Remus's werewolf status would affect this prompt because I think what you've suggested wouldn't work with how lycanthropy affects him, at least the way it's presented in canon. Could you provide more details?" is feedback and is constructive. "Werewolf fics are boring and this prompt wouldn't work anyway" is just criticism and not constructive.

*** I don't think so. Prompts aren't trying to /discuss/, they're trying to /inspire people to write/. To that end, discussion is /not/ actually conducive - I have never, /ever/ seen a discussion in a Prompt thread lead to anyone actually writing a fic-let, let alone a "discussion" that devolves into prompt-bashing.

If I wanted a discussion, that's what I'd label the thread. I'd frame it as "Would this be a cool AU to write? Discuss what'd need to change and give your opinions on whether those breaks from canon are okay."

It's discouraging to write a prompt, trying to inspire an author that may be suffering from lack of inspiration, only to hear "this prompt requires AU so it doesn't make sense as a prompt" or "I hate <character/trope>, therefore I hate this prompt".

If you don't like a prompt, you don't write a fic for it - same as if you don't like the trope/idea in a Request thread, you don't offer a suggestion and just let your silence do the talking.

*** Depends. I kind of like writing-prompts sometimes when they actually inspire me to /write/, which is kinda the idea behind having them.

Maybe if prompts were split off into their own, active, sub we could get rid of them here. Actual guidelines to what makes a good prompt would help too - if nothing else it'd weed out the "glorified 3-sentence plotbunny" prompts.

*** As someone who on multiple occasions has been inspired by prompt threads, I'd say please don't. Sometimes people have great ideas but just aren't able to write it themselves. Sometimes the ideas are utter nonsense, but that's fine. We don't say 'don't write fics' just because 90% of everything is terrible; banning prompts for such a reason would be equally frustrating to those of us who appreciate the 10%.

** Why stop there? Let's just ban any criticism at all. /s

Who is going to determine whether the criticism was /in a kind enough manner/ for you to be okay with? How are you proposing such ridiculously vague standards to be equally and objectively enforced?

And anyway, what could there possibly be that needs additional enforcing, that isn't already covered by existing rules, both site- and subreddit-wide?

*** It's actually quite simple. Anything that gets removed under Rule 9 on Request threads, same guideline applies for Prompt threads - so things like just saying "I hate Ron" under a prompt for "Harry and Ron pretend to date as a joke that gets out of hand"? Against the rules. Framing your criticism with "This prompt sucks because <trope/AU element>"? Bye.

Could also include the bit about being able to label "No Discussion" as well, for writing-prompts that you'd consider "finished" as in "nothing more needs to be worked out, the rest is up to authors".

Writing prompts aren't meant to be discussions, in my eyes. If I wanted to know if something was a good idea for a prompt, I'd make a discussion thread asking "Is this a good idea for a writing prompt?" /before/ I put the prompt out there.

With all respect, no one cares about "your eyes." If an author doesn't want discussion, they can just say so. We're all people perfectly capable of communicating with each other without your help or policing.

The comment you've linked attempts to explain your views on what should and shouldn't be allowed. Apparently, feedback/critique and criticism are different in that criticism isn't constructive, and is a matter of personal taste. You do realise that when I said "why not ban all criticism," I was being sarcastic?

This is the question that's being answered. There's a pretty clear line between what is constructive and what isn't. And to be clear, what isn't /kind/ also tends to conveniently fall under the part that isn't /constructive/ - saying you hate the prompt (hate being the keyword) or it will /never/ work because of a thing that can (or can't, if it's the very premise) be changed.

And yes, I am capable of noticing sarcasm thank-you-very-much - it's just worth stating either way.

If it's already covered by a rule, I'd love to /see/ that it is.

** I find discussion stimulating and inspiring, but if you believe that prompts should be a non-interactive feature, I'd like to invite you over to the Challenge section of Fanfiction.net which, like many archive-type sites, is a place that already satisfies your exacting requirements.

As things are, I consider safe spaces to be an infringement of freedom of expression and as such an anathema to most of things I believe in. Something to be opposed.

As the current system of downvoting the less articulate contributions into invisibility is working well enough, I do not see any benefit to further police comments.

TL;DR constructive criticism good, random "I hate this premise" bad, we should police it the same on Prompt threads as we do in Requests.
