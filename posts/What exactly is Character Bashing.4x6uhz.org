Okay, I just realised that the title automatically capitalises each word. I like that. Edit: It only did it in the part where I was writing. Now I look stupid. :x

Alright. I'm trying to learn what it is and you guys are rather smart when it comes down to things you dislike. I'm trying to avoid it as best as I can, but a character clearly hates another character and expresses that often. Is this character bashing? Dumbledore is a great example for obvious reasons. Let's just say my character often calls him manipulative and claims that he has ulterior goals. Now, my character is talking out of his arse and just dislikes said person, so he'll say whatever to make the said person hurt.

My fear is that readers will see it and believe that ‘Dumbledore' is being bashed as they only see what my character sees. I know that a few people in comments have said that they agree with x person and I fear a few are getting sceptical that I'm going to drive into a bash session. It hardly helps that my character does it often and finds things to bitch and moan about on a regular basis... mainly the 'good' guys.

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.

*** What if I actually wanted Ron to be a Death Eater? Back on topic, I doubt I'll ever do that, but I'm still scared that I'm subliminally bashing them by constantly making them out to be bad guys, despite the fact that they're not.

Sigh. I hate this. It's what made me never ask it before as it confuses my small brain. Bashing is horrid, at least in my mind and it can ruin a story and I don't want to be trapped by it and have to explain that I'm not making them out to be bad guys. D:

Also, the squid is a giant Plesiosaur from the Mesozoic Era, he just doesn't need tree fiddy. P.S: it tried to correct 'Plesiosaur' into 'applesauce'.

**** Well Ron could be a death eater. As long as he's a well done character, and not just some sort of cosmic vengeance from an author that doesn't like him, it's not really bashing.

This is your fic, it doesn't need to follow canon even the slightest bit.

Most of the stories where Ron's a death eater are lame, it doesn't mean that it's impossible to make a good story out of it.

Same goes for love potions/Ginny. It bugs me far less, for exemple, than almost all soul bond/harem story (and for those ones it's because it's extremely difficult to make them right, for structural reasons).

Indeed, that. And I'll point out that Rorshach's Blot, with all the faults in his stories, did manage to write one where Ron is actually a dark lord and that particular part of the story is hilarious. So it can be done, one just needs to know how to write it.

***** I have a draft where Ron leaves Harry and Hermione and joins Voldemort. Voldemort, wanting to get to Harry, is slightly blinded by the story of poor Ronald Weasley. Harry stole his girl, he's famous, he has money, etc. Harry learns of this via a vision and goes absolutely ape shit and attacks Ron when he sees them. Shit happens and Harry has Ron tied up in front of his family and then fed him Veritaserum (that Hermione brewed) and it all comes to light that Ron joined to feed information to Harry and Hermione.

Basically, Ron risked his life and did so much that he regrets so that he could gain information for Harry, who turned his entire family against him. I honestly dislike ROn, but he has so much character that he can be portrayed in so many ways and it just working. He's not like Luna, who is amazing, but not flexible.

It's great that I wa sable to ask such a simple question and I got so much help. Gosh, I love this subreddit.

** If you're focusing on an unreliable character's feelings and people are getting upset and saying that you're bashing, are you showing enough of the other side? Is there a way that you can show some good stuff "Dumbledore" is doing- even if your main character doesn't realize it? Or can another character speak up for "Dumbledore"? Even if your main character argues against the other character, maybe it can be in such a way that the audience sees the main character is wrong, or at least there's room for doubt?

*** No one has complained yet (probably because it's unpublished and I send snippets to people) but it's a fear I have. It's a HP fanfiction so I could use the characters but it'd spoil it if you ever read it. I had my character (now it sounds as if I'm talking about a game) sift through the record of the 'good guys' past and he notices things and points 'em out, but nothing like that.

So unless I make it highly one-sided, then I should be free from CB?

**** Well, if there's a record of this person's wrongdoing and it's objective, then that might actually be more character bashing than just having one character making snide remarks, if that makes sense. One thing about bashing is it actually changes the character being bashed from canon (Like Harry finds proof Ginny has been using love potions on him and proof that Dumbledore hid his parent's will and proof that Molly was stealing money from him).

** Bashing is (obviously) OOC/Out of character. In 99.9% of stories that could be claimed as featuring bashing, authors add unrealistic, wild, and irrational traits/mannerisms/motivations to the character(s) being bashed.

For me, there's an unofficial scale for bashing, ranging from absolutely absurd and irrational, these characters are being made to be two dimensional/comically evil (10) to potentially possible behavior due to author slightly amplifying a character's negative traits (1).

You rarely see 1s, and almost all "bashing fics" are 8/9/10s on the scale.

Ask yourself: what are the character's motivations for hating the other? Are the foundations of their feelings solid and believable in the context of the story?

*** Seeing as my character is essentially the evil one it's most likely my own character that's being bashed. I mean, I haven't amplified anything, my own character just blows everything out of proportion. He's damn near insane and pulls at straws for various things. But as a reader, you don't see that it's false, you just see that my character believes it so. I fear that people'll think I'm majorly making someone who's famous and powerful incompetent and stupid. Having my character mutter about them being so grand is OOC for them. Bah.

**** I think that would work just fine. Just call it an AU and ignore anyone complaining about canon personalities. So long as there are reasons your character acts that way, it's fine. It's not fine if you make them ridiculous because you don't like that character at all. One of my favorite ongoing stories features an absolutely batshit fuckin insane/unhinged/unstable and rather powerful Harry. The story centers around his psychotic behavior and no one bats an eye because it is a clear AU. It's linkffn(Worthy of Magic by Sage Ra).

** Character Bashing is the hostile feelings that a fan expresses towards a character through writing. In said writing, they'll do everything they can to portray the character in a bad light, making them seem stupid, inept, and generally all around useless.

If a character hates another character and expresses that feeling, it's not bashing. Characters have their own personalities, and these personalities have feelings towards people attached to them. If a character hates another, they're most likely going to express that as often as they can.

If you want to write this correctly, prove that Dumbledore IS manipulative by showing his actions, and give other character's opinions of Dumbledore. As long as every other word out of your character's mouth isn't hate towards Dumbledore, you should be fine.

** Manipulative!Dumbledore doesn't necessarily mean evil!Dumbledore.

Think about the karate kid. Miyagi is clearly manipulative. He has ulterior motives. It goes to the point that when he's training Daniel-san, it doesn't even look like training. Would you call Miyagi evil?

The best mentors out there are very often manipulative. The classic old martial arts mentor from Hong-Kong is sadistic and manipulative but rarely evil.

** I wouldn't consider a character in the story expressing their feelings toward another character as "bashing". That is just a general aspect of life. Some people hate good people despite everything.

If you are worried people will take a character's vocal distaste for another character as bashing, simply have a second character disagree with the them to establish this is merely the character's view point and not a push from the author to make you hate the target.

Generally bashing is when the /writer/ takes an established character and grossly exaggerated flaws or creates dislikable aspects for the mere purpose of making the character appear inept/evil. It is changing a character so that others will hate them as much as the writer does.

** Bashing for the sake of bashing is wrong. Instead of calling him manipulative... Why don't you show him to be manipulative?

Readers aren't dumb because if your character wants to bash someone he should have reasons to back it.

What ever you do it should be well done and not some thing over the top.

And bashing isn't what bothers me that much it's he fact that I have read those exact same lines of bashing in 99 other fictions.

Good luck with your story.

** Hmm ... what is “character bashing”, you ask?

“Character bashing” is ascribing traits that the character does not have---by either exaggerating already existing traits, ascribing motives that are canonically untrue to their actions, or giving them new traits they did not originally have---without due reason in the story, in order to present them as worse than their original traits shown them to be.

One does have to note that both elements have to be present; if you do the former part (new or exaggerated traits or nonsensical motives) without the latter (so no presenting them worse) it will likely be a parody or even a satire, and if you do the latter part without the former part (so the character is worse, but the changes are ones that the original character could have conceivably gone through with the change in circumstances) then it is simply divergence in character development of (quite possibly) an AU story.

So, if you got a story with a “Greater Good” Dumbledore, then it's “character bashing” ... unless you rewrote---and did show it to your readers---his backstory and took out the elements that caused him to reject this ideology and instead made things happen that would have convinced him that it is a good thing, in which case it would simply be an alternate Dumbledore who went through a different set of circumstances and ended up being different.

With that in mind, “character bashing” is easiest to see in stories that allegedly follow canon up to a certain point and diverge then and at that given point a canon character that is being bashed starts behaving completely differently with no build-up to it and no actual reason for the change.
