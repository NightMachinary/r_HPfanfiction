Cho Chang : Red Lantern . Death Eaters beware


** That's terrifying.

More terrifying would be this taking place before Blackest Night and THEN having to deal with that after Voldemort.

... Or Voldemort getting a black Lantern Corps ring...

****** .... It's /fanfiction/. You don't need to be a purist to do a HP/DC crossover. If someone wants to say that Voldemort isn't fully human (especially after being given a body back from the homoculous in GoF), then a writer can do that.

********** True! And Cedric, and Sirius, and Remus and Tonks...

But IIRC, anyone who has previously died would be targeted by a black lantern ring, so... It would likely go after Dumbledore anyway then without recruiting due to the Black Hand? ðŸ¤”
