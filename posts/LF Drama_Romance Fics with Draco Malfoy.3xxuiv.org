I am quite a sucker for a Romance Fic, with some drama. I'm not picky, I am just happy if I can find some good new reads.


** Isolation is a really good Dramione fic. Rather long though.

*** Oooh. I like that one. There's something terribly erotic about how he's sexually attracted to her because she's a woman, but disgusted with himself because he's a bigot.

It's really rather bizarre, to be honest, but I like it because it doesn't sweep his bigotry, past or present, under the rug, like a lot of other Dramione fics tend to do.

  He can't leave the room. Her room. And it's all the Order's fault. Confined to a small space with only the Mudblood for company, something's going to give. Maybe his sanity. Maybe not. "There," she spat. "Now your Blood's filthy too!" DM/HG. PostHBP.

** My favorite is linkffn(The Malfoy Trial by Natida). Post DH, canon characterizations and features a Draco/Astoria romance and some excellent trial scenes.

  The trials for suspected Death Eaters involved in the Wizarding Wars have begun, and Draco Malfoy finds himself trying to hold together what is left of his family and his fortune, while struggling to escape the looming, almost inevitable future of a lifetime spent in Azkaban. But there is one person who might not have given up completely.
