Not in the same way that he "fears" Dumbledore, but more like "seeing Harry and running for his life". It may be just because of the prophecy or for another reason, although it would be better if Tom had a good reason, if there is a "good reason" to be terrified of a teenager.

#+begin_quote
  It is the greatest threat the world of magic has ever faced. It cannot be reasoned with. It cannot be bargained with. It cannot be hexed. It cannot be cursed. It cannot be stopped. It cannot be killed. And only Lord Voldemort stands in its way.

** That would be a good story: to the perenial question “Did Voldemort feel when a Horcrux was destroyed?” answer would be resounding “YES”, but for some reasons he couldn't do anything about (magically, he couldn't create new Horcrux, because he exhausted his quota, or something else). So, he is just waiting on his fate coming, falling deeper into madness with each Horcrux destroyed (because each part of his soul feeds into mind, when they are gone, he is going literally crazy). Beethoven's Fifth on steroids: Fate is comming. Could be good angsty story.
