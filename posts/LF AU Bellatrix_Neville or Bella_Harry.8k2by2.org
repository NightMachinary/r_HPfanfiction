However the AU Version is met, Bellatrix is a normal Woman and married with Neville (both have a Family or she is pregnant or they are about to make this happen). If not Neville, she is married with Harry.

The Fic doesnt have to contain this as a Main part, but if its a Fic that shows "alternate timelines", then it should take a acceptable Part of it


** Even in fanfics where Bella is "normal", would anyone comment on the age difference?

I recently discovered [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12877625/1/Through-the-Looking-Glass][Through the Looking Glass]] in which Harry travels to an alternate universe in the past, befriends then marries a pro-muggle Bellatrix, and adopts a girl version of himself. It's kind of funny but tends to fall into the edgy Harry territory

#+begin_quote
  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
