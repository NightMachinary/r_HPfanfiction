So you know how every harem fic gas women orgasming at the sight of him before he knocks them ou with his pure sexiness and cheesy pick up lines before marrying him alongside 69 other women because his hart is big because he was abused and will "love them all equally".

Can we get some bullshit on isle 69.

Also should I mark this post nsfw... naaa fuck that shit I'm not unsafe for work I have a job.

** Actually.. out of like.. 7-8 Harem fics I have read, all but 1 have a very normal Harry who ends up with a Harem basically not of his initial choice and not one of them remotely is like what you describe. My guess is you have been reading too much shitty quality smut Harem fics.

*** Here's an image for you to chew on: Male Veela are almost indistinguishable from female Veela. Their male reproductive organs are in glands in the tongue, making the act look like fellatio is performed on the female.

** I've never seen a non-slash Veela!Harry fic. Not that I have anything against slash, but I do have to say that other than /Desperate Measures by VVC/ which is recced above I tend to bypass Creature!Harry stories because I haven't seen any that are particularly interesting.

Same goes for Harem stories, I can't be bothered with them. I don't mind trio stories of any sort (my favourite unfinished story right now is Darkly Loyal with Harry/Draco/Hermione who get it on in all possible combinations), though of course the one I've read the most of is Lunar Harmony with absolutely no sexual contact between Luna and Hermione (rather prudish if you ask me).

But actual Harem stories, I can't be bothered with them. None of them truly explore the very real problems and pleasures of polyamory they all seem to be about straight male wish fulfillment. Harry, stumbles into marriage with half of the witches at Hogwarts and if Neville doesn't get the other half then Harry pretty much ends up with every witch who is named in the seven book canon, except Parkinson, Edgecombe and Umbridge. Bonus points if the women all get together and work it all out before springing it on Harry. What happens when the entire next generation of Hogwarts students all have the same father?

I suddenly just realised I need to read this story somebody please write it. The story of an entire generation of British witches and wizards who have to go abroad to find spouses (or I suppose they could marry muggles and muggle-borns) because everyone in Britain is a half-sibling.

  Exiled for three centuries on a barren rock, Harry's saved by the crew of the Enterprise D. He makes it to the colony world his people planned to go to and finds they're just as insular as ever though Hermione and his friends set them on a better course. Their nuclear option, though, left Harry with no escape. A prophecy is once again in play and he's the Chosen One. Again.

** You like interesting ideas, this fic has 'em: linkffn(desperate measures by vvc)

Lets see: - The Malfoys turn out to be the sympathetic side in the Weasley feud - Harry abandons Britain because he thinks the prophecy isn't about him (admittedly, different prophecy) - Moody is part of the prophecy. So is Hermione - Britain must be destroyed to be saved. And boy is it. - Pansy is actually an awesome friend - Neville is with a Slytherin

And to get people to read at least a little: Draco is half-eviscerated - by Harry - in the first few chapters. And even admits it was deserved.

  Harry may be a half-Veela, but there was no such thing as a destined mate. If somebody wanted him, they would have to prove their worthiness. And Draco's chances don't look so good when Harry guts him at the welcoming feast... HPDM, mpreg
