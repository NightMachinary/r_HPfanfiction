:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey all, I had a really good idea for a fic about a month ago. As I've been writing it, it's been almost too easy to plot, like I read before and am remembering it. Basically, I'm not sure if the premise is just really good, or if I'm an unoriginal hack. Below is the summary for my fic. Let me know if you've ever heard of something similar.

#+begin_quote
  The Tower of Merlin: seven floors of unspeakable danger. At the top? One wish, one desire, granted---no questions asked. Fleur wants to rewrite the stars. Harry wants to make Fleur his. And Voldemort? Voldemort lusts for the eldritch, a glowing talisman to plunge the world into darkness. What awaits them in the tower? The answer lies in only one direction... up.

** Sounds a lot like the manhwa/anime/webtoon "Tower of God."

** Someone's been watching Tower Of God! You could enquire over at [[/r/litrpg][r/litrpg]] because the whole 'dungeon crawl' concept is their bag.
