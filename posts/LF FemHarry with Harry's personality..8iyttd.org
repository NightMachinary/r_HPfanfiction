**** I wasn't recommending it. I was commenting on the fact you think the character isn't like a female Harry. I was wondering why you think they are different.

EDIT: OH. You linked to my fanfic.net version which I still haven't gone back to and edited or updated at all....I should really do that though, since FF.net is clearly where everyone gets reviews and views! :)

****** Yes! :) Also it was sort of the horribly long hard task of updating all the old and first draft type chapters and adding the new ones to it too, but that was actually super easy and quick because of the "COPY PASTE" feature in the document manager, which also retained all the formatting like italics, bolds, and paragraph structure. :)

** Linkao3(future's past by darkseraphina)

Though it's time travel to a pre-Marauder era for most of it, so you're not getting much of any other canon characters. She gets points for a unique pairing and timeline change event.

Anyway, her Ianthe definitely has temper, and sass, and a saving-people thing, and most of your other points.

  Her godfather is dead. So is Tom Riddle, which appears to be the only thing anyone else cares about. Oh, and getting ahold of her, her money, and her titles. Fuck that noise. Ianthe learned how to Maraud from the best, and she doesn't intend to take this lying down.She intends to change a single moment in time - and change the life of her godfather, herself, and the whole of Magical Britain. That the price for that change is all that she is, including her life? There's always a price.Merlin showing up and telling her that the price of her actions isn't her death? Not part of her calculations. Changing the past is surprisingly easy. Living it might just be harder. Especially when the lives she changed to save the future collide with the one she now lives, thirty years in the past.

** There's a fem!ron fanfiction on linkao3(weasley girl) that has been repeatedly noted as good ron characterization by readers.

For fem!harry, I'm not sure. Linkffn(iris potter and the goblet's surprise) is more sarcastic than average female harrys, but there are other issues with her characterization. I've heard good characterization things about linkao3(to reach without by inwardtransience) but the characterization might be weighed down by the author's prose.

*** Melantha(?) in To Reach Without is Harry's angst dialed up to 11.

Iris in Iris Potter and the Goblet's Surprise is Harry's sass dialed up to 11.

Tbh, even though Iris does meet many of the traits OP lists, she still feels like a completely different character. But I'm pretty sure the fic just embraces it instead of trying to pretend Iris is similar to Harry.

  AU: The first friend Harry Potter made on the Hogwarts express wasn't Ronald "Ron" Weasley; it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter of the Weasley clan. And all of a sudden, the future looked very different.Join the newly-formed "Potter's Gang" (consisting of Harry, Ronnie, Hermione and Neville) in their first year at Hogwarts as they get into all kinds of misadventures, and maybe have to face a certain Dark Lord before they're ready for it.First novel in the "Weasley Girl" trilogy. Fem!Ron, but not a romance, and not a canon rehash.

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else.

  She's been called many things --- sarcastic, inquisitive, often unapologetically so; quick-witted and resilient, and almost hopelessly reckless; young, small, but fierce and not easily controlled. Iris Potter doesn't do normal, and her fourth year at Hogwarts is evidence enough. New tasks.

  Peeves, though he was nasty about everything else--ickle firsties and orphan girls--got it immediately. For all six years of Harry's Hogwarts tenure, he dropped water balloons on the heads of anyone who misgendered her. Professor Binns never quite figured it out, but he didn't know any student's name. Nearly Headless Nick gallantly and somewhat awkwardly called her lady and tried to hold open doors for her, despite the fact that he couldn't open them. Snape called Harry "Mr. Potter" for all seven years that he was in Harry's life. Around year three, Ron stopped counting the detentions he got for his increasingly sarcastic responses to this.
