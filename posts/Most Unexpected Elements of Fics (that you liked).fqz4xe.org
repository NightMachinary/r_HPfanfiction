Pretty much what the title says. Can be anything... whether it's a particular concept (e.g. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12553337/1/D%C3%A9ja-Brew][Harry becomes a barista]]), an idea (e.g. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2970716/1/Into-the-Fold][Snape becomes a death eater in part because James Potter and Sirius Black were purebloods]]), a relationship (e.g. [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=306311][Ignotus Peverell/Dominique Weasley]]) or whatever. You can like the element but not the fic, like the fic but not the element or like both. No need for it to be a plot twist or anything... just something you'd never really thought about at all before you found yourself reading it.

I think that Ignotus/Dominique ship is the single most "what?" element I've come across. I actually really like that fic, incidentally.


** Draco working a normal job among muggles and Harry accidentally stumbles upon him.

It's not so unexpected anymore but I love reading fics where Harry doesn't become an auror, but he's also not some sad dude stuck in the daily grind. He's thriving doing whatever job the author gave him.

Snape/Hermione pairing was an unexpected thing I liked. However, I only enjoy it when it involves Snape de-aging or Hermione traveling back in time and staying there.

What, you're not into late 30's dudes in a position of power preying on teenage girls?

**** It's fine if Hermione is 20 and Snape is 40. Look at our world. There're couples with an even bigger age difference. Although I admit that it's really creepy when she's still at school. (That doesn't stop me though and I'll burn in hell)

***** Yeah, I've read ones where she's 25ish but what turns me off those is more of the fact that Hermione is usually sad and/or Ron is a bad dude. It also helps if I don't picture Alan Rickman as Snape. He was a great actor but definitely too old for FF purposes.

And hey, no judgement from me. We all have our things which others consider to be squicky. Like Snarry, which is always ew for me.

Mind-blowing. Do you remember any fics like this?

** Linkffn(Vault of Time).

I love the very competent manipulative Dumbledore. For instance (spoiler)Harry tries to appeal for emancipation, Dumbledore steps in and ruins that plan.(spoiler)

Harry keeps on trying to expose his manipulations but somehow Dumbledore keeps the wool over people's eyes. It's satisfying brilliant.

You can feel the struggle and pain that Harry has to face and endure to defeat both Dumbledore and Voldemort. I ended up rooting for this Harry to really win because for the first time in a long while of reading fanfiction, Harry Potter finally feels like an underdog, the same feeling I got reading canon.

Instead of the usual indie Harry that is just an excuse for badly written wish fulfillment.

  One tiny change makes all the difference in the world. When Harry discovers a small box in his vault during his first visit to Gringotts, he is hoping for a memento of his parents. Instead, his discovery starts him down a path of intrigue and suspicion. Not sure who he can trust, Harry will have to learn to rely on himself. Book 1 of The Cry of Freedom. Updates every Tuesday.

** [[http://siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=12033][Hermione the Quidditch Commentator. Things you didn't know you needed in life...]]

Fic's set in Harry's sixth year from Ginny's perspective. Some canon deviations... plot's about Ginny's trying to get over Harry. Comedy but not crack.
