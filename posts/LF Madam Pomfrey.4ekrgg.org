Hey guys, I'm looking for some fics that involve madam Pomfrey as a main character. I always thought she was a badass character, and I actually wrote up a detailed (33 page) character study for an HP RPG I used to do. But then I realized that I never read any fics that feature her!

Anyway I'm open to anything regarding relationship/no relationship. Just as long as she's the main character


** It's a one-shot but linkffn(The Assassin Wore White) is legit the most badass thing I've ever read

  In canon, healers and mediwitches were seemingly spared from the predations of the Death Eaters during both Blood Wars. St. Mungo's would have been a very soft target, but it stood inviolate. One patient was attacked, but the hospital and it's staff were spared. The question is, why? What could have kept mad killers in check? As with a great many other things, Poppy knew.

*** I'm not sure if I want to read it now, because the picture the title and summary paints for me is probably better than the story itself.

** I've had a plot bunny for ages about her in the ward with other people's stories going around her, seeing the characters grow and she's in the background a constant, almost an observer.

I've never managed to put it into words because I think it would work better as a video than a fanfic.

  Harry always suffered from the abuse of the Dursleys and nobody ever acted on it or even or noticed it. Thanks to a coincidence during the time after smugling Norbert out that changed. See what a small change can do.

** in one of Robst' stories she is Ginny's surrogate mom. Fairly substantial part, not main, but more than peripheral.
