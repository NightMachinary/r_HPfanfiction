Hi fairly long term lurker here I was just wondering if anyone ever wrote a fanfic that focused on albus and gellert from when they met back when they were teenagers (maybe even a bit before they met) and then slowly goes through their history. Highly highly highly preferable that it be over 100k words. The more words the better.


** This isn't exactly what you're looking for, but 35 Owls ([[http://letterblade.net/thirty-five_owls.html]]) is some damn fine writing and features correspondence that references their younger years together.

** There aren't any over 100k words. There are barely any over 10k words. But of all the stories set during the Two Months of Insanity, /Let Perpetual Light/ is by far the best. Has a fascinating Grindelwald who is charismatic and idealistic and unhinged, and an even more fascinating Ariana, who walks the line between this world and the next. linkao3(7213144).

#+begin_quote
  In the village of Godric's Hollow, the Dumbledore family is falling apart. Kendra Dumbledore is dead under mysterious circumstances, and Albus is the unwilling guardian to his wayward brother Aberforth, and Ariana, their mad sister in the attic. But everything changes with the arrival of Gellert Grindelwald, violently charming juvenile delinquent with an obsession for the fabled Deathly Hallows.

*** That's a shame, the one you linked was a great read. To be honest I'm surprised with well over a million fics made you'd think there'd be one good 100k+ fanfic about Albus/Gellert. Thanks anyway for that fanfic it was one of the better ones I've read.

** linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2428940/chapters/5375627]]) is not just about their younger years, but about their entire lives, it is not finished and gets updated regularly. I love how it is written, but it is definitely very unusual for fanfics and you have to prefer descriptions to action to like it, I guess.
