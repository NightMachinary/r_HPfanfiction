So is this fanfiction gonna get an update ? it's really a great ff , heck it's the best i ever read , so i'd really love to know if it's gonna get completed someday .


** Shit man, I'm sorry to say but the author was a real POS, he held the chapters hostage to make money on patreon. Plus it really went downhill in the latest updates.

*** Yeah, he essentially said that his time was more valuable than the story. I can understand being too busy to write, but its clear that if the only inspiration you can find to write is if you get paid. then you aren't going to have the same drive.

He basically got people to pay to read his story and then ditched it after the first payment. Really slimy.

**** See, I have no problem with authors using patreon. If people wanted to pay they could, hell I pay monthly on a RWBY writer. The thing that makes me mad is once you accept payment you have an obligation to fulfill your end of the bargain, and not doing so is super scummy to me.

The RWBY author I was talking about has 5 stories, and updates based on the patreon goal. About 5 months ago(or longer I can't remember) they hit a threshold and now updates one of those stories every week on sunday, and the other four update once every 2 weeks, on alternating Mondays or Fridays. They set a goal, people have paid it, and they deliver every single time without fail.

The author of Rent A Hero really upsets me, they set a goal, people paid, and then they stopped. If life got in the way then take down the patreon and put up a notice. If they died, well then that is outside their control and I apologize for the ill will.

***** The reason people object to charging for fanfiction is because you are making money off other people's work. Unless you have a legal agreement with the rights owner, that's immoral and illegal.

******* People do make money from other people's work constantly, but it's typically much more transformative content with a focus on the person who is producing it. For example, most people who play video games for Twitch or YouTube (a bit of an ongoing issue for Fair Use) would argue that the game is just a medium for their commentary, so the main focus is on them and thus transformative enough that it's fair use.

With regards to fan fiction - it's rarely legal, but many authors (including JKR) allow it. Authors (or other associated rights-holders) pretty much have the right (and some exercise it) to prevent any and all derivative works of fan fiction being published on any website. It's difficult to enforce, but ff.net would certainly be one of the first sites hit, and this is actually why it specifically doesn't allow you to publish anything based on stories by certain authors.

Apart from understanding of the rights-holders, one of the key aspects of fan fiction that has allowed it to flourish is that it's free. Monetisation is taken into account in fair use cases. Parody, satire and review are allowed, but, apart from that, you have to question if the story could stand by itself if you removed pretty much every aspect the original author created. For Harry Potter, this means characters, locations, spells, etc. The more you have to change, the less it's fair use. I'd argue the vast majority of stories on ff.net (including 0800-Rent-a-Hero) need to change pretty much everything, so shouldn't be monetised.

Might also be worth noting that smut and racism have specifically been banned by JKR, so you are breaking the law by including them. Which seems odd, given that one of the 'themes' of HP is the anti-muggleborn racism.

Morality is subjective, but I fail to see what is crazy about saying that making money off another's work is immoral.

TL;DR: fan fiction doesn't fall under fair use anyway (unless it's satirical), and exists solely because the rights-holders allow it, so monetisation just makes it even more illegal.

******** Again I'm not talking about the legality of the issue. Copywrite and intellectual property and everything else involved is convoluted and it comes from a time without internet. It doesn't make much sense and requires a law degree to debate. A great deal of things are in the legal grey area and fanfiction is certainly one of them.

What I commented on is how a fanfiction author asking for donations isn't immoral. Clearly it isn't. No one is being hurt, JK Rowling and Warner Bros and anyone else who owns Harry Potter isn't going to lose money because people contribute to a patreon. No one is being hurt, it is not immoral. The suggestion that it is so is completely insane.

This topic has come up on this sub before and I continue to be surprised at how people don't seem to want authors to make money from writing. There aren't enough readers to make much but even earning beer money is enough for people to justify time spent on a hobby which increases content. This is good for those writing and those reading.

********* I want authors to make money from writing, but I want it to be their own work. The vast majority of fan fiction is purely derivative and could not exist without the original work, so why should fan fiction authors be paid for it? JKR and Warner Bros would lose money. Legally, for a derivative work, they'd be owed royalties. Unless the fan fiction author has a legal agreement to pay the rights-holders 25% (the 'golden rule' figure for royalties according to KPMG) of any money made, the rights-holders are losing money. In accounting and legal terms, not getting money you're owed is equivalent to a loss.

There's also legal precedent for the fact that monetisation of fan fiction is illegal. JD Salinger successfully stopped publication of "60 Years Later: Coming Through the Rye" in 2009. "60 Years Later," as a fan fiction sequel to "Catcher in the Rye," was deemed to be copyright infringement by a US court of law

Besides, people shouldn't need money to justify a hobby. It should be done for enjoyment, or why would you ever do that activity in your free time? Why should they be paid money for one hobby to fund another?

Again, morality is subjective. Without even touching on whether or not it is immoral, I think it's "completely insane" that you can't see why someone would find taking money for an illegal activity to be immoral. The fact you'd completely disregard another's view, supported with sound logical reasoning, and go so far as to insult that perception, is baffling

****** I mean, morality can be argued, the Patreon is supposed to be a donation service to support things you like. If the fanfiction was pay to read that is a bit more damning, but the author is donated money and then the product is released to the general public.

Legally I am unsure, but I am pretty sure it's no more illegal then the rest of fanfiction, which to my knowledge is indeed illegal.

******* Legally, it is not actually legal but people simply don't out such behaviour because they want content and if those people got a Cease and Desist order and then got fined they'd probably stop.

It's a legally grey area if you are releasing stuff regardless and only do it more often if people pay you but don't promise anything of that ilk, as you may justify it with “well, lack of money means some of my free time goes towards additional work, so if I have money I have more time to write” which means that the people are technically paying you for the fact that you write and the content just happens to be whatever you are releasing. But when you only release stuff when paid (as was with that author; do note that the fee on Patreon is per chapter you are definitely paying for the work) it stops being a grey area as you are then basically selling that work which is not legal.

No this is contributing since it continues to be freely available regardless. It is also preferable to donate per chapter rather than monthly when its something so inconsistent as fanfiction.

You insinuated that getting money per chapter is somehow worse than getting a monthly contribution, I think it is infinitely better. That with no regard to the legality of the issue.

I looked at it. The goal was $50; the amount raised was $50. The day after the chapter was supposed to be published, the amount raised was less because (presumably) they were backing out because the agreement was breached (a chapter wasn't published).

** The greatest tragedy of this thread is that the OP thinks Rent-a-hero is a great fic. I could say "you must be new to fanfiction, OP", but I think there's a probability of "the OP has questionable taste when it comes to what constitutes good fiction". Fanfiction expertise isn't needed to determine that Rent-a-hero leans toward the shit-tier end of the spectrum.

Certainly, there may exist a version of reality where Rent-a-hero is a great piece of fiction. Such a world is likely a post-apocalyptic wasteland where all that's left of fiction is a copy of Rent-a-hero with nothing to measure it against and everyone who knew any other piece of fiction perished in the armageddon.
