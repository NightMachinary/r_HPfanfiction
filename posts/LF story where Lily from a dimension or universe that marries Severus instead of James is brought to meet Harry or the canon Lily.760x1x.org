Was literally thinking about this before I went to sleep and am interested in knowing if such a story exists.


** linkffn(What if? The Purgatory of Lily by Escoger) has canon Lily meeting different versions of herself in the afterlife, including ones where she's with Snape. Not vouching for quality though.

  Lily, after her death, gets the chance to see all of the mistakes she made in life, by viewing the lives of other Lilys who DIDN'T make her mistakes. Most pairings are SS/LE, but there are some JP/LP and others.

  Being the recipient of the Order of Merlin and also having his picture on the Chocolate Frog Cards was not a big feat for Healer Tom Riddle. As Head Healer at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, nothing much surprised him. Little did he know, his life was about to be turned upside down by the arrival of a bespectacled boy with messy hair through the Veil.
