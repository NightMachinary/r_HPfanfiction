I primarily read AU fanfics, and I tend to avoid Horcruxes, if only because a lot of the time it ends up returning to the canon hunt for the particular horcruxes - the diary, cup, diadem, ring, locket, the snake and Harry - which can't really be changed that much in terms of story.

I'm now onto the fifth book of my Slytherin!Harry series, The Serpent's Gaze, and I'm changing the Horcruxes element to something where Voldemort tethers himself to the Death Eaters that carry a Dark Mark instead - the idea being that [[/spoiler][the magic is easier and more stable than creating a Horcrux, and it means that Voldemort can cannibalize the energy from one of his servants in order to bring himself back when he's in a much depleted state. He did this with Nagini initially, leaving him with very directly snake-like features, and then with Lucius Malfoy and Karkaroff; effectively, he uses their magic and lifeforce to replenish himself, which means that he has an easy use for traitors while being able to utilize his true followers as tethers to life itself.]]

I have Voldemort like, examine Horcruxes, but basically go with the idea that after creating the diary, he moved away from using them and instead worked to try to stabilize the magic and use it in a different way, as I wanted to have a completely different set of ambitions and a different pay-off at the end of the "hunt", as it were. Every single Death Eater /has/ to die, which is quite different than needing to hunt down some cursed objects.

I've seen different versions of immortality, though - ones where Voldemort has had to make like, actual sacrifices and taken boons from demons or spirits, ones where Voldemort goes kind of snake-like and actually eats people to rack up "years", as it were...

What are your favourite alternatives to the Horcrux, or different ideas of Horcruxes you've seen? Do you think it's worth changing in AUs, or do you think the same Horcruxes can be done well?


** I haven't read any good horcrux alternatives yet. but the idea of using the dark marks like that is similar to orochimaru and the curse marks of his followers in naruto

** I had one where Tom Riddle creates reliquaries into which he can move his soul. If his soul is in his body when he's killed, he's dead. If it's in a reliquary when the reliquary is destroyed, he's dead. But he can move his soul between bodies and reliquaries, providing a smaller measure of durability against death than a horcrux. The benefit is that he isn't burning his brains to extend his life (as personal experience with his first horcrux, as examined under the influence of the Diadem of Ravenclaw, showed).

** One Horcrux idea I like is pretty much the idea you've mentioned, actually -- in linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11572455/1/If-Looks-Could-Kill]]), If Looks Could Kill, he's made all of his marked Death Eaters a horcrux.

  ONE-SHOT: After Arthur Weasley nearly dies at the Ministry, Harry wonders why Voldemort's snake isn't something more exotic...really, no self-respecting Parseltongue should limit himself to something as mundane as a regular snake. In which Harry makes use of what he learned in Care of Magical Creatures, Kreacher is forced to cooperate, and the Chamber hides a new Secret..

  The pride of a Slytherin is in his resource and cunning, and in the serpent's discerning gaze. Slytherin!Harry, platonic H&Hr duo, assorted ships. No Lord Potter, no creature inheritance, no OP!Harry - AU plots (no Riddle diary, no Department of Mysteries, alternate prophecies, no Horcruxes). Character-focused and plot-heavy. Cross-posted (with extra content) to Ao3.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** I actually liked the Horcruxes from HPMoR - Voldemort has [[#s][perfected the Horcrux ritual. Each one binds his soul the living, but doesn't require him to split the soul. So he's got thousands of them around, some hidden very well. He even put one on the Voyager before it launched.]]. It basically made it so Voldemort actually /cannot/ be killed. Gotta find another way to deal with him.

I also think the Dark Mark is pretty great. One of the things it does is puts some more reasoning behind putting permanent obvious marks that can't really be hidden on your followers.
