:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a specific fic that I'm pretty sure was on FF.net, where Draco was sent to Durmstrang instead of Hogwarts and went through his schooling there. It was a one-shot, more character-driven than anything else (i.e. it didn't really cover Draco/the Malfoy's being affected by Voldemort's return, just focused on Draco & how the change of setting affected him), and had him and Viktor Krum being friends - which in itself was a whole thing, because there was a thread running through it about gaining/earning a "brother" in other students trhough dueling and winning their respect. It's driving me absolutely /bonkers/ because I have gone through all my bookmarks and can't find it, so any help you guys can give me would be deeply appreciated. Thanks!! :)
