I saw someone requesting good Snape fics and I was about to recommend this - but realized that coffeeonthepatio seems to have deleted their works on ffn...

I /loved/ that fic - I've provably read it a good 10 or 15 times. Does anyone have a copy, or know where it might still be up?

Really hope that everything is good with the coffeeonthepatio - such a talented writer!

Also - apologies if Request is the wrong tag - wasn't sure what to use.


** You are lucky. Coffeeonthepatio start reposting her fic today [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13662897/1/From-the-Corner]]

There's the first chapter. Looks like it didn't archive any of the others.

**** She used to have it on her ffnet profile and her livejournal page so I think it's fine! It's not her personal email, just her fanfiction email she used for communicating about FF. :)
