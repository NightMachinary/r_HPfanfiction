I'm writing a fic where the MC is in Hufflepuff. I've given Helga Hufflepuff an axe and put it over the fireplace, I've added potentially-man-eating-ivy, and I'm out of ideas. I want stories/ideas where Hufflepuffs are unassuming but secretly terrifying.

Do you have any scary!Hufflepuff (or just generally Hufflepuff) headcanons?


** Helga's true fame is (mostly) lost to history. Her reputation for teaching the leftovers comes from the fact that she was teaching in retirement from a career that made a /lot/ of enemies so she didn't dare advertise her presence, and the fact that Hogwarts is fortified to this day is part of her legacy as a founder.

Y'see, of the four founders, she was the one who was unarguably a Dark Witch by modern standards. Helga of the Rheintal (lower Rhine, 'of valley broad' as the hat sings it) was also known as Black Helga, the most terrifying mercenary sorceress of late 9th/early 10th century Europe. She carved her name in blood, fire and fell sorceries from the low countries to the shores of the Black Sea, only learning the value of loyalty to anything other than coin in her later career, when she stopped taking contracts from the invading Magyars. From that point on - shortly before the Battle of Lechfeld, after which the Magyar knew only reverses - the blood she shed mortared the foundations of the Holy Roman Empire.

Her legacy persists in Hogwarts' massive financial endowment. Helga spent the pillage of half a continent on land whose rents still fund the school she helped found - the ministry subsidy is still only nominal even by the 20th century, even after the whopping 'honoraria' the school Governors take.

Every newly sorted Hufflepuff is taken aside and quietly instructed that the high standard of courtesy and fair play expected of every Hufflepuff is part of their centuries-long atonement for their Founder's dark deeds.

** Well, you could write them a bit "uncanny valley" where they would be unnaturally coordinated, (WE ARE THE LEGION), you could write a few scenes where a Hufflepuff needs a thing and then they suddenly have the thing because they know a guy who knows a guy, who knows a guy.... You could play them as a Cosa Nostra type organization...

Or you could write them as the 'normal people'... Who somehow manage to be completely unmoved by the insanity of the world around them, an immovable object. No special quirks, just trucking on.... Regrdless of what's happening, because everything is all right in the Hufflepuff Zone.

** The thing about Hufflepuffs is... they should be scary. Close knit and hard working in a magical world were if you work hard you can become deadly. No one fights harder than for their loved ones. Slytherins would weigh cost and risk against personal benefit, Ravenclaws hide behind their books, Griffindors seek glory impulsively (if they have an audience). But Hufflepuffs will die for their friends. And they are united and disciplined. So yeah...

*** You hurt one of them and since they're all probably friends the others will come for you. Yeah they're definitely kinda scary.

** One series I read pointed out that Helga Hufflepuff was a Viking. You can extrapolate from there.

There's also the very fun The Price Is Right by Hi Pot in Noose (sequel unfinished but recently got another chapter), in which Harry finds the forgotten Hufflepuff obstacle course that includes such things as swinging over a lake of piranhas and decides they want people to underestimate them. In this fic it's played for laughs but you can make it serious. linkffn(9894129) [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1070691][Also on AO3]].

  Point of deviation: Harry's primary school taught Home Economics. Harry's not going to let the wonders of magic take away his common sense, and if he can get a good deal, he's going to take it. Meanwhile, money is fun, but magic is funner. AU

** So Helga was a viking... whose animagus form was a badger... a relative of the wolverine, the most vicious animal known. How about just having her take a pounding and then get up bloodied and utterly devastate her attackers, taunting them all the while. Like Tyler Durden in Fight Club. Gets cut up and blood everywhere and then the real fun starts.

** I've read a few fics where the majority of aurors and dept heads at the Ministry were Hufflepuffs. With Slytherins too busy plotting, the Hufflepuffs just keep showing up to do good work and reap the rewards. Plus all the loyalty of Hufflepuff outdoes the cronyism of Slytherin.
