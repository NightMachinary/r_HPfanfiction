I'd like to read a quick one-shot where Harry travels back in time, accomplishing an amazing bit of magic, only to immediately get hit by a bus and be killed.

What idea or prompt have you wished to see written out?


** I think this fandom could definitely do with more 'time-travel to the far future' stories, since plotlines set in the popular past eras are extremely common already.

I'd enjoy reading a story in which a canon character travels to the future where humanity as a whole struggles against an existential threat on a scale much worse than Voldemort's power grabs. That would force the character to accept a new perspective on what things are truly important, and if/when they make it back to the past he/she might prioritize preparing humanity for the future threat, even if it means making choices of cruel moral calculus.

*** Time travel to the future rarely works well since knowledge of the future usually leads to very bad choices if you aren't part of that future. Zipang is a good example of this.

**** Then make it so that the MC doesn't go back. I never like stories where the main character goes somewhere amazing, and has tons of character development, but then goes back to their boring life. Even worse is when the character forgets about it. For example, Five Kingdoms. The entirety of the story is the main character finding his powers, then at the end of the series, he goes home, loses his powers, and forgets the entire storyline. That's one of the worst endings to a book that I have ever read.

** Unusual characters getting do-overs is always sure to get my interest. Such as:

- From the graveyard confrontation, Cedric's shade is somehow pulled back in time by the malfunctioning /Priori Incantatem/ effect and is returned to his body at the start of the Tournament. (An interesting in exercise in how /little/ foreknowledge we might give a character and still watch the sparks fly: our time-traveling Cedric has no idea what was /actually/ going in the Graveyard, only that /something/ happened with a cup, /someone/ cast a Killing Curse at him, and Harry had /somehow/ "been there before in a dream").
- Peter Pettigrew is sent back to the Marauders era: armed with the knowledge of how his life turns out if he joins the Death Eaters out of fear, will he find it within himself not to repeat his past mistakes? Beyond that, will he ever dare to use his foreknowledge for higher purposes, despite the fear of exposure?
- Hagrid do-over. He's jolted from the funeral of Aragog back into his teenage body just before the murder of Moaning Myrtle.
- Speaking of which, /Aragog/ do-over. After his death, Aragog finds himself back beneath Hagrid's bed in his room at Hogwarts, /just/ before Riddle bursts in to frame him and Hagrid. (Bonus points for Aragog turning out to be the real chosen one, since he too, remember, was cursed in the face by Riddle and lived... We don't actually know when he was hatched, either, do we?)
- Fred Weasley returns to his, or Harry's, first year after his death. There's no hiding the change from his twin... who's now a completely different mental age from him. What can two expert pranksters do to help? And how does their relationship even work now, on an emotional level?
- Hedwig. When Harry buys her in /Philosopher's Stone/, she knows perfectly well how it all goes, though only in her slightly skewed, nonhuman type of way. How can a mere owl, whose language no one /could/ understand even if she wanted to share her future knowledge, manipulate events?

This has good potential as a deconstruction of a fix it fic. You could totally play with tropes with this.

** Started writing this a while back. Still think of it now and then.

#+begin_quote
  /A red glow burst across the enchanted sky above them as the dazzling sun appeared over the sill of the nearest window. The light hit both of their faces at the same time, so that Voldemort's was suddenly a flaming blur. His high voice rang out, just as Harry yelled his best hope to the heavens, pointing Draco's wand:/

  /“Avada Kedavra!”/

  /“Expelliarmus!”/

  /The bang was like a cannon blast, and the golden flames that erupted between them, at the dead center of the circle they had been treading, marked the point where the spells collided. Voldemort's green jet met Harry's spell; the Elder Wand flew high, dark against the sunrise, spinning through the air toward the master it would not kill, who had come to take full possession of it at last. And Harry, with the unerring skill of the Seeker, caught the wand in his free hand as Voldemort fell backward, arms splayed, the slit pupils of the scarlet eyes rolling upward./

  Pain.

  For an eternal, infinitesimal moment, pain was all Voldemort knew. He could not think. He could not perceive. The passage of time was lost to him. The pain was all he was, the one proof of his continued existence, without which he might have simply ceased to be.

  Voldemort was no stranger to pain. He had survived thirteen years as the meanest spirit, every second of it an unending torment. He had persevered and overcome it. After all, pain was far preferable to the alternative: death, that which he feared above all else, the great equaliser whose inevitability rendered all deeds meaningless.

  And so Voldemort clung to the pain. He could not do so consciously, but some part of his tattered soul endured. Few other beings could have done it. Voldemort's broken soul drifted without direction through space and time, loosened from the constraints of earthly existence; he was strong enough to hold himself together through sheer force of will, yet too weak, and too fearful, to move on.

  After an age of the universe had passed, something changed. It should not have done so. He should have remained in that place of pain forever, stuck in an unending limbo which would outlast the end of time itself. But no man had ever gone as far as he in pushing back the boundaries of death. No being had ever anchored themselves to life as securely as had Lord Voldemort.

  Even against the flow of time, his horcruxes called to him. Like a planet around a star, his soul began to orbit a point in his own lifeline, the position not of greatest power but of highest stability, when his essence had existed in three places at once. That oasis of stability reeled him in, and his soul --- for all its weakness, still the master of its shards --- inexorably returned to time and space. There, it latched onto its counterpart and, being of the same essence, the two merged.

  --------------

  Lord Voldemort opened his eyes.

  He was lying in a four-poster bed. The curtains were pulled closed around him and he was shrouded in darkness. The last thing he remembered was confronting the Potter boy in Hogwarts' Great Hall. And then... yes, then he had died.

  A lesser man might have panicked at that point. They would have jerked awake with a gasp of air, jumping out of bed and calling for help. But Voldemort was not that type of man. He remained still in the bed, his keen mind racing. Clearly, he thought with deep satisfaction, his death had not become a chronic condition. Once more he had escaped death's embrace; once more he had proven himself more than just a wizard. But the question remained: where was he?

  Was he a captive of the Order of the Phoenix, or even the Ministry of Magic? That seemed unlikely. He was not bound in any fashion, and the bed was far too comfortable to have been provided by his enemies. Moreover, he sincerely doubted that either of those two organisations would be foolish enough to believe they could hold him. No, if he had been captured, then surely his captor would have finished him before he woke.

  If he was not held by an enemy, then the logical conclusion was that an ally had retrieved and revived him. And yet this seemed equally unlikely. When he had fallen, he was surrounded by his foes. Who among his followers could have stolen his body away from under Potter's nose? Severus was dead by his own hand, and apparently a traitor besides; Lucius had abandoned their cause; and Bellatrix, his last, best lieutenant, had been killed during the battle, by the Prewett woman no less. Even if by some miracle one of his Death Eaters had retrieved his body, what method could they have used to revive him? His horcruxes were gone.

  It was with cold dread that Voldemort realised he should be dead. He did not understand how it was that he still lived, which meant that he had survived by luck alone.

  He abhorred luck.

  The only way forward was to investigate. Cautiously, he reached out to pull back the bed's drapes, but as he did so he froze. He was wearing pinstripe pyjamas. And even in the darkness, he could see that his hands were different. They were no longer skeletal, and his nails no longer sharpened to a point. In short, they looked like normal human hands.

  Something was very wrong. He opened the drapes and immediately recognised his location: he was in Hogwarts, within the Slytherin dorms. Four other beds were arranged around the circular room, and in the silence Voldemort could hear the sound of breathing from beyond their curtains.

  Most importantly, there was no one guarding him.

  He slipped out of bed and stood, his eyes falling on the nearby cabinet. He couldn't believe it. There, resting next to an alarm clock, was his wand. It was unmistakably his: he would recognise the light brown yew and simple, cylindrical construction anywhere.

  He picked it up, smiling as he felt its warmth greet him. No matter where he was, or who had put him there, with a wand in his hand there were few who could stand against him. He moved with growing confidence to the brightly lit bathroom, where he paused in front of the mirror.

  “Impossible,” he whispered, and yet he could not deny the evidence of his eyes. It was not Voldemort staring back at him, but Tom Riddle. He was as tall as ever, but more handsome than he recalled. His eyes were no longer red but a dark brown; his skin was pale but healthily so; and he possessed a full head of thick, black hair.

  He stayed there, staring into the mirror for longer than he would like to admit. While some part of him missed the strength and elegance of his horcrux-transformed body, he was unexpectedly captivated by this image of his younger self, so casually sacrificed on the path to greater immortality. He turned his face one way and the other, feeling it with his hands. By all appearances he had been transported to the body of his teenage self.

  There was only one magic which could perform such a transformation: the magic of time. Though he had studied it extensively, Voldemort had always avoided the practice of such magic. Not even he was arrogant enough to think that he could meddle with time and escape unscathed. And yet here he was, looking out from the eyes of his younger body.

  His first priority was to establish the nature of the time magic which had been invoked. Was it only his body that had changed, or had he truly travelled through time? There was a simple answer to that question.

*** Pt. 2

#+begin_quote
  He strode back into the dorm, approached one of the beds, and thrust the curtains open. The bed's occupant was fast asleep, but his face was unmistakably that of a young Cyrille Lestrange, one of Voldemort's first Death Eaters.

  Or rather, Voldemort corrected himself, the Knights of Walpurgis. He had not renamed the group until years after his departure from Hogwarts. Looking down at Lestrange's face, he was forced to bury a laugh threatening to escape him. Somehow, he had travelled back in time, his soul landing in the body of his younger self.

  The next question was /when/. Unless he stumbled across a newspaper, that was a slightly harder question to answer. He let the curtain to Lestrange's bed fall back into place and strode towards the large porthole looking out into the depths of the lake. During the day it would let a greenish light into the room, but at night the lake was pitch black.

  /“Open,”/ Voldemort hissed in parseltongue, and he reached forward, his hand passing through the glass like the barrier to Platform Nine and Three Quarters. He had created this cubby hole in his fourth year, a portal into a pocket of space in which he could hide his research into the Chamber of Secrets. It had continued to be useful since, and sure enough when he withdrew his hand, it was holding a leather-bound diary and a ring.

  “Interesting,” Voldemort muttered, examining the items closely. As expected, the diary was already a horcrux: he had made it during his sixth year, using Myrtle's death from the year before to splinter off a fragment of his soul. The ring, however... that was a surprise. While it was not yet cursed, it was undoubtedly one of his horcruxes. He had not used his Muggle father's death to create the horcrux in the ring until his last week of Hogwarts. Clearly, he was to graduate very soon.

  Once more he was forced to suppress a laugh, a jubilant mood taking him. This was perfect. The opportunities he had! The mistakes he could correct! He returned the horcruxes to their hiding place, plans unfolding in his mind as he retreated to his own bed.

  The timing suited him well. While he would have enjoyed more time to explore the many secrets that Hogwarts' held, his status as a student would limit his freedom. No, it would be better to escape the constraints of childhood, as well as the ever-watchful eye of Albus Dumbledore.

  The thought of Dumbledore was enough, very briefly, to dampen his mood. For decades Dumbledore had been the thorn in his side, and he had enjoyed the unparalleled freedom brought about by the older wizard's death. Without Dumbledore to oppose him, he had been able to take the Ministry within a matter of months.

  Now he was back to square one. Not only was Dumbledore still alive, he would be at the height of his influence, having just defeated Grindelwald in a spectacular duel. Worse, Voldemort was forced to recognise that the Ministry in this time was a very different beast to that of the Nineties. It had taken decades to weaken the Ministry to the point where he could take it over with such ease.

  In this time, many of the wizards he had killed in his path to power still lived... the Head Auror, Theseus Scamander, was a particular concern, as was the Head of the Department for International Magical Cooperation, Marlene McKinnon. Not to mention that Bartemius Crouch, Edgar and Amelia Bones would have all joined the Ministry by now, junior in position but formidable nonetheless. While Voldemort knew that he could defeat any one of them in a duel --- he had done it before, after all --- he was not so powerful that he could take them all at once.

  Nonetheless, he was confident that he could do things much more effectively this time around. How could he not, with the advantage of all his knowledge of the future? He had been so close, the first time... all he had to do was avoid certain mistakes.

  For one thing, he would immediately stop making horcruxes. Two were clearly sufficient to guarantee his immortality, and making more posed a serious risk: the more he made, the more clues he left, clues which Dumbledore had apparently followed. This time he would be more discreet. He would also avoid the obvious error of trusting his Death Eaters with any of them... Bellatrix had failed to protect the Cup, Lucius had deliberately given away the Diary, and the locket had been lost to an overly curious Regulus Black. Three horcruxes destroyed because of traitorous or incompetent followers.

  Another priority was to wipe out the Potter family before James Potter was even born. Yes, he would particularly enjoy that task... they would have no way to know he was coming, being his first wizarding victims... he would descend on their family home in the Cotswolds and lay waste to the whole area; not a single blade of glass would survive his wrath, and the world would never know the cursed name of “Harry Potter”.

  Voldemort paused, the thought of the boy cutting short his train of thought, a flash of bone-deep pain jolting through his soul's memory. The Potter boy had defeated him. He could not avoid that fact now.

  Over the years, he had considered many reasons for his continued failure to kill Harry Potter. His own poor luck had been his first explanation: Lily Potter's sacrifice was a known Counter-Charm, but the conditions for its invocation were so rare that it was the stuff of legend rather than everyday magical reality. In his moment of victory he had not recognised the danger, but who could blame him? And as for the brother wand effect, there was no way Voldemort could have predicted that. One did not expect the magic of fairy tales to rear its head in the real world.

  But then, when the boy continued to evade him, he was forced to admit --- not only to himself, but to his Death Eaters as well --- that his own carelessness had played a part. Yes, the brother wand effect was unforeseeable, but had it not been he who handed Potter his wand? And hadn't curiosity overcome him, when he watched Potter confront Bellatrix in the Ministry of Magic? He could have intervened and killed the boy at any moment, but he had delayed and lost his chance to the arrival of Dumbledore.

  Poor luck and his own errors had seemed an adequate explanation, until Harry Potter had somehow survived the Killing Curse once more, before proceeding to turn his own Killing Curse back on him.

  Voldemort did not understand how Potter had done either.

  /"If it is not love that will save you this time,"/ he had said, /"you must believe that you have magic that I do not, or else a weapon more powerful than mine?"/

  What was it that Potter had said in response?

  /"I believe both.”/

  Voldemort had laughed in his face. But now, having been defeated by Potter yet again, having survived only through luck himself, he was forced to take the boy's words seriously. The fact was that Potter understood magic which he did not; powerful, arcane magic of a kind that had no business interfering with the daily lives of wizards; the kind of magic which was supposed to only exist in myth, and yet seemed to occur with disconcerting regularity to ruin Voldemort's best laid plans.

  It all came back to that prophecy. He had never heard the second half of it, and there was no chance of him discovering its contents now, decades before it had been uttered. Yet without it, Voldemort felt like he was missing a vital piece of knowledge. Even armed with the advantages of time-travel, he was concerned that events would continue to conspire against him in ways that he could not predict. If he went to the Potter family home to kill them, would he once more inadvertently bring about his own downfall, decades earlier than in the first timeline?

  For the first time in his life, Voldemort was uncertain. It was that troubling uncertainty which dominated his mind as he drifted back to sleep, for once having no clear plan for the day which would follow.

  Breakfast was a surreal experience.

**** :o That is so good I love your Voldemort voice and him actually being forced to humble himself after Deathly Hallows Harry inexplicable magic bullshit killed him again! :) I like a villain who can admit and learn from mistakes! It might have taken a lot, but Voldemort finally got forced to do so himself! :) Also I love how canon compliant it is; I was actually half expecting some monologue about "Horcruxes made me lose my sanity!!" in that part about his Horcruxes, but nope, he only talked about canon trusting bellatrix, lucius, and regulus with the horcruxes! :)

We also have a handful of Harry goes back in time to rescue himself from his abusive relatives.

​

What I'd like to see is this: psychopathic Tom Riddle or Tom Riddle with alexithymia (but not criminal Tom Riddle), trying to raise himself. Young Tom should be completely oblivious to the fact. A lot of sons look the same as their parents. A lot of sons are named after their fathers. It's completely normal, yeah?

** Harry is hit by a stray spell during the Hogwarts raid and the next thing he knows, other than a colossal headache, is a warm, soft body snuggled into his side. Turns out, he is in spring 1977 and the person next to him is no other than Lily Evans, who has the same hangover as him and is very glad that the stranger who looks like James Potter is in fact not James Potter. She just had a fight with her sister and the last thing she wants to deal with is that git. Meanwhile, Harry has a nervous breakdown and Lily coaxes the whole truth out of him.

It would be very interesting to see how they would choose to proceed because Harry has incomplete information (Snape as a traitor) and Lily would be pretty terrified by the fact that she has 4 years. With Harry's experience, pretty much any avenue you usually see in TT would be closed. Dumbledore was just proven incompetent, McG didn't have her big moment yet and is therefore stuck at "don't antagonise Umbridge", Snape is a traitor and half of the Order members Harry knows are too young. The only logical options would be Moody (who might not believe them) or Slughorn (kinda trustworthy, he likes Lily).

Of course, this only works if you do NOT make it about the incest kink. If at all necessary, play it off with humour but I honestly don't think that it would be a big issue beyond procreation (adoption is the easy out here). To Lily, Harry would be a less idiotic version of James and nothing beyond that. She has absolutely 0 familiar attachment to him. Harry has exactly one memory of what the Lily from his timeline did, but he would quickly discover that the 1977 version is very different to what he has been told about her.

** I'd love to see one where Hermione just keeps her time turner and uses it in the plots of the following years, while constantly trying to avoid paradoxes.

Death Eater attack at the world cup? Immediately turn back and prepare a nasty trap for them that triggers just in time to save her friends just after she disappeared into the past.

Harry needs extra time training for the tournament? Cheat a few extra hours into each day.

Want to watch the second task while also participating? No problem for the girl who can be in two places at once.

Harry kidnapped to the graveyard? Not much she can do here, but fake Moody gets captured an hour before Harry returns.

Harry just got attacked by Dementors? Borrow his invisibility cloak, take a camera, turn back, and snap a picture of them as evidence.

Arthur got attacked by a snake? Turn back, alert Dumbledore a few hours before it happened, and let the him reach the Ministry just in time to save Arthur and capture the snake.

Sirius is in the Ministry? Okay, this one can get really interesting. Hermione and Harry deal with Umbridge and turns back afterwards, alert the DA and get going while Umbridge is busy with past-Harry and past-Hermione. Fly to Hogsmeade and floo to London. While in the Time room, grab a bunch of extra time turners and get the entire DA back to before Harry got the vision. Attack the Death Eaters long before they expect visitors. And then the Order arrives early too because after the entire battle was over Hermione turned back even further and alerted them. Results in most Death Eaters captured and Voldemort set back a lot.

Now sixth year just means that after Katie almost died they turn back and see Draco imperius her. Draco caught, sixth year plot over. Extra time for training and prepping.

The Horcrux hunt in the sea cave goes a little better thanks to time travel, and they find the locket in Grimmauld no problem.

Seventh year the trio gets a whole lot of more stuff done while on the run and uses time travel all the time. Gringotts heist? Yeah, got the Horcrux in the vault an hour before we entered the building, and we left an hour before that.

Meanwhile in Hogwarts the DA uses their tuners they smuggled out of the Ministry in year 5 to wreak havoc on the Death Eaters.

*** Let me start by saying I love the idea of Hermione deciding (and being allowed, insert puppy dog eyes "but I would /never/ abuse it" pleading to McGonagall) to keep the time turner after third year.

That said, a lot of your proposed situations seem to violate the main rule of time turners as established in PoA and ignoring Cursed Child: You can't change the past, only create closed time loops. So it wouldn't be as simple as "Hermione goes back in time a few hours to fix things" -- the original situation that prompts her to go back in the first place must itself be compliant with whatever she does once she uses the time turner.

You'd probably need a diagram to plot it all out now that I think about it.

E.g. maybe he befriends Tom Riddle and thinks he can save him, only to be used by Tom, and then just killed with a "thanks for the heads up about the future!"

Or maybe Harry does kill Tome Riddle and when he returns to the future he finds that entire wizarding world has been destroyed. Tom Riddle somehow prevented something far worse from occurring ...

Zombies is a great encapsulation of 'bad things happen when mucking with time'. It is a trainwreck you are watching get more and more complicated.

The only one I know that came close was the time loop hermione one, where Hogwarts is stuck in a time loop till reality wears out and starts to fade. But that one is more tragedy/depressing than 'fools who mess with time end up being made into a time pretzel'...

** There's so many linchpins you can kill in the story and get a vastly different outcome.

If you had an hour in the past and the knowledge of where the person is, you can vastly change history for the better.

- Snape: Voldemort doesn't get the prophecy.
- Dumbledore: Prophecy may or may not happen somewhere else.
- Trelawney: No more prophecy. Or the prophecy gets recited somewhere else.
- Pettigrew: No more traitor.

Hell, you don't even have to kill said people. Only drug them, burn down the hogshead, render them unconscious, kidnap them, etc. Maybe send a "truthbomb" letter to a few important people. while you are there.

Then after the prophecy event is averted (and the letters arrived to their recipients), the time traveler poofs out of existence. The rest of the fic can be how history plays out after the fact. The new main character can be ANYONE.

1. A oneshot or otherwise short fic where no matter how hard the time traveler(s) try to change the past things rearange themselves so that small details here and there are different, but the big picture things end up the same.

2. Time traveler(s) go back in time intending to change things with future knowledge and at first it works but every change they make results in changes they couldn't anticipate to the point that they don't have knowledge of future events anymore and have to deal with the challenges a totally different timeline presents. The only benifit they keep from their past experinces/future knowledge is that they're more skilled and more mature when they're younger this time around.

And then I'd do a Black Comedy, and have Neville be a secret vigilante, then he has to reveal himself to protect his secret so he takes the fall for crimes he did not commit as Tom Riddle (Voldemort makes a plot to frame Neville for the crimes he committed by paying old friends, and changing pictures at the Ministry to future Neville's)

Then Neville would have to work with Bellatrix to break out of prison, and Neville really learns what it is to be a hero and travels to final Hogwarts battle and helps with it!
