It is a Manipulative!Dumbledore story so Harry considers only Dumbledore as his worst enemy.

** Well.. interesting idea, but god damn do they can to change up a lot of things or make Harry completely different, because he basically has to forgive Voldemort for murdering his parents.

PS. Wasn't it basically stated that ANY enemy would do? Not just a 'true enemy'. Basically for this to work, Harry has to be neutral towards Voldemort at best. He can literally not see him as anything near an enemy or antagonist.

*** IDK, I think it requires a true enemy because it is a ritual, and Harry's blood being taken before the cauldron is important as well.

Otherwise you could just nick someone's blood and have Voldemort resurrected quickly.

**** Voldemort tackled that in GOF. Pettigrew wanted to use any other wizard's blood since Voldemort has a lot of enemies (and vice versa) and Harry was considered well-protected. But Voldemort wanted Harry specifically because his blood would make him more powerful. So, any enemy would do. It doesn't have to be a "true enemy."

***** Maybe just have it that after year 2 Harry believe that voldemort was set up by Dumbledore. He could find that Dumbledore knew about the chamber and let hagrid take the fall. Dumbledore had 10 years to figure out harry was a Horacrux and year 2 confirmed it.

Maybe have Harry learn about the prophecy. I don't think it directly states Voldemort as the dark lord. Marked as equal could be Harry being the boy who lived and the only other "defeater" of a Dark Lord.

*** You can not like someone and not call them an enemy. To me an enemy is someone who is or represents something so deeply opposed to your beliefs that there can be no reconciliation between you two and who also has the ability to act on those differences. If either party wins the other loses. You could make Voldemort a non-enemy a few different ways. Firstly by widening the power gap in Harry's favor so much that he becomes a nonissue like what is done in a plethora of crack fics, they turn Voldemort into a joke instead of an enemy. Secondly you could alter the goals of either party enough so that they don't clash as much, for example changing Voldemort to be less violent and more political and taking away the prophecy. These changes would make him less obviously morally reprehensible and less likely to directly affect Harry's life. An alternate example would be to have Harry more closely aligned to Voldemort's goals, either by making him an outright ally or by making him an ambivalent third party or any number of other ways. You would probably have to get rid of the prophecy factor in some way for any of the examples to work. There other ways but you can get my point.

**** "they can to change up a lot of things or make Harry completely different"

We said the same thing. They have to rewrite the entire story and characters.

***** You could go the op Harry route and mot change his character. This is fanfiction we're talking about here if you don't change things you're not writing fanfiction you're plagiarizing.
