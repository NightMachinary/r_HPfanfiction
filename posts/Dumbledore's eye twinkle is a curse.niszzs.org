Just saw this as a joke by [[/u/MinskWurdalak][u/MinskWurdalak]] and I couldn't resist prompting to see what happens


** There was a one shot where it turned out dumbledore saw a great old one in the night sky and the twinkle is a sign of Lovecraftian inspired madness. He takes Harry up to the astronomy tower and a great old ones eye opens up in the night sky. Boom now Harry has a twinkle.

Heads up I may have been a little off regarding the plot. been a while since I read it. Must have been mixing a comedic story with this one.

** A story idea I once had was that an ancestor of Dumbledore was an evil witch and the origin of the concept of the Evil Eye and that whenever you saw the twinkle you knew they were casting a spell with just the eyes. I would love to see someone run with this.

  Tucked under Regulus's arm was an old, hand bound book in a deep maroon. Embossed on the frayed leather were the words, 'The Purest Art of the Patronus: A guide to defending with Light'. Unlike the books in the Black Library, Sirius couldn't feel the oily oppressiveness of Dark Magic. If the title hadn't given it away, the Magic definitely would have.The book was pure Light Magic. Wherein Sirius questions the facts he thought he knew and Regulus fails to hate.
