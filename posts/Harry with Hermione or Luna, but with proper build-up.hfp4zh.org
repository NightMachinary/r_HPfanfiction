I want some Harry/Hermione or Harry/Luna fics that have actual proper build-up to the romance. I'll accept most other het pairings as well, these are just the ones I prefer. Preferably without anything like a soul-bond or whatever. I've been running out of fics that are half-way decent.


** Maybe [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7700]] ?

For H/Hr I find the best divergence points are either Goblet of Fire or the Tent after Ron leaves.

Fics that start earlier usually have authors who want to signal/forshadow their preferred pairing, which leads to *creepy 11 year old flirting*. Or worse.

GoF is a good point for relationship development because the characters are basically just at the 'notice the other sex' stage, so forshadowing of later relationships is less creepy. It also fits the narrative, being after the hippogriff flight and the Triwizard shenanigans.

Of course, stories based on the tent usually rely entirely on canon background with little custom build up.

For Luna, maybe Harry Potter and the Distaff side?

  The summer after Harry's fourth year would have been much better if just one person in his life had disregarded Professor Dumbledore's instructions to ignore him. And if that person was Hermione Granger? It would have been much, much better.

  Set in an alternative universe where Harry Potter met Luna Lovegood in his fourth year rather than his fifth year at Hogwarts, this series follows the two teenagers as they slowly begin to notice each-other as more than just-friends. A somewhat slow-build up over several short chapters, with plenty of fluff and a little bit of angst. Romione is a side-pairing. (Rated T to be safe)

** linkffn(6587324)

My favourite Lunarry one-shot after Monstrous.

After Sirius dies, Harry learns at his will reading that he's not a super rich Lord Potter-Black but actually so poor he can't even afford to go to Hogwarts for his 6th year. Meanwhile, the Lovegoods are in trouble with the Death Eaters because of things in the Quibbler so Xeno has pulled Luna out of Hogwarts and left her with the Order while he goes abroad for a while.

Together in Grimmauld Place, tutored by Order members, Harry and Luna slowly get closer throughout the year until they finally get together.

And in case that's not your thing, it contains mild Ginny bashing. She's jealous of their relationship and so says some very mean things to Luna to try and get her to give up on Harry.

​

And here's Monstrous: linkffn(12754810)

There's a lot of moments between them before they get together but the romance between Harry/Luna is secondary and not the focus of the story. I like it mainly because of the rest.
