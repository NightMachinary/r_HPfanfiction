With only very few people in the wizarding world knowing anything about computers, there's not a lot of competition. And wizarding governments are unlikely to do much about data protection.

Voldemort couldn't have dreamt of this kind of power.


** Just wait until you realise smartwands could be a thing in that continuity; a wand that will perform any spell, communicate to any witch or wizard and allow you to stream classes, lectures and videos for as long as you like.

In exchange, of course, those super-expensive pieces of kit tell anyone with backdoor access everything about you, which has led to more than one Dark Uprising being more successful than anything that came before it.

*** Wands are pretty personal and complicated. People probably wouldn't replace them with some weird new thing. Maybe a little elastic ring that could be put on a wand to give it some special functionality?

I think the smart device for wizards would probably look similar to a phone, just running on magic instead of electricity and with some abilities that a normal phone can't do. A internet communications device needs to be something people can easily carry around and it needs to be able to display information, so the pocket sized screen is pretty much the ideal format already. Although wizard phones not being limited by technology could probably be unfoldable all the way up to a TV size.

The wizarding internet would probably be pretty similar to ours, with the tiny population of the magical world there wouldn't be much independent innovation and they'd be mostly busy figuring out how to copy things from the muggle internet. No need to reinvent the wheel when you can get rich with a Facebook clone.
