o In the beginning of the second half of summer in 1997AD, half a dozen rangers of the Night's Watch journey Beyond the Wall and go into the Haunted Forest; they investigate the sudden disappearances of wildlings. In the forest, they find the corpses of twenty wildlings fixated in an ancient rudiment. However, before they have time to travel back to Castleblack, in order to inform their higher superiors, the party is attacked, killed, and turned by a race believed gone; the White Walkers. After they turn them and the wildlings to inferie, the White Walker host observes a raven as it flies off east.

o The raven flies over Europe, until it arrives to a dark forest, located in the middle of Albania. Perching above on a tree, the crow watches a man, who has two faces, try to execute a dark and an ancient ritual, in hopes of giving the face on the back of his head a corporeal form. The ritual fails and the crow is spotted. The last thing the raven sees is a green light jetting towards him. These lucid dreams cause Jon Stark at Winterfell and Harry Potter at Number Four Private Drive to wake up in cold sweat.

o In the morning, the fifteen-year-old Jon Stark tries to go back to sleep, but he never has the chance when his eleven-year-old sister, Arya Stark, barges into his room and gets him out of bed. Arya leads her brother downstairs to Winterfell's Great Hall which is where his family wait to celebrate his birthday. As they celebrate his birthday, Lyanna sees that something is bothering her son. She asks if he's okay, he tells her he's fine, right before he accepts Theon Greyjoy's challenge at a wizard duel.

o At Number Four Private Drive, living in a cupboard underneath a staircase, the soon to be eleven-year-old boy, Harry Potter, continues his life as a servant to the Dursleys until he receives multiple letters. The Dursleys are not happy and try to confiscate the letters addressed to him. The owls that deliver the letters keep coming which causes Vernon Dursley to make a radical decision. This causes the Dursleys to leave the house, where they plan to travel to a small hut, which they rented on a rocky island on the North Sea. When they leave the house they are watched by a cat on the street.

o In his chambers at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Professor Albus Dumbledore starts to prepare for the wars to come; he evaluates the signs which hint that darkness is coming. These signs are the Night King slowly building his army and Voldemort waiting for the chance to rise again.

o However, his contemplations are interrupted when Professor Minerva McGonagall arrives to his study. She informs him his plan to annoy Vernon and Petunia with owls in order to pressure them to give Harry his letter has backfired. Instead it has caused them to leave Number Four Private Drive to escape the owls. Minerva reveals to Albus that the boy's uncle has rented a beaten down shack on a rocky island, located in the middle of the North Sea, fifty miles off the north eastern coast of England.

o Albus finds Vernon's and Petunia's attempts to keep Harry isolated from the wizard world comical, while in contrast, Minerva finds their endeavors to be signs of child abuse towards their nephew. Albus conveys his plans to have Hagrid deal with them, but Minerva reveals she is going to Winterfell, to inform Harry Potter's Godmother of the abuse that her godson has endured with the Dursleys. Albus aversely agrees to go to Winterfell with her to inform Lyanna Stark about her godson's current state.

o In the outside dueling yard, Jon Stark and Theon Greyjoy face each other in a duel, while the Starks watch from the catwalk balcony above. The duel between the two teenagers is intense and extremely close. However, right before Jon finds a weakness in Theon's form, Albus Dumbledore and Minerva McGonigle arrive on scene; just in time to watch the last couple minutes of the duel until Jon disarms Theon.

o Albus congratulates Jon and Theon on having great duel, while Minerva warns them to not get into the habit of doing underage wizardry, even though there isn't an age for it in Westeros now. However, before they can reply, Lyanna and Ned appear; they remind their professors that they became such great duelers by practicing it outside of the school, even when there was a legal age enacted in Westeros.

o After an exchange of small talk, Ned Stark and Lyanna Stark realize their former professors have apparated to Winterfell to enlighten them on a problem, which concerns of getting a magical letter delivered to a boy, without having his aunt and uncle deriving it from him. Lyanna gets it and is not happy, however she keeps her temper in check, until she and her brother lead them inside to Ned's solar.

o This is where Albus and Minerva inform them about the Dursleys ill-treatment towards Harry. Lyanna gets furious when Minerva tells her she has been watching Harry for the last couple months. And that there is ample evidence that her godson has been a victim to possible child abuse. Lyanna with her brother's backing informs Albus that she will not let Harry stay at Number Four Private Drive anymore. She demands custody of her godson just like she did right after James and Lily were killed.

o Albus hesitantly agrees to her demands before he tells her that Vernon and Petunia have rented a beaten down shack on a small rocky island in the middle the North Sea so that they could stop the owls from delivering letters. This just makes Lyanna even more pissed off at the Dursleys and at Dumbledore.

o Dumbledore mentions to Ned and Lyanna that Harry does not know the truth. Lyanna and Ned vow to tell him. When they are done, the headmaster and the headmistress prepare to apparate back to Hogwarts. However, just before they apparate back, Minerva gives Lyanna Harry's last acceptance letter. Albus advises Lyanna to send a patronus to Rubeus Hagrid so that he can meet her on the island. After Albus and Minerva leave Ned's solar, Lyanna asks Ned to send Jon and Arya into her study.

o Once her teen and her preteen arrive, Lyanna informs her fifteen-year-old son and her eleven-year-old daughter they are about to go on a journey, which might be a little wet and a little windy. Arya is excited but asks where are they going. She answers by making them hold on, before they apparate to an island, where they meet Hagrid. Her son and her greet him, before she introduces Arya to Hagrid. After this, Lyanna tells her son and daughter, they are here to get their godbrother, Harry Potter.

o Inside the cabin, Harry is the only one up, he glumly celebrates his birthday while everyone else sleeps. After he blows out a drawing he made, he closes his eyes and tries to go to sleep. However, his relatives and him wake up, right when the front door is blown open by a raven-haired lady and a giant man.
