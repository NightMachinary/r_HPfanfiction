:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So the only scene I remember from this fic is that Harry is travelling alone in a carriage on the Hogwarts express. Apparently Ron and Hermione have elected not to sit with him. Daphne and Tracey come along into the carriage and strike up a conversation with him, initially egging him on his bloated ego and other stuff. When asked if the chamber of secrets incident and the other incidents he's known to have been in were true he just stand and gets his shirt off to show them the scars. Both of them apparently close their eyes but he asks them to feel the scars. Once done Tracey blurts out "Can you show me again!?"

So ya. Any clue on this?


** I assure u, that is not how people act

*** I am sure. However, that is precisely how Tracey reacts in the fic. Also, that is why I remember the fic in the first place!!

** This definitely sounds familiar to me. I'll see if I can find it.

Edit: found it, it's linkffn(11825585) and actually a Harry/Fleur story, although Daphne does play a somewhat significant role, especially in the earlier chapters. Here's a direct link since I probably did the bot thing wrong: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11825585/4/Gods-Amongst-Men]]

** It realy is Haphne? Because I have for a rule to try and read all the new Haphne I can find and don't remember any form of that situation you present. That leads me to two possibilities: It doesn't have Daphne Greengrass in the characters list or it has very bad writting

*** I do believe it is Haphne. However, I cannot in good conscience say that it has very bad writing. It was in fact rather good. If I do chance upon it, or someone points me to the right fic I shall let you know.
