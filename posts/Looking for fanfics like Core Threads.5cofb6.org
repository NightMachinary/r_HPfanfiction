I know there is already a thread for this but that thread is no longer commented on so... Thanks for any help.

** That [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5714n6/fics_similar_to_core_threads_by_theaceonfire/][thread]] has /over a dozen/ fics. If /none/ of those satisfied you then there must be something specific you want to see. I'm sure if you elaborate on what that is, you'll find what you're searching for.

*** I have read all but 3 of the fics mentioned on that thread. Barbaric magic is too little words. I am not a fan of girl harry and not a fan of Hermione being the main character. Those are the three I haven't read on that list.
