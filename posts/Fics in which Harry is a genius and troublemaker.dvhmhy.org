Could be Harry is amazing at potions and loves making things explode, frequently terrorizes teachers, or endeavors in making spells for laughs/to cause trouble. Looking for an overall eccentric, funny, and intelligent Harry


** I'd say that Potter Club, likely fits this bill to some extent.

  Seven years is a long time. Especially when you have to do it twice. You know what you have to do and you think you know how you'll do it, so what can you do in the meantime? Live up your family legacy of course. It's time for a changing of the guard; the Marauders time is over, now it's time for Potter Club to step up

** "Mr. Potter! Could you please explain how you caused a hole in the wall of a classroom and a one hundred feet wide crater in the mountain north of the school? You were supposed to work on your muggle studies project, but from the rumors I've heard it sounds like you were attempting to turn lead into gold!"

"Xenon and copper."

"Excuse me?"

"I was trying to turn xenon and copper into gold, Professor McGonagall. You see, muggles can turn one element into another, but it's really limited. A few months ago I had the idea to see if I could improve upon the method with magic, and that became my muggle studies project."

"And would you explain to me how that resulted in a massive crater? Not even your father managed that!"

"Well, you see, I read this really fascinating nuclear physics book and my idea was to bombard a Copper-65 target with Xenon-132, producing Bismut-197 which takes about three days to decay into stable gold. So I started building a particle accelerator. Have you ever used /Arresto Momentum/ on a moving train? Well, I did and I figured out that it can stop things relative to different frames of reference, so what I tried to do to accelerate the particles was to arrest them in a frame of reference moving towards the target at really high speed. I finished the instant accelerating rune array yesterday, and before I start on the vacuum chamber, xenon source and bismuth seperator, I wanted to test it. So tried to see if it could accelerate a pebble. Unfortunately I messed up my calculation for the test velocity by confusing meters and kilometers per second, so I ended up accelerating the pebble to a small fraction of light speed. I think that was roughly what happened, Professor. On the positive side, if Voldemort tries to attack Hogwarts we got what's basically a railgun."

** linkffn(In the Mind of a Scientist by ZenoNoKyuubi) - Mad scientist Harry. Does crazy shit in the pursuit of magical science. His teachers are spared from the worst of it, but his classmates, especially poor Hermione, may be traumatized for life.

linkffn(Harry Potter, Geek of Magic by jlluh) - Borderline idiot savant Harry, and hilarious because of it. He's a serious transfiguration prodigy. He doesn't really deliberately do crazy things in pursuit of learning, it's just that he ceaselessly experiments with transfiguration and doesn't spend a moment thinking about the dangers/consequences of it.

** hey! My recs might not be good but in terms of smart harry you could try Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. He's definitely really intelligent and eccentric, as for funny... he's funny in a way that anyone with 6 PHDs would find funny, but not in an amusing way IMO. I'm going to be honest, I made it through the first book but I couldn't slog through the rest of it. It can be really hit or miss, but it is definitely a serious fic that requires a lot of mental effort to get through (i was not willing to exert that effort lol). Some people have written posts in this subreddit about why they love or hate HPMOR, so I would definitely read some of those reviews before you start reading. Here's the link: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality]]

So now that i've got the obligatory HPMOR rec out of the way, I'm going to rec something that I really liked. It's called Oh God Not Again, and the premise is basically that harry goes back in time from when he was 23 into his 11 year old body and basically decides to have a good time and fuck with everyone. I thought it was really funny, and although he isn't technically smarter, he's 23 so of course he makes way better decisions about everything and does super well in school. If you can get over the time travel aspect of it, then I definitely recommend it :) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again]]

There is currently another bot called [[/u/kzreminderbot][u/kzreminderbot]] that is duplicating the functionality of this bot. Since it replies to the same RemindMe! trigger phrase, you may receive a second message from it with the same reminder. If this is annoying to you, please click [[https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=kzreminderbot&subject=Feedback%21%20KZ%20Reminder%20Bot][this link]] to send feedback to that bot author and ask him to use a different trigger.
