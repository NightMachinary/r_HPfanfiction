OMG, guys. I was just reading this harry/cedric fanfic that I remembered recently.

In the fanfic they is no Voldemort. James and Lily are alive.

Harry and Cedric end up dating. While characters like George Weasley come out.

Bellatrix and Rudolphus have a child, Susanne Lestrange, who doesn't believe in the pureblood doctrine.

The fic is called What If It Never Happened. The author has detached their account from the fanfic so I can't find the sequel.

The sequel was about Cedric and Harry having kids through surrogacy. And they were married.

Please help me find it.


** Edit: Sorry I somehow read it wrong and posted the first one.

** Would be tedious but it could help if no one can help you out:. You could look for people who bookmarked the original on ao3 and search through their other bookmarks to see if someone bookmarked the sequel and you recognise it when reading the title/tags/summary.
