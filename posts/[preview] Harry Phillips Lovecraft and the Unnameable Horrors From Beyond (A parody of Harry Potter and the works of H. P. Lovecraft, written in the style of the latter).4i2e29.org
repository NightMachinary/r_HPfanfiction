The queer events that preceded the young Harry Phillips Lovecraft's disappearance from his New England home in the town of Arkham are known to few, and understood by far fewer. Indeed, the tales the boy had told upon his return gave credence to both the odd happenstance that had surrounded the boy for all his youth, and, conversely, to the theory that his imagination was at work in some boyish charlatanry. In the realm of certainty, when one lingers too long on a subject, it begins to fade into that much larger, looming realm of uncertainty. It is, therefore, the duty of the reader to discern whether these events are the fanciful imaginings of an adolescent mind, or a peek beyond that veil which science and skepticism have so long tried to draw tight, for fear of their own well-being.

On July 24, 1991, a letter arrived at the Phillips household. The boy's grandfather and head of the house, Whipple, was away on business, and Harry's own habits about the house were limited to ticking away on the old typewriter in the study and staring absently from the window in the upstairs sitting room at the sprawling city of Arkham beyond. As such, he was not nearby when a tawny owl dropped into the mail slot, with a peculiar deftness, a bit of wax-sealed parchment. It was midday when he happened by the door and saw his own name where the recipient's would be. It bore no stamps, and it was not coupled with the other bits of mail, which would arrive in the afternoon. He cut the wax with a pen knife in his Grandfather's study, and for a reason he could not find the words describe, although he was possessed of the vocabulary and mannerisms of a boy much older than his eleven years could display (due in great measure to the seclusion he often sought within his grandfather's library), his small hands trembled with the action.

At the first line of the letter, the essential nature of his upbringing, which was comprised of those remnants of both an English ancestry and Yankee, Puritanical sentimentality, brought upon him such a chill that he could scarcely keep from shuddering and gasping aloud.

/HOGWARTS SCHOOL OF WITCHCRAFT AND WIZARDRY/

/Headmaster: Albus Dumbledore/

/(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards)/

/Dear Mr. Phillips Lovecraft,/

/We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment./

/Term begins on 1 September. We await your owl by no later than 31 July./

/Yours Sincerely,/

/Minerva McGonagall/

Upon completing the letter, such a fit seized Harry that his breath grew shorter, and rather than endure further contemplation of such eldritch things as the letter suggested, his young body elected to crumple mercifully to a spell of fainting.

When he woke, Harry was being tended to by the venerable and benevolent manservant, Algernon, who had been in employ of the Phillips family since long before young Harry's arrival to the estate, following the tragic death, an event that is seldom mentioned, and even then in hushed whispers, of his parents.

The servant inquired as to Harry's state when the boy had gathered the majority of his senses. “What brought you to lay so spread out upon the ground, young Master Harry? Did you slip in the midst of some horseplay?” The latter question he asked with some hope in his voice, for Algernon had always urged Harry towards the more jovial and energetic aspects of boyhood, much to Harry's chagrin.

“Didn't you see the letter?” Harry asked.

At this, old Algernon's silver brows furrowed, bringing his pale forehead into a bundle. “It wasn't I who discovered you, but your grandfather, Master Whipple. He made no mention of any letter.”

Harry sat in solemn silence, for he dreaded meeting with his stern and stoic grandfather for any reason. The thick-necked master of the house was difficult to approach under the most jovial of circumstances, let alone regarding the mad contents of some horrid letter.

After an earnest effort at making himself look presentable, a chore made formidable by his unruly black hair and a strange scar on his forehead, he made his way up to his grandfather's study. People's eyes always lingered on the mark whenever they would chance to see it, and Harry's own eyes on his reflection were no exception. It was such a queer mark, resembling a lopsided sort of star, that his grandfather implored him to wear a hat on the seldom occasion that they would venture into a public place.

Once, when Harry was very young, and still somewhat immune to old Whipple's short, cold demeanor, he asked very insistently about the scar's origins. His grandfather had told him that another child in the foster home had seized upon Harry in a fit of madness, as the child had been afflicted with some malady of the mind. This broke the seal on a number of other things that Harry had been storing within his child mind, quite especially the nature of his orphanhood.

At this, his grandfather only hinted that it was a great tragedy, and not something for someone as young as Harry to ponder. Harry now suspected that he only learned that much because Whipple had been deep in his cups, and red with the scotch that he so loved in those days.


** Nice. Very excellent capture of more classical writing styles. I would be interested to see more.
