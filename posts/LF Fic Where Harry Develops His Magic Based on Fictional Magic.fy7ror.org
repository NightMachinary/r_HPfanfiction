Like, Harry grows up playing games like Final Fantasy, Dungeons and Dragons and World of Warcraft, and when he realizes he can use magic he shapes his way of casting around the magic he sees in his games. And since HP Magic is so "Fluid" and "Malleable" he manages to invent a new way of casting magic.

Are there any fics like this? I'd like to read a decently long one, and I'd prefer it to be finished but I can accept unfinished ones that you consider really well done. Also no slash please, not a fan of reading that since most writers have no idea how to write a homosexual relationship without vastly changing the characters personalities.


** This one focus on DnD and is completed, it's the only thing I can think of that fits.

  Harry Potter discovers the Player Handbook for Advanced Dungeons and Dragons, 2nd Edition after experiencing accidental magic and realizes he may have magic. Directed to a hobby shop, he develops his own style of magic based on tabletop RPGs and comics. Then, he gets his Hogwarts letter. Dark!Indie!Sarcastic!Paranoid!Pragmatic!Harry. Rated M for language and graphic violence.

  The summer before his fifth year, Harry obtains a computer and an internet connection. Two months later, he emerges a changed person, for what has been seen cannot be unseen.

** linkffn(Of Wands and Kunai) he comes to the obvious conclusion that he's a Naruto style ninja and gives himself a chakra network via blind faith and magical power. Then reverse engineers jitsu from the manga. Which is very confusing to actual ninja, wizards, and the guy who gave Harry a box of manga that apparently don't actually exist.

  A 7 year old Harry stumbles on a box of old Naruto manga. Inspired, he reaches deep within, using chakra to quickly become a phenomenal ninja. And thus begins a curious tale. Read and see how it ends! Read 1st chapter A/N...story is officially abandoned.
