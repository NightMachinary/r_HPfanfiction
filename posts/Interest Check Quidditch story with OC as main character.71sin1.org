I've been toying with this idea for a while and I think Quidditch has all the ingredients to make for an interesting sports story in the Harry Potter universe. However, I don't want to use Harry or Ginny or someone else from the canon as a protagonist because they don't fit the kind of story I wanna tell.

For chronological setting I wanted to use a period that hasn't been explored much so I was torn between the 1980's and the 2000's - both transitional periods in the HPverse - before deciding on the latter. There will be plenty of Quidditch action but I'm thinking the focus will be primarily on the characters' growth as players, competitors and people.

There will also be plenty of cameos from canon characters, just not on protagonist roles.

If anyone is interested in reading something like that let me know.


** I love a good quidditch fic, I'd be interested.

** Would read, though with OC protagonists there's always the challenge of getting the reader to symphatise with a completely original character.

  Like, JKR writing Quidditch scenes was okay, and I haven't really seen any stories that do it better than that.

And even she most often used Quidditch for story:

Year 1:

- Cursed Broom,
- Normal match, but Snape refereeing. Very short. (No on-screen Quidditch /at all/ - focus on Malfoy taunting Neville / Ron / Hermione)
- (Harry in hospital wing)

Year 2:

- Bludger
- (called off because attacks)
- (called off because attacks)

Year 3:

- Dementors
- Malfoy pretends to be dementor, Harry casts patronus, catches snitch.
- Normal, albeit rough match

Year 4:(GoF, no quidditch)

Year 5:

- Normal match, but Harry/Fred/George attack Malfoy, get banned 'for life'.
- (banned from quidditch)
- (banned from quidditch)

Year 6:

- Normal match, 1st as captain,
- Normal match, Harry gets knocked out by bludger - very short.
- (in detention)

Like we have seen five 'normal' matches in total, and each one of those had a special twist to it as well - one of them had no Quidditch at all. The other ten possible matches that could have been played either had their highlight outside of the pitch or Harry did not play at all.

I don't know how good of a writer you are, but it seems very hard to do a Quidditch-Fic well. I have seen a few that /try/, but most wen't good, and I tended to skip over the matches.

If you do it, prepare to have a lot of stuff going on outside of the matches, because the matches won't carry the fic, I think.

*** Since this will be a Quidditch fic I'll naturally be going a little bit deeper than JKR did, but I won't make the story all about the game of course. I'm looking to find a good balance :)

Thanks for the feedback!

** I love sports and your premise is a great idea that I toyed with for a writing class. I have notes I can share from three stories I never wrote. If you're familiar with the HBO series Hard Knocks its sounds like its on the same thematic trajectory as your story. It might be a place to draw ideas from. This [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBSf3RZHwnE][clip]] reminds of the self aware mindset Seekers have.

**** I'll scan them or type them up and DM you. And I see you like the NBA so I'll leave the sports metaphors and references in.

** I feel like it's going to be a pretty hard struggle for you to write a story like this, and have it be interesting. Firstly, you have the problem that it's a Quidditch Story. Lots of people have tried to write them, but the problem is that Quidditch itself tends to be boring (though it's a split between the sport itself being boring, and authors not being very good at writing it), and then when you add in background stuff like draft picks, or scoring percentages... it gets really wordy. Like, JKR writing Quidditch scenes was okay, and I haven't really seen any stories that do it better than that.

So, you're already starting at a disadvantage, then you add in an OC. That's even more of a disadvantage, because why should a reader care about an OC? And readers can see through thin attempts to try and connect the story to canon by having known characters show up occasionally.

I think you got your work cut out for you.
