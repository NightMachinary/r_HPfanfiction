I'm looking for fics where harry travels to an alternate universe. I would want him to work undercover. That is he doesn't reveal anything to anyone. Just comes in saves the day, throws a wrench into voldys plans and just vanishes. Something like what happens in "I'm still here".


** Linkffn(From Ruin) is almost cheating to suggest as it's the same plot (with permission) as "I'm Still Here." It's slightly longer, well written, but as yet unfinished.

Unfortunately most of the "powerful Harry from effin nowhere" stories I've seen have been time travel, rather than alternate universe - although at least one has ended up /creating/ an AU because of it. Linkffn(Wind Shear; Whiskey Time Travel; Delenda Est).

  It all went wrong. Harry is locked away in Azkaban for decades as Voldemort destroys and conquers the magical world and beyond unchallenged. However, Voldemort's greatest strength will be used against him, and Harry is sent back in time with one mission: to kill the Dark Lord before he rises again.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1978, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter, 1978

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

  Harry sacrificed everything to kill the Dark Lord. He sacrificed more to kill the next one. And the next. And the next. By the end, he had nothing left to give, and nothing left to win. Burdened by failure, he's thrown into a new world with familiar faces and unfamiliar personalities, and must fight to survive. AU, Dimension Travel, Graphic Violence.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12331839/1/Realignment]] is time travel but in the past long enough for it to be essentially an alternate universe. It's an intriguing premise where Harry travels to kill Tom Riddle but is stopped by Dumbledore. It's not quite your request but if you've exhausted a lot of time travel fics, this is my personal favorite of all time.

** Not EXACTLY what you requested, but I think most of the Lone Traveler series would be right up your alley?

He usually does reveal himself to a couple of people though, and he helps people to help themselves instead of just solving everything for them
