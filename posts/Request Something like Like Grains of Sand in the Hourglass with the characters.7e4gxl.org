I'm currently reading Like Grains of Sand in the Hourglass: I really like how the characters written except for Molly and Ginny; and Dumbledore is a bit iffy but still relatively believable.

fflink: /12188150/

Luna is a bit iffy as well; but for the most part okay.

I'm looking for stories where the characters are written like that.

Any rating is fine, am fine with het/slash/femslash

Would like it to be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is okay.

Note it doesn't have to have time travel; just the characters being written similar to that. Except for Molly, Albus and maybe Ginny and Luna if they could be written better in the stories. But I'd be okay with it if they were written like that.

You're really kind. Luna is completely OOC in this story. She also has a bad case of seer!Luna.

Still an entertaining fic, imho.

*** At least it's given reasonable justification in-universe. Her mother's experiments had side effects on little Luna.

** Could you elaborate on what you mean written like "that"? I kind of avoid Temporal Knight's stuff after trying to get into Rune Stone Path like three times and dropping it in the first few chapters.
