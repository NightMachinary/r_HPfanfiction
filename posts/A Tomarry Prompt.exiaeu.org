Prompt: Harry travels back in time to Tom Riddle's era. This is after Tom got rejected to teach dada. Instead of being hostile Harry decided to join Tom in his travels. As time goes on Tom starts to let his guard down and begins to get close with Harry. Likewise Harry is starting to believe Tom has a heart.

If you take up this prompt please let me know so I can read it.


** The plan had been simple, really; follow Tom Riddle around and find a way to kill him before he got too powerful. Unfourtantly, the three Horcruxes Harry suspected had already been made were not in locations the would be several decades in the future. So, his plan to stalk the young Dark Lord turned into traveling the world with him. Fine, Harry was adaptable. At least he could still keep an eye on what Tom did and try to prevent him from indulging in anything too dark.

What he had not counted on was having fun. That was certainly not part of the plan. Nor was enjoying the in depth discussions about magic he was drawn into with the charasmatic Slytherin. This was supposed to be a mission. One last struggle before he could lay to rest at last. He no way to return to his previous life, after all.

But sitting here, laughing, under the stars in the Egyptian desert, he couldn't help but not mind so much that there was no going back. In this moment, he didn't want to leave. Didn't want to go back to his own country or time. He wanted to forget everything Tom had done and would eagerly do again.

"You know;" Tom said abruptly, looking away from the galaxies that spun above him to meet Harry's eyes, "This really wasn't what I had in mind."

Harry frowned a bit, trying to read the young man's expression. "What do you mean? Had in mind for what?"

"Well, you. Once I figured out you were following me I decided you would have to be killed. I just had to find out how much you knew first, and if you were the only one."

"And have you?" Harry found himself whispering. There was a sinking in his heart but he couldn't name the emotion the broiled there. It had been so long since he felt anything but bitter determination, but these past few months he had found himself feeling things he hadn't since before Hogwarts.

"No, not really." Can the nonchalant reply, as if they merely discussing the weather. "I still can't seem to figure that bit out. I just wasn't expecting to not mind so much. You're a puzzle, Harry Evans... Though I doubt that's your real name. It's been so long since something truly interesting came along, I find myself almost wishing it could go on forever."

"Oh. And... It can't?"

Tom sighed and lay back down against the blanket they had spread out. "I'm not sure. I just don't know, and that bothers me quite a bit. After all, I'm fairly certain you plan to slit my throat the moment you get the chance."

"Maybe nothing quite so messy." He slowly admitted, laying down next to the much taller man. "But that was my intention, yes."

"And it isn't anymore." Tom softly concluded.

"I don't know."

For a while, they lay there in silence, staring up at the stars. The blanket was charmed to keep any unpleasant creatures away, and to protect them somewhat from the elements. It was no magically enlarged tent but it was surprisingly comfortable.

Despite his every effort for his mind to not go there, Harry couldn't help but wonder if this is what Dumbledore felt with Grindelwald. It was so easy to ignore the reality of who this person was beside him and get lost in the feeling of freedom. Tom felt... Like an equal. They weren't the Boy-Who-Lived and Lord Voldemort, or the Chosen One and the Dark Lord, or even the Master of Death and the one who claimed his soul. They were just Harry and Tom.

Well, it wasn't like he could kill Tom when he still had Horcruxes out of reach. And Tom most definitely couldn't kill Harry, though the other one wasn't aware of this fact. Yes, perhaps it was better to just stay like this for a while longer. Keep your friends close and your enemies closer, and all that.

But even as Harry drifted off to sleep, illogically unconcerned about their most recent conversation, he couldn't help but wonder if they were truly enemies at all.
