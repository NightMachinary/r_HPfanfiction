I've always loved those solstice celebrations fics or ones where wizards have actually developed different cultural practices than muggles. I'd love to see some well written ones, but preferably without the “Dumbledore is evil and disrupting the balance of magic” trope. Thanks!


** The Perfectly Normal series by BrilliantLady is this. I should say that this Harry has god awful taste in roll models, and spends a lot of the series /thinking/ that Dumbledore is evil (basically just taking the least charitable interpretations of Dumbledore's canon actions), but he is not and Harry learns this eventually.

The first (very short) fic is entirely pre-Hogwarts and serves to set up Harry's character as being more damaged by the Dursley's abuse and much more non-confrontational and manipulative. He starts participating in solstice rituals at Hogwarts in the second fic, which covers his first year (also pretty short). Currently the author is publishing (1 or 2 chapters a week) the fourth year fic, which I think is the sixth fic in the series since the summer between third and fourth year got their own fic.

Anyway, enough blabbing, here's the link.

  A young Harry learns the everyday power of words. He's going to make the Dursleys happy by being "normal". Then they'll love him, just like they love Dudley! It's a flawless plan... right? Smart!Harry, Manipulative!Harry, canonical level child neglect/abuse. Complete. Part 1 of the "Perfectly Normal" series.

**** I quite agree, and I love that it's such a bait and switch where you start out thinking it's going to be about this abused kid who lacks confidence but is pretty sneaky and manipulative, but then before you know it this whole fascinating world just blossoms around you.

**** Yeah, I definitely wouldn't want to read 100 stories in a row where Harry acts like this, but it's the only one I ever read, and variety is the spice of life.

I do think a well written badass Harry fic will be nice as a palate cleanser afterwards. It's been a long time since I've read The Lie I've Lived, maybe I'll read that next. I think that Harry had an overabundance of spine.

  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn. Then he gets the bad news: he's been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.

** Linkffn(New Blood by Artemisgirl) is a Hermione-centric fic that deals quite a bit with those kinds of things, among others. There quite a bit of worldbuilding.

  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means. ((Short chapters, done scene by scene))

  AU, where nothing as simple as good vs. evil. A summer spent trapped in Number 4 and barred from contact with his friends leads to Harry accepting an offer to correspond with a Death Eater. The consequences of thinking for oneself are far reaching.
