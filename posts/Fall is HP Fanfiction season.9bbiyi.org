Or at least that's how I feel every fall, and I'm not exactly sure why. Everytime fall rolls around I get the urge to scan LJ for potter fic, maybe because that was my routine in high school. Now I can't do that since HP on LJ is dead, but that feeling still emerges. I talked to a friend of mine and she said that she associates fall with fanfiction too. Maybe it's because fall marked the back to school season, and many of the writers were students and thus more material was being produced.

Anyway is this how anyone else feels? That particular seasons make them feel more inclined to read fanfic?


** All year is fanfic season :') I suspect there will be an upswing soon as people get into the mood for NaNoWriMo, though!

I can't wait for the holidays to be over because then all these papers for University and the field trips are done. Regular lecture time is a lot more convenient for writing than "holidays" stuffed full with writing assignments, independent research projects and group work.

** Well, NaNoWriMo is in fall. Maybe that's why you associate fall with an increase of fanfiction?
