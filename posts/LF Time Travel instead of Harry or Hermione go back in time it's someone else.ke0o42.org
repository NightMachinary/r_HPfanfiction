Anyone can be the MC, any site, any length, old or new. Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine

Am fine with het/slash/femslash/threesomes etc. Doesn't have to focus on pairings

Woul rather NOT have Weasley Bashing. No Weasley's using Harry for his fame and fortune, no Ginny giving Harry a love potion, etc.

  Lavender takes one step forward and -- just like the snap of a finger, the blink of an eye, the drop of a pebble -- Hogwarts is left behind. There's no jump, no flashes of light, no whirlwinds of disconnected images. Just one little step; behind stood her war and in front stands 1947. "Huh," she says to herself, "didn't see this in the tea leaves."

  When Ron Weasley realized he was reborn to the world with his memories mostly intact, he felt it was a second chance to do better. However, he slowly realizes that this world was different from his own. Making new friends and earning new enemies, he has to use his experience from his previous life not only to reach his goals, but also to survive. AU

  Mess with power and you get what you deserve. Bilia Stevens had nothing left to lose when she took the wand, stone and cloak, so if she could meddle with time and space and gain eternal protection from death, why wouldn't she?"Send me where I can do the Wizarding World the most good," she said, as a sop to Fate, but it was Death that laughed in her ears as she tumbled into the nasty little bedroom of a nasty little man.Well, Bilia Stevens wasn't all that nice herself, if it came to it.
