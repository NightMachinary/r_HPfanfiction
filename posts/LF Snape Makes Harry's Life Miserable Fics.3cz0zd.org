HI, I'm looking for fanfics where Snape makes Harry's life hell. Bullying, git uses Dark magic, etc. Canon or AU, I don't mind.

I don't want Snarry and I don't want fics where Snape finally likes Harry or the other way round. Although, if there is an epiphany or understanding, that's okay.

Thanks in advance

I haven't read this one in a while, but I'm pretty sure Snape is a super creep in it. linkffn(Harry Potter and the Final Straw by bellerophon30)
