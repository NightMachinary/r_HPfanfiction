From the readers point of view I feel like we shown the slow progression of Neville becoming more and more confident and courageous, but all of a sudden in the final battle he is acting like he is da man. Not only do I feel like it would be interesting to see how what Neville went through in book 7 just to see him grow as person, but it all seems like the things that they would have gotten into would have been like book 5 on steroids. There is so much on the line for them as students, and they had to have gone through some shit.

If your looking just for book 7 then you can skip to later chapters, this shows the entire series from Ginny's point of view.
