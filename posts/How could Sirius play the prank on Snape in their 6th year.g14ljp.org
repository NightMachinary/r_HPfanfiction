**** POA. "Have you forgotten he has proven capable of murder when he was 16", something like that. But yes, it was before SWM.

****** Yeah, in /The Prince's Tale,/ Lily snaps that she knows that James saved Severus from whatever lives in the tunnel beneath the Whomping Willow, which happened before the Worst Memory.

Though that begs the question of what exactly happened that caused the prank in the first place.

******* Yeah I find that so interesting, I read a lot of fanfic about the prank and the marauders all hate Sirius for ages but depending on the time frame it seems to me they probably moved on quite quickly - however, I wouldn't be suprised if Remus held some resentment about it deep down, to me he seems the type to just internalise things instead of conflict or maybe he just loved having friends he was willing to forgive anything because jk Rowling said he was a â€˜ lonely boy' growing up

** We only know 2 things about this prank, it happened when Sirius was 16 (since Snape say that he was capable of murder at that age), and it happened before Snape memory.

Since we know that Sirius was born in November 1959 (though not sure it's clearly said in canon) and that the OWL happen around May or June, we can determine that the even happened between these 2 dates. Personally, I would say it was either in February or March 1975 (Lily was fed up with Snape story about Lupin so it could not be too fresh when they split up).

*** She was fed up with his story when she said James saved him from it 'the other day'... Which suggested that he did actually had the theory about werewolf Lupin before the prank
