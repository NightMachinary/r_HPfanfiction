Hi, everyone!

I've recently become obsessed with ObsidianPen and am trying to read all her stories. According to DLP's scryer, she used to have a lot of things on FFnet, but the whole account is deleted and only some of them are on AO3. I'm kind of dying right now. If anyone has any copies saved, archived, or random chapters posted in obscure discussion threads, I would really appreciate it. If there are any more by her that aren't on AO3 or this list, please comment below. Of course, if you know the author is strongly opposed to sharing copies of these, then you can ignore this. These include:

1.  Enticingly (I only have the first 6 chapters)
2.  Divine
3.  Sick, Sweet Song
4.  Incendiary
5.  Ideology
6.  Discorporate
7.  Death Eaters
8.  Horcrux
9.  Getting Lost, Unsuccessfully
10. Gray Winds
11. Calligraphy
12. Undesirable
13. Resurrection

Thank you!


** Enticingly is on FF2

** Do you have an ao3 account? Her bio says “Most of my fics are locked, so you will have to log in to see them/read them. They aren't gone!”

I don't actually see most of the ones you listed -but there is always a chance she renamed some.

*** I've read all of her locked Ao3 fics.

DLP says all of the ones I listed have different summaries from the ones on Ao3, so she definitely didn't just rename them.

I just read her Tumblr posts and she says she might take up Enticingly, Divine, and Incendiary again after she's done with some of her other projects, so there's hope I guess.

** [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPSlashFic/comments/j2s89w/lf_obsidianpen_stories/]] has all of them (and more), except for Horcrux, Gray Winds, Undesirable, and Resurrection (if anyone also has those, I'm still looking)
