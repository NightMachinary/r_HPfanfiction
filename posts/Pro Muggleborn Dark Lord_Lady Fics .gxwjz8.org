I just read Hermione Granger and the marriage law revolution and got struck with desire to read similar fanfictions. Do you know any similar stories in wich an individual or group of individuals work to destroy purebloods and further muggleborns?


** linkao3(15449145) has a Gryffindor Tom Riddle who fights for Muggleborn rights and his organization is called the Death-Eaters and James & Sirius are with Tom Riddle.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...
