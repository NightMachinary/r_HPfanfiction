I do love a Good Bashing. Although, I'd prefer that the Twins be on Harry/Hermione's side.

What are your favs?


** There's a lot I could list but

Champions of the Founders and Hogwarts Champions show it

And if you're good with creepypasta crossovers just read pretty much any of them for at least Dumbledore bashing

** My go-to bashing guilty pleasure fics are usually the works of Sinyk. Both linkffn(three to backstep; Harry Potter and the daft morons) are pretty solid for what they are

*** I end up pulling up Daft Morons every couple months, but I just can't seem to finish it. The bashing just gets too horrible, and the Harry of the fic is probably the biggest asshole out of all the Harrys on FFN.

**** Oh, I don't really disagree, but OP wanted bashing, and it's definitely a bashing fic.

Three to Backstep is actually pretty okay for as much as it bashes though

***** Can't comment on the other fic, I avoid independant!Harry fics with Daphne in the pairing like the plague. Sinyk makes his fics relatively nice for the cliches he chooses (or at least the few of his fics that I've read through) so I'm sure it's decent, but I just can't stand the version of her that stars in indie fics.
