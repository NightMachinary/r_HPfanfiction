:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember a short one-shot where the DA are in the Room of Requirement and the main characters (or one of them) announce they discovered that pain and suffering while growing up (for a magic-user) strengthen the magical core, that the original (forgotten) purpose of the Cruciatus was to stimulate development in children.

They then go on to justify Dumbles' actions with this.

Does anyone remember this fic?

Can anyone suggest any other fics with this idea?


** I don't know of that exact fic, but there's the linkffn(All Full of that Wizard Angst by CalamityJim) oneshot that's pretty funny.
