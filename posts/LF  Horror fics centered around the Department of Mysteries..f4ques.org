Are there any fics that deal with how brains are obtained in the thought chamber, and whether those brains are taken from actual, living persons. Furthermore, in the Time chamber where one death-eater's head was reduced to infancy ( OotP ) and whether time can be slowed down or not. Coming to Death chamber, there can be experiments involving souls and dementors. The possibilities are endless.


** Here's an OOTP horror fanfic where Harry gets trapped in the Department of Mysteries alone and has to fight off the Death Eaters with a Time Turner. Spoiler: it ends well for no one.

*** I don't think any of VotN's fics end well. They write horror and gory exceptionally well.
