He suffers headaches, dizziness, vertigo, fatigue, memory problems, trouble concentrating, sleeping problems, insomnia, restlessness, irritability, apathy, depression, anxiety, personality changes, and sensitivity to noise and light.

Bonus points if he pulls a /Memento/ and/or /Vengeance/ and uses Polaroids to help him with his memories.


** you know, if everyone doesn't suffer all of these symptoms, half of this sounds like the apathetic canon Harry people are always complaining about in this sub.

**** I'm pretty sure most people with post-concussion syndrome don't have all the symptoms, but I would like to see this prompt with a mix that more shows a concussion than just apathetic. Not that I mind apathetic either.

***** I have post concussion syndrome, and I have all these symptoms. It's common to have all of them, especially if it went for a while untreated.

** I have post-concussion syndrome, I've had it ever since I got a concussion in 2014. The symptoms get better, but they haven't truly gone away.

I would appreciate something like this a lot. It seems to me that nobody in fiction really appreciates the impact of a concussion and takes them rather lightly.

In /Elementary/, Sherlock Holmes is actually diagnosed with Post-Concussion Syndrome in season 6, even though he "recovers" by season 7.

***** I agree with you on the quick recovery bit, although Sherlock does note that he's one concussion away from being turned into a vegetable after he "recovers".

But yeah, it's a fun show, and also the only one I know of that deals with Post-Concussion Syndrome.

** Did harry ever get any concussions though? It takes a lot of force to the head to cause one, and I dont think Dudley ever hit him that hard. His cousin was a bully, not a sadist.

*** You don't need to actually black out to have a concussion; any time your brain gets rattled around in your skull, you're having a concussion, and a lot of minor concussions can be just as bad as a few major ones.
