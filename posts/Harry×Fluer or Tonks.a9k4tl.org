LinkFFN(The Dark Lady Tonks)

LinkFFN(Cadmean Victory)

LinkFFN(Allure Immune Harry) - Not 100K but funny

LinkFFN(Harry Potter and the Black Hearted Auror) - Harry Tonks, only 50K

LinkFFN(Harry Potter and the Summer of Change) - 300K

LinkFFN(Honks)

LinkFFN(Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool) 77K, plus there is another two chapters or so on the sequel on the authors page

LinkFFN(Whispers in the Night)

LinkFFN(Whats a little death between friends) - 79K

LinkFFN(The Merging)

​

Admittedly not all of these meet the length Requirements, but these are the HarryxFleur, HarryxTonks, HarryXBoth or Multi with those two. Hope there are a few you haven't read and can enjoy. The shorter ones I included because I really enjoyed them despite being shorter.

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

#+begin_quote
  In the summer prior to fifth year, Andromeda Tonks finds out her daughter Nymphadora has set her sights on Remus Lupin. She's not happy with this, and tricks Tonks into going for Harry Potter instead. What starts out as a way to "get back" at her parents, turns into an uncommon romance... Canon until the start of Book 5 'Order of the Phoenix', mild lemons. / No updates, on hold.

  Words have more power than we think. Thoughts & dreams can be revealed to those closest to us, to those we want to know more of, & to our greatest enemies. A single act of kindness, a single word can change someone's entire world. Join Harry on another adventure through his time at Hogwarts where even the quietest whispers can make a difference. Harry/Multi. Mature for a reason.

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?

- Attractive woman

- Opens options for creativity with French/continental magical community

Not all of those do it for me but fics like linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter--the-Wastelands-of-Time]]) and linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived]]) opened the door for me on her as a viable character.

*** Personally I think Fleur (and Tonks) make a lot more sense than somebody like Cho for Harry's first crush. Older, flirty, beautiful, they check all the right boxes for it and I think it's realistic for Harry to end up with somebody older and more emotionally mature based on the life he lived. I think he would very much want that kind of stability. Katie Bell is another character that I think checks enough of the boxes that it would be interesting to seem somebody really develop that character as a genuine love interest for Harry.

  Katie Bell

It's actually quite difficult to write her as love interests without sounding like you are creating a "better" Ginny.

***** Hmm I think there's plenty of avenues to pursue: Maybe she has other interests besides Quidditch? Maybe she isn't even that big into Quidditch and just does it, because her father wants her to play (wow, such character development)? Maybe she's generally aloof and likes to play hard to get (ice queen of Gryffindor?). Maybe she has a huge shoe collection or is secretly way more into makeup than Lavender&Parvati and scoffs at their terrible fashion sense? Or maybe she's a huge space nerd and has every book by Carl Sagan + a VHS set of Cosmos?

I feel like people are sometimes just afraid to invest in their characters, especially when they are love interests. You could probably just throw a dart at a board of characteristics and just force yourself to commit to wherever it lands and build on that.

****** The issue is not committing to characters. I've made several attempts, but it's pretty difficult to come up with an in-depth character who is, to a certain degree, original.

And once you have written a few stories, you begin to run into the issue of having used the characterisation. I don't want to write Katie Bell like, for example, Penelope Clearwater from Dawn of Darkness, or Pansy Parkinson from Accidentally Married.

**** I always imagined Harry having a little crush on Tonks too. And she's all that much older than Harry either, I can well imagine a single Harry and a single Tonks mucking about a little after Harry's left Hogwarts.

**** I like Katie as a school fling or one shot character, but I think she lacks the depth to be a good character in a focused romantic fic. To me her entire character is fun and engaging enough for the reader to be invested in the relationship, but she won't form a deep enough romantic partnership with him to prevent the inevitable breakup. For me she's the perfect first relationship girl for Harry.

***** I don't disagree with you, but I also don't feel like that argument holds a ton of weight because Ginny also lacks that depth.

*** Honestly I have read quite a few fanfics and I like how people adapt and change her character. She also has a ton of potential that wasnt used in the books.
