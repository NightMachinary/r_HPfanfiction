It kinda seems to me that the vast majority of fics that I've read have been written by Malfoy - in regards to Hagrid's characterisation, obviously.

Therefore - are there any fics where Hagrid is portrayed like in canon, or maybe even better? I would love to have him play a bigger role in the plot too (moreso than in canon).

Thanks!


** I mean, obligatory linkffn(Lesson With Hagrid) recommendation is obligatory, but that's not very much. The thing with Hagrid is that everybody loves him in theory, but he's terribly hard to write; first because of his accent, which, like all phonetically-spelled accents, is a pain; second because it's very hard to find him a decent place in a plot.

  "Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?" ...Snape kicks Harry out of 'Remedial Potions', but as we know from The Philosopher's Stone, there is another Occlumens in the school good enough to keep out the Dark Lord. Stupid oneshot.

** I'd like something where 3rd year Harry gets a letter from Hagrid that there's a surprise when he gets to school. After the events of The Chamber of Secrets, Hagrid's name is cleared. He gets a new wand and restarts school as a 3rd year.

** He's a more important support character, and gets more respect, though still not really in the spotlight, in linkffn(The Snape Chronicles).

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

  Falling through puddles and magic gone haywire are just a few of Harry's newest problems. With the Ministry falling apart and Voldemort unearthing ancient secrets, will Harry uncover the truth in time? Post-OotP.
