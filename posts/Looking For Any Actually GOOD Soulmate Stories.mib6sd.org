I understand that the trope is laden with trash, and that it is generally derided as one of the worst tropes offered, but it is, to me, a sound concept in and of itself and I'd like to see if anyone knows of any actually well written ones. I am looking for oneshots or complete multi-chapters. Any pairing is acceptable but no slash please. Additionally, I'd be curious to see if anyone is aware of any /platonic/ soulmate stories that have been written. Thanks in advance!

** This fic is a series of interconnected one-shots. Your soulmate has your scars. All the chapters are really good usually end in a plot twist or heartbreak, and even has a couple of platonic soulmates. I definitely recommend that you read the whole thing, but these are my favorite. In order!

WHY DO PEOPLE LIKE TO WRITE ANGST SO MUCH

[Angry Rant about angst]

From one side you have a bunch of fics that are basically unreadable and from the other you have excellent quality writing... but it's fucking angst-y bullshit where everyone fucking dies in the end. What was the fucking point of the story if everyone fucking dies. I want to read fanfiction to escape reality not to be brutally reminded of it. So damn often you are reading a very good fic and then from nowhere BAM, surprise angst! Why, why why why? "Because teenagers have angst issues ;)" Well that's not a good fucking answer. WHAT DOES IT PROVIDE TO THE NARRATIVE TO HAVE SO MUCH ANGST? Usually nothing. It's just there to slow it down. To put rifts in the character's friendships because why the fuck not. What's the point of it all.

[\Angry Rant]

tl;dr : I don't understand why people like to add needless angst that, most of the time, doesn't add /anything/ other than angst to the narrative.

**** Some people /like/ angst.

It's like asking, ‚Äúwhy do people keep adding all this sex that, most of the time, doesn't add /anything/ other than sex most of the time?‚Äù Probably, the answer is ‚Äúyou're reading porn, and the sex is the point.‚Äù

Action movies have a lot of pointless bullshit too, because the bullshit is the point.

Most stories are just burritos filled with whatever the author and audience think is cool and want to see, with a tortilla of non-cool elements to keep them together.

**** I tentatively both agree and disagree. Sometimes I just like to read sad stories, I find it better to feel sad about fiction stuff than while I get over whatever was making me sad in the first place.

That said, I absolutely despise it when authors load up otherwise decent fics with a boatload of angst. One of the things that will make me close a fic instantly is any kind of graphic abuse from the Durselys, or any character having one of those spiralling depression mental monologues about how pathetic they are and how they're a failure and they should leave for the good of everyone else.

** The Meaning of One does quite a good job IMO because it gives depth to all the characters around Harry and Ginny, exploring their reactions in a realistic way. The closest to an antagonist is Molly Weasley, who is quite upset by what's happened to her little girl and tries to put some distance between Harry and Ginny, but even then it's clear that she's driven by genuine love and concern, although she makes mistakes. Harry and Ginny aren't perfect, either, and definitely make some missteps, but it's really nice to see them constantly back each other up and support each other. And since they're ten and eleven, it basically is platonic.

Books one and two are complete, though it seems like there won't be more.
