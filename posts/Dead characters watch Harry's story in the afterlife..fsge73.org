:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It's been years since I read this fic, but I remember it fairly clearly. It's basically a story of all the characters who die in canon getting together and watching Harry's story play out on a TV. It's starts with Lily and James, and as each character dies they join the group to watch the rest of the story.

I'm pretty sure the afterlife is depicted as a town where everyone lives out their second "life", and somehow Lily and James discover that their TV allows them to watch Harry as he goes through Hogwarts.

It probably would have been on ffn since I almost exclusively read from there around the time I found this story. I can't remember the name for the life of me and I never saved it. If someone can help me track it down I'd love to read it again.

Edit: thanks to [[/u/Namzeh011][u/Namzeh011]], I was able to find the story I was looking for.

  Vague spoilers for PS-HBP. One-shot. James Potter observes as Harry arrives to an alternate dimension where his parents are alive and Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived. Trying to teach old cliches new tricks, here.

*** Unfortunately not. I remember very clearly that everything in the story is canon (other than the obvious).

Your suggestion does sound interesting enough that I'll probably read it anyway, so thanks for that!

  What if Sirius had the other two-way mirror on him when he died and Harry found that he was able to talk to his godfather and parents though it? Not to mention, meet all those others who went before? "Sirius Black? Sirius Black!" "Pads, is that your pocket talking to you?" "I dunno, but it sounds like...no way, it couldn't have been there the whole time...Harry!"

***** Actually, this might be it! I wouldn't be surprised if I misremembered a bunch of details, but the way this starts out seems very familiar. I'll check back once I've read further. Thanks a bunch!
