Been looking for this fic for some time, can't remember it's name, but was heavy smut don't know if it was deleted by the author or something. The chapters alternated between Fleur and Hermione smut but chapter 1 was Harry/Fleur. Anyone know the name and link?

*** A good one but no. No power sharing ritual stuff in the one I'm looking. Remember, it was Harry Fleur and Hermione period

*** No. Thanks but not the one. Read it, and it's not the one. The one I'm looking for starts after Fleur's wedding I think and there at the barrow. Second chapter is with Hermione In a library

<tongueincheek> I don't think I've ever read a scene where the characters go at it with dead bodies around.

** "Accio Ballgag" on Archive. Fleur is a sex therapist, Hermione is not satisfied with Harry due to curse damage from Voldemort. Lots of smut, pretty over the top, and a bottom Harry.

*** Nope. Good author but still not him. I'm starting to think whoever posted (trust me, it was big pile of steaming hot smut, best I've ever read that focused solely on Fleur and Hermione with lots of chapters) must have deleted it. It was pretty easy to find usually whenever you wrote Fleur Harry lemons
