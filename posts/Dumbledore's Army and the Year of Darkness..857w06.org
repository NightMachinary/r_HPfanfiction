I know the author deleted the story, but I have a link to a zip archive and PDF for anyone who messages me.


** Meta question/comment:

I frequently find myself wondering why threads of this sort aren't against Rule 6.

*** The author apparently went insane so it's impossible to know if this violates his right-minded wishes or not.

***** Err... some people on here would know better than me but I think, roughly, he claimed to be the next Messiah, got people to donate loads of money, set up a camp somewhere where he slept with his followers wives, raised more money for a pilgrimage to New Zealand, got to New Zealand with his followers and abandonned them all in the forest but took their money, tried to do the same again, got called out on it, had a hissy fit, deleted his stories but kept the reviews running, then fled to Europe or something.

That may be partly wrong but it was years ago and I can only vaguely remember.

***** He didn't go insane. He deleted his fanfiction and fandom related activites because of personal reasons regarding his future career. I was a friend before he culled his facebook, and I was involved with the DAYD facebook group.
