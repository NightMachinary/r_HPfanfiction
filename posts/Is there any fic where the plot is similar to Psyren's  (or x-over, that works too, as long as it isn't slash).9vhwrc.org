#+TITLE: Is there any fic where the plot is similar to Psyren's ? (or x-over, that works too, as long as it isn't slash)

For those that don't know what Psyren is, its a manga with the following premise: A group of "somewhat" random people go through a triage using a public phone card that sends them to a wasteland with weird shit and monsters, and they have to find a public payphone in this wasteland to go back to their realm. However, prolonged exposure to this wasteland's atmosphere unlocks ESP abilities. They eventually find out that this "wasteland" is actually the future and they're being sent there to find out what happened and to find a way to prevent it.

Meaning, No paradoxes, abilitiy to go forth and back in time, chance to rewrite the future, ESP abilities.

I know there's that Lone Traveler fic, but I disliked it, as did Circular Reasoning and Wastelands of Time. (Granted, I didn't read all these 3 fics past the first 2 chapters, so I may be wrong in saying they're similar, but that's what I remember from the premise of them.)
