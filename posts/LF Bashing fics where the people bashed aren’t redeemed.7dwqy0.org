I want fics where if a character is bashed and made out to be the bad guy they don't have a change of heart or see the error of their ways and are bashed to the end. I'd prefer AU fics that aren't just plot regurgitation, but I'll take what I can get.

Dark Harry and slash are fine. Please no harems, smut/romance-centric plot (though romance is okay), pottercest, genderbending or mpreg. Thank you!


** ...Isn't that /most/ bashing fics? It's a bashing fic that actually redeems the character that I would call unusual.

*** I see a fair few fics where, especially if Harry's sent to Azkaban, Hermione ends up redeemed

**** Yeah, but those aren't really bashing Hermione, are they? She's just taken in by the flow of things that send Harry to prison, for the sake of the plot, but the author doesn't bash her /personally/ beyond that.

***** I dunno. When he comes back she always refuses to stop meddling and poking her nose in his business until he shows he's not showing mercy. That seems pretty bashy

**** Hermione ends up redeemed whatever she does. Betrayed Harry and killed his entire familly? It's okay... she probably had a valid reason, she is the most annoyin... smart witch her generation.

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.

  James sacrificed himself to save his wife and son. Sirius took them into hiding and trained Harry the Marauders way. Neville became the BWL. That doesn't mean that he's the Chosen One. This is a AU story. Harry/Ginny MA Rating

** Who would want to bash a? It's the first letter of the alphabet and pretty important. If you're going to bash a letter, I'd suggest q. That lame-o would be nothing without u.
