Ok hopefully I will explain this correctly. There are three types of time travel. Fixed Timeline is what we see in the books, excluding Cursed Child (do I still need spoiler tags for this? It's been several months...). So Hermione knows that she needs to throw rocks into Hagrid's window because she already did it, and Harry knows that he can cast a Patronus because he saw himself do it, etc. Then you have dynamic time travel, which is what you see in Cursed Child, where changing things in the past directly changes you present/future (like the whole making people not be born). Then you have multiverse, which is what we see in most fanfiction, where travel back in time causes a split in the timeline, with a whole new potential future. With multiverse, the time traveler either goes back with the specific intention of changing things, or spends the whole story trying to maintain the timeline.

What I am looking for is a fic that deals with a fixed timeline, where the character goes back, but every time they try to change something they end up being the catalyst that makes the event happen. I can only remember seeing one fic like this, and I can't remember the name of it to save my life. The one I read is Harry centric, and the part I specifically remember is about Peter. Harry goes back to the 70's, Peter is actually a decent guy, but Harry hates him for betraying his parents, finally snaps and confronts Peter, ends up beating the crap out of the kid because Peter won't tell him why he would betray his friends. In the end, Peter finally agrees to betray his friends if only Harry will not kill him... And Harry realised that he basically broke Peter, and that the beating Harry just doled out was what caused Peter to betray the Potters in the first place...

Anyways, fixed timeline is really hard to write, and I'm sure there aren't a lot of them, but if anyone can toss me a few suggestions, I would appreciate it. :-)


** Oh man I have so many of these to rec. IIRC you read slash and het so I'll include some of both.

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5846417/1/Choices][Choices by Aebbe]] - This is an awesome time-travel fic. In this fic, Lily Luna travels back in time and meets the marauders and then sirius travels forward to 2028. This whole fic is canon-compliant but reveals a ton of stuff that we thought happened in canon as not quite as it seemed. The romance is good and the interactions with all of the different characters is funny and interesting too. I loved the characterizations of all the next-gen kids and the time travel is really well done. Linkffn(5846417)

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/670548][The Boy Who Died a Lot]] - This fic is really really creative and a great read! If you're not a Snarry fan then just skip the coda which is the only part with any graphic Snarry. The rest is a really cool fic that takes Snape saving Harry all the time to the next level.

The basic premise is that during Harry's first year, he dies during the detention in the forbidden forest with Draco. Because dumbledore knows the prophecy, and knows Harry can't die (yet...) he gives Snape a time turner and puts him in charge of saving Harry. There's a Final Destination twist where fate keeps trying to kill Harry (I think he dies 20 times from Rons broken wand in second year for example) and Snape just keeps saving him. It has cool time travel and interesting time loop things with multiple snapes. It's also canon-compliant (EWE) which is rare for most hogwarts era slash - especially Snarry. Linkao3(670548)

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/936002][If Only I Could Turn Back Time]] - This is a HP/DM time travel fic where Harry and Draco accidentally travel back in time years rather than days. They end up in 1991 - their first at hogwarts - and have to figure out how to get back. The time travel parts were good and the author used the causal paradox really skillfully. However I am really neutral on this fic. The author desperately needed a Beta as well as less cliches. Almost every Harry Draco relationship cliche is in here - seeker games, oblivious Harry, bed sharing, fighting turning to kissing etc. Even the smut was so unbelievably unoriginal - I felt like I had already read that scene before because it's so similar to others. Linkao3(936002)

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/10772496/1/The-Debt-of-Time][The Debt of Time]] - this is a MONSTER of a fic - 750K+ words! Don't let the length put you off though, it is in four parts so you can break it up if it is too daunting. In this fic, Hermione brings Sirius back from beyond the veil the summer before 7th year. He joins the trio on their Horcrux hunt and a lot of things are different in the war because he is there, although the same story beats are all there. After the war, Hermione goes back in time (on the order of herself from the past) and re-lives her years at hogwarts with the Marauders. She is adopted by the Potters and is raised as James' sister with the nickname Mia (pronounced maya - that misspelling drove me nuts through the entire fic!!). The Hogwarts years are long and beautifully written, but I found myself dying to find out what would happen when she returned to 1998! It took all my willpower not to just skip ahead. This fic does a great job using canon time travel, and hermione is very frustrated that she can't change the future and also that she causes some of the bad things to happen. Linkffn(10772496)

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2637458][Brevem Conspectum]] - In this fic Harry time travels forward 8 years to a life where he is married to Draco and very happy. It is that glimpse that encourages him to pursue Draco when he gets back to the present. It's kinda like how Harry can cast the Patronus because he already did it, in this he knows to pursue Draco because he already did. linkao3(2637458)

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8315797/1/Gray-Skye-Mourning][Grey Skye Mourning]] - In this fic, Harry goes back in time to save Snape right after the battle at hogwarts. He meets his parents and dumbledore in the past and they all know he is from the future, but they do not ALL know who he is. He falls in love with Snape in the past and has to try to save him in the future from dying in the shrieking shack. He cannot try to save his parents or anyone else who died though because everything that has happened will still happen, even when he is in the past. The coolest thing about this story is how Harry back in the past MADE some things that happened in the future happen. Linkffn(8315797)

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1875756][Tempus]] - I loved this fic and definitely wasn't expecting to based on the summary. Most basically, it's an EWE canon-compliant, tightly written, time travel fic with a (somewhat) believable Harry/OC romance (the Draco in this is our Draco's great grandfather). Also there's an awesome mystery, a bunch of action and other plotty awesomeness. The description of the Slytherin common room was also unique and unusual. Without giving away spoilers, this fic does use the causal loop time travel really well. Linkao3(1875756).

*** This is fantastic!!! Thank you so much!! You're right, I read both het and slash :-) I've only read one of these (Grey Sky Morning, amazing fic, totally worth a re-read, lol), and Debt of Time and The Boy Who Died a Lot are on my reading list, but I hadn't even heard of any of the rest! This is going to keep me busy for at least a few weeks! /happy dance/ Thanks again!!

  Did you ever wonder where the Hogwarts disappearing corridors go--or when? When Harry Potter finds himself at Hogwarts in 1927 he never expected that the first person he would run into would be... Draco Malfoy?? 85,000 words. Written for the "hp_cliche" challenge in 2006, run by ReganV. Beta-read by Miraba. Harry is magically transported back to Hogwarts in 1926, and until they find a way to return him to 1997, he is enrolled as a student. The very first student he meets is a blond Slytherin named Draco Malfoy. A time without Voldemort gives Harry the chance to learn things about magic and himself, but that era is not without certain evils. Mixes mystery, romance, action/adventure, and first-time smut. Nominated for a Multi-faceted Award. Additional warnings: Corporal punishment, teacher/student, consensual BDSM as well as dubious consent, torture, alcohol consumption.

** Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality

I understand that some people don't like it, but I do, and its definitely in large part to the use of fixed timeline time travel in the fic.

I'm a huge fan of fixed timelines in time travel. It's what sold me on Harry Potter in the first place (wasn't feeling the series too much until after the time turner popped up).

I tend to explain the three times of time travel as closed loop (fixed timeline) being what happened in Harry Potter or the first Terminator (Lost used more than one type but it did some cool stuff with closed loop time travel), open loop (dynamic timeline) as what happened in Back to the Future, and multiple universe as what happened in Dragonball Z.

Lastly, your username (and, I assume, your last name, since we share what I assume is the same first initial) is only two letters off of mine (not on this site but on several others). We both seem to love fixed timeline time travel, so I have to ask, are you me from the future? It might explain why you haven't been able to find the fic you mentioned (because it hasn't been written yet). Maybe you traveling back in time and mentioning it is what causes it to be written in the first place.
