I just realized how much I want a fic like this.


** The all famous "Seventh Horcrux", linkffn(10677106), certainly does that. The entire plot is about the seventh Horcrux messing around with Voldemort. He also had to kill the first Horcrux (Diary):

/You stop this nonsense and get back in your diary, young man./

....

/It was a necessary evil. I had enough competition without another me running around./

** The closest is in how Harry Dursley and the Chronicles of the King, most horcruxes are active.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8770795/1/Harry-Dursley-and-The-Chronicles-of-the-King]]

It's amazing, but has a rather confusing plot, in that everyone is an individual agent, ie. Playable Character not NPC, so everyone's making waves. It's complicated, but I like it.

** I guess this is a spoiler, but it looks like things were headed that way in linkffn(Magical Relations by evansentranced). Unfortunately, the fic hasn't updated in ~9 months.

In linkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarCat) Voldemort is resurrected more than once from different horcruxes, but they don't fight each other.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  In which Tom Riddle devises a diabolical plot to usurp the main soul piece, Lord Voldemort, and the Boy-Who-Lived mysteriously vanishes on his eleventh birthday. Or, where Tom hates everything but tolerates his fellow horcruxes plus his arch-nemesis in order to take over the world... if things would only go his way.A drabble series told in snippets of 100, because nothing else properly conveys the absurdity of this situation.This work now has a guide with extra information and explanations.
