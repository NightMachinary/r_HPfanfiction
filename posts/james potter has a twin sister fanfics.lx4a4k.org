In this fic Hermione gets sent back in time during the Battle of Hogwarts as James Potters twin sister. She has memories of both lives but sometimes it's difficult for her to differentiate, though she remembers the main things like James and Lily will die.

Tbh I didn't finish it because I thought the authors portrayal of some of the characters was too OOC and just weird

  Hermione's destiny is altered by the Powers that Be. She is cast back to the Marauder's Era where she is Hermione Potter, the pureblood fraternal twin sister of James Potter. She retains Hermione Granger's memories, and is determined to change her brother's fate for the better. Obviously AU. Starts in their 1st year. M for language, minor violence, etc.

** "Potter | Sirius Black" by TinaX2 on wattpad, it has 2 sequels, "Muggle" And "Crookshanks". "Potter" and "Crookshanks" have a OC/Sirius Black pairing, the OC is James' twin sister, Potter is marauder era while Crookshanks is normal timeline. Muggle is the 2nd book, and has an OC /Fred Weasley pairing, it has to be read after Potter in order to understand what happens in crookshanks. The storys have a lot of chapters and I like the writing. Im going to link the author so that you can find her works :

** Bit out there, but Debt of Time is one where James has a twin. It's very sexually explicit, just a heads up.

  When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner.
