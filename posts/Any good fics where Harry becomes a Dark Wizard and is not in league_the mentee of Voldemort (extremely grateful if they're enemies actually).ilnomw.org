Two additional requests if possible:

1. Harry is actually portrayed as evil and toxic for the people around him and not some Lord Hadrian Whatever Self-Insert.
2. He gets defeated by the good guys eventually. Even if he might be presented in a sympathetic way, I still would like him to be the villain and the good to triumph at the end.

Thank you.


** Love the concept, Realignment by PuzzleSB would fit.
