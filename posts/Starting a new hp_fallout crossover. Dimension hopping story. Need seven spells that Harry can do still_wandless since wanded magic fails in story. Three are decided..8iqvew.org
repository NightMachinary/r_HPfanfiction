Right now I'm thinking animagus charm(sirius can transform in prison, obviously a wand isn't required), Apparation[fast travel basically](harry apparates to the top of his school as a kid), and legilemency(albus allegedly does it when his eyes twinkle[though twinkling eyes are also a sign of sexual arousal due to a thickening of the liquid on the eye as one squints ever so slightly to better look at their lust target]) are three of the spells he can reliably perform wandlessly. What should the other four be? Disarming? It's basically Harry's signature spell and could be well practiced enough to be viable as wandless for him. I'm thinking a sensory deprivation hex too, maybe.

In:

Apparate

Legilimens

Sensory Deprivation Curse

Potential:

Animagus

Confounding spell

Disarming

Disillusionment

Stunning


** Personally I wouldn't classify the animagus transformation as a charm although that may be due to fanon infecting me

**** Transfiguration uses spells, not charms. According to JKR, charms add properties to things, Transfiguration simply changes properties that are already there (it's even in the name, "change figure").

Anyway, there is a big difference with the Animagus spell: it let's you mostly keep your human intellect intact (although your emotions are somewhat simplified). Transfiguring yourself or others into animals by any other means will give you the actual mind of such an animal.

** I know it can be annoying when people question the premise, but why does wanded magic fail? All wands do is focus and enhance one's magic, so if the user can use their magic I wonder why the wand would fail (unless Harry just doesn't have it). Something to remember even though wands fail is that Ollivander says beings with magic an channel their magic into anything, so that opens some avenues in Fallout. Like, magic channeled into bullets perhaps?

Anyway, to actually answer what you asked, a obvious one would be the Shield Charm. A lot of fanfic authors mistakenly believe the Shield Charm only blocks spells, but they didn't read canon closely. The charm creates an invisible wall - usually around the user but it can be put wherever they want - which will block physical objects (people, projectiles, etc) as well. Could be useful in keeping off radiation when going through irradiated places.

Maybe the Blasting Curse (Confringo) as well for a powerful explosive magic. Hell, Pettigrew blew up a whole street with it and explosives are indispensable in Fallout. The Water-Making Charm (Aguamenti) is also a good one.

Maybe. I wouldn't mind Harry being somewhat OP, but I've gone through phases where I immediately dropped such stories I admit.

Best case for this story would be no wands nearby to access. Just simplifies things believably.

** I'd fall back on the basics of what is seen in accidental magic:

- telepathy (Legilimency)

- telekinesis (accio and depulso, maybe leviosa)

- self-transfiguration (includes Animagus charm, hair-restoration, becoming rubberized for temporary resistance to damage from moving objects like Bludgers and the ground)

- opening apertures (apparition, water summoning, incendio, that hot wind drying charm, Vanishing).

The limits will be much shorter range, much less control, and no special features; can't apparate to a place just by coordinates or seeing a picture of it; can't unVanish; may have problems turning off the water/fire/air)

** High concepts distilled.

General mild slow telekinesis as opposed to acco/leviosa/whatever. Cease function as opposed to stupefy.

This allows you more leeway in what you do and how you limit what you do. For instance, you could grab bullets out of the air with telekinesis but you need to know where they are which is basically impossible, you also wouldn't be able to slow them down enough and can't move them faster than like a foot per second or some such like that. Cease function would normally end consciousness in a living target or some minor chemical property in an inanimate one, however you can basically just gm fiat that to be as weak or powerful as you want to do basically whatever you want. It makes a wonderful checkhovs gun and everything.

Remember that in hp and most of the better end of modern urban fantasy works in higher concepts twisting or limiting them until there is balance.

If you're doing a crossover remember to take advantage of all the settings. I once wrote an omake for a dc crossover where I nerfed avada kedavera by using fiat of the endless. You are using fallout and he elder scrolls, one of which has bullshit science that makes things of the wonky wacky zany gory grossness and another that has a huge and developed cosmology and mythos. Like, the stars were not aligned is a perfect reason for Wanda not to work in the elder scrolls mythos. Blame it on radiation being related to oblivion and that the pervasive nature of the energies of oblivion interferes with a wands connection to aetherius and it's wielded o some shit.

Magibabble, technobabble makes stories greater.

Remember,bee that the second you thought this up it became an au. There are things different from what has been shown and things never thought of. Don't try too hard to make things “canon” at the expense of good storytelling.

Eh, as for what Magics to use?

I would reccomend small magics. Cantrips really, faster regen (days not seconds), glitterdust (flashy distracting irritant), minor mental things like sensory deprivation or balance impairment. I would also reccomend both a flashy powerful spell like sectumsempra or fiendfyre or something alongside something minor and conceptual that is as powerful as you can use your intellect and creativity to make it like nasuverse reinforcement or wuxia walking and breathing.

Uh... Oh yeah, conceptuals, they are a blast to write and make balance easy. I reccomend conceptuals always.

As for the alternate for the curse, try the point me spell.

The other spells/abilities on the list makes it too easy for your Potter as well. Try to make it so that the minimal magic that Potter has access to is limited to the first to 3rd/4th year spells. That will make yhinkgs a lot more interesting.

** I noticed people here giving real good advice, and a lot on how to limit Harry. But Harry to me is the rush-headfirst-into-danger kind of guy, but when he needs to, he can be rather crafty. Try and use the hp spells in new ways instead: augumenti charm for water? Yeah that shit pulls water particles from the air to give you water. And since everything is radioactive? That spell is going to give you iradiated water. Perhaps the radiation messes with the wands and any spell with a wand go horribly wrong?

Animagus: good for sneakyness, but he could also get into a lot of hillarious situations with it.

Canonwise his strengths would be; expelliarmus, accio, stupify and expectro patronum. Stupify could be worthless against anything but humans. Accio could be dangerous-summoning sharp objects towards himself. Patronus could only work against ghouls/undead perhaps. Or it could momentarily clense and area from radioactivity.

Make an op strong Harry. Then take away his wand for a good reason. Then make his spells be all wonky, or not work right, and make us laugh at his confusion of why his wandless magic doesnt do what it is supposed to do. Perhaps make it a learning curve. So he has to come up with new ways for his magic to work.

** I think the real issue is we're trying to think of magic as problem solving tools, when really magic should create more problems than it helps solve. Characters should not have spells that just fix whatever problems they're encountering. Magic should just be another tool in their arsenal that they must employ with careful thought and consideration... but more than that, magic should be something that creates problems, that can then be solved with magic. The limitations of a magic system are far more entertaining to read than the abilities of one. Take the cave scene in HBP. Harry can't use Aguamenti to summon water for Dumbledore. Why? Who knows? But it adds tension to the scene. If Harry could just say a word and Dumbledore wouldn't be thirsty anymore, and they could just sit there while he recovered, then left the cave without disturbing the inferi at all, how boring would that be? It's about as boring as stunning every enemy you meet, or anytime you want an item or information from someone and they give you a favor to perform, you just use Legilimency to retrieve the info, or you use a Confundus to get them to give you the item. Magic should not be a solution to your mundane problems -- magic should be a solution to magical problems.

** Don't count the animagus transformation, once you learn it you have it down it isn't really a spell.

But if you have e 3 already set in

Apparition

Legimancy

Sensory Deprivation Curse (don't see how this will be extremely useful)

My thoughts:

The Disarming Jinx (Harry personal knows the benefits of the spell and it would of ended most of his pre wasteland problems before they started) I would have many of the raiders use cover and the super mutants just have enough grip strength to ignore it, but it would allow him the upper hand in ambushes and double crosses.

Some kind of Severing Spell (Cutters are often one of the three basic offensive spell types in stories, Piercing and Bashing/Force spells are the other two) this gives Harry away to be handy in a pinch without being way over powered. He can cut trees down, break stuff down, perform assassinations without revealing his part in it by using a signature gun.

Muffilato, isn't as insanly broken in Fallout as the Silencing Spell would be, isn't permanent can be used on camps and on weapons.

Repairing Charm, insanely helpful while not broken, would keep him with working glasses as well as working firearms. As someone wearing glasses Reparo is probably the one spell I wish I had

I would replace the Sensory Deprivation Curse with either the Ferula or some type of small wound Sealing charm. Harry should have to conform to the world of Fallout while having some Aces, torturing people won't exactly be more useful that Sealing up a bullet wound or bracing a twisted or broken bone
