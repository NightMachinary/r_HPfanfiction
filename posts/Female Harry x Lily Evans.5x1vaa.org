*** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/12370765/1/][*/A Tale Of Two Lillies/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6664607/DylantheRabbit][/DylantheRabbit/]]

  After a disastrous battle in the Department of Mysteries that claims her life Harriet Potter is sent back in time to prevent the second rise of Voldemort. A response to Anubis' Two Lillies challenge. Rated M for adult situations and some rather fruity language. Femslash HP/LE and possibly more. Wink wink.

  Honestly it had been her desire to impress the strangely beautiful little blonde Ravenclaw that had been a good percentage of what had led her here tonight. Sure there was certainly some concern for her supposedly captured god father but most of it was a hormone driven need to get in Luna's pants. She suspected that Sirius would approve whole heartedly of her less than pure motivations in this regard.

Lines like that are the reason why I love this author.

*** I got a laugh out of [[https://twitter.com/GambleMike/status/814936463649292288][this dev response]] to someone asking if you can romance your twin in Mass Effect: Andromeda.

Personally I wouldn't have a problem with it, but it's not going to happen. Hideous amounts of violence in video games has a market, incest not so much. Save it for the niche fanfiction I guess.

***** It's a video game. I don't have any more of a problem with the virtual portrayal of it than I have with any of the other questionable things video games allow you to pretend to do.

Any discussion over having a problem with incest itself is a totally different thing.
