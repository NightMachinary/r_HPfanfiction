I will admit that I was never a fan of the Weasleys in cannon. To some, that seems odd as they played such a major role and it could be argued that Harry's world revolved around them 95% of the time. Its not that I did not appreciate the role they play in the story, or that I hate the entire family as characters, but I just was not a fan. I was always annoyed by Ron, hated the fact Harry was paired with Ginny, and found Percy/Miss Weasley as characters extremely annoying. I think the twins were really the only ones I enjoyed at times given the small roles Charlie/Bill played.

Again, I realize folks may hate this or downvote me based upon those opinions.

So, I am honestly curious about whether or not the Weasleys could have been removed from the cannon plot while keeping the story going strong and how it would affect peoples views on the plot. Perhaps replacing the roles they played via other characters. Neville becoming the 3rd member of the Trio. Harry paired with Hermione or Luna instead of Ginny. Other order members watching out for Harry. And so on and so forth.

--------------

If you can separate yourself from the Weasleys and imagine them not in cannon, how does it change things for you?

--------------

Finally... are there any interesting Fan Fiction stories that either follow cannon, or stay similar to cannon, but do not have the Weasleys involved in any way or even existing?

--------------

/EDIT:/ I have to say, I am a little disappointed at the down-voting that has gone on both of this thread, and of some of the posts in it with perfectly valid points. Even if you are in love with the Weasleys, thats no reason to blindly down-vote any post that negatively reflects them in some way, differs from your views, or provides an interesting debate on them not existing. And yet clearly that is happening. I disagree with several of the sentiments in this thread that definitely lean pro-Weasley, but the point of this is to have a discussion, so I don't blindly down-vote. If I don't agree.. i simply don't up-vote.

--------------

*EDIT 2:* I just want to clarify that the point of this was curiosity on how the cannon plot would/could operate if one removed the Weasleys. I think a lot of folks are getting hung up on the idea that it cant be cannon anymore without the Weasleys. I realize that if you take them out its no longer "cannon" realistically as they ARE who JK wrote in. *HOWEVER* the point is to imagine if they were NOT part of the cannon plot. What would or could change to keep it close to cannon. Do you feel its impossible to accomplish that. Who might sub in in their place? And so on and so forth...


** Ginny was a good girl. Unfortunately she was sacrificed in the Books by JKR so the Trio could get more spotlight. This is especially true in DH when she and Neville led the resistance at Hogwarts. 100 more pages (still shorter than OotP) in DH about her actions at Hogwarts would IMO greatly improve Ginny's popularity among readers. Many readers don't seem to appreciate characters that have lots of off screen developments. They want to be EXPLICITLY told by authors.

**** Unlike many, I don't consider Ginny a Mary Sue or some perfect character. She had significant flaws or darkness in her personality. She only APPEARED perfect in Harry's eyes, who had already become infatuated with her by the beginning of Year 6. Always remember the Books were narrated from Harry's VERY SUBJECTIVE POV. What he thought was not necessarily correct from neutral observers' POVs.

That just wasn't possible because up to this point all of the HP books had been written from Harry's perspective. It would have been terrible writing to break style like this in the middle of the last book. You just can't do that and it would have felt extremely out of place.

If you want a character to be characterized and /important/ they need to be around Harry (or you start to write Fanfiction). JKR just chickened out. People who aren't around Harry or don't interact with Harry are per se irrelevant to the HP books, because there's no connection.

It's not like Harry's limited POV is a law, a tenet, or a commandment. It's just an arbitrary rule imposed by the author, who can make exceptions anytime she wants, if she feels the exceptions can improve the overall story.

***** Well, there /was/ an exception made at the beginning of DH, with the scene at Malfoy Manor. I notice that whenever JKR shifted the action away from Harry, she tended to do it at the beginning of books: Frank Bryce at the Riddle House in GoF, Fudge in the PM's office / Bellatrix and Narcissa at Snape's house in HBP, Voldemort at Malfoy Manor in DH.

Shifting away from the action while Harry's adventure was already underway would have been a drastic change from the way she'd done things in the past - and yet I think Luna/Neville/Ginny were beloved enough by that point that it /might/ have worked.

Things certainly felt different in DH, given that the Golden Trio were no longer at Hogwarts, but the Silver Trio still were. Maybe JKR should have just pulled a /Two Towers/ and split the action up across the two separate groups, only to bring them back together at the end. And yet, public anticipation for the series' conclusion was so high, I think she just wanted to wrap DH up as quickly as possible. Pressure from her publisher and all that.

Of course you can argue that the camping trip was just badly done (agreed!), but I'm convinced that a large percentage of readers would have been even more pissed off if we suddenly got a Ginny-POV. It's just not done so late in a series and I don't think it would have made any sense.

#+end_quote

Well, yeah. Off-screen stuff feels like /unearned/ stuff.

And I agree with you about those 100 pages, but in ways that will probably earn me downvotes.

For me, my issues with Ginny stem from the fact that she didn't have a lot of plot development in the first place. What's there is very thin and has to be supplemented by a lot of fanon or Word of God crap that just doesn't exist in the main books. (Hello interviews and Twitter.)

A character that manages to be decently written through footnotes and supplemental material isn't decently written at all.

One of the biggest things that bothered me:

In later books, readers get told that she's fantastic now, it falls flat because there wasn't much room for contrast. She goes from practically unnoticed blushing damsel in distress to the "You Go Girl" see-it-from-a-million-miles-away love interest with few steps in between. She's a cardboard cutout of a cool girl, with an awesomeness that is largely told and rarely seen.

Her characterization was utterly fumbled until it was too late. Pairing her up with Harry removed what vestige of actual agency she had, making her the girl the hero rescued and then married. She's terribly written and I remain terribly unimpressed.

She's not a bad person, she's a bad character.

(And she was a passive-aggressive bully towards Fleur, which I fucking hated.)

**** From Book 2 to Book 5, Ginny had two years of off screen development, plenty of time to overcome her childish infatuation with Harry. Even as early as Book 2, Ron said Ginny was NOT herself in front of Harry.

But I agree JKR could have handled better. The main protagonist's love interest deserved more than 800 mentions, compared to his two best friends who were mentioned roughly 6000 times. As I said before, Ginny the character was SACRIFICED to make room for the Trio.

Its a Pity that those who say, Ginny deserved to be with Harry because he saved her life in 2nd year, yeah....ha, well. He did the same stuff to Hermione in 1st Year with the Troll. He was the ONLY one, who thought about Hermione and interupted the Trolls Attack, that might have crushed her. He saved Both...and actually, he saved hermione 2 times: at first at the Troll and second on the Dementors. Hmm, i would say, Hermione is the "true" damsel in Distress :) Ok, to be fair, Harry only had the chance to know Ginny better at the 2nd Year and even on that, he barely know her, she was just Rons Sister, thats all.

He had more romantic setup with Hermione, Luna or even Fleur to name a few than with Ginny.

** I'm a huge Weasley fan, but I'm always up for a bit of a thought experiment. Let's say we have an AU where the Weasleys don't exist -- say Arthur and/or Molly were killed in the early days of the war before any of the children were born -- but everything else is the same. What changes?

Well, off the top of my head...

Since it was thanks to the Weasleys that Harry found Platform Nine-and-three-Quarters; in this universe Harry misses the train to Hogwarts and is stuck at King's Cross.

After despairing for a while, and failing to get the workers at the station to understand that he should have gone on the train to Hogwarts, he remembers that Hagrid told him that if he needed anything he could send Hedwig with a letter -- and now he definitely needs something. So he writes a letter to Hagrid and sends Hedwig off.

It takes several hours before anything happens; in fact the Hogwarts Express probably reaches Hogwarts before Hedwig is able to. There's a lot of whispers on the train that this is the year Harry Potter starts Hogwarts, but nobody's seen him. When the first-years come down to the lake, Hagrid of course is on the lookout for Harry, but when he can't see him he gets worried and asks the kids whether anyone's seen Harry Potter. Which nobody has.

The Sorting ceremony is held up because Hagrid goes back to the train to see if Harry never got off it or something, and a number of the first-years follow because, hey, looking for Harry Potter, that's cool! Draco Malfoy is of course one of the kids who insists on coming along; he's still planning on checking this Potter out (and still has no idea that he has already met Harry once).

Finally, Hedwig reaches Hagrid, and the end of it all is that Dumbledore himself Apparates to London, finds Harry and gets him to Hogwarts -- but by that time the Sorting Ceremony is already an hour late, and So Harry gets even more attention where he first arrives. He's not only the Boy Who Lived, but also the Boy Who Held Up The Sorting.

He's still sorted into Gryffindor, though. A lot of people seem to think that Ron was the one who installed the anti-Slytherin feel in Harry, but thanks to Malfoy and Hagrid he didn't like the sound of Slytherin long before he set foot on the Hogwarts Express, to the scene with the Sorting Hat happens pretty much as in canon.

As school starts, Harry's a bit of a loner. He's friendly enough with his dorm-mates, Dean, Seamus and Neville, but doesn't really click with any of them; Dean and Seamus are instantly best friends and spend more time with each other, and Neville is too shy to really open up. Harry doesn't really know the Gryffindor girls that well either; the only one who really stands out is the bossy and annoying Hermione, whom he decides that he doesn't like.

Now, Harry gets a lot of attention and a lot of admirers, and since he's never "occupied" with Ron he probably has more casual acquaintances, who want to know all about him and talk about how he held up the Sorting, which really gets old after a while. Draco Malfoy tries to make friends, but Harry still remembers how he spoke about Hagrid and rejects him -- and so the two are enemies for their Hogwarts years, though without Ron to say that yes, Harry knows what a wizard's duel is, there is no midnight duel and no discovery of Fluffy.

Things get a little better when Harry joins the Quidditch team, under similar circumstances from canon. Oliver Wood and the team (which doesn't include Fred and George) become the first team Harry's part of, even if they are all older than him they become his first real friends he has that are at least close to his own age.

He still has a falling-out with Hermione, who even here goes on about how "you think this was a reward for breaking the rules, do you?", but with no Ron to get into a fight with Hermione she never misses the Halloween feast to cry in the girls' bathroom, and so Harry never fights the troll.

In fact, throughout the year Harry's completely clueless to the Philosopher's Stone plot. He doesn't hear about the Gringotts break-in, and while he does find out about Hagrid's dragon, he has no way to smuggle Baby Norbert out because there is no Charlie -- hence no detention in the Forbidden Forest and no spotting of Quirrelmort drinking unicorn blood. Norbert probably wreaks a bit of havoc before he's discovered and gets deported to Hagrid's despair, but ultimately nothing comes of it.

Harry does get his Invisibility Cloak, perhaps even discovers the Mirror Erised, but all in all, without Ron and Hermione he never finds out about the Philosopher's Stone and Quirrell gets unhindered past the defences... only to get stuck by the Mirror because he has no way to get the Stone out. In frustration, he breaks the Mirror, and when Dumbledore shows up Voldemort abandons Quirrell, who doesn't die but is shipped to Azkaban.

Second year... pretty much ends up totally different. With no Arthur Weasley to push for a Muggle-protection act, Lucius Malfor has no incentive to punish his offspring with the diary, and so the diary never comes into play in the second year. Dobby never visits Harry, and this time he actually gets to take the Hogwarts Express (to some jokes that "you're not holding up the Sorting this year, then?").

Lockhart is still the Defence teacher, but there's no Basilisk, no attacks and no real danger... second year is a pretty calm year.

Third year: No Weasleys to win the lottery and have their picture in the Daily Prophet means that Sirius Black never sees Wormtail's picture and so never escapes from Azkaban. This probably means Remus Lupin never lets himself be talked into taking a job as the Defence teacher, which means no Dementors. Looks like another eventless year for Harry.

Fourth year: Triwizard Tournament still happens, but with no Wormtail to have found Voldemort, Barty Crouch Junior is not freed by Voldemort and does not impersonate Mad-Eye Moody. so Harry does not compete in the Tournament. Cedric Diggory wins and does not die, Voldemort does not return...

...

Hmm.... Okay, Problem with removing the Weasleys is that they're so integral to the plot. The plots of both second and third year hinges on the Weasleys; remove them and the plots just don't happen. And with how different things turn out, fourth year won't be the same either and Voldemort's return won't be the same.

So if you want to follow canon, you NEED the Weasleys, or otherwise have to bend over backwards to force other characters into roles they don't fit in.

You can still tell a good story without the Weasleys, but it won't be the canon story.

*** To add to this, Harry might have developed very differently as a character. When he starts Hogwarts, he's snarky and disrespectful of authority thanks to the Dursleys. Without being basically accepted into a family, he grows up with no close emotional connections - and much more like Voldemort. He does have a better defined moral compass, but without experiencing real love for friends and his own adopted family, he turns out much more like his enemy than in canon.

*** Well, on some Points i agree, but for most part (especially the "missing Train") i disagree. As McGonagal mentions in Year 2, why no one of them sending an Owl to Hogwarts. The Train starts on Noon, circa, and arrives in the Evening at Hogwarts. So, many Hours between departure and end. I think, and Owl can take this travel faster than the Express (and as McGonagal gives the possibility about sending an Owl, she admits, that an Owl would arrive in Time)....and even IF Harry would be to late, i doubt he would be that much of a Talk-Theme in Hogwarts. Harrys "negative" impression about Hermione is "installed" by Ron and he is also the one who encourages Harry for the Rulebreaks in the first Place. Harry wouldnt have it that Bad to find friends, yes he lived in an abused Household, but since its a childbook (and maybe the "Rebellic Genes" of his Father) he befriends fast with his Gryffindor mates (after all, he would have difficulties to open up on Ron). If not the Weasleys, they would either be replaced by an other Family or things would outcome different. We never see Harrys own (first)Impression of Hermione, its adabted from Rons and changed the same time as Ron (actually, Harry makes many opinions and decisions not without Rons "agreement"). I think that it was a pure accident that Scabers joined the Weasleys, he needed Protection and a Hideout.

Since Ron doesnt encourage Harry on breaking the Rules, he doesnt have a Falling-out, maybe Harry would even develop into a decent pupil, or the Marauder genes inside him come to surface.

2nd Year, Lucious could triy to give the Book either Harry (Harry isnt Sherlock, not even he has detected, that the Book was changed) or Hermione (risky, since we can assume she would be suspicious that something is odd to it and he would know from Draco, that she is a Know-it-all) or some other of his Friends.

Many of your Points are been to much depending on the Plot being 1:1 by removing the Weasleys, which can indeed go out like this, but the possibilities are countless. All just need a Author who writes it this way

The only thing that i see in conflict is the Marauders Map, Harry obtains from the Twins....well, ok, not really. Since they never stolen it, it can still be in Filchs Office in 2nd Year. But Harry wouldnt know how to use it, unless the Map recognize that one of the Marauders is his relative and reveals its secret.

That's speculation. I don't think an owl would arrive in time. It would arrive, certainly, but McGonagall's comment seems more on the idea that "better to send an owl and be a few hours late, than to take a flying car and be spotted by every Muggle around."

And Harry's a celebrity. If he causes the Sorting to be held up, of course people are going to talk about that.

Not really, no. Reading the first book, Harry is the one who takes the initiative and Ron is the follower. The rulebreaking is done because Harry wants to, not because Ron goads him into it -- Ron doesn't do anything to dissuade him, true; he follows along quite enthusiastically. But there's this prominent fandom belief that Ron is this toxic friend who makes Harry break rules, slack off and be hostile to Hermione, and without him Harry would be a great student and befriend Hermione quicker, and that just doesn't have any basis in the characters such as they are in canon.

If anything, Harry would be SLOWER in befriending Hermione because there's no troll scene to act as a catharsis, or Ron to act as a "bridge" between them. Harry and Hermione both interact far more with Ron than they do with each other, and without him I don't think they would be anywhere near as close.

I think if there's no Ron, Hermione becomes a bit of a loner because up until Halloween NOBODY in her year can stand her with the possible exception of Neville. Ron did not influence all of Gryffindor's opinions against her; she became unpopular all on her own.

Spinning on here, Neville is the only one who seems to actually get along with Hermione at first. It makes sense; Neville is used to overbearing and bossy women, and he has no problems being told that he's doing it wrong. So Hermione and Neville might develop a stronger friendship in this world. But I don't think Hermione and Harry would.

Oh, absolutely. He would have found some other wizard family to be with, no problems there. But how likely would it be that that same wizard family ALSO won the lottery or otherwise got their picture in the Daily Prophet, which just HAPPENED to be the single issue of the Daily Prophet that Sirius got off Cornelius Fudge? (We know that they don't get newspapers in Azkaban since Fudge specifically mentions that Sirius asked for his Prophet because he missed doing the crosswords.) There are too many coincidences -- so without the Weasleys, Sirius does not discover Wormtail's whereabouts, and so he never breaks out of Azkaban.

Ugh, no. For the first part, Ron generally does not encourage Harry to break rules; Harry does that without Ron.

Second of all, Harry does not have "Marauder genes." He's so BLATANTLY unlike his father in spirit and personality that he would not develop into a new Marauder with or without the Weasleys.

Why would he? We know that his main motivation had nothing to do with Harry, he wanted revenge against Arthur Weasley, who in this AU doesn't exist. That's not to say he couldn't have had the idea to give the diary to another student for other reasons, but would he really have it at the exact same time and in the exact same way? Very unlikely.

But okay, let's say he does. Let's say he decides to get rid of the diary for fear of the Ministry raiding his house and finding some Dark artefacts, and that he decides to kill two birds with one stone and give it to a student he dislikes.

Who would he give the diary to? You mention Harry and Hermione, who would probably be the most likely candidates; certainly Draco would have complained about them both at school.

But I think you're right: Hermione's a lot more suspicious and sceptical. So if she gets a diary that talks back, the first thing she does is to go to the library to look up "books that talk back to you." If she doesn't find anything, she takes the book to McGonagall -- because without the troll incident, Hermione is still the teacher's pet and the stickler for rules; hiding something like this from the teachers would be unthinkable. So the Chamber of Secrets is never opened in this version of the story.

Harry is more vulnerable, but then there's a spanner in the works: Dobby. If Dobby finds out that the one to receive the diary is Harry, he'll change his tactics. Now it's not enough to keep Harry away from Hogwarts, now he has to get that diary off Harry.

In any case, the plot changes hugely and I don't think either case would end with the Chamber of Secrets opened.

If some other random student gets the book and the Chamber is opened, then one thing definitely changes: Someone DIES. It was pure luck and coincidence that nobody were killed in canon; you can't take it for granted that you'll get the same Petrifications. SOMEONE'S going to take that basilisk's glare straight on.

  Many of your Points are been to much depending on the Plot being 1:1 by removing the Weasleys, which can indeed go out like this, but the possibilities are countless. All just need a Author who writes it this way
#+end_quote

An author who writes the same plot despite the Weasleys not existing is being plain unimaginative and not thinking very clearly. Things WOULD be different without the Weasleys. I just pointed out why the plot could not be the same if the Weasleys didn't exist. It would be up to the author to find different plots to replace the Weasley-reliant ones... and if said author just copy-pastes the same plots as in canon, that's what I'd call a waste.

If you're going to have a Weasley-less AU, then at least do something DIFFERENT.

***** I agree with most of your points except when you say that "Hermione is the stickler for rules." Many readers perceive Hermione as someone who abides by the rules religiously yet one can make the argument that she broke more school rules than either Harry and/or Ron combined. For example, in Chamber of Secrets, she brewed the Polyjuice Potion, which she insisted would be "breaking about 50 school rules."

***** Well, im sure, the Happenings of the Canon would still happen, BUT not in the same order, as the Canon says. Maybe the chamber will be opened in Harrys 5th or last Year and the Result (defeating the Basilisk and accidentally discover, that Basilisk Venom can destroy Horcruxes (maybe to that time, through a twisted development of the timeline, Harry would know about the Horcruxes)). Thats said, Sirius wouldnt escape in 3rd Year, but either earlier or (much) later (poor Harry, no "relative" to cheer up his fate). But on that Situation, Harry would maybe not be teached the Patronus at all or under different Circumstances, maybe through Lupin, maybe another Person.

*** To be fair, you are assuming quite a lot (granted this is a thought experiment). But right off the bat you assume that Harry misses the train. Its entirely possible that with the Weasleys not around, Harry finds the Barrier on his own in some other way or as another poster said, sends an owl message. In addition, there has always been some speculation (granted its conspiracy theories) that it was all intentional and that Dumbledore intended to have Harry "discover" the Weasleys at the platform and befriend them. Dumbledore has manipulated so much its not beyond the realm of belief.

Regardless, the point is that while its an interesting tale you weave, it assumes a TON. But it is fun to think on.

How? You don't really provide a counter argument. Dumbledore is well known to manipulate those around him and the situations involved. That's cannon.

The question is less about his ability to manipulate or whether he does manipulate, as we know he does. Its more about how much did he manipulate, how far did he go with his manipulations, and were they for the best of all involved? Manipulation can be done with the best of intentions, and for the "greater good", but at the same time can still be seemingly grey in nature, or cause harm or hurt to some.

******** Everyone manipulates to a degree. When you ask someone if they could please do something, you are technically using the social pressure to manipulate them into doing this. But there is that kind manipulation, and there is the “I be going to make everyone be my pawn because I be manipulate” kind. What Dumbledore is doing is the former kind, with a lot higher stakes certainly and sometimes with weird choices but definitely the former kind, whereas the latter kind is what would be needed for his “ultimate manipulator” image and /that/ is fanon.

The issue there is that a lot of people don't look into the actual character of Albus Dumbledore and decide that “oh, hey, some manipulations, he is a Dick-Dastardly--like manipulator” when in reality a lot of what he did was caused by him not knowing whether he should try his best to help at the cost of others' happiness or let them be and have consequences happen, and by him being lost in what to do.

** It is true that Harry's life tends to revolve around the Weasleys. Harry lacks muggle friends (no thanks to the Dursleys), and he's not very good at making friends at Hogwarts either; Ron is pretty much his closest connection, with Hermione, Sirius and Hagrid all coming a close second.

It's some of the Weasleys who rescue Harry after he's locked in his room at the start of Chamber of Secrets, it's Ron's pet rat who turns out to be Peter Pettigrew, it's the Weasleys who bring him to the Quidditch World Cup...though their importance tends to drop off around book 5 once Harry's relationship with Dumbledore and his conflicts with the Ministry and Voldemort come to the fore.

A trend I do seem to have noticed in fanfiction is that when the Weasleys are pushed into the background, Hermione tends to take on Ron's role as Harry's school friend, confidant and 'second', while Sirius (once he's released or escapes or such) tends to play the family role, including getting Harry to the Quidditch World Cup.

None of which are necessarily bad things and all could be easily done. As for Scabbers, well to be honest I always thought he could of just hid at Hogwarts.

*** LOL fair enough although to be honest is that his role seems to ENTIRELY revolve around the rest of his family. Like the twins, I actually enjoyed his character a good chunk of the time, but he also felt weighed down by the other Weasleys.

** Removing the Weasleys is a big one. Them not being in the books could mean as much as Harry missing his first ride to Hogwarts because he doesn't know how to get to the platform. But it opens up quite a bit of space to fill with other characters. Frankly, the Weasleys weren't really part of wizarding society - and hear me out here. They never really went anywhere. They weren't at feasts, or street-fests. They didn't even have a BBQ with the Lovegoods and Diggorys, who we know lived right next to them (or at least we never read that).

So, one of the biggest changes that I would use the open space for is to introduce Harry much more into wizarding society. We could use those space-fillers to look much more into the traditions and values of magical Britain. The Weasleys also provided him with a bottom-up POV of their society, while another family could maybe make it a top-to-bottom view.

And now I'm just brainstorm-rambling. First contact, and probably the most important was made in the Hogwarts Express. Ron Weasley meets his best mate for the first time. To remove him from that, however, you'd only have to use Ron's weaknesses. If he'd bumble over his filter-less mouth, Harry could easily end up resenting him and not Malfoy (who without Ron to snort at his name may not have ended up spoiling Slytherin for Harry). So we have a Slytherin Harry who is on shaky terms with Malfoy.

Of course we have to dig deep in the OC chest for this one. Practically no one in Slytherin has any more character development than "evil, sneer, cruel laugh". I doubt that someone as boisterous as Draco Malfoy would make Harry's friendlist. In general I would think a Slytherin Harry rather lonely. But because no-sidekick ain't an option, lets make Daphne Greengrass his confidante. She's a bit shy, very educated and likes to take the path of least resistance. We add Tracy Davis as our new Ron - a bit loud, a bit more impulsive. There, Trio, bam!

Philosopher Stone plotline resolves itself much sooner. Snape is highly unsure how to deal with a Potter in Slytherin. He pauses his hate for a bit, to see if it was a fluke. As petty and cruel a man Snape is, I also think him an observant and deductive man. The simple impulse of looking - truly looking at Harry without the veil of hate clouding his judgement may end up making him "see more of Lily" in him. He will never be a friend of Harry's, but a civil Snape may change everything. They don't suspect Snape of being the thief and open their eyes to other possibilities. Snape tells them enough to keep them from doing something stupid. Dumbledore manages to catch Voldemort's spirit while he's staring into the Mirror.

The Greengrasses live in Hogsmeade, in a part of the village where the students normally don't go. Harry being such a close friend to their daughter at the end of the year is invited to stay. He thinks that to be great, of course. He can be right next to Hogwarts for even longer. He goes swimming in the Black lake, roams the streets of Hogsmeade and makes friends with a few shopkeepers. He also attends a few fests, gets to know the people. That ends up making Harry much more aware of the fact that his fame isn't just because "OMFG Boy-Who-Lived", but a much more profound set of feelings.

Harry also severly lacks the muggle perspective often brought into play by Hermione. Daphne and Tracy have no idea about muggles. Neither does rest of the Slytherins. Certain issues are a non-entity to this Harry. He gets desensitized to some issues and concepts. And he also gets a feeling for /where/ the resentment of muggles and muggleborn comes from. Not that he himself becomes a pureblood supremacist, but he has a deeper understanding of the initial argument that eventually ended up becoming Voldemorts rallying point.

Anyway. A thousand options. Main point is that without the Weasleys, pretty much everything would be different - from the very start of PS to whatever the end of Voldemort will be then.

*** You just laid out a Fan Fic that I would LOVE to read. Might want to pass it on as a prompt if you dont write ;)

But yea, Its definitely an interesting thing to think on. As I have read peoples answers and ideas its been intriguing. There are those that argue its no longer cannon if the Weasleys are not in it. But thats the point, what if they were NOT in cannon.

You laid out an interesting but extremely plausible scenario, and the idea towards the end that he has a deeper understanding of the initial argument against muggles is perfectly understandable considering he was raised by the Dursleys (the worst sort). I can see a much more grey Harry who, while still having hatred Voldemort for killing his parents, certainly would be a more "grey" individual.

** I think it can be done... they serve mainly as an anchor for Harry into the "good" side of the Wizarding World, for which any family can serve the same function. In fact most would do it better: I've often critiqued the role of the Weasleys since they don't seem to fit in very well, so they seem to be outliers instead the anchors they are supposed to be. A muggleborn family would be much more interesting here if you want the perspective of outliers and something like the Greengrass family would work much better for the "inside perspective" approach (also it would be neat if they actually respected Muggles, maybe because of their business relationships, instead of treating them as a quaint curiosity). Also it would be good if they don't have such close ties to Dumbledore... the hero worship gets seriously annoying.

Now, plot-wise there have been plenty of fics which make it work: Ron can easily be replaced by Neville or Luna (Harry/Hermione/Luna is clearly the superior freudian-trio in every way; Harry/Hermione/Neville is often just boring and low-energy... too cerebral) and Ginny in CoS can be any random girl (don't forget Ginny wasn't much more than a random girl before book 5/6). I'm sorry Ron fans, he's not unique and doesn't contribute any useful abilities and won't be missed. I never bought that someone as dim-witted as Ron is actually some kind of Chess savant, but there's no reason to keep the tasks the same in Book 1 if it's an AU anyway. If you need someone to be a shitty friend to Harry on occasion just use Seamus.

Clearly a big problem will be Scabbers/Pettigrew, but I think he could be transplanted into another family without huge issues. Neville now has a rat instead of a toad, done.

The biggest problem will actually be the twins (notice how the most likable part of the Weasleys are also the most relevant to the plot, helpful and useful?). Harry needs to be broken out of his prison in year 2 (maybe another family would take more of an interest in Harry's personal life than relying on their underage sons), he needs to learn about the Marauders and the map somehow, he needs something to do with the winnings from the Triwizard (wanting to help out friends who want to start a business works beautifully and makes Harry more likeable) also the story needs some comedic relief and by taking out Ron ("look at the idiot") we've already taken away a source of slapstick humor. There's also the cool magical gadgets invented by the Twins that are suddenly now gone. It's the most difficult part and I don't think there's an easy solution here. You could be a little bit lazy and just give Tonks two younger siblings who are twins though (why the fuck are there so many single children aside from the Weasleys anyways?).

It's very probable that I forgot something important and will look like an idiot, but I'm sure someone will correct me. It's undeniable that the Weasleys are a central point of the Books that many characters revolve around and if you take them out you will need to find a new 'center' for the story or everything will feel disconnected. As flawed as I think JKRs idea of an idealized 'large family' is, they serve their role as a central hook very well. As much as I dislike a lot about the Weasleys, they are colorful, unique and interesting... It's hard to write an ensamble of OCs that can fill that gap if the Weasleys don't exist.

  Hermione's name was called. Trembling, she left the chamber with Anthony Goldstein, Gregory Goyle and *Daphne Greengrass*. Students who had already been tested did not return afterwards, so Harry and Ron had no idea how Hermione had done.

Literally the only mention of her in the series. Reading your comments in this thread, I really think you should go re-read the series before you start commenting on canon or characterization. You're opinions have been heavily influenced by bad fanon.

*** Hermione is an interesting case for me. I have a love/hate relationship with her as a character.

I think she was done a disservice by JK in that, even after her "viewpoint" on authority and the world began changing, JK did not do a very good job reflecting that at times down the road when she SHOULD have had a different viewpoint or acted differently based upon the writing. It was if JK repeatedly brought her back to her original personality even though that was not who she was anymore, and most of the time that caused her to be annoying.

However I also enjoyed a brainy, extremely curious, and very loyal girl character who transforms from a bit of a ugly duckling into a gorgeous swan (as corny as that sounds). I also thought from day 1, that this was going to be Harry's match. A muggleborn extremely smart girl like Lily, who is very loyal to him, and who he has fights with at times, but is still a great friend with. It crushed me when suddenly things were not going that way and I think it got me hung up some on Hermione, making me like her MORE not less almost out of spite to JK.

I actually prefer Harry paired with someone beyond Ginny/Hermione, but if forced to choose, I would choose Hermione every damn time and so I tend to read lots of Harry/Hermione fics.

****** Breakfast in New York has a really interesting premise, and I enjoyed the first several chapters, though halfway in, I stopped reading. I can't remember why, but for some reason, I became detached from the story and characters. I didn't even end up finishing it. Though, that's only my opinion on it.

To me, Vox Corporis took some time to get into, but when it started, it was an incredible read. I particularly liked the parts when Harry went to stay with Hermione, her parents, and her gran. Those couple of chapters are pure gold in my mind; true treasures.
