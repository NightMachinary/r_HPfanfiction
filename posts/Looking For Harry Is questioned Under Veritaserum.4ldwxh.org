** The one you're thinking of is linkffn(insidious inquisitor). I've read a few stories involving Veritaserum, but I think they were part of large one-shot collections and I can't find them again. I tried googling it and pretty much everything that came up involved Snape or Malfoy using Veritaserum to force Harry to admit his hidden sexual attraction for them followed by a bunch of butt stuff.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

**** I've recently read that story and just have to say it seemed really misleading. It early on teases Harry becoming a Dark Lord, but [[/spoiler][the whole story deals with him becoming a vigilante assassin. It's not addressing a real rise to power at all - even Voldemort did more politically than trying to kill his opposition.]]

***** Well the first 10 chapters, where you could say Harry acts like a vigilante assassin don't cover that huge a timeline. The last part (the Epilogue), which is 8 years later shows that Harry did accomplish quite a bit. Hogwarts has mixed blood students, and Neville is Harry's voice in the Winzengamot - meaning that it is through Neville that Harry pushed for the reforms that he wanted for Teddy, so that Teddy would be able to live freely and without oppression. And he has a strong core of loyal followers and is immersed in the Dark Arts - like Voldemort, but at the same time his goals are much more different. At least, that's how I see it!

Considering the Fic has only 11 chapters I think my original assertion is fair.

#+begin_quote
  the Epilogue
#+end_quote

Even that doesn't show much of a Dark Lord - just that he has a vicious reputation and people are afraid to cross him. Not sure if that is enough for that label, but I guess it depends on your own frame of reference.

******* I agree that Harry seems like a vigilante assassin, but then again you can't switch a flip and become a Dark Lord in a day. I think that assassinating the opposition was to ensure that the reforms he wanted to happen would be pushed through the Wizengamot/Ministry with minimal resistance.

Well yes, but if you want to write a story about becoming a Dark Lord shouldn't you focus on the actual important bits and not only on the first percent of that journey - especially if that first percent could also be done by a masked superhero? What's even the point of exposing yourself to the world as a Dark Lord if that's all you are going to do?

To be honest I suspect that the author didn't really think about how to grasp power as a wannabe tyrant/dictator. Why would a Dark Lord even try to kill the weak-minded sympathizers of the earlier Dark Lord? They seem perfect as political puppets if their loyalties can be swayed - he could still dispose of them when they have lost their usefulness if they disgust him. Just killing all your opposition does not magically get your will be done and - honestly - the implication that this is what "got it done" seems really kinda dumb. Never heard of the French Revolution? Surely Hermione would know about that and how well killing everyone had worked out.

********* Most of those Voldemort sympathisers/supporters were Pureblood bigots. Their aims were opposite to what Harry wanted. Harry wanted tolerance for all. Voldemort's supporters were all for 'Anyone not a pureblood must be treated like filth, or barely accepted'. Harry became a Dark Lord for the right reasons - the end actually justified the means, as shown by the epilogue. Voldemort and his supporters were Dark for the sake of gaining power/being dark, etc.

  A series of Vignettes involving possibly the second most powerful but underused magic in the HP universe, Veritaserum. AU after GOF. Rating increased to T due to a bit of implied sexual situations, attempted suicide, abuse, and other nasty stuff.
