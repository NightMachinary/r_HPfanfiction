But this really depends on how you read his reaction. I, personally, see it as a mixture of impressed and condescending.

** It's no different than how we marvel at animals fashioning and using tools. Wizards in canon look down on muggles and people like Arthur are fascinated by their use of technology to fill in the perceived gaps left by not having magic. We take these things for granted, because for us, they are normal and it's magic that's extraordinary.

It makes sense that if you grew up only knowing magic, seeing how people manage without it and are still able to do a lot of the same things you can /with/ magic would be fascinating.

** For me the biggest one of these is when someone brings up the Moon landings or Muggle science in general and the wizard is like "Oh wow how could I have been so ignorant and provincial! I don't know anything about space or how the universe works!"

But:

1. In PoA, Harry sees a moving model of the Milky Way galaxy for sale in Diagon Alley. It's stated that he could complete his astronomy homework using it, so we know that it's a functional model, not just an ornament. So wizards: (a) have mapped the galaxy to a far greater degree than Muggles have, and (b) can simulate celestial movements in a way that not even all the supercomputers on Earth combined could achieve.

2. Since wizards know about magic and Muggles don't, Muggles are clearly lacking understanding of a key aspect of the universe. At worst Muggle science is completely wrong and the universe is fundamentally magical in nature. At best Muggle science is still mostly correct, but only when limited to a domain where nothing magical is happening. Either way, there's a huge asterisk hanging over Muggle science in the HP universe.

*** 1...seems like a stretch. It's good enough to do his astronomy homework, yes. But we're talking about what is effectively a highschool ellective. Wizards may have mapped the galaxy quite thouroughly, they may not have, but making judgements based on being able to complete your highschool homework seems ill advised.

And hell, I could go out and buy Univers simulator right now on steam, which is pretty similar to what's described

*** I had an idea for a fic where draco discovers that humans have landed on the moon and instantly decides that he should use the Malfoy fortune to start the wizarding space program

I think while wizards might know more about the movement of the stars they might consider the fact muggles actually stepped foot on the moon impressive which prompts the wizards to go alright how can we do that

**** Honestly, a wizarding space program is easy. Apparition doesn't have a distance limit (otherwise it would be another D), only a Destination limit. If you know what it's like there, then you can apparate there. Blind apparition is also possible, so you don't need to have been there before. All you need is a simulated environment of a specific spot on the moon, with the data gained through enchanted telescopes, divination, or just muggle photographs, and you have the "Destination part" down.

Protection from the vacuum is different, but Bubblehead charms exist and shields capable of stopping energy and objects exist, so shields that keep air in exist as well.

Protection from the cold is also possible through magic, as is protection from the sun's radiation.

Teach the wizard a few charms, let him spend some time in the moon-chamber and you've got a space program.

** This is the age old philosophical debate that's been raging in the fandom since time immemorial.

Magic versus Technology.

To answer your question, here are a few possibilities I can think of off the top of my head:

- Some people think that if they had magic, they could do better than the magicals in canon do.

- Some people are just interested in the question and want to contrast and compare the magical world versus the muggle world

- Its a plot device than can lead the story in a direction an author wants to go

- The author feels threatened by the idea that something could be stronger than they and/or their society are, so want to flex on spec ops or nukes or other technology.

- The author is trying to make some political or moral statement about how the magicals in power are too conservative

Regardless of the motivation, its clearly a tired argument that we don't need to revive every week.... because its clear the magic is far more powerful than technology, and I'd be willing to fight to the death anyone that disagrees with me because they are clearly inbred savages.

** Because "awe at an alien environment" has little to do with comparing two systems.

Scenes like Kagura from speed grapher encountering a train (or the fantasy characters from GATE) doesn't suggest it is somehow better than her private lemo. But she has never encountered it before.

A bit of fish out of water and s bit of watching people interact with alien environments

I mean, I think those are rarely done well, but it is a stock storyline people like to play with. And usually those fics are not the ones that are doing 'muggle curbstomp' (because muggle curbstomp' usually included using the wizarding world's narrow world view against it, not curing it)
