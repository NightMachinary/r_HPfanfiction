I've been reading too many fanfics that treat the trios friendship like something shallow and replaceable, so I'd really like to see one where their friendship is highlighted and praised. Thanks!

All of these have Harry friends with Ron and Hermione, and tell compelling stories as well. These aren't merely slice of life fluff fics. Starfox5 is also commonly recommended for stories fitting this prompt. Of their stories, the only one I recommend is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13072492/1/Democracy]] (though it is not from any of the trio's perspectives).
