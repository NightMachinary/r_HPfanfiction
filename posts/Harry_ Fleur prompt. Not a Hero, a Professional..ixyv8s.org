Among muggles there are many stories of haunted places, ghost sightings, demonic possessions. And lately, another kind of story emerged. When the news of a new haunting or possession surface, a pair of people quickly appear, a man and a woman. The man, tall and slim, with gentle, compassionate eyes, always willing to listen to the people's troubles. His companion, an ethereally beautiful woman, her love for the man readily apparent. Her smile is the brightest anyone has ever seen, she expertly coaches details and secrets from the witnesses. They both carefully listen and ask questions, find out as much as they can and then actually proceed to sooth the angry spirits, end the possessions, dispel the hauntings. Without waiting for thanks, they then disappear. The only details people recall is the woman's silvery hair and the man's curious, lightning shaped scar. Or in other words, Harry and Fleur working officially for the ICW, dealing with threats to the Statute of Secrecy. Be it ghosts with unfinished business, restless souls of children who died violent deaths, or malicious poltergeists, even actual demons. When they can solve the problem with gentle words or finding certain objects, they happily do so. And in the more dangerous cases? Well, then the gloves come off.

I'd like to give credit to the members of the Harry/Fleur discord for coming up with some of these amazing prompts. If you want to join then feel free to click the link. [[https://discord.gg/q63UUxD]]

** Would be cool if you could involve Ed and Lorraine Warren from the conjuring movies. They could be squibs or normal muggles trying to deal with haunted stuff/possessed people and Harry and Fleur could come in to save the day.

You could use Harry's master of death status to aid him in this profession. I would envision he would have power over ghosts, spirits, ... and his proficiency in defense against the dark arts would also come in handy.

Fleur could be the brains of the duo. Doing all the necessary paperwork and maintaining the contacts with the ICW/local ministries, ... You could have her be much more sensitive to emotions/echos of emotions, because of her veela ancestry(kind of like Gabrielle in 'a cadmean victory' - chapter 33), making it easier to track demons/ghosts and having her be the compassionate ear for terrified/grieving clients.
