Knowing that Dumbledore is quite fond of the bad boy type, it becomes increasingly jealous of the amount of time its master spends thinking and talking about a certain Dark Lord called Voldysomethingstupid.

***** I threw the prompt over here because I had this silly idea after reading a one-shot from the Elder Wand's perspective. It's more serious and talks about how it corrupts its fake masters in order to deliver them to its real master, Death, but is amazed at the power of love when both Grindelwald and Dumbledore refuse to kill each other.

I may take a stab at it if I come up with an actual plot and will let you know.
