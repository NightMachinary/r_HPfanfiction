To clarify the second, I mean stories where the monarch does actually take part in ruling the magical world and isn't just a figurehead like Britain's current royalty.

For the first, I'd prefer fics set in Harry's era. I don't mind if they're about the statue being implicated at that time, but I want fics that show how things would be different if it hadn't existed before then.

Nothing explicit, please, but everything else is fine.


** Well, there's my fic which has a couple of wizarding-only monarchies: the ones mentioned are France, Spain, and Russia. linkffn(Scion to the Noble and Most Ancient House of Beaudelaire)

  Anthonie, son to the Marquis of Beaudelaire, is able to attend Hogwarts through an ancient bylaw of the school. Simultaneously, through his family's then eventually his own eyes, he will watch the political affairs of the wizarding world. He and his friends will have to deal with evil plots and play proxies, but their families won't let them down in times of need. Gen Hiatus

** This is coincidental.

I just today posted the first chapter of my story where the SoS never existed, and the last Tudor King was a powerful monarch who has cursed the throne and so been followed by a line of Queens.

It's on a Snippet thread at the moment, but there's more written that I'll be throwing up before long.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/draughty-drafts-semi-snip-thread.919206/#post-74158692][Hogwarts College School]] is the 1991 AU where Harry is about to attend this vastly different world's Hogwarts (in London).

Then A World Without Secrecy is in the same thread (also on ffn and Ao3), and deals in the same world with the war against Grindelwald in a world where Wizards and Muggles fight alongside one and other. It's complete, basically, just the last section (three of three) I want to add in a little extra hallucinationy section to the climax and I haven't quite got round to doing it yet.
