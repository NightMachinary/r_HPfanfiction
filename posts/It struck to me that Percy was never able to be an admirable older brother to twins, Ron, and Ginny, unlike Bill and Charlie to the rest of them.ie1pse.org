** I'd say Percy has a couple of things going bad for him. Number 1 being he's very rigid as an individual, he believes in the system and wants to climb it to achieve success. Which happens to be the exact opposite of the twins. Number 2 is the fact Charlie and Bill were more distant figures for their siblings with charlie being 6 years older than the twins, and Bill 8 years older. So they were always going to be the "mature/cool" siblings, while percy being being only 2 years older than the twins was close enough that their was no chance of hero worship. Number 3 was the simple choice of career path. Charlie works with dragons and Bill is a curse breaker. And while everyone has to start somewhere, a low level government suit is simply not "cool".

*** I think the age thing is key- plus the fact that the next children were twins.

The two eldest two years apart, so were four and six when Percy was born. They're the right age to play together but too old for him to be a meaningful playmate.

The twins are the right age, but there are two of them, so they're a unit on their own, which they're never a part of.

Then Ron and Ginny are four and five years younger than him, so same problem.

Because of boarding school, the Weasley children aren't living at home full time after the age of 11.

Bill is out of the house by the time the twins are three, Ron is one, and Ginny is born. Charlie is out of the house by the time they are five, three, and two, respectively.

The youngest don't have the experience of living full time with their older brothers. They're fun visitors on the holidays. They're cool because they don't really know them.

Percy has no playmates, and, he's the only one who gets four years of being the baby, until Ginny comes along.

It's no wonder he's looking for adult attention and affirmation.

  Ideally, he should've been a person of immense respect with his academic brilliance and high ambitions, but instead was treated as an annoying person by the younger childrens.

I think one of the worst problem Percy had was that Bill came before him. Being a brillant student with 12 OWLs? Getting the Prefect AND the Head Boy position? Bill already did all that, but he did it while also being cool.

While he shows it less than Ron, Percy also suffer from the Middle Child symdrom. The Weasleys children are all ridiculously talented and despite being only the 3rd, his older brothers had already both left a big trace on the school.

** Actually I suspect that Ron isn't actually all that into mischief: he has been targetted by the twins enough that the appeal has faded. He simply /also/ doesn't want to be a stuck up prat like Percy, and the age gap between Ron and Bill/Charlie is sufficient that he has trouble finding the right ballence between the brothers whose examples he is most familiar with. Harry's misadventures and the trouble that finds them every year doesn't help, because Percy, prat that he is, cannot distinguish between the trouble the twins create and the trouble Harry lands in.

He spent hours talking politics and smart-y stuff with her. He might not have been a cool brother but he was a cool uncle (at least to Rose) and I'd like to image this could've been a bit canon-ish too.

** I would get along more with Percy than the rest. I am lazy so I wouldn't go out like the rest of them. I like it quiet and to read books, so I would spend more time with the calm and quiet Percy talking about books, laws and other things than with the loud or sometimes just rather rude twins and Ron. I don't really know about Ginny, didn't read the books and I saw the movies about 4 years ago so I don't remember much of her.

But in all honesty, the twins would annoy me at some point. I don't really like pranks particularly if I'm the one who gets pranked and they are always so loud and happy. Yeah, I'm one of those who get grumpy when everyone else is being overly happy.

The other thing I noticed was that with the age gap between Bill/Charlie and the Twins down is quite large. It honestly gets treated like Percy is the eldest brother for the Twins, Ron, and Ginny. Then Bill and Charlie and like cool cousins that come in and visit.

Unfortunately Percy didn't appear to have as close of friends (many assume he was friends w his dormmates but not best friends like Dean to Ron or something) and did not outgrow his prat nature. It seems the wizarding world is similar to our own; kids in school get bullied when they are too uptight and too serious about life.

Bill - Charlie = 2 year, 1 week, 6 day Bill - Percy = 5 years, 8 months, 3 weeks, 3 days Bill - Twins = 7 years, 4 months, 3 days Bill - Ron = 9 years, 3 months, 1 day Bill - Ginny = 10 years, 8 month, 2 weeks

By the time Ron had started school Bill has been graduated for little over 2 years. And because of the age differences, as Bill and Charlie went off to school, Percy became the older brother until he went to school himself and for those few years before the twin started, Percy was suddenly the younger brother again. I feel like for that short time it was just Bill, Charlie, and Percy in school Percy probably was able to more attention from his eldest two brothers.

** Kinda sounds like he had a bunch of different expectations on his shoulder. Bill excelled academically, Charlie excelled in sports, both chose careers that meant they left the family home and even the country as soon as they left Hogwarts. Then there were the twins right behind him, causing all sorts of trouble.

I feel like Percy wanted to stand out by performing to the same ridiculously high standards set by Bill, but unlike Bill, he was pleasing his mother by remaining in the country and having a safe job (she was likely distraught over her older sons planning to not only leave but also do death-defying stunts all day) and pleasing his father by following in his footsteps and eventually climbing higher on the Ministry food chain.

With so many rule-breakers around him, always drawing attention to themselves, it's no surprise that Percy, naturally more introverted but still highly ambitious and intelligent, felt the need to be the ‘good child' who can always be counted on. Sure, this leads to him trusting authority too much and he turns into a bit of a bigot because of it, but when you think about it logically, his reasoning is pretty sound: it's the word of a traumatized teenager who's known to him as this kind Quidditch jock who's academically average and constantly in the middle of trouble (and dragging Percy's youngest siblings with him) versus the literal Minister of Magic.

Percy is a fantastic older brother in this fic and a large focus of it is Percy trying to find out who he is and help fill in the gape hole that Molly's death has left in their family. Highly recommend it.

  A freak accident with Arthur's enchanted Ford Anglia causes a minor explosion and a major change in the Weasley household. With Arthur in a coma and Molly having passed away, Bill and Charlie can't afford to quit their jobs and must support the family from afar. Thus, it falls to Percy to handle the day-to-day, even if he's not sure that he can.

** It was probably designed that way for the sake of creating and maintaining conflict and move the plot along. Percy's personality and character was written to be unlikable enough (at least in Harry's opinion and therefore the reader) so that humor can be made at his expense and be considered justified, and so his siblings wouldn't go to him for help or advice, even under dire circumstances, like the troll in Book 1.

Ron and Harry, two first years that barely know a single spell, would rather go off by themselves to warn Hermione while a troll is somewhere in the castle, instead of telling Percy, who's not only Ron's older brother, but a prefect and a fifth year. You know, someone that might know a lot of spells and know about trolls and actually be competent enough to deal with the situation. But no, Ron specifically said that they had to avoid being seen by Percy because reasons, just so Harry and Ron could have their hero moment, save Hermione, and form the Golden Trio.

Granted, Harry and Ron weren't expecting to confront the troll, but why take the risk? Well, it's because the series would be rather dull and boring if Harry and friends didn't put themselves in the action and let others fix the conflict.

Sure, Fred and George were pretty much trolls, but they did the right thing when it mattered most. When Harry was locked up by the Dursleys in his second year, the twins helped Ron bust him out. When Harry made a sloppy attempt at sneaking into Hogsmeade, the twins gave him a better way to sneak out (yes, they were breaking the rules when it was believed that a serial killer was on the loose, but they still raised the spirits of their youngest brother's best friend). When Voldemort returned, the twins stood by their family through it all.

They helped rescue Harry and saved him from the Dursleys, but I'd also argue that breaking him out was in their nature, whether or not he was being neglected. I doubt the twins really understood the extent of the abuse, and also tagged along just to steal the car or something. They also stuck by with their family, BUT, of course, everyone in their family actually seemed to like them. Percy also seemed especially concerned for Ginny in COS, ran to pull Ron out of the lake in GOF, and, unlike Fred and George, congratulated Ron on making prefect, even when he wasn't speaking to his family. We don't know if Percy got close to making amends before then, and seeing how his family was in hiding, he couldn't have gotten the chance to talk before the battle for several months.

** I have always felt that there existed a degree of familial toxicity around Percy. For all that he tried his best to enforce order, he was quieter and more solitary than his rambunctious younger siblings and he was not prone to athletic or 'heroic' feats like his adventurous and cooler older brothers. He was counted on to be a rules-and-authority-obsessed prat and was not respected or much-loved by the siblings who were supposed to be his playmates or by the siblings who came after and looked up to the fun, loud, ostentatious twins instead of to the more responsible Percy.

He clearly wanted to earn himself meaningful attention, but failed despite his best efforts and intentions. He landed himself a safe and local job to please his mother; and at the Ministry, too, to please his father. A well-paying competetive job which would have been rife with opportunities for advancement. Percy, now in his Majority, was then told by his parents that they forbade him from working in the Ministry because reasons summed up by: "There is a war on; we want to stifle your dreams so that at least you'll be safe, because your life lived in misery means more to us than your feeling accomplished and important and respected for, really, the first time ever. Because we love you." When he decided that his family was only trying to shackle him to a life of mediocrity, then went through with achieving his current goals anyway, his ties with the Weasleys were (however temporarily) severed. It was not a small issue that Percy became angry and argued. It was not a spontaneous combustion. It must have been building up for years and years and years. That's how I have interpreted it.

I have always HC'd that Percy felt that he would never be good enough for his family, no matter what he did, hence his leaving to pursue his own way: /his/ way.

** I will forever believe that Percy was sorted in the wrong house.

Slytherin would've been perfect for someone as ambitious as him. Ravenclaw too, he would've fit right in.

He doesn't fit in Gryffindor where everyone is so impulsive and reckless, where friendship is placed above everything else, including personal success.

And just like he doesn't fit in Gryffindor, he doesn't really fit in with the rest of his siblings, all so painfully Gryffindor-ish.

It was inevitable that he would end up being the “outcast” in the family.

*** I don't know I do think he's quite brave, he stands up to what he believes is right when it goes against his family which must've been hard to do, but he also acknowledges he was wrong and works to fix his mistakes. I think he's brave in his own way, just not the traditional Gryffindor way.

**** Sure, but he's brave in the same way Luna (or any other character from a different house) can be, it's simply not his defining characteristic, nor what he values the most.

** families just be like that sometimes. It also happens a lot in big families that a responsible older kid will be asked to babysit a lot.

It got to the point where I sort of helped raise some of my younger siblings, which is a bit shitty, to be honest, and does affect the relationship. So bill and Charlie were off at school and Molly was running after the twins, I wouldn't be surprised if Percy helped teach Ron and Ginny how to read and stuff...which we obviously didn't see because we met them later

No. Respect has to be earned - and part of earning respect is to not behave like a dickhead. /Especially/ not in a family.

** It doesn't help Percy that he's axiomatic to a fault. He practically worships The Rules, The System, and Authority Figures. Throw in a heavy dose of political ambition and you've got someone that's practically in love with Bartemius Crouch and Cornelius Fudge.
