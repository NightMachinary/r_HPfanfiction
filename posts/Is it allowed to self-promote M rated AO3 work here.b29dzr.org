*** I know this is going to sound suspect, but can you define minors?

Is this a moderator thing or an admin thing?

** Yep, as [[/u/denarii]] said, you can't link to explicit content involving minors. You can do so if it doesn't, however. And even if it does, you can still discuss the story and give its title; you just can't post a link.
