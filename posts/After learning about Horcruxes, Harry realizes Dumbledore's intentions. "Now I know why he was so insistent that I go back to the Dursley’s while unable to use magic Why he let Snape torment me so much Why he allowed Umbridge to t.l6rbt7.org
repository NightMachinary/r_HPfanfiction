***** Didn't harry complain about umbridged to his head of house and she told him deal with it, keep ur head down and shut up. And on context alone it's clear that snape had a hate boner for Harry, I'm sure the only reason he "protected" Harry was guilt for Lily's death and his fidelity to Dumbledore, who basically holds his leash but prevented him from being tried as death eater. Not only does snape make it clear he hates teaching, but if he's forced to he'd rather teach defense against the dark arts, but he has been continuously denied the position. It's also blatantly clear based on canon comments from dumbledore that A: he knew Harry grew up with a rough and unhappy childhood being mentally abused and treated like a servant, B: was making sure Voldemort would be defeated by Harry letting Voldemort kill kim. C: wanted harry to act his age and have a childhood, hiding things from him as in book 1, 2, 5, and 6, but still made sure he would fufill his "destiny" and even to the end not being sure Harry would survive.

If two things aren't made clear about canon dumbledore is that while he is well meaning, and seeks the defeat of Voldemort, he is willfully manipulative, caring for the end result more for individuals no mater how he claims otherwise, and that he likes holding all the information to his chest, not matter the reason.

A lot of fanfic focuses on these facts, and arguably a better outcome in the war if dumbledore actually trusted more people with essential information, or got actual help rather than relying on a clueless untrained teen and his two friends to save everyone.

Unbreakable oaths and Fidelius exist, so it's not like he couldn't make sure the people he trusted info to didn't betray him, especially knowing the weakness of the Fidelius in hindsight.

Harry has all the reason to bitch and be an angsty moody teen, and by the end of the series I'm surprised he's not more fucked up or traumatized.

What I really hate is the fact he names one of his children on the man that basically made it so he was raised to die (some weird variation of stockholm syndrome, dumbledore edition) because he still thought of the man as a personal hero. And he names his second kid after the man that tormented and mistreated him for years, blatantly hated his relationship to James potter simply because he saw the man's memories and realized snape was working for dumbledore all along, and he always loved his mother. Like that excuses his treatment or his sins somehow, regardless of reasons.

#+end_quote

He complained that she didn't teach them Defense. He absolutely refused to complain about the punishments even when Hermione begged him to.

Snape was a dick and a bully to Harry and made no effort to hide it but Harry never went forward either to complain about his behavior in class. I don't know how things have changed, but going to school in the 2000s, some teachers behaved worse than Snape (calling students stupid, humiliating them if they passed notes by reading them publicly and being unfair with the grading) and no one really did anything about it, mostly because nothing would be done about it since it was your word against them... so I guess that's why I'm not too shocked by Snape's behavior. Other than book 1 which was supposed to be a children's book with a mean and ridiculously unfair professor, he only takes points and gives detentions when students step out of line.

With regards to the Dursleys it also needs to be understood that the story was written in a time when child protection laws might have been a little looser. In the 80s it was still quite socially acceptable to smack your kid if they did something bad, but the level of abuse that is presented in fanon is a few notches taken too far from what we see in the books. Sure Harry lived in a cupboard for most of his childhood and was never bought anything and asked to help his aunt around the house, but they put a roof over his head and didn't send him to an orphanage which would likely have been worse. He had no other living relatives so where were he to go? In his world, not only did he have a target on his back but being a child celebrity would have not necessarily turned out well, as real examples show us, even if Sirius were to not go to prison. Leaving Harry with the Dursleys was not out of malice but out of lack of other options.

I'll admit Dumbledore's plan is quite convoluted and the explanations are not really clear but it's stated that Harry had to walk to his death willingly and accepting in order for the sacrificial love spell to work. I believe that Dumbledore's intent as character was not to be a manipulative mastermind but to be the teacher who teaches Harry values such as humility, love, friendship, sacrifice and help him grow as a hero.

Finally, I prefer the Harry in the books because I read the books to read about a hero. If I wanted to read about the life of every whiney self-entitled teenager/young adult, I'd just open any of my social media and read people's posts.

But that precisely it, his entire plan hinged on the fact about this power of love thing and the prophecy being fulfilled and etc etc, but there was no specific contingency plan, there were no backups, no one else was informed except Harry who told two friends, who are also teenagers. There were literally so many opportunities and instances where everything the plan relied on would have simply failed had certain things not happened by sure dumb luck or happenstance.

I'm not saying dumbledore is a willfully a manipulative evil type character but you'll have to admit the fact he kept so much information to himself is what led to a lot of the problems especially in the last three books a lot of things could have gone so much more smoothly had he just informed Harry Potter exactly the information he needed to know. the whole concept of relying on the idea of the heroes journey not as a metaphor but as a literal path for Harry to take so he could fulfill the prophecy seems like a big role of the dice and it's not like Harry Potter hadn't already proved himself or that he was not already a hero.

******** Why Dumbledore didn't have a plan B? Probably because JK didn't think it through, but I'm sure he would have had one if JK would have written herself into that corner. I agree that looking from an in-universe perspective at it, it seemed kind of stupid that Dumbledore didn't anticipate that Hermione and Ron would go with Harry in his quest. But it also made sense why he was so secretive about it. Voldemort had proven that he can break through some of the most powerful memory charms, as well as the Fidelius... so even if there was an Unbreakable Vow, as you have mentioned in your previous comment, what would have prevented him from torturing his victim until they caved in and decided that breaking the vow and dying is better than dealing with the torture? And from the way he reacts when he finds out about the Horcrux Hunt (even if his victims have no clue why he's killing them), it was most certainly the best move to keep as few people as possible in the light.

Also from an in-universe perspective, even if Voldemort was scared of Dumbledore, he is still pretty much on par with him, to the point that it's stated in HBP that the duel from the Ministry left Dumbledore shaken. Furthermore Dumbledore doesn't know a lot of things such as what or where Ravencalw's horcrux is or where the Hufflepuff one is, and he also gets wrong the location of the Slytherin one (although not through a fault of his own). So he uses the best weapons that he has at his disposal: the twin wands, the sacrificial magic and Voldemort's inability to keep his thoughts straight when it comes to hunting down Harry.

****** I think you've been reading too much fanfiction bud. Dumbledore literally gave Harry to his next of kin, which makes sense when his parents, grand parents, and godfather are all dead or in prison. As a plus, he gets what we are told is inbeatable protection from the people who want to kill him. That seems like the most logical choice. Who else would raise him? Dumbledore had no idea he would be abused. And while he probably realized when Harry came to Hogwarts that he didn't have a very good childhood, he was alive. So it was worth it.

You say Dumbledore raised Harry to die, and yet he didn't have any idea what Horcruxes even were until at least the end of 2nd year. They're very obscure. It would take time to research what they were, and then even more time to realize Harry's scar was one. If I had to guess, I would say he realized in 5th year, when Harry was getting visions. He couldn't really do much with Umbridge, but guess what he did the very next year? Started teaching Harry, and hunting down the Horcruxes. What was he supposed to do? Harry literally had to die for Voldemort to be defeated. Full stop.

People think Dumbledore is some all knowing dude. He's just a very smart old man. He knew Harry had to defeat Voldemort. But he wanted a Harry to have a childhood. That's a good thing. And really, what was he supposed to do? Start training Harry as soon as he came to Hogwarts? He could barely lift a feather, and you expect him to be learning battle spells? That's crazy.

Probably because he realizes Voldemort's new body can anchor Harry to life in specific circumstances. Or because it's typically a bad idea to use blood sacrifice in such a way - Dumbledore has shown to be disappointed at Voldemort when they've fought and when he broke into the inferi pool to retrieve the faux horcrux. I don't think he had confirmation about Harry's horcrux until the "but in essence divided" thing he does with his instruments by book 5.

******* No, my point is regardless of the prophecy, and since neville was also viable candidate regardless if it's self fufilling one, banking on the date of the world on a single teenager was a dumb plan, hence all things going into it and the end result can be laid at dumbledores feet. You have a group of adult wizards with mixed skill sets available to you in the form of the order if the phoenix, one senior aurora in moody, most likely a few others, snape is a potions master, spy and arguably extremely good a offensive magic. You have the hogwarts staff, a healer, a transfiguration professor, a charms expert and duelist. I'm not saying train harry if it were possible to reach even the same level as a grown wizard in a fraction of the time, let alone be able to face voldemort. But the whole notion of the power of love, and the little clues and the whole horcrux hunt seemed like a stupid plan. I mean if was a worry about leaking info, dumbledore literally had access to a pensive, and could have extracted all the relevant info to show to harry in a few sessions. Instead most of a year was wasted on harry fumbling around with ocolomncy training, and suspecting draco, and trying to get a single memory from slughorn.

Blood protection only extents to direct phisical tough from voldemort, mental intrusion, or magical attacks, though that last one isn't quite clear. It's never stated how far this protection extends from harry, does it cover the entire property of #4, the entire block, is it only his person. So no I don't see the protection being unbeatable, as he clearly can still be heavily injured and killed from outside means, like a falling to his death from a broom jinxed by a voldemort possessed quirll, a basilisk bite, being kissed by dementors. He can also clearly be affected by phisical forces or spell work from others, what was to stop quirll from giving harry a poison, a toxic potion, or just summoning or transfiguring a rock and bashing his head with it in the first book.

And even if they were area based, as is hinted in waiting to his 17th birthday when the order waits for it to expire before they leave #4 it's not like he would spend every minute of every day inside private drive. And although we don't know exactly how two dementors tracked him, it's made clear it was somehow related to umbridge, and if he didn't know the patronous charm his soul would have gotten sucked out.

In essence the entirety of Dumbledore plan as it was constructed was based on so much speculation, improbable circumstances, luck, hope, vague interpretation of a prophecy, and convoluted events it sheer dumb luck and arrogance on voldemort's part that saw him loosing. There a myriad of example in the actual books where voldemort had ample time to try various methods to get harry killed it abducted. Voldemorts need to personally kill harry and his need to know the entire prophecy are what led to his downfall... eventually.

And yet he knew the entire prophecy since before Harry was born, and the basis of his plan before he knew about the horcruxes was that Harry Potter had to be the one that defeated Voldemort specifically because Voldemort was the one that chose him and marked him as the equal, therefore Harry would have a "power he knew not" and neither couldn't live while the other survives.

The power being harry's capacity to love and rally people behind him. His plan only required harry to die when he realized harry was also a horcrux. Yet this all still hinges on a teenager being the linchpin of an entire plan.

I'm sorry if that's your definition of teaching, showing him a few memories every couple of weeks really good teaching. Not only should it have been obvious after the first few lessons about Harry not being good with the mind arts but then when Snape stopped teaching him Snape never told on the door oh yeah I'm not teaching him anymore and everybody just assumes that Harry learned ocolomncy, and rather than inform harry about all his gathered info on the horcruxes, that he was already dying, that he already knew about malfoy, his plan, and the possibility of the elder wandb playing a role. Nope let's keep harry in the dark so he can have a happy child hood and not worry, even though harry at this point already knows he has to defeat voldemort. Good plan.

She is not so intelligent that she knows how to use a spell just by its incantation.

Aside from the outlier of Harry immediately using Sectumpsempra and Levicorpus without knowing what they do, any other instance of learning a spell involves studying about and practicing it.

Legilimency involves navigating the mind. She doesn't know how to do that without studying about it.

The Memory charm, on the other hand, is used to remove a memory or a lot of memories. At least, you will need to know what memory you are removing. At most, you can remove a big chunk of memories that it can cause the target some mental damage (ala Bertha Jorkins).

My headcanon is that the Memory Charm has two targeting modes:

1. *Temporal mode* It erases the most recent memories---e.g., the last 5 minutes. This mode is easy to cast, but it becomes exponentially more difficult as the time period erased increases and the memories become more integrated. Trying to erase 5 minutes is easy and reliable, but trying to erase the prior 24 hours may well turn the target into a vegetable. Therefore, it's mainly useful for Obliviating Muggles, as well as the Death Eaters at the Diner. Occlumency does not help.
2. *Legilimency mode* It can be used to erase any memories, but it requires successfully using Legilimency to locate them. Therefore, you can't really Obliviate an Occlumens without them noticing.

********** We have very little idea of what's actually involved in Legilimency, except that Snape angrily rejects the analogy of reading a mind like a book. We can also infer that it's difficult enough that vast majority of people, even those, with secrets to keep, don't bother with Occlumency. But, even if we suppose that Hermione can cast the spell, at best that may enable Harry to eventually learn to fight off Legilimency from a beginner like Hermione---not someone even close to Voldemort's calibre.

Like I wrote, I would /love/ to see more fics in which Hermione picks up Legilimency. A fic in which, say, Hermione approaches Snape asking him to teach her so that she could teach Harry would be awesome (particularly if it affects the rest of the story in interesting ways and doesn't end up in a Snape/Hermione 'ship), but we are talking about canon.

Memory Charms and False Memory Charms are spells with a specific purpose and are therefore easier to cast than something flexible like Legilimency. Analogously, Draco could cast Serpensortia---a spell that does exactly one thing---in his second year, but Conjuration in general isn't taught until much, much later, and Draco gives no indication of being a Transfiguration prodigy.
