The first Harry Potter Fanfiction I ever read was Altered Destinies by dobbyelflord. I've looked for years for stories similar to it, but now I turn to y'all. Any recs?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3155057/1/Altered-Destinies][Altered Destinies]] and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4150901/1/Balancing-Destinies][Balancing Destinies]] for the curious.

Which aspect were you looking for? Harry raising Tom? If so, I recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10678294/1/Silk-Roads][Silk Roads]].

*** I did enjoy the Harry raising Tom aspect, but I also enjoyed the historical aspect the author threw in with WWII. I'll check out the stories you linked! Thanks!

*** Balancing Destinies is unfinished and a lot worse than Altered Destinies (imo) for people unfamiliar with them.

**** Definitely think Balancing Destinies is a lot worse, but I'll take anything as long as the author comes back to finish it haha.

***** In case you haven't heard the author actually is working on Balancing Destinies again, last I've heard he won't be posting any of the chapters until he's finished with Weres Harry.

****** Which isn't overly encouraging, as [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8106168/23/Weres-Harry][Weres Harry]] hasn't been updated since August.

** Not exactly the same vein of story, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1646940/1/Learn-from-History][Learn from History]] and its longer and better sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2044600/1/Friend-or-Foe][Friend or Foe]] was pretty good.

At least I think. It's been yeeeeears since I read those.
