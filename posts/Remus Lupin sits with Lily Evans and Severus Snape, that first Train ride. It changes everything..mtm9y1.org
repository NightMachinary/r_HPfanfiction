Remus Lupin never had friends before, not wanting others to know his secret. But when he sits besides Lily Evans and Severus Snape, on his first train ride to Hogwarts, that first choice changes everything


** Might be wrong, but I think something similar happened in linkffn(stages of hope) which is an AU traversal story with our heroes traveling to that universe.

IIRC, Lily and Remus are married and Severus and Sirius are best friends. It is very well written and also emotional.

** Probably an unpopular opinion, but I feel as though the people who assume Lupin had nothing to do with the opinions, attitudes, and behaviors of the Marauders are drastically underselling his character and doing him a disservice. By which I mean to say, Remus, Sirius, and James were all very similar people, so swapping them around should not actually change much of anything. This kind of prompt assumes by default that Lupin was an unwitting and perhaps even unwilling accomplice to trouble and problems that James and Sirius caused, and that Sirius and James were the primary instigators of everything the Marauders did. From everything we've been told about them, */that is absolutely not true./* Remus was every inch cut from the same cloth as James and Sirius, and the person getting dragged around as an accomplice was Peter.

Especially in the context of this train idea, it wouldn't really change much, because by all accounts, Snape wasn't an asshole in the beginning to anybody anyway, nor was Lupin immediate friends with James and Sirius. That came later. So this isn't even non-canon compliant. For all we know, the three of them did share a compartment.

tl;dr, people see an old and broken Lupin that's lost all of his friends, and assume that mild, sad, gray man has anything at all in common with the person who helped turn Hogwarts inside-out and pour enchanted neon paint all over it. They don't. You're really flatting out Lupin and making him two-dimensional by ignoring how he must have obviously changed after James and Lily were killed and Sirius thrown in jail for betraying them all to Voldemort.

*** 100%. This is a guy who described being unleashed as a werewolf in Hogsmeade as some of the 'best times of his life'. He was also more than happy to insult Snape in the Marauders' Map. As an adult, he didn't tell Dumbledore that Sirius was an animagus even after Sirius was seen holding a knife over Ron's bed. He's not some wallflower or the 'responsible' one of the Marauders.

**** That's pretty much my exact take on it as well. Lupin was every bit as vindictive, rebellious, snarky, and chaotic as his friends were. He just hid it far better than either of them: James and Sirius wore their hearts on their sleeves. Remus put on a mask of politeness and manners, and kept everyone away at a distance because he feared being revealed as a werewolf. Remus, Sirius, and James only */became/* friends in the first place because Sirius and James became obsessed with figuring out what secret Remus was hiding, and eventually managed to find out that he was a werewolf. Instead of shunning him or ratting him out to the school, they thought him being a werewolf was */unbelievably cool/*, and accepted him for who he was unconditionally. Only Sirius and James ever got to see the 'real' Remus behind the mask. The real Remus was exactly like Sirius and James.

By the time Harry sees Remus, he's put the mask back on and presumably hasn't taken it off since James died. By that point, the manners aren't an act anymore, they've become who he truly is. He's changed. He grew up, and broke, and had to put himself back together again with what little he had, because everyone he loved and cared about was gone. The mask isn't a mask anymore, it's his real face. You see the occasional spark of mischief in him still, but the 'real' Remus from the Marauder days had been dead for over a decade by then.

I can't prove it, but I assume this is the reason why Remus and Sirius didn't seem to bond back together quite so strongly after they were reunited. Sirius was broken by prison, Remus was broken by loss. They hurt each other irreparably: Remus is hurt that Sirius and James could have ever believed he might be the leak in the Order, while Sirius is hurt that Remus believed he could ever betray Lily and James. The unconditional trust they used to have is gone, the children they used to be are gone, and they've lost some of that rapport they used to have in a way they can't ever get back. All Remus has left is his mask, and all Sirius has left is his revenge.

You can't take that man, the man Remus Lupin turned into after losing everything he had that he cared about in a war, and then project that backwards to try and say "this is what Lupin must have been like in school." That's ridiculous.

I'm not opposed to ideas about shuffling around who was friends with who in the Marauder era of Hogwarts, but in my own personal opinion, this prompt does Lupin a massive disservice. Why would this change anything? He would hold Lily and Snape at arm's length, just he did the entire rest of the school for his entire career there. What makes the two of them special? He would show them his mask of manners, and they would not see through it. They have no reason to question it.

A better prompt might be, what if Lily was the one who became obsessed with solving the mystery of Remus, and what would she do with that information if she got it?

That's not true. According to an essay by Rowling, James and Sirius became friends with Remus /first/ and then they began noticing his monthly absences. Canonically, the only one 'obsessed' with finding out where Lupin disappeared each month was Snape.

**** Remus looked uncomfortable, but unless I'm misremembering the timeline, that was later in their career, near the end of their time at Hogwarts. This is literally the event where Snape snapped and called her a mudblood. We're less than five minutes away from Lily never speaking to Snape again. Lily and Snape were already fighting and drifting apart, and James and Sirius had escalated to high level bullying because by this point in time, Snape had already tried to rat out Lupin as a werewolf.

Lupin was uncomfortable, because James and Sirius almost certainly thought they were avenging their friend. By this point, the relationships between the Marauders, Lily, and Snape had already suffered catastrophic damage. Snape and James butted heads, things went back and forth for years, just like they did with Malfoy and Harry. Snape escalated by taking it out on Lupin and trying to get Lupin expelled or exposed, Dumbledore smacked him down and forbade him from speaking of it, then James and Sirius got ugly in retaliation over what Snape tried to do. This was made worse from Snape's perspective because he owed James his life. He just couldn't get over it or let it go. By this point, everything had already spiraled completely out of control. I'm pretty sure it was THIS summer that Snape took the Dark Mark.

No, it didn't. According to the memory in DH James already saved Severus' life while Lily and him were still talking. So it had to happen during fifth year.

I always suspected that that was the reason why Remus looked uncomfortable - because Sirius and James' rivalery with Snape had already nearly killed Snape - and Snapes tendency to stuck his nose into things where it didn't belong had nearly made Remus a murderer.

** Edit: posted it to ao3 if anyone is interested: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/30776447]]

Remus sat alone his train compartment, trying to distract himself by reading. From his nervousness because of his first train ride to Hogwarts of course. And even more from the sniffling girl by the window. The door slid open and a boy entered. He sat down opposite the girl.

“I don't want to talk to you,” she said in a constricted voice.

“Why not?”

“Tuney h-hates me. Because we saw that letter from Dumbledore.”

"So what?“

“So she's my sister!”

“She's only a --- ” He broke off.

“But we're going!” he said, unable to suppress the exhilaration in his voice. “This is it! We're off to Hogwarts!”

The girl nodded, smiling slightly.

“You'd better be in Slytherin,” said the boy, encouraged that she had brightened a little.

Remus stopped pretending to read at that. He had tried to ignore his growing interested in the other kid's conversation but it was no use.

„Slytherin?“, asked the girl that had been crying. „But I read that book Professor McGonagall recommended. I‘m not sure I‘ll fit into Slytherin“

„Don‘t say that, I‘m sure you will! We're going to be in Slytherin together and it's going to be great, we‘ll have all our classes together and I can help you out when you struggle---“

Remus caught the girl‘s look, while the boy kept rattling on, and knew he hadn't been wrong when he thought the boy had completely missed the girls point. It wasn't that she didn't think she was going to be good enough for Slytherin, it was that she didn't want to go there.

„Where do you think you‘re going?“, asked the girl when the boy paused to catch his breath.

„Me?“, asked Remus surprised and immediately regretted having shown any interest in the conversation. „Oh. Dunno. My Dad's a Ravenclaw but I don't think I‘ll get in there.“

The boy scoffed.

„What don't think you're smart enough or something?“

He seemed mortally offended that the girl wasn't hanging on his every word. Remus glared at him.

„What's it to you?“

Then he turned back to the girl.

„But where do you want to be?“, she asked. Remus blushed and tried to ignore the boys presence as he said:

„Gryffindor. That's where Professor Dumbledore went“

The girl nodded enthusiastically.

„And Professor McGonagall too! She came to my house to tell me I‘m a witch---“

The boy made a small noise before the girl could continue talking.

„I already knew because of Severus but my parents didn't believe anything I told them before she came over. She seemed so amazing! Like she could come face to face with a whole army and just glare them into giving up. I want to be like that too!“

She beamed at him and Remus smiled back, amazed by how easy it was. Talking to her like a friend.

„But Lily!“, said the boy - Severus - exasperated. „Slytherin is way better! Slytherin‘s are smart and resourceful and ambitious. Gryffindors only get themselves killed trying to prove something.“

Remus had never been particularly good at deciding whether to keep his mouth shut or not in situations and he tended to decide wrong. This was only one of many examples.

„Well, at least Gryffindors wouldn't kill anyone because of their blood status!“

There was no question Remus had just escalated the whole discussion to an entirely new level. Severus was stunned into silence for a moment, trying to gather a counter argument. Remus knew he didn't have a good one - his Dad had told him all about it. Since Lord Voldemort had been on the rise, more and more typical Slytherin-Family children that didn't support his views had ended up in other houses. Kids from families typically in other houses ended up in Slytherin if they supported his views. Slowly but steadily, Slytherin had turned into a gathering place for future death eaters and everyone knew it.

„Sev? What is he talking about?“, asked Lily into the silence.

„Nothing! He‘s talking nonsense!“

„Am I?“, pushed Remus, unsuccessfully willing himself to shut up. „Because five minutes ago you were about to tell Lily her sisters feelings didn't matter because she's a muggle“

Severus paled at that.

„I was-I didn't---“

Lily seemed to replay the conversation in her head.

„You were, weren't you?“, she asked silently.

Severus just squirmed under her gaze - Remus faintly thought that Lily wasn't far off from making army's surrender with a glare.

„You were.“

It was a statement this time.

„What were you talking about? This blood thing?“

„What, you don‘t know?“, Remus blurted out. Lily just looked on expectant.

„I mean...there's an entire war going on about it“

„A what?“, Lily asked slack jawed.

„Uhm yeah. There's this guy, Voldemort, who wants wizards to rule the world and wants to get rid of all muggles and - uhm - muggleborns“, Remus started to talk faster now, wanting to get out of this conversation as fast as he could. „And he kinda was in Slytherin, and pretty much turned the house into his junior club, so you‘d have to be real ignorant to end up there if you really don't agree with him.“

It was vey weird indeed that this first train ride to Hogwarts seemed to have turned into a political discussion. Remus contemplated just running away. It took a moment for Lily to let the words sink in. Then she turned to Severus.

„Is that true?“

„No! I mean-yes-but“, Severus looked around like he was trying to find a good answer lying around.

„It's different with you! You're so talented, the Dark Lord wouldn't care about your blood!“

He had barely finished before Lily had already jumped to her feet.

„ARE YOU KIDDING ME? You want me to join that guy? Someone who wants to --- to kill my family?“

Severus seemed properly cagey by now.

„No-I mean-I‘m sure he wouldn't hurt your family---“

„And the way you‘ve been acting around Petunia? It isn't because you don't like her it's because you think she isn't worth the effort, because she's a muggle!“

Lily looked properly pleading by now, begging her friend to contradict her, but he was just staring, stunned into silence. Lily's gaze turned stone cold and Remus was very glad it wasn't directed at him.

„And there I was thinking that at least when I go to this posh Boarding school I would still have a friend from home that doesn't look down on me for my class. Silly me I guess.“

And with that she turned around and stormed out of the compartment. It only took Remus a few moment to decide to follow her - mainly because he didn't fancy sitting with Severus.

Remus saw Lily disappearing into an compartment not far away and because he didn't know where else to go he followed her. She was once again sitting at the window and her stony gaze had turned watery. He sat down opposite her and dug around his pocket for a chocolate frog. He offered it to her silently and after an encouraging nod she opened it curiously. The frog, having the worst timing possible, decided to make use of its one good jump immediately, almost choking Lily to death, whose mouth had opened in surprise at the moving sweet. After she had caught her breath again the two eleven year olds stared at each other, before dissolving into a fit of giggles.

In the years to come Remus would learn many things about Lily Evans and her peculiarities. One of them being her and forgiveness. She could be very forgiving, maybe too much even. But once you crossed the wrong line it was near impossible to come back. The hat shouting out „RAVENCLAW“ instead of Slytherin for a certain boy wasn't enough to repair their friendship that day. Wasn't even enough to make her think about the possibility of forgiving him. Even though it was enough to change the world.

***** I'm sorry if I came off as a little too defensive. What we know about the Marauders Era is limited and it tends to spark controversy in the fandom, so allow me to illustrate my points.

From what we know of Snape's childhood, he was very poor and wore mismatched ill-fitting clothes, so it's unlikely that his mother was a practicing witch and his desire for magical friends makes it unlikely that he had contact with the Wizarding World or knew of Voldemort and his ideology much less that most of his supporters came from Slytherin. But, even if he did and even if his hatred of his father made him hate all muggles why would he want to kill/enslave them all when he was already escaping to Hogwarts and he could use magic to fight back? Also, a very big part of Voldemort's campaign is the eradication of muggleborns, so if his abusive father was enough to make him hate all muggles, wouldn't the fact that his best friend was, herself, a MB make him respect them? But if he also wanted MBs dead for some reason or thought that killing them was worth it because Voldemort would also kill muggles, would he really as an 11-year-old be able to think that the Dark Lord would keep Lily and her family alive because she is useful, unless Snape was a hyper-intelligent sociopath, then I dont think children think that way.

Then there's Lupin, who was the calmest and kindest of the Marauders, I don't think he would go on to call all Slytherin and all who wanted to be Slytherin, dark wizards and wannabe death eaters after knowing them for 5 minutes, especially since he himself is considered a "Dark" creature and Vody was actually recruiting werewolves at that point, so personally he would be more threatened by the establishment that Voldy was fighting against rather than the man himself. It's mkst likely that he would point out that all Houses have their merits and you don't have to be in the same House as your family.

Then there's Lily. Lily, in cannon, remained friends with Sev despite the fact that he was associating with wannabe DEs and she already had other friends at that point, she only broke it off when she believed he was in too deep to be redeemable, so it's unlikely that she would give up on her only friend at the time from one conversation and wouldn't take him back even after he was Sorted into Ravenclaw which shows he changed his way of thinking. Not to mention in cannon we never get the idea that Snape wants Lily to join the DEs (and no wanting her to be in Slytherin is not the same thing) mich less kill all those like her and her family, because being friends with people who were related to DEs does not mean that Snape completely espoused their philosophy cause if he did Lily would've most likely caught on at some point in their (almost) five years of friendship and cut him out much sooner.

Anyway this is my take, I'm sorry if I offended you before but I really want to know why you wrote this the way you did.

****** Well okay.

Starting with Remus, I‘m really not sure where you got his emotional intelligence from because he really mainly listens to and spreads gossip. His Dad works at the ministry so it makes sense that he would know a little more than most kids about the war and because you should never underestimate how news spread in a workplace like the ministry it makes sense that he knows about how Slytherin changed (which is obviously just my headcanon).

Being a werewolf himself he would obviously feel strongly about the topic and idolising Dumbledore he‘d feel strongly about defending Gryffindor. Snape making that jab about Ravenclaw also feeds into his insecurities so he very much unwisely escalates the conversation by making it about a topic that's very present on his mind at that point. And because he was listening in on the conversation between Lily & Severus he obviously knows what it was about - especially once he gets the context that Lily is muggleborn.

Lily: I kind of was worried I made that one too obvious by making her outright say it, but well. It's a class issue. With the way Cokeworth is presented I always very much interpreted Lily as on the poorer end of working class, only slightly better of than Snape. And even though I'm the first to admit I'm not an expert on the topic I know how much those things make people bond. One of the reasons I see Lily sticking around with Snape in canon for so long is because their from the same place. (I know there are better words to describe what I mean but I can't think of them right now so I just hope it's clear enough). I by the way also see it as a reason for Lily to dislike James so much in the beginning. Because he's your typical old money posh boy and she despises that.

So Severus basically coming around and presenting not only yet another thing to her where people will look down on her for something out of her control, but /also/ being basically on the posh side himself (being not muggleborn) and making clear that he only makes an exception for her but doesn't disagree with the sentiment is practically exactly hitting on her sore point.

On top of that comes his behaviour towards Petunia (things like dropping that tree branch on her and initiating the letter thing) things that Lily before that could interpret as just immaturity and dislike and now turned into bullying because of, once again, class.

Plus, Lily was already upset because of her fight with Petunia and angry at Severus, so finding out those things that put it into perspective are likely to push her over the edge. Especially because they're not yet in Hogwarts, so unlike in canon, she wouldn't be able to play those things off by saying he just got brainwashed by his fellow Slytherins.

Snape: I guess we just have very different interpretations of Snape pre-Hogwarts. His abusive father obviously plays a role, but for me that role is mainly causing Snapes dislike for everything muggle. He would be very receptive for Voldemort's propaganda and not really able to put everything into perspective, see what it means for Lily for example. He's just idolising a guy he sees as someone who would „safe“ him from his muggle father. I imagine reading the daily prophet in that time would be enough to find out about those things and it would be early enough in the war to not have anything too obvious in either direction and just have rich families talking about the dangers of muggles and things like that, instead of reading about plain attacks and stuff. So he‘d get desensitised over time basically.

I‘m sorry that this is all kind of rambling, I‘m not really at a place right now to sit down and write everything well structured and stuff.

******* You have some valid points, I just don't think that Lupin would jump on the "all Slytherin are evil" bandwagon, because he himself knows what it's like to be stereotyped, nor do I think that Snape was aiming to join the DEs before Hogwarts because if he already had such crystalized views then Lily wouldn't have been his friend for so long.

I don't know if you think you can build on this or not, but it's one of those stories for me where I just wanted to read more.

** Remus Lupin, Severus Snape, and Lily Evans sit besides each other on the Hogwarts express, and form a friendship. Ultimately, though, this isn't enough time to change much in the way of housing assignments, and Lupin and Lily proceed to Gryffindor while Snape goes to Slytherin. This does, however, significantly impact the dynamic of the Marauders. Without Lupin, they are less. Sure, Sirius and James are brilliant, and they achieve great things. Pettigrew's there too, of course. But there's no drive. There's no spark. They don't become animagi so they can accompany their werewolf friend, for example. They're gifted, clever students, but they never really reach the heights. They do, however, bully Snape. And without Lupin, who's far more biased against them due to his closer relationship with Snape, their restraint suffers. They become more extreme in their actions, and the relationship between the Marauders-sans-Lupin and Lily, Snape, and Lupin festers deeply.

This only is exacerbated as time goes on. Snape and Lily find out about Lupin's werewolf issue, which does drive them to become better. The brilliance of the Half Blood Prince is enhanced further by Lily's intelligence and ability, and with a real, meaningful reason, and a real, meaningful chip on their shoulder, they achieve more, become greater. Inventing potions, new spells, the like.

However, as the years progress and Voldemort grows in power, things grow more and more strained. Snape's house puts pressure on him due to his friendship with Lily. Lupin being a 'dark creature' weighs over their head, and the treatment of werewolves becomes more and more of a concern. When the werewolves join up with Voldemort, Lupin might seriously consider doing the same. He'd refuse in the end, of course, but the thought would cross his mind.

Then the whole Mudblood incident happens. Severus and Lily's relationship is destroyed. Lupin, caught in the middle, doesn't know what to do, and does the kind of thing that he does in canon. Runs away from the issue without confronting it. The result is that the three of them fall apart. But, let's be optimistic here, and say they get back together somehow. Ultimately, whether they do or don't, one thing's for sure: The relationship between James and Snape is slightly less bad compared to canon, as Snape doesn't nearly die, but the relationship between James and Lily is almost certainly worse. They don't get together.

Snape never ends up joining the Death Eaters due to the stronger bonds between him and Lily and Lupin.

The prophecy never gets leaked to Voldemort, robbing it of it's power as he simply wouldn't know about it, and thus wouldn't care. There's no miracle to fulfill the specific conditions of Lily's sacrifical protection. Voldemort never loses power. Dumbledore never finds out about the Horcruxes.

Voldemort wins, and since Snape, Lupin, and Lily aren't on his side, they die, along with James, Sirius, Dumbledore, and many, many others.

*** It might also be possible to thwart the Mudblood incident too because Lupin was a prefect and he might try to help Snape like Lily did. I agree with you on the ending wholeheartedly, many people seem to forget that, terrible as it might sound, Lily's death was necessary for Voldemort's eventual demise. By all accounts, it seemed like Voldemort was winning the war, not the other way around.

**** I agree - and further, while I don't think that Snape is a good person, he was the reason Lily was given the opportunity to exchange her live for Harrys. Voldemort wouldn't have asked her to step aside if Snape hadn't begged for her live. And while that's only a theory I am convinced that that was the reason why Harry was able to survive. Because James also gave his live and I am sure there are many other mothers and fathers that died for their children - but only Lilys death overcame the killing curse. And as far I know the main difference is that she actually was given a choice.

Sirius, James, and Peter are still friends with Remus but it's not the same

** Now I'm just picturing, James and Sirius Pulling some rather mean pranks on Remus In their first year when they learn they are sharing a dorm room Peter doesn't really make friends with any of the three and instead to hangs out With some random Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaw Peter still ends up idolizing James but from like more of a distance more like a stalker than a friend. And well Severus still ends up in Slytherin I and Lily and in Gryffindor. But they see each other in classes and it's just kind of James and Sirius Become a bit cooler crueler As the years go on until about third year. When Lily and Severus have a rather public fight because well several spendseverus spent a bit more time with Lucius than expected...with Remus Heading out with them a bit... Severus tells Remus about his interest in demfesne against the dark arts And somehow Remus tells Severus about his very little problem. Lily also involved in the conversation... I'm picturing a deserted trophy room after lights out but with James and Sirius Under the clothes in the corner. Listening without the other occupants in the room knowing about them they followed them intending to pull a prank but instead are privy to read Mrs.remus Biggest secret. But instead of excepting him Severus freaks a bit and ends up calling Remus a Mongrel And Lily after a heated argument a mud blood. Somehow Snape ends up raising his one to his two former friends, But instead of being of you assholes about it James and Sirius tackle Snape While Remus tries tos shiedld Really because himself and Lily Oh whofor some reason doesn't have her wand. And whether rather an awkward conversation ensued between The fairest thank you doingBetween the nefarious prank in Deuelduo a dremusremusand Lily a Negotiations if you will Basically Lily gets blackmailed into going on a date with James that goes about as well as can be expected. And Remus well He ends up tutoring Sirius in ancient runes.James somehow gets one of the older students to modify Snape's memory through some kind of blackmail, And for the rest of their deer things stand as a rather awkward truce truce With Lily a reluctant girlfriend To an arrogant thatprat And Remus helpin ghelping James and Sirius Create the marauders map.Eventually after that end of year then something else happens that I haven't figured out yet and the reluctant truthtruce Becomes a bit more like a begrudging respect and eventually friendship as they approach the end of their fourth year. James stops forcing Lily to date him around the end of third year after she punches him in the face repeatedly and ends up having a small emotional breakdown where Remus threatens him at wantd point And Lily goes to the hospital wing to get her knuckles treated while James does the same thing but lies and says he fell down the stairs. At which point James realizes how much of an asshole he was and they have a talk while they both end up drinking that horrific bone re-growing potion and spend the night in the hospital wing. Somehow in their fourth year they end up a bit more friendly thethoug Lilith Still can't stand James but doesn't want to physically throttle him and he isn't asking her out every five minutes. Eventually they come to tolerate each other though James is still in love with her. But a bit more respectful about it after the beat down he received at her hands.By the end of their fourth year Remus and Lily are sitting in nearly every class with James and Sirius And conspiring with them on a few things like trying to find out what the hell is going on with the Slytherin.

There is a few more events in between I just haven't figured them out yet
