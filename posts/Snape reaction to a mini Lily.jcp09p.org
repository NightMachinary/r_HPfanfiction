I'm using my free time from work to have fun thinking about interesting fic plots to be developed in the future. one of the ideas is a fem!H who looks like Lily. I really love the idea for the lack of existing options. but Snape's character blocks me because I don't know what to do with him in this situation and I cannot write about her without him. I have thought of many options but some seem scary and others unrealistic or uninteresting. I never wrote fics before... (maybe i'm too old for that? Lol). I have also thought about making him ignore her 24/7 but this is a lazy way out, right? the book Snape seems to be someone with emotions on the verge of exploding. Can someone who knows well him give any suggestions please?? thank you

*if I put something from James there for sure is the hair color. And a little different personality for her also


** I am not an expert on fanfics but I know that there is no right age to have fun :) That's about it, fun. I understand that you must be a perfectionist and are looking to do a good job but fics are fun and there are always those who will criticize your story or shout that it is disgusting or that you are sick, but these same people will not miss an update of the controversial story that they pretend to ignore. You can't please everyone honey. The story is YOURS. how do you think he would react? The canon gives us a man who is mentally unstable, immature, tends to project the past into the present, full of open wounds and who is crazy for forgiveness, a little understanding and clearing of conscience. How does this hurt man react to this girl? if you think it is scary or disturbing just write and let the haters curse you, because if they do it is because they have lost an entire day reading your work.

I don't know if that helps... good luck!

** My spin on it is this: I assume that since Snape can brew some of the most complex potions and can even improve them, he is very meticulous. So he would assess if your character's personality. As a matter of fact, my headcanon is that that's exactly what he does in PS when he asks Harry all those questions in the first Potions class. He already knows that everyone talks about mini-James, but Lily, being unfamiliar with the magical world, would have at least read all her textbooks before the start of the term (which Harry didn't).

I would think that being closer in looks to Lily, he'd show at least some veiled affection (not in the creepy way) towards your character or at least may be a little more lenient and understanding than with canon Harry, regardless of the outcome. But I think that if Snape would assess that your character's personality is closer to Lily's, he'd show favoritism to her but it would be a silent one since Voldemort can still forcefully penetrate minds even if you try to block him with occlumency and would not look good if you, as supposedly his loyal servant, were very kind or close to his enemy.

*** But Harry /did/ read them (or at least looked at them and we know what he had to do to try and read about magic at the Dursleys), he just didn't knew them by heart or read books from upper years.

Snape is a deeply unfair man and that was just the first example.

**** I am not interested in debating our interpretation of an interaction in a work of fiction. I see it my way and you yours. I gave OP my thoughts and you should do so too if you plan to contribute to this thread.

Edit: wasn't downvoting a way to indicate that the user does not contribute to the thread? I gave my opinion and the one above me wanted to bait me in an argument about our interpretation of Snape. While he may not be a beloved character around here, at least I contributed to the thread. I did not attempt to change anyone's mind and I do not appreciate people trying to change my mind without good reason.
