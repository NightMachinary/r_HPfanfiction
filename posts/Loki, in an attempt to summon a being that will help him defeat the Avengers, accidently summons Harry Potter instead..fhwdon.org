******** It's okay, I understand. While I haven't read snake satan be4, the slash part I understand. I don't have anything against it, I just don't prefer it if it's the main pairing or Harry himself. The one slash fic I ever voluntarily read was Descent Into Darkness by Athy. It's LV x HP and it's amazing. The build up of Harry being fed up during the Tri-Wizard tournament to him finally joining Voldemort is unbelievably well written. Yeah there are splashy lemons but they're well written enough that I, a hetero male, might of gotten just a wee bit ^{horny.}

It's no longer on FanFiction.Net or AO3 but it's still on hp.adult-fanfiction.org under the same title by the same person. A definite read: 11/10

********* Honestly it's not the slash itself, I read /plenty/ of that in other fandoms. Give me some cute and fluffy slash about two guys running a coffee shop, or two gritty soldiers fighting in a war any day, the problem for me are the slash targets.

Like, Snake Satan, Snape, Draco and Draco Senior make up 98% of all slash in this community, and every single one of these /physically makes me sick/. One is Literally Hitler, one is a greasy, 40 year old man who is so twisted and nasty inside it actually makes me nauseous in the real world, one is an actual murderer and a death eater and just generally extremely evil, and the other one is the equivalent of the dude who runs around a school and calls all the black students the N-word and all the asian students the c-word.

All this extends into crossovers too, mind you. For example, the most common slash target in a LOTR crossover is /fucking Legolas/. Aka mister haughty-taughty fuckboy who is pretty much the most unlikeable guy of the entire universe after his even more snobbish asshole of a father.

*********** Oh, I agree with that, but most slash crossovers pair him up before that happens. His entire character arc is that he transforms from haughty prince into likeable dude, but only once he's Likeable Dude should he actually be paired up. Isn't the whole point of his character that nobody can stand him in the beginning?

********** There's an excellent long-running series that's slowly chipping away at my dislike of Snarry, but I have to agree: becoming physically nauseous is a thing, and I had to start frantically skipping pages because NO. A million words later (and no, that's not an exaggeration) and it's less frantic, but even though I adore the story and can handle - and sometimes even appreciate - the 'sweet' moments in regards to the relationship, its those thankfully rare intimate scenes that I still can't do.

I feel like a huge part of why I can't handle the pairing 99.9% of the time is purely visual though. The one snarry story that I religiously/obsessively follow does a good job at putting my objections to Snape's character at rest. But you know what? I saw the damn movies, and that actor, at that age, and in that costume? I do not want to read about his dick, thanks.

And try as I might, I can't not see that actor as Snape.

*********** I have the advantage of not having watched the movies since I was very young (they are very good from what I remember, but the general crookedness, smallness and dirtiness of the depicted wizarding world really clashes with the images I built while reading), so I don't really remember all that well how the various characters looked.

I've been basing my internal image of these people on the books and various fanfictions, and those images are colored by their personalities. I'll never see TMR as anything else than a hairless, red-eyed, scaly abomination, or Snape as anything other than a slightly hunched-over dude with dirty, greasy Smeagol hair and a permanent frown.

  Harry Potter had never really managed a normal, peaceful Halloween, so he really shouldn't have been surprised when he was suddenly displaced from the grocery store and found himself in front of a maniacally cackling man in a very dramatic outfit.
