** The thing about fighting scenes is that fighting (on paper at least) is really boring. It's repetitive, hard to visualize, and really ends up dragging on to the point that the reader just skims. Rather, the fight scene needs to serve the plot beyond a simple fight. Really that boils down to two things:

1. Reason
2. Consequence

If there's no reason for the fight to happen, then don't include it. Harry and Voldemort shooting some spells at each other because they haven't shot some spells at each other in a while doesn't move your plot forward. It just ups your word count. More interesting is if the fight exists to move the plot forward. Maybe your character is trying to break their best friend out of a prison, and there's a guard in the way. Or perhaps your character's friends are breaking into the Department of Mysteries, and the protagonist needs to distract the death eaters for a few minutes. Then the fight becomes important beyond the action. Without this, even a perfectly written fight is completely uninteresting.

The second part of a good fight is consequence. If after your awesome battle nothing's really changed, then what was the point? Why not just cut out the fight and move on with the fic? More interesting is when the fight changes something. A injured leg that gets in the way two chapters down the line. Or a friend dies and the rest of the characters have a hard time dealing with it. It's these types of things that make a fight impactful, not the arcane magic and massive battles (although that doesn't mean you shouldn't include those).

Once you've taken care of those two, you can move on to writing the action well. The first thing to note (which is true of all writing) is that a fight scene has to avoid getting too slow/boring. So, use very physical words. Smashed, swung, slashed, heaved. Keep it personal. Make the reader feel every blow and every curse. And make sure the emotions come through in your character's actions. A scrambling fighter is terrified. A man who's smashing a bottle is murderous. I don't want you to tell me the character's in pain. I want to feel the curse eviscerate his legs, and I want to feel him screaming under the Cruciatus. And if you can get across those emotions across to the reader, your fighting will be successful.

I'll add to this since it appears to be implied though not said, when writing a scene centred on action, use those physical words in sentences that are simple, quick to read, short. To write action means to simulate the tempo of action, the experiences, and this means that whoever is narrating the story for the reader does not have time to reach for a thesaurus or form elaborate sentences, and thus the readers do not get a thesaurus trip nor elaborate word-flow. When a character screams from pain, don't write a whole sentence about it, tackle it onto a sentence that says what he's already doing a moment later because he does not have time to stop just because he screams and thus neither do the readers (the exception being situations where something completely incapacitates the character who can now do nothing other than scream, in which case the fact that there actually is a sentence dedicated just to it will make it all the more of a swerve for the readers when you don't stop for that in most fights). What takes three pages in normal writing, unless your style is already short and simple and quick should take no more than about one page when writing an action scene.

** I write from the POV of a character, so I try to focus on what a character would focus in a fight: Not too many details, not much outside the immediate threats, unless there's an opportunity to observe more.

** I find fighting scenes particularly boring when they don't include a dialogue. Whether it's a discussion (like Dumbledore and Voldemort at the Ministry), a character monologuing between spells, or just banter like Sirius and Bella, the actual interaction makes the scene much more interesting.

** Have a look at the below, i'm sure you'll find an approach that suits your style.

** Don't go full hand to hand combat like many authors. In reality, if someone runs at you in the wizarding world you can just hit them with a spell.

** Fight scenes reflect the characters doing the fighting, and will flow depending on their personal reasons for fighting, and also on your word choice and sentence structure. I often liken it to writing a sex scene, actually. If Harry and Voldemort are duelling, the way they do so should in some way reflect either their personal clash or the moral conflict of the story as a whole. If it were Andromeda and Bellatrix duelling (just for example, work with me here) it should develop their characters and their relationship, for better or worse. They're sisters, and they used to know each other very well, so such a fight should reflect the emotional baggage of their wider relationship as sisters. Like... talking with wands, if you will, and things would probably get extremely vocal. If, instead, Harry and Voldemort are still fighting into Harry's thirties for instance, they might not even need to talk any more. Fighting the other has become so natural that they know what the other will do almost before they do it, which can be almost intimate in nature, even if they hate each other with every fibre of their being. For the record, I don't actually ship HPLV at all, and the thought kinda squicks me, but it's a dynamic I've seen work with other villain/hero shippings. Most notably KiGo, but I digress.

On the other hand, if the characters /don't/ know each other before a fight, e.g. Harry vs Voldemort in GoF, then you can use the way the characters behave when threatened to subtly hint to their worldview, or play up the tension between the characters with manoeuvering and standoffs. If they don't know each other, that makes each character seem more unpredictable in the other's eyes, so split-second decisions are made on shoddy information and it's more likely for someone to be caught completely off guard. Lord Voldemort is headstrong and sure in his own superiority, and his dynamic with Harry is very different to his dynamic with Dumbledore, yet those character traits still come through in both situations.

There's an ebb and flow to dramatic fight scenes, and dialogue can be very important, but don't have them stop to explain their abilities to each other, because that completely breaks the flow of a fight, not to mention being a boring anime clich√©. If these are enemies that know each other well, they may communicate via body language instead (again mirroring the sex-scene analogy). If they don't, subtle hints to body language is still super important, because it adds a certain ambiguity to a character's actions. 'What is Voldy going to try next?' sort of thing.

** - Have a good idea of where they are fighting; is it a room? Is it a field? Is it a corridor? This has a direct effect on the fighters in question-things like lighting, cover, ammunition and bystanders depend on where you are going to stage a fight. If it's a room, what's in it? If it's a corridor, how long until someone is likely to come along? If it's a field, is it covered in short/tall grass? Are there trees or animals anywhere? Are there holes in the ground that can make a character lose their footing? What?

- A fight is not a duel; the fighters aren't slugging it out on a flat plane. There's plenty of things that can provide cover, break line of sight, surprise the protagonist/enemy etcetera.

-Fighting is a dirty and painful business; someone's going to get hurt and it's going to hurt a lot. That should be reflected in the fight itself-any blow sustained by the fighters doesn't get walked off. Adrenaline or not, bruises and wounds slow the fighters down and distract them at critical moments.

-Just because they're fighting doesn't mean they aren't thinking; the fighters will be focused on one thing-taking down the enemy. There are plenty of different ways to do that. Figuring out how to do so whilst sustaining minimal damage/inflicting maximum damage on the enemy is something they'll be focusing on during the fight.

-Terrain dictates both tactics and weaponry/spell repertoire; using a grenade in a tightly enclosed space is suicide. So is swinging a claymore in a narrow alleyway. The fighters will have to adapt their fighting styles and ideas to suit the area around them.

-Have escape as an option; not all battles are fought to the bitter end. Some finish when one of the contestants manages to quit the field.

-A fight doesn't isolate the fighters from the Universe; shit's still going on elsewhere. If the fight spills over into an occupied area, the reactions of the spectators can well turn the fight around.

-Talking is a bad idea; Seriously, not a free action when you're rigorously beating the other fellow into a pulp.

-Know the weapons you are using; Be it a gun, a sword or a shield-figure out how the character is likely to use their weapon, accomodate the weight & length of said weapon during an engagement and capitalise on its strengths/weaknesses.

-Nobody's perfect; they don't all know Kung Fu or manage a bullet spread that'd put a sniper to shame. They don't all know how to turn a can of chili into mace or the x number of areas they're supposed to aim for. They can't all read an opponent's intent by the positioning of their feet and the flare of their nostrils. They're going to make mistakes and pay for said mistakes. They could lose or, if plot armoured, get the shit kicked out of them in the pursuit of inevitable victory. Guns will have their safeties still on, knives will tangle in their hiding places rather than slide out smoothly, swords will catch in scabbards and cocking rounds into the rifle will jam a thumb in the process. They're in a fight-clear thinking is not assured at all, shit's stressful and only extreme familiarity with either the weapon or the dance is going to keep them from basically fumbling at the exact wrong time-though even that's not an option. Oh, and dodging. Dodging's good, but gets painful when you dodge onto debris-strewn surfaces.

-Fighting is exhausting; between the stress, the injuries, things going wrong, running and dodging and fighting and almost dying, it won't take long for someone to tire in a fight.

- Shit breaks; furniture, people, tech, you name it-one stray attack and the room will be minus a couch for a while.

-FOR MAGIC: speed and mobility are both factors here. Ultra-complex spells that can flay an army alive but take five seconds to cast are out as the enemy will have flung five separate spells at them within said five seconds. Standing still whilst fighting is suicide, but casting spells on the run is not by any means a practiced thing. So the fighters are likely to stick to the basics until they're confident enough or have enough space to try something smart. Anything that has more than two or three wand movements is likely to not work-or backfire-in a fight.

Case in point-how come Voldemort spams the AK curse in battle? Because it's a) easy to cast, b) one shot, one kill upon connection and c) hikes up his enemies's stress levels considerably.

Same thing for Harry's /expelliarmus/, the reductor curse and so many others-simple movements, appreciable effects and rapid-fire capable.

Mobility is also heavily contested here, given the existence of apparition, portkeys and floo powder. They who dominate the field dominate the battle in this case.
