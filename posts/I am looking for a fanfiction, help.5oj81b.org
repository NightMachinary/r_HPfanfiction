I read this fanfiction long ago: the Death Eaters won the First War and took control of Hogwarts. Harry is still the BWL, and befriends Hermione in Hogwarts. I remember one particular scene where one of the Carrows was the professor of the Dark Arts and she forced Harry to torture Hermione with the cruciatus curse. And in one point McGonagall tells Harry that James joined the Death Eaters, bur later betrayed them. Any ideas?


** Can't entirely remember the details of what happened in this one but perhaps Stranger? It's one where Harry accidentally travels to an alternate dimension where the death eaters won and Voldemort was the Minister at least. Though I think Dumbledore was still headmaster so perhaps not.

  Harry Potter was 'defeated' by Voldemort at the Battle of Hogwarts and awakens in another dimension - one where prejudice is law and the Dark Lord reigns supreme. With no way to return, Harry tries to find his place in a world far different from his own. When familiar faces don new roles, will Harry succeed in fitting in, or will he always remain a stranger?
