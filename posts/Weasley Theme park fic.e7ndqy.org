:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey Reddit! Trying to track down an AO3 Drarry fic that I read a while ago (2018/early 2019) that I can't seem to track down through the history or tag system.

Premise: George and his family decide to open a Wheezes theme park, Harry and Draco pitch in and they become friends etc. Pretty long if I remember and lots of bacon sandwich eating? It was definitely a theme park but this search term conflicts with WWOHP which makes fic hunting hard!

Anyone else read this?

  In which Draco is completely out of his depth (until he isn't), Harry builds something improbable with the help of his friends, and everyone bonds over food.
