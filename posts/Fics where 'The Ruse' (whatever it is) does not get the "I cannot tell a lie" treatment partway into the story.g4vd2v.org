Preferably long so that I can kill a decent amount of time In-Q.

The Rigel Black series by murkybluematter (FF. net) is a great example of The Ruse continuing on to its logical extremes with logical consequences. It's fun.

A Necessary Gift: a Harry Potter story by Cosette_Aimee (AO3) is the best example I have, at present, where an interesting Ruse is constructed and briefly employed and then THROWN AWAY half a chapter later because 'guilt'. It's disappointing and lazy.


** Well, in my story "Harry Potter and the Lady Thief", the ruse (the identity of the thieves) is kept up for a long time.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

**** I'm sure there is, but I don't enjoy stories with Harry as the big damn hero and Ron and Hermione sidelined, so I don't know.
