I mean, I've read plenty of stories where Hogwarts' defense class is shown as pitiful at best, or where Harry finds a way of dropping out of Potions/divination somehow, so is there some where he ups and decides that he can spend his time in better things than struggling through Quirrel's stuttering, Lockhart's Lockhartness, Moody's seemingly insensitivity to him and Neville, Umbridge's /literally everything/ and Snape's pettiness?


** Conditionally by Lomonaaeren (Severitis); he doesn't take it in 6th year.

#+begin_quote
  Snape steps in front of him and snarls under his breath, “/Why/ are you not in my class?”

  “Because you're a terrible professor.”

  Snape stands still. Oddly, Harry thinks that no one might have said that to him before. People are probably subtler when they try to challenge him or get him to pay attention and change his behavior.

*** Oh, I remember reading that one, though I had forgotten he dropped defense, thanks anyway. PS.: for anyone else reading that is in doubt, in that one Harry is *not* paired with Snape.

**** I did say it was Severitis. That means Harry is Snape's biological son. Them being paired would be just... no.

** I get the impression that, up to fifth year, DADA is a core class. There's certain subjects you /legally/ have to take up to fifth year of secondary school in England, and Hogwarts is clearly built on the English private school model. Even subjects that aren't a legal requirement, schools can insist they're core topics up until you've done your GCSEs (or OWLs in wizard school). For example, I legally had to study maths, English and some combination of the three sciences until I was sixteen. My school then, on top of that, mandated us to take one language, on technology class, and one humanity. So everyone had a minimum of six core classes. I get the impression that in wizard school, DADA, Transfiguration, Charms, Potions, History and Herbology were core class up to OWL, so dropping it not an option.

As for why he doesn't drop it at NEWT- he knew he had to take it to be an auror. And even in a fic where Harry doesn't want to be a wizardcop, he's still probably going to want to protect himself against Voldemort. And plus, Snape is an arsehole who hates Harry, but he isn't actually an incompetent teacher. And Harry probably wants the opportunity to spy on Snape too.

There are a couple of fics I've read where he self studies DADA in second year because Lockhart is, well, Lockhart. I think it was a Severitus and he shows Snape the quiz about what is Lockhart's favourite colour and so on, and Snape's like "fuck that, you can study in my office in those lessons from a curriculum I'll set you rather than waste your time."

Maybe not in DADA, but he was definitely an incompetent potions teacher. "Instructions are on the board, get started," is NOT teaching. He never demonstrated techniques, gave safety lectures, or critiqued their methods. (Note that I said critique, not criticize. He certainly did the latter but never the former.)

**** True, but, counterpoint.

When Snape was putting the instructions on the board, they were his modified instructions with improvements and so on. He never taught from the book, he taught from his own recipes. Hermione always did well. As soon as Slughorn starts teaching and it's from the book, Hermione isn't doing so well. The only person getting good results is Harry, because he's still got access to Snape's modified instructions...

So the information Snape gave, even as a Potions teacher, was still superior to the information Slughorn was giving and he got better results than Sluggy, even though the latter has better "bedside manner" or whatever you'd call the teaching equivalent.

Really? I don't remember anything like that in canon. He's always having them read their books (and writing essays) for homework. So unless he found a better book than the one he used, or wrote his own, I don't think his improvements are anywhere except whatever he's published in potions journals. When Slughorn comes back to teach, he uses the exact same book that was used back when Snape was a student.

(And I've just realized that Hogwarts uses outdated books for what is essentially a science class. Can you imagine a current-day school using science books that haven't been updated in 20 years?)

*** Good points, though still would like to see a story where he just ups and decides that he can't be paid enough to tolerate Umbridge or Lockhart, potentially he just decides to do self-study and take the exams, saw him doing that for electives in some stories.

Yeah, Snape is probably the most skilled defense practitioner they ever had and the third best teacher (and isn't that a sad prospect?) of DADA, plus for all his faults Harry /did/ manage to get an EE in potions on his OWLs. But he also probably wasn't keen on having Snape as a teacher after the occlumency disaster the previous year, and this if he even /knew/ Snape was going to teach that year, for all we know he didn't get told it until the welcoming feast, so he could have potentially just looked at the track-record of DADA teachers and decided to cut his losses after his OWLs.
