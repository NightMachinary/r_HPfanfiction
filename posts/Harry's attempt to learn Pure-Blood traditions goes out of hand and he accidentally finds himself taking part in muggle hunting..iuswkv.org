Fanfics like to pretend that there are lots of Pure-Blood etiquette and traditions Harry is supposed to learn to really fit in, and has him take lessons from people like Daphne, Draco or Neville.

In canon there really isn't such a thing, though we do know that blood purists do have some rather vile traditions, like the Blacks who use the decapitated heads of their house-elves as decoration or like the title mentions, Muggle-Hunting.

This prompt is basically what if Harry tries to learn Pure-Blood traditions, imagining them to be like in fanfics, but accidentally signals death eater families that he's interested in their ways and unintentionally ends up taking part in a muggle hunt. Like maybe they just refer to it as going hunting and assume he knows what they mean when they invite him to join them.


** Draco sneered, "Look at those fools using brooms, Potter. Disgusting. I say if they didn't come from good stock, I'd call them blood traitors."

"What's wrong with brooms, Malfoy?" Harry asked, nervous at how many people seemed to have turned up to hunt some pheasants. He'd only brought a wand, figuring that a good stunner would bring them down.

"A real wizard hunts muggles while respecting our ancestors. That's why father and I shall be hunting on our Abraxans," Draco said, still looking with contempt at the Mulcibers who sat on brooms sharpening various implements and testing some spells.

"Muggles?!" Harry asked, eyes widened.

"Of course Potter, what could be a more traditional sport? You did say you wanted to learn more about our traditions to Daphne, no?"

*** Harry pondered for a moment. On one hand, this was a cruel, inhumane sport. On the other, he wanted to get into Daphne's pants. And, really, it would be terribly rude of him to back out now. "Sure, Malfoy. Do you think you could lend me an Abraxan?"

** It is, of course, unsporting to just hit a Muggle with a spell. One must root the Muggle out, give chase, and leave the kill to the crups.

** Depending of how it is done I could even see Harry turning their attention to the Dursley's instead of some random and innocent muggle and /then/ going full Bellatrix on them with such a glee that /everyone else/ gets a little terrified.

** Plot twist: when they "catch" muggles, it's "catch and release, with a side of /obliviation/."

They're terrified when Harry (swallowing nervously, not that they see that) tries to act confident and asks when they're going to kill them, or slit their throats, or something.

** I don't know what's cannon or fannon but I love angst so you could go all out angst and give Harry a full on panic attack because it gives him flashbacks to when Dudley and his lackeys liked to go harry hunting.
