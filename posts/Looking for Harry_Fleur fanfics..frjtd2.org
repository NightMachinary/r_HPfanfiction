***** It's a neat fic with some really interesting ideas I've not seen before or after.

It's been a very long time since I read it, but I recall very much liking Dumbledore's characterization.

Keep in mind that it's sort of a 'Lie I've Lived' situation- the fic is /technically/ complete, but there's very clearly space for a sequel that never materialized.

**** I tried to be as tasteful as possible. Most of the focus of the story is on the effects, rather than the actual abuse, but there are detailed sections yes. Chapters 13 and 14 both have trigger warnings. I tried hard not to venture into the ridiculous abuse you sometimes see in fics.

I know it's not everyone's cup of tea.

**** There are a few chapters with trigger warnings, where the abuse is shown - but mostly it deals more with the emotional aftereffects.

There are a few chapters with trigger warnings - Chapters 13 and 14 have him at the Dursleys during the summer, and the abuse is considered heavier than normal because he ran away to see the Quidditch World Cup.\\
At the end of Chapter 14, Harry gets removed from the Dursley household. After that, logically, no more abuse would happen.\\
Chapters 30 and 31 deal with Fleur being tortured by Death Eaters, and aftereffects of the methods used.

EDIT: For those of you looking at this thread a month after it was posted, there are some more trigger warnings than when I first made this post. I've added them in.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** I liked Hogwarts Battle School linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School]]) for Harry/Fleur. It's a very heavy AU. Imagine Ender's Game but shoved into the HP universe. Really liked the action and intrigue stuff in the work.

Jbern's Lie I've Lived linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived]]) is also an interesting H/F story, mainly because Harry inherits all of his father's memories the summer after 3rd year.

For Gabrielle/Harry, there's Vitam Paramus. It's a post-war fic where Harry is a professional quidditch player. Just note that while they are the two main characters, they are not together for the majority of the fic. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9444529/1/]])
