** [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/aemom5/request_a_story_where_the_majority_of_hogwarts/][Previously Asked Here]]

Here was my response then:

--------------

Every entering class at Hogwarts was expected to show a heavy dose of anxiety - a mixture of homesickness, excitement about learning magic, and the fear and anticipation of making new friends.

But this group... there was something wrong with this group, McGonagall thought. They almost all showed a nervous, silent reserve that one normally associated with adults in uncomfortable social situations rather than keyed-up children. When the ghosts appeared in the hall, there were no exclamations of surprise or fear. None. That had never happened once in all her years at Hogwarts. Even the Muggleborns stared placidly at the ghosts, with only the Granger girl and young Harry showing any surprise at all.

As she lead the group into the main hall, she saw lots of gaping mouths and wide eyes, reassuring her somewhat. Okay, so this was a weirdly reserved group of 11 year olds, but they could still show surprise and delight upon entering Hogwarts for the first time.

She caught a number of students with their gazes fixed fiercely on the staff table. Following the line of vision, it looked like nearly a quarter of the group was staring at Professor Quirrel with predatory focus. Another quarter seemed transfixed by Severus with the remainder glancing around, constantly stealing looks at Harry and the Weasley boy.

She gave her head a little shake and told herself to stop wool-gathering. There was a sorting to get through.

--------------

Hermione Granger was happier than she'd ever been in her short life. From the moment she set foot on the Hogwarts express, she was absolutely mobbed by students all eager to be her friend. These two Muggleborn boys, Justin something and Kevin Entwhistle, had found her on Platform 9 3/4 and stuck to her like glue all day.

First they helped her get her luggage settled and then kept peppering her with questions about her life, her family, her magic, her... well, everything! They laughed at her jokes and were incredibly impressed with the magic she was able to do on the train.

They were trying out some charms on the train and Justin was pronouncing the incantation wrong. She very well knew she tended to be incredibly bossy but she just couldn't help herself - she sharply corrected him.

A moment of silence filled the air. Hermione was sure she'd gone and screwed everything up, and they hadn't even arrived at the school! Then Kevin burst out laughing so hard he could barely speak, coughing out "IT'S LEVI-OH-SAH!" at the top of his lungs.

A jolt went through Justin. He dropped his wand and stared, open-mouthed at Kevin. Kevin finally caught his breath and saw Justin staring, having gone pale as a sheet. His lips moved silently.

"What was that?" Kevin asked, still recovering from his freakish laughing fit.

Justin whispered, "No Ron, it's not levi-oh-sah it's levi-oh-sah."

And then Kevin dropped his wand. What the hell?!? It was the weirdest thing she'd seen since entering this strange, magical world.

"Oh my god," Kevin all but whispered back. "You too?"

Justin gave a little nod and recited something in this weird chopped cadence, something that sounded like a rehearsed litany: "Diadem Diary, Cup and Ring, Locket, Snake, Harry."

Kevin hissed his response. Something urgent, the way he was leaning into Justin, but it was too quiet for Hermione to make out.

Not a moment later, the door to their compartment banged open, a pair of girls standing there.

"Oh my god, are you Hermione Granger!?" the Indian one all but screamed. And then she had four friends.

Despite the weirdness, Hermione was SO looking forward to the next seven years.

--------------

Any idiot could tell that there was something profoundly wrong with this group of children. Without even his astute mind or mastery of the mind art, Severus mused. He'd indulged himself with skimming along the surface of the Potter brat's mind and found nothing amiss. The barest glance inside the minds of the students on either side of him - a Weasley and some buck-toothed girl that was obviously Muggle-born - also showed the typical childish eagerness and anxiety.

It was a puzzle that only temporarily distracted Severus from his usual mental pastimes - designing new potions in his head and wallowing in a chest-deep pool of regret.

His mind was well on its way to sussing out an improvement to the wit-sharpening potion that would reduce addictiveness by 10% of more when a little first-year student at the Slytherin table suddenly stood up on his bench and proceeded to kick aside food and stand on the table.

What the hell did the Crabbe boy think he was doing?! Severus started to rise from his seat when the boy's voice belted out across the great hall:

"Okay, how many of you are self-inserts?!"

The absurdity of his question was met by a momentary silence. A beat later it was broken by a voice at the Hufflepuff table, "holy shit."

Two Hufflepuff boys looked at each other and immediately stood up. One raised his hand and then clambered up onto the table, "Quick show of hands to answer Crabbe's question!" his tone of voice held that slow, easy cadence of someone used to being obeyed.

Severus was now fully standing and was about to interrupt this farce when hands started going up all over the hall.

The entire first year class.

All of them.

Wait, no. Severus noted several confused students at the Gryffindor table. Potter, the Longbottom heir, and Potter's two friends all looked completely confused. A moment's glance around the hall showed only Malfoy similarly bewildered.

Severus opened his mouth, drawing in a breath in order to intervene. Before he could, the Hufflepuff boy continued speaking.

"Alright folks, keep your mouths shut. No running off to the Chamber of Secrets or the Room of Requirement until we've got a chance to talk things over," the boy seemed to pause for the barest moment before suddenly exlaiming, "Oh shit, who's got Scabbers?!"

The improbable question was answered by a boy at the Gryffindor table standing up, holding a... rat? "Ron sold me Scabbers. I'm gonna keep him very safe and very well fed, okay guys?!" the rat-wielder glanced around the room, giving all the "self-insert" students a look whose meaning was lost on Severus.

"Mr. Entwhistle," Albus spoke, the old man finally intervening. "I think it would be best if..."

The little Hufflepuff git interrupted the Headmaster: "Albus, you need to clear the room right now of everyone except the first-years and Severus. Maybe Minerva."

How dare he?! "That's fifty points from Hufflepuff, and how dare you interrupt the -"

"Take your fucking points and shove them up your ass, Snivellus. This concerns a certain Riddle that the Headmaster is trying to solve and us first-years are going to help him."

That proclamation was met with an uproar of shouts, laughs, and... were some of the self-insert students complaining or objecting? What the hell is going on here?

The Headmaster had eyes locked on the Hufflepuff boy. He'd gone completely still.

Levering himself up, the Headmaster coughed lightly to clear his throat. "It seems that Hogwarts is host to some remarkable happenings this year. Prefects, please lead all students back to their dorms, except first years. All first years please remain seated. Heads of House, please remain as well. The staff is likewise dismissed."

Entwhistle turned and immediately spoke into the silence that followed Dumbledore's proclamation. "Someone get the map from the twins."

*** Pomona Sprout liked to think of herself as unflappable. The rock upon which the House of Hufflepuff was maintained. Her matronly demeanor was simply one tool in her arsenal, one she carefully cultivated. There was no problem that couldn't be solved with teamwork, focus, and tons of gumption.

But... this...

This.

She was no longer unflappable. She was thoroughly flapped.

She'd barely remembered to draw breath for the past fifteen minutes, much less participate in the discussion. One of her little badgers, Kevin Entwhistle, had spent the past fifteen minutes ordering around Severus and the Headmaster! He demanded something called a "muffliato," which was apparently a form of privacy charm. How on earth on Muggle-born had heard of charm invented by Severus, she had no idea.

He'd then referenced Alastor Moody by first name, and ordered the Headmaster to apply enough privacy wards and charms to satisfy "that paranoid old cyclops."

When Albus had suggested retiring to his office to continue the discussion between just the two of them, Mr. Entwhistle had casually refused, asserted that he was merely acting as the spokesman for the group, and affirmed that collective bargaining was the bedrock of all meaningful social change.

There was something of a hub-bub going on amongst the children:

"Goddammit, Susan, shut the fuck up. You're speaking out of turn!"

"I told you, my name is Caleb. I don't care if I'm stuck in the body of an 11 year old girl."

Miss Abbot whacked the Bones girl on the back of the head hard enough to send a resounding smack through the nearly-empty Great Hall. Hannah then grabbed Susan's arms in her own and leaned forward, hissing something in ear.

"Thanks Hannah," Entwhistle continued.

Hefting a rat back and forth in his hands, he went on: "Okay, so there's 38 of us with our 'special knowledge'. To keep some semblance of order on things, raise your hand if you'd like to speak.

"You may only speak if you're holding the conch. I mean Scabbers," he said.

"I'll be the chairman for now. Draco, would you please act as our Sergeant at Arms?"

Mr. Malfoy's expression went from confused to profoundly anxious.

"Uh, what's that?" he asked, his piping voice failing to carry.

Crabbe, towering nearly half a foot over Malfoy, turned to answer: "basic parliamentary procedure. There's too many of us to talk all at once or it'd be chaos. Only people holding Petti... I mean the rat... get to talk. If anyone talks out of turn, you get to hex 'em. Preferably something that shuts them up good."

Pomona couldn't believe what she was hearing. By all accounts, the Crabbe family spawned an endless series of barely-literate thugs who'd be lucky to pass even one or two OWLS, and here the latest Crabbe boy was lecturing a Malfoy on principles of government!

"Okay, so first order of business is obviously the Horcruxes," Kevin declared. His statement was meaningless to Pomona, but based on the many grim nods around the room, it looked like most of these 'self-inserts' agreed.

Susan Bones objected. She opened her mouth and started a rant, but one of the little Lions merely turned to Mr. Malfoy, jerked his head towards Susan and gave him a predatory grin.

Draco seemed to finally shake himself out of his bewildered state. He drew his wand, a smile spreading across his face.

"Petrificus Totalus!"

"Serpensortia!"

His first hex collided squarely with Miss Bones's chest. As the girl started toppling backwards, a three-foot long brown adder emerged from Draco's wand.

"Goddammit, Draco!" one of the Ravenclaws exclaimed. "Quick, Harry, tell the snake to stop moving!"

Heads swiveled towards Mr. Potter.

"Uh... what?" he was even more confused than Pomona was, and clearly very uncomfortable with the sudden attention.

A Gryffindor girl that Pomona thought was named Lavender something turned to Harry and answered him, "Harry, you can talk to snakes, like at the zoo! Tell the snake to stop!"

Harry's mouth opened, a question on his lips.

"No time, Harry, the snake might bite someone!"

Mr. Entwhistle turned his attention on little Harry.

"Harry," his voice again carrying the calm authority of a person decades older, "we'll answer your questions later, but for now, please tell the snake to stop."

Severus interrupted the children's bickering by smoothly drawing his wand and dispelling the snake. Mr. Entwhistle merely nodded at the man in thanks.

Pomona had no idea what was going on, but the way these firsties were conducting themselves promised one thing: the next seven years would be something to remember.

--------------

Filius was fascinated.

Sure, he cultivated an appearance of excitable affability to put students at ease, but he wasn't the head of Ravenclaw for nothing. He was, first and last, an academic. Even his achievements on the dueling circuit were merely an extension of his studies into mobility charms.

He watched as a few dozen 11 year old students organized themselves, following something called "Robert's Rules of Order." They formed committees and even sub-committees. They bickered back and forth in a manner that was reminiscent of nothing so much as a contentious faculty meeting.

He caught snippets of conversations that seemed to make reference to other lives. If he could believe what he was hearing, many of these students claimed to be decades older, with a disproportionate number of them making references to places that were in the U.S.

Even that phrase - "self-insert" - was so very tantalizing. Self? Which self? A soul? A mind? And inserted into what? Into these 11 year old bodies? The implications for the original inhabitants was worrying in the extreme.

The discussions drew to close after no more than a half-hour. Mr. Entwhistle gathered together a bunch of muggle papers with the notes taken by each group of students. After running through them for a few minutes, he cleared his throat and looked like he was going to start speaking.

One of his Ravenclaws - a Mr. Goldstein - interrupted him. "Okay, I've had enough. Who the hell put you in charge, Entwhistle? Who are you that you get to speak for all of us?"

Mr. Entwhistle turned a withering gaze on the little Eagle. "I'm in charge because I am. I'm in charge because I was a successful VP-level executive at Unilever before all... all this happened.

"I'm in charge because I was the mother of five rambunctious children, each of whom could put the twins to shame. I'm in charge because I will stop at absolutely nothing to get my family back.

"I'm in charge because I. SAID. SO. NOW DOES ANYONE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT!?"

His voice cracked slightly at the end, but the effect was diminished not at all. Forty-three very intimidated pairs of eyes looked away, none daring to challenge Mister... Missus? Entwhistle's claim to leadership.

"Very well. Albus, let us begin. First, for the name and location of the horcrux located here in Hogwarts, we demand that you bring Horace Slughorn back as potions master..."

Filius couldn't help himself. He quickly pulled out a sheet of parchment and charmed a quill to take notes. He was one of the most accomplished charms masters in the world and yet he'd never even heard of a "horcrux." It was clearly a word to conjure with, a thing of dire power, given the expression on Albus's and Severus's faces each time Mr. Entwhistle made reference to them.

--------------

This was a gift. A gift that beggared all belief. A gift beyond imagining.

Albus watched as this entity wearing a boy's skin made demands of him. Demands that were somehow reasonable, somehow good. They asked for nothing for themselves, showing no greed. They asked for things that would improve the quality of Hogwart's education. Above all else, they asked for things that would help Harry.

The smallest flex of his authority had his heads of house remaining silent, holding their peace for now. Albus needed to focus all of his attention on this impossible phenomenon. This gift.

The universe was handing him the means to remedy the third and final of his great mistakes. He would join Ariana and Gellert some day, but he could not rest until Riddle was permanently defeated. Plans and contingencies were in place. Manipulations proceeded, some delicate, some blunt. Yet everything hung on a thread.

And here were 38 eleven year olds, stomping into his life, ripping the thread in half, and showing him that the abyss over which he hung was little more than a mummer's trick of black cloth and low lighting.

They made demands about Cuthbert, Horace, and Severus. They referenced Sirius Black and Harry's muggle relatives. One particularly loud group demanded that all students, including first years, be allowed to try out for Quidditch.

It was that last demand that sealed it for Albus. The sheer surreality of the scene could only be real. Only reality would so casually mix the mundane with the transcendent.

They made their demands, and Albus haggled simply to keep up appearances.

A mere two hours after the Sorting Ceremony of 1991, the negotiations wrapped up, and Albus broke into his first untroubled smile in nearly a century. He stood from his chair, clapped his hands once, and ushered in the future.

******* Well, I finished it and I don't know what to think. The scattered nature of the story is a major reason why I don't like stories written by people who make it up as they go along.

There's elements that get brought up and then dropped and then the story just kinda ended.

Like, what was the point of everything involving him and Fleur? Luna and Daphne are in a relationship...and? You'd think Luna being either gay or bisexual in this universe would be an interesting plot point. Perhaps her relationship with Daphne would be explored further. Daphne was deeply unhappy with being found out and desperately didn't want anyone to know about her relationship.

Oh, so is there homophobia in this version of the HP universe? Maybe Daphne is in one of those marriage contracts or something and that's why she needs to keep this a secret? But then he just swears on his soul and magic and walks off.

Why have Luna appear so much if she wasn't going to play a major role? She kept getting screen time but what did any of it lead to? What about Lucy for that matter? So he apparently seduced her once, but he has no memory of doing it. He doesn't ever regain his memories and then he ends up with Tonks. Why is Lucy here?

Well, the author didn't mind devoting chapters to a romance that never went anywhere or having characters show up and drop in and out of the story, because there was no plan. So in hindsight, a lot of this story was filler, but it could have been important as it was being written.

The heavy fanon elements grated on me but it turns out this is a complete AU, so I didn't mind it as much. Like the idea of wizards only living a hundred years and some change. Can I really feel sorry for Harry or Hermione or these other worthless idiots if they have a cure for death being offered to them and they refuse to take it?

I don't think I've ever seen a story where the main character having a limited "magical core" wasn't eventually worked around. I always hated it that some people can be blatantly born better than others, but it really just comes down to a way to make Harry, Dumbledore and Voldemort seem like total badasses.

I'm okay with wish fulfillment stories, but this one wasn't especially moving for me. So the guy has sex with loads of women but besides Tonks, the others get little development. He had a three way with the bar lady but then she just drops out of the story. He doesn't seem to care about any of them. I'm struggling to remember if he even told Tonks that he loves her at any point.

He has sex with Bellatrix, who is good apparently, but what's the point? He didn't immediately go and rescue Narcissa, nor did he take Bella with him when he went to go confront Voldemort. Why even have her be secretly good? She's only in this story to ride this dude's dick.

The main guy's personality wasn't especially gripping and he didn't seem to really stand for much of anything. He coasted along in life from one event to another. At least he was relatively smart, except when he needs to be stupid for dramatic effect or to push the plot along.

What even is his personality, anyways? He decided that after he defeated Voldemort and rendered him harmless, he'd kill every single Death Eater present...because? He showed the ability to stop time, and he could have taken them alive. Why's he a killer all of a sudden? He didn't go out of his way to murder anyone before this.

He had plenty of opportunities to kill Death Eaters and get away with it, but he chooses not to.

He just decides to kill all of these guys at that moment and claims he wasn't forged in the light. Okay...we gonna explore this element of his personality? No? Alright.

Same deal with the House elves. We don't see him actually change the Ministry or anything to give them rights or end abuse against them, he just buys a bunch of them and treats them fairly well. Despite having the ability to conjure infinite gold and he knows how corrupt the government is.

We see nothing about him changing the utterly monstrous marriage contracts that apparently warp people's personalities entirely and turn them into utterly horrific, sadistic monsters. No, he just fucks Bellatrix and then Narcissa is saved and then we see nothing else from this.

Why did Lucius get to live? Was it to spare Sirius the pain of breaking the contract? But apparently he's not truly evil, despite having handed the diary to Ginny and organized that little Death Eater raid during the world cup. And the fact that rather than go for freedom, he alerted Voldemort to the main character's presence so he and Tonks could be killed? What has he done to deserve to get off scot free?

Okay, author.

Again, why didn't they save Narcissa right away? Why even wait? Did Sirius not love this cousin as much as the other one?

We don't see anything about either of these women recovering from years of abuse and being trapped in their heads while their bodies went about doing awful shit. It could have been interesting to see how Narcissa treats Draco now. Does she even love him? He was conceived by rape after she was twisted into a completely different person. What does she think of him being a racist, bigoted little shit?

We'll never know. Wasted potential.

Loads of great ideas in this story, but terrible execution.

So much of this story was completely pointless and the author just threw in whatever ideas they thought were cool at the time.

Like that entire section with the new magical game. It's a hell of a lot better than Quidditch! It's pretty awesome! But totally irrelevant to the plot. You could cut out that entire section and nothing would change.

So I'd say before the reboot halfway through, the story was a 7/10.

Pretty kickass, the main character was on track to destroy Voldemort and his scientific mind was intriguing to read. Until he apparently killed himself somehow. The author decided that instead of ending the story and starting a new one with a similar premise, and even the same characters, to just redo it and keep going because he made the main character too powerful and wanted the story to follow the script of canon.

The second part is a 3/10.

At first it was implied he died going through a cabinet that's charmed to kill anything that enters it, but later it's stated that killing Voldemort too quickly causes the universe to implode. Somehow. It's not explained why this happens.

This doesn't lead to any sort of emotional conundrum with the main character acknowledging that many have to die to keep the "plot" on track who really shouldn't have. At the very least, Bertha and Barty Crouch Senior were killed and probably many others when the Death Eaters started to operate again.

The story takes a dive in quality until eventually the main character decides to just go kill Voldemort without telling anyone but Tonks, then nearly gets Tonks killed and then brings Harry over to kill Voldemort, and then it ends.

So it was certainly an interesting story, but it's a prime example of why you'd want to have some guidelines on where you're going and where you plan to end up.

I'm guessing the author reads a lot of HP fanfics and borrowed heavily from them for ideas for this one. Hence why there's so much stuff that doesn't serve any further purpose.
