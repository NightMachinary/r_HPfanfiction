Harry is never very dark in Dark fics

This is one my biggest bug-bears with the fandom.

Edgy as it may be, I like villainous characters, and I like a hero's fall to the dark even more.

Which is why Dark Harry Potter fics nearly always infuriate me. I understand that to some degree making characters sympathetic is important, and so I'm not saying that in stories where Harry is dark that he should be surrounded by gratuitously evil characters with no nuance to them.

HOWEVER, most Dark!Harry fics go way too far in the opposite direction and,strangely, seem to just make the genre redundant. Because they make it so that Dumbledore and Molly Weasley and the Order of the Fried Chicken are secretly unredeemingly evil, and on the other hand it turns out that actually, Voldy and the Malfoys and Bellatrix are warm-hearted sugarmuffins who rescue Harry from the abuses of the Durgles and Dumbledick, shower him with love and affection and don't seem to be flawed in any way. I mean, frankly the authors who write this stuff may as well just not write Dark!Harry whatsoever, because they've just made Harry being dark completely arbitrary. They may as well keep him on the light, which is funny in itself because I've read plenty of normal light Harry fics with more nuance and ambiguity of the characters than most Dark!Harry fics.

I really wish this would change. Imagine getting more Dark!Harry fics where instead of the light being evil, Harry is presented as a flawed person. Perhaps he's afraid and doesn't wish to fight Voldemort, or because of his upbringing harbours a deep hatred and disgust for muggles, perhaps Harry develops an addiction to dark magic, or perhaps for the most OOC fics, Harry is simply born lacking empathy, or hasn't developed it in the Dursley's home.

I appreciate that better Dark!Harry fics do exist, but they are few and far between. Most seem to written by angsty 14 year olds who want an excuse to ship Drarry or make Harry fall into a paedophilic union with Voldemort or Snape.

Edit:

In fact while I'm here, I'll think I'll shout out what I see as good examples of Dark Harry done right, where he's both human, as are his cohorts (even Voldemort, kinda) while still maintaining the humanity of the light.

First: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27859645/chapters/68210517]]

Hell, The Devil In Me still has some bashing of the light in it, but so far still keeps things relatively nuanced.

Second: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15558741/chapters/36119607]]

Third: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10267302/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Dark-s-Rise]]

Edit 2: I thought I'd made clear what I was arguing here, but clearly not. So to clarify: I am not arguing that Harry and his Dark fellows should be gratuitously, moustache-twirlingly evil. I am all for making them sympathetic characters. HOWEVER, the best way to do that, is not the lazy way, which is to make Dumbledore and the Order gratuitously evil, or to decide that oh actually, the Death Eaters aren't bigots with violent tendencies but wholesome and loving and that Harry is completely justified in all his behaviour. Fundamentally, what I'm arguing for is a dark Harry who is a genuinely flawed person, while also remaining sympathetic. That does not mean he'll cannibalise babies for the hell of it, but he may well do things the reader thinks are immoral.

*** Yh. I see a lot of those too. I mean, I'd not mind if from Harry and his cohort's perspectives the other houses were the real bullies, so long as the authors establish that things are not so black and white, but in reverse.

I think this stems from the very black and white world of cannon, where JK established that Slytherins are bad and Gruffindors are good.

But just flipping that completely doesn't actually improve anything. It's kind of like going: I want to help all the poor people in the world by taking all the money rich people have and leaving them poor (this isn't any political commentary btw, it just seems like an easy example)

I did a Draco and Colin Creevey fic where Draco loves Colin but in the end refuses to be with him claiming that as a pure blood it is improper to be with a muggle born and especially a male one......and will not shame himself before his family

Draco has nice traits and is actually fairly kind and in the sequel is a great husband and father to Astoria and Scorpius but is clearly still a bigot

I mean, maybe you have a harder heart than me, because I probably would have made Draco just give up on his beliefs, face rejection by his parents and be with Colin, but their relationship would be fraught because Draco is still going to hold the feeling that purer blood is better and that muggles (say Colin's parents for example) are lesser.

******** What's his motivation there then? To stay with Colin I mean. If he still truly believes that Colin's inferior to him then it can't be a relationship of equals, so how does Draco view their dynamic? Or does it involve him sorta trying to rationalise things away by maybe trying explain how generally purer blood leads to better magic and that sure Colin's parents are people too but they're just not really people he cares about or holds any respect for because he feels there's like an unavoidable divide between them? And then what's Colin's motivations for being with Draco?

I mean, people are really very good at mental gymnastics and so I think it's very possible that Draco could believe that Colin is a person whom he can love, while still thinking purebloods are better. Hell, he could even decide Colin was an exception to the norm of insufferable mudbloods.

Not that I'm criticising your plot btw, it sounds good also.

**** I think the big issue is too many people do not consider revenge as Dark.

In canon, Harry use the crucuato curse. You need to really want to hurt someone for it to work.

If in your world and by your own moral compass consider there is no valid reason for torture, then Harry does something pretty dark.

We still sympathize with Harry because we love McGonagall, and the jerk spit on her. But torturing someone is still morally very wrong, no matter what.

A good Dark Harry fanfiction should start from there. Or something like that. But slowly, his reasons are less understable and victims are less and less dark themselves.

And the line of "wrong for the right reason" and "wrong for the wrong reason" becomes less and less clear as more torture and killing are done.

Like killing in self-defense slowly become killing someone we know will commit a crime, than is likely to commit a crime then look like someone that might commit a crime someday etc etc.

this is my favourite harry-goes-dark fic. (it's a oneshot)

It doesn't have any character-bashing (no dumbledork was actually evil all along, or weasleys only cared about harry's money ,etc.)

This portrays harry as a bad person who kills loads of people, but also a bit sympathetic (?)

The series starts dark, grows progressively darker, then finally takes you to the soul crushing maw of the center of a black hole from which your ability to enjoy life for the next few weeks will never escape. It does not get better. There is no light at the end of the tunnel. There is only suffering. You have been warned.

** Have you tried Antithesis ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12021325/1/Antithesis]])

super dark and depressing, and the start is somewhat slow, but it is absolutely beautiful.

Not for the weak hearted, the protagonist goes through a lot of negative emotions in this and doesn‘t occupy the moral highground. Thus can be challenging to read.

It‘s the only dark!Harry fic I know where I actually consider him dark, and not merely edgy. Most of the others I‘ve read have him doing crazy fucked up magic (like baiting dumbledore into a fight, killing him and returning him from the dead enslaved with her crazy necromancy), but the protagonist still seems to win at the end and his moral standpoint isn‘t worse than those of his antagonists. Even if he imperiuses the queen, founds a sovereign magical state, and kills all muggles (although that was a grey!Harry fic I believe)

*** Writing a compelling evil character is difficult once you go past "Anakin Skywalker wiping out the tribe who kidnapped and tortured his mother" levels of evil. The list of people you can torture without being properly evil for example is rather short. The Dursleys, the Death Eaters, Umbridge and maybe Marietta (depending on how much you focus it as an anti-Voldemort group and not just a study group) and Lupin (if Harry takes the abandonment personal). As much as the Weasleys bore me, you cannot find a good reason to torture them. Same goes for most other background characters.

So as soon as Harry starts to randomly murder people, he stops being a compelling character. Especially since a lot of the valid targets are usually on Harry's side in those stories.

Then he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer.

** It think the problem is that the fandom has two definitions on what "dark" is. There is what you are looking for which is a moral aspect with dark being evil and there is the magic aspect, which is often not moral (or rather it is, but the authors remove the moral implications of necromancy and sacrifices of living beings). Most dark!Harry fics are just stories of him doing cool magic, but they keep his character as is, and as the other canon dark magic practitioners are all death eaters they now need to be nice.

** Harry is never very Dark in those fics because the term is usually Harry using more dark magic that what Dumblydore approves of. That's Dark!Harry. There are some fics that make Harry sadistic as shit and slap on the Dark! tag.

Dark Harry, for me, is someone who uses a lot of the Slytherin and Gryffindor techniques in the best/worst ways. He is self aware, he is cunning and ambitious, he is loyal to an agenda and is brave to the point that he can cross the lines of good and evil without going into a moral panic attack (see OoTP). Dark!Harry is not a total mirror of Tom Riddle, because he himself cannot have the exact same traits as Riddle, his environments are different etc.

I also think that many Dark!Harry fics allow Harry loads of friends, specifically in Slytherin. Even though most people who have been "dark" or "bad"in history, are charming but are usually in their lonesome. Harry should be a bit awkward, growing up without a strong social environment, he hasnt had many friends so he's cold but can turn up false charm to get things.

This may not seem like "dark" traits, but they're traits that can be utilised easily in dark circumstances - Harry is not a carbon copy of Riddle but he's not completely different to him either. I mean the boy has a part of Riddle's soul in him lol.

Just because he does bad things, and perhaps does them for a cause we as the reader don't agree with, or makes decisions he himself sees as immoral for a greater good, does not make him an unsympathetic character.

I'd suggest you take a look at the fics I've given as examples of what I see as a good Dark Harry, if you don't think it's possible to write Harry as sympathetic without flipping the moral axis of the universe on its head simply to justify all of Harry's decisions.

more directly relating to your discussion, I find that interesting stories rely on nuance which is why there's a temptation to turn the evil people into good people, disregarding the stories where the evil people are turned into good people for shipping reasons. Misplaced anger at *M*olly and *D*umbledore, on the other hand, seems more and more to me like redirected anger at *M*om and *D*ad.

** So, if you're interested in a dark Hermione, I just read what's available of Coven linkao3(15234645) and it's probably one of the better portrayals of a dark character. I think she has a slightly easier time finding additional allies than is realistic, but it's so clear that what she's doing is wrong, and that her friends who are worried about her (the villains in her perspective of the story) actually have some really good points. It's probably not to everyone's taste, and I was put off by the summary at first, but I was really pleasantly surprised.

** I always found the issue to stem from those authors focusing on Harry's actions rather than why he takes them. If someone eats babies for breakfast, and it's because he wants to break the substantial oppression against poor people, his actions don't logically follow. They want Harry to be dark, but they don't want him to be evil by conventional standards, they want him to follow their guidelines. If we're being honest, ascribing our main character immediate villain status isn't exactly conducive to engaging writing, because dark is supposed to be evil. Are we saying his actions are evil? Same rabbit hole. It's not very accurate if you want him to be the hero, fallen or otherwise. Also, you could make Harry both a death eater or a complete integrationist, and call him dark both ways, cause morality is subjective! To call him dark, you have to make him in the wrong somewhere. And so I petition for writing better descriptions. Also I'd like a story where Harry fights Voldemort because he thinks Tom's a hack, and he'd make a better dark lord.

However, I think it's more than possible to write a Harry who has views that the author disagrees with.

And well, I think ascribing him villain status is fine so long as he's not cackling madly from day 1.

And I'm confused by you saying it doesn't work for a fallen hero. If somebody was to write a Harry who gradually strays farther and farther from the hero he used to be, then he's going to change over time, but it doesn't mean you can't ascribe tags that tell the audience what kind of character he's going to become over time.

** THANK YOU!

Be it "Dark!Harry" or any other trope, making canonically good people into jerks/evil in order to justify Harry cutting them out of his life (or in order to create tension) is just lazy writing to me.

For example, wouldn't it be much more engaging if Ron and Harry were truly close friends, but their friendship was put under lot of tension because of their clashing values (or misguided choices, third part's manipulation, etc.)? If we saw their relationship deteriorating and both sides are helpless to stop it? Yum and sad at once!

Or if you wanted Harry to pull away from Dumbledore's influence? Instead of making Harry magically see through Dumbledore's "nefarious manipulations" (or Dumbledore being evil in the first place), how about Good Ole Dumbles means well but may be misguided in what he thinks is necessary? And Harry is able to acknowledge the old man's faults without hating the man (which in itself is completely out of Harry's character, but ofc he is allowed to be OOC), so he forges his own path in whatever your given Harry thinks he should do. Take it as Dark or Light as you wish. Or maybe Voldemort appeals to some inner darkness of Harry's and lures him into joining ranks. Harry knows he'd be betraying all his loved ones but for one reason or another believes Voldemort's side is the right one to be on. Make him second-guess everyone and everything around him and spiral from bad to worse, whether emotionally or morally.

(( Also happens often in the romance department; "Hey actually Ginny is a total gold digging cow, better date /insert character name/ instead!!" ))

I'm spitballing with the "examples" here ㅡ I'm not telling anyone my way is the highway. I simply think there's no tension and payoff in Harry's "fall" from the light if the "light" has no appeal in the first place.

You'll probably outgrow this when you realize that they don't make for very good or interesting stories (as sole protagonists). I always like to point to Breaking Bad when talking about this: The more evil Walter White became, the more antagonistic (instead of protagonist) they made him and the show focused on other characters, made you root against him. He's the bad guy, you can't be on his side.

If you think that a tragic fall to the Dark makes for an uninteresting protagonist, then you've clearly never read Macbeth, or at least would consider it boring.

What I mean, is a Harry with a fundamentally different view on the world than cannon Harry, that leads him to do some immoral things, that only get worse over time. You might call that fundamentally evil, but I'd not.

And I don't think most Dark Harry fics provide this, because they just completely justify all of Harry's decisions.

Surely you see that there's a difference between a Harry who is fundamentally evil and a Harry who makes decisions that we may view as immoral, or that Harry himself may view as immoral, but see as necessary and become desensitised too?

Oh don't get your knickers in a twist.

If you are truly looking for stories with mature themes you're not going to find them by authors who label their stories with "Dark!Harry", because they are either edgy/immature themselves or advertise their stories to such an audience. Meanwhile you are surprised that those stories don't turn out as you want them and make a huge reddit rant about it and also have the gall to be upset when someone tells you "gee, why are you surprised?!". Really?

FYI: Shakespeare didn't call his plays "Dark!MacBeth".

They could, but a label like Dark!Harry is inherently useless for what you just described to me (a story with a hero's fall from grace, etc.). Do you think "Dark!Boromir" would be applicable or that a serious author would describe their characters in such terms? I don't think anyone who writes with such subtelty would use a one dimensional label for a character that has many (interesting) layers.

I stand by what I said. There's good reason why stories with this label either have the problem that you described (it's merely using 'dark' symbolism, while in actuality it's just a role-reversal) or are just awful "Grr i'm so evil" edgy powerwank fantasies. The Dark!Harry label is good for people who are looking for one of those two types of stories, nothing else.

My advise would be to just read regular gen fics, that don't put Harry into one particular corner, and you'll probably be more likely to find something you'd enjoy. You're making it hard for yourself.

Edit: I'd probably say something similar to someone who's unhappy about the fics they find under the indie!Harry tag. These kind of tags represent a type of hp fanfiction sub-genre and most independent!Harry fics have very little in common with what I'd consider reasonable for a Harry who wants to be independent (in HP fanfiction land it's always lone-wolf Harry who antagonizes everyone and knows best; pretty much a recipe for disaster).
