Just read the first chapter of a new story that brought up a very interesting point. Is delphini really Voldemort's daughter, when the body that he used, was born of Harry's blood. Thoughts

** Well, that would make her the daughter of Tom Riddle Sr (bone), Harry Potter (blood) and Peter Pettigrew (flesh).

And now the horrible thought of a Mama Mia musical where Delphini is looking for her real dad came into my mind.

** Yeah, I read that till Ginny got lots of money for cheating on Harry and stopped.

I can't stand "I will be nice and forgive people for absolutely everything" Harry Potter.

*** I too hate this trope. I vastly prefer a gray to dark leaning harry. Not that I prefer evil harry, but I prefer a harry that's has no qualms about getting into the dirt to fight back.

You can't end a war with fuckin expelliarmus and stupefy ..

**** I don't really think using lethal curses is "Dark", I always find that weird in fanfics. Yes, police officers capturing criminals should use Disarming and Stunning curses. Terrorists who are basically enemy soldiers? You don't fight back with stun guns and batons, you shoot them.

As for me, I just think there's a difference between being forgiving and being so forgiving you're a doormat.

** It's a bit more complicated than that, I think.

There has always been a bit of an odd relationship between magic and blood/genes and the soul in Harry Potter -- JKR says magic is given via a gene, which explains squibs and muggleborns, but we've also seen magic that's both hereditary yet also linked to one's soul.

Parseltongue, for example, is hereditary aka genetics, but we also know that the soul is involved somehow because of Harry being able to speak it due to the fragment of Voldemort's soul in his scar.

When Voldemort attained a new body, he could still speak parseltongue, meaning that it's linked to the soul and from his maternal ancestry (genes).

A metamorphmagus like Tonks? It popped up in her (genetics) and she passed it down to her son, Teddy.

IIRC there was a relationship between the soul and a patronus (involving something deep rooted in the psyche/soul) and an animgus form, IIRC. Having the ability to become an animagus may only be possible for some people (James and Sirius were from pureblood backgrounds, but we don't know about Peter).

Amusingly enough, the fanon take on blood purity that (primarily) antagonists proscribe to may have some basis in truth, if certain traits, like metamorphmagi, come from primarily pureblood families because of genetic pooling, and they noticed that keeping children between families had these traits popping up more often.

So, why marry someone outside this group that'd limit the chances of something useful popping up?

Anyway:

Biologically, Voldemort's new body came from his father (bone), which isn't that squicky, Harry's blood, and Pettigrew's flesh: that means that, in his last body, Harry, Wormtail, and Tom Riddle Sr. were Voldemort's fathers.

The soul occupying the body, however, was Voldemort himself, so she is /his/ daughter.

So, you have a guy with three fathers banging Bellatrix, which resulted in Delphini.

That means technically Harry is her /grandfather/, at least by flesh/blood. Well, one of them, at any rate.

Man, that makes for a confusing family tree -- especially if he adopts her while she's young and still has his family with Ginny (not to mention Teddy being her second cousin).
