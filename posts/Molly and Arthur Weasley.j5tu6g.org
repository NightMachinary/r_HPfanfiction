Hello, I'd really like to get the chance to read something about Molly and Arthur being in romantic relationships with other people besides each other. Preferably this would have as much of the normal children and other settings in it as possible, but if it's good enough I am willing to overlook the absence of that.

I am asking for this because I think they would both be happy with others, especially Arthur being with a Half-Blood, Muggle-born, Squib, or Muggle woman.

If this involves them being with others after having once been together, such as a divorce, that's great. But not necessary!

Thank you very much! Sorry if this appears weird.
