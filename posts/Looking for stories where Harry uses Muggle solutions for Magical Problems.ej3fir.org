And it actually works! People wonder how Harry does everything, he can say or leave it a mystery.

It can be a parody, or played straight. It can be a drabble/oneshot or multichapter.

Would rather have no character bashing, especially no Weasley bashing, if possible.

It can be on any site, fanfiction.net or any other site.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash


** I'm going that way with a WIP where at Harry vs Quirrell relies on a bit more than "and then implausible magic happens that saves him."

It's not up yet, but if you want, I'll message the section to you.

*** I couldn't get into it unfortunately, the story felt too pretentious/stuck up for my taste.

I can understand why some enjoyed it, but I just couldn't.
