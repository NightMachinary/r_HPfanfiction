I can't remember the name of it, but the basic plot was that Voldemort got stuck in Harry's body when he tried to kill Harry. Instead of being evil, Voldy decides to bide his time and recruit minions! I remember specific things like Voldemort "realizing" that Lockhart was actually an incredible wizard, and concluding that Hermione was the darkest witch of her time. There's a lot of humor, and it's completely ridiculous haha.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.
