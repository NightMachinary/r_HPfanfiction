Everything in-story happens as a result of a character not existing in this version of events, and little to no additions except where that wasn't addressed in canon. Fanon is also a no-no.


** Well here is an interesting question:

Lucius Malfoy planted the diary on Ginny in part for revenge against Arthur and the new muggle protect law. If Harry isn't there first year, and Hermione is injured or killed by the troll: Would Lucius, as a member of the board be able to tie her hate to Ron's treatment of her and use that to drag down Arthur's standing enough politically to kill the bill?

​

Pointing out that his own child is cruel and abusive to muggleborns and had to have learned it somewhere...

Thus with the bill dead then Lucius has no cause to plant the diary and thus the Chamber incident is averted. However now you have Dumbledore never getting the Horocrux, so does this delay his ability to start tracking things down/doing research. What happens when Voldemort returns, noting that he won't have encountered Harry in 1991/1992, but

perhaps dragged Neville to the mirror when it stumped him?

What happens with Sirius, do the Wesley's still win the lottery and if they do, do they still take a trip to Egypt to see Bill?

​

So Harry being gone is a big game changer

What if Neville died when his parents were attacked?

​

Well first off, Hermione never goes searching the train for Trevor in his aid. What does this mean for her? Who does she wind up sitting with. It is kinda brave to put yourself out there to help a total stranger search for a less than stellar pet. Does she still wind up in Gryffindor or does she take the safer path?

Next the flying lesson. Without Neville there there is no fight over his Rememball. Harry probably doesn't wind up on the quidditch team.

They don't see Neville taunted and hexed in the halls, though it is possible someone else will take his place as a Slytherin, Draco Malfoy, target for harrassment.

Neville doesn't sneak out to stop them from getting in trouble/help with the Dragon/stand up to them in the Dorm room.

​

No Snape Boggart, no providing Sirius Passwords no accident

No Neville to provide Gillyweed. No taking Ginny to the Yule Ball, no seeing his reaction to the Unforgivables

​

No Neville standing up to Seamus in the common room

No Neville at the DA or DOM. No fighting, alongside Luna, the DEs that invade at the end of sixth year no Neville to lead the resistance in 1997/1998 at Hogwarts, no Neville to slay the final Horocrux

​

Taken from the start, there are a lot of butterfly's to work with once you have a divergence point. Simply written the character is just replaced by someone else or things are a bit more difficult to reach the same conclusion.

​

Done seriously, it will be hard to stay cannon because of how much it will change the events that shape the characters. We don't see everyday of there lives, just the important moments in the books. For the most part, removing a character will change something and over time that change will build and build until it leaves cannon as a result. Additionally each person will interpert a characters motivations and knowledge differently, compounded by the fact that Harry is not a reliable narrator. He is an outsider, with little context or understanding of the world outside what he sees and experiences.

I've always wondered if Lucius knew the diary would somehow open the Chamber of Secrets, or if he just thought it was some random Dark Object that once belonged to Voldemort.

#+end_quote

I think Hermione would still end up in Gryffindor, because (iirc) she asked the Sorting Hat to place her there, partly because it was the House of Albus Dumbledore.

  No Neville to provide Gillyweed.

That was only in the movie, in the book it was Dobby that gave Harry the Gillyweed.

*** Without Harry, Voldemort would've still failed to get the stone, right? In that case (assuming your lack of diary idea holds), Wormtail has no reason to try and seek out Voldemort and bring him back to life.

It's generally a bad idea to keep the events mirroring canon if there's a divergence point. Especially if you're not following a different perspective other than the core protagonists.

** WIth a little bit of imagination, many of the Neville is the Boy Who Lived stories can be read as an example where the missing character is Harry.
