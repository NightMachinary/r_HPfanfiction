I've read a few enjoyable ones like linkffn(5871255) and The Trinity series on Beast's Lair and am currently casually reading through linkffn(9586702) (though this one is a bit too overpowered Harry for my tastes). Would love to see what other stories anyone could suggest.


** I wonder if there's a fanfic where Harry, Ron and Hermione are the servants?

  The dictionary defined fiction as thus: something feigned, invented, or imagined; a made-up story. The act of feigning, inventing, or imagining. Yes, Harry thought, this defined him nicely. Harry Potter & Fate/Stay Night Crossover.

  When Zelretch conducts an experiment and the being known to all as Fate intervenes Harry Potter's life is changed irrevocably. Now being raised by those who don't fit the definition of 'Normal' it is a very different Harry that is unleashed on the world. Or is it worlds? Disclaimer: This is fan fiction, I only own the plot.

** Oh, I can help you there. Here are my all time favourites for you: linkffn(Harry Potter and Type Moon) is the absolute best in this category IMO, though linkffn(FateProphecy Break) comes pretty damn close. An it's killing me that each of them will probably never get the ending they deserve.

  A young Harry Potter gets his hands on a certain summoning ritual, and carries it out on the spur of the moment! Archer-Harry team. Independent, smart Harry.

  Harry Potter discovered a certain Visual Novel series in his youth, so became a bit too prepared for a world of Monsters and Magic. With the Church on the move, Vampires actually doing something, more Dark Lords than you can shake a stick at and a much bleaker future to look forwards to... truly the world needed a Hero, and it might just find one.

** Definitely linkffn(Matou Shinji and the Philosopher's Stone). The author merges both worlds really well, and adds his own interesting ideas. It's also really unpredictable , as the progress of rhe story is decided by readers' choices.

  Ladies of Eternity, magi of the past hiding in the present. Those words describe Witches in the Moonlit world, with their daughters inheriting their role without exceptions. But this is a story of a Witch's son -- a boy tossed aside by cruel fate. A boy who dreamed of becoming a magus, but failed. A boy, who carves his path through blood and wand. A Boy, a Potter, and a Thief.

  "You should think of this as an opportunity to learn about a completely different method of applied thaumaturgy," Zelretch explained. He then sighed and lamented, "For shame, to be cursed with such an ungrateful apprentice..."
