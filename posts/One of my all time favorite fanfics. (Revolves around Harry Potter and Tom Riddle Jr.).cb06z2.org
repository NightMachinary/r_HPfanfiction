Fate's Favourite and its prequel Past's Player by The Fictionist at fanfiction.net are two of the hp fics I never get tired of. Not really slash but could be if you kinda squint. The author's other works too are really great!!!! Most of them centers around Harry Potter and Tom Riddle Jr. Some are slash, some aren't.

My favourite, "Fate's Favourite" has around 150 chapters and I've read it way over 15 times for the past 3 years. Won't spoil it for you. Give the fic a chance!! One of the best fics out there (and I've read a lot)

Author's summary of Fate's Favourite: "You always get the stories where Harry goes back into Tom Riddle's time, then either stays or gets sent back. End of, unless he tries to make Voldemort good. But what if things went differently? What if, just once, someone followed a time traveller back?"

Basically, Tom Riddle Jr. travels to the future (with some of his 'friends') to follow Harry Potter back (who accidentally travelled to the past -- see Past's Player). Tom is still dark but not necessarily evil. Harry considers Tom as a friend. Reading them banter, bicker, fight and talk through the story is really amusing and interesting. One of my favorite lines in the fic is "The only person who can make me think that being Tom is worth more than being Voldemort is you" Not outright slash, just a platatonic, intimate and complex friendship between them.
