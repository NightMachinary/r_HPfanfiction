I hate Daphne fics so much but today I was bored at work and thought it would be interesting to read her as a Pure-blood Extremist and as an enforcer of it. I could see her tattling on Hogwarts students to the Carrow's. Like she's that rich girl who doesn't care about bigotry, but has an aneurysm over a lapse in decorum (unless the lapse in decorum is killing or torturing muggleborns. Make her creepy and weird. Slytherin is basically Hitler's Youth , I'd like some characters to actually be awful not "i'M gReY nOt DaRk! PuReBloOd NoT bIgOt.
