Could you recommend me some nice rarely recommended FF? I don't give many restrictions: - More than 25 chapters - No crossover


** I recommend this a lot, but I wouldn't say its recommended often on this sub. linkffn(Eclipse of the Sky)

Its my favourite fic, together with Grow Young with Me, a fleshed out OC, not a MarySue, massive worldbuilding, a bigger and grimmer (does this word even exist?) war, a tired, actual good and fairly manipulative Dumbledore, extremely paranoid Harry, great trio friendship (Ron is awesome), Tonks and Remus are hilarious with each other (mostly Tonks, she's crazy as fuck), new og creatures, really few cliches and a dry humour which I love. The romance is also a big factor for me. Oh, and if you think Horcruxes in canon were too easy? Don't worry, this is DEFINITELY not a canon compliant on that aspect.

Edit: Forgot to mention, the author is also really really cool. And she has a rabbit who eats her hair when she's asleep. So its only bonus points there.

  Horcuxes were the pits. Dark Lords with prejudicial god complexes were worse. Ones that abducted and experimented on every magical variant they could get their hands on to 'enhance' power were enough to make Harry outright murderous. It didn't help that his girlfriend was a variant, and Harry really wanted to hang on to the only girl crazy enough to snog him. Dark Harry/OC

** I don't remember if I have seen this one recommended here since I've read it for the first time years ago, maybe it was more popular in the past.

It's a Harry / OC , the OC is a muggle girl. I hope you'll like it, It's one that I loved back then and I have revisited a couple of times too.

  What if, when Petunia Dursley found a little boy on her front doorstep, she took him in? Not into the cupboard under the stairs, not into a twisted childhood of tarnished worth and neglect---what if she took him in?Petunia was jealous, selfish and vicious. We will not pretend she wasn't. She looked at that boy on her doorstep and thought about her Dudders, barely a month older than this boy. She looked at his eyes and her stomach turned over and over. (Severus Snape saved Harry's life for his eyes. Let's have Petunia save it despite them).Let's tell a story where Petunia Dursley found a baby boy on her doorstep and hated his eyes---she hated them. She took him in and fed him and changed him and got him his shots, and she hated his eyes up until the day she looked at the boy and saw her nephew, not her sister's shadow. When Harry was two and Vernon Dursley bought Dudley a toy car and Harry a fast food meal with a toy with parts he could choke on Petunia packed her things and got a divorce.

** Lost Connections is a good one. It's not recommended often and it does have a lot of grammar flaws, but English is the writers second language. They still do a good job and it's a Muggle OC so they get points for being brave in that exploration.

Throwing in on Eclipse of the Sky and I agree it is great. Did not know the writer has a rabbit, but agree on them being one of the few who isn't big headed and can take criticism. They're a first responder so that makes them really cool in my world and explains the sick and twisted lengths they go to with graphic injury details. If you want realism and carnage everywhere go there.

Grow Young With Me is a good one also. My biggest complaint there is the tortoise paced update speed for short chapters. There are 25 or 26 chapters right now so you may want to wait like a year or 10 at their current pace to just read it when they are done. I don't have a lot of confidence it will be finished but what they have is good.
