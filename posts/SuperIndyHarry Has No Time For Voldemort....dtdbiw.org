Trained from childhood by the most skilled wizards ever born, blessed with power from birth and esoteric ritual, given fortune and influence from the bloodlines he hails from: Harry Potter is the most powerful wizard alive, a peerless being that even Dumbledore respects.

So of course the "threat" of Voldemort is a non-issue. And Tom does not believe it until he calls out Dumbledore's precious Boy Who Lived for one last duel...

...and he doesn't show up.

Of course he leaves a note, a beautiful snow white owl drops a roll of parchment at his feet,

"I'm in Jordan, trying to figure out who this Judas guy is. I'll deal with you when I get back."

Turns out, Harry has set his sights much higher than his little insurrection...

There are whispers of a mind-controlling being claiming to be 'the Killer of Christ' all throughout the middle-east. The entirety of Libya is under his spell...

The disappearance of the region of Wallachia after the sudden resurgence of the long extinct Nosferatu. They claim their King has returned...

And a demon calling itself Satanael claims its dark god has decreed it time for mankinds ruin. Harry and his team desperately hunting for any hint on the being 'Yaldabaoth'...

"I don't have time for you right now, Tom."

Cue Voldemort deciding he'll tackle those problems himself. Not because he's suddenly some humanitarian, but he is the Darkest wizard of all time and just as much of a theat to the world as any of them.

And that brat Potter will treat me as such! No, Lucius! I am not jealous! ...baka
