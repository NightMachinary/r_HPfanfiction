Contrary to popular fanon, I believe that James and Lily were excellent and loving parents to Harry and would have continued to be if they lived. (I get why the opposite is so often shown in fics, it makes for drama and conflict, etc., but I don't like that now it's assumed Lily and especially James were bad people)

I would like to see fics with baby Harry and James and Lily doting on their baby son and just fluffy, happy, sweet stuff. I don't mind if it's canon so, you know, we know it ends tragically, but I'd prefer happy fic to wistful, poignant 'soon they will die' fics. Also everyone-lives, everything's-fine AUs are much appreciated.


** Omg I'm with you, I feel like James and Lily are written to be horrible, neglectful patents to Harry in almost every fic where they live (and they're practically always WBWL). I mean, they loved him enough to give their lives for him without a thought, I really can't see them in the way they're so popularly portrayed.

Sadly I don't know any fics where there's just domestic Potter family fluff :( But I like how this fic subverts the WBWL trope: linkao3(1115311)

It's fanon. If you remember canon and the part with the Mirror of Erised, you can get a short insight into how JKR portrayed James and Lily.

There's also the part in PoA where Harry can hear the final moments of James and Lily's lives. Of course, it's validation for what you said earlier, and they'd never have given up their lives so willingly had they been horrible neglectful parents.

Let's also not forget the part from GoF (I think? It's been such a long time since I've read canon) where Lily and James are proud and supportive of Harry.

Then there's also that bit in DH towards the end when Harry turns the Resurrection Stone and sees James, Lily, Sirius and Remus.

Canon is full of examples of how James and Lily were loving parents, but it's become fanon that they're horrible parents which seems to be a major part of the wrong BWL trope and independent!Harry or Slytherin!Harry tropes.

And I'm just remembering, but in the first book, McGonagall, Hagrid, Dumbledore, Flitwick, The Fat Lady (I think? I'm not sure on this one) and even Slughorn in book 6 all mention bits and bobs of James and Lilys personalities. It most definitely goes against the trope of them being horrible parents IMO

*** I mean, I didn't mind the first few WBWL fics, because that IS an interesting premise, but now it's been beaten to death. But honestly, from what we saw, James and Lily were amazing parents and them suddenly being seduced by fame is....a bit odd, since they weren't exactly no-names to begin with and they were still good, decent people.

***** Yeah, I agree. I mean, I guess it makes sense because there couldn't be a WBWL who is shunted aside for his twin brother if the parents are any good, but still.

Actually, that reminds me of something else I'd like to see, WBWL fics where Harry's brother loves him and is not a gigantic prat. I think I read one recently where Harry's parents are still dead and Harry's not treated very well by most other people (he's Slytherin) but his twin brother loves him very much and Harry loves him too.

** The only fix like this that I can think of is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][The Prince of Slytherin]] . Lily and James are not bad people in this, and neither is Harry's wbwl twin. But Lily and James are more mixed about the quality of their parenting. It's very long and the author does tend to make things extremely complicated and there are a lot of add-one and OoCM but it's not bad in the end.
