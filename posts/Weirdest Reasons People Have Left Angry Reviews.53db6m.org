I'm curious what are everyone's weirdest experiences with angry reviewers. For me, it's probably a tie between the one who flew into a rage and threatened to stop reading if we so much as mentioned a character's name again, and the one who stopped reading apparently because we portrayed Hermione in a positive light. Though he was much more vulgar in his wording.

*** I mean, I don't like it when authors say Daphne Greengrass had anything other than blonde hair, but I just ignore that part and keep my own mental picture of her instead of getting angry about it.

I can't recall Yaxley's hair ever being mentioned, but either way that's a ridiculous thing to get upset with.

**** I'm going to try to empathize with someone being irrational, but:

Rich people in Britain have houses that almost always follow a certain set of architectural conventions, and there's a lot of canon implication that Grimmauld place would fit those conventions: in other words, it's floorplan should be pretty close to any other seventeenth-century gentry townhouse.

Such a house would have a large, fancy dining room, complete with a large, fancy table surrounded by a dozen or more large, fancy chairs.

Such a house would also have a large, dreary kitchen (kitchens are not places nobility/upper class people go) - one more than large enough to fit an equally large table where a dozen people could sit and eat.

Here's where I have a hard time following the logic or the mentioned reviewer: while /proper/ upper-class pureblood wizards would always eat in the dining room and never go in the kitchen, Sirius was never a /proper/ upper-class pureblood wizard. And IIRC, they never really finished cleaning the dining room anyways.

***** Yes, I feel that the House a Grimmauld Place was intended (by Rowling) to be envisaged as a big town house, though her grasp of vernacular architecture is as sketchy as her maths. It wouldn't matter what the 'class' of the occupants was, so much as how rich they were and in any case Rowling is rather vague about how closely the 'Sacred 28' relates to or mirrors British aristocracy. Not that much from what I can see. In any case, Islington wasn't developed until the early 19th century so assuming the house was always hidden among Muggle houses, (my headcanon again) it can't have been built until 1830 or so at the earliest.

It is my favourite thing ever in HP. I have spent a ridiculous and unhealthy amount of time thinking and writing about this place.

That's a lovely sentence, btw.

And part of the reason I almost never care how these details are handled in fanfiction. Changes for the sake of changing things is bad - you lose the advantage of fanfiction on the first place - but there will be changes no matter what. There's a certain amount of Death of the Author that's inherent to fanfiction - you're going to change /something/ - it's really just a matter of making sure that divergence from canon is internally consistent.

Well, that and not dwelling on details that don't affect the plot, but that's a writing-guideline, not a fanfic one.

In most instances I've seen, the writer actually includes huge passages of the books in their text and it's terribly boring (also gets the fics pulled down for violating TOS) and probably fails to actually change anything as a result of reading them (though I've never actually read that far so who knows). Presumably in a /good/ type of this fic, we only see the characters reactions to what they read AND they change things as a result of having foreknowledge.
