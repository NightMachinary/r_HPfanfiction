I've been on a binge read of fics where harry's life isn't as it seems where dumbledore hides a lot from him and his identity and especially family/power-wise and is the actual bad guy and Voldemort's image was greatly manipulated and I just wanted to go this route but don't know how to search for this trope or even to begin, help pls

** /Let's Try Again/, by Daydreamer315 has James and Severus as Harry's parents, and Lily as the usurper in league with manipulative Dumbledore. Voldemort is still an enemy, though.
