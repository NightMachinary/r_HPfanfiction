I'm looking for marauder era books or fics with Dark Marauders (not evil them just being on Voldemort side against Dumbledore) Slytherin Harry would be cool too. As well as any books were James and Lily survived or one of them did. I can't find any books on the Marauders and it's driving me mad. I don't mind slash books so James/Sirius or whoever is cool as well as James/Lily so there's that. I definitely prefer completed books but it's Okay if they're not. I don't mind AO3 or Fanfiction. I prefer AO3 but it's cool if it's not. Thanks!

  The Maruaders were not nice people, but what if the gang was as Dark as they should at first glance appear to be? AU Marauders era one-shot.
