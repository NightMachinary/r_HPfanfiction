** Once saw one where Harry was an Ilvermony student, it was honestly horrible, for some odd reason, Harry was just all talk and no action while making empty threats towards people. Then there was this odd, what the author called 'emotional chapter' that was terribly executed and did nothing for the story, Harry was a massive cuck, didn't do much, and there was wayyyy too much force on the whole 'Bisexual and Lesbian' type deal for side characters who don't even matter.

**** It seemed like it was pretty much just an obligatory Ilvermorny fic because it was exactly the sort of junk people would expect when you get a new topic. Take a whole bunch of already overused ideas, and stuff them all together with the new setting. Pretty much just marking off boxes on a checklist.

***** It was the whole concept of these teens being seemingly more mature than the adults in their lives, without actually being more mature. Then you throw in the inescapable marriage contracts, bisexuals/lesbians with their tragic backstory, a harem developing, two 14 year olds deciding on a "6 month plan" with a betrothal after knowing each other for a few days at the most, the 11 year old little sister already being completely sure of her sexual identity, and finish it off with extremely drawn out political games. I managed to get to chapter 40 something before I had to quit.

****** And what about that, 'greater good Dumbledore'? I doubt a Dumbledore on the light side would allow Neville Longbottom to just die after finding out that the prophecy was wrong about him. Also, what is with the whole 'invisibility cloak fiasco?', 'technically since Neville was somehow your godson you have the obligation to help him and he has the obligation to get a POTTER family heirloom', like WAT? Wouldn't a Potter family heirloom go into the Potter vault? Especially if the Goblins knew they were alive! Did Dumbledore just confundus every Goblin that attempted to talk to him? There was just too much 'moral obligation' for a story where Harry's main worry was supposed to be on completing the three tasks, don't understand how you get into wampus if you aren't actually a warrior...

******* I have no clue. I liked the idea behind the story, but it wasn't handled very well, and characters saying they aren't acting like assholes doesn't actually mean they aren't being assholes. The excuse that Harry needed to make some show of force and "draw the line in the sand", as it were, doesn't suddenly make him not a jerk.

***** Man I think I made it maaaaaybe 5 chapters and just moped the fuck out. It was around the time his sister realized she was a lesbian and I was just like 'thaaaaats believable.' I just hate fics where Harry is smug and his smile makes girls panties drop and that's the vibe I was getting from the story.

** The problem is that everyone in it would be OC (or very close to it). Once /Magical Beasts/ comes out in November we'll probably start seeing a few.

** Slightly off-topic: maybe it's the font I'm using in my browser, but I'm a bit confused. Is it spelled Eye-eye-vermorny or Eye-ell-vermorny?

*** I-LL-VUR-MOONY Ilvermony, its usually spelled with a capital I, so in some fonts it may look like two I's or two L's.

***** woops, forgot the R, so I suppose it would be Ill-Vur-Morny, I like the way I thought of it better however, the capital I thing still applies however.
