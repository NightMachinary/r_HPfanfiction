It would be nice to see how Hogwarts operated that year and what new character dynamics came about when Harry and Ron didn't come back. Most 'year after DH' stories I've seen focus on Harry and Ron or the Weasleys.

*** I'm really enjoying this. So happy to see Lavender back as well, she's a character that's really grown on me from fanon set post-DH.

**** Glad you enjoyed it! I have a lot of feelings about post-DH Lavender, the strongest of which, obviously, is that she did not die.

** Do you want the fic to be canon-compliant? A lot of 8th year fics have Draco/Hermione pairings.

*** Yeah they went straight into being Aurors. Ron left after two years to help Fred with the joke shop.

***** My headcanon is that that is the amount of time it took to round up the last of the Death Eaters, then Ron decided it was time to move on. Or perhaps he noticed that George was struggling alone.

****** I think that's perfectly reasonable.

The first time Voldemort fell, his Death Eaters were quickly to abandon him. With so many of them slaughtered at Battle of Hogwarts, things should be a lot easier this time around. Malfoy's defection certainly helped a lot, too.

****** Yeah, I think Ron decided to stick around the aurors just to round up the remaining death eaters. He was probably working the joke shop simultaneously. Saw a lot of potential in the shop and knew George was struggling.
