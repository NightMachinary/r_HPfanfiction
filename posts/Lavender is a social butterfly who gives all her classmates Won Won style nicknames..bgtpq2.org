"I'm going to have to kiss my sanity goodbye if you call me that again. What did you do now?"

"He seemed miserable, so I tried to be cute and called him Ha-Ha. I think he took it as me laughing at him."

** "Good morning Professor Sneaky-Poo!" Lavender greeted Snape in her typical manner.

"It's Professor Snape you imbecile..." Snape said in a long suffering sigh.

The Gryffindors in the class tittered.

"Five points from Gryffindor."

"See, I told you he is biased," Ron was whispering to Hermione. They thought that he couldn't hear them, but Snape really could.

"Mr Weasley, I'll take five more points from Gryffindor just to prove you right."

"See, I bloody told you!"

Hermione silenced his lips and stuck his hands together for good measure. Snape almost gave her points. Almost. She was a Gryffindor after all.

"Today we'll be learning the Fetus Deletus potion. The instructions are on your textbooks, begin."

"Pass on the toad legs, park-in-the-sun."

"My name is Parkinson, you more-Ron."

Ron's cheeks coloured. A sharp elbow from Hermione stopped him from toppling the table.

"Silence!" Snape shouted, and all of them went back to looking like they knew what they were doing. Spoiler, they didn't.

"I don't think that potion should be belching out rainbows, Neville. Are you sure about this?" Harry asked him.

"I think so."

His flask exploded.

"Damnit."

"Ten points from Gryffindor, Longbottom. Go see Madam Pomfrey."

Ron managed to mumble something before Hermione quickly reapplied the silencing charm.

"Yeah, Madam fishy-fishy will fix you right up, Longest-bottom!"

Parvati facepalmed herself. Why did she have to be friends with her? But then she remembered what Lavender could do with her tongue. Oh she knew exactly why she was friends with her.

Snape fired a Ventus, frustrated beyond words. He couldn't wait till the day these morons graduated away from him. No other batch had quite so many dunderheads.

45 minutes.

He had to wait for more 45 bloody minutes.

He was almost tempted to screw it all and join the Dark Lord. At least he would be tortured in a more traditional way. He felt he would gladly take a crucio to the face if it meant that he would be able to slaughter them all.

"You can ask for help from Professor Kitty-Cat, Professor Sneaky-Poo. She is always so helpful whenever I have a problem and I talk to her about it."

He looked at Harry, hoping that bastard would kill him.

"Good my intern, I've trained you well," said Luna, watching the drama from far away.

*** Oh God...this brought back some long forgotten memories...

At one middle school, where we were the new kids after a cross-country move, my twin brother and I got christened "Red Dude" and "Blue Dude," due to the colors of our fleece sweaters.

At another middle school, where we were the new kids after a cross-state move, I eventually got the nickname "Mr. Encyclopedia."

** Not my best work, guys. But, hey, I had fun

--------------

"Oh Shay-Shay!"

Seamus Finnigan cursed his name, his mother for giving his name, his great-great-great uncle and namesake for not changing the bloody name, the Ministry for deciding to bring back the damned Triwizard in the first place and the bleeding Yule Ball and his own fool luck.

Lavender Brown ran up to him, her cheeks redder than poinsettias. "There you are, Shay-Shay! I have so many things to talk about."

Seamus took a moment to curse himself for being too busy cursing everything to remember to run.

It wasn't that Lavender was /bad/ exactly. She was pretty and dotted on small animals and her perfume smelled nice. And she was extremely outgoing...perhaps too outgoing.

"A club for what was it?"

"We need to start a club for people whose names mean things in nature!"

"Uhhh...."

"Don't you see, Shay-Shay? Think of all the wonderful names in nature there are!"

"Uh...shouldn't you talk to Dean about this? His name means /valley./"

Lavender beamed so widely, Seamus wondered how her face didn't split in two.

"Great idea, Shay-Shay."

--------------

"Dee-dee!"

Dean was faster than Seamus and didn't hesitate in running, leaving behind Ginny who was trying to finish an essay for Professor McGonagall. So much for an attempt to bury the hatchet and get back together.

Why the bloody hell had Seamus brought up what his name meant? /Lavender Brown/ wanted to start a club about Nature Names.

He had to keep running. Just keep running. Just keep running. Just keep running. Man, why didn't he pay attention when Harry and Ron used those secret passages? He could have used them to hide.

Just keep running. Just keep running, running, running.

"Oh no! Come back!"

The staircase to the next floor was moving away. He was stuck!

"There you are!"

Lavender Brown ran up to him, bouncing on the balls of her feet.

"So I was thinking, for the meeting of Nature Names, maybe we could have some Butterbeer."

Dean mused that he would need something much stronger than Butterbeer for a Nature Name Meeting.

He needed a way out of this. Lavender was going on about all the food she planned to have at the party. Heh, she had an appetite this girl, just like Ron.

Ron...Weasley...

Hmmm....

"You know what, Lavender?"

"What?"

"I just remembered--Ginny mentioned a while ago--"

"You two broke up! And it was really sad! I liked you two together! You did much better than me and Won-Won ever did...though it was rather stupid of me to think Won-won would chose me over Mo-ney Mo."

/The Rapture will happen before Won Won and Mo-ney Mo get together...oh God, now she's got me doing this./

"Er...right. Well, Ginny doesn't have any sisters and I have a bunch of little ones she was curious about how I always had to play tea party with mine.

--------------

"A tea party?" Ginny Weasley blinked.

*** Part II

--------------

"A tea party?" Ginny Weasley blinked. Lavender looked like she might burst with excitement.

"It'll be great! Parvati and I sneak food up to our dormitory all the time, but we've never made a tea party out of it. And Dean said you've never had a tea party before all you ever had growing up were your brothers. So this will be your chance to have sisters!"

"I /have/ a sister." Ginny retorted.

"You consider Hermione your sister? That's /so/ sweet! She can be there too!"

"Two sisters then. Hermione and Luna."

"Awwwwwwww!"

"Not what I meant. But for Luna--after the way you've laughed at her, no way."

Lavender actually looked rather ashamed of herself.

"You're right. Laughing at her was wrong. The earrings looked silly and the Quibbler stuff...but...It's not she's hurting anyone. I'm really, really sorry about that."

"Well..."

"Where is Luna anyway? She can come too!"

I gotta go to work, sorry guys.
