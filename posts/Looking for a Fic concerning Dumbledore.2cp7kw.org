I was reading when a thought occurred to me and I was hoping that one the literary genius' out there have already written about it, however I'm unable to find what I'm looking for.

I was wondering whether there has been any kind of fic concerning a Young Dumbledore, not at his age, but around Cannon times. Either an accident or an intentional event that causes him to regain his youth. The age isnt entirely important but my preference would have been between around or just after teens. Obviously with this particular gem you could open up a world of Slash fictions and it's not something I'm against :P

Of course It'd be Dumbledore powerful, intelligent, just renewed.

As always, thank you for reading, and in advance for any suggestions you come up with...


** Accident? /Never./ The dude had access to a Philosopher's Stone in the first book. Hell, he could have been all over that easily enough. The question is, does the Stone prolong life only, or does it also rejuvenate?

*** Hmm, the stones properties involving rejuvenation is never expanded upon to my knowledge, merely it's capability to prevent death as long as Elixir is drank regularly, curious thought though to consider that Flamel could have deteriorated into talking dust or a brain in a jar...

I would admit though, Dumbledore as an imaginative and genius manipulative bastard isnt really what I most enjoy reading about. Dumbledore bashing IS fun, but I do like the grandfather figure in him. He may have raised Harry for slaughter, but I think his appearance in limbo must mean he felt that what happened would happen regarding the Horcrux's destruction.

**** I wasn't thinking along the manipulative!Dumbledore root... More that there doesn't seem to be a point in going to all the trouble of creating a really clever plot device to provide him with eternal youth, when one's been handed to you on a silver platter in the form of the Philosopher's Stone.

** In Light Of Silver Memories is not the same thing, but at least similar. But maybe you haven't heard of that one, yet. I also remember there being a fic similar to In Light of Silver Memories posted in [[/r/hpfanfiction]]

*** Thank you for the suggestion, I'll look that one up immediately. I understand the idea is a little vague, who could imagine someone older than time actually being a teenager :D

** Taure's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9778984/1/The-One-He-Feared][The One He Feared]] probably matches what you want, for the most part. 33k words, last updated on Oct 2013. The writing is of high quality and is mostly canon-consistent.

  Post-HBP. As Harry is preparing to leave Privet Drive for the last time, he receives a mysterious package. Now Harry, armed with the memories of Albus Dumbledore, must take charge of his destiny. No bashing, mostly canon compliant.
#+end_quote

The story shares qualities with In Light of Silver Memories, mentioned already by [[/u/chaosmosis]].
