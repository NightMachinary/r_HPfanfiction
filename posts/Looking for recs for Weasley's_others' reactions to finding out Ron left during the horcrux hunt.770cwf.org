** Whats there to react? Ron had a breakdown due to stress and horcrux influence, and apparated. Ended up running into snatchers in short order (what are the odds? but thats Rowlings fault) and afterwards tried to find them again, but they had left already.

People tend to make a way too big deal out of the whole thing. Breakdowns happen in such situations, Ron just isn't as strong willed as the other two, but most people aren't.

*** Because I like to read to one shots? Because I've always thought it would be interesting to think of what would happen when they found out Ron had been to Bills at Christmas when they probably all worried sick about him.?

I'm not wanting them to be mad at him. I just like fics that deal with the aftermath of the war and the wounds and issues they inflicted. Perhaps this is just me, though.

*** But it's also a huge contention point for people who ship Ginny and Harry, or Romione. Because people go "??? What happened while you two were alone??" It's a suspicion that is very much realistic. I'd find it interesting to explore the levels of trust others have towards Hermione, particularly Mrs. Weasley.

**** I don't think there were any ron/hermione shippers among canon characters. I suppose since Harry and Ginny were sort of together, there would be A point of potential contention, although i would think that with Voldemort in charge people would have bigger problems and that instead of "Are they f-ing like rabbits because they are alone" it would be more like "are they rotting in a ditch?". The latter wouldn't add much to a story.

I suppose seeing the whole year from another characters pov could be interesting, but I doubt anyone would realistcally have too great a reaction from Ron leaving

***** Thing is, it is common, in times of war, for people to do desperate things. We have two hormonal teenagers, alone, with awful feelings, thinking they could die any day; the possibility of something happening, probably not romantic but just out of desperation to feel something other than despair, is very plausible. I would think these reactions happen after Voldemort has been killed, because no one would get the full story until after the War, we all know how Mrs. Weasley was towards Hermione during the 4th book with Rita Skeeter. Or the fact that Hermione and Harry slept in the same bed, for someone's character like Ron, who is easily prone to jealousy, would make for one hell of a story. Especially seeing as Hermione seems to be a woman who would not have sex until after she was married, verifying Hermione's virginity (I hate that phrase) would simply have to be taking her at her word. And we all know how well that has gone with people listening to her.

****** You have a point about how it might cause a minor issue after the war. I can see how a tabloid writer could make such insinuations were he to find out. Seems a bit petty to me, for people to pay any attention to it, but lots of people are.

BTW, altered memories or memory charms could also be identified in the Pensieve.

**** I agree, I'd still love to read a scene that explores these character dynamics. It's the spirit of fanfiction, to either change the canon world, or fill in the gaps of the original novels

#+end_quote

That's not very fair. I daresay Ron has a stronger will than the other two, seeing as how he faces his fear on a regular basis and even does things that your basic instincts tell you not to do.

Ron is emotionally vulnerable. His insecurities and fears and worry are worn on his sleeve and are much more tangible than Harry's and Hermione's. In the sense of things, Ron's under a lot more pressure and has a lot more eating at him than the other two. He has a family to worry about who could be tortured or killed if he's discovered. Hermione's parents are in Australia and Harry's family is dead. He has to worry about feeling useless, since he's hindering them with his injury, even if they lack any direction.

So I don't think Ron has the weakest will. I believe he's the most sensitive and down to earth, without that inherent do-gooder attitude Harry and Hermione have. He only went with them to support his friends, not because he wanted to save the world.

*** I also think it because of the poor writing in the way Rowling wrote Ron Weasley as a character. He is a bad friend, he has never had to work at home or in school, he has never had been hunger for more than a a day, he is not very smart. He has a temper, all he cares is food, sleep, and Quidditch. I have never understand as too why he is as big a character as he was. To me that is a ,one of the many, big flaw in the Potter books.

**** I'm not a Ron fan either, he leaves a lot to be desired as the best friend/sidekick to the main character, but you're leaving out the stuff he does do.

Going to stop who they thought was Snape - actually Quirrel.

Following Harry into the Forbidden Forest despite the fact that they're dealing with his arachnophobia.

Following Harry into the lair of the Basilisk.

Sticking by him even though Voldemort has returned and is undoubtedly gunning for Harry.

***** It's JK's writing at fault right here. She makes those things seem minscule. She shows no character development for Ron at all, or even Hermione at all. There are so many fallacies or plot holes in her writing. She says Ron is a master strategist in the first book and then promptly forgets that piece of information. She could fleshed out the character more in my opinion.

** Ignoring all the babble up above, there is a fic that has a scene where everyone finds out Ron was at Bill's for Christmas. It was a story from Ginny's POV during DH. I'm going to try and track it down.

It's kinda like the Year of Darkness fic (Neville's POV during DH), but with Ginny and a bit less fleshed out in a couple of ways.
