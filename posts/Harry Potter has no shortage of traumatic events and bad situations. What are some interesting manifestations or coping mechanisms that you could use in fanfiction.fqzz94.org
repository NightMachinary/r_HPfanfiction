Okay, so I was chatting on a post here the other day and it got me thinking of a fic I'm sort-of working on (planning phase at the moment) and how I want to take the time to investigate how the sorts of events in canon would impact the characters, in particular how they cope and how the issues manifest in the characters.

Let's take Harry for example.

His cupboard is small, dark, and lonely. But it was /safe/, no one could hurt him while he was in there. Harry with Agoraphobia (fear of open spaces)?

Aunt Marge raises dogs that bit at his legs. Cynophobia (fear of dogs)?

Trust issues are obvious, as his aunt, uncle, and cousin aren't exactly the most trustworthy sort.

Perfectionist? Get his chores right the first time (and in a timely manner) or be yelled at/punished.

Probably some issues in interpersonal relationships, never had a friend before.

There was a prompt here recently about him hoarding food, that's a good one.

Or how about other characters?

Ron could easily develop tunnel vision, focusing on the things he's good at, a competitive streak, proving he's just as good as his brothers, and a general inferiority complex. Being the youngest of six brothers /has/ to take a toll on someone.

Hermione could be fun. High intelligence can lead to poor social issues, she could be overtrusting of people, overtrusting of books, etc. I believe the DnD term is "High Intelligence, Low Wisdom".

Neville's got a inferiority complex, not helped by using his father's wand instead of getting his own. The whole "dropped out a window because they thought he was a squib" thing probably doesn't help.

Ginny was possessed for several months. You could run a few personality and identity issues off of that.

Luna can see threstrals. Which you can only see if you "have seen death". So... was she nearby when her mother died? I'm also of the opinion that the creatures she talks about are her way of dealing with problems she doesn't think she can handle. So instead of bullies, because Luna can't handle bullies (at least in first year), she uses nargles or whatever because she knows those (either she made them up, her dad's a magi-cryptozoologist, or they're just obscure creatures in other countries, it doesn't matter).

And /Draco!/ Where do you even /begin/ with this guy? His superiority complex? His indoctrinated sense of bigotry? The fact that his main male role model is basically a Nazi? The fact that he's a rich ponce?

So, I pose the question to /you/, the sub: What interesting issues can you give the characters, and how would those issues manifest?


** Another issue of Harry's is extremely and I mean extremely low expectations and extreme introversion.

#+begin_quote
  Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn't have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself -- no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.

*** Combine that with Harry's extreme lack of self worth and his passive suicidal ideation. He believes his life is worthless compared to that of others like when he jumps on the back of a mountain troll to save a classmate, goes to the Chamber to save a girl in spite of the basilisk, his hesitation to let others risk their lives to protect him but his easy acceptance of his own death.

*** Ooh, that's a nice one. Extreme introversion combined with the Agoraphobia and trust issues I talked about would be really interesting. I just imagine Harry hiding under his bed at Hogwarts because it's nice, dark, and he doesn't have to deal with people.

Low expectations could work nicely as well, especially if it's of himself. Give him something to really overcome, seeing just how good he really is after "ten dark years" of being beaten down.

**** When he is feeling overwhelmed by people in a hallway going to class he could try to get away by ducking into a broom cupboard but its already occupied by a couple snogging. that would be funny

***** That sounds hilarious. Whenever I actually get around to writing the fic that goes with this discussion (and who knows when /that/ will be) I'll have to remember to do that.

You know, this Harry would be /terrible/ in Potions. Someone who gets so overwhelmed they try and hide in broom cupboards isn't really going to last long against Snape. Or Umbrich, come to think of it. Not that anyone can really deal with Umbrich, but this would be worse.

**** He would not have any expectations of himself after the life he led. Just what he was told to do. He would do that much and nothing more. Like if some one told him to try for Quidditch or to read Quidditch books he would do it otherwise he would just stay huddled under his nice dark bed.

***** You say that like he wouldn't take his wand, cast Lumos, and read /while/ under his nice dark bed.

If you took this idea a bit further you'd probably have Ron and/or Hermione help him discover some self worth, culminating in him saying "no" to something (maybe leaving the Quidditch team because he doesn't enjoy it?).

****** Yeah this Harry would hate Quidditch. So much open space. His Agoraphobia at that would be worse than Ron's Arachnophobia.

And he would definitely do everything under his bed. I can imagine him doing his homework under the bed with his wand in one hand shining Lumos while he does it.

******* I don't think he'd hate Quidditch itself, if he had a way to watch without being outside maybe he'd find it quite interesting. It's /playing/ it that he would hate.

I know this sub kinda hates them, but I could see this sort of Harry getting one of those extended trunks. Just a small one, so it's all nice and cozy. Like, it's big enough to hold one comfy chair, a light of some kind, and a small space for some books or something.

The "Harry lives out of his trunk" thing is a bit overdone, yeah, but I think it could work. Portable safe space for him. If he gets overwhelmed, and I imagine a Harry that hides under his bed from people /would/ get overwhelmed, he can just retreat into his trunk for a bit.

********* Thanks. I could totally see Harry deliberately measuring it out, so it's not too big.

And I mean this thing is like, cupboard sized. A large cupboard maybe, at most it's a walk in wardrobe, but this isn't a /room/. Harry gets it /because/ it's small and compact. And then puts stuff in it to make it feel even smaller.

This Harry likes small spaces.

** One of my headcanons is draco having an inferiority complex and developing an eating disorder because of it. Maybe it's a lot of projection from my part but it fits quite well. While yes, outwards he's an arrogant twat, but maybe it's more of a fake it til you make it/don't let others see your weakness thing? We see lucius shaming draco for having worse grades than a muggleborn, and i do think there was always a strong expectation hanging over draco to do well. Only son of lucuis malfoy and narcissa black, purest of blood, etc. Why shouldn't he be the top of the top in everything? But harry beats him in quidditch, hermione beats him in grades, and in hbp he realizes he can't kill dumbledore. He can't do anything well enough and striving for perfection develops into an eating disorder. We see draco being sent food from home by his mother, which could very well be a worried mother making sure her son eats /something/. Also the choice of friends in crabbe and goyle could be a "look at how smart i am in comparison to these two" thing.

*** So some weird combination of superiority complex (because his breeding says he's better than other people) and inferiority complex (because the people he's meant to be better than keep getting higher scores)?

And the eating disorder could be interesting, from a fic standpoint, to do. Especially if you run it alongside the probable eating issues that Harry has (I mentioned a post of him hoarding hoarding food that I liked in the OP). An interesting playoff, Harry eats too much because he thinks it'll disappear if he's slow, and Draco barely eats at all because of his own issues.
