  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

  Follow Rodrick, grandson of Gellert Grindelwald, as he struggles with his own identity in a world both magical and dangerous. Will he ever be able to step out of his grandfather's shadow? Maybe if nobody finds out his family name in the first place. Though, of course, having a Grindelwald's morales doesn't make things any easier. Disclaimer: J.K Rowling owns Harry Potter.

** In the Albus Potter series by NoahPhantom (seven completed books), Albus Potter becomes by the end of the story comparable in power with Dumbledore. The thing I like about it is that Albus doesn't use any shortcut to get to that level but he is just curious about learning magic. Also his mentor and the main antagonist are even more powerful so the final confrontation still comes down to outsmarting the enemy.

** linkffn(the pureblood pretense) series.

pureblood pretense /does/ have magical cores, but its like as if the premise of the fic is "how can we make this trope good?"

it has a really excellent magic system in the latter books. the first book (pureblood pretense) has some flaws (a tiny bit kid politicians, maybe can use some more fleshed out worldbuilding), but those flaws quickly fall away later on and it becomes rlly rlly good.

** Theres one called "Fate" by TheTrueSpartan. It's a Ron centric story, personally found it very enjoyable... It is 2 million+ words though. Took me 5 days to read it all.

Also, don't know how to use that link thing everyones doing, looks neat. Haven't been in the FF community for a few years now.

EDIT: It should be noted that there are themes of timetravel that are hinted at more than outright stated and Ron can be op, but it's just too good not to mention

#+begin_quote
  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Mary Sues, no Character bashing.
