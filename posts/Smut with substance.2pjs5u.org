I like my smut, but so much of the time it pushes plot to the back burner. Anyone have recommendations that has one without compromising the other?

Note: My favorite pairings are Tom Riddle/Voldemort & Hermione (by far my absolute fav.), Severus/Hermione Draco/Hermione, and Lucius/Hermione. But I'd be willing to consider another pairing if there is something compelling about the story.


** If you haven't yet read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3494886/1/Eden][Eden,]] go do that now! It's a Lucius/Hermione fic and it is an absolutely compelling story. It's probably one of my favorite stories in the entire HP fandom.

A few M rated SS/HG stories I really liked were [[http://www.thepetulantpoetess.com/viewstory.php?sid=754][Guard...Check...Mate]], Caramel by corianderpie (on Ashwinder but the site is going through maintenance), [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7093944/1/Yea-Though-I-Walk][Yea Though I Walk]], [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/311126/chapters/498237][Second Life]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8455295/1/An-Unwritten-Future][An Unwritten Future]].

Some M rated Dramione fics I really liked were [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6291747/1/Isolation][Isolation]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3732710/1/Silencio][Silencio]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4411159/1/Claiming-Hermione][Claiming Hermione]] (Abandoned), [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2083937/1/Bad-Faith][Bad Faith]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1729481/1/Valentine-Encounter][Valentine Encounter]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5095119/1/The-Dragon-s-Bride][The Dragon's Bride]].

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5572429/1/Picture-Retribution][This]] story is my favorite. It's a little dark in spots, but with plenty of smut and a good story. Basically Draco has to marry and have a son by 30 or her loses Malfoy Manor, and Hermione agrees to help in exchange for him helping her parents out financially.

** Shit dude, go check out witchfics.org. Do it right now. Do not pass go, do not collect $200.

That site hasn't been updated in a million years, but some of my favourite stories of all time are there.

Check out anything by Anna, Riley's "Pawn to Queen", and anything by Abby.

** I'm going to assume by "substance" you don't mean a full-on plot because then we're not really talking about smut any more, but rather a normal story that just so happens to have sex scenes.

So I'm interpreting "smut with substance" as a story whose primary focus is smut but which has some kind of narrative or context rather than people just having sex in a vacuum.

*Harry/Pansy*

I admit I'm a huge sucker for Harry/Pansy, which is annoying because there's not much out there. I think it works for a few reasons: they're not friends, so there's no risk of sickly sweet fluff; we know that Pansy has physical imperfections so she feels more real; but at the same time she still has a certain sexiness to her, with the whole "rich trust fund chick" thing -- a bit of a bad girl.

Fortunately, though there aren't loads of Harry/Pansy fics, there are a few that are very well written, all of them by a single author: thusspakekate.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10100723/1/Parkinson-s-Knickers-Or-Lack-Thereof][Parkinson's Knickers (Or Lack Thereof)]]

Harry always knew the monthly budget meetings were boring, but he didn't realize just how boring until Pansy Parkinson offered to show him something a little more interesting.

This is the perfect Harry/Pansy for me.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9673766/1/The-More-Your-Ignore-Me-The-Closer-I-Get][The More Your Ignore Me (The Closer I Get)]]

It's been a month since Harry broke up with Pansy Parkinson, and he can't get her out of his head. Literally.

This one has a slight fluffy part to it, but not in a sickly sweet way.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8785245/1/Sunday-Morning][Sunday Morning]]

Harry loves these lazy Sunday mornings. Written for the fifth round of kink bingo, with the featured kink: somnophilia/sleepy sex. PWP. Adult content inside.

Pretty much pure sex, but it's H/P so I'm sticking it here.

By a different author:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5238217/1/A-Taste-of-Ice][A Taste of Ice]]

Harry takes an unintended detour at Hogwarts while Horcrux-hunting. Rated M for adult content and language. Bit on the dark side. The original version can be found at my LJ.

Somewhat darker, a bit dodgy, and not as well written, but hey it has Pansy in.

*Harry/Hermione*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5479108/1/Dirty-Laundry][Dirty Laundry]]

Alone and suffering in the forest on Christmas, Harry and Hermione steal a moment just for themselves.

One of innumerable "DH tent smut" fics, but this is among the best in that it isn't written by a die-hard Harmonian.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5709167/1/Adventures-in-the-Prefects-Bath][Adventures in the Prefects' Bath]]

Set during Book 4, this story departs from canon after Harry hears the clue in the egg, when he experiences an unexpected and eye-opening encounter with his best female friend. One thing leads to another, with a much more pleasant conclusion to the year.

Shippy and has an absolutely absurd ending, but the opening scene is good.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3379006/1/Hot][Hot]]

Something that I wrote during the hot summer and now that winter is here I thought we could use a warm up! Harry and Hermione having fun in the summer.

Characters are a bit OOC but it's the least shippy of the "Harry spends summer with Hermione" genre of smut.

*Harry/Other*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6649950/1/Christmas-Magic][Christmas Magic]]

Harry is having fun with Ginny, but finds himself incredibly jealous of Luna's boyfriend... and Luna has been invited for a Weasley Christmas... H/G - H/L - A bit of fluffy, saucy, smutty fun.

There's a less smutty prequel but it's not necessary to read it. Moderately realistic take on teen hormonal behaviour lol.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5445767/1/Whatever-Happened-to-Bromance][Whatever Happened to Bromance?]]

Cormac McLaggen explains a few simple truths to Harry, with profound consequences. Harry/Romilda. Smut.

Another "realistic take on teen hormonal behaviour" fic. Realistic smut including a very nervous Harry, but also lots of comedy elements too.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2127558/1/Narcotic-Effects][Narcotic Effects]]

After the final battle Harry can find solace in nothing and believes himself to be a failure because of the loss of his friends. A certain manipulative, platinum haired woman decides to yank him out of the downward spiral that is his life. HarryNarcissa.

This one is a classic. I haven't read it in years so I don't know how well it's aged, but at the time it came out it set the standard for smut.

*Harry/Multi*

Not harem fics, before you roll your eyes XD

[[http://restrictedsection.org/story.php?story=1458][The Best of a Bad Situation]]

Harry's had a bad week, and now he's been locked in a room with four giggling girls and a bottle of vodka. What's a boy to do?

The best example of "truth or dare smut". Harry, Hermione, Ginny, Lavender and Parvati trapped in a room, drunk, playing truth or dare. Ignore the bit where Harry is basically sexually assaulted and the fic is a very good example of slow build-up and teasing the reader.

I think you need a RestrictedSection.org account to read.

[[http://www.patronuscharm.net/s/66/1/][Testing Defences]]

Hermione decides to test the wards on Privet Drive by spending a night with Harry. And then it's Luna's turn. Then Katie's, and Fleur's, and Lisa's...

This is the smut version of the fluff fic you'll find on FF.Net.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5446275/1/It-Could-Only-Happen-to-Harry][It Could Only Happen to Harry]]

After defeating Voldemort in his final year, Harry requires a rare ritual to save his life. Luckily, he has friends who are willing to help him. H/Hr, H/Parv, H/Luna, H/Tonks, H/Fleur. Canon personalities. WARNING: comic smut. Not for younger audiences.
