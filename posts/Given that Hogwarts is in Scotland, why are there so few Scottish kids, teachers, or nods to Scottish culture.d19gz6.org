Know any fics that add some in? For example, Hogsmeade should be a wee Scottish village. Wizards in robes should blend in much easier with kilt-wearing Scottish muggle men. The Hogwarts kids should be hearing some different accents, getting a flavour of the local atmosphere, so different from Muggle and Magical London.

Anyway, let's discuss and think about in this thread!

E: I should note that I'm very familiar with Scotland, having lived in it for a number of years, and I'm not just pulling stereotypes out of my ass - it just struck me as incredibly incongruous today the contrast between the setting we have and the way that setting doesn't seem to inform the characters or world whatsoever apart from being remote. For example; were the Founders Scottish? When did Wizarding Scotland join with Wizarding England? (or /has/ it???)


** I mean firstly Scottish men don't wear kilts all the time.

But secondly - Hogwarts and Hogsmeade are emphasised to be remote and they collect witches and wizards from all over GB & NI. The appeal of Hogsmeade is that it's the only entirely wizarding settlement, so people will have moved there from all over the place and there wouldn't be much opportunity to interact with Scottish Muggles at all.

*** Sure - I live in Scotland :p

I guess I just find it striking that in a series mostly set in Scotland, written in Edinburgh, there's really next to nothing Scottish that I can think of - nearly all main characters seem to be English.

**** Well, it would be odd if there was a particularly strong Scottish presence... Scots represent, what, 7-8% of the UK population? And Hogwarts is a British school, not a Scottish school. It just so happens to be located in Scotland.

It's also worth noting that magical Britain has been unified for much longer than Muggle Britain. The Wizards' Council ruled over both magical England and Scotland as early as 1269.

** To be fair, most Scottish men don't wear kilts in everyday life and you wouldn't see them in Hogsmeade anyway since it's a fully wizarding village.

But I totally agree with you on the accents front - not just different Scottish accents, but other British regional accents. Snape's a Brummie, Dumbledore's from the West Country, Remus is Welsh (or is that just my headcanon?) - I assume it's because it's fairly difficult to write an accent, but I try and pepper my fics with regional words/turns of phrase.

** Ravenclaw was Scottish, I believe.

But wizards and muggles don't interact unless wizards want to/are forced to and, going by canon, wizards typically don't want to.

** I'm gonna guess that they wanted to tone down the number and strength of the accents to make sure the audience didn't have trouble understanding the speakers.

*** Could be. I feel like for local flavour Hermione at least could have made some comments here and there. In a US context, its as if a Californian cast of kids went off to school in Texas for the majority of their year for 7 years and never once did anyone remark on the cultural differences or even that they'd never travelled out that direction before.

It would have been great to see some magical equivalents of e.g. the local wildlife as an injoke to Scottish readers or to establish the setting.

  Inspired by a post on Tumblr, this is a AU story set during Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts, with one big, foul-mouthed difference. Instead of Horace Slughorn, the position of Potions professor will be taken on by...Gordon Ramsay.

** Probably because what is happening now - the lines between cultures blurring and some cultures vanishing outright! - has been happening with wizards for centuries (they have had instand travel and communications for centuries after all and we muggles only have had planes available to the masses for what? 50 years? Cars for 100 years (but available to everybody probably only since WW2!) and the internet only for 30 years!)

Also I doubt there are that many scottish wizards and witches!
