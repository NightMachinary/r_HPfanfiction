I was just wondering if, since it's so notoriously bad, someone, at any point, had decided to challenge themselves with taking the same /premise/ as "My Immortal" ("Raven" at Hogwarts, people turn into vampire, Voldemort was to kidnap Raven for some reason) and tried to write it seriously. Not that even the premise is any good, mind you, but I could see ways to make into a non-terrible fanfic.

  As my senior project, I'm rewriting all of My Immortal as well as I can. Why? Because Tumblr told me to. Anyway, I hope you all enjoy my attempt to make this story any better than it actually is. If you have any suggestions on how to lengthen this a little bit, please tell me.xxxXXX Fangs for reading you guys! XXXxxx(I do not own any of the characters who appear in this work)
