Is there any HP SI fanfictions where the SI does not know the story, doesn't remember the HP series, but is gender savvy enough to guess, preferably he knows Naruto and sees the similarities of Orochimaru and Voldemort, and guesses the existence of horcruxes from there.


** Oh, this would be interesting. Would probably work best with an author asking someone who's never read or watched the harry potter books what they would do if they knew blank was happening, and then tailoring their responses to fit the fic.

#+begin_quote
  (Translated from Russian) A genre savvy but ignorant of canon SI replaces Voldemort right after the murder of James Potter. Featuring a villain protagonist, everyday realities of the Dark Side, and conquest of Magical Britain through terrorism. Inspired by The Evil Overlord List and 48 Laws of Power.

** Harry Potter world is a world of secrets, puzzles, and mystery. If you are going there with all the knowledge in your head then you are just ruining the story from the start. On the other hand if you are as blind as everyone else, but are genre savvy enough to think things...

I would assume someone without HP knowledge but Naruto knowledge would think the Dark Mark to be holding pieces of Voldemort's soul, that is why he wasn't killed for good. Then they would either go around killing purebloods to kill Voldemort, or try to find a way to defeat him without killing him.

They would be very suspicious of Harry Potter himself due to Kabuto being Orochimaru v2.

They may consider Ron the chosen one even, due to his poor but loving family. Also Ron does have this King Arthur vibe going for him.

Hermione is clearly the Cinderella what with being ugly, smart, and once she straightens out her looks she suddenly turns drop dead georgeus.

Neville is the side kick, no one of importance, the future friendly fat guy in family shows, he may become a deus ex machina guy that gives the last push needed to kill the big bad, but in general he is just the comedic relief character.

Draco is the unloved son of a man stuck between rock and a hard place, his parents probably actually Imperio'ed and Lucius is clearly afraid for his family so he follows what he is being told.

Sirius Black is clearly Harry Potter's answer to Bellatrix Black of Voldemort.

Albus is the supreme good in the story, he is the jesus, he is the aslan, he is the god in human-form, he may even be secretly merlin himself!

Snape is the untrustworthy spy, or maybe he is Scar if we are going with Simba.

I am seeing so many possibilities here. Where the SI screws everything up, like killing Harry, killing Snape, siding with the Malfoys, thinking Dark Magic as not Evil but merely the destructive part of magic, overestimating Dumbledore at every turn until (due to his failures) starting to think of him as the big big bad behind Voldemort and Grindelwart, and etc.

*** Also Dobby is Golum. He desires something, whether it be freedom where upon he would return to his fey roots or some item of power, or maybe he just wants to side with the great dark lord Harry Potter, and the whole bludger and other things were his attempts at testing Harry Potter to decide whether he is someone worth following.

you could easily remedy that by inserting them far enough back for it not to matter or set them in an alternate timeline

#+begin_quote
  The Rule all Self Insert/Time Travelers should follow: do not attempt to arrange plots based on hindsight, the ripples in time will fracture continuity rendering your past knowledge ineffectual. You are to acquire every morsel of an advantage as you can, as quickly as possible with the power at your disposal, while exposing yourself to as little risk as possible
#+end_quote

instead of trying to plot you should simply have fun in a magical world

Then you should just go ahead and write a story full of OCs and your own interpretation of Harry Potter, any age other than Harry Potter's is too unknown to be written without making loads of assumptions about too many things.

For your advice... You are right. We should focus on the fun, but can you really have fun if you know how to kill the terrorist that every person you talk to is afraid of mentioning? Can you feel comfortable knowing that the people you know, maybe even your own family, will get hurt at the hands of a group of people following an insane near immortal whose only focus in causing pain to escape from his own misery?

And what would you do/feel if the hero, Harry, fails? If Harry dies because you didn't help but caused just enough ripples to rock the boat and cause it to sink helm first?

** in order to write a proper ff(you simply cannot do a proper job based on second hand knowledge) you must have read the series and a Self Insert means you the writer are inserted into the world thus a proper SI FF would always have Meta anything else would be OC or OIC(Original Insert Character) not SI

*** You may merely write it off as the ROB that threw you into the story just scrubbed you memories of the world you are in. Maybe you know the title, maybe you know Voldy's past, but you wouldn't know of the locations, wouldn't know the traps, would know the assumptions like Dumbledore being evil for making the obstacle course on Philosopher's Stone easy enough for the three first years to clear.

If you just hand the knowledge to the SI then it gets too repetitive, too... Simple. Go grab this and that, make sure Dumbly doesn't die, go use either Fiendfyre or kill the Basilisk too for its fang, or maybe use Harry's Parseltongue to make it ally with you, make a trap either during the Goblet of Fire, or during the Ministry raid, or something.

Too simple and too overdone already, we need something new.
