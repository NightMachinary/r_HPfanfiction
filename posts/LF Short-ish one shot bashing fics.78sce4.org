  When Ron left them Harry wondered why he hadn't seen it coming. After all, Ron always left when things got hard. He was sorted for bravery, not loyalty.

****** Well, it was really excellent. The timing is particularly great, because I had just read your boyfriend's story before seeing this thread.

There was another thread (I can't remember) where someone was mentioning Combat Pragmatists, and someone mentioned about reading it on TVTropes. Checked it out, and your story was one of the recommendations for the Harry Potter Fanfiction category: [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/CombatPragmatist/FanFiction]]
