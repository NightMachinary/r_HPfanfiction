** ...Is there anything in particular about Blackpool you'd like to see replicated? "Captivating and clever and enjoyable" are pretty subjective terms, after all.

*** Fair enough. It's hard for me to pin down what makes me love it so much. I think I'm relying on people who know it to sort of know what I'm talking about.

I think it's these elements of the story that I love: character(s)-driven story; professional-quality writing; subtly funny; the author has a level of maturity that shines through.

Ugh, reading that back, I'm not sure that's any more helpful, but that's what I got.

**** I've read and enjoyed Blackpool, but I think it's hard for me to pin down what I liked so much about it too. But I do have a couple of fics that may or may not hit the same buttons:

  It's 1976 and Hogwarts' N.E.W.T. Divination class can only see the homework in their future. Lily Evans and Sirius Black certainly can't foresee they're falling into friendship. What happens in Divination, stays in Divination.

  Three days after he turns fourteen, Sirius Black is called home, to spend some quality time with his loving family before he's killed by the Ministry's Disposal of Dangerous Creatures Squad.One month later, Orion Black is dead, Sirius is alive, and Walburga has no choice but give him the title he's never wanted - and along with it, a nice fat bullseye on his head. Sirius realises why he wasn't allowed to turn down the Ring of the Blacks: for that to happen, he must die.Not twenty-four hours into the Succession Ritual, he's seriously considering it as an option.Life is unfair like that.Notes: Sister fic to Thirteen Moons and plays between Chapters 3 and 6, prequel to Runaway, AU

** I loved Blackpool as well! I'm really enjoying the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1036611][The Black Sheep Dog]] series by izzythehutt.

In the Black is the first part and is complete. Black Mask is the second part and is on-going; the latest chapter was just published today.

It's another Black family fic. It's character-driven and definitely has one of the best written Sirius's I've read. linkao3(14800721) linkao3(15457248)

  Regulus Black survives his adventure in the cave and brings the locket to an unlikely ally: his estranged older brother. The ex-Death Eater strikes a bargain with Dumbledore, cooperation in exchange for his family's safety. Sirius Black is faced with his toughest mission yet: managing Walburga and Orion Black---who, to his surprise and dismay, decide they rather enjoy having both of their sons back, and very quickly scheme to make this temporary family reunion permanent.Or: the story of how one night completely changed the course of the war and Sirius's life.[AU of the First Wizarding War in which stealing part of Voldemort's soul brings a broken, dysfunctional family together]

  Christmas 1979---danger, secrets, lies and their shared history looms large over the Blacks' first Yuletide season as a reunited family. While life as a fugitive proves bleaker (and more boring) than Regulus could have imagined, a botched espionage mission at Malfoy Manor draws Sirius deeper into the Black family web---and his cousin Narcissa's social set.Meanwhile, Walburga hatches a daring scheme to restore her wild firstborn's damaged reputation in the family---finding him a suitable bride---while Orion grapples with the past, and the high price his two sons have paid for his inaction.[Regulus Black Lives/Black Family Witness Protection AU.

  COMPLETE. When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost. It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything.
