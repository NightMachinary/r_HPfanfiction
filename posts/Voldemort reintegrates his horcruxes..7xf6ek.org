I just read Ynyr's "Yes I am Harry's Brother linkffn(8192853)

In this story Voldemort accidentally regains a body when Harry is 5yrs old and then sets about recovering and merging his horcruxes back into his soul, all the while pretending to be Harry's (half) brother.

It was somewhat interesting, but had a bunch of annoyances (ie: Harry is basically a dupe in this fic.) So I was scratching my head trying to think of any other decent stories where Voldemort decided that it was a good idea to reclaim and re-merge(?) his horcruxes back into himself.

I couldn't think of any, but I'm assuming some of you know of some?

#+begin_quote
  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

** linkao3(Sympathy of Souls)...? I think that's what it's called? on Ao3. An interesting story to be sure, with clever worldbuilding (Horcruxes and the Philosopher's Stone work a bit differently in this story, it's all gradually revealed).

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. Story is high on Political intrigue.
