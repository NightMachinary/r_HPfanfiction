I recently read two fics, one where Harry is some kind of Eldrich horror child due to the horcrux and eats kittens and bunny's which was kinda weird but with an AMAZING atmosphere (FFNET Whelped by Casscade) and the second was a time travel/fix-it fic where PETUNIA travels back in time, leaves Vernon and is involved in the first wizarding world in order to protect her sister. (Flowers by the Wayside by TalaRae) These fics, to me, were very unique.

I've mainly focused on Harry-Centric fics and, to my knowledge, a Good!Petunia fic is VERY rare. I'm starving for more unique fics. I don't mine if it's not a 'never been done before' fic so long as it has a unique twist on its circumstance.

I don't much like Harry/Ginny as a couple and I prefer Harry-centric but if it's like the Petunia fic, I wanna read it.

I just need something basically pull me in, you know? Something that makes me think 'shit, I can't put this down'.


** Would it be funny to link that one ancient fic about going to a school in the mountains somewhere because its description had "singularily unique fic" in it? Probably not.

Linkffn(The Arcanist: Unspeakable Mysteries) is a newer classic. I love its worldbuilding. It's essentially about a WBWL Harry, but goes off the rails /quickly/ with Harry as Albus' apprentice and the two of them journeying through the multiverse to rally help against a coming demon invasion. It's a bit anime-y in its power levels (every new monster is is the ultimate at everything and immortal and invulnerable /and/ shits rainbows), but I kinda liked that aspect. You don't often see a fic like this that doesn't pull punches.

Linkffn(The Archmage of Arda) is also relatively new, and is essentially a good powerwank crossover with LotR. Usually, you get either a masterpiece that could have been part of the original writings or some sort of weird fic that feels like one of those 80's tv shows' references to classic literature, but this one is godlike in that it does neither.

Linkffn(The Length and Breadth of Skyrim) is a pretty dope Elder Scrolls crossover. It's femslash, but has a very heavy focus on plot and the adventure. So far, it is essentially canon Hermione in Skyrim's Dawnguard DLC with an OC Dragonborn as the second protagonist, Serana as the third and Farkas as the fourth. I like this one because it doesn't treat one world as superior to the other. Some aspects are a little weird, but I like it nonetheless.

Linkffn(Shadow of Angmar) Pretty sure you've probably seen this one, but it still deserves to be here just for its quality. It reads like a seamless meshing of Tolkien's and JKR's books, and that is an extremely high bar to reach.

Linkffn(By the Divining Light) is like The Arcanist, but lite, spoopier and less powerwanky. Liked the eldritch aspects.

There was one which I don't remember the name of. It had Harry able to see the world as it truly was, which was predictably eldritch. It's implied that because he sees it it can see him too, and the entire story spirals into insanity. I remember him sacrificing that one girl who disappears in canon to some shadows, Dumbledore committing suicide because he finds out the afterlife isn't real and Voldemort being essentially not an issue becausd everything falls apart.

Linkffn(The Lone Traveller by The Professional) Once in a blue moon I come across someone who hasn't read this series. It's insanely long, written by like three authors. In essence, it features Harry as some sort of dimensional handyman that nudges that which needs to be nudged and then moves on. Later series expand the lore behind everything to an insane degree. Be sure to search it on google as well.

Linkffn(The Voyage of Starship Hedwig) Although I hate this fic for how it handled everything, it is still the only one of its type. Invincible will be ignored for being dumb. Essentially, it's about the wizards fleeing Earth in a massive spaceship powered by magic. It has immense quantities of needless character death, but some of the best aliens and out of the box thinking I've seen.

Linkffn(In the Mind of a Scientist) Behold, the only smart!harry fic where he is neither a Lord, nor inherits trillions, nor is an enormous asshole! Essentially, this fic uses the "mad scientist" trope on Harry. He cuts himself open, vivisects people consensually, puts a screw in his head. The first sequel crosses with Stargate, and is even better imo. The second sequel is garbage.

  The letter changed it all for the orphaned, abused little runaway with the messy black hair and the green, green eyes. Cassie's life was going to change but with vengeful teachers, manipulative headmasters and an uncaring wizarding world would it be for the better. Dark but not evil or overpowered FemHarry, eventual Femslash. Pretty close to canon apart from the obvious.

** if you want good!Petunia check out linkao3(15861804)

 

For unique fics, Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived ([[https://www.tthfanfic.org/wholestory.php?no=30822]]) is a nonmagical AU with a crossover with the James Bond universe told entirely from Hermione's PoV. Though while there is no magic super science/mad science can fill in that void. While it does stick surprisingly close to canon the first few years it is still entertaining to see /how/ it does so given the lack of magic. And the last two years, where things really go off the rails compared to canon, are by themselves half of the fic. And it definitely has some great and deep world building (and in my opinion does a much better job of explaining why some of the Weaselys take an instant dislike to Fleur, compared to canon where its just "well women kind of already naturally hate her, she's her son's girlfriend so Molly has to hate her/maybe doesn't like foreigners? and Ginny is just being an equal opportunity bitch to everyone?)

(Fair warning if you really don't like Hermione: She was already something of know it all/"know whatever is needed to advance the plot" in canon. In a universe where her intelligence and willingness to work ridiculous hours is truly rewarded rather than necessary to thrive in a system all but set against her, accusations of her being "Super Hermione" are perhaps not unfounded, though the series does a good job of justifying/showing how she acquires each ability).

 

One of my favorite fics on ao3 is a Sherlock crossover, though not in the way you think (ie. Harry solving mysteries with Sherlock and/or Watson) linkao3(1134255)

And speaking of unique crossovers, the only Addams Family crossover I've seen with Harry Potter is written by one of my favorite Harry Potter fic authors linkao3(21166118)

  AU. Petunia Evans might not have been a witch, but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. As a squib, Dr Evans found her niche: Discovering and exploring tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew as a single aunt.
