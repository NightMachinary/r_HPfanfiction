Crosspost from [[/r/videos][r/videos]]: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/i3qqkt/my_friend_edited_the_entire_first_harry_potter/]]

This trailer is hilarious. The entire trailer and movie has been edited with every wand being replaced by a gun. I couldn't stop laughing three seconds in.

Full movie here: [[https://harrypotterwithguns.com/]]


** Lmao wonderfully edited. It makes sense though, because wands are technically weapons. Imagine handing a gun to a 11-year-old boy without a license. Then they go to Hogwarts to learn how to control their weapons (magic).

**** Oh god, now I want a Metal Gear Solid--esque AU where Hogwarts is a seven-year-long elite secret boot camp for child soldiers, with a Voldemort as a tortured antihero holding a Snake-themed codename, Harry a genetically engineered freak that the government wants to use for their own ends, Dumbledore a ripped badass mission control that helps Harry during his adventures through the codec, long weird-as-hell philosophical debates about the nature of war and humanity, and crazy action.

*** Guns are not useless since they allow for very easy ambushes (the bullet hits you before you hear it fired) and at much higher effective range. They also allow you to pin people down since most shield spells in canon are static.

I mean, the Battle of Hogwarts was turned by a bunch of House Elves and Centaurs armed like a medieval peasant mob (various knifes and the like, arrows). So if even such primitive weapons were enough for the best Voldemort could field, imagine a real weapon. A bunch of machine guns for suppressing fire, a few mortars to flush them out of cover and so on. The only truly useless weapon would be a flamethrower.
