Slash is really the only thing I don't like to read.

**** linkffn(The Darkness Within) and it's two sequels.

linkffn(Grow Young With Me)

linkffn(Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always) and its sequel.

linkffn(What We're Fighting For)

linkffn(Exile by bennybear)

And some other stuff from James Spookie. They're only decent though, and got repetitive after awhile. Good if you're looking for some light hearted fluff that doesn't drag on.

I also didn't list some of the obvious fics from the top favorited list (The Life and Time, Delenda Est, Nightmare of the Future Past and such). If you can read harem and/or smut, maybe I can give more suggestions, though understandably the quality of those can't be as good.

Also there'a a fic where Harry came back to the past just a bit too late to save James and Lily so he raised Harry by himself. Along the way he also improved the magical world by cooperating with the Weasley twin, selling his "inventions" and introducing newer technology to the wizards. This fic is finished and has an unfinished sequel. Can't remember the name though, so if anyone knows it please help.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

**** Oh, PLEASE do--it's done in a really interesting way, I am ultra squicked by Snarry / Snarriet most of the time but The Never Ending Road is written so well, with rich characters and settings, and it isn't laser-focused on the couple to the exclusion of the rest of the universe the way many fics like that are. They don't even really get to any ~feelings~ portion until more than halfway into the thing, and it's NOT your typical swooning business. It's so realistic. The sequel is unfinished (and updating at excruciatingly slow speed) and I can spoil more if you are interested, but it's 100% not gross and 100000% charming thus far, I promise.

****** As of the latest chapter of the sequel, Snape has showcased, internally and externally, no feelings towards Harriet except for his commitment to safeguard her life. In fact once he becomes aware of her "crush" he is appropriately alarmed and disgusted.

So it's certainly safe to read in that regard. Plus, you know, this is the best fem!Harry fic of the fandom.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

*** Just started on Core Threads.. Mr. Granger's first name being Tom annoys me more than it probably should, but given the fact that the Big Bad is also named Tom, alongside the barkeep, i feel like it was a really dumb move overall, unless their shared name gets mentioned or it becomes a plot point or something.
