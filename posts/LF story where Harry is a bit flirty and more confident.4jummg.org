Title pretty much explains it but I dont want those fics where hes super cocky.


** I hope you like it, I spent 40 minutes with ever more exacting Google searches to find this. For some reason I didn't favorite it. Linkffn(harry potter and the other champion). If what you want is a harry who is more socially confident, this is your fic. Year four, harry is a lot more outgoing and has a lot more friends than in cannon, especially with the quidditch team. Btw, this is the epix search that brought it up as the first result: harry potter "fanfiction" yule ball katie bell angelina johnson quidditch friends sisterly

**** Thank you. I work night shift at a call center; I got paid while I googled for your fic on my phone (and helped old ladies reset their online passwords), so don't feel too bad. One thing I don't get a lot of at that job is gratitude, so I appreciate yours a lot.

Some suggestions here. I've read Living Siriusly and its alright. The Lie I've Lived is pretty fantastic as well and would recommend that.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway, yet miraculously he lives. Even so, the question of how remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

  I have a singularly impressive talent for messing up the plans of very powerful people - both good and evil. Somehow, I'm always just in the right place at exactly the wrong time. What can I say? It's a gift.

Both great, Return of the Marauders is one of my favorites. Very AU but an exceptionally fun story.

Is this getting any better after the first chapter? Harry and Sirius charging into the Great Hall on motocycles. Really? /Really?/

**** lol, probably not. It's no literary masterpiece but it's fun, the banter is appealing and the action is solid which is why I liked it. That and Harry isn't a super insecure, angsty, inexperienced child like a lot of fanfics. God, I'm so sick of all the angst.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

  James sacrificed himself to save his wife and son. Sirius took them into hiding and trained Harry the Marauders way. Neville became the BWL. That doesn't mean that he's the Chosen One. This is a AU story. Harry/Ginny MA Rating
