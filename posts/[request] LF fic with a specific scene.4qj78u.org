I read this fic a while back and I'm interested in reading it again. There's a scene I remember well where Harry hires a cursebreaking team which involves Bill Weasley, and when on a mission, Bill is struck by the Killing Curse. Part of the fic's canon included the Killing Curse's reputation of being truly unblockable coming from how it passed through physical objects as well as magical shields. Harry may or may not have time travelled. Thanks!

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.
