Looking for several different things with the Prophecy

1: Harry was told about the prophecy earlier then canon

2: The wording is different or the meaning behind the prophecy is different

3: Self Fulfilling prophecy: They don't do anything with the prophecy thinking if they do it will lead to self fulfillment.

Doesn't have to have all the things I mentioned, just one of them or something like it anyway.

Any ratings is fine, would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine. Am fine with Het/Slash/Femmeslash
