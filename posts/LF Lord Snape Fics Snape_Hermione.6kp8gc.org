I'm looking for any Snape/Hermione pairings fics where Snape is a wizard aristocrat or Lord Snape or what-have-you.

Thanks!


** I know I've read at least a couple of these but I can't remember the titles or authors. If you are not opposed to older fic your best bet is to seek out fics written pre-HBP and especially pre-OOTP. The ss/hg side of fandom was rife with rich and sophisticated pureblooded Snape back then.

** This isn't an exact match, but it was an SS/HG that I really enjoyed and have read multiple times. linkffn(For Hogwarts: A Regency Gamble)
