** Nah, they all to quickly stop being a parody and start being a circlejerk themselved.

** I think it would very quickly become people bullying others for fic requests. There's been issues in the subreddit with that in the past and they might just migrate to the circle jerk sub under the guise of 'can't you guys take a joke??'
