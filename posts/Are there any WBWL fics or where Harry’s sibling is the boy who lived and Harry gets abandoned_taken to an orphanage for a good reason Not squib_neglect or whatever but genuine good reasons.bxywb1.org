** There was one a long time ago where Harry's magic would lash out at anyone magical so he had to stay with the Dursley's until it settled. Don't remember anything else

*** I was struggling to come up with any logical reasons (other than evil, mind controlling Dumbledore or something) but that one actually makes sense.

*** No a WBWL or the sibling is the BWL. Either of them, I don't really care which. Basically I want a fic where Harry is sent away from the potters/his sibling for a reason that isn't straight up “he's the BWL so you don't matter”.

** Linkffn(The Perils Of Innocence) isn't WBWL but Harry is dropped off by the Dursleys because they don't want him any more and the staff take more care of him, when he does magic they don't know what's going on but try to find out.

#+begin_quote
  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.
