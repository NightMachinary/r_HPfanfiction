I can't remember all the details but this is what I remember:

Harry is sorted into Slytherin

When an older student (5th year?) challenges him about not being pureblood, he duels him and wins easily - so I think he knew about Magic already

This older student becomes a friend

The two of them, along with a couple others form a Slytherin Court - I think Snape mentions that this hasn't happened since Tom Riddle was there.

I'm pretty sure it's a Dark Harry

Think it was completed, but can't remember much else.


** Probably The Rise of a Dark Lord. Sadly abandoned .
