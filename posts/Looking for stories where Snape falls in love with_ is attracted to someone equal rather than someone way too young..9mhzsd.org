**** The ritual at the end of 4th year restores Voldemort's sanity as well as his body. He returns to his goals from before the horcruxes damaged his mind: to strengthen and preserve magical society. He realizes that the war had the opposite effect by severely thinning the population, so he completely changes his plans. He seeks a peaceful political path to power and encourages his servants to restore the population.

He exploits an ancient law to get absolved of his crimes so he can acquire the Slytherin Lordship. But before he can become Lord Slytherin, he must claim an heir who can speak parseltongue: Harry Potter. Drama ensues.

The fic is extremely dense and updates frequently. The story progresses from day to day without time skips and there's a heavy focus on pureblood politics/culture. Personally I think it's very well done, and it's one of my all-time favorites.

(The Snape romance is a side-plot that doesn't pop up until chapter 27.)

Her knowledge of potions is equal to Snape's, so they attend conferences together and use eachother as a sounding board. Later on in the story they conduct important experiments together.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.
