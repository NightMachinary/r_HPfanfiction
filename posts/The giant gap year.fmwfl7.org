After being expelled from Hogwarts Rubeus Hagrid is only fifteen so surely he doesn't get a job at Hogwarts right away. The story goes that he went tripping around the world and during this time he finds all these amazing creatures and Dumbledore lets him bring them back to Hogwarts.

The enchanted forest was once simply a bunch of trees and a few magical plants. When the acrumantula built a nest it was made forbidden. Hagrid filled it with every beast imaginable and ofered sanctuary to many soecies such as the centaur and Merfolk.

It would be very interesting to see how Hagrid came upon a three headed guard dog from hell or a giant squid and many other creatures to make an excellent story.

I can see Hagrid somehow accidentally finding himself rowing across the river Styx, and finding a fully grown Cerberus, and just treating it like a puppy. Showing no fear, he gains her trust and she allows him to adopt one of her pups.

That or he just takes one while being oblivious to her trying to stop him and he just thinks she's trying to play with him.
