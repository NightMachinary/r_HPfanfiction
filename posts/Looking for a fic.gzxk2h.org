:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Harry is Dracos twin, and was kidnapped one night when his parents went to some sort of party, i think. Tom Riddle is his godfather, and i think that ended up being the reason he couldnt kill him. Everyone thinks he was killed, but Narcissa. She states that she can feel him. Eventually he is beaten nearly to death by "his aunt and uncle" , and at that point Lucius can feel him as well. Im pretty sure it was slash with Harry and someone. I cant recall exactly who. Hos real family reacues him, but thats all i remember. Does that sound familiar to anyone?


** It sounds a bit like Blood Matters by BloodyRedQueen. Harry isn't Malfoy's twin but the rest of it seems to fit?
