I am currently in search of an adventure story of any sort. My only real requirements are that it is 15k+ words, shipping is not one of the main purposes of the story, and that it be complete. I'm not much a fan of bashing, but i know it is hard to avoid, at the least try to avoid Dumbledore bashing olif possible.


** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the forest of valbone) the main story arc is complete. I'm not sure if the fic is marked complete though.

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

** linkffn(6254783)

Rise of the wizards, one of the best fic I read. Dumbledore isn't really bashed (just misunderstood.)
