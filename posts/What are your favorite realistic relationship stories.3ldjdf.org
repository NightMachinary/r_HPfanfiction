A follow-up of sorts to the other romance thread. What fics have a well-written courtship/relationship? I hesitate to say romance because I want to include failed romances, unhealthy relationships, unconventional relationships, great friendships and so on. I want to see stories that go in-depth with a relationship, rather than merely existing to get two characters together.

For the sake of this thread, stories should heavily feature the relationship (i.e. not a minor subplot) and should not be smut. Sex scenes are fine, but the story shouldn't be about them.


** 'Realistic' can be mistaken for 'angsty trainwreck' if you put it like that.

linkffn(Number games by jbern) - actually a Ron-centric Quidditch story but there is enough background about how Hermione left him and he found Padma that it bears mentioning here.

*** I went back and omitted the part about ugly sides to put less focus on that; it's mostly about seeing some sort of conflict in the relationship. And oh god, angsty trainwrecks are the gritty=realism of romances.

The story wasn't my thing, but it does read better as a Quidditch story.

** The Jasmine/Merlin romance in A Long Journey Home is probably the best romance I've read in fanfiction. It's still a bit idealised/easy, but the characters at least feel real and independent of each other. Neither character feels parasitic on the other - so often in fanfic romances, one of the partners reads like their entire life exists simply as an offshoot of the other character's story. A Long Journey Home avoids that trap.

The romance subplots in The Merging are fun, but a bit of a guilty pleasure. The fun part is that Harry has so many potential partners and the fic is constantly teasing you as to which one he may end up with. It's the anti-OTP fic, but it's not a harem either. Harry's not dating multiple girls simultaneously, it's just that he's flirting with multiple girls and could end up dating any one of them, then it not work out and he ends up dating another, etc.

The guilty pleasure part is that it's just unbelievable that so many attractive girls are so entirely focused on Harry. None of them seem to care that Harry is transparently struggling to choose between them. In my experience, girls are not huge fans of the idea of being second choice. The fic also has the problem of the female characters not really being fully realised -- they tend to fall into the parasitic trap above, where their entire role in the story is as potential romance for Harry.

** I incline toward the older, unconventionally attractive, and damaged characters, which means the relationships are often flawed and morally ambiguous. I also like stories about marginal people finding ways to love and be loved, even if the arrangements they enter into look undesirable to outsiders. I suppose that might serve as a content warning for the following recs. I adore most of these stories, even if they're not beyond reproach on a stylistic level.

linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3860239]]) Harry is imprisoned by Voldemort, and Snape is assigned the night shift to guard him. Poetic, somewhat bleak, beautiful, ultimately hopeful.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2712814/1/So-Lonely-Without-Me]]) Harry and Snape are sequestered in a room alone, waiting for Dumbledore to summon them back. Time passes, and their relationship changes. Great banter, poignant undertones, compulsive reading. A persuasive if sympathetic Snape POV. One of the fics that sucked me into fandom.

linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1130477]]) Notable for the charm of the business partnership amongst the Trio and a compassionate rendering of the break-up of Harry and Ginny's marriage.

linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/495754]]) Forgotten, unwanted, overlooked people who create a fragile sort of relationship. Echoes of found family and slightly grotesque eroticism.

linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/500220]]) Charming and warm, a completely lovely slow development.

linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/317755]]) A brilliant, funny fic interspersed with painful moments and an upbeat ending. Young Professor Snape botches a spell and summons his five-year-old self into the present day. Filch the caretaker takes care of them both.

linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/865759]]) Wonderful, gradual, intelligent evolution of a relationship between a dandyish, scientifically minded professor with prosthetic limbs and a bereaved, taciturn young Snape. Still a WiP, with 12 installments so far.

linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1104139]]) Yes, you read the pairing right. This fic has magic, battles, high emotions, inventiveness, and tremendous heart. Neville's POV is perfect, and - well, this exemplifies the magic of fanfiction. The writer makes you /believe/ in an impossible relationship. A desert-island keeper for me.

We'll Take a Cup of Kindness Yet by dueltastic - [[http://hoggywartyxmas.livejournal.com/56425.html]] Aberforth Dumbledore/Minerva McGonagall/Severus Snape, 20K words. Witty, sharp, smart, and brusquely compassionate, with a fantastic Aberforth POV. Three pragmatic people managing an unexpected romance.

  #+begin_quote
    "Yeah?" said Aberforth. "What's Christmas ever done to you? Shat glitter in your cornflakes and made you wear the little paper hat in the cracker?"

Those are enough recs to be getting on with, I think.

  Snape swooped around the room like a giant bat, adding ingredients to some cauldrons and stirring others. Then he stopped and tapped his wand against the benchtop impatiently. "Well? What is so important that I must risk a vital brew of Animaserum by having you in the room with it?"His tongue was so dry, he didn't know how he would ever get the words out. "Heartsease, Professor." There, that wasn't so hard. He took a deep breath. Dementors were worse, surely.

      This is a prequel to Transfigurations, begun as a birthday present to Resonant, at least two birthdays ago\. Best laid plans, etc\. This departs from canon when Transfigurations does, after PoA, and I've tried to avoid using anything from the later books\. Massive thanks to Resonant, Cesca and particularly Mia, who fought for the story she believed in\.Please note: There's a quote at the start of the story, and it's there to serve as a gentle reminder for those who've read Transfigurations, and a warning for those who haven't\.

Arguably, for most of the story, you're not even supposed to be cheering for a relationship.

**** I've had a hard time finding good novel-length romances, because those tend to be the contrived ones. Or they're meant to be "ship fics" where the story is pretty much about the characters getting together. The better ones usually aren't strictly romance fics; maybe I'll loosen up the requirements for that.

The next one I'd rec (not strictly romance) is [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=327575][Devilish Delights, Wicked Ends]] is an ensemble political!Hogwarts story with Albus and an OC as the two kingpins at its center. It takes some chapters to get going with the plot, but it's very smartly-written with motivated, morally ambiguous characters. Funny and dark.

Also [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=313068][Run]] which I rec here a lot, has a great variety of relationships, from all eras (which is already cool, due to its world). The story itself is about the mystery surrounding the afterlife universe and its annual races.

Funny story actually -- four of us decided to all write Albus/OC novels because we hated the ship's tropes (he's the sweet golden boy, she's an awkward nobody--it's weird there were tropes with basically OCs, but there were and it made us gag. It was a really popular subgenre at the time), and we each spun it different ways (incidentally, each story is incredibly reflective of its author). Two are above (Devilish Delights is technically attempt #2). The other two are [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=311081][Welcome to Blunderland]] which has a wallflower OC, also addresses weird romcom tropes but in a more serious manner, and the whole thing turns out much darker and more bittersweet than you'd think. Mine is [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=295950][etc. etc. (and life goes on)]] which parodies fandom, mob mentality, and celebrity culture via an addictive, unhealthy relationship between the ice queen gossip reporter and an enigmatic Albus.
