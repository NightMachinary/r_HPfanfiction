*Spoilers*

For me it's a scene in Ginny Weasley and the Half-Blood Prince, where Snape has Ginny in detention after he has become headmaster. It starts out with some undertones of Snape seeing Lily in Ginny, and subconsciously wanting to protect her. This is fine, but then later in the scene he suddenly blurts out: "I WILL KEEP YOU SAFE, LILY!"\\
I found it to be very out of character for Snape to loose his cool and blurt out his secret like that. It's strange because pretty much every character in this fic is book accurate, even Snape every other time he appears.

A very weird lapse in book-accuracy and quality so far into this fic which is otherwise very good. Luckily, the moment is never mentioned again after, so it was easy to ignore it.


** I generaly hate any fic where people see Lily in Ginny. It has as much sense as saying that saying that all redheaded people look the same.

*** I never much understood that, either. Personally, I always pictured Ginny in my head as having bright orange-red hair (think the cliche 'ginger' hair colour), with a sporty, tomboyish bodytype; whereas with Lily I envisioned having darker, almost blood red hair, with a softer, more curvaceous body (think of a modest 'sexy librarian' build). Hell, my headcanon has Susan Bones more closely resembling Lily physically than Ginny ever did.

**** Sort of the other way around for me. Ginny being more sorta short and curved and Lily's tall and elegant. I agree on the hair tones, though. Also Ginny would probably have a shitton more freckles.

** Dignity in Fear has a sentence where the author inserts her view on body hair. And she uses Tonks of all people to do so (the one person who could probably get rid of all body hair within 3 seconds by simply thinking about it).

Of course there's also "Like Grains of Sand in the Hourglass", which biggest issue is the lack of the promised sequel.

  The story of "Harry Potter and the HBP", but told from the 3rd person POV of Ginny Weasley. Strictly in-canon. Suitable for anyone whom the "Harry Potter" novels themselves would be suitable for.

** Building on my recommendation of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/9r2ejd/you_can_only_recommend_one_fic_what_is_it_and_why/e8dlszf/][Out of the Night]] in the "Recommend One Fic" thread...

The fic's greatest weakness is that it fell a bit too in love with dark magic, to the point that it feels like a plot hole that dark wizards are the oppressed minority.

**** But who would write that book? There's not that many parselmouths.

Also, the whole "let's go to the chamber of secrets and get these old basilisk fangs" is so pointless when the diadem gets destroyed by fiendfyre. Should have just left that out and avoided the "Ron suddenly remembers a parseltongue word from 5 years ago" plot hole.

***** Well Harry could if he wanted some cash.

Also this is completely unrelated but listening the the Binge Mode podcast I began wondering why Harry didn't just buy Ron a new wand for himself back in second year. It's not like he was hard up for money.

Obviously Ron /needed/ a malfunctioning wand so Lockhart could fuck himself at the end of the book but man Harry drop some dimes on your friend.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12789035/1/The-Age-of-Lies][The Age of Lies]] is a lovely, funny, sad fic, and it's one of my favorites. But I think the author does scramble to wrap it up a little too nicely at the end. Sirius thought Remus was a spy, a traitor. I'm not sure friends/lovers could ever heal from that. To be fair, it's certainly not clear from the end that they *will* heal. But I posted the fic in this subreddit once, and someone responded saying that the author's kind of telling Sirius and Remus "now kiss" at the end. And that's somewhat true.

I still love it, though.

** In Mischief's Heir (which is my favorite fic/series ever), without being too spoilery, there is a big opportunity for the students. Ginny has done nothing to earn a position, not really, but she wants to go. In the story she likes Harry but Harry doesn't like her. Remus sees it as a sort of reverse James/Lilly and so lets her go... in the hope she'll have the chance to woo Harry I guess? Honestly it still bothers me every time I think of the series. Its not only completely unprofessional to let her go but its dismissive of Harry whose made it clear he isn't interested. Also, all the kids know Ginny going isn't for the best yet somehow Remus doesn't get this? But in the end it always goes back to the fact that she didn't deserve it for me. She shouldn't have been there and it just caused trouble in the end. I don't like the choice but I also don't buy Remus doing that. In other ways he's shown great respect for Harry and care for the project and yet in this case he lets it happen for... nostalgia?
