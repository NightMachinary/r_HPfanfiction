I see this all the time in fanfiction, and fan-media. Why is Sirius and Remus considered a couple? is a reason? or is it just another example of the community's odd tendencies?


** Because they want to. It's as simple as that. It's the same reason people ship Daphne Greengrass with Harry, despite the fact that she doesn't even have characterization within the books or movies.

** A few reasons.

1) reading the books, there are multiple scenes that imply a close connection- joint gifts, staring at each other for forty lines... Small things, but enough to cling to. Yes they were best friends, but Sirius was gone twelve years and prior to being locked up was convinced Remus was the traitor.

2) Thewlis played Remus as gay in PoA, at Cuaron's +request+ advice. Now, it's not obvious, obviously, since you can't exactly look at someone and know their sexuality, but it was something Thewlis used in his characterization of Remus. This helps explain the post-movie WolfStar stuff.

3) neither character had been mentioned in canon (that I can think of) of having a romantic past. We see girls eyeing Sirius in that memory in OoTP, but he doesn't pay attention to them. There's no mention of relationships regarding Remus until Tonks is interested.

4) it's such an old ship. There's some dating back to just after the book was released, which was like four years or so before the movie. That means it's had ~15 years of picking up traction, basically ever since the characters were first introduced.

5) there was never really anything to directly contradict it until Remus's biography on Pottermore last year or so. That biography said that Tonks was the first person Remus fell in love with, essentially making WolfStar non canon, when it was previously in that ambiguous grey area of possibilities.

6) people like representation. We see no homosexual or bisexual relationships within the pages of the books, so when we see a little hint of something, we kinda hope that maybe it is actually a little hope of something. There's been some works slowly popping up about Albus and Grindelwald, too, though that's less ambiguous than Remus/Sirius was.

7) it's an excuse to write about the Marauders, the first war, Lily and James, the original Order... We only have a bare bones outline, with a handful of memories and references to tie down events to a specific time. There's so much that we don't know. And depending on the reader/author, a romantic subplot when reading about a group of 15-17 year olds just kinda makes sense. It tends to be either Sirius/Remus or Sirius/Marlene from what I see most often.

8) it provides an entire genre of AUs- if Sirius didn't go to prison, he'd have possibly been able to raise Harry. There's a bunch of stories where R/S raise him.

9) from what we see of their personalities, and if you try and strip away a few layers of Sirius' mental health problems, they seem to rather complement each other, offset each other. Push that back twenty years when they were sarcastic pranksters, and it can make for a good drama depending on the author.

Edit: reread an article for verification and changed a word for accuracy :)

I don't understand why this is. If Rowling was heavily involved in the HP movies, did she know about and allow this? Or was this Cuaron just acting on his own? In the later books, Remus and Tonks get married, and obviously have sex, because Teddy is conceived and born. Tonks's Patronus even changes to a wolf (or werewolf) due to her deep love for Remus.

If Remus was gay, he probably wouldn't be even physically aroused by, or be capable of, having sex with Tonks to begin with. If he was bi, yes, but he wouldn't be able to if he was gay.

**** I believe it was done without Rowling's input, I haven't read anything definitive (I've read that it was Cuaron's artistic liberty, that Rowling didn't care, and that Rowling didn't know, all three different scenarios). What seems consistent was that Thewlis wasn't yet aware of the storyline involving Tonks, but that he adjusted his characterization once he knew about it.

The common idea after the whole Tonks thing was that Remus was bisexual. It's not like we could ignore blatant canon like that, and it was the easiest minor change to make both relationships work with the same man. (I know there are some R/T stories that will mention or joke about Remus having dated Sirius or having a thing for the Black family)

***** I'm not sure if adjusting the characterization would work, though. I think playing Remus as gay to begin with, especially when his sexuality was unknown and ambiguous, was a mistake. With Thewlis playing Remus as gay, but then later changing his playing of Remus to portray him as believably in love with Tonks [and therefore, /not/ gay], is problematic at best. For one, if Remus was gay, he wouldn't have fallen in love with (or had sex with) Tonks to begin with. It also has the implied message of [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CureYourGays][Cure Your Gays]], in which Remus is "cured of being gay" [or has his sexuality changed] when he "falls in love with a woman". That's a really bad message to send out. It would be one thing if Remus was an example of [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiTheWay][Bi the Way]], but instead, he was played as full-on gay.

Also, you can't even make the claim that he adjusted his characterization because the movies just fucked over Remus after the third movie. He barely had any screen time.

  Remus Lupin was supposed to be on the H.I.V. metaphor. It was someone who had been infected young, who suffered stigma, who had a fear of infecting others, who was terrified he would pass on his condition to his son. And it was a way of examining prejudice, unwarranted prejudice towards a group of people. And also, examining why people might become embittered when they're treated that unfairly.

***** Yes. However, anyone, not just gay men, can (and did) get AIDS. For example, in the play and movie /RENT/, in which most of the characters have HIV/AIDS, not all of them are gay. Some got infected by tainted needles and blood transfusions.

[[http://hivselftest.co.uk/blogs/news/37867781-hiv-its-not-just-about-gay-men][This article]] also does a fair job in debunking the perception that HIV/AIDS "is a gay disease".

Saying "Remus has lycanthropy, which is an HIV/AIDS metaphor, which means he must be gay" is a very big stretch due to this. A character having HIV/AIDS doesn't automatically mean he/she is homosexual or lesbian. There are actually more heterosexual people than gay people with HIV/AIDS in the UK, but there is a perception of HIV/AIDS as being "gay related" because gay people are more concerned and insist on protection, so as not to get infected. There is far more awareness and caution about HIV/AIDS in the gay community.

As for "condition", that could be metaphorical of any genetic defect or disease, such as Huntington's, Lou Gherig's, or Parkinson's.

******* I was more so referring to people in general, including Remus/Sirius shippers, who use the HIV/AIDS metaphor to claim that Remus is gay. Alfonso Cuaron also seems to have made that connection and assumption as well.

However, even in the books, Remus isn't gay. He canonically married, fell in love with, and had procreative sex with a woman. Rowling herself wrote this. She has voiced her lack of understanding and appalling reaction for people who didn't agree with her written interpretation of the books before, including decrying Draco Malfoy fans and Harry/Hermione 'shippers. Personally, I doubt that, if someone told her they saw Remus as gay, [edit] she wouldn't correct that fan as to his sexuality due Remus's relationship with Tonks.

There's no attraction to women there, much like most straight men would not be able to get an erection for another man. Gay men would not usually be able to get a erection and have sex with a woman [unless he took Viagra or something], much less fall in love with her. If some did, they probably have some bisexual leanings or tendencies, they just happen to be homoromantic, or decide that they prefer men over women.

Remus both fell in love with Tonks and married her, as well as had procreative sex with her, which is shows that he isn't really gay. Bisexual would probably be more likely.

No, I'm not. That's why I put "sexual attraction" in the first sentence. Gay men are, by definition, not attracted to women sexually. They do not want to have sex with women. Most gay men also do not fall in love with women.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Having an erection, and /keeping/ an erection, are two different things. Ask a gay man if he would actually be able to keep an erection if he had sex with a woman. The answer is probably "not very likely". Erections require more than just physical stimulus to keep going. Whether or not a gay man fantasizes about having sex with a man, the fact is that he will still be having sex with a woman, and that is a very hard thing to deny or "escape" when having sex.

#+begin_quote

There is a clear difference there, and these examples are not really relevant for two reasons.

- Prison rape is /rape/, not consensual sex, and is motivated and fueled by power. There is a clear power dynamic at play there, one that speaks more of disturbing tendencies, including sociopathic or psychopathic ones, and has nothing to do with sexuality.

- Most "gay for pay" actors [[http://www.villagevoice.com/blogs/gay-for-pay-porn-stars-speak-about-their-craft-nsfw-6381070][actually take Viagra or Caverject in order to physically complete gay porn]].

/Attraction and behavior are different things./

Attraction is a, but not the only, driver of sexual behavior. Social pressure is another, refer to the example you keep ignoring of how many closeted gay men have married and had children with women. They weren't delivered by the stork.

Also, many gay people have sex with members of the opposite sex before accepting that they are in fact gay. As a member of the LGBT community I've heard this story many times. Sometimes they couldn't complete the act, but often they could though it was unfulfilling in a way that reinforced their lack of attraction.

I said nothing about rape. If you think that every sexual encounter that occurs in prison is rape... I don't really know what to say about that. Though this also illustrates another driver of sexual behavior that's independent of attraction.

Generally, if you disagree with someone, it's a /faux pas/ to focus on the person instead of the argument. You not agreeing with me doesn't make my perspective or opinion wrong. Instead, the debate should be focused on facts. Sexuality is a very fluid, varied, and highly personal experience for different people, and here, I think it's come down to areas which are still hotly debated.

I think the root of the disagreement here is that, ultimately, our opinions are different. That doesn't make either of us right or wrong, we just have different perspectives. Using personal experience or an isolated example, unfortunately, is not really a valid argument on either side to make a solid, fact-based claim, by any person, in any circumstance.

**** To be honest, its possible that as Potter was getting really big (after GoF) and becoming a huge teen international franchise, Rowling's editor pushed her into pairing up Remus andTonks, two heavily queer-coded characters (lack of previous opposite-sex SOs, Tonks' tomboyish tendencies and short hair and job as the only female detective Auror, and Remus' past closeness with Sirius and no woman, gentleness, being good with kids and the werewolf-AIDS metaphor thing). It's awfully convenient that /both/ these characters become spontaneously into each other despite the huge age difference, and that the 'cool', independent Tonks who Ginny idolizes immediately decides to step off the front lines and be a mother (why wasn't she still strategizing at meetings, for example?).

Pre-canon. We don't see them - Tonks is the only girl on the adult 'team' as such - besides parents, etc., in the core cast - Sirius, Remus, Kingsley, Moody, Mundungus, the Weasleys and Tonks, are the characters that we see in and out of Grimmauld in OOTP and HBP.

Yes, she gets pregnant. But she didn't have to right away. It doesn't square with the go-getter character who loves her job introduced in OOTP to immediately give up her job and decide to have kids right away, especially at such a young age.

#+begin_quote
  What meetings do we see her in?
#+end_quote

My point exactly. She's in and out of Order HQ, having meals round the table and sitting in at strategy meetings afterwards during OOTP - as Harry, Ron and Hermione get cross when they're excluded - but after she falls pregnant, she just withdraws from everything and barely gets a line in.

And if she was so invested in becoming a mother and putting her child first, then why does she come running back to the battle as soon as she's given birth, when she's probably still weak? It doesn't add up, necessarily.

Anyway this isn't meant to be a tract about Tonks' motivations. I've been in this fandom for a long time and to people around the time OOTP/HBP books were released, it was a big surprise when Tonks and Remus were paired up out of the blue and Tonks stepped out of the story. It was a surprise after how different from all the other adult women she had been when introduced that she would go on to follow the same arc as Lily (and Alice, I guess). Especially as all of the aforementioned witches are described as very talented magically, each with unique skills, and very motivated to give their all for the war effort.

But I get that younger people in the fandom or people who've consumed the books and movies at the same time might read Remus and Tonks differently. There was a lot more wild speculation and fanon was almost stronger, or more widely accepted in the /whole/ fandom, not just in certain sections, before there was as much canon released.

#+end_quote

None of these things indicated that either Remus or Tonks were queer or gay. Nor were there any "heavy" signs of them being queer.

- Lack of shown sexual partners or unknown sexuality doesn't mean one is queer. Celibacy or focusing on one's career over pursuit of a love life is completely different from being gay, queer, or asexual.

- "Tomboyish" girls and women aren't always queer. Being a tomboy is not a sign of being queer, either.

- Hairstyle and career having nothing to do with being queer.

- Remus and Sirius were close as friends, and Remus was also close friends with James Potter and Peter Pettigrew. There is no clear evidence that either Remus or Sirius were homosexual, and Sirius is also shown as having pictures of scantily-clad women (but no men) in his bedroom later in the series.

- Again, gentleness and being good with kids have nothing to do with being gay.

A lot of what you mentioned also seems to play into queer stereotypes, particularly of Tonks being queer.

#+end_quote

Having HIV/AIDS doesn't make one gay. In the UK, only 46% of people with HIV/AIDS are gay. The other 54% are heterosexual. I posted an article in another reply where the author debunked the misconception that HIV/AIDS is a "gay disease", or predominantly affects gay people. (It doesn't. It affects everyone.)

Not all werewolves in the series are gay, either. Greyback has pedophilic undertones, and also expressed a sexual interest in Hermione in DH. Lycanthropy could really be a metaphor for /any/ disease of condition that is possible to pass to one's partner or children, not just HIV/AIDS.

I've loved wolfstar for the longest time due to the fact the world around them can be so enriched and different from harrys world. It allows so much room for creativity and I love having added onto my internal idea of what the harry potter universe is like. Ive read most majors ones of course.

** Of all things, it should have been Sirius/James, since Sirius and James were the "best, best" friends and they were always closet to each other...but then, James had Lily, so Sirius was left with Lupin who also had a close connection to him regardless. And many scenes (especially) in PoA can definitely add fuel to this fire.

They're definitely not gay, but of course their relationship makes it easy to imagine them so!

Bisexuality is also a thing, of course, and canon supports their bisexuality about as well as it supports Dumbledore's homosexuality.

I can just imagine Sirius teasing Remus about how distracted he was around Tonks, and Remus replying that only Sirius could make him go starry-eyed.

***** Thing is, Dumbledore is apparently gay despite there being nothing in the pages to say so (Rowling revealed he was in response to a fan question, not within the books). Therefore, it stands to reason that nothing being written in the pages doesn't prevent someone from having a non-straight sexuality.

*** CLEARLY Sirius and James would both be tops, so that could never work ;)

Plus closeness of a friendship and sexual chemistry are just two different things. There's just a /something/ between Sirius and Remus, and it's easy to take that and run with it.

As for sexual orientation, read up on the Kinsey scale- bisexuals aren't strictly equally into both sexes, a person can also legitimately be "mostly gay" or "mostly straight"- maybe they are almost always attracted to men, but once in a while there's a woman that really gets them going :)

this in itself would make the relationship unhealthy. he rather be visibly upset and do nothing than hold them accountable. if they can't communicate for remus's fear of rejection, that's...not good. he obviously chooses to stand by than hold sirius accountable for his actions a lot, and that's not a good dynamic at all.

james and sirius being in a relationship with any marauder that isn't james or sirius is unhealthy, tbh

*** Well they were at the height of the war, there was an unknown mole in the Order, and it seems like a lot of fan works try to explain this. (Remus may have succumbed to the belief that Sirius ended up like the rest of his family, while Sirius may have succumbed to the belief that werewolves in the end are dark creatures.) I don't /think/ the actual reasons for them suspecting each other was actually explained, but when you're afraid you can make interesting judgments. Didn't make it right, though.
