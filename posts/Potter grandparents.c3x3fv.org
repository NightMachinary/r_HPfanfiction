** The Reclamation of Black Magic linkffn(12058516)

Where '...the power he knows not...' is a pissed off grandmother. Unfortunately not complete.

Stepping Back linkffn(12317784)

The Potter's are pretty prominent here. After going back in time, Harry is assumed to be James at a glance and his parents are called.

  Harry Potter's family isn't only at Number 4 Privet Drive. Unaware to even Dumbledore, an upheaval is approaching. The Ancient and Noble House of Black is reclaiming their power and changing the future of the magical world. *Updated Sporadically---Not Abandoned*

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

  During the battle in the Department of Mysteries things go very wrong. An errant spell changes things far more than anyone could've imagined. Despite the title, this is NOT a Dr. Who crossover fic.

** linkffn(12155794) ... I am not big fan of the final (although objectively, it is an excellent battle), and I hate Harry-meets-his-ancestors-and-throws-all-his-previous-friends-out-of-window trope, but especially parts involving Charlus Potter are good.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

** Broken Reflections by Jacob Apples is an awesome time travel where Harry ends up back in time after 5th year and everyone assumes he's probably James's bastard brother and the Potters are confused but welcome him into their home nonetheless. It's incomplete, but there's enough in there to be worth the read regardless and the author does finish stories, he just switches which one he's regularly updating every few months so it takes awhile.

Wind Shear by Chilord has Charlus Potter as one of the major characters, but he's Harry's great uncle in this instead of his grandfather.

  Harry remembers the mirror Sirius gave him in the fifth book and realizes Voldemort is in his mind. Fed up with his circumstances he takes matters into his own and hands with an unforeseen fallout. Marauders age, No time Paradox. Hedwig Forever.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
