I'm mainly wondering about those who would have had a predisposed notion that Harry is the wizarding world's hero.

These people being Dumbledore, McGonnagal, Sirius, Lupin, Ministry, Press, former Death Eaters, etc.

This could also include children who grew up hearing tales about the fall of Voldemort, especially the Weasley kids.

Will they blame themselves? Think it's their fault he turned bad? Will they hesitate to fight him? Will they try talking him to their side or will they treat him just like any other dark wizard? Will the Death Eaters accept him/trust him?

I'll gladly take fanfic suggestions with this premise in mind.


** It depends on when Harry turned evil. Given the crap all of them went through in canon, a Harry turning evil and radical after the War would find plenty of loyal followers, such as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167).

Of course, there is the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Hocrux]], linkffn(10677106), in which he's evil right from the start. But he hides well and thrives in the chaos he created.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

** I think Hermione has a much higher potential for turning evil. While she is against breaking rules just for the sake of breaking rules, she has no problem doing so for a good reason, like setting Snape on fire to save Harry. She's a genius with a lot of potential, she can be really scary when she gets angry, she's ruthless against traitors (cursed DA contract) and she is rejected from society because of bigotry.

Harry grew up in a bad situation and the magical world is a massive improvement over the Dursleys. He's unlikely to want to destroy it. Hermione in the other hand grew up in a good situation in the muggle world and is met by massive bigotry in the magical world. I can see her recruiting other muggleborns to overthrow the ruling pureblood elite.

Attempting to overthrow the government and killing important pillars of society like Malfoy would make her just as evil as Voldemort in the eyes of many, but if she succeeds and installs a democracy instead of the antiquated hereditary system she'd be the greatest hero ever. History is written by the victors after all...

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.
