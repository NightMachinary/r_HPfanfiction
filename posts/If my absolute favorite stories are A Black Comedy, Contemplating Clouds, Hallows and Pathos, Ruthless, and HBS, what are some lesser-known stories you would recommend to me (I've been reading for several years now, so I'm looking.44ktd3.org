I'll add this: any rating is fine and most pairings are fine, just no HPDM, HPLV/HPTM, HPSS. I prefer HP focused stories, but not required.


** /Hallows and Pathos/? Coolness--glad you liked it!

I suspect you've read these, but linkffn(By the Divining Light by enembee) and linkffn(Conlaodh's Song by enembee) are outstanding.

A few other, more obscure stories that I think are worth checking out: linkffn(Simple and Clean by Digifruit), linkffn(What lies beneath by Master Slytherin), linkffn(The Human Condition by C. K. Talos), linkffn(Harry and the Hobgoblins by Respitechristopher) (because you like Contemplating Clouds).

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.
