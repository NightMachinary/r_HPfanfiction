It was on Schnoogle or one of the other sites like that. There were three "books" and a epilogue book. The premise was Voldemort as a father figure to Harry. It worked and Harry eventually saw Voldemort as a father. The epilogue book had Voldemort come back as a ghost and take over Harry's body I think?

** Speaking of schnoogle, is that site still being maintained?

​

By that I mean are stories still being uploaded to it?

​

There use to be some pretty good stories on that site.
