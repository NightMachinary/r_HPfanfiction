I started a hp/sword of Truth crossover here [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9900528/45/An-Anthology-on-Broken-Pottery]] and I'm looking for more like that. I'd especially like to see some harry/kahlan sot/hp crossovers if you know of one like mine.

Other examples would be castle: He's the plucky comic relief sidekick to beckett, merlin where he's the sidekick to the once and future king, or in thor where he's the hero but we see him through jane's eyes more than we see Midgard through thor's.

If you link femslash or slash, please add that in your reply. I don't care to read slash but i know others do. Thanks.


** I'm actually writing a fic where Harry is the surprise third crossover element. He's a supporting character mostly moving behind the scenes and giving advice to the protagonist.

It's a challenge because I want to give enough clues so people aren't like 'WTF is the author thinking just revealing this character as Harry Fucking Potter out of nowhere?' but I also don't want to make it obvious. Ideally, they wouldn't guess it, but after the reveal they'll remember the clues and think it makes sense.

If you'd like I could link you the story in a PM (it's tiny right now, as a heads up). I could actually use someone looking over this aspect of the story in particular.
