:END:
Harry potter fanfiction where there is a huge war and muggle tech and muggle people are involved and they launched a bunch of nukes from space I think and almost destroyed the earth. Hermione bashing. I think there is something about Harry being a Supreme Chancellor and I think that the epilogue or last chapter has something about having statues or being a saviour.

I have been searching for a while and can't find it Help pls. IDC what website it is but I found it in ffn
