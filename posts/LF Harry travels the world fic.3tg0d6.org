fics where harry travels the world post DH no slash...please. crossovers are fine.... i think. thanks for your time ^{^}


** DH never happens, but it takes place before and after the end of Voldemort, and is complete crack. Harry becomes the mysterious insanely lucky Mister Black traveling the world where deatheaters and evil people in general have unfortunate accidents, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish][Make a wish (1)]] - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3032621/1/The-Hunt-For-Harry-Potter][The Hunt for Harry Potter (2)]] and, by a different author but still pretty good, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9510186/1/Terminal-Justice][Terminal Justice (3)]], in which, shortly before the end of book 1 (just pretend the later chapters and second book didn't happen), Harry (Mister Black) gets sent to Justice Leagues universe.

There's a fanfic full of omakes of the series by the original author, but it's not worth reading IMO.

--------------

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2354771/1/Where-in-the-World-is-Harry-Potter][Where in the world is harry potter]], part one of 3, post voldy's death harry takes a /very/ long trip everywhere and anywhere, humor and crack abound.

--------------

If I recall right, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4442117/1/My-Name-is-Cameron-Sage][My Name Is cameronSage]], a fic in which Harry goes back in time, takes up a new name, and does a good bit of travel as well- and attends a magic university of sorts as well. It's Harry/Snape, but I dislike most slash myself and still found the fic, not great but decent and the slash/romance wasn't /too/ intrusive for me to ignore.

--------------

And finally, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4133028/1/The-Birth-of-Evil][The birth of evil]], though I found Harry not so much evil- no more than anyone else that starts a war anyway, and a war against incompetence and corruption is one that I have no problems with really. The fic is short and covers all 7 years, and only a handful of words are spent on Harry's travels, but I find it pretty interesting where he plans on going and why. Should definitely be expanded into a full fic- it's extremely short.
