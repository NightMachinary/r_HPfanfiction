So time travel fics are the bread and butter of this fandom. I like some of them, but they're ultimately all the same premise: Someone time travels and then they have to preserve history or whatever, culminating in voldemort dying.

So what if that were different? Say, Harry is sent back to the past, to fix it. Only immediately, things start being different - at first it's simply things happening differently than he remembers, seemingly conspiring against his efforts to change the outcome, and eventually, he starts seeing strange people sniffing around the wizarding world, seemingly searching for him. He overhears something about an "anomaly", and the story goes from there.

Essentially, a fic where Harry's time travel does not go unpunished - instead, timecops from the future show up to eliminate him and prevent the destruction of their own timeline. This could even spiral out of control with a rival faction of timecops fighting the first, this one supporting Harry's bid to change the past because their timeline resulted from his alterations.


** Possible Doctor Who crossover with Time Lords looking for whoever messed with the Time stream

** Good prompt. I've often thought a HP/Star Trek crossover where some Starfleet officers (Captain Braxton?) show up and accuse Harry of breaking the Temporal Prime Directive would be amusing.

** and a third rebel faction made from his children that try to change the timeline only enough for their father to survive his untimely demise in their future

â€‹

All this is narrated by a fourth neutral party, that was sent by the surviving death eater faction to directly kill harry potter, but decided that they didn't pay him enough to get involved in that kind of timey-wimey crap.

*** Plot twist, all the different factions of time travelers are all descendants of Harry's, just from different timelines.

**** x2 plot twist combo! One of the time travelers actually comes from the future of an alternate universe, so they try to do extremely radical changes to force a future that would have never happened.

*** That first one I've seen in a fic, though saying /which/ fic would spoil one of the major mysteries of the first fic in a three-part series.
