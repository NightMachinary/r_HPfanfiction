It has been a good while since I posted on Reddit, but I just really need to recommend this fanfiction to someone. It's called The Changeling by Annerb. It was just completed not too long ago (2017) and it is by far the best fanfiction I have ever read. It follows the story of Ginny Weasley from her first year to the end of the war, however she was sorted into Slytherin. It is a very interesting concept, and after watching the SuperCarlinBrothers' video about Ginny being a Slytherin, it kind of makes sense that she would be sorted in that house. This fanfic is filled with amazing themes and messages and is a very well written and well paced story. It made me understand and appreciate the Slytherin house (and Ginny) more. So yeah, that's my tangent. Go check it out:)

** That's a very popular one. And I've read it-it's very good. I'm not sure if I want to read the sequels though. I like Ginny a LOT esp in this story but if there's a lot of Hinny I dunno if I want to read.

****** Yeah, even if you don't like Hinny I think it's worth it. It's the most realistic way I've seen any author, even outside of fanfic, deal with a teenage relationship, and it also has a good take on a post-war Britain. Plus, my phone buzzed with stay at home orders an hour ago, so you may have the time haha

******* What's particularly realistic about it? I've only read some of the stories in the series and I'm not sure what you are referring to.

I've always thought that a lot of fiction makes relationships overly complicated and dramatic. Most real life relationships are very straightforward honestly. Humans aren't that complicated when it comes to romance and sex. Especially teenagers.

******** That was my thing, it wasn't dramatic. I mean, there was the one classic “I'm putting sunscreen on her my god” scene but other than that, I felt it was more about letting them work out how to be together in a non-cliche way. Same went for Ron and Hermione. I also thought the author handled sex scenes really well and liked that the characters discussed stuff like birth control beforehand with older, maternal figures. So basically, I totally agree most fics can over-complicate relationships (they're teenagers not soap operas) and felt this fic handled it differently.

Spoilers ahead: I thought it was extremely well written and gripping, but the content was almost too much for my poor heart at times. The idea of a young Ginny being tattooed against her consent almost made me physically ill. I almost couldn't keep reading just because of that

In this fanfic it was obvious that most of the Slytherin students weren't any more evil than the other houses.

** If you want someone to gush over how amazing this fic is, hit me up!! I adored it so much I immediately reread it after finishing it. The sequels are good IF you're into Hinny. I personally find Harry incredibly dull so no matter how well written it was, I just couldn't stick with it. That being said, it takes a long ass while for them to get together, and that sweet spot of time before Harry features regularly is as good as the first part. In fact, it's so well written that I enjoyed reading Harry's POV up until he and Ginny get together (sorry to Hinny fans out there, I just find them mind boggling boring together).

*** Yes 100%. This is more of a Ginny fanfic than anything. The hinny stuff doesn't start till the very end, but unlike the books, it's a more slower/realistic development of their relationship and it's not too heavy. Since Ginny is a Slytherin in this fic, she doesn't really see Harry that much anyway. It's more focused on her life and how her character develops as she comes to understand the meaning of being a Slytherin.

I would highly recommend reading it though, since the second sequel covers Ginny's last year in Hogwarts, so you will find all of those things that made the changeling great, without too much focus on Ginny's and Harry's relationship.

It's good for challenging preconceptions about Slytherin, I suppose. And it was good to see some of Slytherin actually help in the final battle; JKR really did them a disservice in canon by making every single one of them sit out.
