**** I'm not 100% sure about this, but I do think might have read this on SIYE, you might try searching there. But again, not sure at all about that.

I'm sorry to say that I don't remember the title.

*** They wipe him out and start him over. He starts Hogwarts a year late and is friends with Ginny. His identity is a secret until someone outs him.

Reminds me of /Babylon 5's/ [[http://babylon5.wikia.com/wiki/Mindwipe][death of personality.]]
