Like the title says. The survey on this subreddit suggested that a lot more people write hp fanfic than actually publish. If you're one of those people, or just a shy writer in general, I would love to see any piece that's lingering on your computer/phone/docs/whatever, even if it isn't completed, no matter how small or unpolished. If you'd like to share your aspirations for the piece, I'd love to hear it too!


** OK but in all seriousness here's some of what I've posted here in response to prompts:

“Tha's for Aragog, ya right bastard!”

Harry and Tom whirled in shock.

There stood Rubeus Hagrid with a giant rooster in one hand, and brandishing his pink umbrella in the other.

“How-“ said both Harry and Tom at the same time.

“The trick is, you need ta know ‘ow ta calm ‘im. If ya can't calm ‘im,” he turned his beetle black, normally gentle eyes, but now, hard as obsidian onto the specter of Riddle, “Yeh've got to know ‘ow to kill ‘im.”

In sheer frustration, Harry jabbed his wand at the door blocking their way, “Confri-“

Harry started down at his suddenly empty hand, and looked up to see Dumbledore holding it gingerly between two fingers, an alarmed expression fading.

"Are you privy with the intricacies of the Blasting Curse's functioning coupled with enchantment, Harry?" Dumbledore finally asked in a mild tone.

“No,” he said, somewhat mulishly.

“Then I'd advise against casting rashly,” said Dumbledore, holding the wand out to Harry. “The enchantments on this door would cause some spectacular fireworks, should it be hit with such a curse, the kind that would result in an extended stay in St. Mungo's, given our immediate vicinity.”

Harry took on a slightly shamefaced expression. “Thank you for stopping me, Professor. I already filled my quota for Hospital Wing visits this year thanks to a mishap in Snape's-“

“Professor Snape's”

“Professor Snape's classroom.” Harry's expression turned mulish again at the correction.

"Ron? What are you doing?" Hermione asked.\\
"Googling," said Ron.\\
"What are you even Goo- MERLIN!"\\
"Hermione!" Ron said, hiding the screen.\\
Hermione stared at the barely hidden screen with wide eyes, her mouth moving soundlessly for a few moments, alternately going quite pale and blushing. She tilted her head... "How is he even... NO! Ron! You're too young to be looking at those sites. I'm too young to be looking at those sites!"\\
"MR. WEASLEY!" the professor shouted from behind them both, causing both Hermione and Ron to jump, startled.\\
The youngest Weasley son went as red as his hair as he frantically attempted to close the window while covering the screen so Hermione couldn't see more, finally accidentally sending the screen crashing to the floor. "Oops."

**** The thing is, I imagine him being magically powerful but the opposite of Dumbledore. Dumbledore is wise, powerful, and uses magic with finesse.

Hagrid presents a simple exterior, but he is wise in his own way, powerful, and uses magic with strength. He is the type of wizard who could use fiendfyre without much trouble simply because he's powerful enough to wrestle it into submission, on a magical level.

** I guess.

​

He came to the end of the corridor to face a familiar looking portrait. It was of the same stern man whose statue was holding the portkey that brought him here in the first place. Beneath the portrait was a name: Osmund Pickley.

‘Must be the guy in charge.'

The portrait saw him approach, face growing more severe the closer he came.

“What's this then? Some penniless vagabond?” he snapped out. “An ignorant vagrant? Have your senses left you boy? Speak up!”

“Harry Potter. I received an invitation from Luna Lovegood. Have you seen her?”

“Is that so?” The man questioned before rising, leaving Harry's sight for a few seconds before reappearing with a familiar card in hand. The man turned Harry's invitation over in his hand before setting it down.

“Harry Potter was it? Any relation to Fleamont Potter, perchance?”

“My grandfather.” Harry answered. “Passed away before I was born, sadly.” He added, to forestall any questions and catching-ups the portrait may have for a man Harry never had the chance to know.

The man frowned slightly. “I see. Well no matter. Let us begin the preliminary examination.”

A circle of light appeared beneath Harry's feet.

The man pulled a sheet of paper from somewhere, as well as a pair of reading glasses. “This will be a simple process. Just answer the following questions as truthfully as you can.”

‘For the love of...' “Can you just tell me where Luna is? She's been missing for a while now.”

“Don't interrupt!” he snapped, glaring at Harry from over the top of sheet of paper. “We'll discuss Miss Lovegood when I've decided you can be allowed in!”

Harry glared mulishly at the portrait but held his tongue. He wasn't here to argue with pictures after all, and the quicker he got this over with the quicker he could find Luna.

Satisfied at his silence, the portrait nodded to himself. “Now then. First question; full name?”

“Harry James Potter.”

“Current occupation?”

“Auror.”

“Hmm. Age?”

Harry rolled his eyes. “Really?”

“Answer the question.”

“20.”

“Hmm, awfully young, but that's not a bad thing, necessarily.” The man mused to himself. “Where were you schooled in magic?”

“Hogwarts.”

“Yes, of course. Strongest subjects?”

“Is this really necessary?”

“Yes! I need to determine if you'll be a valuable and productive member of my city! I'll not put up with some worthless layabout looking for handouts! Now answer the questions and stop interrupting!”

“Defense against the Dark Arts.”

“Just Defense?”

“I got Exceedings on most other subjects; Transfiguration, Charms, Potions, Herbology, that stuff. Divination and History were the only subjects I didn't do so well in.”

“Ah, that's a fair number of NEWTs.”

Harry rolled his eyes. “Sure.” He bit out, not at all interesting in explaining the fact that he had no NEWTs, thanks to certain prophecy and nigh immortal Dark Lord.

The circle under him flashed red, and a searing pain lanced through his hand. Harry looked to find the book symbol on his hand had darkened. “What?”

“You lied.” The portrait answered frostily, a fierce scowl on his face as he leered at Harry. “Why?”

‘Here we go.' Harry thought as he braced himself for an argument he'd heard many a time for Hermione and Mrs. Weasley both. “I don't actually have NEWTs. I had to drop out of my seventh year.”

“You're a dropout?!” The man yelled, scandalized. “I' won't have a dropout in my city!”

“I had to! There was a Dark Lord trying to kill me!” Harry retorted, burning at the thought that even dead Voldemort was wasting his time, and mystified at actually having to explain Voldemort to another, which was an experience he can't recall ever having. “And after we defeated him there was too much work to be done! There hasn't been any time until lately, and by now it hardly matters, does it?”

“Oh." the man said simply, calm in heartbeat. His eyes wandered back to the paper in his hands. "Well you should have just said so. Now you'll have a mark on your record for lying to a government official.”

Harry couldn't decide if he should curse his luck that another government official was tormenting him for ‘lying', question the ridiculousness that a portrait was a government official to begin with, or question him about this lie detecting circle he wandered into, so he simply settled for silence to get this over with.

“Now then, let's continue. Any outstanding debts?”

Harry swallowed a sigh. “None that I know of.”

“Any enemies of note?”

Harry rolled his eyes. “I'm an auror.”

“Ah.” The man looked sheepish for a moment as he recognized the broadness of his question. “Allow me to clarify. Are there any bitter rivals, debt collectors, mortal enemies, spurned lovers, husbands to any paramours, dark lords, or anything to that effect that would track you down and murder you for reasons unrelated to your occupation?”

“To the best of my knowledge, no.” Voldemort and his more fanatical followers were long dead or imprisoned, and no one has stepped up to claim Tom Riddle's former crown since. The closest thing to a rival he could ever claim was Malfoy, and they buried the hatchet long ago. He certainly hadn't slept with anyone's wife, and Ginny and he were...

Well he wasn't sure what they were, but regardless of that they were still friends at the very least. They certainly weren't spurned anything, even if they might not be lovers at the moment.

“Very good, very good. Are you suffering from any noticeable and otherwise incurable diseases, ailments, or afflictions that would render you a burden on society?”

“Other than poor eye sight,” he tapped his glasses for emphasis, “None to my knowledge.”

“Splendid. Now lastly, do you have any contraband or illicit materials on your person at this moment?”

‘Shit.' “What's considered contraband?”

A sheet of paper appeared in front of him. Harry took it in hand and gave it a look over, and immediately felt his eyes strain at trying to read the tiny font.

‘This is a list Filch would approve of in a heartbeat.'

Joke Items of any kind, muggle weaponry of any kind, any magical beast with a danger rating of XX or higher, any and all poisons, any and all recreational drugs, at least thirty different potions, including Polyjuice and Felix Flicius, nearly every plant he remembered potting in Hogwarts, it went on and on. Harry look over the list three times, just to be sure. “Nope, nothing on this list.”

“Perfect!” He exclaimed, enthusiastic for the first time. “You'll do nicely, yes you will. Consider yourself approved for entry on a level two basis.”

The man in the portrait stamped Harry's invitation, which disappeared and reappeared in front of Harry. Harry took the card and the list of contraband and slid them into his breast pocket.

“Now, do you have any questions?”

‘Finally.' “Where is Luna Lovegood?”

“Luna? She's perfectly safe, perfectly sound. You'll find her in one of our research facilities. Wonderful girl, following in her mother's footsteps like that.”

Harry felt a jolt of shock and ice flood through him. “What?”

“Oh yes. Pandora loved her experiments, could hardly tear herself away from them once she got started. She was,”

“Extraordinary.” Harry whispered.

This shocked the portrait. “Why, yes. That's quite right.”

/‘She was a quite extraordinary witch, you know, but she did like to experiment and one of her spells went rather badly wrong one day.'/

*** The basic idea was Bioshock but Harry Potter. A gifted wizard didn't like the wizarding world as he saw it and tried to make his own city, only for things to go drastically wrong. I wanted both a Harry Potter fic that had nothing to do with Voldemort directly, and to give Luna some focus, so I thought to do it myself. So Luna disappears for a few months with no word to anyone, and Harry tracks her down to a lighthouse in the middle of a jungle.

** I've got an idea for a fic where Sirius gets badly injured (I'm thinking of taking his magic away) instead of killed. I have no plan for it whatsoever, and all I've written so far is the below. I don't even have a title for it yet. It'll probably be several months or years before I even finish the first chapter.

.

Everything seemed to freeze as the red jet of light soared past Sirius' outstretched arm and hit him squarely on the chest. Sirius' eyes widened, the ghost of his laugh still etched on his face, and he toppled backwards -- into the veil.

Harry, who had abandoned his opponent to watch, broke out of his stupor -- he had to do something. So he pointed his wand at Sirius and cast the first curse that came to mind as he ran towards him, hoping to stop his fall, because, while he didn't know what the veil was, he knew that it was dangerous in some way.

'Expelliarmus!'

His spell collided with Sirius' head and threw him against the far wall with a sickening crunch, where he slid down and stayed there, no doubt unconscious. Harry screamed and tripped, but continued running --- at least until Lupin caught him around the waist and said, his face contorted in pain, 'Harry, you can't help him.'

'Yes -- I -- can!' Harry bit out as he struggled against Lupin's firm grip, stronger than a normal human's because of his affliction, no doubt.

'Harry, you can't, because he's d--'

'He -- isn't -- dead! He just hit the wall, he's just unconscious!'

'Bellatrix hit him with a dark curse, you really think she would have gone for anything less than lethal?'

Lupin seemed to be trying to convince himself of Sirius' death for whatever reason, but Harry was having none of it.

'I DON'T CARE, LET ME SEE MY GODFATHER!' he roared and broke free. As he neared Sirius' crumpled body, his body went cold at the realisation that this was his fault. He had hit Sirius with the Disarming Spell, he was the reason Sirius had come here --- heck, he was the reason this whole battle had even happened! And now Sirius and countless others were paying for his stupidity.

Harry fell to his knees and turned Sirius over with shaking hands. His godfather's face was deceptively peaceful, as though he hadn't just been knocked out by a dark curse and an Expelliarmus. He reached out and searched for a pulse hastily, almost crying in relief when he found it, faint though it was.

'Professor! He's alive! Help, I think he's injured---'

'You think?' Lupin asked sarcastically before rushing over and performing a series of complicated waves with his wand. Harry crouched by his side, wringing his hands frantically.

'What can I do? I need to help---'

'What you can do is stop distracting me. Go fight some Death Eaters, make sure I don't get hit while I'm trying to fix him.'

Harry was surprised at the venom in Lupin's voice. Did the man blame him for what had happened? If so, then he'd understand perfectly as he blamed himself as well. If only he hadn't been so stupid...

Deciding that now was not the time for self-pity, Harry stood up and looked around the room, searching for an opponent. Encouraged by what had happened to Sirius, the Order members fought viciously, and the Death Eaters were falling in numbers quickly. Soon, they were outnumbered, all while Harry stood there and watched uncertainly.

A giggle had Harry turning to look at the exit, and he snarled furiously when he saw that it was Bellatrix, who seemed to be enjoying herself. The witch giggled madly and asked, in a baby voice, 'Oh no, is itty bitty Potter mad?'

Harry then did something that would no doubt get him yelled at by both Hermione and Mrs Weasley if he survived --- he ran after Bellatrix, who, instead of attempting to curse him, decided to engage in a game of tag, for she turned around and fled to the lift area. Harry made it there just as her lift closed and she shot up. He ran up to the nearest lift and hammered the button until it opened and let him in.

He heard Bellatrix get out at the Atrium and followed.

'I killed Sirius Black!' Bellatrix chanted as she took cover behind the Fountain of Magical Brethren to hide from the barrage of stunners and other spells Harry sent her way. In that moment, Harry wanted nothing more than to cause her pain, to make her pay for what she'd done to Sirius. He roared in rage and yelled, 'Crucio!'

For a first Unforgivable, it was surprisingly effective, catching Bellatrix by surprise and sending her writhing on the floor. He now understood why Voldemort and his followers liked this spell so much. It gave off a certain sense of satisfaction, especially when you used it against someone who actually deserved it. Harry lost control and dropped it after a few seconds, but the feeling remained.

Bellatrix was panting, no longer finding the situation so funny.

'So, Potter does know how to cast Unfogivables,' she said, and Harry was surprised to see fear in her eyes. He rather thought it had more to do with her wand, which had flown out of reach when he'd hit her, than any real fear of him.

'Yes, I do, and now you'll find out first-hand just how much I enjoy it,' he snapped and prepared to cast the curse a second time. Before he could finish saying the words, however, the Atrium suddenly became cold --- too cold. The fear in Bellatrix' eyes was replaced by glee as she breathed, 'My lord.'

Harry swivelled around and raised his wand, prepared to duel Lord Voldemort once again, but it was taken away from him. Voldemort sneered as he fingered Harry's wand and said, his voice the barest of whispers, 'Harry Potter. So, we meet again.'

** I'm one of those people. This fic is incomplete, but the idea is for a metamorphmagus Fem!Harry growing up raised by Cassiopiea Black (she's got a cool name) it will feature the few remaining Blacks and Tonks. Including a still crazy Bellatrix who turned spy when Voldemort killed Regulus. I want to make a fic about the Blacks where Fem!Harry, Tonks and to a lesser extent Draco have to struggle to turn the House's reputation around because basically all the older Blacks were crazy violent racists and have a dark reputation for very good reasons, but blood purity has basically made them extinct.

.

When he left Cynthia Potter with Lily's sister, Petunia Dursley and her family, Albus Dumbledore did not expect any family to be around to take her in. Cynthia was to the best of his knowledge the last of the Potters, Petunia Evans and her husband were ostensibly the last of Cynthia's family. Albus knew that James' mother was Dorea Potter née Black, but of the few Blacks still alive he would never have expected any of them to have any interest in raising a Half Blood, wizarding savor or no.

Sirius of course was the girl's Godfather, he was of course unfit to be her guardian. It was still hard to believe he had betrayed the Potters, but all the evidence pointed unequivocally to his guilt. Andromeda Tonks had long ago fallen out with her birth house and had her own family besides. Narcissa Malfoy was out of the question even if she would be willing to take Cynthia in, she was married to one of Voldemort's staunchest supporters. That left very few Blacks remaining, Bellatrix though Regulus' death and the hands of Voldemort may have driven her from his service, there was no question that Bellatrix still suffered quite severely from the madness for which the House of Black was famous. No, Albus had no reason to think number 4 Privet Drive was anything other that the best possible home for Cynthia Potter. Albus felt he could be forgiven for not anticipating the presence of Cassiopeia Black inside his office.

“Lovely though tea and small talk always is perhaps we should, to borrow a delightful muggle expression, cut to the chase as it were. What can I do for you Madam Black?”

The woman across from him took a slow deliberate sip of tea “I wish to know the location of my niece. Where is Cynthia?”

Albus considered her for a moment, he had nearly forgotten Dorea Potter was Cassiopeia's sister which would make Cynthia Cassiopeia's Grandniece. “Forgive me, Madam Black, but why do you assume I know any better than you do the location of little Cynthia?”

Cassiopeia scowled “Do not insult my intelligence Headmaster, the wreckage of James and Lily's house is singing with magic and the tragedy that happened there, anyone even remotely skilled with divination could read past surrounding that place. I know you had Hagrid take Cynthia from Sirius and bring her to you, what I don't know is where he went from there. So are you going to tell me where you've taken my niece, or not?”

“And why Madam Black, do you wish to know?”

“Is it not obvious? I intend to raise Cynthia myself.”

It was the obvious answer, but it surprised Albus none the less the Blacks were one of the sacred twenty-eight and notoriously zealous about blood purity, for Cassiopeia to desire to take Cynthia in as her own, despite her blood status...Albus was suspicious. Sirius Black's recent betrayal was not helping matters. Before he could voice his objection an outraged voice came from the portrait of Phineas Nigellus Black “You can't seriously be considering raising some half blooded brat. Her mudblood mother dirties our proud - “

Phineas's rant was cut off midway with a flick of Cassiopeia's wand “You will not speak of Lily like that, if you had ever met her you would know that she was uncommonly talented muggle born or no, Lily Evans-Potter understood magic.” She spoke calmly at odds with her fierce expression and the fire in her eyes. “And you speak of our pure blood, but look where it's gotten us, most of us are dead, disowned, or in Azkaban. Bellatrix's mind is almost completely gone from fighting for the Dark Lord. Andromeda wants nothing to do with her sisters, even when they were always inseparable as children. Our obsession with blood purity with destroy the House of Black. It is time for us to adapt. Leave the past behind.” Cassiopeia turned back to address Albus “So, I'll ask you again: where is my niece?”

“Let me be plain, Madam Black, I do not trust you.”

“You are concerned, given my relation to Sirius.” It was a statement, not a question, before he could answer, she continued “You should know, Sirius did not betray them, he was not the secret keeper. The note he gave me was not in his handwriting, and Sirius never could lie to either Dorea or myself. They used Pettigrew instead.”

Shock. Disbelief Horror. Dismay. Hope. These things warred for control in Albus's head. Cassiopeia spoke again before he could process his myriad of emotions.

“The ministry will unfortunately not be inclined to listen to me given my family connection, and honestly, I have no idea if he did actually kill those muggles and Pettigrew, the Black madness might have driven his actions that night, but if your only reason to keep Cynthia from me is because you don't trust me after Sirius, I will do whatever you need to know of my sincerity. I'll take Veritaserum, even take an Unbreakable Vow, I love my niece and wish to give her the family she deserves.”

“There is another complication, Cynthia is under a ward based on Lily's sacrificial protection, she will be safe from any remaining Death Eaters seeking retribution.” It was his last feeble objection truthfully Albus very much wanted Cynthia to grow up loved and cared for, and he was not convinced that Petunia would provide the love she'd need.

“She will be safer with me. You might not know it, but Cynthia is a metamorphmagus. Dorea must have carried the gene for it. I won't be raising her as Cynthia Potter, I'll be raising her as my daughter, Miranda Black. I can't imagine they would disapprove, anything to keep her safe, even if it means the Potter name dying with them.”

Albus Dumbledore let out a deep sigh “She is with Lily's sister, I will accompany you to retrieve her tomorrow morning.”

** I've been fiddling with a alternate version of Harry Potter from a Parallel Universe where Harry tells SHIELD to fuck off (with permission from the author) and it's been "finished" for like, two months. As in, the opening premise is similar and then... its not. At all. But the initial prompt was <3 so I'm shamelessly stealing it. Sort of.

Not published, because I keep editing it. For reasons. Here's a couple snippets of it though :x

  - September 8 2003 *

  “Get. Out.”

  “Now, Mr. Potter,” the agent began.

  “No. I've personally told Fury this twice already and the answer is still no. Sit down and shut up or get out.”

  “SHIELD would like...”

  “Catch!” he interrupted, tossing a shot glass at the nameless agent.

  He did.

  “Goodbye,” Harry chirped and waved as the hapless SHIELD agent vanished with the portkey.

  “I'm sorry, I told him that we should just buy a drink and tell Fury that we tried but...” Agent Phil Coulson shrugged and took a seat at the bar. “Where did you send him?”

  “The usual: about four feet above the water by the East 34th Street ferry,” Harry said. “I'm sure somebody will fish him out. What'll it be?”

  “Hmmm. Laphroaig 10?”

  “Coming right up,” he said, pulling down the bottle. “What's Fury's newest excuse for sending you two?”

  “Teddy started school.”

  “Hmmph.” He poured the drink and levitated it over.

  Coulson raised an eyebrow. “Showing off today?”

  “Might as well, my liquor licence isn't valid for another two hours and my bartender isn't here yet.” As if to prove a point, the chairs that were still upended on the bar started settling down onto the floor on their own.

  Twenty minutes later Phil dropped some money onto the bar as his partner stuck his head through the door. “Fury's not going to give up, you know.”

  “Yeah. Good thing I'm mild mannered or there'd be bodies.”

  “Of course,” Coulson chuckled. He could appreciate a good joke, after all.

  “Absolutely not,” Harry growls, setting the pages on fire. “You keep that crap the fuck away from my kids. Why in the blue fuck did you let the UN write that wretched thing, anyway?”

  “Are you insinuating that SHIELD controls the United Nations?”

  “Of course not,” he says, scowling at the remarkably composed Coulson. “They do realize that they can't really enforce that shite, don't they?”

  “Its politics.”

  “Fuck politics, and fuck the Sokovia Accords.”

** A little idea I had about if Harry had accidentally made friends with a Mafia Don's son...it was supposed to be that he was taken in by the Mafia. Which Mafia or if I was even using the correct terms was TBD.

----

The street on Privet Drive had never been busier after dark. There were bodies moving in the shadows wherever you looked - once you actually looked. They were easy to dismiss as a trick of the remaining light.

Harry Potter had turned ten years old that day. He had spent the better part of the summer so far not at the Dursleys. He'd been in the streets, in the parks, in diners, and wherever he could find to hide from Dudley and his friends. He was old enough now that adults wouldn't automatically try to contact his parents or keep an eye on him. Not that Harry enjoyed being asked where his parents were. They were dead and the reminder of that was painful enough.

During one such time this summer he'd run into a boy around his age named Lorenzo, or Enzo for short. He was a little rough around the edges but he didn't ask Harry difficult questions and often his heart was in the right place even if his methods were not.

Harry had made his very first friend. It was such a shame that Dudley had to ruin that as well. Harry sighed heavily and buried his head in his knees.

Harry had been excited to meet Enzo at the cinemas, he'd never seen a movie and Enzo had invited him along for his birthday. He was reluctant at first as no one had ever spent money on him before, but for his first present it was pretty awesome. They'd watched a film called Gremlins...which Harry wished would inhabit the Dursley's home.

To Harry's horror when they'd left the cinema talking excitedly about the film they'd quite literally ran into Dudley. Who had made sneering comments to both Harry and Enzo. Enzo had left with steam basically coming out of his ears - though he'd made assurances to Harry that Dudley would get what was coming to him. Harry just sighed.

Enzo had not seemed horrified by Dudley nor the things Dudley had said about Harry. Enzo had seemed genuinely upset on Harry's behalf but he knew better than to hope that Dudley wouldn't squash this friendship as well.

Harry heard the doorbell ring from his cupboard. He was old enough now to be embarrassed by the cupboard. Old enough to know this was not normal. Even though his Uncle often threatened him about saying anything to anyone about it, Harry would never dream of mentioning it. It didn't mean that he wasn't going to eavesdrop and the cupboard under the stairs was in a prime position to do so.

As his uncle passed by he rapped on the door of the cupboard, a reminder for Harry to stay quiet. Harry rolled his eyes.

“Oh, hullo sir,” Harry's Uncle said, the surprise in his voice was evident. Harry's interest was piqued even more. His Uncle was never surprised by people at the door.

“Vernon Dursley?” A polished voice asked. It sounded very much like how Enzo spoke, actually. Harry had noted that Enzo had an accent but he'd never asked about it - he didn't want to push his luck with his new friend by seeming ignorant.

“Yes yes, what can I do for you?” Uncle Vernon sounded as if he was quite impressed with whomever was at the door.

“I am looking for Harry Potter,” The voice stated flatly, and Harry gasped and then covered his mouth with his hands. His body violently hit the back of the cupboard.

He was dead. So. Dead.

“Pardon, but who?” His Uncle didn't sound impressed any longer. He sounded irritated.

The voice at the door chuckled darkly. “Harry. Potter. I did not stutter.”

“No, sorry - “ There was muffled thump, a squawk and then something rather large fell on the floor. Hard enough to rattle the door on Harry's “room”.

“Wrong answer,” the voice snarled, and Harry could hear clipped footsteps that walked into the room. The footsteps slowed, seemed to pivot around as if looking...well, for Harry. Harry drew in a quiet breath and closed his eyes.

Who was this man? Why was he looking for him? What did he do to Uncle Vernon?

The footsteps retreated for a moment then started up the stairs. Harry knew his Aunt and cousin had left not that long ago to go to a film - his Uncle had stayed behind to make sure Harry didn't get into anything.

As the footsteps wandered the house, Harry could hear his Uncle starting to make some noise. The footsteps returned and then Harry flinched when he heard a sickening crunch which sounded a lot like a boot to the face. Then, suddenly, the cupboard door was flung open.

The light from the entryway streamed into his space, and he squinted, trying to squish his body back into the corner. There was a soft intake of breath before the figure that had taken care of his giant uncle in quick order crouched down. Harry tried to control his breathing, but knew it was coming in short quick bursts.

“Harry?” The voice was much nicer sounding now, even concerned. “Enzo, my son, was telling me about your...adventures this afternoon.”

Harry swallowed and looked up. “Enzo?” The man was coming into more focus. He was wearing a crisp suit, smart hat, and a trimmed goatee. The man hummed.

“Yes. He was concerned about you.” The man glanced back at Uncle Vernon, an unpleasant look on his face. “This...man, he is your relation?”

“My uncle...”
