Can be any genre but no slash or crack. I already read grow young with me, emperor, behind blue eyes and hocus pocus Adele polcus.


** linkffn(Eclipse of the Sky; Black Bond; To end in serenity; Harry Potter and the Elemental's Power)

Those are in my opinion the best fics besides the ones you've mentioned. Eclipse is by far the better one, but HP and EP is really funny at times, but also quite dark/graphical. There's some DumbledoreHating at first, but around 30~50% of the story, this changes as Harry himself gets older and starts to understand Dumbledore better.

Though nothing, and I mean nothing, is better, in my opinion, than GYWM. I simply love Taliesin's work, so much so that I even created a Tumblr account just to read/talk to her on it.

Though I haven't read Emperor, I did see a lot of people talking about as if its one of the best, so IDK.

*** Black Bond just makes me sad.

It's excellently written, and I really like all the characters.

Sirius is fucking brilliant, possibly my favorite Sirius Black characterization ever. Acquila was a good OC. I like her sometimes, and sometimes I absolutely hate her. But she's well written. Harry is good, too.

But I got so invested in the story, and it's /so fucking long/. I found out like 900k words in that there's not even any closure, and it wasn't being updated. Dropped it pretty quickly after that.

**** Same, I thought that it would have updates because on the day that I finished reading BB 1, the second chapter for BBII was updated, so I thought, "Hey, thats nice, even if takes years to keep going, at least it isn't abandoned..."

***** I'm pretty sure it isn't abandoned. I think the authors just have a lot on their plate at the moment. They had posted a little oneshot story a month or two ago and in it they noted they're still working on Black Bond II. So fingers crossed....

Also, I'm pretty sure this story has the best characterization of Harry getting his heart */absolutely trampled on/* by his love interest. Like, /I/ was in pain for him it hurt so much.

****** Yeah I just finished chapter 40 and I don't know if I want to continue reading tbh. Acquila went from an interesting 3d OC to an extremely selfish Mary Sue while Harry has lost his impulsiveness, passion and backbone from canon. The way Acquila has been treating him recently just fucking sucks and I want a satisfying conclusion because the characterisation of Sirius and the overall story is really fucking good but the angst is unreal.

To anyone looking to read Black bond I'd say its good but strap yourself in for emotional pain for Harry on a stupidly high level. Unless you're willing to wait to see if they finish and it is resolved satistfyingly I would no recommend it if you're attached to Harry as a character.

Lost Connections is pretty decently written. Not phenomenal, but it's not bad either. A decent read.

The Dark Lords' Pawn on the other hand is very well written, I like it a lot.

I've been through about a billion HP/OC fics, it's really hard to find good ones. There's an utterly absurd amount of poorly written fics, or canon-rehashes except there's an extra character that somehow manages to never seriously impact the overall plot in any way. These are the best two I can think of off the top of my head that haven't already been linked- I've previously described Eclipse Of The Sky as 'a goddamned masterpiece', and I still agree with that. Probably the best HP/OC fic. Definitely up there, though.

I wasn't really sure about linking Phoenix Accession. I enjoyed it, and I also liked Gemini Queen, the sequel. That said, I never read This Hallowed Life, the third one. It brings in a love triangle with Harry/OC/Draco. And I really really did not like that. I don't like Draco much, and I utterly despise love triangles. I wouldn't have been annoyed- some people like those, that's fine, but I was 400k-ish words deep when I found out about it. So, if you're not okay with that you know ahead of time.
