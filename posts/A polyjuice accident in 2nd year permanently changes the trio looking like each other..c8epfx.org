** Considering Harry is incredibly noble, he would explain the situation to the Grangers, and have them either send the police to get Ron from the Dursley's, or find a way to contact the Weasley's. Hermione would likely do the same as Harry and tell the Weasley's about the switch, which would motivate them to get Ron from Private drive.

If the Dursley's did anything to Harry(Ron) while he was there, I feel like Arthur would release Fred and George on them.

*** True, but for the sake of a crack fic, would be fun if they tried to play out their new roles while trying to figure out a way out of this by themselves.

Imagine GOF where Ron has to get up when Harry's name is called out but "Hermiones" magic is bound to the tournament.

Ron would also sober up after getting standard Harry treatment at Dursleys and probably be a better friend.

*** Well I just took the names she gave them in the 7th book before sending them off to Australia. Assumption is that she changed only the surname and kept the same first names.

**** It's as decent a working theory as any, but I doubt it, if for no reason than the fact that while "Wendell Granger" just about works, "Monica Granger" doesn't really roll off the tongue.

***** She could have kept her maiden name. Plenty of doctors do, and she's a dentist. Hell, if we're assuming she works with her husband, her maiden name might have been part of the business.

****** I am fairly sure that Rowling has referred to Hermione's parents as "the Grangers" in behind-the-scenes material.

****** Personally I prefer "Daniel" to "Dan" if these two must be used. A wealthy London dentist who fathered Hermione seems too strait-laced a fellow to go by "Dan". "Emma Granger" at least sounds nice enough, but for myself, if we're talking pure fanon, I prefer "Helen Granger", as the Hermione of Greek mythology was the daughter of Helen of Troy. There's also "Sally Granger".

** Here's what I'm thinking. Third year, the trio nearly get their souls sucked out, somehow their souls get mixed up. Of course Dumbledore promises that its a temporary situation and that he'll find a way to fix it, but time drags on and it becomes clear that no solution is forthcoming, so they just learn to live with it. Obviously they become quite a bit closer due to this, while at the same time this strains their relationships with the people around them. Optional gender based body dysphoria component. Optional trio threesome as well.

** I see large potential for keeping Hermione Ron pairing despite their new bodies.

Or you could go Harmony, with Harry and Hermione finding their (new) bodies end up growing attracted to one another, and Ron finding (to his dismay) that neither Harry or Hermione are attractive. Although a certain Ravenclaw Seeker catches his eye. And very confusing when he begins to notice his sister is growing up...
