:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm struggling to remember a specific fanfic. From what I remember it's set after the war. Dumbledore is dieing at hogwarts.

He gets Harry to see him on his deathbed and passes the wards to Harry making him stay at hogwarts. Harry hid after the war in a small cottage with only Dumbledore speaking to him.

Dumbledore makes Snape help and support Harry after his death.

I thinks it's a snarry but I'm not entirely sure.

Does this sound familiar to anyone please?

Thank you

  Snape finds him as he promised he would. He brings he back as he promised he would. But can he fulfil all of the promises he gave? HP/SS Will be mild slash and mentions of rape.
