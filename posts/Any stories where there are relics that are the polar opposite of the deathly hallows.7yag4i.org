I had an idea for the lifestick, the opposite of the deathstick, the ultimate healer's wand. I may futz with the idea some but it soesn't fit my current fics so it's just floating around for now.

Huh, the opposing relic to the deathly hallows stone could be the philosopher's stone now that I think about it.

I wonder what the opposing relic to harry's cloak would be?


** But isn't the Elder Wand the ultimate healer's wand already? I mean, it restores Harry's wand to normal functionality, that's not something normal wands can accomplish. Maybe its opposite would be a seal or restraint of some kind that prevents magical power from being used?

And if the Resurrection Stone has the effect of calling shades from the afterlife, wouldn't its polar opposite work to send shades (ghosts, Dementors, etc), or even living people, to the afterlife instead?

And the cloak...it's a thing of concealment and protection, so I assume its opposite would be some...lantern of exposure? Making a target less safe by revealing them, exposing their secrets, weak points, etc?

...The opposites of the Deathly Hallows actually sound like they'd be Unhallows, come to think of it.

Where the Elder Wand, Invisibility Cloak, and Resurrection Stone offer power, protection, and recall life from death for its possessor, the...Eye of Truth, Everchain, and Banishing Gem might inflict vulnerability, bondage, and ultimately sentence their living victims to death.

In the right hands, such tools could be used to root out and destroy dark and dangerous creatures, and those witches/wizards turned to cruelty & malice. In the wrong hands, though, they could allow a Dark Lord to overcome any foe...

...Yup, there's definitely story potential there. When Voldemort delves into an alternate universe in order to seek a counter for the Elder Wand & Invisibility Cloak his two greatest foes use, he happens across an alternate universe where their 'evil counterparts' exist instead.

I'm pretty sure that there are plenty of fics about vulnerability and bondage out there.

** Ohhh the lifestick is a much better idea than what I was thinking. My immediate reaction after reading the title was

- A wand that loses any battle
- A stone that kills people, but not very well
- A cloak that makes you incredibly visible, no matter how much someone tries to ignore you

And I was having a hard time imagining why someone would want to collect these hallows. Maybe someone who likes playing life on hard mode?

I'm not sure what that entails, exactly, but it sure sounds nice.

** /Hero's Cape/, when worn, enables the wearer to gain the attention of anyone who would be able to perceive them by normal means. When they gesture, their gesture /will/ be seen. When they speak, their words /will/ be heard (though not necessarily obeyed). However, the wearer does not get to choose whose attention they attract: the attention of their foes will be drawn to them as well.

** Hrm.....

You could do a crossover with the Lantern corps, or steal from them - have the Hallows aligned with a Nekron expy (maybe chaotic neutral or lawful evil).

Have opposing hallows for the Life Entity.

Possibly incorporate the Emotional Spectrum into the magic system (for example, AK is cast not from the Red of Anger, but the Green of Will, your Will-to-destroy or something).

** Enemies of the Hallows?

The mundane sceptre; able to sap all the magic out of something, rendering it entirely normal.

The fabled fountain of youth - able to cure/restore any person from their suffering, though it often wipes their recent memory in the process (perhaps as a safety precaution)

The watcher's diadem - the wearer becomes insubstantial; a silent ghost who can go anywhere, see anything, but can't do anything to interact with the world.

The more I think on it, the more likely that memory loss is a side-effect of all three of them.

** Master of Life sounds like the title that would grant someone fame, fortune, success, love. Pretty much enables someone to to win at the game of life. Thus...

CLOAK: Draws attention to you in a way that inspires FAME

STONE: keeps you from losing loved ones --> other people never turn on you, abandon you, grow apart from you --> never alone --> always loved --> LOVE

WAND: Win every duel --> spectators always see you as the winner of every battle --> winner of every verbal or physical conflict --> political success/ popularity/ always right ---> king of the world ---> SUCCESS

THUS: MASTER OF LOVE: FAME, LOVE, SUCCESS

** But in all seriousness, that could be pretty chill.

Cloak of Invisibility => The Eyeball of Oh God Why. It lets you see everything. At once. Takes a very strong mind to not go insane by sensory overload.

Resurrection Stone => The Shiny Rock of Obliviousness. It lets you not see living people.

Elder Wand => The Stick of Improbably Convenient Failure. It fails every spell in such a spectacular manner that half the time it actually ends up solving the problem anyways.

When you unite the three items, you become the Master of Life. The perks?

Literally Unlimited Lemonade.
