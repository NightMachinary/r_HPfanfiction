linkffn(The Disorder of the Phoenix)

Really liked this premise and haven't read any similar to that one, except one where Harry and his 3 kids(James, Albus and Lily) + Teddy(he's 18 i think in that story) go back because of an experimental time-turner.

Anyone know another good or at least longer fic besides those 2 ?

*** Wow - the first chapter of this story (and that's all I could read, before I had to force myself to come back here and make this comment), is absolutely fucking terrific.

It's amazing. I love it so far.

I can't vouch for the rest of the story, but even if it's complete shite, everyone would be doing themselves a favor by reading the first chapter, at least.

EDIT: Second chapter is also great.

EDIT: Shit, I got to chapter 6 before coming back here.

It's all great. Just read it.

  Seven years after defeating Voldemort, Harry Potter has been living in the United States as a DADA Prof at Ilvermorny, taking his godson, Teddy Lupin and Teddy's grandmother, Andromeda Tonks with him. What will happen when Fawkes the Phoenix pulls the happy family back in time for a chance at a better future. Set before the breakout from Azkaban in Order of the Phoenix. No paradox

  Canon-compliant up to most of DH, more than 10 years later in a hyper-magical, post-apocalyptic Britain, a spectator sneaks into the empty Once-Ministry to watch Harry Potter and Voldemort's final duel. Unfortunately, just as victory finally arrives, an unlikely escape triggers an unexpected beginning.
