I'm sick and tired of reading about the wizarding world having low population. It makes no sense. With their advanced healing technology, and the ability to live for over a century, youd think they would breed like rabbits.


** Then you might as well drop the Statute while you're at it. 500 million---1 billion wizards? Okay, /maybe/ the SOS is intact. But a 50/50 split? Unless the 3.5---4 billion wizards live in uninhabited areas like uncharted islands, underground, underwater, etc then I have to call bs. And even then it's a stretch.

As for why wizard populations are so low, it's a combination of genetics, wars (Grindelwald, VoldWarI, VoldWarII) and how their society works. In first world countries, birthrates are generally lower than in underdeveloped countries. Plus, if wizards were as populous as Muggles, living as long as they do (115+ compared to Muggle's ~80) they would cause a bigger drain on resources, not to mention maintaining the Statute would be much harder.

*** Alternative option: With a thousand times higher population new spells get invented a thousand times faster and magic is ridiculously advanced. Wizards achieved faster than light travel centuries ago and mostly live on Kepler-438b. Hogwarts is just for muggleborns and wizards who want to do jobs on earth studying muggle culture and progress while 99% of the wizard population lives offworld.

**** This. Very much this. It just doesn't make sense that wizarding nations have such low populations. Even should there be wars in the past, men and women would come back to breed like cows just as the aftermath of the WW2, and population would sore.

I mean, I assume wizards and witches like sex, yes?

*** There's actually 90% wizards and the SoS is a half-hearted attempt to keep them in the dark about the existence of magic, but they all know anyway because they're all relatives of wizards at this point, so really it's just a bureaucratic formality

The last muggle who didn't know about magic lived some time in 1911, but he was eventually told when it was discovered that his second cousin twice removed was actually a witch, so now the obliviators and reversal squads have just been sitting around playing cards for the last 90 years

** There's plenty of evidence among muggles that the higher your standard of living and life expectancy, the lower your birthrate. Excluding immigration most 1st-world nations have replacement (2 kids per 2 parents) or lower these days.

Most Wizarding families we see are closer to extinction as of the 90's than they are to breeding like rabbits (who do so because they die so often in the wild, not due to long safe lives) - with Malfoy, Potter, Longbottom, and several others apparently down to a single kid - and at a minimum the Crouches, Pettigrews, and Lestranges appear to have done so, Blacks as well if you only count the male line / surname, Dumbledores once Abeforth dies, etc...

At the rate things are going, in another few generations it will be the Hogwarts School of Weasleys and Muggleborns since that will be all that's left

*** To add to your first point, womens' control over their own reproductive activity is another *major* factor in population growth. If there's a simple contraception charm (as in a lot of fanon), then that could go a long way towards keeping wizarding numbers down while muggle women have had little choice in the matter for most of history.

It's the demographic transition model. As our standard of living improved and lifespans increased, people started having less kids, to the point where many countries have a fertility rate lower than the death rate. I think this applies as much to the wizarding world as it does to our muggle world. Just look at how many only child families there are in the series. If you have a small starting population, add a low fertility rate and devastating wars every couple generations, it makes sense that wizards have a low population.

  Massively AU. Assume nothing. Harry Potter is born into a very different world than the one in canon. A world where the Greats of history walk among mere men. A world where power is all that matters, and young Harry Potter is a commodity desired by many.

** This would not happen realistically due to the demographic transition model; but it's magic so let's try!

​

I could imagine, that in the humble beginnings of magic, not a lot of say, healing and contraceptive magic was yet invented. But, let's add 'sex magic'. Basically, you get a population without contraceptives, little-to none healing and pretty low standards of life but with sex magic, that let's say increases fertility. Now let's blow this out of proportion and say that when the population started booming, the magical people interbred with the muggles quite a lot more then in canon, due to sex magic.

So, for muggles wizard were like Veelas are to wizards - extremely alluring, fertile, and beautiful. (This could also explain where Veelas come from, maybe some witches figured out to incorporate sex magic into their bodes permanently, and also pass it over to the next generation.) Now, you have a good amount of magical population, let's say 10 times more then in canon. Due the much larger population, wizards can, effectively rule over the muggles, who still are in the middle ages. But, contraceptive and healing magic have already been invented, which means the population boom rapidly slows down. Pure blood bigotry and inbreeding never become a large issue, because sex magic studies and experiments on muggles show that inbreeding is extremely unhealthy- and produces a lot of squibs. Thus, the so-called pure bloods are forced to marry into muggles or 'mud bloods'. This boosts they're magic, so bigotry is no longer an issue.

Now, because wizards are practically lording over muggles, there would be quite a few bastard children, and legitimate ones too. We know that magic + muggle typically result in a magical offspring. This again, increases population, not by much, but still, an increase. There is also much more space to expand for wizards now, and let's say because they are much more advanced by now, magic concentration is much higher in the areas wizards live. Because muggles are slaves for the wizards, they naturally live in close proximity to the high magic concentration areas. This results in a much, much higher chance of a muggle born being born. This boosts the population significantly again, and boom. Now the wizarding world has a crap ton of population.
