I play Magic: the Gathering and I started thinking what if during the final battle if Harry vanished after defeating Voldemort because his Planeswalker Spark ignited. What colours would he be? Maybe he ends up in Ravnica or Dominiria.


** I've started a couple fics like that, but they never go anywhere. I chose to do it to Zendikar, since I felt like it would be a more adventure-based story
