I'm a perv and I like harems. I'm looking for any that aren't complete shit. The only one I've read that comes to mind is Firebird's Son.

Thanks for any recs you have for me.


** If you want a "believable" Harem where girls all have their own personality and backstory. Where you can't just swap one name for another and have the exact same sex scene... One that pokes fun at other harems, and cliches in general...

Then you want something like my 'Searching for the Power' on ffn or hpff or ficwad *shameless self plug*

There are a whole lot of the other kind though, most Harems are just an excuse to write porn. Mine is more like a good Anime harem (but with sex instead of unresolved tension)

** Okay look. Here's a list. Some might be "good", some are meh. I can't even say anymore. Most will be very famous. For me, that part of my fanfic reading past is now all just a blur of discarded school uniforms, things being "grasped", and lots of panting.

  Voldemort didn't like what happened at the Department of Mysteries and viewed the connection as a liability he could no longer afford. The steps he took changed Harry's life forever, and set him on the path to victory. Fem Harry. Harry.Multi.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it.

Until I checked my list, I didn't even realize this one was finished. That is how much I care about harem fics. Some of the new ideas here are interesting, but it isn't exactly the most tightly plotted thing ever.

Still being updated, has a dark sort of approach. Dumbledore isn't a good guy, if that wasn't clear. A bit of DLP bait, but not a bad new idea for plots. The most extreme AbusedLuna I've ever read, possibly too over the top. zArkham is an idea leader in what he does.

Whew! Hope that helps some.

Exactly. Just because you don't like a genre, doesn't mean other people are obligated to dislike that genre

***** I think it's more the fact that authors who might tend to be, uh, "worse" at writing would tend to gravitate toward writing a harem fic. I'm just talking out of my ass, though.

That being said, I've yet to read a good harem fic. Feel free to prove me wrong!
