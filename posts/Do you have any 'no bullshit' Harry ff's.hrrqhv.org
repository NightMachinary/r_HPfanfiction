I mean FF's where Harry says what he means and doesn't take any shit from others, calls them out if they say something wrong intentionally, are trying to scam someone or if something is just absurd or someone's action not logical. (Wanting to let the Slytherin go back to the dungeon, where the troll is supposed to be.)

I like this one because Harry starts directly calling Dumbledore on all his BS. Later in the fic the other teachers start using it also.

  "Ah yes, very good." Dumbledore said with a twinkle in his eye. "But my point still stands. She's not on the list of permitted pets and so I'm afraid she must go."

  "Ding." Harry said. Dumbledore fell silent and frowned at him. "That's my bullshit detector." Harry explained, and McGonagall gasped. "Ron has a rat, Lee has a tarantula, and therefore I can only conclude that the reason you don't want me keeping a snake is because it's a snake, and thus has ominous connotations with Slytherin and everything 'evil." Snape's mouth twitched again.

  Harry spent his first year hiding his intelligence and playing the role of the Boy Who Lived. However Lockhart and Malfoys' combined presence finally causes him to snap, and chaos ensues from there.

*** It has some funny moments.

Sadly a bit too bashy and tropey for me to fully enjoy it.
