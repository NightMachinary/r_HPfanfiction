I am currently writing a post-apocalyptic fanfiction. However, the main crux of my story will be focusing on how Harry and co put their lives and world back together. The problem with this is that it wouldn't be immediate: there's gonna be some fumbling around and general learning curve to the new way that the world works. While I think that some of this could be interesting, I want to focus on 7 years after the "apocalypse", as this is when my story will take place.

Does anyone have a graceful way of jumping to this point? I fear that any prologue I had would be an awfully boring info dump, but that this information is needed to set up the stakes of the story.

I am currently thinking of doing dated 3-4 lines of dialogue between people for major events in the first years. It would give a snapshot of the moment, without droning on about it.

Any help or experienced first-hand lessons would be very much appreciated. I am also interested in finding a beta if anyone would be interested in that.


** I'm reading some "writing how-to" e-books/web sites right now because I want to write my own fanfiction stories, so I have a Word document saved with some useful tips that I've found. I'll share what I found about first chapters.

(I didn't write down the source for this tip) Opening paragraphs usually include -

- *Limited backstory* - Start your story with an actual scene. Too much backstory right away gets boring.
- *Action* - Something significant needs to happen to grab the reader's attention.
- *Minimal setting and background description* - Too much detail about the setting gets boring. You can always explore everything in more detail later, but for the first chapters, the reader only needs enough to know where and what they are looking at.
- *The story's mood or genre* - You should set the mood and tone of the story early in the beginning (i.e. if it's science fiction, it should feel like one right away)

Here are some tips from Chapter 28 (First chapters) of Writing Love (Screenwriting Tips for Authors, II) by Alexandra Sokoloff (it's a great resource for those who are writing non-romance books as well):

- *Skip the back story for now* - Start the story in an actual scene in which your main character is in the middle of action. The reader should not just be watching the action, but feeling the sweat, smelling the salt air, feeling the roiling of their stomach as they step into whatever unknown. The reader doesn't need to know everything going on right away. Curiosity is a big hook. What we need to do is get inside the character's skin.
- *Detail the internal drives of your charater and set the genre* (what are their desires and what is blocking them). We need to get a sense of the genre, a strong sense of mood and tone, and a hint of the theme.
- *Something has to happen immediately that gives us an idea what the story is about.* Get to the 'inciting incident' and 'call to adventure' as soon as possible.

*TL;DR* - Skip the back story stuff at the very beginning because info dumping is boring. Start with action and weave in the details later.

This may not be 100% of what you were looking for but /hopefully/ it can give you some ideas you can work with. Good luck!

*** I like this advice a lot, thank you for posting. Biggest concern in regards to this is not understanding the middle of the action. The first chapter that I have written does indeed get into this, with Harry on a recon mission gone very wrong. I'm mostly worried that the stakes of the scene would seem less without an understanding of the backstory, but maybe the curiosity of why Harry's working with Draco and willing to do some questionable stuff is worth not knowing the organization they're spying on.

** You don't have to illustrate every single detail, it's more about giving your readers a frame of reference. There are certain shorthands to convey the idea of "big brother" or "nuclear wasteland." As long as you establish that this is the kind of world where everyone has an 8pm curfew enforced by dementors, readers won't be surprised when the Ministry reveals that they've been tracking the main characters' movements.

It really depends on the characteristics of the world we're talking about.

I would try to paint a picture of the world with as few strokes as possible. I know that personally I can get really into world building but the reader doesn't really need to know all of that information to understand what's going on. Just as how you don't need to know Harry's favorite colour to understand who is as a person.

And the more background you front-load, the more likely readers are too skim it.

But in terms of exposition, maybe a long-form newspaper article? If there's a specific event that set off this change (either the Battle of Hogwarts or some other post-Voldemort incident), you can start with something about the anniversary of this event, and make oblique and direct references to how things have changed since.

A homework assignment from another character, or a page from a reference book?

A letter or an official document?

A series of short newspaper articles/headlines over those 7 years?

** Just get in there.

The AU setting is a background. Background. Background.

A lot of authors try to explain the whole background in the summary or in a large exposition. It's a mistake. What you want to do is give your character some agency. Involve them in something that's meaningful. That's the hook. Sure, some AU ideas are good enough to make the reader interested, but you still need to hook them in.

You want your characters actions and dialogue to explain the world. So, just get right in there.

** Jump straight into the main plot. Leave any AU changes as interesting questions to be revealed later. That builds tension, which is very important in the first few chapters. Explain things as gracefully as possible given the tone and style of your story once things get moving. This might mean straight narrative flashbacks, dream sequences, or just conversations between people who remember what happened reminiscing or filling in someone else.

Oh, and mention in the summary and at the top of the first chapter that it is an AU story, so some Albus/Rose shipper who wanders in doesn't get confused.

** Start with the point of divergence. In this case, it's the thing that triggers the apocalypse.

Then provide viewpoints that highlight how the situation has changed against standard canon. In this case, it's a combination of scarcity, lack of long-range communications capabilities, leftover technology becoming more valuable than the surviving communities and roving bands of former military & law enforcement personnel raiding underarmed and undermanned civvie camps for ressources and/or 'volunteers' to 'help' rebuild some of the infrastructure. Use some of the post-nuclear war rebuilding plans considered during the cold war (which actually did include ideas such as seen above) as reference material.

Now, introduce Hogwarts. Now come several questions: Has the apocalypse affected magical society that greatly? Could there be paradoxically more muggleborn afterwards than there would have been before? Have the survivors become aware of magic? Have magical creatures actually spread into the ruins of society only to be mistaken for mutants? What kind of life do/did the protagonists lead? How will they react to the fat, happy society that seems ripe & ready for the plucking?

All these, and more, need to be answered fairly quickly early on during the plot. Otherwise, have at it!

** Try to mix the world building in with 'live-action' and plot advancement. Don't write paragraphs after paragraphs explaining the history, but rather have characters mentioning it. You can always elaborate later. You don't have to lay down the entire law in the first few chapters, but build on it as you go along. However, do try to at least mention certain 'rules' of the universe before they come into play in a major way, so that you don't leave your audience in the dark.

Good luck with writing! Be sure to link it on here when you start posting, I'd like to check it out :)

** I'm currently writing an AU fanfic set in a world where Voldemort invaded Britain in 2001, won by 2006, in which Harry Potter and the Unspeakables disappeared for a decade only to return in 2011. I mention some of these things in the summary where relevant, and then the rest is expanded through the story.

Bits and pieces get mentioned in character monologues, some of the history comes up in dialogue, there are flashback scenes... but my AU is part of a much larger AU setting which I haven't fully revealed yet. My intention is to produce something that feels like the canon but with some very different specifics. There are some huge differences between my setting and canon that have only got a brief mention because it's not relevant to detail yet, and in any case there wasn't a place to put it.

I started off by dropping the reader directly into the present - Harry Potter on a secret mission from the Unspeakables. Then in that chapter I explored what the mission was, why Harry was working for the Unspeakables, and showed their public return to society after a decade. But I didn't give all of the details of everything, and subsequent chapters go on to explore more of and develop the AU setting.

So I would suggest that you be sparing with the details that aren't absolutely necessary. Have some faith in your readers, too - some things might be confusing at first, but I'm sure that given context they'll figure out something strange is going on. You can explore the setting further when people are used to its present situation.
