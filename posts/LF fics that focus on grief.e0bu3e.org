The grief/mourning doesn't have to be the sole focus of the fic, but it should be a significant part. Any characters are welcome, but please no bashing or death eater apologism. If pairings are involved, I prefer canon compliant ones. Any length is fine, and /Fantastic Beasts/ fics are welcome, too. Thanks!


** Linkffn(11111990)

I think that fits pretty well. Canon and epilogue compliant with pairings and children.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

*** I'd seen this fic recced before but I always gave it a pass because Harry/OC isn't a ship I'm particularly interested in, but clearly I was missing out - I binge-read the whole thing today (and got a little weepy at the flashback to Ginny's death, ngl). Thanks!

**** Yes, I had to see it recced many times too before I finally gave in and read it to see what all the fuzz was about, for much the same reason. And I absolutely loved it, it has to be by for the depiction of a grieving and healing Harry I have come accross. I just hope the update frequency goes back to how it was before this last chapter, which took nearly 10 months to be posted.

Good to hear you enjoyed it.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1067936][Gryffindor tie(s) by Amaru_Katari]] but it is all about consequences of a suicide, and the author was dealing with self-inflicted death in his family, so it is very raw and if you are that type of person it could be a trigger for PTSD and similar stuff.

** Grief is a rather big part of Stages of Hope, though I'm sure you've read it before: it's a classic for a reason. linkffn(6892925)

Rebuilding is Hogwarts after the war, and pretty much the entire school dealing with assorted ptsd symptoms. Dramione that's mostly kinda sorta realistic - the rest of the pairings are canon. Brushes up against death eater apologism, but doesn't actually cross the line (makes a distinction between kids "forced" into it vs those that took the mark willingly). Yes, the chapters are ridiculously short. linkffn(11439594)

I can probably add more later, but these are the only two I can think of off the top of my head.

I would say that most of it is just interaction between the characters - the stars are Pansy, Millicent, the Ravenclaw Patil (lol), Neville, Theo, Susan, Hannah and some OCs from younger years in addition to Hermione and Draco. The ship is there, but its not really the point of the story.

That being said, I completely understand: that ship is absolutely not to everyone's taste and is pretty polarizing for a reason.

***** If it makes you feel better, it's not just Draco/Hermione I avoid - I dropped /The Arithmancer/ a few chapters from the end because it turned into Hermione/Fred. I'm just a boring person who almost exclusively goes for canon ships.

But I did finish /Stages of Hope/ and really liked it, so thanks again!
