** linkao3(Dudley Dursley and the Sorcerer's Stone)

Time travel + Dudley turns into a wizard. Might sound like bleh! but it's really very good. The author is on the sequel now.

#+begin_quote
  Dudley Dursley, 37, has only just put his daughter on the Hogwarts Express and said goodbye when Platform 9 3/4 is attacked. In the ensuing explosion, he blacks out - and wakes up as an eleven year old back in Privet Drive. Confused and wary, he finds himself blundering through his life all over again, and unfortunately, being eleven isn't the only surprise in store.

          Hello, friends\! This is incredibly exciting for me, in part because I haven't written any fic since 2007, and it's been even longer since I've tried my hand at Harry Potter fic\.
    The whole idea behind this fic was taking a Muggle character, giving him the tiniest magic possible, and sticking him in Hogwarts in a position where he could influence both the political climate of the Wizarding world and the outcome of the War\. I thought it would be even better to make it time travel, so that he would know that something terrible was coming, but he would have no idea of the details or of any way to stop it\. All he would know were a few words that people had told him\.
    As for the pairing of Dudley and Padma, I knew I wanted to have him married to a witch\. I also knew that I wanted her to be a lot more intelligent\. Even so, it's completely out of left field, and that, I have to admit, was also part of the appeal\. It seemed to fit, and I like to think that they met by accident and were kind of spiky for a while\.

** My favorite wizard dudley fic is The Better Man by Laume linkffn(3570937). It's an amazing mentor!Snape fic where Dudley goes to Hogwarts and Harry chooses to attend a school in Rome.

This fic By Baker Street Station, I Sat Down and Wept by Deco linkffn(8864658) is from Petunia's POV. Dudley and Harry consider each other brothers and both attend Hogwarts, while Vernon is the abusive bad guy.

In these fics Blind Faith and Blind Faith: Slytherin's Heir by xyvortex linkffn(2046881; 2420227) Dudley is also a wizard but can't attend Hogwarts right away due to an illness. He goes to Hogwarts with Harry in the second fic. Both are enjoyable.

  Petunia Dursley has trouble: she's lost her family, she's going crazy, she can do magic (but not always), her suitors are a mixed bag (operative word) & people keep trying to take her children away from her. They should be very afraid. (Not only a) Double Severitus. WARNING: Not what you expected.

**** It's apparently not abandoned, but it hasn't updated in quite a long time. I read it the second time recently, and it's great, but it does stop at chapter 69 (which is the end of fifth year at least so it doesn't end in the middle of the year like some).

** I just finished reading linkffn(6762561), strictly speaking it's not actually dudley, but an OC sister. Honestly, the thing that sets it apart from these other recs is that even though she starts to love harry as part of the family because of magic, she goes about it in the most Dursley-ish manner possible. She tries to be better, but she has so many ingrained prejudices, that trying to check her privilege is a challenge.

  AU. Strangely enough, being a Muggleborn witch in a House that wants her dead isn't Daisy Dursley's only problem; her parents are constantly redefining normality, she's actually getting on with her brother and a lot of the time being related to the Boy-Who-Lived is more trouble than it's worth.
