**** Ah, my bad, I hadn't read it in a while, so I forgot that was factor. As I was re-skimming to determine amount of slash, doesn't seem as well written as a fanfic. I think I rescind that recommendation, I read it back when I wasn't as discerning as I am now. The author made it 'pg-15' so I think it's non-explicit after ch. 17 onward if you do venture into reading it.

** linkffn(11157943) has Harry being something llike 1700 years old. It's a Star Wars The Clone Wars crossover. If you've seen the prequels you should be good, I think. If you haven't seen TCW, you might need to know that Ahsoka Tano was Anakin's padawan until she was thrown out of the jedi order for a crime she didn't commit and refused reinstatement after proving her innocence.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

** The Potter's Protector series by mjimeyg

linkffn(7665632;8804823;9628789;12022968)

In Potter's Protector Harry is neither immortal nor ancient but the next 3 stories make up for it.

They are crossovers, we have Buffy (first and fourth story), Marvel (second through fourth story), Smallville (third and fourth story), time travel, dimension travel, harems, and a fifteen million year old Harry (but he only likes to admit to ten million) by the second story.

**** You should be fine with the third one if you know that Lex did not start out as evil, and until the fourth one you will be fine if you know that Xander is one of Buffy characters, a rather important one to the plot, and is basically someone who fought against supernatural threats despite being normal, who has something of a protective instinct for those close to him, and who manages to find some way, for the better or for the worse, out of any situation (so basically actually a good person to take care of Harry if you think about it).

There's some other, but altogether minor, stuff that references Buffy before the fourth one, but you will be fine without knowing anything about them really.

The fourth one, however, is a straight-out Buffy soup with some other stuff for flavour, so depending on how quick you are at recreating the world of something in your mind from scratch you may or may not just end up sitting there confused.

*** I do believe it also crosses over with Supernatural in the fourth story. Just wanted to add that.

** If you don't mind a bit of shameless self promotion, I just wrote a one shot like this. Linkao3(quietus ascends) - it's a crossover with the Piers Anthony series Incarnations of Immortality. You don't need to know the Incarnations series to enjoyn it/understand it, although I think that would make it more enjoyable.

  Harry Potter has lived a full life. But coming back to life is not without consequences. Because when is it ever easy being Harry Potter? Certainly not when Fate has taken a personal interest in your life
