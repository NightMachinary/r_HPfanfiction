I'm sure this has been requested here before, but I'm just looking for good fics that center around Harry as a professor at Hogwarts. I know there's a lot out there, but I've only been able to find Harry/Draco, Harry/Snape, and Harry/Riddle ones, none of which I like as a pairing. Any good recommendations that don't have these pairings in them? Thanks!


** There's this old Harry/Hermione one that I remember reading years ago. It's linkffn(An Organ of Fire). It wasn't bad from what I remember.

  Seven years after defeating Voldemort, Harry Potter has been raising his godson, Teddy Lupin with the help of Teddy's grandmother, Andromeda Tonks. What will happen when Fawkes the Phoenix pulls this happy, war-weary family back in time for a chance at a better future. Set before the breakout from Azkaban in Order of the Phoenix. No paradox.

** Google Hope by Jeconais, he's a flying instructor at Beauxbatons, and then they move to Hogwarts for something that Dumbledore does. Its AU, with a very very powerful Harry.

Also there's a few that I remember linkffn(0800-Rent-A-Hero; Yellow Submarine; Delenda Est) Though in Delenda it isn't actually really important. Its just a cover. Note that Yellow Submarine has some pretty dark moments.

*** You know, I read all of Jeconais's stories when I was 16 and I loved them. A few years later, I looked them up and they were just unreadable.

They have this sort of French romanticism to them that puts French culture on a pedestal, and that wouldn't be so bad if the characters were less 'soap opera', you know? It makes the French obsession a bit overbearing. They read like they're all being played by Tommy Wiseau, but better educated. Stilted and strange, is how they talk to each other.

Obscene power and character bashing is how Jeconais keeps his protagonist in charge; there is never, ever a point in any of his stories where the fate of the 'righteous' is in doubt. He's always right, everybody is always in awe, and the villains are the most despicable slime to slither on this Earth.

Nothing makes sense. Logic is thrown out. There is only the protagonist, and his righteous quest, which he finds very simple and easy because he's so amazing, and then there's the next goal. And somehow, everything gets wrapped around this perversion of faux-French culture which is based on the most ludicrous French stereotypes. If I were French I would be insulted at this ignorant American trying to write about the French in a positive way, and failing absolutely.

All in all, it's head and shoulders above most Harry Potter fanfiction, and I recommend it.

  “You understand, Professor,” Harry began, after a moment, “that I don't have my N.E.W.T.s. I don't even have my O.W.L.s.

So technically, I am completely unqualified for the position.”“Quite a way to begin an interview, Mr. Potter,” McGonagall said dryly.Or, three years after the war, Harry Potter becomes Hogwarts' newest Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.
