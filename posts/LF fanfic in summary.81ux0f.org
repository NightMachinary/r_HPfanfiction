Looking for the fanfic another person wrote about.

a fic a bit back where Harry had lost nearly everything, ends up in a different dimension where Harry died as a baby and Voldemort won and became leader of the world. Harry is portrayed as being extremely powerful (absorbs magic), and not afraid of killing or torture or the darker side of things (mainly as it pertains to death eaters), but isnt so far gone he kills with abandon anyone apart from death eaters. There is slavery and abuse and rape involved on Voldemorts side, and while Harry doesn't like that (as it pertains to innocents), he also is not exactly a perfect individual himself, and sex or slavery or torture can be a tool when necessary.


** Harry Potter and Merlin's Reaper sounds like what you are talking about.
