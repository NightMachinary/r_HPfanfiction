Looking for a fanfic i read some time ago but can't remember the name of,

Not a huge deal to go off but here goes:

Harry is a ravenclaw (I think), does v.well in all his classes (might be on a fast track), spends a lot of time managing the Potter accounts (has a "drop-box" from the goblins), finds out he is the Black hier and has to deal with those accounts too, Dumbledore is suspicious of him somewhat but with no real reason.

I'm sorry there isn't much to go on here but any pointers would be welcome,

Any other "Hogwarts fast track service" fics would be welcome


** What do you mean with fast track? Jumping a grade?

*** Essentially but closer to reducing the 7 years down to 4 (I think it was 4) with OWLS after 2 years and NEWTS after another 2 years.
