What bothers you the most out of the Harry Potter series. Mine is that the magical world labels everything magical. I find it so odd.

They've separated from the Muggles and I don't think they consider themselves a department of the Muggle government so why would they feel the need to label everything that they do Magical? E.g. Ministry of Magic, Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Department of Magical Games and Sports.

To the magicals, everything would just be The Ministry of the UK, Department of Law Enforcement, etc. It'd even be better if a cover for the muggles. Seriously, the way it is in canon makes it seem like they're constantly talking as a foreigner to their own society. As an American, I would say Senate not American/US Senate.

Are there magic farms with magic chickens to lay magic eggs? Are there magic textile factories? Are there magical cutlery manufacturers? The magical world must have some point of interaction with the muggle world, because it makes no sense for them to have a completely separate shadow economy.

***** Why not? I don't doubt that wizards have excellent ways to grow crops and raise animals with herbology being a core class. Even before the statute, wizards enjoyed far better lifespans and quality of life. I doubt that would have held if wizards had relied predominantly on inconsistent muggle food distribution pre-statute. It took technology for muggles to catch up to a higher quality of life (and even now, muggle lifespans are still dozens of years shorter). What reason would wizards have to switch to relying on muggles?

And if the Weasleys are any indication, they have magic farms with chickens to lay eggs.

** Obliviate and Love Potions. The Harry Potter universe is a rapist's dream world and besides Voldy's backstory, this is never adressed. And even then, Merope is portrayed to be as much of a victim as Tom Riddle Senior. Hogwarts teaches how to brew Amortentia, the Twins are selling love potions that last 24 hours, Molly tells stories of how she used them to Hermione and Ginny like it's completely normal...

Pretty cruel in my opinion. To love somebody you don't, and that guy/girl may take advantage of your state and basically rape you knowingly or unknowingly - and the potion will force you to feel nice just as the Imperius Curse makes the victim feel nice.

Slightly Off-topic: Yeah, the world of Harry Potter is the paradise of every sick fcuk out there. Let's be honest, the Death Eaters are the best example to show how flawed the Ministry of Magic and its whole system is.

** How sorting works. There is no way the houses can all be evenly divided. There could easily be a year where there is twice as much Gryffindors as Slytherin. In real British boarding schools, I'm pretty sure houses are evenly split to avoid this, but that doesn't apply when it's a hat deciding. Imbalanced housing would make things unfair when it comes to points.

And what magic tells the Goblet peoples names and makes it official to the point that they can sign a contract? If Harry decided to go by Harrison Brown all his life, then would the contract not count? If it's based on some magical birth certificate then that brings an issue since Harry's would say Harry James Potter not just Harry Potter. And what if some other Wizard was named Harry Potter?

What if Harry decided to change his name, thus erasing "Harry Potter" from the Goblets "mind".

Same thing also applies to the map, which also doesn't use middle names if people put their names into some magic system which makes it "official".

Seriously how do names work?

Almost as if the hat might be deliberately bullshitting things, especially when the people it's sorting are eleven-year-olds who, let's be real, have likely never had to show or develop any distinguishable amount of bravery, loyalty, intelligence or cunning/ambition in their lives

Considering that they're 11, there's far fewer hat stalls than their should be - my guess would be that the hat stalls are far less to do with someone who is hard to sort, but actually involve someone who doesn't fancy the hat's top choice. The hat could simply stop offering choices if it became too imbalanced. Before the hat, the founders chose from the cohort who they wanted to teach, but it's implied they never send a student away.

Simple human psychology explains why people would merge their behaviour towards their identified group. So my thought is that many end up acting like their house, because they are in it. If it doesn't happen that way, it's not as though there's an exit-test.

Remember that even counts Diagon Alley as "not purely magical". From this we can hypothesize if it has contact with or is hidden within a muggle settlement it doesn't count. But Diagon Alley is still extremely isolated. Most wizards don't go there through muggle London. They apparate or use the floo. I believe most wizard settlements function like this.

I don't think they buy shaving cream or Gillette razors. I would say they have old fashioned razors and potions/lotions for shaving. And why wouldn't they forbid you from using magic? If an adult wizard can end up with an heavy animal on top of him because he mispronounced a spell, teenage boys would be ripping their faces off while trying to shave with a wand.

I would argue that Obliviate is not Wingardium Leviosa. So it is not an everyday threat. And even if it was, there is a very simple explanation for why people don't leave reminders or whatever. People are stupid in general. By your logic why would anyone believe that a Nigerian prince left them money? Why would people give their credit card information to people they don't know? Don't they know there are scammers out there? Real life makes no sense!

As far as I know it works only on simple stuff. And even then you have to be competent. You can't just duplicate a functioning race broom for example. The wood is no problem but what makes it fly can't be duplicated. Resources are plenty but craftsmanship is still valuable. There are still stuff that need to be done manually by people. And for those things there is an economy. And things fall into order around that. I don't recall anything about there being shops for mundane stuff like cabbages in the entire seven books. Which leads me to assume anything bought or sold has /some/ quality that makes it valuable.

In fairness, it seems like most Wizards live in semi-seclusion, based on the fact that the Weasleys, Lovegoods, and Malfoys, three families in /vastly/ different economic positions, all have houses either on the outskirts of or entirely outside muggle towns.

As for currency, while most competent witches and wizards wouldn't need it to live day to day, it makes sense that there would be certain specialist items or services that you'd have to pay for if you couldn't make/perform them yourself.

*** I believe that a lot wizards are out of touch with the muggle world even if they live in a muggle community. For example, the Weasleys live in a muggle village but they're never really shown interacting with the muggle community. They can Apparate or Floo directly to Diagon Alley/St. Mungo/Hogsmeade.

Also why are muggle children not allowed to drive a car even though cars are so convenient and pretty much most people own one? The magic can be quite dangerous even for adults so you would definitely not want it in the hands of inexperienced children.

I think that Obliviation is a threat since Tom Riddle uses it on several occasions to cover his tracks. Also Lockhart is using it to steal credit for other people's actions. How the Ministry or even the average Wizard handle this threat is not discussed in the books.

Finally, a reasonably competent Wizard could probably live decently as a Muggle. But in the books, most of the magical stores sell things such as wands, potion ingredients, magical artifacts, things that most people would not be able to create. Also don't forget that conjuring spells are NEWT level Transfigurations.

300 years passed since the separation so why isn't the population much larger? Even if you take into account the Blood War (Grindelwald's war didn't have much of an impact in Britain) then the population should still be much larger than it is.

His job is all about magical law enforcement and disenchanting things that muggles use, neither of which require any knowledge about muggles.

Arthur does not need to know how a car works. If a car starts flying and having a life of its own, it's Arthur's job to confiscate the car and disenchant it. That is it.

It goes on through, and runs back into the “steam”. But it doesn't just Go Away, it continues. That's why there are two wires to a light. One for electricity In, the other Out.

You think the wizard world is better? Fine, that's alright. But if so, you need to /prove/ it, and not just lip-service it. Replace the Hogwarts Express with a Portkey station or something.

**** I said a /bit/ more, because at least they acknowledge that magic has benefits whenever they mix magic and technology.

Here's my opinion on Mugglewank:

If you're gonna have the Muggles win or call a stalemate against the wizards, at least /try/ to make it realistic. Get the government to hire Squibs and wizards loyal to their cause and protect against magic. Have some scientist create a device that protects against mind-control. Have them use some secret MIB-like organization to Obliviate wizards with a 'flashy-thing' and restore memories that the wizards Obliviated/False Memory Charmed from Muggles that saw too much. Have them play 'Crouching moron, hidden badass' for /decades/ to lull wizards into even further complacency. Hell, even have aliens that like Muggles more than wizards come into play to help them out. /Anything/ but this "Gunz and nukez so wizards lose lol" rubbish. That would be a pyrrhic victory /at best/ on the Muggles' part.

*** This is a pretty weak argument, I think.

1. As far as we know, all the "Muggle" objects that wizards use are enchanted objects - they replicate the effect of a Muggle technology using magic, rather than literally using Muggle tech. So all their existence means is that Muggles have ideas that wizards sometimes like the look of. It doesn't say anything about the relative strength or utility of magic vs. technology as a medium for bringing those ideas to life.

2. None of the Muggle ideas utilised by wizards are really all that important to wizarding society. E.g. the sole purpose of the Hogwarts Express seems to be to provide the students with an opportunity to socialise. There are so many ways students could get to Hogwarts more efficiently using magical transport (e.g. Floo to Hogsmeade) yet they /choose/ the more inefficient method.

I'd say that they must be important enough if they have no problem taking inspiration from Muggle creations. The camera, radio, Express, etc were deemed important enough for wizards to make use of on a regular basis, and they were all created after the Statute was signed.

EDIT: Adding onto this, the Hogwarts Express was established pre-1830s, eight centuries after Hogwarts students had been Flooing, Apparating, Portkeying, or using Muggle transport to get to Hogwarts, and thirteen decades after the Statute was signed. The fact that the Minister at the time went to [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Ministry_of_Magic_operation_to_acquire_the_Hogwarts_Express][such lengths to acquire the Express]] despite the fact that several purebloods resented the idea, I'm going to say that the Express is pretty important. The usual magical solutions failed or were inconvenient (missed Portkeys and Portkey-sickness), so they turned to Muggle inventions, found a solution and modified them. The Hogwarts Express is a relatively new tradition, sure, but still a tradition.

They were. But then the Monarchy wouldn't help during the witch burnings. So they hid themselves. So they most likely still are a part of the government. Hell, the Minister of Magic talks to the Prime Minister regularly. Not to mention that some sort of cooperation is required from the muggle side. The Obliviators are efficient, but I can't see them obliviating half the countryside when a wizard gets arrested while drunk and shouting all sorts of stuff. Rumors spread fast. And then there's the fact that the vast majority of the magical population don't exist on the muggle side. Or how muggleborn and half-bloods disappear for chunks of the year starting at 11 and potentially disappear forever at 17.

Also, when in the course of human Events, it becomes necessary for one People to dissolve the Political Bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the Powers of the Earth, the separate and equal Station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, then the new regime continues with using the old law unless some specifics acts are rejected. The same applies to the Magical government splitting into a separate unit from the Muggle one (considering they are actually separate which at least mostly seems to be the case).

Therefore, all previous English laws should be valid in the Magical UK as well.

Therefore, specifically, the Magna Charta (including the right of everybody to “the lawful judgement of his peers or the law of the land”) and the Habeas Corpus Act of 1679, should be part of the law of the Magical UK.

Moreover, every civilized nation (including all of Europe since the Ancient Rome, specifically [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presumption_of_innocence][Wikipedia]] claims it was introduced to the Roman Law by the emperor [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoninus_Pius][Antoninus Pius]] in the second century AD) holds that “/Ei incumbit probatio qui dicit, non qui negat/” (“Proof lies on him who asserts, not on him who denies.”), meaning in our case that the Ministry (through DMLE I guess) has to prove Sirius Black's guilt, never he would have to prove his innocence (also, prove of negation is impossible).

Therefore, never in the course of events, Albus Dumbledore (among other positions, Chief Warlock, which I assume to be the highest officer of the law in the Magical UK) needed Peter Pettigrew to be caught to prove Sirius' innocence. He could just anytime it pleased him come to the nearest Auror or any other appropriate Ministry official and ask (as Chief Warlock) for the protocols of the trial with Sirius Black. When they couldn't be found, Sirius Black would be immediately free, no other questions asked.

What the hell he was thinking?!

  Sirius's face darkened. He suddenly looked as menacing as he had the night when Harry first met him, the night when Harry still believed Sirius to be a murderer.

  “Oh I know Crouch all right,” he said quietly. “He was the one who gave the order for me to be sent to Azkaban --- without a trial.”

  “What?” said Ron and Hermione together.

Also, if the SOS was implemented then the muggles forgot about the magicals. You can definitely secede if no one knows who you are and cannot enforce their laws upon you.

** quidditch. omg, I hate that. not only is it a very boring plot, the actual sport is bad, because it really only matters who catches the snitch anyway. there would be so much... soooo much time to add some actual magic in the books if just quidditch wouldn't exist. more lessons, more adventures... I think I only remember a single charms lesson from book one. JK loved quidditch and it shows as many points in the story were made around it. from cursed brooms to rouge bludgers. but really, I could live without it.

more school related plots, yeah, Voldy is important but the whole series didn't read much "school". what is actually taught in arithmancy and what kind of student Harry actually is, because he looks like a slacker to me. but then he makes an E in potions. and pretty much aces DADA.

house rivalry.

using wands/spells just like guns with no real magical stuff to happen. so you have practical spells, like reparo or alohomora, but when they duel it's boring. the only duel that was magical was Dumbles vs Voldy. any other duel is just sparks that either hit or miss, then sparks sending back, the AK is just a light that kills instantly. sorry, but crucio is pretty exciting in comparison with others. I wish every duel was like Dumbles/Voldy.

a lot of stupid mistakes and decisions. and while I'm able to stomach the ones made by children, the escape of wormtail was the stupidest and most preventable thing. at least Snape was unconscious. oh, maybe he needed to be so it could happen. but shouldn't Lupin actually realize, oh, Snape just said I forgot my potion. and it's full moon. heeeey, maybe I should stay in the shack just in case ya'll.

the existence of Dumbledore as mentor. so... wouldn't it be kinda more exciting if the kids actually found every secret by themselves? this series didn't need an all knowing mentor. and anyway, he didn't share his secrets at all. the only thing Harry needed him for was for the pensieve memories. at least he didn't have to have god-like properties. it irks me too much that he was able to see through the invisibility cloak, while it was supposed to be an ultra cool cloak from Death.

I hate how everyone always turns their back on Harry. especially Ron (4th book) and Seamus (5th book), but he was hated by the whole school in more than one book. it just gets to the point of "eh, this again"

** What bothers me a lot is the curriculum and its applications outside of school. I mean, we know that a lot of objects seems to be enchanted. There are protections around Hogwarts (I don't remember if the terms "wards" is canon). But where do they learn to do that in school?

Because if we observe canon, we have:

> Transfiguration which change the nature of things but doesn't particularly add any magical proprieties to it (apart failed transfiguration?).

> Herbology (so environment discovery and care, technically),

> Astronomy (which seems to be only about enjoying the night sky? While I understand the poetry of it, it doesn't seem to impact anything magical. Apart Divination?),

> History of Magic (so culture and learning of the past of the community. No magic involved),

> Potions (so mostly for "human" change? Maybe some potions can help with enchantment? Didn't see it in canon, I think?),

> Defense against the Dark Arts (which is for battle and pest control, for what we saw of it),

> Magical Creatures (also environment discovery and care),

> Arithmancy (I know that fanon like to improve it, but in canon, it is used for sorely for Divination. Why isn't it part of Divination, anyways, if it's its only use?)

> Divination (quite a controversy in it in canon, whether it can be real for anyone who doesn't have an affinity for it. But we have Astronomy and Arithmancy which seems to strengthen it, so it may be much more important than it seems, if it were for a decent teacher??)

> Muggle Studies (so discovery of another culture and maybe ways to adapt to it? Doesn't have many information on it, in canon)

> Ancient Runes (same as Arithmancy. This is what fanon use for enchantment. But then, in canon, this is just an ancient langage. As in Latin or Ancient Greek for us. Which is why an old children' book could be written in it and not be a magical item.)

> Charms (now that the most polyvalent one in canon. What is precisely Charms? Is it all the everyday magic? Is it also where they learn to enchant things? (after all, Animation charms on things are part of the exams) But if EVERYTHING is Charms, why not more hours of it? Is it that simple to learn??)

​

Anyways, I would have like more consistencies and precisions on every topics. Is enchantment Charms on objects? Even everlasting ones? What exacting is a Curse Breaker such as Bill? What skills does he need? I don't know, I just feel that it can be much more precise and thus immersive (well, fanfiction exists for a reason).

There's no rhyme or reason for them being in the order they are, in canon, and three of the origins for the objects are stupid. The Locket was created by killing “a muggle tramp” according to JKR. The Diadem was in Albania of all places, despite Ravenclaw's daughter living around England her whole life, and her being the one who hid it, and the one who told Riddle where to find it; and The Snake used to be a Human? What? Why!?

X---x---x----

Canon; The Diary, (The Cup, The Locket), The Snake, The Ring, The Diadem, The Skull. In That Order. Depending on who you ask, sometimes it's The Locket and /then/ The Cup. Also, sometimes The Ring is the 2nd one created, and sometimes it's the 5th. And sometimes The Diadem is the 4th, and sometimes it's the 6th. I've not seen it as the 5th, yet, though...

Fanon; The Diary, The Ring, The Diadem, The Cup, The Locket, The Skull, The Snake. Or, another way, Love, Family, Acceptance, Beauty, Sanity, Corporeality, Cunning.

A girl that loved him and his ability to Love for 1/2 of his soul in the Diary, his father and any blood Family through the ability to have children for 1/4 in the Ring, his old orphanage matron and Acceptance by society for 1/8 in the Diadem, the last of the Hufflepuff line and his beautiful face for 1/16 in the Cup, an unknown human sacrifice as well as his Sanity for 1/32 in the Locket, the (death) of his prophesied defeater and his Corporeality for 1/64 in the Skull (although the Cloak got in the way of that ‘death'), and Mrs. Bones, and the last major opposition to him in the DMLE and his Cunning for 1/128 in the Snake.

(Interestingly, the Diary also latches onto ginny's love for harry. Then there's dumble's wanting to use the Ring to see his sister again, and the Locket drives you slowly insane.)

No Wonder he just evaporated with only 1/128th of a soul, once the tethers were gone. Nobody killed him, in the end. The snake died, and he went /poof/ and lost the little anti-tug-of-war with harry, and just /dissolved away/ without anyone doing anything to him.

I won't stop Believing It, because it's my Headcanon, I can believe whatever I want; but I'll stop trying to argue it to you.

  "Tom Riddle hit the floor with a mundane finality, his body feeble and shrunken, the white hands empty, the snakelike face vacant and unknowing Voldemort was dead, killed by his own rebounding curse, and Harry stood with two wands in his hand, staring down at his enemy's shell."

He was hit by his own killing curse. His body was fully intact, just like everybody else killed by the same curse. His body dissolving into ash was added into the movie to make it more cinematic and dramatic.

I don't care if it's your headcanon. I mean, I think it's dumb, don't get me wrong, but I don't /care./ I will, however, if you state it as a fact in a thread meant for discussing canon, call you out on the fact that it /isn't/ canon and has /no basis/ in canon.

****** Everything below my note of “Fanon;” is Fanon. Headcanon. Would you like me to put in a dividing line, so that's easier to see? The Canon order is all over the place.

Sometimes it's Diary, Ring, Cup, Locket, Diadem, Snake, Harry.

Sometimes it's Diary, Ring, Locket, Cup, Diadem, Snake, Harry.

It's also sometimes Diary, Locket, Cup, Diadem, Ring, Snake, Harry.

Or Diary, Cup, Locket, Diadem, Ring, Snake, Harry.

And now I'm hearing back that apparently it's also, somewhere, Diary, Ring, Locket, Cum, Diadem, Harry, Sanke; but I don't where, I haven't seen that corroborated yet.

What I mean is, the Canon is All Over The Place. Do you want me to trust JKR's original statement, Pottermore, Wikipedia, the HP specific Wiki, JKR's more recent statements, Wizardingworld.com, or The-Leaky-Cauldron.org? Because NONE OF THEM AGREE!!!

  "'Then my mother fell ill - fatally ill. In spite of my perfidy, she was desperate to see me one more time. She sent a man who had long loved me, though I spurned his advances, to find me. She knew that he would not rest until he had done so.

  Harry waited. She drew a deep breath and threw back her head.

  'He tracked me to the forest where I was hiding. When I refused to return with him, he became violent. The Baron was always a hot-tempered man. Furious at my refusal, jealous of my freedom, he stabbed me.'

  'The /Baron?/ You mean-?'

  'The Bloody Baron, yes,' said the Gray Lady, and she lifted aside the cloak she wore to reveal a single dark wound in her white chest. 'When he saw what he had done, he was overcome with remorse. He took the weapon that had claimed my life and used it to kill himself. All these centuries later, he wears his chains as an act of penitence . . . as he should,' sure added bitterly.

  'And . . . and the diadem?'

  'It remained where I had hidden it when I heard the Baron blundering through the forest toward me. Concealed inside a hollow tree.'

  'A hollow tree?' repeated Harry. 'What tree? Where was this?'

  'A forest in Albania. A lonely place I thought was far beyond my mother's reach.'"

**** OP asked what bothers me the most about canon. That Does. Okay, so, who all was killed to create each Crux in canon? The Diary would be myrtel warren. The ring, Tom Riddle Sr. The Cup, Hepzibah Smith. The Locket, some no name muggle tramp (okay). The Snake, Unknown. The Skull (by that I mean Harry Potter, except for the odd fact that Harry is the only horcrux with a Mark showing it's creation. Even the Snake, the other living one, doesn't have a mark.), presumably Lily Potter's death?

It's too broken up. Who the heck cares about the random muggle tramp? What stake does Voldemort have in Lily's death (snape asking her to be spared)? There's no Canon statement for weather the Cup or the Locket was made first, they switch depending on who you listen too. Notably the Wiki and Pottermore disagreeing there. -And no, Nagini was made Before Harry, in canon-. Strike that, apparently quite a few sources are wrong. You're right on the tramp, aswell, I'll correct that.

X---x---x----

-Sorry for all the Wrong, Wrong, Wrong with my earlier statements. I'm not going to take them down, because I'm a strong believer in archiving everything, even mistakes, but it's since been clearly stated with quotes from the books what is right. I'm undoubtedly a billion words into the Fanfiction, so what is Canon and what is Fanon, I can never remember, and having the major sources disagree is no help at all.

Nope:

  "'However, if my calculations are correct, Voldemort was still at least one Horcux short of his goal of six when he entered your parents' house with the intention of killing you.

  'He seems to have reserved the process of making Horcruxes for particularly significant deaths. You would certainly have been that. He believed that in killing you, he was destroying the danger the prophecy had outlined. He believed he was making himself invincible. I am sure that he was intending to make his final Horcux with your death.

  'As we know, he failed. After an interval of some years, however, he used Nagini to kill an old muggle man, and it might then have occurred to him to turn her into his last Horcux.'"
#+end_quote

Half-Blood Prince, page 506

Presumably, the old muggle man was Frank Bryce, whom Voldemort murdered in the first chapter of Goblet of Fire, but it doesn't actually matter either way. Also, the Horcux in Harry's scar wasn't created deliberately and /wasn't fueled by a murder:/

#+begin_quote
  "'Tell him that on the night Lord Voldemort tried to kill him, when Lily cast her own life between them as a shield, the Killing Curse rebounded upon Lord Voldemort, and a fragment of Voldemort's soul was blasted apart from the whole, and latched itself onto the only living soul left in that collapsing building.'"
#+end_quote

Deathly Hallows, page 686

#+begin_quote
  "'You were the seventh Horcux, Harry, the Horcux he never meant to make. He had rendered his soul so unstable that it broke apart when he committed those acts of unspeakable evil, the murder of your parents, the attempted killing of a child. But what escaped from that room was even less than he knew. He left more than his body behind. He left part of himself latched to you, the would-be victim who had survived.'"
