** I wish there were more fics involving James and Lily. I think this would've been interesting though probably impossible. Another way to make immortality happen that ain't a horcrux for Harry would be awesome. Bonus if they /all/ had something for immortality and Harry can bring his parents back. It'd be super funny if Harry is Dumbledore's champion, finds out his immortal, finds out his parents are immortal, decides to bring them back but to /show/ Dumbledore not /tell/ Dumbledore what he's doing, and have James and Lily be like “what are you talking about?! We follow Voldemort!” And show Harry their Dark Marks. Or something like that, haha!

*** Sirius was like all other black i.e. dark. Moony being a ware wolf also sided with voldemort. Only Peter was the one who was light and betrayed their location to dumbledore.

**** Definitely. I can't image the Marauders (not counting worm obviously) on the same side!

*** Yes! Just yes! That would be hilarious and Dumbledore wouldn't know what to do at first. I mean what do you do when two people you thought dead are apparently alive, you sentenced their son to a living hell, and you apparently had two other traitors in your order.

**** I think it would be so funny! Epic plot twist for sure and Dumbledore would've been so blind-sighted. Even better if the newly resurrected couple went about changing all the views on the members of the Order of the Phoenix.

*** There was a fic I'd read a while back where it turned out either the Sorting Hat or Hogwarts Castle itself was a Soul Jar of Godric Gryffindor. "It's not a horcrux! It's a soul jar! My whole soul's in there; not a decaying, broken /piece/ of it!"

I can't recall what the fic was called, though

** Man, Dark Lily and James is such an underrepresented trope. I love those types of stories but there almost none out there!

(Does anyone by any chance know any such stories?)

  The Maruaders were not nice people, but what if the gang was as Dark as they should at first glance appear to be? AU Marauders era one-shot.
