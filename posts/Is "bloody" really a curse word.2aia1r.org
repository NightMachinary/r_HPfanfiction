Lots of fics keep having Hermoine scold Ron for using it, but I wonder if that's just fanon.


** It's a swear word, but no more offensive than crap and arse.

It's used for emphasis, being wry or disparaging, or for comedic effect. For example, "my dog shat on the rug" vs "my bloody dog shat on the rug". The first is kind of sad and impersonal, the second is exasperated-but-fond, and helps the person draw their own conclusions about the relationship between the dog and owner.

It's kind of a contradiction really, because bloody implies a lot. So "I had to get the bus this morning is a statement of fact- you did indeed get the bus, whilst "I had to get the bloody bus this morning" implies you got the bus, it was late as bloody usual, full of chavs, and the usual bloke that stank of piss sat right next to you. It adds context that it's a fondly loathed part of your day. A bit like your dog, which you fondly loath when he shits on the bloody rug for the third time this week.

***** I think you're right. From the [[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=bloody&searchmode=none][Online Etymology Dictionary]]:

#+begin_quote
  Old Engish blodig, adjective from blod (see blood). Common Germanic, compare Old Frisian blodich, Old Saxon bl√¥dag, Dutch bloedig, Old High German bluotag, German blutig.

  It has been a British intensive swear word since at least 1676. Weekley relates it to the purely intensive use of the cognate Dutch bloed, German Blut. But perhaps it ultimately is connected with bloods in the slang sense of "rowdy young aristocrats" (see blood (n.)) via expressions such as bloody drunk "as drunk as a blood."

  Partridge reports that it was "respectable" before c.1750, and it was used by Fielding and Swift, but heavily tabooed c.1750-c.1920, perhaps from imagined association with menstruation; Johnson calls it "very vulgar," and OED writes of it, "now constantly in the mouths of the lowest classes, but by respectable people considered 'a horrid word', on par with obscene or profane language."

  The onset of the taboo against bloody coincides with the increase in linguistic prudery that presaged the Victorian Era but it is hard to say what the precise cause was in the case of this specific word. Attempts have been made to explain the term's extraordinary shock power by invoking etymology. Theories that derive it from such oaths as "By our Lady" or "God's blood" seem farfetched, however. More likely, the taboo stemmed from the fear that many people have of blood and, in the minds of some, from an association with menstrual bleeding. Whatever, the term was debarred from polite society during the whole of the nineteenth century. [Rawson]

  Shaw shocked theatergoers when he put it in the mouth of Eliza Doolittle in "Pygmalion" (1914), and for a time the word was known euphemistically as "the Shavian adjective." It was avoided in print as late as 1936. Bloody Sunday, Jan. 30, 1972, when 13 civilians were killed by British troops at protest in Londonderry, Northern Ireland.

***** Lady = virgin Mary and/or Bloody Mary, both would be blasphemy because bloody Mary refers to Mary I who was head of church of England.

Dates better for Mary !. I see no reason for it to be the once virgin mother of Jesus.

** It's a mild curse but only kids get yelled at for it. The reason it's in the books so much is actually because JK wanted Ron to swear (properly like fuck and bollocks and things) but unfortunately the publisher didn't like it so made her use bloody.
