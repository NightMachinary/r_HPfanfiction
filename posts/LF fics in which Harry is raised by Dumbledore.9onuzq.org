** I can't think of the title, but the author "cuddlebearlove" has a good one. It was actually the first fanfiction I ever read back in 2004 maybe.

** There's an old one on ff.net, where they pass Harry of as Dumbledore's great nephew (?). Possible that it's been deleted, could not find it in quick search, will look some more.

Edit: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1124764/1/Web-of-Lies][Web of lies]], and it's not what you're looking for since it starts in year 4. Not sure why I remembered it as Dumbledore raising Harry.
