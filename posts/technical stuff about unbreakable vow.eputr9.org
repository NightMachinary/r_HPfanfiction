We know that breaking an Unbreakable Vow kills the person who broke it. I've looked everywhere but I haven't seen any other information regarding how the death happens. Is it quick and painless? Slow and agonizing? Kinda a discussion and also a bit for a small idea of mine.

Anyone have input?


** I've always imagined the vow to be tied to the soul or heart, so slow and agonizing would be my guess. Though the image in my head of Snape just falling down dead has me amused.

*** Now that would've been interesting. Would've depended on how long Narcissa intended the vow to last and what exactly counts as failing to protect Draco.

Makes sense to me too that it would be slow and painful. I've had the impression that Wizards take giving one's word very seriously.

** Nothing about it in canon, but I've seen it described a few ways. One person used it as the explanation behind spontaneous combustion.

*** Interesting... going based off of this and a previous comment here I'm getting ideas for a sort of autoimmune reaction. The person's magic attacks themselves, causing the spontaneous combustion or whatever gory death.

** I've always wondered if JK was using the word "kills" in a more metaphorical way? I could see a universe where the Unbreakable Vow doesn't kill a person but strips them of their magic, which most purebloods would view as true death, anyway. It seems like a custom that would only be popular with certain (pureblood) folks because of its magical significance.

*** That's an interesting thought... and it's giving me ideas :)
