Are there Fics that have Harry being around Epilogue age, so definetly older than at the end of the War, and traveling through Dimensions and he encounters a good Bellatrix?

She gets attracted to him and might even fall for him, but those feelings arent reciprocrated by him....either because of his experience with her in his own World or because he is already in a relationship or other reasons.

I leave it to the Fic, if it stays that way or if Harry at some point indeed develops feelings for her.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
