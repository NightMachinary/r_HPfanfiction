  HPLV. Harry Potter has been reborn again and again into new bodies as the Master of Death---but he has always helped to defeat Voldemort in each new world. Now his slightly older brother is the target of the prophecy, and Harry assumes his role is to support Jonathan. At least, that's what he thinks until Voldemort kidnaps him that Halloween night.

** I suspect it's hard to write a MoD!Harry that isn't shockingly overpowered, for the most part that seems to be the entire point of the MoD concept. Personally, I don't really mind it because I love reading overpowered characters.

With that in mind, I especially recommend October linkffn(10311215), which is certainly overpowered and surreal as hell but not crack;\\
Don't Fuck with Florists linkao3(7769080) kind of toes the line of crackish, but isn't quite;\\
Full Circle linkao3(6614155) is definitely weird but more humour than full-on crack, and is updated satisfyingly often;\\
Whispers in Corners linkao3(1134255) is a really good, non-OP non-crack MoD!Harry fic, but it /is/ a crossover with BBC Sherlock.

**** I'd recommend October mainly because I love everything that The Carnivorous Muffin writes, so I'm biased.

It's listed as a slash, but it really doesn't feel like it because there's no emphasis on it. Speaking as someone who doesn't read slash, I can tolerate it in this fic because it really isn't.

Though on another note, this fic can be summarised as "The Weird Life of Tom Riddle" and that MoD!Harry takes a supporting role in the story. Not sure if that is what people are looking for in this thread.

**** um actually I didn't even notice when I was listing them but yes I think they all are. That said, October only has the barest suggestion of a relationship, it's much more of a deeply existential look at MoD!Harry from Tom Riddle's perspective.

****** if you find you enjoy the writing style, you might like Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus linkffn(9911469) by the same author. It's a MoD!fem!Harry situation; it gets recommended fairly often on this sub but it does delve into the truly weird. This is an author who writes wholly entertaining and comprehensible crossover fanfics of crossover fanfics of her own fanfics; if you can get into it it's very worthwhile, but if you aren't inclined to take tangents and surrealism in stride it can be overwhelming. I didn't initially recommend this one because it's a much more blatantly powerful "Harry," but I'd say it's the better-known of the author's works. Plus, non-slash, though again the relationship is non-romantic enough to barely matter.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

  Unsatisfied with his post-war life, Harry decides to get to the root of all of his problems when that root was still working at Borgin and Burkes shop in the late 40s. He's the Master of Death, damn it, he can do what he wants for once in his life.Tom Riddle isn't particularly happy about working at a small, dingy shop for magical artifacts, no matter how interesting those artifacts are. He's even less happy when an insufferable stranger sets up the most obnoxious flower shop right across the street.What follows would be a romantic comedy, if it weren't for politics.

  (aka 'how to survive endless rebirth with your so-called soulmate')Harry and Tom's souls are tied together. Which is why they're in this endless loop of rebirth.

*** What I meant by brokeness, is like Thanos in the new Avengers [[/spoiler][who can just snap his fingers and everyone dies]]

I don't mind him being extremely strong, sort of like on that "Chrysoclorous" if you ever read this (its a x-over with Twilight) I just don't enjoy when he can do anything because he's essentialy god. Even if should make sense that he can.

I like when there's a relationship(not pairing) with Death, and he's not just his puppet or is all-around nice fairy god-mother.

The reason I asked without being crack is because mostly, i'm not a fan of humour in books. I like when it happens, but I don't actively search for it. When I read "A black Comedy", despite the title, it was suggested to me by my brother, saying it wasn't that funny but it was interesting. I laughed myself to tears, but it was unexpected.

Now that I think about it, non-jon is really great at humour, because Browncoat is also hilarious but with a good plot.
