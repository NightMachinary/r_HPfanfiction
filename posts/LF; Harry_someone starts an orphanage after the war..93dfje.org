Saw a post on fb where the head canon was that Harry started an orphanage, called it R.J Lupin House (if anyone else has seen that one) and I'm wondering if there is stories where someone starts an orphanage. Could be anyone, but he story has to be over 80k wording. Don't mind pairings, but don't want too much focus on the romance.

Thank you!


** Harry starts one in linkffn(Witches of Westfield)

It's harem though which I'm not usually a fan of but this one's pretty well written relatively speaking.
