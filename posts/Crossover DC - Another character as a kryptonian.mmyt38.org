This will probably be a weird request, but do you know those crossovers with characters of DC Comics that have Harry as a kryptonian or as descendent of one, like "Divided" by Lady Gallatea Ravenclaw, or "Kryptonian Mage" by CoastalFirebird?

Well, I'm trying to find a fanfic that has another character with kryptonian powers, like Hermione, or Neville, or other characters of the HP cast. They can be descendent of a kryptonian or a pure one, but I want them to still be someone in Hogwarts (How they have their magic doesn't matter... They could be a descendent of some magical deity withing the DC Comics, or just be a "kryptonian muggleborn", or any other way of giving them magic)

I would be very happy if there was one with Hermione being Superman's sister that ended up in England instead of the USA, with her recovering her true heritage while on Hogwarts or after the war.


** DC/Marvel crossover fics that don't star OP!Harry are rather frustratingly rare

** It would be good to have the Kryptonian as non-magical, since Superman is actually vulnerable to magic. I propose Filch.

  since Superman is actually vulnerable to magic

I thought that it was less him being vulnerable to it, and more him not having any extraordinary resistance to it.

** The Last Mage of Krypton series by TheBeardedOne has Harry being blood adopted as Harry but was born as Kal El. He does have magic but he is fully Kryptonian. 4 books covering the first four years. Complete and very fluffy. Had some interesting ideas. Not great but not bad at all.
