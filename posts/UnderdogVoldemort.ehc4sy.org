The Prophecy was heard before Harry was born, and with no parental figures to "get in the way" and a destiny that needed fulfilling, a slightly different Dumbledore has Harry trained to combat the Dark Lord and his forces from the moment he can stand all the way up to that fateful day in the graveyard. The Order never officially disbands and the Death Eaters are slowly picked off in their own mansions

Thus, Voldemort arises without his Horcruxes, the vast majority of his support base and, effectively, from step one all over again. All with a powerful foe in Dumbledore, a group of zealots (bordering on fanatic) in the Order intent on ensuring none of his plots can succeed or even get off the ground, and a nemesis far more powerful, knowledgeable and well versed than any teen has any right to be.

An intense thriller taking place, in its majority, from Voldemort's perspective where he starts out immediately on the back foot with absolutely no kind of advantage. Of the followers that are still alive they are either in Azkaban or unwilling to aide him from genuine fear of Dumbledore and the Order. Though the Ministry may deny his return (which keeps the Aurors and Hitwizards off his back) he has no footholds or spies he can use to sway policy or public opinion within the Ministry. But, somehow, the worst of all is Potter.

Relentless, like the Reaper itself, exploiting the connection they share. Tracking him down wherever he hid like some form of demented bloodhound. Never giving Voldemort the time to research and ascertain the nature of their connection and how to turn it off.

And he has goals to complete, desperately, as the Order bears down upon him:

▪︎ He needs more Horcruxes (he knows some of them are gone, but it is a process he cannot complete without the time to create them. Time Potter and the Order are not giving him)

▪︎ He needs followers (those he "knows" are still loyal are those who would rather throw away their freedom than denounce their allegiance. Thus he would have to infiltrate Azkaban... alone...)

▪︎ He needs the Prophecy (A risk all on its own. The Ministry refuse to accept his return and are outright denying it as truth. But without it, he does not have the full picture and does not know the full story. Infiltration of the Department of Mysteries could lead to him being exposed.)

A story where Voldemort is still evil, still ruthless and conniving and deadly, but made to work for it a little bit. A story where Voldemort, who lost to an actual baby 13 years ago, has to actually work for it to regain his status as a feared and respected Lord of the Darkness against the "insurmountable" forces of the Light.

** I know this isn't what you're looking for, but I think you'll like it:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13220537/104/A-Wand-for-Skitter][A Wand for Skitter]]: /Waking in the body of a murdered child, Taylor Hebert, once a supervillain and later a superhero must discover who has been killing muggleborns while being forced to go to Hogwarts, among groups who are the most likely suspects./

It's a crossover, and AU for HP, with Voldy beginning with more advantages than canon, but since he's going against someone who's an expert in this kind of thing it evens out into the underdog category.

** I am working on my own original story...so I don't want to be sucked into writing this as well... My two fanfiction stories are already in limbo as it is (I have some outline ready but not getting enough time to write). But this is a great idea. The idea of a mortal Voldemort, without his death eaters and everyone against him, going all out, first guerilla warfare style and then open war, made me shiver in anticipation for the story. Just imagine the new magic spells, his tactics, and his vengeance on those who deserted him. I read this prompt and immediately wrote a three page outline and idea list. Will post it here (for anyone to use) as soon as I figure out how to link a Google doc. Will probably do it within the week.

  He needs more Horcruxes
#+end_quote

Dumbledore already said Voldemort's soul was so unstable from so many horcruxes that he left another piece behind when he tried to kill Harry. He would most likely instantly die if he made more.

Anywho, math time!

Each horcrux making him more and more demented and insane. How much of his soul does he put into each one? There are fics where it says he puts 50% of the soul in his body into the item. And then something like him needing something like 10% of his soul anchored to be able to work. Otherwise they all poof when his body dies. I also like the caveat of magic being part of the soul, so he has all of his magic when his horcruxes are there, but when you start destroying them, you are magically weakening him.

- Diary: 50
- Ring: 25
- Locket: 12.5
- Cup: 6.25
- Diadem: 3.125
- Harry: 1.5625
- Nagini: 0.78125‬
- Soul in his body: 0.390625

***** Nagini was only made in GoF, with the death of either Bertha Jorkins or Frank Bryce (I'm not sure which, but I believe it was the latter). Harry was made in 1981 when the Killing Curse rebounded.

****** I'd say Bertha Jorkins, or someone else. I doubt that Voldemort would use the death of a worthless muggle to creat an horcrux.

All of his horcruxes are symbolic, and the deaths to create them were symbolic. It's fanon that he meant to use Harry for the last one, no?

Anyway, imo, this is what happened:

Myrtle (killed by the basilisk) - Diary (controls the basilisk)

Father (muggle, abandoned him) - Ring, an heirloom (a connection to his magical heritage)

The woman whose name I can't spell (descendant of Hufflepuff) - cup (artifact of Hufflepuff)

Bertha Jorkins (allows him to make a plan to regain his powers) - Snake (parsletongue, his unique power. The last horcrux, allowing him to reach the "ultimate" number of horcruxes and become "unbeatable")

Honestly, no idea about the diadem and the locket. Maybe an ex Hogwarts professor for the former, but he was traveling at the time, so he could've found anyone.

TL:DR I believe it's more likely the Voldemort used the death of Bertha Jorkins than that of Frank Bryce for his last horcrux.

#+end_quote

Just saying, the amount in Nagini and Voldemort has to be the same. You divided his soul too many times. If after Harry he has 1.5625 and then divides it in half, Nagini gets half of it (0.78125) and Voldemort gets half of it (0.78125).

Btw, I just noticed, they destroyed the horcruxes in the same order they were created! (I probably just found out something that has been common knowledge for ages...)

*** I like to think that souls do not follow logic. Soul can't be measured or weighed. It just IS. Each Horcrux is portion of Voldemort - immeasurable amount of his soul. It is abstract. It is magic. There is no gland, no muscle or organ in the body that houses the "soul".

Also personally I do not subscribe to the idea that his insanity is born from making Horcruxes. It just what he is as a person. Megalomaniac psychopathic narcissist.

As for why Harry became a Horcrux - Voldemort planned to make one that night + rebounding killing curse was the cause. It might very well be that in moment of killing Harry he was in the process of splitting his soul as well. Just didn't expect to be hit by his own curse.

**** Same. The idea that the Horcrux is half of his souls makes no anecdotes either, why out half your souls some where? Why not a tiny sliver, only enough to stop the rest from moving on after death.
