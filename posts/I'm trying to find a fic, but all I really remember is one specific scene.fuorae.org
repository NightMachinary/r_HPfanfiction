:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
The scene in question is one where Harry Potter is walking into the Ministry of Magic, with his girlfriend/wife (I'm pretty sure he was still a Hogwarts student, but I also think the word wife is more correct than girlfriend), and when he's asked for the reason of his visit, his response is along the lines of "to cause a scene," and I think he has a moment of amazement because he's actually presented with a badge/button to wear with his reason printed on it.

It might have been a crossover fic, but I honestly can't remember. Please help if ya can!


** I've read this fic or something similar and I cannot for the life of me remember. I'm pretty sure Dumbledore was with them as well.

*** Check with a browser instead.

Though I'm also confused as I see your original post and three comments and Reddit tells me there are six (not counting the one that I'm writing now).

EDIT : Apparently Reddit also counts some comments that are deleted, moderated, etc
