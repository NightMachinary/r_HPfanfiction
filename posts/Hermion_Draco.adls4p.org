I have always avoided this ship. But lately I have been thinking that a fic where she makes him realize the wrongness of his family teachings could be good.

Something like the two of them being forced in I don't know a detention? together (this has to has happen during 1st, 2nd or max 3rd year, after that even if he changes I don't think that an Hermione that's not completely OC would forgive him) and Draco slowly realising that his opinion on muggleborn his wrong. Insert A good internal conflict.

Then after they got together (can't be to fast, a canon Draco that changes his mind will refuse to admit it for quite some time in my opinion) they may try to keep it secret? Conflict with friends for both? Draco's family could make everything more interesting?

Naturally then the canon storyline will have to go AU and that if well made it could become interesting.

Basically I am looking for a story were the turning point from canon his that Draco gets out of his father shadow early on. With no OC characterisation o canon characters. No order forced drama, even better if the ship is not the only focus point of the fic.

Seeing that the ship is so popular I am sure some fics that are like I described exist, any recommendations?

Ps. Not a native English speaker, please forgive any grammatical mistake

** linkffn(6291747)

I know it's been mentioned and this happens 7th year, not 1-3, but trust me this is worth it. I don't think it's OOC (well, beyond the eventual non-cannon D/Hr pair) but it hits all the notes you outlined. It's a slow burn, but it's extremely well written. You get both sides of the story which is pretty refreshing considering most D/Hr redemption arc stories don't shed light on Draco's perspective and why he has those beliefs.

So if you can't find something with that plot but set early on, I suggest reading [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6291747/1/Isolation][Isolation]] by Bex Chan.

*** I second this. It's probably the only D/Hr fic that could be called realistic due to the slow-burn approach and the specific circumstance. The writing is very good from a technical standpoint, and having it be from both points of view definitely helps.

**** I would recommend the author lena phoria too you.. very few great D/HR writers.. but imo right up there with bex-chan... Now all of her stuff is post hogwarts and have very adult themes but fantastic...she has several fanfictions up on ffnet A but her best fanfiction "Cruel and beautiful world" was taken down because she converted the story to an actual book but if you search the title and her name you should be able to find a copy... It is easily in my top 5 fanfictions

,(her books based on it was real good too... Right now on amazon first 2 are free for Kindle, and 3rd one is on sell for $5)

  3 years after the war Hermione takes a break from Ron and accepts a summer job collecting supplies for Ollivander's wands. What she doesn't expect is having to work with Draco Malfoy, who's more haunted by his past than she ever would have believed. Together they will travel the world, fight dragons, conquer demons and maybe find exactly what they're looking for. COMPLETE.

** I'll agree Isolation is good, but for a believable war (post-Hogwarts) DHr fic I prefer The Fallout by everythursday linkao3(10620276) (note that it's not marked as complete but it actually is)

Edited to add: Here's the actual summary for The Fallout - "Hermione learns about growing up through the redemption of Draco Malfoy."

There's not a whole lot of Dramione's that cover all of the Hogwarts Years, majority of them are set post-OotP, but here's a few that I know of:

A cute little oneshot that goes through the Hogwarts years is Under the Lights by silver.ink13 linkffn(7675327)

A popular Dramione fic is The Green Girl by Colubrina linkffn(11027125) with a Slytherin!Hermione

The Brightest Black by enigmaticrose4 linkffn(11845481) has a Hermione and Harry raised by Sirius

These last two I haven't read but I've heard about them in the DHr community:

Remembering You by pinayflava90 linkffn(6565033)

Children of the Dark series by cleotheo, here's the first one linkffn(11301204), the rest of the years can be found on the author's profile
