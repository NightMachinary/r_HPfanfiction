** I love this. Would be a fun way to incorporate and develop Charlie Weasley as a character. Maybe he has to ride/fly next to Norberta on her migrations because they usually accompany Norwegian Ridgebacks as they migrate to Norway every year but since Norberta goes to Hogwarts, Charlie is selected as her personal escort. Could also introduce Tonks into the series earlier by having her come back to Hogwarts to see Charlie.
