** I see you haven't been around career politicians too much, or have been exceedingly lucky.

Umbridge knows with who she can be abrasive and who she can't, unlike Draco who apparently has no tact, she knows to at least hold herself.

** Our current two presidential candidates are Donald Trump (no further words are necessary), and guy who palled around with segregationists, calls voters jackasses, and is constantly telling people to vote for someone else if they don't like his policy.

I'd say it's more a question of whether any politicians are pleasant, rather than the contrary.
