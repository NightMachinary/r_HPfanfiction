Please recommend me something like that. The only fic i have in my mind is linkffn(again and again by athey)

Thank youu


** These are both self-inserts, which I know isn't for everyone but they might fit your request.

Linkffn(The Bigger Picture by black9) The writing in this is a bit odd(?) I found it easier to read if I wasn't paying attention to it too much, but the plot and use of magic is really enjoyable. The mc isn't super concerned with manipulating the plot, he's more into understanding magic and learning cool things and only very occasionally interferes.

Linkffn(Accio Butterflies by tearlessNevermore) is quite fun and the mc doesn't really want to do anything himself, he just wants to play with cool magic and do fun stuff.

  Dropped alone in a world of magic that seems strangely familiar, I must take up arms to save the day-or I could just tell Dumbledore and let him deal with it? Yeah, I prefer that idea. A Harry Potter Self-Insert fic.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp
