Pretty much exactly what the title says. How do you think wizards investigate crimes? Not Death Eater killing sprees, but the average robbery, mugging, or heat of the moment murder. Spells that determine recent movement of people? Some kind of DNA analysis potion? Rely primarily on witness and victim statements? Are wizarding arrest rates really bad because magic makes it easier to get away with a crime?

I want to hear everything from the plausible to the outrageous.


** My Auror OCs usually use a mix of mundane and magical ways. Interrogating witnesses (maybe with using pensieves), checking for clues, analysing spell traces and other evidence, etc., and trying to use logic to exclude polyjuice and similar means. I assume that while magic offers more options to conceal a crime, it also offers more options to detect a crime, so it evens out more or less.

*** That stuff is really cool, but why not just feed all the suspects veritaserum? Failing that, have their interrogations done by Legilimens. Most fictions tend to put legal roadblocks into these though.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1795399/1/Resonance][Resonance]] is a fiction where Harry Potter is an auror trainee and they use spells in training to detect where people move and for tracking them. Granted in that fiction they don't do much investigating.

Really though, with the number of ways to determine if someone is lying or not using canon harry potter magic... the problem investigators would be solving is /finding//identifying the suspects. Once the suspect is found, baring some legal roadblock they can be fed truth serum and subjected to master Legilimens interrogation. Truth and guilt is easy to find given you have the person at hand.

A side note, I have never seen anyone take a wand at the crime scene and show it to Ollivander. After all, the man remembers every wand he has ever sold.

/After the greasly murder of 4 children... Junior Auror Potter discovers a 13 inch oak wand at the scene of the crime. Following ministry procedure he tags and bags the wand and returns it to the office. Shacklebolt later takes the wand to Ollivander to discover the name of the prime suspect./

/Now Harry Potter is given his first major assignment, track down the owner of this wand./

Yes I'm a horrible writer!

**** But even if there is a very malleable "reasonable suspicion for the use of veritaserum" clause, they need to have a suspect first. And polyjuice and memory charms further make this solution less than perfect.

***** Yea. Once you have someone in custody, it is trivial to prove guilt. Getting that person in custody is the tricky part given people can straight up teleport from place to place. Look at how hard it was to get Harry in book 7. They evaded capture for months!
