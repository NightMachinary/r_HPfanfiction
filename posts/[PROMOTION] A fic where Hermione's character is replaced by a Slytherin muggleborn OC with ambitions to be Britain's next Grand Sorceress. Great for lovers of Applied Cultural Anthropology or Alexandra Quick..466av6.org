linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11280068/1/The-Brightest-Witch-and-the-Darkest-House]]) and the updating sequel linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11677935/1/The-Hogwarts-Six-and-The-Darkest-Wizard]])

This fic stars OC Valeria Campbell, a muggleborn Slytherin witch, Daphne Greengrass, Tracey Davis, and their adventures through Hogwarts with Harry, Ron, and Neville. Highlights include- a ruthless, brilliant protagonist who uses Dark Arts to help Harry, a intra-Slytherin feud between Malfoy and Campbell (first muggleborn in Slytherin in awhile), an interesting Muggle family (diplomat mother, older fantasy-roleplaying brother whose ideas about magic can be useful), HUGELY creative use of canon spells, NO Stations of the Canon, pureblood politics, and teenage witches/wizards who often fail but are working their butts off to get better before Voldemort fully returns. Adults aren't useless here either. Fight scenes are well-done.

If you like Alexandra Quick or ruthless!Hermione, you will love this OC. Hermione does NOT exist in this fic, but OC has many of her characteristics (academic workaholic, etc.), just with personal ambition replacing Hermione's social justice aims and rule-abiding nature.

Example of creative canon usage: Valeria Campbell uses unicorn blood to poison and permanently curse someone incompetent in the Ministry. And that's a minor example. Check this fic out! Fourth year is being currently updated.


** It's not bad, I'm following the sequel now. Valeria gets too powerful a little too quickly, but that'll always be a problem with this sort of story. Don't worry, it's nowhere near Super!Harry, plus she faces bigger social challenges than Harry, being in Slytherin. She doesn't seem Self-Inserted at all; her brother, a minor at best character, is the only character who seems to have been influenced a lot by real life.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

** Looks promising; will read. I've always thought that it wouldn't take much of a tweak for Hermione to go to Slytherin in the first place. Say, if she runs into Draco on Hogwarts Express, he says something bigoted, or goes after Neville, or something like that, and they get in a shouting match that becomes a fight (as much as two pre-first-years can have a fight) that has to be broken up by Prefects. Still seething, she puts on the Hat, and then it's "Well, it looks like your heart's greatest desire is to make purebloods acknowledge how much better than them you are in every way, and, in particular, crush Draco Malfoy. Have fun in SLYTHERIN!"

I wonder how the fic would read if one actually replaced Valeria with Hermione, brother with cousin, and made a few other tweaks to make it more canon-consistent and to justify Hermione being a little more selfish than in canon (or maybe make it an explicit point of divergence).

Also, about the OP,

#+begin_quote
  Hermione's ... rule-abiding nature.
#+end_quote

Can we please let the RuleAbiding!Hermione fanon die, already? Please? Even early-canon Hermione only looks oh-so-rule-abiding because Harry and Ron act like rules don't exist and have very little impulse control, whereas Hermione actually weighs the consequences of her actions. (Worth noting is that whereas Harry and Ron take for granted their connections to the magical world, for Hermione, expulsion may well mean no more access to magical education in the first place.)

Right. But, how is that different from Valeria? Would Hermione really hesitate to break rules that Valeria breaks if placed in Valeria's situation?

(Also, it started long before Heir of Slytherin. How much did she hesitate before lying to McGonagall about why she was in the toilets with the Troll, or before setting a teacher on fire during Harry's first Quiddich game? Canon Hermione is more ruthless than Harry, Ron, and Draco combined --- and she only shows remorse once, after she modifies memories of her own parents.)

#+begin_quote

Maybe, but I doubt it: Harry doesn't really think of consequences much. Does he even think /once/ about the consequences of expulsion before Aurors show up to snap his wand in OotP?

I'll grant that Valeria is a bit more adventurous than Hermione, who'd probably take fewer risks and reap fewer rewards, but looking at the author's notes, it sounds like Belial has fully bought into the AuthorityWorshipper!Hermione fanon.

***** I don't think it's a character flaw, but I do think Hermione would read something about Dark Magic, read the definition of dark magic, think 'that sounds dangerous', and steer clear of it. Hermione is more cautious and I've never got a sense that she's personally ambitious the way Slytherins are. I don't think she would have fit into Slytherin because she has too much devotion to fair play and justice and she thinks people in charge think the same way as she does until she's given really good reasons not to think that.

I mean, she was defending Snape as a teacher in first year just because he was a teacher. She's not naturally suspicious and she's morally upright and I think it was a compelling reason to not call this MC Hermione, because Hermione would be OOC then.

Valeria breaks rules without thinking about whether or not her goal is righteous enough to excuse her rule breaking. Hermione does think about that. They're just different people. Oh and yeah, Hermione would probably not do necromancy to recruit spies or keep Pettigrew around just to learn from him once she caught him. Hermione kept Skeeter in a jar, yeah, but she didn't feed her friendship potion and squeeze her for information- I think that would've been too exploitative for her. I read Valeria as a Slytherin whose secondary house is Ravenclaw, and Hermione's pretty similar as a Gryffindor whose secondary is Ravenclaw, but there are lines Hermione won't cross because of her morals that Valeria would.

Touché on your thoughts about Harry, very good point.

****** Before the reply about the specific points, the way I see it, the author had a choice:

1. Create a "Valeria" personality and call her "Hermione".

2. Tweak some elements to Hermione's background or experiences to make her Slytherin-ambitious (described below) enough to be sorted into Slytherin (which isn't hard) and have her adapt to her highly unpleasant circumstances by becoming more casually ruthless.

3. Create an OC.

Option 1 would, indeed, be outright OOC, and I deeply respect the author's honestly in not taking that option.

Option 2 and 3 have their costs and benefits. Option 3 is easier but less elegant and many readers have an instinctive revulsion to an OC (which is often justified, though I'm OK with thsi one). Option 2 is more elegant but constrains what Hermione could do and when, both because of who her parents are and because, like you say, she needs a lot more justification before she does "dark" things. Rather than quickly getting into things like Valeria torturing Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle with the Boils Potion, Hermione would try to be nice first, probably engaging in a more gradual escalation.

Either option is valid. However, my impression from the author's notes is that that decision had been made under the influence of bad fanon: the distance between Valeria and Hermione isn't as big as the author appears to have thought, and contrary to what the author writes in summaries and author notes, Valeria is not anti!Hermione. The perpetuation of fanon kind of grates.

On to more specific items:

#+begin_quote
  I don't think it's a character flaw, but I do think Hermione would read something about Dark Magic, read the definition of dark magic, think 'that sounds dangerous', and steer clear of it.
#+end_quote

I do agree that she wouldn't be as casual about it as Valeria: Hermione might read enough about it to be familiar with it, and she might use it to solve a sufficiently big problem, but she probably wouldn't proactively explore it or use it lightly.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione is more cautious and I've never got a sense that she's personally ambitious the way Slytherins are.
#+end_quote

I agree about that. The way I see it, Hermione is Gryffindor-ambitious: she wants to make the world a better place, whether the world wants it or not; whereas a Slytherin-ambitious person would want personal power, wealth, influence, or just creature comforts. (Remember that Dumbledore was /beginning to plan to take over the world for the Greater Good/ when he was Sorted into Gryffindor.) That said, Hermione isn't Slytherin-unambitious personally. She /loves/ to show off, to be admired as the smartest person in the room. In other words, the seeds of Slytherin-ambition are certainly there.

#+begin_quote
  I don't think she would have fit into Slytherin because she has too much devotion to fair play and justice and she thinks people in charge think the same way as she does until she's given really good reasons not to think that.
#+end_quote

I certainly don't think she'd fit in well, /but neither does Valeria/. Whether she'd make others make room for herself, that's a different question. After all, what constitutes "fair play" is pretty flexible (after all, if someone is playing unfair, nothing wrong with playing unfair twice as hard, right?), and justice is an end, not the means --- and for canon Hermione, the end /does/ justify the means. (For that matter, Valeria does care about justice quite a lot.)

#+begin_quote
  I mean, she was defending Snape as a teacher in first year just because he was a teacher.
#+end_quote

Was it because he was a teacher? What passage is that?

Either way, she didn't hesitate to set him on fire when she thought he was up to no good, and she was right about him not being the Big Bad in the book, so there's that.

#+begin_quote
  She's not naturally suspicious and she's morally upright
#+end_quote

Hermione's suspicious enough of /Dumbledore/ in PS. She's morally upright when it comes to her ends, and she likes to pick her battles (and can afford to, being in Gryffindor and having pretty reliable friends), but her /means/ are very flexible. This is not that different from Valeria.

#+begin_quote
  and I think it was a compelling reason to not call this MC Hermione, because Hermione would be OOC then.
#+end_quote

See above.

#+begin_quote
  Valeria breaks rules without thinking about whether or not her goal is righteous enough to excuse her rule breaking. Hermione does think about that. They're just different people.
#+end_quote

Well, Valeria isn't a sociopath, so certainly she would be averse to, say, outright murder and weigh it against the benefits, so I don't think that that's exactly right. As I see it, it's a matter of degree.

#+begin_quote
  Oh and yeah, Hermione would probably not do necromancy to recruit spies or keep Pettigrew around just to learn from him once she caught him.
#+end_quote

Here's what I found disturbing about that bit: all of her other friends were perfectly OK with what they did with Pettigrew. However, it's also worth noting that Valeria lives in a darker universe than canon Hermione, with darker friends and day-to-day enemies and Darker magic being more easily available, in all evidence. (It's one of those Everyone's More Badass 'verses.)

#+begin_quote
  Hermione kept Skeeter in a jar, yeah, but she didn't feed her friendship potion and squeeze her for information- I think that would've been too exploitative for her.
#+end_quote

Unctuous Unction only appears in the video games, so blackmail may well have been the best that book-Hermione could do short of an Imperius. (Also, doesn't UU require the person to take it continuously, lest it wear off? More practical for a captive rat animagus than for a reporter who needs to be out there to be useful.)

#+begin_quote
  I read Valeria as a Slytherin whose secondary house is Ravenclaw, and Hermione's pretty similar as a Gryffindor whose secondary is Ravenclaw, but there are lines Hermione won't cross because of her morals that Valeria would.
#+end_quote

Hard to say. Hermione certainly has a higher threshold for using evil means to achieve her ends, but I think that it's a matter of degree.

#+begin_quote
  Touché on your thoughts about Harry, very good point.
#+end_quote

The question was semi-rhetorical. Just because neither of us can remember doesn't mean that it never happened, but, yeah, Harry doesn't have the temperament to think things through. (I think that fics often conflate that with intellectual independence, but that's a separate discussion.)

** Finished what's written so far:

*The good:* Well written, interesting, imaginative storyline, with the author who is paying attention, with Stations of Canon not visited unless justified. Interesting, creative use of magic that isn't OP. The OC isn't a Mary Sue, and, in fact, the main cast is quite well balanced. (Everybody, good and bad, have their flaws.) Not a fixfic: replacing Hermione with Valeria makes things better in some ways, worse in others.

*The bad:* Nonverbal and wandless casting comes too easily to too many characters at too young an age. Lots of fanon, some of it bad --- and I wish the author didn't make such a point about only using canon magic when going so far beyond it --- and unjustified digs at canon [1] but, funnily enough, most of it is concentrated in the author's notes, and the fic isn't degraded by it, even if the author perpetuating the fanon grates.

*Overall:* A very good read, with relatively few annoyances. Strongly recommended, with mild reservations.

[1] E.g., Hermione worships authority (fanon, which doesn't appear in the fic only because Hermione's been replaced); Dursleys starved Harry (as opposed to overfeeding Dudley) and abused him physically (fanon), and therefore McGonagall and Pomfrey are to be faulted for not spotting signs of starvation and physical abuse (unjustified dig at canon).
