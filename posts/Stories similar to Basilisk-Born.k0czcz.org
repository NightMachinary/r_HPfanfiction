I am looking for stories like Basilisk-Born that involve Harry being an ancient learned wizard or going back in time and becoming one of the known historical powerhouses like the founders, and then going back to his time somehow. I also love that he is primarily a healer in Basilisk-Born but that is secondary.


** The Shadows of Angmar, quite different (especially since it's a crossover HP/LOTR) but so good.

*** How much do you have to know about LOTR to read that? I never really got into LOTR (though that could just because I was younger at the time) so it's harder for me to read something that requires you to know a lot about that universe.

**** I don't think you need to know the books for that, since you follow Harry and he is completely lost in this new world, so he discovers everything and everything he doesn't know is explained to him

**** Honestly it's hard to tell because while I have read all the LOTR books a lot of what happens takes place before the hobbit and explains itself fairly well. I don't think me reading the Simarillion mattered too much.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

** linkao3(11284494), [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/755028][Of A Linear Circle series]]. I started with [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11631114/chapters/26156739][Part 3]] though as it starts with Harry's timetravel. Harry travelled back in time to 990. He lived there until 1017 (so he's 42) and then is preserved via a portrait until the Halloween of 1995. He lived all this time in Slytherin Common Room and knows all the Slytherins (and some of them know him). It's interesting to see his interactions with people who graduated long ago. Aberforth, for example. He even remembers when Albus sneaked into Slytherin rooms one night to see his boyfriend and remarks that he was almost caught. The series is /very/ interesting and intriguing, and I love Harry and Salazar being brothers.

linkffn(2651376), Voldemort's Last Spell. It's exactly what you want. Infant Harry is thrown back in time to when people lived in tribes. He doesn't know that he's from the future and is raised in one of the tribes. When others start to get uncomfortable by his suspiciously long life, he travels. He's immortal and ancient. It also got updated and finished this June, wow.

  Pursued by Death Eaters while the Wizarding war rages on, Harry is thrown a thousand years into the past, leaving his friends to lead the fight against Voldemort's growing forces. Lost in an unfamiliar world, he meets a legend. He discovers the man behind it. And from there, everything changes.

*** Voldemorts last spell was okay until chapter 9 or so when it became a crossover, but by chapter 11 I had to stop because it turned into a horrible and badly written crack did. Next I will read the Linear Circle series.

**** I have to agree with you. Chapters 1 - 10 were written in 2008. After chapter 10, the story went on hiatus for 12 years. Chapter 11 onward were written in 2020, and after trying to read those chapters and giving up after chapter 12, I will say he should have just left the story as is. Not only does it seem to have devolved into a bad crack fic after chapter 10, there are authors notes within the story, and in a lot of places, it sounds like the author is just rambling, without really saying anything of substance in regards to the story. It almost seems like it was written by two different people. If anyone is planning to read Voldemort's Last Spell, I recommend you only read to the end of chapter 10.

  Living for a century is an accomplishment, even for a wizard. Two is a rarity. Living them all? That is the territory of the gods. Harry Potter remembers a cat's glowing eyes, a strange old man with a wicked smile, and pain. It is the year 3050 B.C.E. and he has all of history as his future.
