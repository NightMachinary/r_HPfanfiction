It was an 8th year Drarry fic where Lucius was sent to Azkaban, and Harry finds out Malfoy's been practicing his patronus so he can send his father a message. Harry helps him and they eventually fall in love and stuff. I think (but I'm not sure) that they end up having sex in the old Ford Anglia and that Draco also spent the summer helping rebuild Hogwarts. It was definitely E or M rated. It was a fairly popular fic on Ao3 but I can't find it anywhere, I don't know if maybe it's been deleted? Any help would be great :)


** I know I've read this one as well, but can't remember the title. Maybe something by Lomonaaeren? You may get an answer if you ask over on [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]].
