Imagine a bored deity, or Fate or something else decide to put you in the Harry Potter universe starting Hogwarts the same year as him, and a muggle born in England. What would you do? You can't ignore Voldy and his minions because as a mud... muggle born they won't ignore you.


** Well, I don't have to ignore them as a muggleborn I just have to delay them.

Truth is I'd fess up to Dumbledore as soon as possible. He is not half as bad as most fanfiction implies he is. Trust him to act on all the horcruxes or merely delay Voldemort for as long as possible. Then as I'm stuck as an 11 year old muggleborn, I'd probably go into Hufflepuff just to keep my head down until I'm 17 and move back to my home country. If shit hits the fan I'll provide shelter/smuggling for other muggleborn from Britain.

** Realistically, I would practically devour any and all knowledge regarding magic that I could get my hands on, because holy shit look what I can do now.

Edit: Also, I would like it on record that I'm pretty sure that if any deity were to pluck someone from our reality and drop them into the Harry Potter universe for shits and giggles, it'd be Tzeentch.

** Of course I can ignore him, jesus christ I'd basically be a kid, only dumber because usually kids know most of what they grew up with. I'll probably wait until the baddies come out publically and then transfer somewhere far, far away. Like Canada. I'd finish my education there.

Like hell I'm gonna fight for anyone or anything while not even a teenager yet.

Maybe, possibly, I'll send someone important a note of all the relevant canon details, but apart from that I'm choosing the best defense: obscurity.

** *Step 0: Freak right the f**k out*\\
Completely lose my sh*t over the fact that I may never see any of my friends or family again.

*Step 1: Make contact with Andromeda Tonks*\\
She's practically guaranteed to be on the right side and not totally up Fudge's or Dumbledore's arse, while also having a good lay of the land socially/politically. As a Slytherin raised in the Black family, she's also likely to have at least some competence at intrigues.

*Step 2: Send an info-dump to the right person/people*\\
Use Andromeda's knowledge to figure out who those people are. If Dumbledore is consistent with canon and/or one of his other more competent and benevolent depictions, he'd be the first choice. Certain other people might also be worth bringing in: Alastor Moody and Amelia Bones are both good choices, as is Kingsley Shacklebolt, assuming they're as depicted in canon and not attached to a problematic Dumbledore. Whoever it is, get them pointed at the problem with as much useful intel as I can provide.

*Step 3: Prepare*\\
Assume that adults in the Potterverse are going to do what they all do in canon, i.e. nothing useful or helpful, and begin preparing for the inevitable shitstorm. Start arranging routes by which fellow Muggle-borns (plus Half-bloods and non-dark Purebloods) can flee Britain. Encourage decent people to get ready to either fight or escape. Learn defensive magic. Learn warding and enchantment, and try applying a bit of creativity and engineering to magic - use a lightning spell to power a man-portable railgun, for example, or investigate how shrinking/enlarging spells impact momentum and kinetic energy; Potterverse magic seems to have loads of potentially abusable spells.

*Step 3.5: Enjoy it while I can*\\
Fly on a broom. Learn and use magic. See awesome magical creatures. Explore Hogwarts. Befriend Neville, and later Luna, and do my best to keep the non-faculty bullies off their backs.

** I would do like Hermione+10 and grind the system for knowledge, especially combat magic, and then seek arcane, old knowledge, learn Occlumency and if I saw things were getting really bad, I would just move to America or something, after writing Dumbledore the locations of all Horcruxes, and how to destroy them.

Voldemort always seemed to me as a local threat, I doubt he could actually succeed in a country without the blatant corruption, incompetence, and racism as Wizarding Britain has. What he was selling was much more niche than Grindelwald`s proposals.

Probably want to be sorted to Ravenclaw(neutral-ish, less attention, but with access to Flitwick for dueling tutoring), but might end up in Slytherin because no matter how many of those tests I do I can`t get anything else.

****** Hermione rarely ever found important stuff in the library, I mean she looked for Nicholas Flamel, arguably the greatest Alchemist to ever live and found nothing.

IIRC correctly she didn't look in the restricted session. I just think Occlumency is obscure enough there's nothing in the library about it. We never read anything about the Ministry restricting it.

And Snape was a poor teacher at anything, /especially/ to Harry, honestly, in some of the latter books, I totally understand why some writers make Dumbledore to be intentionally making Harry suffer.

** I would stay low and do nothing until I somehow manage to get a better grasp of the situation. Sure, we have some useful knowledge, but nothing that really help us survive if shit hits the fan. We only see the world from Harry's eyes, and I am sure that there is a lot of crime and abuse going on in Hogwarts.

As a muggleborn, I would wait and see how my first year passes. Learn everything I can while being completely average. I wouldn't even go to the room of lost things to plunder galleons since the twins or Harry may see me with the map - that would just make them go and question me what I am doing. Dumbles would sooner or later step in and I am caught in their game as a front soldier/ cannon fodder.

The problem is that as a muggleborn, without any protection - such as Hermione had it in from of the fame of Harry - you are screwed if you attract the attention of any nasty purebloods like Draco. I think I cant even go to Dumbles without losing my freedom due to the info about the future I have inside my head. The ministry itself is also damn corrupt and secrets don't stay secrets for long. The moment someone (purebloods, authority figures) wants something from me, as muggleborn, I am fucked.

So, my guess is that the first two years will be pretty boring. I would stay low and observe, learn, and adapt. The third-year is a good time to try to steal the map, maybe? But the best time to get active would be the fourth yeat. It's the most hectic time and nobody will pay much attention to me when I sneak into the room of lost thing to plunder it of anything valuable I will then sell to the goblins/ second-hand shops/ or whatever.

Ps: I may or may not visit Little Hangleton to switch the bones of riddles father with the bones of some old grandma that I previously prepared with radioactive substances - or whatever. Its a risk, however. One can never know if Voldy didnt install some safety measures around.

** After the Train Ride I immediately tell a teacher that I have to inform Dumbledore of something extremely important, they wont let me talk to him, but when the Sorting Hat reads my mind I dont want it to look like I tried to keep all my knowledge a secret. Then when it does read my mind it hopefully tells Dumbledore that it urgently needs to talk to him with me being there, then I tell them literally everything I know of canon, but most importantly that Quirrel is currently possessed by Voldemort, that Voldemort made multiple Horcruxes and their locations(two of which are in the castle at the moment) and that he should kill Harry now, before he starts caring for him too much, like in canon.

With Voldemort probably dealt with, I'd like to get a magical education, and while it would probably be considered weird to have me attend classes with children ten years younger me, Dumbledore would most likely insist that I live in the castle, since the knowledge I hold is considerably more valuable then even Trelawney.

***** I always thought that had nothing to do with it and that Harry simply had one extra life. The only effect of the ritual was that the Blood Protection wouldn't hurt Voldermort anymore.

JKR was never very deep about that part, and left much leeway for the specifics of why Harry survived, some say it was because at that point in time he was the owner of all Three Hallows and/or was holding the Ressurection Stone.

It could be said it was because Voldermort himself shot the spell, going full circle.

  â€˜But if Voldemort used the Killing Curse,' Harry started again,

  â€˜and nobody died for me this time -- how can I be alive?'

  â€˜I think you know,' said Dumbledore. â€˜Think back. Remember

  what he did, in his ignorance, in his greed and his cruelty.'

  568 HARRY POTTER

  Harry thought. He let his gaze drift over his surroundings. If it

  was indeed a palace in which they sat, it was an odd one, with

  chairs set in little rows and bits of railing here and there, and still,

  he and Dumbledore and the stunted creature under the chair were

  the only beings there. Then the answer rose to his lips easily,

  without effort.

  â€˜He took my blood,' said Harry.

  â€˜Precisely!' said Dumbledore. *â€˜He took your blood and rebuilt*

  *his living body with it! Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lily's*

  *protection inside both of you! He tethered you to life while he*

  *lives!'*

  â€˜I live ... while he lives? But I thought ... I thought it was the

  other way round! I thought we both had to die? Or is it the same

  thing?'

  He was distracted by the whimpering and thumping of the

  agonised creature behind them and glanced back at it yet again.

  â€˜Are you sure we can't do anything?'

  â€˜There is no help possible.'

  â€˜Then explain ... more,' said Harry, and Dumbledore smiled.

  â€˜You were the seventh Horcrux, Harry, the Horcrux he never

  meant to make. He had rendered his soul so unstable that it broke

  apart when he committed those acts of unspeakable evil, the

  murder of your parents, the attempted killing of a child. But what

  escaped from that room was even less than he knew. He left more

  than his body behind. He left part of himself latched to you, the

  would-be victim who had survived.

  â€˜And his knowledge remained woefully incomplete, Harry!

  That which Voldemort does not value, he takes no trouble to

  comprehend. Of house-elves and children's tales, of love, loyalty

  and innocence, Voldemort knows and understands nothing.

  Nothing. That they all have a power beyond his own, a power

  beyond the reach of any magic, is a truth he has never grasped.

  *â€˜He took your blood believing it would strengthen him. He*

  *took into his body a tiny part of the enchantment your mother*

  *laid upon you when she died for you. His body keeps her sacrifice*

  *alive, and while that enchantment survives, so do you and so does*

  *Voldemort's one last hope for himself.'*
#+end_quote

And just a reminder that the the Master of Death is an empty title from a fairy tale and that the Hallows are merely objects created by the Perevell brothers, so uniting them has no effect.

#+begin_quote
  â€˜So it's true?' asked Harry. â€˜All of it? The Peverell brothers --'

  â€˜-- were the three brothers of the tale,' said Dumbledore, nodding. â€˜Oh yes, I think so. Whether they met Death on a lonely road ... *I think it more likely that the Peverell brothers were simply gifted, dangerous wizards who succeeded in creating those powerful objects.* The story of them being Death's own Hallows seems to me the sort of legend that might have sprung up around such creations.

Just to be clear Dumbledore had literally owned all the Hallows and had the opportunity to study them.
