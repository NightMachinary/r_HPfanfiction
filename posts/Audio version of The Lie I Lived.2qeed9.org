Does anyone have or know of a radio drama, audio book version of The Lie I Lived by Jbern? I've been trying to get my wife to read it for a long time and when we took a drive to my family for Christmas I read the first couple of chapters to her, and when I drove she read for me. But when I speak for so long I get headaches.

I tried downloading Inova TTS but I can't seem to figure it out. I use Aldiko but also downloaded Moon +, but still can't seem to figure out how to get the TTS to work.

Any help would be appreciated, and Merry Christmas everyone.


** That would be pretty fun to be in a radio drama version of TLIL. I'd be into it. Dibs on the part of the Sorting Hat.

*** It's a pity that Sam Kinison (after whom jbern modeled the Sorting Hat) died in 1992.

** I was in a thread the other day where a guy recommended a TTS program that he said worked very well. I'll see if I can find it for you but I'm not sure I'll be able to.

**** Yeah I was trying to find one by a different name that I'd heard really good things about, but I don't seem to have commented on the thread where I saw it. The only thing I could find that sounded maybe vaguely familiar was Soundgecko, but that seems to just be a chrome app, so idk.
