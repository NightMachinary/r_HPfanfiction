:END:
Hello fellow redditors.

I'm looking for a specific fanfiction series I've read.

The first book was set in Order of the Phoenix as far as I remember (could be wrong though), Harry was tired of dealing with Voldemort and so set out to move out to America. He specifically sought out emancipation , got it successfully, and emigrated out to America to attend a wizarding school there.

I remember that one of the main characters in the book was called Sophie, and that one of his friends was Drew, who was into American football.

If I do remember anything else, I'll be sure to update you guys.

I'd appreciate any information I could get.

UPDATE : I found the book -> The Brave New World by bellerophon30


** I hope you find it, I think it might be
