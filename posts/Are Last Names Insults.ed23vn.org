In the HP series, whenever two characters are in less then amicable relation to one another they use each other's last name as if it were an insult. What is up with that? Is it a British thing?


** Calling someone by their last name is not an insult, but from context authors will often have last names said in an insulting way. It's a pretty common thing, and just used to emphasize that two people aren't on a first name basis. I also see characters refer to each other by last names respectfully. As far as I can tell its not only a British thing because I was referred to by my last name a lot in school as well, and I live in the midwest US. I also went to private school though, so maybe that made a difference?

Also its a big thing within sports teams

** It is a thing in old british culture, perhaps carried over to parts of the U.S. One would refer to anyone whom they are not close friends with by their family name, rather than a given name. It comes from the British upper classes, so perhaps why it's seen a lot in those noble house type fanfics.

** It's a British thing, very common with acquaintances especially in private schools. But something you still come across often enough, especially if you've a few friends with the same first name. "Alright MacLeod" is more acceptable than "Hello Neil number four."

** With the correct tone of voice yeah it can be insulting. I think for Harry calling Malfoy anything but Malfoy would imply a sense of friendship or familiarity that is neither there or wanted.

I've always been known to my friends by my surname funnily enough. Maybe we aren't as good of friends as I think. ðŸ¤”

** No, they aren't. It is polite to refer to strangers by their surname whereas the forename is reserved for friends and family. Secondly, some names like Tom, Dick , Harry etc. are very common ( especially among muggleborns, Dark Lords and scarheads) and it will create a lot of confusion if one were to use the first names only. Though, the full name can be used when there are more than one person sharing the same surname.

*** It is considered polite to refer strangers in a formal setting by their last names, usually previewed by the title Ms., Mrs., Mr., or perhaps in the wizarding world, Lord or Lady. In this case, they (however antaganistic they are) are not strangers, are not in any formal situation, and do not refer to each other by any kind of title.

I suppose it is kind of difficult for me to understand as I have never had that kind of adversity in school.

** Something nobody has mentioned yet but I feel is important is that when people in the HP world call out last names they aren't just calling the name. Understatement is a very British thing. When they say something what they don't say matters just as much if not more and what they do say is often filtered more for people they don't like.

When Malfoy calls Ron a Weasley he isn't just saying the name. He's calling Ron everything associated with the Weasley name, he's implying poverty, blood-traitor etc. When Ron says Malfoy he means spoilt little bigoted cunt, Death Eater etc, all the negative things about that family. This works because it's a small world where they know of each other.

**** It's a reminder his family is dead. Harry is all alone. It doesn't apply to all situations but a surname isn't just your name it's the family name, attacking the name is an attack on the family. There are plenty of times people use surnames normally, I walked to school with three boys called William, we used surnames normally but if you're using it as an insult you're making a dig at their family in some way.

***** I think it's truly less than that - it's that they aren't close enough to be on a first name basis. At least for Harry - both the Weasleys and Malfoys are a bit more of an archetype that play into referencing them like that.

** It's a mix. You can usually infer from the tone, I'd say.

It can be used neutrally, such as addressing someone you really don't know in a more formal way. For instance we see that a lot with the professors in the series - I believe McGonagall uses it often. Between students, you can expect it like you said (when they dislike each other), or to emphasize that they don't really know each other.

The next one is in the series, they often refer to each other by last names when discussing someone not there. Eg, when strategizing for Quidditch, they talk about how Diggory plays - not Cedric, not Cedric Diggory.
