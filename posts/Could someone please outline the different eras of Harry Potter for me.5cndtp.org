I read something on tumblr the other day about the Lightning Era (it was a Percy and Oliver one shot) and I was hoping someone could detail the eras and when they took place. The only one I'm really familiar with is the Marauder Era, and I'm not even sure what the seven books fall into.


** 1) Founders Era (fics about the founders of Hogwarts).\\
2) Grindewald's Era (fics about young Dumbledore and Grindewald).\\
3) Voldemort's Era (fics about young Tom Riddle, also known as Riddle Era).\\
4) Marauders Era (fics about the Harry's parents generation at Hogwarts).\\
5) Pre-Hogwarts Era (fics about Harry's life at the Dursley's, before he got his Hogwarts letter).\\
6) Hogwarts Era (fics set during Harry's study at Hogwarts).\\
7) Post-Hogwarts Era (fics set after the war and about Harry and the gang).\\
8) Next generation (fics about everyone's kids that we see in the epilogue).

** I've never heard Lightning Era before, but that sounds like it could refer to the time of the books, named after Harry's scar. Other than that, there's Marauder Era of course, plus Next Gen (Harry & Co's kids), and Founder's Era (Hogwarts founders). If there's anymore named era's than that, I don't know them.

**** There's also the *Riddle Era*, which is when Tom Riddle went to school, and the *Transformation Era* when he travelled the world and transformed himself into Voldemort.

Another rarely seen one is the *Merlin Era*, which according to canon falls after the *Founders Era*, but most people tend to write it as before so that they can use Merlin as a mentor to the Founders.

I'll edit this and add more if I can think of any.

** "Trio Era" is the bit covered by the 7 books. Cursed Child (if you count that as canon) is part of the "Next Gen" era Then there is the "Fantastic Beasts" era based on the new films.
