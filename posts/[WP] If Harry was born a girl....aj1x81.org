Hi everyone! This has been done before, I'm sure. I often wonder what the books would have been like (particularly the Snape/Harry) relationship if Harry had been born a girl, with red hair like Lily's, and James' eyes.

​

WP: James and Lily Potter's child is a girl, who has grown up with her only remaining family - The Dursleys - after her parents were murdered by the most evil dark wizard of modern times. The Girl Who Lived looks almost exactly like her mother - but with her father's eyes.


** I always prefer Fem!Harry with black hair and green eyes to be honest and still with the Harry character.

*** I think the particularly interesting point on a Fem Harry plot would be how Snape treated her if she resembled Lily more than James. I can't help but feel it would have been a completely different paradigm.

** ​

I wrote this introduction (my first so please go easy!) and would love to hear what you think!

“The Potters, that's what I heard -“

“Yes, their daughter, Rose-“

Vernon Dursley shook his head. He wasn't even sure his niece's name was Rose. It could have been Robin, or Roberta -

------

Petunia Dursley pursed her lips as she stood examining her reflection in the hallway mirror. Her blonde curls were tied in a headscarf, her fluffy pink dressing gown wrapped up around her thin neck.

It was early on a Saturday morning, perhaps just past seven. Dudley would be sleeping for another hour or so, the popkin, and Vernon didn't usually rise on weekends until well after nine. Petunia liked to use her Saturday mornings to give the kitchen a good steam clean, have a hot cup of tea and have a nosey from the kitchen window to see if Mrs Next Door had left her washing out overnight again, before getting Dudley up and beginning the battle to get ready for the day.

Petunia shuffled over to the pristine chrome kettle, popped the button down with a satisfying ‘click', and returned to the hallway to collect the morning paper from the doormat. She hummed the theme tune to her favourite soap opera whilst she slid the chain from the front door.

She screamed. A high-pitched, short lived scream which she immediately stifled by clamping her bony hands over her mouth.

On the doorstep, where the milk should be, was a wicker basket which appeared to be full of blankets - amongst which was nestled a letter, and clutching the edge of the letter was a tiny, tiny hand.

Petunia stepped slightly to the right, her hands still tightly pressed to her face. She heard Vernon call from upstairs, ‘is everything alright, Pet?'

Petunia couldn't answer. She stared down at the bundle at her feet. Tentatively, slowly, removing her hands from her mouth, she stooped to gather the arrival into her arms. A little girl. Petunia knew immediately from the face. That face - Petunia was transported back twenty two years, to her parents folding her into her arms, with the new arrival of her baby sister.

“Petunia,” her mother had whispered, “This is your sister, Lily”. Petunia remembered the hospital smell, the feel of the woolen blankets, the soft warmth of the new arrival, her father's hand lovingly stroking her hair. She'd had no idea what the beloved bundle would turn out to be.

But - something had gone wrong. This baby's eyes weren't the deep, emerald green of her sister's. The hazel eyes peered up at her, the pouty mouth smiled a gummy smile, and one hand reached towards Petunia's face. Petunia's mind was blank as she automatically began to gently bounce the baby, whispering ‘shh', just as she did every day with Dudley. The instinct was completely automatic. The front door swang shut.

The baby's head was covered in downy, soft, auburn hair which already glowed with the warmth of the colour Petunia knew so well. The colour Petunia had longed for and envied for most of her life - the exact colour of her sister, Lily's, beautiful head. Petunia automatically stroked back the auburn curls and gasped - underneath the hair was a scarlet, lightning-shaped scar, blazed across the baby's forehead, like someone had taken a knife to a work of art.

Petunia's mind raced. Her eyes flicked to the letter she was holding. There was thin, slanting writing on it; she had seen that writing before, a long time ago...

However, she didn't need to read the letter. There was only one way by which this child could have wound up here.

“Petunia -“ Vernon was thudding down the stairs, his usually well-groomed hair sticking up at odd angles and his moustache askew. “What in the blazes-“

Vernon froze a few steps from the bottom of the stairwell. He balked as his small eyes flickered from Petunia's to the bundle in her arms.

There was a silence which seemed to last for an eternity. During this time, the bundle burbled quietly, stirring amongst her blankets. The shock seemed to fill the hall, and the world outside was silent.

Vernon descended the last few steps and looked down into the baby's face. Petunia watched him, his expression indecipherable.

“And what -“ he began, finally. “Are you - are we - supposed to do with this?” His voice was quiet, stern, unreadable.

“Vernon,” Petunia whispered, “She might not be - she might - be normal.”

Vernon said nothing. He reached out and took the letter from his wife's hand. He turned and seized a letter opener from the hallway table, swiftly running it through the letter, whipping out the thick, yellowed paper inside, and began to read with his back to her.

Petunia continued to bounce the baby quietly.

“Well,” Vernon said finally. “They're both dead. Your sister, her husband. Murdered, it says here.”

Petunia said nothing. It had been a long time since she and Vernon had had any conversation acknowledging the existence of PEtunia's sister, never mind her good-for-nothing husband.

“It says here,” Vernon cleared his throat “That we're - we're its only living relations left.” His eyes avoided his wife, and the package she held.

“This - this Al-Bus Dumbell- Dumbledore - is ‘respectfully imploring' us to - to take this - it - in. It says here” he continued, “the fellow who finished off your sister will want to come back for... this.”.

“Vernon,” Petunia said again, softly. “She might -“ Her voice trailed off.

Vernon Dursley eyed his wife beadily. His eyes finally flickered down to look at the child. It looked small, weak - nothing like the big, bouncing baby boy of theirs who slept soundly upstairs.

“We could take it to the orphanage. Deny any relation to it.” He murmured. “We don't have time for it - we've got Dudders - the nerve of some people - you can't just drop a /baby/ on someone's doorstep - no thought for our circumstances - no consideration...”

“What if - if she /is/ normal - not - not /freakish/ like them... We could... forget she was theirs”.

“It's red, like her” said Vernon, sceptically. He looked closer. “What are the chances of it being - not being - /weird/? When they were both - /that way/?”

A loud wail came from upstairs.

“I'm going to see to OUR son.” Vernon said pointedly/stiffly, slamming the letter down on the bureau, and turned his back once again on Petunia, making his way back up the stairway.

She stepped closer to it, and recognised in the distantly familiar writing, the post-script to the letter.

“Her name is Rose Potter.”

** My only advice: do not mindlessly follow canon plot rails.

A female Harry will have different personality, different experiences, different reactions from key characters, and most importantly, different decision making process.

Furthermore, there are already thousands of female Harry fics rehashing canon plot. We don't need more of that.

*** I had an idea for a female Harry with a lot of elements from other shows and media but it would just be a mess tbh

*** But that's the point - a different personality and experiences. But also, it's not necessarily going to be a huge deviation from the original character. Core characteristics, traits, and mindsets could easily be the same.

** The Carnivorous Muffin has an interesting perspective on that assuming that the creator themself would act to ensure that Harry Potter grows up the same way.
