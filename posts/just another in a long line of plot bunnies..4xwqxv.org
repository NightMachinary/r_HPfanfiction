A version of future/winner/Harry comes from another universe/timeline/whatever, to help this universe Harry win the war with his super skills

ok. we have seen this before a bunch of times.

Future/Winner Harry is an idiot and every one of his ideas to help are useless/ludicrous/just plain dumb.

this universe Harry just rolls his eyes and uses FutureHarry as judas goat/bait/cannon fodder

run with it if you want.


** Even though its overdone I always love the serious idea of this trope, but then when I continued reading about your idea for a twist, I couldn't help but smile. I think that could make a good comedy fic. Ill save this post and maybe will come back and write something with it sometime.
