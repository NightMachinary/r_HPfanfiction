** I enjoy the premise, and I enjoy the story as a whole, I just don't enjoy your take on Magic itself. It feels limited, Magic feels like something small in this fic, and I've seen that pitfall several times in several fics as well, you're not the only one doing it, it's just that the idea is almost wasted when you take someone as smart and as powerful as Dumbledore, and limit him and Harry to only three fields of magic in existence. Meanwhile, Dumbledore always seemed to be someone that studied extremely esoteric fields of magic.

The Battle between Harry and Dumbledore felt like a staged battle in my opinion, you don't really get the sense that Harry is trying hard, that he is attempting to put his full power and technique into every spell, yet he is against someone that keeps literally sweeping him off his feet, and getting the best of him. Instead, it feels like Dumbledore isn't that strong, Harry is just extremely limited in creativity and versatility.

  Yes, Dumbledore could easily conjure a dragon and have it kill Harry,
#+end_quote

That's the thing though, your creativity to Transfiguration feels limited as well. Instead of Dumbledore conjuring elements, creating an earth golem, Transfiguring the ground into a steel wall, you have him creating animals. It feels odd to have that be Transfigurations major use in a battle.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore could probably best Harry with one spell
#+end_quote

Not likely, but he can definitely best an over-zealous Harry running towards him, while Haphazardly throwing Transfigurations and spells, just sweep him off his feet with wind magic.

#+begin_quote
  For creativity and versatility I actually take offence to this comment. Harry used almost five spells in the entire books in fights -- Patronus Charm, Disarming Charm, Accio, Bombarda, and Stupefy -- Harry attacks, while underwhelming, were more varied that the books.
#+end_quote

Harry in the books isn't meant to take down Voldemort with actual magical skill, I'm assuming by raising Harry with Voldemort, you want the opposite. Harry won't beat Voldemort by conjuring animals from the ground around him, it's a limited Duelling style that doesn't account for Elemental Magic, Physical Magic (Telekinesis, Pyrokinesis, Etc...), Psychic Magic (changing a Transfigured Animal's Allegiance), and several other fields of magic that are hinted towards in the books.

I'd like to, for once, have the main character not have plot armor and luck to survive the entire time against a supposedly genius enemy.

******** You mean other than Telekinetically Flinging Debris, throwing various exotic elemental magics, using Ancient Spells from long-dead civilisations, mentally assaulting them while you duel them, summoning an Earth Golem, etc... etc...? Not much, I guess.

********* I would consider elemental magics to be curses/part of the dark arts. Earth golems would be a conjuration coupled with an animation. Mental assaults are possible, but I never said I wouldn't have Harry learn it. You are right about Telekinesis. Ancient Spells I would throw in with the Dark Arts and let's be honest, I doubt Dumbledore can teach Harry enough ancient spells to make a difference against Voldemort that he doesn't already know or can deal with easily.

********** 1. Elemental Magic is pretty much its own field of magic imo, I mean there is Conjuring Flame with Transfiguration, and Shooting it out of your wand with Charms, but true Elemental Magic would be Creating, Manipulating, Increasing, and Reducing, an element. The only time we've seen this is when Dumbledore threw out a flame rope and used flames to make a sort of shroud against the Inferni. I don't think it falls under the Dark Arts.

Agreed, but there are also likely spells that can do the same thing without the middle-man of Transfiguration.

Doubtful, The Patronus Charm could be an Ancient Piece of Light Magic, doesn't make it dark.

#+end_quote

That's the thing about Dumbledore, he has been at the game of studying Ancient Texts, Spells, and Runes for far longer than Voldemort. There's also the fact that Voldemort could have gone to several places that Dumbledore has already been, only to find nothing there, as Dumbledore stole the book/text/scroll, or demolished it after learning its contents, in fear that a wizard with malicious intent would come across it and use it for ill-will.

  In a different world where the power of the mightiest wizards reaches awe-inspiring levels the events on Halloween 1981 end differently. Dumbledore takes Harry to raise and teach as an apprentice, the dissolution of the Death Eaters is not so effortless, and a scheme thousands of years in development comes to fruition.
