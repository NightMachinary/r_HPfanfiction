I'm going to be honest, I have no clue what this fic would look like, but it seems like it be interesting if an incoming student was a ventriloquist.


** "Check this out. I learned ventriloquism over the summer."

"You do realize there's a first-year charm that can do that, right?"

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12901407/chapters/29473305][Ottery st Catchpole]] by Erisha_Mae. Her story gives me similar vibes... Tumblr Prompt from accio shitpost: "i wanna see a muggle who goes stealth among wizards purely by having a ridiculous aesthetic" A muggle moves to Ottery St Catchpole a few months after the Battle of Hogwarts, and there's a slight misunderstanding.
