So many cliche Lord!Harry fics have Harry acting just as bad or worse than the Bad!Dumbledore and pureblood bigots he opposes. Are there any stories where his friends reject him for it like normal people would do? For example, Harry kills Ron in an honor duel, and his "true love", Hermione, leaves him because she considers him a murderer. Or better yet, she leads a rebellion to overthrow the Ministry because they refuse to accept one law for the nobles and another law for the people. That would probably be better than 90%+ of regular Lord!Harry fics.


** But he's eleven! His voice is essential in Parliament.

Seriously, though, I don't think that trope and genre go together. Lord Potter-Black-McGringotts fics are all about Harry & Co fixing the world through the author's warped view of the legal process. It's wish fulfilment and those who write this way would never subvert their own favourite method of 'fixing' the HP universe by allowing their protagonist to fail.

linkffn(10595005) covers this part of your request (sort of):

It's really wish-fulfilment-y.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

** Yes, I totally support!

I would like to see one story where Harry basically continues the crap pureblood policies after getting rid of Voldemort, and Hermione rises up to overthrow him.

** It's always a weird part of those Lord Potter stories where the heroes battle an evil and corrupt system - a heriditary aristocracy - by using that very system. No one ever seems to think: "Aren't we hypocritical? Shouldn't we consider what would happen if Harry's heir turns out to be evil, or corrupt, or petty?" Everyone seems to forget how stupid the system is as soon as Harry can order people around.

** On the opposite side, does anyone care to recommend a few bigot Lord!Harry Fics where Harry and Co fix the world?

*** linkffn(Rise of the Wizards) is everything you've asked for. Exactly /how/ the world has been fixed depends on your perspective, though.
