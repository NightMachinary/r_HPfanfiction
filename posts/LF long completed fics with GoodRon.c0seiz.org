I am not really asking for the paragon of quality. Just something fun and engaging that is long enough to feed my beast for a while.

That makes me think that we should have a Feed The Beast list which is all about decent stuff you read when you've got nothing better to do.


** Not sure if the Weasley Girl series counts? It's Fem!Ron, and the first three fics (one short prelude, two novel-length) are completed and of decent length, but the final novel-length hasn't come out yet. I think it's good though... linkao3(6130632; 3721921; 3793561)

Anything by Solstise Muse is worth checking out. She writes a good Ron. My fave is Eternal Sunshine of the Scourgified Mind, which is about an alternate outcome to the final fight with Voldemort... Harry, Ron and Hermione defeated Voldemort, but mysteriously lost all their memories of anything magic. Ron doesn't actually show up in the fic until like the last scene in chapter four, but as the fic goes on he pretty much becomes the main character. linkffn(2594688)

Then there's To Know You Is To Love You, which is about Ron and Hermione going through some unorthodox couples' councelling before getting married... essentially they get to witness and experiences each other's lives. So it's basically the canon story told through the eyes of Ron and Hermione.\\

  February 29, 1980. Leap Day. At the Burrow, Bill, Charlie, Percy, Fred and George, and (sigh) Great Auntie Muriel are waiting for the newest Weasley brother to be born. But something unexpected is about to happen. One-shot, prelude to the "Weasley Girl" trilogy.

  AU: The first friend Harry Potter made on the Hogwarts express wasn't Ronald "Ron" Weasley; it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter of the Weasley clan. And all of a sudden, the future looked very different.Join the newly-formed "Potter's Gang" (consisting of Harry, Ronnie, Hermione and Neville) in their first year at Hogwarts as they get into all kinds of misadventures, and maybe have to face a certain Dark Lord before they're ready for it.First novel in the "Weasley Girl" trilogy. Fem!Ron, but not a romance, and not a canon rehash.

  AU, Sequel to "Weasley Girl." In an alternate universe where Ron Weasley was born a girl, and where Harry's first Hogwarts year turned out a little different as a result, the famous "Potter's Gang" are back for their second year at Hogwarts and hoping perhaps for a calmer year... ...but with a dramatic escape, a mysterious diary, a strange cat, a "loony" girl, a hidden monster and many past secrets coming to light, it looks like this year will be at least as eventful and dangerous as the previous one.Second novel in the "Weasley Girl" Trilogy. Fem!Ron, everyone else is their canon gender.

  Gen. Harry has reached a very bitter thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the pure-blood bigotry. Then he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear down the system and salt the earth.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships.
