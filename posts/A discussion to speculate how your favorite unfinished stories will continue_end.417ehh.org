So like the title says, I just wanted to discuss how some of my more favorite unfinished stories will continue from where they'be been paused.


** I'm interested in where linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by the Santi) is going. Until now its basically a rehash, except we only see it fleetingly from an outside perspective while exploring magic, the dark arts, and getting to know some OC/OC standins.

This is all great fun, my question is where the story will diverge, or if it ever will. I had a thought that Harry might not be a participant until the Battle of Hogwarts. After all Durmstrang lets out earlier than Hogwarts, Harry graduates comes home, fights the final battle, and its over, cue epilogue.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

*** I personally have not gotten around to reading the five chapters available in the DLP forums and so I'm basing my comments off of what is available on ffn.net.

I think that Harry will not end up going "dark" but that the divergence will occur when Harry turns out to be much harsher and "darker" when it comes to the actual final battle. He'll end up creating a divide on how exactly to bring down the Death Eaters and his brother will end up falling in the middle of it. By this time his brother has grown up and though he respects Dumbledore and his methods, he probably thinks for himself and he feels divided on how to fight this war.

My thoughts come from the idea that HP and the BWL is a story that focuses more on morality character interaction than "fighting the bad guys." The bad guys will be fought and defeated but the true meat of the story is how the characters change and adapt to the existence of to a twin who goes to Durmstrang.

** Reign of the Serpent linkffn(9783012) :

[[/spoiler][This story blew me out of the water when I read it during Thanksgiving. Sadly there hasn't been an update in almost three months but I have to say, the AU world building is phenomenally worked out and the characterization for each of the main characters is extremely well worked out. I cannot wait to read about the implications of change in Harry's mindset after overhearing Lily Potter's and Hermione's conversation. I assume that Harry will continue to act ignorant of what happened at that discussion and will use it to create a new goal that will form the bones of the ambition to overthrow Salazar.]]

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

** Most of my favorite WIPs are sadly abandoned. I still hope Perspicacity reverses his opinion on posting Misericorde and Lily, the Dagger and Rose sequel/conclusion, but I'm not holding my breath.

That said, HP and the Distaff Side and A Cadmean Victory are the two WIPs I'm keeping an eye on. linkffn(Harry Potter and the Distaff Side; A Cadmean Victory)

Distaff Side

[[/spoiler][There's so much left to do in this story that I can't really image where it will go in detail. The broad strokes are obviously that Harry, Luna, his dimensional twin, etc. will take on and kill Voldemort, and I'd imagine it will happen soon with how well their training with the Riddle clones have gone. Still, I'm very curious how it will happen and how the relationships will continue to unfold. I expect none of the "good guys" will die. I imagine Harry will go back to his original dimension...and hoping he takes his new friends with him. I also hope for a reconciliation of some sort between Harry, Black, and Lupin. Black as a poodle makes me snort in laughter every time.]]

Cadmean Victory

[[/spoiler][I love this story, huge H/F fan so that probably goes without saying. Author updates frequently, so frequently that I hope it'll be finished soon. I read the first 60 or so chapters (all he had done at the time) and loved it, but very very surprised with how ok Fleur is with Harry killing people; must be an obsessive kind of love, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but not nearly your normal kind of relationship. It will be interesting to see whether the relationship survives and what kind of conflict, if any, will stem from it. I personally think it's going to come to a head, and the two will end up physically/magically fighting, leading to a separation. I imagine they'd eventually reconcile, too, but...yeah. That said, there's about 30 new chapters to read, but I'd have to start over to get everything in mind. I'd burn through it in a few days and then be left wanting again that it's not complete, so I'm trying to hold off until the next major division or the story is completely told. (It's "three books in one" iirc.) So I'm not sure how much more has developed in the plot and relationship since I've last read.]]

** The Black Prince linkffn(11098283) :

[[/spoiler][I cannot wait to read how Margeary Tyrell was characterized in the story. If possible I would love to read about what Margeary thinks about Aeryn at this point in the story. She knows about Harry's "Black Prince" moniker which means she's familiar with his story. It'll be extremely interesting how she addresses her presence and existence as Harry's betrothed.]]

[[/spoiler][My guess is that for now we won't learn much about Aeryn since the author pourposefully had her left behind at Castlery Rock so her presence wouldn't impede or complicate the development of the Harry/Margeary romance.]]

[[/spoiler][I guess that within the next couple of chapters Harry will attempt to begin a prepping for a journey to Dragonstone to search for the Dragon Eggs.]]

  He remembers being Harry Potter. He dreams of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a beast borne of ice and death with eyes red as blood and an army of cold dead things. He is the second son of the king, a spare, but his fortunes change when secrets rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming, but magic is might.

*** I was wondering if this was a HP/GoT xover worth reading, but since it updated 100k words in the first 9 months, and hasn't been updated in over a year, I don't see the point in reading it now. This smells like abandoned.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.
