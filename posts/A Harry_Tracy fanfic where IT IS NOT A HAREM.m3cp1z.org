It's so annoying that most of what I find on the Internet is either Harem or way too short. If you know any Harry/Tracy fanfics over 100k (or with sequels) words pls rec.


** I don't think I've ever read a fanfic that was Harry/Tracey. Most of the time, if I see Harry paired with any Slytherin in a fanfic, it's with Daphne Greengrass

*** Why don't they get paired together? She's just as much a blank slate as Daphne.

Who is fanon Tracey anyway?

**** I agree, but fanon Tracey tends to be Daphne's best and/or only friend/sidekick. Which is why it's almost always Daphne who gets paired with Harry instead of Tracey. Can't have the mc dating the sidekick, now can we.

I have also seen Tracey portrayed as Daphne's bi-sexual lover just to give the mc easy access to a threesome/three way pairing.

** Though I'm a Haphne fan, I would like more Harry / Tracey fics.

I would also more fics involving a twist on Harry / Daphne / Tracey. For example, maybe Harry spurns Daphne and chooses Tracey. Or both of them get tired of his dithering and leave him. Or any other scenarios involving the 3 of them

** Most stories involving Harry/Tracey sadly are either harem fics or it's a Harry/Daphne/Tracey fic with Harry/Daphne as the main focus.

The only fic that I know of that comes somewhat close to your request is linkffn(4508835). It's only ~27k words, and while Daphne does later on join the pairing she isn't the main focus. (You could alternatively read the first chapter as a one-shot to maintain Harry/Tracey purity)
