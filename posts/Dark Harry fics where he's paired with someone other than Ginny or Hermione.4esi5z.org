** *A Cadmean Victory*, linkffn(11446957): dark Harry/Fleur, promising beginning, lousy ending, not one of my favorites, but meets your criteria

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

*** You're right. Promising start, but I got bored around chapter 70.

The cliches are easy enough to look past because it's written well, but the plot goes off the rails after a certain point, and skimming the rest didn't leave me satisfied with how it ended.

**** I read the whole fic and the thing that annoyed me the most was that the whole drama with Katie and Harry that resulted in them breaking up was so unbelievable and unrealistic. I get that it was dramatized somewhat but I feel like the author just made up some crap to pair Harry and Fleur together.

Harry/Fleur is a really popular pairing and it was sorta a shame to see the author miss out on a less popular and more interesting pairing.

**** I read the whole thing and I agree with what you are getting at. I have no idea when exactly the magic wore off but I think it was sometime after the Department of Mysteries. That is not to say that there weren't bad parts before nor to say that there weren't some fantastic parts after but it was around that point where the story went from fantastic potential to my accepting that it wouldn't live up to being the story I felt it could be

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp
