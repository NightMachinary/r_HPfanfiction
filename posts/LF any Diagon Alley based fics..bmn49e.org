Can anyone recommend a fic based in Diagon Alley. Perhaps Ron taking Hugo to buy his first wand or Harry taking James to get ice cream. Maybe Lily Evans and her parents first time exploring. Thanks.


** I love the post-war “Harry and co. get drunk at the Leaky Cauldron” two-shot that FloreatCastellum wrote recently. She has a lot of great, little details, like Neville slapping a galleon down in the middle of the table and drinks magically appear, and coming up with wizarding alcohol like pixie vodka and shots called Basilisk Eyes. linkao3(18564532)

Some of her story linkffn(The Colour of Everything) takes place in Diagon Alley, since Remus has a job at Flourish and Blotts.

I've also written an OC-centric, Diagon Alley-based fic about Ollivander's son. linkffn(The Wandsmiths)

EDIT: Hm, I'm not sure why the bot didn't grab the two-shot I mentioned in the beginning of my post. Here it is: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18564532/chapters/44004838]]

  For Remus Lupin, the Order of the Phoenix offers thrilling adventure and a sense of purpose, but the bitter war with You-Know-Who may cost him more than he can imagine... A canon compliant account of Remus Lupin's life, from Hogwarts onwards.

  (Formerly titled The Ollivanders) Todd Ollivander can't seem to shake his feelings for the new apprentice at his father's wand shop. It's not a good time to be distracted, as it's becoming abundantly clear that Ollivander's is a major target of Lord Voldemort's during the First Wizarding War. (I say which chapters are my best at the start of Chapter 1.)

** I really like [[https://aaran-st-vines.nsns.fanficauthors.net/Makers_of_Fine_Wands_since_382_BC/index/][https://aaran-st-vines.nsns.fanficauthors.net/Makers_of_Fine_Wands_since_382_BC/]] (I don't see the story on any major fanfic site). Although, it is a historic story, it still has a lot of the spirit of Diagon Alley.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/544680][If I Knew You Were Coming, I'd've Baked a Cake]] linkao3(544680) - Lavender, with Dudley's help, opens up an ice-cream shop in Diagon Alley after the war. (A strange premise, I know, but I promise it works.)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1260679/1/Realizations][Realizations]] linkffn(1260679) - Harry spends the summer after GoF living and working in Diagon Alley, unfinished but worth reading anyway imo.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/209084][Strength in Numbers]] linkao3(209084) - Marietta, Millicent, and Lavender open a bakery. Technically set in Knockturn Alley, but maybe that's close enough?

  It was funny to call it normal, but life can be funny sometimes: that was what Lavender had said, and Dudley, who knew he wasn't very clever, was bound to agree with her.

  Individually, Marietta Edgecombe, Millicent Bulstrode, and Lavender Brown bear the scars of their experiences during the war. Together, though, they just might find a recipe for healing. A story about food, forgiveness, and unexpected friendships.

  Harry returns to Privet Drive after 4th year and finds it...empty! What do you do when you can't go to your friends for help? Additional Story Notes FYI: a. AU Summer before Fifth Year Fic, b. Not particularly fast paced.
