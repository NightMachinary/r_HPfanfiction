Because no one has thought about investing in the Muggle world, and it turns out that the exchange rate is one reason that the purebloods aren't fond of Muggleborns.


** Somewhere there are some very happy drug addicts camping out in the alleyway where Gringotts throws out the muggle money

*** Yeah, apparently they would normally just incinerate the paper and melt down the coins. Harry actually gets them to pay him to take the money off of their hands.

***** Because they are ignorant of its value. The purebloods' taxes subsidize the exchange rate, but the goblins have no idea that it can actually be used for something. In the fanon of this story, there's a complete logical disconnect from the Muggle economy.

** It's linkffn(Irish Home by White Angel of Auralon). It's absolutely unbelievable that Goblins don't realize the value of +muggle money+ /anything/.

  Harry decided that he didn't want to suffer at the Dursleys again and thanks to a discovery he made, he uses another option he found out about. After all, who would want to have a horrible summer with them, if anywhere else would be much nicer? One Shot
