I have read a lot of fan fics lately i have been looking at cross over stories my current favorite is either Pack by mjimeyg or Harry potter and the Stargate by Sinyk. Just curious what is your favorite cross over story?


** I have quite a few I like,here are some of them. I am terrible at summaries these are better than they sound.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12498125/1/Umino-Iruka-and-the-Will-of-Fire]]

Naruto cross, Boruto era Umino sent to HP universe.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11634921/1/Itachi-Is-That-A-Baby]]

Naruto cross, Harry raised by the Akatsuki, crackfic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9261735/1/Madness-at-the-Gate]]

Stargate cross, ooc Harry as mad scientist, has purely HP prequel on author profile.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10918531/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Philosopher-s-Stone]]

Fate cross, Shinji discovers his ability with witchcraft before he can become a complete douche and is the MC. Lots of sequels on author profile.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12881601/1/Swords-and-Sorcery-No-Route-Back]]

Fate cross again, Shirou sent to HP universe by jeweled sword de-aged into an 11 year old, sequel on author profile.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11949378/1/The-Colours-of-the-World]]

FMA cross, Roy Mustang sent to HP universe by Truth to deal with Riddle having blocked Truth's access to him, also on Ao3 if you prefer that.

Bleach cross, Ichigo sent to guard Potter but hilarious take on this trope.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8400788/1/Inquisitor-Carrow-and-the-GodEmperorless-Heathens]]

Warhammer 40k cross, Harry is teleports to the future at the end of first year and returns as a 300 year old Inquisitor of the Imperium of man with a Space Marine physiology, hijinks ensue. Knowledge of Warhammer recommended but unnecessary to enjoy the fic. Lots of sequels on author profile.
