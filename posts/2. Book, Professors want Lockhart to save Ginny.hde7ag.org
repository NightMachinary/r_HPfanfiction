Harry and Ron couldn't believe what they heard. They wanted Lockhart to go save Ginny?! Are they crazy? That fraud is not even capable of dealing with pixies! "W-well, then I will g-go and prepare t-to save the lit-little miss W-Weasley!" The fraud said. Ron got angry, very angry. The life of his sister was on the edge and they wanted HIM to save her?! "WHAT?!" Everybody looked shocked as Ron ran to the professors and started to yell. "My little SISTER, an innocent student under your care is in danger, could possibly even DIE and YOU want to send t-this fraud, this good-for-nothing to save her JUST BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BE PETTY?!?! How incompetent are you?!" Everyone was shocked by Ron outburst. With big eyes, they took in Rons red and angry face. They couldn't even scold him for it. Since it was nothing but the truth what he said from his point of view. In his worry about his sister he, and Harry, as they saw him walking to them with a sour face didn't recognise that they were just joking. (The professors looked mortified by his speech. They didn't realise they really were going to risk a child's safety and life because they wanted to taunt Lockhard.)

Harry continued: "Slytherins monster is a Basilisk." Gasps were heard. Professor Sprout could just whisper: "How do you know?" "Hermione was the one who figured it out actually. She had a little piece of paper in her hand when she was found. It was a page of a book with the description of the Basilisk. It all made sense then. The students never saw the monster right in the eye. They only saw the reflection. The cat through the water on the ground, Collin through his camera, Justin through Sir Nicolas and since a ghost can't die a second time he got petrified too. Hermione and Clearwater through the mirror. The gaze of the monster was weakened, so we knew, it was never meant to just petrified them. It was meant to kill them." More gaps were heard. Someone even whimpered. Harry didn't let that disturb him. "We also know how to get to the chamber of Secrets. We asked Myrtle. We knew the chamber was opened once before and she was the one who died 50 years ago. We asked her what she knew and Myrtle told us that the last thing she remembered was a pair of yellow glowing eyes from the direction of the sinks. I found a little snake graved into one of them. The entrance of the chamber is in the girl's toilet on the first floor and you need a parselmouth to open it." Ron said the final piece: "You have two options: Stay or come with us. We are going to save my sister, no matter what you say. It is your decision if you are going to take your responsibilities seriously and help us save her or if you are going to sit at the side and wait for what is going to happen like Dumbledore."

They needn't be told twice. All four heads of houses straightened their back and grabbed their wands.

Edit: After I read a comment that commented on the reaction of the professors I thought about it and has to say it was kind of dump what I wrote in that part. They are sometimes rather neglecting but not in that way. I will let the original stay but in brackets and write something that fits in better.


** You do realize that they weren't actually sending Lockhart to do anything, right? They all knew he couldn't do a thing, they were just getting him out of their way so the actual competent faculty could work out what to do. Of course Harry and Ron don't understand this, they're kids and they're too worried about Ginny to focus on what's going on, but it's pretty clear. There are a lot of things you can criticize the teachers at Hogwarts for, but this is not one of them.

*** I think this is an accurate reaction that Ron would have. He does have problems with dealing with emotions and he was probably struggling with preemptive grief, if he wasn't worried about getting caught he would have acted this way, even if he didn't whole-heartedly believe what he was saying. Just like he was mean to Hermione and Harry because he liked her, not because he actually distrusted them. The author is also not criticizing the teachers, but creating their own plot, and there's nothing wrong with that. The series is meant to be expanded upon now, the point of this subreddit is to post your stories, they're often not bashing, but a new, creative idea.

**** Oh, definitely, Ron's reaction is a 100% in character. but the professors' reactions?

If this is not criticizing I don't know what is. If op was creating a plot for them I wouldn't have said anything, but what they were doing is twisting previous events to make them look bad. And that's bashing.

** Later 4 statues of four formerly formidable professors were removed from the chamber of secrets after they each accidentally looked a basilisk in the eye attempting to save a student.

** Loved it! I couldn't understand why they didn't tell them to the professors either! It was so annoying!

** A Different Professor linkffn(11950451)

Harry and Ron argue over who to go to for help. Ron goes to Lockhart and gets obliviated. Harry and the twins go get McGonagall and Snape.

  "Her skeleton will lie in the chamber forever." Ginny has been taken to the Chamber of Secrets and Harry may know where that is. How would things have turned out if he had gone to a Different Professor? Rated T for violence and gore
