I remember reading a pretty long fic a while ago, I think on FFN, where a ?Wiccan? OFC (whose a muggle) gets captured by the Death Eaters for some reason. Snape helps her, and they get into philosophical conversations. I remember at some point they were moving through dark tunnels (hiding from the Death Eaters?) and she had experience walking in the pitch black. Does anyone remember this, and could they link me to it? Thanks!
