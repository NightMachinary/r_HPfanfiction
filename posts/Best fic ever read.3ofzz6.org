I know what you are thinking. "Oh another one of /those/ threads" and while you are slightly correct, there is always a catch. What is the best piece of Fanfiction you have ever read, that is not widely known? What makes that particular Fic so good to you? Mine is Hail Odysseus. linkffn(10645463) The characters are amusing to me, but then again, OOC Harry always amuses me.


** That is not widely known? God, that's a hard one.

I'd have to say maybe [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8280375/1/Retroactive][Retroactive]]. This is NOT a HP fanfic - it's in the Avatar: The Last Airbender universe, which is not nearly as popular to write in as HP - but it still needs more love. It's stellarly written and cleverly crafted.

In the HP universe, though, I'd have to say [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7689884/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Stars-Above][Alexandra Quick and the Stars Above]], with only 234 favourites. It's incredible.

** All of the recommendations here are really great. For something a little less known, we have linkffn(By The Divining Light by enembee), one of the best pieces of fanfiction ever made, and part of a trilogy of books... in which the third book has never been uploaded. It's got a sequel, Conlaodh's Song, but there is no book 3 in sight.

It's a sad fate for any fanfiction, which brings me to linkffn(In Atlantean Caves by obstacle1). It's a great story which was no doubt in part inspired by enembee's works, although somewhat more focused on romance. It's still a totally unique work that is worth reading, even though it's abandoned.

Now let's go even further. linkffn(Ramblings by Shikaku Zetsumei). This is worth reading for the third chapter alone. It's a short, one chapter story that explores a very cool concept similar to linkffn(Dimension Hopping for Beginners by nonjon) but not as humorous.

** these threads always baffle me

but the life and times is probably it for me. it's supposedly very famous but for some reason no one has ever actually read it. unfinished and 600k might be why

seriously though the grammar and writing qualify of most everything mentioned on this sub all the time is just pants. the rare stories without necessary "rough around the edges" qualities should he treasured. life and times is one

This doesn't seem sensible. If you've actually spent time on this sub, you should have come out with the opposite conclusions.

***** This sub aims to curate, and /because/ grammar is objective, if you spend time here, you'll realize that most fics recommended here have pretty decent grammar for fanfiction.

*** I did read it (Mainly cause my favorite genre is Harry working with muggles/using muggle stuff ; but there's so few about that so I get desperate.)

It was really good. Really good. And while it is abandoned, and ends on a cliffhanger, it is long enough, with enough completed subplots, that I think it's worth reading despite that. Also I hated and still do, the prologue. Just skip it.
