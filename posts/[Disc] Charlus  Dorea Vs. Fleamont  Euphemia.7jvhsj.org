This comes up a lot as a sideline in a lot of other discussions and recommendations, but I don't think I've ever seen it discussed on its own. Do you prefer the canon or fanon grandparents? Why? How do you imagine these characters to be?

EDIT: I was really pleased when I woke up and saw all the discussion that has happened while I was asleep. Thanks everyone!

DOUBLE EDIT: I've decided to stick with Pottermore for my fic, and I have vague ideas about Charlus and Dorea fighting Grindelwald in the forties.

** Rowling clearly never intended Charlus and Dorea to be James' parents.

  James's parents were elderly, were getting on a little when he was born, which explains the only child, very pampered, had-him-late-in-life-so-he's-an-extra-treasure, as often happens, I think. They were old in wizarding terms, and they died.
#+end_quote

In 2006 Rowlings Charlus and Dorea appeared for the first time - on a drawing of Black Family Tree which also showed Dorea to be 57 at the time of her dead. That's definitely not "old in wizarding terms".

#+begin_quote
  It wasn't until recently that JKR came out with Euphemia and Fleamont, and there were many people that, using the facts that had been given previously, came to the conclusion that Dorea and Charlus were James' parents.
#+end_quote

Some people are just bad at research and reaching right conclusions - the scale of not knowing misinterpretation of canon in fanfics shows that very well.

  Your dad's place,' said Sirius. â€˜Your grandparents were really good about it; they sort of adopted me as a second son. Yeah, I camped out at your dad's in the school holidays, and when I was seventeen I got a place of my own. My Uncle Alphard had left me a decent bit of gold -- he's been wiped off here, too, that's probably why -- anyway, after that I looked after myself. I was always welcome at Mr and Mrs Potter's for Sunday lunch, though
#+end_quote

He mentions his relation to Alphard and his being blasted out from the tree but wouldn't mention that people still on it are aforementioned Harry's grandparents? Really? And Alphard got blasted out for leaving him gold while Dorea remained despite giving him home for the time outside of Hogwarts? I think not.

Note that there is no need to include any information later than reveal of Charlus and Dorea existence to show that theory to be false.

** I prefer Charlus and Dorea. Not only do the names not sound utterly ridiculous, but they already existed in canon prior to pottermore. It just seems silly to me to pass up an already existing pair of characters with an interesting connection to the Blacks that can be built on in favor of two new random characters that only exist on pottermore and aren't even any good. Essentially for me it's a matter of book canon trumping pottermore canon for the most part. Even though Charlus and Dorea's place on the Potter family tree was never confirmed in-book, I think the fact that the book even mentioned them ought to give them prominence over any pottermore additions. On the other hand, I wouldn't mind the Fleamont and Euphemia characters being used as great-grandparents or placed elsewhere on the family tree so long as Charlus and Dorea have the grandparent slot. Then there's the fact that I've read so many fics that use Charlus & Dorea prior to F & E being made up that they've already solidly filled that niche in my mind and there's no replacing them. EDIT: On closer review, Charlus and Dorea's names didn't come up directly in the book, but my arguments that they existed as characters long before pottermore still stands.

*** Charlus and Dorea being canon would have also directly implied "Manipulative Dumbledore" being canon. Because if they /were/ canon, then Harry would have close family in the blacks, close family that was firmly in line with the light, and close family that was perfectly suitable to take him in. Namely Andromeda Tonks.

That doesn't even take into consideration sacrificial protection connected to Lily's blood, the obscurity security provided by hiding him in the muggle world, and the fact that the Dursleys are much closer relatives.

Dumbledore doesn't necessarily need to be 'manipulative' to place Harry with the Dursleys when there are plenty of legitimate reasons for it. The only things we can really fault him for is not investigating the Dursley's suitability more thoroughly, not checking up on him, and leaving him literally on the doorstep.

Actually, yeah, you're right. If Dorea is his grandmother, Arthur Weasley would be his second cousin once removed, and Andromeda would be his second cousin.

That would still make a "He had no other family to take him in" pretty much completely not true though.

The blood protection is a valid argument if someone of Lily's blood was needed, if it was only /family/ that was needed it isn't. I don't know if that was specified in the books myself.

I think Dumbledore specifically said that the Dursleys were Harry's last living family a few times. If Dorea were his grandmother he'd have to know he was lying, hence the manipulative part. But, like I said, I don't think J.K. ever intended for that to be the case, which is why she might have invented an unrelated set of grandparents with an unknown relation to the blacks for Harry.

JKR always said that James' parents were already very old even by wizarding standards when he was born. That just doesn't fit with Charlus and Dorea so the only way you could ever have believed them to be James' parents would be if you were not aware of the full Potter backstory.

And in any case, having multiple branches of the Potter family is more interesting.

(Are the any stories where Harry is Dorea's grandson and realizes how related he is to the Weasley's?)

I also just like the Fleamont and Euphemia back story. And I'm honestly surprised that all the writers who have tired of the "same old tropes" haven't embraced a new alternative. There's ALOT of story to be told with F&E that hasn't been told yet.

Because I was raised in a society that frowned upon cousin marriages, as I would suspect Harry's upbringing (in the wider muggle world) would as well. (Especially because he doesn't have any family. He finds out the Weasleys are cousins, in any form, he is probably not jumping to marry any of them.)

** There are 2 main things that I see on the argument of CD vs FE

Appearances: None of the pairs ever comes up in the books. This means that you have to take as canon either a family tree with no history attached to it other that first and last names, or an actual proper backstory written by JKR. It confounds me that people will shun pottermore as "not canon" yet will happily take the first option as if it somehow held more relevance.

Timeline: We only really had a couple of pieces of info relating to James' parents before pottermore. One of them, related to us through word of god, told us that they were already old when they had james, even by wizard standarts. Reminder that it's not unusual to see a 100 year old + wizard alive and kicking it throughout the books. With this in mind, Charlus and Dorea do not fit, given Dorea is marked as having died at the age of 57.

THis is stuff that can be garnered after the pottermore text came about, and you can make the argument that in retrospect its easy to dismiss charlus and dorea, but it's just been ingrained in the fandom for too long for most people to do so. However, even before pottermore debunked it, it still didn't make any sense. Besides the previously mentioned timeline issue, there's the fact that making them harry's granparents would make sirius and james directly related, as would harry. A fact never once brought up by the books, and wasn't there plenty of opportunity to do so, considering the ammount of times Sirius brought up both his family and James? It seems like a no brainer to mention that were it true. But, the thing that always made me dislike that theory, si that it almost takes away from Sirius and James' friendship, and even more importantly, the relation he built with James' parents. They'd just be his great uncles, were the theory correct.

And, as someone mentioned earlier in this thread, something I never really gave much thought to, Dorea being "nice" enough to give a second home to Sirius could very well be enough to blast her off the family tree tapestry, which hadn't happened. Not the give home to sirius per se, but the fact that clearly sirius considered her and her husband to be different enough from the rest of his family to actually like their company.

I was genuinely worried the first time I heard JKR was gonna publish a pottermore text about Harry's family on pottermore, because I thought it would confirm this senseless theory and I'd have to either ignore a worldbuilding text, or just accept that it made no sense, but thankfully she didn't.

** I've never seen anything really interesting done with Charlus and Dorea as characters that couldn't have been done with Fleamont and Euphemia --- they are mostly plot devices, as far as I can tell, and not the right kind --- and they mess up the canon plotline because they mean Harry /did/ have some surviving wizard relatives (namely Andromeda and her husband). Using Charlus and Dorea is mostly just a cheap ploy to make Harry "Lord Black". Canonically they are the blankest of slates.

On the other hand, Fleamont and Euphemia have at least /some/ canon characterization to them, an established, kinda charming backstory, etc. They're nothing /special/, but I like them. The Potters as Diagon Alley types as opposed to pompous aristocrats is much more to my taste, thank you very much.

On the whole, with a couple of exceptions, there's little reason why who Harry's paternal grandparents were should be at all /relevant/ to the story. Name-dropping Charlus and Dorea in this day and age when it's entirely besides the point of the stor just comes across as pointless, petty raspberry-blowing at Pottermore writings in general.

(The exceptions are, again, if for some reason you /want/ to push for a Harry/Black family connection, though I don't think it's a good idea; or if you started a story or AU using Charlus and Dorea back in the day when people didn't know better, and want to stay consistent.)

*** Good points, but I do have one I would like to refute.

Charlus and Dorea existing in canon doesn't throw off the plot line of the Dursleys being Harry's only living relatives.

If you go back through both bloodlines (James and Lily's) eventually you'll find a living relative no matter what their names are or whether they're mentioned in the books.

The point of putting Harry with the Dursleys is that it was the same blood flowing through Harry as it was in Lily and therefore Petunia and Dudley because it was a direct blood relative and that's why the blood wards worked according to dumbledore. (even though I think the whole explanation of how Harry first survived the killing curse is terrible and I would have preferred it remain a complete unknown to which no one has the answer.)

** I don't think "Canon" makes a lick of sense honestly. Mostly because it doesn't add up with Grindelwald's war. Apparently there was a Potter in the wizengamote who advocated for wizarding aid to WWI, yet when there was a war that already involved wizards, where were the Potters?

I really love fanfictions where Harry's grandparents have a role in that conflict, because to me it just makes absolute perfect sense. James was part of the war, Harry was part of the war, Apparently Rowling decided that even "Henry Potter", Harry's great-grandfather, was at least involved with a war. What about the generation that was alive during what was probably on of the most significant conflicts in recent history? That whole generation should have been knee-deep in it yet there's no indication this even occurred to Rowling.

I'm either not aware of Rowlings views on this, or she simply didn't have them. If the latter is the case, then I feel justified in saying that her views are irrelevant. If she can't take the time to make her later additions about Harry's family history consistent with the story she's already written, then I don't see how it's anything but badly thought out fanfiction. Kind of like that other book...
