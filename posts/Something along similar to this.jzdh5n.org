If you've ever seen anything like it I'd appreciate a recommendation, please and thank you very much. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15652377/chapters/36355131]] Anyway, I was hoping for something very similar to the actual premise of the story: Rowena Ravenclaw reborn as Harry. Although, I'll take anything that features her as a main character ( or Helga) during Harry's time period. I especially liked Rowena's personality in the fic, but it seems rare she is used at all in stories so her personality isn't necessary for the story but it would be appreciated.


** Yes, your nickname is at least honest. Please, tell us, WHAT was so interesting in the story you liked.

*** Ah sorry, it was, like, 2 a.m. when I posted (and I already haven't been able to get much sleep lately) and noting the specifics slipped my mind.

**** It didn't sound that snarky in my mind. I meant really, that without giving any specifics it is hard to decide what exactly was that made you interested in that story.

***** Nah, it's still my fault for not being specific. I appreciate you pointing it out or other users wouldn't have understood my reuqest either.

** I'm just looking for ways to self promote my Fic and even I can't promote my Fic for this one.(nvm [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13752653/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Mirrored-Fates]])

*** Story isn't really super relevant to my request but that's my fault for the original post being super vague. As an apology for my blunder, I'll still be checking out your story as it progresses since you recommended it (and it sort of technically fit my vague ass request as it was before I had to edit it).

Also, thank you for the recommendation.
