As someone who's been involved in the fanfic community since the early 2000s, I don't actually recall this happening. So many of the early fics I remember stayed quite within the defined lines of JK's world, just being continuations, pre-narratives, OC additions or focusing on alternative characters.

It's an interesting subgenre to think about because in many ways it strays so far from the world JK creates, as well as having - I think - curious links to very particular fantasies and the 'exotic' - almost consciously non-Western or unfamiliar influence, considering how much the West in general is horrified by the very idea of arranged marriages in real-world societies.


** The first one appeared in response to a writing challenge. (Somone on the Granger Enchanted Survivors page posted a link to it in response to this question a couple of months ago) I'm not a fan of the marriage law trope so I didn't make an effort to remember it's name or the name of the challenge.

I'm not sure how long after the appearance of the first story the premise was popularized and became the familiar trope - I can see why it did though. By invoking this trope you can force to disparate characters together without requiring you write a plausible scenario to organically bring them together.

*** As a follow-up, I've often wondered about the demographics of marriage law writers and readers. I've always imagined the writers come from a very specific subset.

It's interesting to consider as an aside to how the fandom - and fanfiction specifically - community has transformed and evolved in terms of its demographics.

**** Agreed.

There have been no end to the surveys posted to the community regarding our make up (in the time I've been utilising Reddit anyway) it would be fascinating to collate a chronological sampling of those and see the community's evolution over time.

*** I'm a big Charlie/Hermione fan, and many, though not all, of their pairings come together with this marriage law trope. While I don't have any problem with it, one does have to question why on earth Charlie and Hermione would be paired together with it. From canon, I can't remember any instances where they actually held a conversation (though it can be assumed, in a way, when she visited the Burrow before/after the World Cup) and maybe perhaps at Bill and Fleur's wedding.

But the two of them being matched with a marriage law isn't very plausible at all, yet what context of the marriage is plausible in the first place?

**** And therein lies my problem with the entire "marriage law" trope. I have said it many times before - it just doesn't hold water.

After a bitter and divisive war to remove a dictator from power before he could impose any more draconian laws regarding bloodlines, magical purity and by extension, reproductive rights, on the populace the newly restored Ministry enacts a draconian law designed to increase the magical (bloodlines and purity - given the law is applied to unite magical with magical) population by removing the populaces' reproductive rights.

Seems unlikely right?

Then there is the whole age issue involved - it is usually enacted (within the story) to include Wizards from the age of majority (17) to say 50 (or other arbitrary upper limit) in order to capture in its sluice the familiar canon characters. However, given the life span of wizards it seems much more likely that even if such a law were considered it would be applied to the OLDEST witches and wizards of breeding years still unmarried/childless rather than the YOUNGEST who still have their entire child rearing years ahead.

Moreover historically nations who have tried similar policies (yes, looking at you Nazi Germany) realised that creating monogamous unions actually stymied maximum possible population growth and that dissolving marriages and encouraging men to impregnate multiple women of child-bearing age was a better bet.

Yeah so... tl:dr Marriage Law Fic, Judy no like Bad Medicine.

**** Voldemort attacked Weasleys at the Wedding, most of them with the exception of Bill, Charlie, and Ginny were killed. They fled to France, regrouped, and fought a vicious guerilla war against the Death Eaters. When they finally prevailed, Charlie and Hermione already fell in love with each other....

** Oh hey I found it! The first ever marriage fic was:

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/223901/ChelleyBean?a=b]]

And it was written as part of the challenge to the WIKTT Yahoo group challenge put forth by Chelley_Bean herself (his self?)

*** I've always assume that marriage fic, like soul bond fic, come from some other Romance source and the concept was just appropriated. Wait, are soul bonds native to HP fanon, too?

**** That I don't know I'm sorry. I only knew the details of the first marriage law trope stuff as I had bookmarked a conversation elsewhere about it as I was interested in dissecting why some plot devices become popularized and enshrined as tropes and others don't.

I imagine similar devices to the marriage law and soul bonds exist in a great many fan fic communities as the utility of them and the ideas they are used to explore would be very broad.

**** Jeconais's most famous fic are the one with Harry/Ginny, without any mariage contract and Harry/Gabrielle, again, without any mariage contract. You my dear sir, just lied. He may wrote one or two mariage contract fics, but they weren't very popular and probably not the first one.
