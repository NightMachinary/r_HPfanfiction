By Malfoy's, I mean any number between one and three. /Choose your character(s)/!


** He didn't expect to see Draco Malfoy there, clutching a bouquet of flowers and sobbing.

"I'm sorry, Dobby," he said between sobs. "I'm sorry, I didn't know. I found my fa--Lucius's notes. You, Dobby, were my real father."

Bill quietly went back into his house, locked the door, and pretended he'd never heard that.

** No, they're still thieves.

House elves don't actually die, you see; you can grow them back from their head. That's why the Blacks mounted them on the walls, in case they needed a larger serving crew for a ball or similar engagement. The Malfoys are visiting Shell Cottage in an attempt to reclaim their lost servant.
