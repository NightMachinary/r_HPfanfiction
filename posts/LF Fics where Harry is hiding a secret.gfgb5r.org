Idk how to describe it but. Like. In time travel stories Harrys trying to hide the fact that hes from the future, and same with dimension travel fics. And in WBWL fics where he's the BWL he's usually trying to hide his identity. Basically like in linkffn(Saving Connor) where he's trying to hide his abilities and his feats. Or even like in abusive!Dursley stories where he's trying to hide the abuse. Or stories where he purposely preforms low in class to hide his true abilities.

So if you have any recommendations that have the same sense then much appreciated.

Don't mind about pairings but I prefer mentor!snape


** I think I get what you mean, hope it's stories like these that you want.

Make a wish - linkffn(2318355) - Harry goes on a world trip while trying to keep his identity hidden creates a new one.

Novocaine - linkffn(13022013) - Harry gains a lot of power at the end of the war and wants to push for a lot a change but not with him in the spotlight.

Quoth the Raven, Nevermore - linkffn(6652537) - For a good portion of the fic Harry has to keep his identity a secret as well as his skill.

Amicus Protectio Fortis - linkffn(11547735) - Harry leads a far more impressive DA that tries to keep themselves hidden from the other factions.

** I really like ‘Again and Again' by Athey but I think it's because I've just finished re-reading it and it's on my mind. It's Tomarry and a redo fic more than time travel, but he makes a lot of excuses for him knowing the stuff he does, and I think time travel is one. He downplays his power a l o t really confuses Dumbles in and keeps quite a few secrets.
