**** Well, the concept is basically that. But it is also a dimension-travel story: Druggie Harry is from another dimension where everything has gone wrong. So wrong that he must take potions to dull the pain and thus never feel or sleep. But still, he wants to make things right in the other dimension. Basically, you're following the POV of the "Harry" of the new dimension, who is a girl. It's around 4th year, if I remember correctly. But the main point of intrigue of the fic is Druggie Harry, to be honest. And it's really good, imo.

EDIT: I'm reading myself and yeah, I know I'm a bit crappy at describing fics... But anyway I found the concept intriguing and it was well-written enough to be enjoyable so don't hesitate to give it a go!

  How different would Harry Potter's first year of school have been if the Dursleys had successfully suppressed Harry's natural curiosity? This NARRATIVE shows what could have been.
