There are lots of fics where Harry stops being friend with Ron and Hermione only to get himself new friends who support him just as much, in addition to never disagreeing with him. I think that really diminishes the kind of friendship the trio had, where they would pretty much face certain death for each other, knowing that their chance of success are small.

Like, those kind friendships are not normal, most friends wouldn't fight terrorists and monsters just to help you.

This prompt is basically about how normal friends would react to the situations the Trio often find themselves in.

*** The book 4 thing was honestly pretty bad. It took about 12 hours for it to be clear that Harry was getting more grief than glory, Harry was emphatic he didn't do it, and Ron should've known Harry wouldn't do it. It was a dangerous, scary time and Harry really did need all the support he could get and Ron abandoned him.

Ron's treatment of Hermione in general (constantly belittling her for trying to do well in school) is not good friend, and his treatment of her wrt the firebolt and scabbers in book 3 were pretty shitty, especially when you consider there were signs he had noticed she was running herself ragged with her schedule already. (She was unambiguously correct about the firebolt, and who tf thinks cat owners have any control over their cats?)

I think people do exaggerate these things to bash Ron but when the pendulum swings the other way it seems like people just gloss over some seriously shitty behavior on Ron's part.

Cho's face stood out particularly clearly in the blurred crowd, her face glowing with admiration.... Harry grinned into his pillow, exceptionally glad that Ron couldn't see what he could.*

#+end_quote

Not really. Your snippets are missing context - for example, the very first one is right after the tournament is announced. There's immediately discussion about how every student seems interested in it - George and Fred immediately pronounce that they're joining, there's a whole bunch of people gazing raptly/picturing themselves as champions... and fairly explicitly, that /doesn't/ include Harry, who's watching everyone else. There's Ron dreaming about it as well. The excerpt you used is Harry drifting off to sleep - which I wouldn't consider proof of him wanting to join the tournament compared to the whole section earlier where that's pretty clearly absent (in contrast to everyone else).

(Side note, there's a fun exchange I noticed while paging through the book here. A few predictions they make up for Trelawney are a nice little prediction it seems - Harry predicting burns and getting backstabbed by a friend, for example, and Ron predicting that he'd drowned).

There's another similar daydream that happens after he's prompted by George when the Goblet is revealed, but again - to me, it being prompted by someone else + just being an idle daydream doesn't mean that he is actually interested in it. Eg, everyone's daydreamed about being in some sort of dangerous situation and coming out a hero. Does that mean that we actually want to be in danger? No.

#+begin_quote
  when hearing about the danger, he even thinks that he doesn't care about deaths that happened hundreds of years ago.
#+end_quote

Right, because he's got no interest in joining and he's excited by all the pageantry. The most telling bit is his reaction right after it happens - yes, he didn't put his name in. But if he'd /actually/ wanted to enter the Tournament like you claim, he should be /ecstatic/.

It's also explicitly addressed after he's selected.

#+begin_quote
  Was anyone except Ron and Hermione going to believe him, or would they all think he'd put himself in for the tournament? Yet how could anyone think that, when he was facing competitors who'd had three years' more magical education - when he was now facing tasks that */not only sounded very dangerous, but which were to be performed in front of hundreds of people? Yes, he'd thought about it... he'd fantasized about it... but it had been a joke, really, an idle sort of dream... he'd never really, *seriously/ considered entering...
#+end_quote

Does it make sense for Ron to be jealous? Sure. But does it mean that he should be /justified/ in not believing his best friend? We can see how much it hurts Harry when he isn't believed by Ron - and after 3 years of friendship, it should have been obvious to Ron that Harry wouldn't do that. (Eg - if he'd wanted more celebrity, what better thing to brag about than re-opening the Chamber of Secrets and slaying a basilisk?).

In the end, it's something that sticks with the reader - similar to how Ron is the likeliest to be casually offensive/mean of the three (eg - book 1 comments on Hermione that make her run off and cry). Does it make him a bad or terrible friend? No. But it does stand out, particularly when one of his often stated strengths is loyalty.

****** Well, Ron is a 14 year old boy, who isn't privy to all of Harry's feelings, and isn't able to judge someone's feelings. He simply lacks the life experience and maturity to do that. So, he sees everyone talking about joining, and even if Harry never said outright "I'd like to join!", he also never said "I disagree, Ron, I wouldn't want to join."

It's therefore extremely reasonable to assume Harry wanted to enter.

Anyway, the reason I think it is an example of Ron's loyalty, is that he attempts to squash down his anger, and congratulates Harry at first. He's clearly hurt Harry didn't include him, but he's prepared to try let it go. It's only when Harry apparently lies to him that Ron gets mad. There are certainly lots of logical reasons why Ron should have believed him, but he's a teenager, whose nature is more passionate than logical. People think it's jealousy, but it wasn't. Ron is typically very supportive of special things Harry gets - Quidditch team, Nimbus, Cloak, Firebolt, Snape's potion book, the Map, etc etc.

******* Ron is by no means a terrible person, and we can understand and see why he reacts that way. But it's still his choice to let his jealousy (and anger) overtake him instead of believing his friend. That's particularly true after the first day or two of their little spat.

Strictly speaking it's obviously ridiculous to define him by one moment like that - a short period of time during 4th year as a young man. But I think there's a reason that such moments stick out.

In terms of the squashing anger, I think you're misreading his words. They're not congratulatory, they read far more sarcastic and angry to me. It's particularly clear since he didn't stick down for the party - so he's been hearing a bunch of people having a good time, stewing on his own while it's going on, and finally sees Harry come up with the Gryffindor cape put on...

Yes, I can understand why he's angry. But IMO the things they went through (and how Harry never pushed his fame) should have taken precedence, and Ron seems clearly jealous to me - jealous, and angry that Harry hadn't included him. But that last part only makes sense if he's already disbelieving Harry...

The firebolt, at least her heart was in the right place, but I dislike that because she doesn't explain it to Harry and Ron. Seriously, it would have had no conflict if she right out and said "I think Sirius Black sent it Harry, Ron. Let's take the broom to the teachers to check over so you don't die."

1) Harry had given Ron no reason to mistrust him here

2) HARRY WAS THE CHAMPION OF A FOURTH SCHOOL WHICH SHOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE

3) Harry was limited to Hermione as his only friend for weeks while a huge fraction of the school had turned on him

Actually listening to Harry and TRYING to trust him at the beginning, noticing that Harry apparently did something he couldn't possibly have done, talking to Hermione about Harry's feelings on the subject, or noticing that Harry desperately needed his best friend are all easy ways Ron could've not made this fairly huge bad-friend move.

** I feel like this kind of friendship is forged through danger only- sure, Ron and Hermione are great people, but surviving life-or-death situations also ties them closer and closer together, starting with the troll. And, the older they grow, the more war-like their camaraderie becomes. So, while "normal" friends would probably not fight monsters along your side, those who have been your brothers and sisters in arms very well might (pls forgive the awkwardness of the sentence; not my first language).

I think the au would have to start pretty early on in Harry's life for the trio to include different people, and it's absolutely annoying when he gets resorted and it doesn't ruin every aspect of his social life.
