Could have had it after they kill his Dog (Sirius) but If say Draco Malfoy killed his Owl, and Harry ends up decimating the entire Death Eater organisation, killing every single one of them, just to get at Draco Malfoy, it'd fit better.


** It wasn't the people they killed that got Harry.

He'd lost if care for most people years ago, beaten out of him by a harsh life and ping pong public opinions.

But his Owl. His first present. His one friend who suffered alongside him for six years. That was a different matter.

Dumbledore left him a mission, but when the Death Eaters appeared at the Wedding Harry didn't run. Hermione and Ron did, but Harry waited for them. As soon as they appeared they died.

So often Wizards wrote off muggles. Funny then what happens when you combine muggle chemistry with transfiguration. Harry watched as they choked to death on chlorine gas. It filled their lung with fluid and they died like the animals they were.

The wedding party was stunned. Harry didn't want to hear their platitudes or admonishment. He apperated away.

XxX

It took a while before he associated saying Voldemorts name with Death Eaters appearing. Once he did it was almost too easy. He must have kiled half the oganization in ambushes at that point. Watching the Lestrange brothers burn after apperating into a field of transfigured naplam was a sweet treat, but he still didn't know who killed Hedwig.

When you got down to it, Tommy boy was to blame. Sure Harry needed to track down the Horocruxes at some point, but it took Tommy a decade and a half last time he lost his body. What if he lost it again?

Thus Harry was on his way to Hogwarts. He entered through the front gate. He was of a students age and technically on the rolls. A pair of faternal twins had tried to stop him. They stopped when their robes turned to white phosphorus with a wave of his wand and they were consumed in the flames.

Snape was the next to confront him. He had started to blather on about messing everything up and ruining the plan. He might have said more, but the air around his face turned to nerve gas, something Harry had looked up in his down time, and Severus Snape died a twitching mess.

The rest of the staff as astounded and Professor McGonagall had a sad look on her face, as if his use of transfiguration to kill in increasingly effective ways was a failure on her part. But transfiguration was hard to shield against, and few if any wizards and witches saw it coming.

The Slytherin dorms didn't see the sleeping gas he pumped in. Nor did the junior death munchers ever see the live gernades he switched with their tongues before their heads blew off. Draco Malfoy's headless body went great with a pike on the approach to Hogwarts

It only took three hours for Voldemort to rally his forces to confront Harry at Hogwarts, but three hours with idle hands is plenty to set traps.

The first way ran across the field and were introduced to bouncing betties, claymores, punji pits, and numerous other traps. By the time Voldemort cleared the traps out with his own magic his forces where cut down by a quarter.

He lost another quarter to mandrakes, stone golems and the various defenses of the other professors.

By the time he reached the caslte courtyard he was furious, but Harry was waiting for him. They clashed in grand fashion. Voldemort through increasing strange and esoteric spells at Harry.

Harry responded with transfigured fire and explosives. Voldemort did not fall to them easily. He may distain muggles, but he had grown up hearing stories of the horrors of the trenches and had seen the cruelty of bombing raids and come home to the stories of Dresden burning.

In the end it was not Harry who killed Voldemort, but Neville who had snuck around behind him while he was occupied by Harry and run the Sword of Gryffindor through his spine into his heart.

The battle was over and Harry passed out. In the aftermath he woke to find his friends around his bed, with Neville, burned and suffering from wading through Harry's failed attacks to strike Voldemort beside. him.

Over the next week, Harry recovered and Ron and Hermione shared their expirences. They'd found one of the Horocruxes, the locket of Slytherin and managed to steal it from Umbridge in her sleep. They knew where a second was, in the vault of Lestrange, after having captured and interrogated Bellatrix. Ron showed off his fake arm when telling the story of how he lost it in that process. The rest were unknown for now.

"How many escaped?" Harry asked once they finished telling.

"Don't know mate."

"There was so much chaos after Voldemort died, and there had been many not at the battle. Plus who do you count as a death eater when it is the only option for continued service?"

Harry agreed publicly to placate the, but by that evening he had disappeared. Death Eaters still walked the earth. Hedwig still required justice.

******* What do you think? If you don't mind sharing.

My editor is part of a wedding party. But the updated chapter 1-31 should be posted shortly after the first of the year with 32.

If there is anything that really stuck out as jarring or odd I'd like to try to fix it before then. If there is something I am doing well I'd like to keep doing it going forward.
