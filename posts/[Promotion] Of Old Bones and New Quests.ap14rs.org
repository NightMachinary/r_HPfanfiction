** This sounds so super cool and interesting, yes I will read it! :) I love post/pre/outside-Hogwarts-in-general stories! :) About adults and other people and stories than the main books.

*** Thank you sooo much!! I've got about 17 chapters up, so you have plenty to read! There are a couple grammar issues here and there which I'm aware of but I think you should enjoy this story. More chapters to follow soon!!

I also have another story which is a collection of one-shots of Harry and Co. in their twilight years!

** This story is very good! As an older man myself, I'm glad to see older versions of these characters and not only do I identify with some of the struggles but the plot is really intriguing. Takes a lot of unexpected turns!

*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13110269/1/][*/Harry and Hermione: Of Old Bones and New Quests/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/9249421/MetalVenomLudens][/MetalVenomLudens/]]

#+begin_quote
  This tale intends to chronicle Harry and Hermione's adventures and lives well into their old age after World War 3. It starts off sweet but quickly heads into the thriller territory, and some parts of it are truly intense, going to never before seen places in Wizarding World with a Civil War brewing up, and a mysterious Auror with an agenda of his own. Romantic Thriller. Harmione.
