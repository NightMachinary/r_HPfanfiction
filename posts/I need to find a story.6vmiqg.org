I have been looking for a fanfic where harry is raised by his parents, Sirius, and remus. He also becomes an animagus to help remix on the full moon. It's a panther form.


** A) Do you mean a specific story that has this, because if so we need a lot more info. Or do you just mean any story that has this?

2) I know this is just autocorrect hitting you, but I laughed *so hard*, you have no idea.

#+begin_quote
  He also becomes an animagus to *help remix* on the full moon

*** A)It's a specific story, I remember it from a while ago and I just want to reread it.

2) Lol, I hate autocorrect when I type character names and it changes it before I see it.

*** Everyone knows that Panthers have sick beats and phat rhythms and other hip things that show that I'm in my 30's.
