:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Sirius falls into the veil and Harry follows right after him. They both end up at The Department Of Mysteries but in another dimension. In this one Dumbledore is the bad guy and has a group called the "burners" and Tom is the headmaster. I also think that its Remus that finds them in The Department Of Mysteries.

Please help me find this fic I've been wanting to reread it for a while.


** It /almost/ sounds like A Black Comedy, but some of the details aren't matching up.

**** Harry doesn't follow right away, there's a multi-year gap. They don't meet Remus in the Ministry (although they do stay at his place). And Dumbledore is a good guy.

***** Nope. We are definitely reading different fanfics. If you're talking about the one someone else suggested it was. It was not the one I was thinking of. I'm also pretty sure the fanfic is in ao3.

  AU. Picks up near the end of OotP. Harry saw Sirius fall into the veil after being stunned by Bellatrix Lestrange. What would happen if he ran in after him? No Pairings yet.
