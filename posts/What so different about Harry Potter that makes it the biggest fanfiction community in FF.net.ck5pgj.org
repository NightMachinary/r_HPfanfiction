I just noticed that Harry Potter has twice more stories in ff.net than the following fandom (Naruto), which is weird because the series ended such a long time ago. Somehow, it's maintained its relevancy and still leads in first place by a mile.

You'd think that by now, something like the MCU would go way up the charts considering how massive it has become. The comic books also provide so much source materials to go off of, making it ripe for reimaginings and what-if scenarios, but it's not even anywhere near the very top.

What makes Harry Potter such a good story to write fanfics about?


** It's a combination of a few factors, imo:

A great setting - a wonderful hidden world in the modern day - which has a solid enough base while still being vague enough to expand and build on as you like.

The timing: It came out at the start of when the whole fanfiction thing really kicked off. Most fanfiction writers are of the generation that grew up with this story, and it simultaneously has a very large audience for the same reason. Supply and demand.

A diverse cast. There are a lot of fleshed out characters, a lot of basically blank slates, and some in between. Many of the characters are relatable to a lot of people (or have that 'bad boy' vibe that makes them irresistible to teenage girls).

Harry is a very flexible protagonist - Theres a lot you can do with him because he is pretty much a blank slate at the start of the story.

So many possible canon divergences. 'What if Harry grew up with/knowing x', 'What if Harry was sorted in a different house', 'What if Harry met x', etc, etc.

Crossover potential. Not only is it set in basically the real world, where a lot of stories are set, it also has stuff like the veil of death etc.

**** Being in the right time in the right place doesn't explain why is the community still so huge and still growing after all these years. I think the allure of HP comparing to other fantasy worlds (even when a way more mature ones and with very substantial fanbase like StarTrek or Lord of the Rings) is that it happens in (more or less) our current time in our (more or less) current world. Yes, there are problems that HP was before Internet, mobile phones etc., but with some improvements a fanfiction story from HP univese can be relevant for our current world and people can relate to it. Game of Thrones is fun and everything, but it is slightly more challenging to relate to the world once upon a time somewhere in the other world than to the world with microwaves, trains and (at least) telephones.

  Crossover potential.

It's also that it's magic system has a nice range. It /can/ do so many things if the character just knows how too. So basic sixth year Harry in Westeros has the potential to be quite impactful even with just canon Harry, but if you want to make him completely over powered that's also easy. Imagine a really angry Dumbledore in Westeros- he'd likely be able to blow up castles and burn cities better than any dragon.

When you compare that to something like Naruto it doesn't crossover quite as easily. Even shitty ninjas from Naruto could absolutely /slaughter/ armies in Westeros with just their hands and some sharp objects. That's not even going into the destabilization that would come from every enemy leader just being brutally assassinated again and again.

** It's not so much that Harry Potter is somehow more fanficable than other fandoms - though maybe it is, a little bit - but mostly it's that the canon is truly, ridiculously popular. There is a whole generation of people where almost every member read these books. Even the ones who don't really read books for fun. I don't think you realize how unprecedented that was. And if someone hasn't read the books, chances are they at least saw the movies.

Sure, Naruto is popular, but only among people who watch anime. It doesn't have anything near the widespread appeal that Harry Potter does.

It's also a matter of timing. When the books were coming out, the internet was becoming more widely available and fanfiction more popular as a concept. And the books came out slowly over a number of years, giving people plenty of time to imagine their own stories before the next book came out and stirred up the excitement all over again. And then the movies came out and kept the fandom relevant.

Nowadays it's mostly a matter of momentum. There is a crapton of HP fanfic already out there, of all shapes and sizes and levels of quality, and people read it and decide they want to play, too.

** Something that people haven't mentioned is Rowling's views on fanfiction.

As fanfiction was getting big people were worried about the legality and ownership of fanfiction. Some authors asked FF.net to remove fanfictions based on their stories, but JK said she is flattered by fanfictions based on HP, and as long as it remains non-commercial(/cough/ cursed child /cough/) she supports people writing their own stories.

So it was a fandom where you weren't worried about getting taken down or anything.

** The series ended a long time ago, but FF.N's archive includes many fics from when it was half-written up through the immediate aftermath of the ending. It was perfect timing for that site and HP: they got started together, and later writers wanted to go where most of the writing already was.

Also, HP was a cultural phenomenon and is a cultural touchstone in the way the other fandoms mentioned here are not. Everyone has heard of Harry Potter, regardless of age/nationality/etc. Everyone has not heard of Naruto.

** I think part of it stemmed from it was one of the first series that The author really encouraged fan fiction. I'm sure many people who are in their mid to late 30s and up remember the eras of take down notices and people being sued by Anne Rice. It was a very real thing and really caused a lot of issues if you wrote fan fiction.

J K Rowling just embraced it as a concept and idea and likes that people get that much enjoyment out of it. It's really spawned a whole generation of fanfic writers because you didn't have to worry about take down notices etc.

There are still some who fight fan fiction, not as heavily as Anne Rice did but still far more than most do now.

** I think its cause there are just so many ways we can twist, turn and change the story. We can make it so it only has small changes, or make it so different it would only have small similarities to Harry Potter.

** I only read fiction and don't write but the appeal for me lies for one with the setting and two with the characters. The potterverse is set up in a modern world that feels like ours and that makes it relatable. Yet with MCU for example we know for sure that it could never be our universe (because otherwise we would have seen iron man on tv). The potterverse is so well crafted that it makes you feel like it could actually exist right under our noses which makes it even more exciting. The characters on the other hand are well enough flashed out that they are very likable yet we „only“ have the 7 books content wise. With other fandoms (especially mcu) we have so much more source material. I can't even keep up with what the authors dish out - why read FanFiction about it at this point?

** Harry Potter has a very, very solid world built for it, but the story told in that world has an extremely frustrating foundation. It started as a children's story, and those early books had a lot of classic tropes of Children's stories: useless and absent adults, genius kids, simple social dynamics, very focused on one character, etc. And as it transitioned into being a more teen and adult focused series that shed those tropes, the frustrations older consumers feel from remembering that all these new events happened because of events built off of that childish foundation lead to a lot of fanfiction ideas. Just shake off one aspect of the children's story origin and suddenly the whole story is different without really changing the world it's in.

Add on top of that the frustrations that are actually critical parts of the story in the later half of the series (Umbridge, the ministry in general, the bulk of the horcrux hunt, etc) and on top of that some meta-contextual frustrations (main male protag and main female protag don't end up together, Ron and Ginny's roles in the movies coloring how they're viewed in the books, Dumbledore being much harsher and more Gambon-ish in the public consciousness). These things don't make the source material less enjoyable to read for many people (although it clearly does for some based on what I've read around here), but it can make thinking about the series a bit dissatisfying. And that spurs people into finding that satisfaction elsewhere, creating the demand for fanfic.

There are a staggering number of HP fanfics that just rewrite the whole series, and so many of them are written with this backhanded salty tone towards how the scenes they rewrote played out in canon. And I think that saltiness comes from fans with literary blue-balls just wanting things to ease their frustrations that built up from the canon.

I don't keep up with MCU fanfics, but I wouldn't guess that there will ever be as many fics that completely rewrite Iron Man or Captain America's whole arc from their first movie through Endgame as there are multi-million-word HP Fics that completely start the series over with one thing changed. Those MCU characters and movies aren't going to have that same level of frustration because they were written in a way that's more satisfying to an older teen/adult from the outset, and the decisions about where to take things were done in a way so as to appeal to the largest number of people. So while there are definitely a lot of moments people can think to inject their own stories into, there's just fewer moments where people are watching and thinking "Yeah, but what if..." compared to Harry Potter. The demand isn't going to be there.

the internet was blowing up at the same time, the mcu is massive but people who watch movies are not the same kind of people who would read fanfiction of said movies

though there is a few mcu fanfics

Harry potter leaves more room for exploration due to its fantasy nature the various houses, and the vague lore.

add into the fact that after the last movie finished there was no harry potter content for a decade

** I think one of the things that hasn't yet been mentioned here is the wait between the books. After GoF and OotP, especially there was enough time for authors and to explore the universe for fun while they were waiting. I'm exploring some "classic fics" that I remember, and there is a lot of alt year 5, 6, and 7 books. But this is more than just fanfic, this discussion and (sometimes nasty) debate was the basis for the fan community. I was first involved in the fandom not so much to read fanfic, but to discuss plot and theory. It's been almost 15 years, and I am still friends with some of those people today. I joined this sub, looking for a similar community. This has turned the fandom into a large fanfic community, but since speculation is at the heart of it rather than just writing what happens next, I think that is why it keeps growing.

The majority of FF writers in general are female by a large percentage.

I dont have any stats to back this up but I'd say that there's a lot more women that read Harry Potter as well so that's a strong contributor to why the MCU hasn't really become a contender for fanfiction stories like HP.
