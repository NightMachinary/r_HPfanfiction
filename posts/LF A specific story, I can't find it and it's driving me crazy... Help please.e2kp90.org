:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It's a Harry in first year fiction. Where Quirrell interacts closely with Harry, and helps him a lot with schoolwork and other things. Harry is in Slytherin I think and Draco is his friend. Also there is a scene where Quirrell is pissed that he can't find the Mirror of Erised and Harry tells him where to find it, because he came across it while wondering around... Also if I remember correctly the Malfoys adopt Harry.


** Help finding a specific story should have the *"What's that Fic?"* flair.

*Request* is for when you want story recommendation based on an idea or topic.
