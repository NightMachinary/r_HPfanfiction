** That's not how time travel works in the HP Universe, when a person travels forward in time their body ages to how far into the future they travelled.

Example if a person from the HP universe travelled a hundred years into the future, their body would age a hundred years.

*** Considering that the source for this is Pottermore, and that JK said Cursed Child is also canon, we immediately have two very different canon mechanisms of time travel.

I think it's fair play to take this angle for a fic and not even in the realms of AU.

***** Fair... forgot about that. Although I assumed that OP was trying to have a story about someone time travelling back and forth while there were negligent effects on them timewise.

**** I love when people are like: "How dare you use your imagination and make magic work how you need to write your fanfiction. I have a questionable link to a 3rd party site that says this isn't possible in canon."

God forbid anyone be creative and have fun in the sub. This is why we end up with the same stories written over and over.
