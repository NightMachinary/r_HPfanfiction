Looking for fanfictions that are just... really good. Long reads would be preferred. By "good" I mean, of course, well written, good grammar (I can't stand it when their and there are confused) and a creative storyline. No specific romantic character matchups necessary but some romance is always appreciated. Any suggestions appreciated!


** Not really much to go on, but I'll reccommend a few.

The Denarian Renegade and its sequels are a crossover with the Dresden Files, but you don't need any knowledge of the series to understand it. It has a darker harry who is a bit of a dick but he does get better over time. He picks up a coin that is a vessel for a fallen angel and he becomes a Denarian, able to use Hellfire and such. It is a very well-written fic (for fanfiction) and I would reccommend it if his character doesn't ruin it for you.

Wastelands of Time and its sequel are epic fanfictions that are extremely well-written and I can't reccomend them enough.

Honour Thy Blood is a good fanfic about Harry being saved and trained by his great-uncle. I liked it when I read it.

  Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts with Hermione for eighth year, he realises that something's missing from his life, and it either has to do with Ron, his boggart, Snape, or Malfoy. Furthermore, what, exactly, does it mean when one's life is defined by the desire to simultaneously impress and annoy a portrait? Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care.

  Wolfstar Games 2020 - Team Sound / Prompt: typewriter “Lupin didn't seem pleased that I was filming last night,” Sirius said lightly.“Most people that come here...” Lily spoke slowly, choosing her words carefully, “Remus put it like this to me once: most people who choose to spend years of their life so far from civilization have a reason for leaving it behind. Remus wanted someone like us and he held out for so long because he expected he would get sent a bunch of finicky artsy types. I don't think he expected you. And now that you're here, I don't think he quite knows what to do with you.”  When wildlife filmmaker Sirius Black arrives on a remote Antarctic island for a year-long assignment, he isn't phased by the freezing wind, the perpetual darkness, or the hostility he meets from some of the biologists at the research base. He is used to living an itinerant existence. He is comfortable with unforgiving conditions. He expects the world to treat him harshly. But he does not expect to fall in love.

  Lavender takes one step forward and -- just like the snap of a finger, the blink of an eye, the drop of a pebble -- Hogwarts is left behind. There's no jump, no flashes of light, no whirlwinds of disconnected images. Just one little step; behind stood her war and in front stands 1947. "Huh," she says to herself, "didn't see this in the tea leaves."

  COMPLETE. When Harry and Hermione inadvertently tumble half a century into the past, they find themselves in the same year as the notorious Head Boy, Tom Riddle. Both Harry and Hermione's courage will be tested when they are confronted by chances of romance from the most unexpected of places, and unlikely enemies hiding in the tallgrass.Lost in the past, they may well forget the way home.Not DH compliant.

  Harry's absolutely sure it's Malfoy's fault that they are stuck reliving the same day over and over.Harry is good at his job. He's professional, has an excellent closure rate, and is a well-respected Auror. Malfoy's the unprofessional one with his snark and his judgemental eyebrows and his far too-posh-for-work robes. If Malfoy could have managed to refrain from being a pain in the arse, everything would have been just fine. They wouldn't have gotten in yet another argument, Harry wouldn't have been distracted, and Harry certainly wouldn't have accidentally set off a powerful artifact at their crime scene. And if Malfoy would just get out of his way now, Harry's sure he can quickly fix this so they can get back to their comfortable professional dislike of one another.

#+begin_quote
  When Sirius runs away in 1976, Regulus starts writing him letters he never intends to send. They're simply a way to talk about all the things he can't say out loud to anyone - a chronicle of his descent into the Death Eaters, and the eventual realisation that he made all the wrong choices. In 1997, Harry is searching for the Locket-Horcrux at Grimmauld Place. Instead, he finds a stack of yellowed parchment that not only tells a tale that's more captivating than it has any right to, but might also hold the key to information on the remaining Horcruxes. Regulus Black installed a failsafe. Though neither Regulus, nor Harry, Hermione, Ron, and Sirius expected the result of the ritual to be quite this literal. With an Ex-Death Eater who was assumed to be dead in their midst, the Horcrux-hunt goes a bit differently. Regulus is mostly conflicted if his unexpected second chance is really worth all the trouble his company keeps putting him in.   Spoiler: It is. He just likes to complain.

  Dora allows it, because she thinks it's sex. That's what Remus tells her, tells himself, tries to tell Sirius. It's physical, and only that, something the wolf needs and needs to take but not something Remus needs, oh no. Remus suspects that deep down ― or possibly not even that deep ― Dora knows that it's more, knows that Sirius is under Remus's skin and inside his bones in a way that one fuck a month can't even begin to sate. But if she has more to say on the matter, she has yet to say it. Remus knows enough about repression to guess that silence doesn't really mean there isn't something to say, and the weight of that feels heavy enough to bury him.

*** It may be worth noting that the summary often gives people a mistaken impression of it; I initially thought it would have soap opera levels of drama. That's not it at all, though. A better option for gauging whether you'll like it is to just read chapter 1 and decide whether you like Abby.

** Purely based on spelling, grammar, and complex plot, I'd have to point out Methods of Rationality. It's pretty divisive, though; personally I found it funny and quite thought-provoking, but plenty of people don't enjoy it because of Harry's arrogance and the author's strong opinions on utilitarian ethics. I do recommend reading the first ten chapters or so and deciding for yourself; linkffn(Daystar's Remix of HPMoR) is a good starting point.

linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) series is definitely long, and has a very creative plot, though only the first four books are complete yet. The author has made Harry clever and powerful for her age, but still entirely capable of making eleven-year-old mistakes and getting into trouble way over her head. It draws on elements of canon HP and the Song of the Lioness, without just repeating either one; it is its own story. Also features lots of great deadpan humour, and positive depictions of all four Houses - which doesn't stop each year from having high stakes. There are hints of future romance, but no pairing for Harry yet.

  Fan edit of the first few chapters of LessWrong's Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality to smooth out tone/characterization, and make it more accessible to those not familiar with Harry Potter canon.

** I highly recommend Pandemic. Incredible story line and beautifully written. Maybe start with [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29158347][Hold the Line]]. If you like it try the rest of the series.
