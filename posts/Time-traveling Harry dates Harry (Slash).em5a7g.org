:END:
A slash fiction I can't find anymore where Harry realizes that no-one can understand him more than himself. He decides to go back in time to protect past Harry from the pain and loss he had to face in the war. While there, he takes control of the war and became sort of a bodyguard for Harry. I remember that he takes the name Orion Black while posing as a bodyguard at Hogwarts. Has it been deleted? Is there methods for retrieving it?
