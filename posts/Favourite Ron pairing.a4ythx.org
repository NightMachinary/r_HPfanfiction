There have been multiple threads in the past, asking people who they prefer to pair Harry or Hermione with. So I thought I'd ask the same question for Ron. Which character do you like to see him romantically involved with the most?


** I'm fine with Ron/Hermione but don't 'ship' it in the way one might get invested in other pairings. It feels like a plausible romance to me, but I just don't particularly get invested. Of course, that's because Ron isn't really a compelling protagonist; he's a great side character, but he lacks a certain /je-ne-sais-quoi/ that makes Harry, Hermione, or even other secondary characters like Luna all seem like good choices for a main character.

Simply due to how real their friendship felt in the books, Harry/Ron is probably one of the only slash pairings I can easily see happening if everything but Harry and Ron's romantic orientations remained unchanged in the setting. But I haven't ever come across a fic with such a pairing that is otherwise to my taste, so this is kind of academic.

I know Ron/Luna has some traction, and... I mean, yeah, sure? It can be written well and be very sweet. It just always feels to me like the pairing mostly exists to "pair up the spares" once you've shipped Harry with Hermione, as opposed to something heartfelt. But a great story may come one day to prove me wrong.

*** I don't think Ron/Luna could ever work. Primarily because I can't imagine Ron taking her passions seriously. If she were to ever start a tangent about the creatures she pursues, Ron would probably roll his eyes and not pay attention. And even without that issue in mind, I don't think Luna would be willing to put up with his attitude.

**** The most disturbing part about Ron/Luna is that pretty much every story romanticises this behaviour and Ron is a good boyfriend for letting her "prattle on". So basically Luna is monologuing and Ron is awesome because he is in the general vicinity.

**** Thanks, I'll give them a try --- but the problem is that the sort of fic I like /isn't/ romance. What I'd like is a good general fic with an interesting premise of its own, which happens to have Harry/Ron as its pairing later on.

***** That's kind of what Or the Look or the Words (first fic [[/u/RushingRound][u/RushingRound]] recommended) is. The romance isn't the central focus the whole time, it just builds naturally as the plot progresses. Though to be fair that story is light on plot and heavy on friendship and cuteness.

** I think in canon Ron was THE one factor that kept Hermione from being a complete Mary Sue and therefore I like this pairing, even though I think they do not fit together all that well.

I think character wise Draco and Ron would make an absolutely amazing pairing, because they share the same insecurities and getting them together would be an amazingly twisted angst fest, something which I really like. They also both have parents that were not actually good parents at all, but are widely perceived as if they were. A fic working with that would be amazing. I am of course aware that this pairing is not exactly realistic, but I tend to ignore that reading ff anyway. I have never actually read a good story with the two of them, so if anyone has a rec, I would be delighted.

I think Ron got by far the shortest stick in canon and I hate what was done to his character. Ron would need someone who really really adores him and makes him feel like he is someone special for once, yet is awesome enough for him to feel like he has won a prize he does not deserve with his life partner.

I do not think such a character exists in canon.

**** My god, Hellstrike, something just occurred to me. I read one of your comments, in which you said that any pairing with Malfoy would have to happen before the "mudblood incident", something that Malfoy parroted when he was 12. That means you judge a 12yo like you would judge an adult. Therefore you can not be much older yourself. It makes so much sense now. Of course you think 12-17yo kids are fully responsible, when you yourself are in that age range. I do not know if I should be sorry for being so harsh on you, you do not ever try to see the other side of the coin, which is super annoying to me and I think you should get honest feedback. But yeah, you will learn, of course. I always assume automatically that everyone here is at least 20, so sorry for judging you more harshly than I usually would, I guess.

***** You are missing the point of that argument. There is no criminal liability or anything resulting from that. But at that point, Malfoy causes a lot of water under the bridge, creates a rift which cannot be mended, one he widens a lot during the third year where he pushes for Buckbeaks execution. That moment is a very good character indication because Malfoy is gleeful how Hagrid suffers. He is not just "parroting" something there, he is the driving force (he caused the incident, he made a huge deal out of an injury which was healed within an hour, his reaction is the reason why Daddy Malfoy and his Death Eater Chum got involved).

Do you really think that the founder of SPEW and "I made a mistake, so this sentient animal has to die" Malfoy would get along? That after the war Hermione could even hear the name Malfoy without suffering from PTSD after what Bellatrix did to her at MALFOY Manor while the Malfoys watched? That Hermione would remember anything but her childhood torment from the boy who called her "magical nigger" for five years?

But of course, I made the mistake of assuming that everyone here is at least twenty and understands something about romantic compatibility and traumatic memories.

** I don't have any strong feelings about Ron's pairings. I'm fine with Ron/Hermione, but don't mind Ron/Lavender or even the idea of Ron/Pansy. I never slash Ron because he seems like the straightest rod ever made in the factory, barring his little crush on Viktor back in the day. I think a really feminine quidditch fan (not player) would work well for him, probably an older woman.

#+end_quote

A background character (like Parvati or Susan Bones) because there was not a single canon character with whom he had any chemistry. Therefore it is up to the author to create such a character.

He and Hermione had absolutely nothing in common outside of the war and Harry. No shared interests, completely opposite character traits, neither really take the other seriously and they don't pull their punches when arguing. And the whole "lets mind rape a driving instructor to get laid" thing won't fly with Hermione at all if she ever finds out.

Lavender did not work out in canon, so that's a no as well.

Ron, for most of the books, was too insensitive for Luna, although there is a case to be made on the last third of HBP (after he was poisoned). I'm not convinced, but it is perhaps the "lesser evil".

**** Hermione challenged Ron to pass a driving exam without magic, he cheated and used magic on the instructor because he would have otherwise failed the exam, casually violating several laws (using magic on Muggle without due cause, using magic in front of muggles, fraud).

It is reasonable to assume that Hermione would express her pride at his accomplishment...

Honestly, if you want to put a finger on the single scene which makes Ron a horrible character, there you go. And he sees nothing wrong with that, despite the fact that he casually assaults a muggle and even confesses the whole thing to an Auror (and Harry is horrible in that scene because he doesn't even point out how wrong Ron's action was).

Edit: To make things clear, the "Ron is a horrible character" statement is solely about the epilogue. Other than that, I'm indifferent towards him, but that one scene is enough to ruin his entire character. His modus operandi is not different from a Death Eater there (who would have used the imperius but otherwise acted the same).

** I honestly find most pairings involving Ron to be rather gross. Mostly due to his character flaws --- he's not the kind of person I'd want someone I actually like to date. Most egregious of this are R/H and R/L, even if these days I find Hermione to be a bit annoying. So it would have to be someone I have no strong feelings on whatsoever, while still being a decent pairing for him.

Unironically, I feel like Lavender would be this if she were actually written well.

That said? I usually prefer to keep him background at best.
