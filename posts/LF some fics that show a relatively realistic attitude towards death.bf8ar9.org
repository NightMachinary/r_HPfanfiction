Especially in first year after Harry (accidentally) kills Quirrel. Are there any fics you can recommend that have Harry reacting to having killed someone at age 11?


** Book Harry didn't kill Quirrel. Quirrel was absolutely responsible for his own death there (discounting that he was already doomed to die because he let Voldemort sublet his head).

Movie Harry, on the other hand, deliberately and absolutely killed the fuck out of Quirrel, and that's never followed up on.

*** Well only Dumbledore really knew about it and he probably just thought "Good to see the chosen one's up to the task, that sacrificial love protection is everything I hoped it could be and he clearly knows how to use it".
