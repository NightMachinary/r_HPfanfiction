** Gosh, this has caused a lot of arguing about who would win in muggles vs wizards.

I suppose I could drop my own take in on things. I actually thought quite a bit about this subject a while back; the conclusion I came to was, magicals are great on offence, but doomed on defence.

To be precise, wizards (by which I mean wizards, witches, house-elves, and whatever other magical creatures might be so-inclined to help them out) have the ability to Apparate, set up Portkeys, Floo connections, lots of ways that can move them from one side of the country to the other in seconds.

And, they have shrinking charms, and undetectable expansion charms. In fact, they have charms for everything, and if they ever don't have something they need they can conjure or transfigure it.

In short, wizards have unparalleled logistical capability. They can go anywhere, strike anywhere, and retreat from anywhere, at any time. Their only weakness in that area seems to be, if the Divination class at Hogwarts is any indication, they can't scry for targets or otherwise use remote viewing, and their future sight is sketchy at best.

Nevertheless, all this makes for tremendous offensive power, and makes wizards particularly suited to hit-and-run tactics; find a target, blow them up or Imperius them for later use, get out before defences can even begin to mobilise.

** 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section-1
   :END:
However! What wizards have in tremendous offence, they lack in defence; their best protection is obscurity through concealment charms, obliviation, et-cetera. Wizards defending one of their bases, should it be exposed, don't have the advantage of being able to run away that Apparation and such give them; they have to fight, or they lose the territory.

When it comes to wizard vs wizard, attackers have the definite advantage, being able to quickly split and recombine their forces to attack an extremely wide area at once, forcing the defenders to either spread their own forces thin, or lose ground.

This is why, I figure, Voldemort was able to take the Ministry; his personal power aside, he and his followers were free to move as they wished, attack whenever opportunity presented itself, while the Aurors, without knowledge of where Voldemort's own base was, were limited to only reacting.

By the same token, when Voldemort's forces massed to attack Hogwarts, that was a major tactical error; all grouping up together, in a place they couldn't Apparate away from safely, made Voldemort's Death Eaters and other followers extremely vulnerable, to the point that only their extreme numbers (barely) let them win initially, and they were wiped out when reinforcements came to help Hogwarts.

   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section-2
   :END:
Now, this is only a hypothesis, but I think that if muggles were somehow able to detect a place where wizards were operating from, they would quite easily be able to destroy it with their bombs and other weapons.

It's simply a matter of kinetic energy overwhelming any and all defences; if wizarding wards could actually withstand infinite amounts of non-magical force, wizards would have said eff gravity and built all their castles on the moon by now.

That said, unless muggles implement their own security-by-obscurity, concealing where their commanders are or in extreme cases concealing /who/ they are, they have little to no chance against any wizards willing to use both legilmency and the Imperius.

   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section-3
   :END:
So yeah, that's the order of things. Muggles can overwhelm any magical defence, but wizards can bypass any muggle defence; the only way for either side to protect anything is by keeping it classified.

Some other things I'd like to note; at Hogwarts and other schools like it, students go to learn the theory and practice of magic, magical creatures breed true, and Snape explicitly calls potions a 'science'.

Everything we see in the Harry Potter books suggests that magic is observable, and reproducible, and therefore testable. Even if magic doesn't obey known particle physics, there's nothing (except potentially a lack of samples) stopping muggle scientists from researching magical phenomena and trying to harness it or at least learn how to counter or compensate for it, especially if they get a muggleborn wizard helping them.

Another thing I'd like to note is that not necessarily the entire magical world would fight against muggles; if it came to a war, various magical creatures, especially goblins, might well stay neutral or even join the muggle side, and it's a safe bet that at least some muggleborn wizards would join the muggle side of things and help said muggles rapidly increase their understanding of their enemy. Even the humble Puffskein would be a goldmine of biological and magical information.

Vice versa, plenty of Muggles were willing to ally with Wizards to go after their own Muggle enemies.

I think in the end, it would stil come down as country vs country, ideology vs ideology, and religion vs religion.

If words got out that Russians or Chinese were colluding with their Wizards, I think even most US religious fundies would reach out to their fellow American Wizards.

Chinese Wizards might also hate British Wizards far more than their own Muggles, especially since China NEVER had institutional witch hunts like in Europe.

** Royally effed? Bombs are hardly going to be a suprise to them after WW2, Internet wasn't particularly impressive back in hp books time, and flying to the moon while impressive could probably be replicated with magic, so they're not going to go into shock because of it. Although i can see modern internet being an issue for the Statute of Secrecy.

I've read a few fics (can't remember the names, sry) where the muggles charged into diagon alley, gunz blazing and mowed down all the hillbillies who just stood there trying to say abracadabra. Which is in my opinion really poorly done. More realistic outcome should be a few invisible wizards using confundus charm until the muggles kill eachother. After all, while the combat magic in HP wasn't particularly effective, the more subtle stuff they had there, was kind of scary when you think of the potential uses. (Imperius the government, surround a major city with muggle repelling charms and watch them starve etc).

Sorry if i'm a bit ranty and somewhat off topic, but the mugglewank fics are becoming a pet peeve of mine. linkffn(7224755)

** Where do people get the idea that muggles can beat magicals in a war?

They won't be royally fucked. Bombs and such would hardly surprise wizards, due to World Wars I and II. Pretty much all muggle achievements and technology, can, in some form, be replicated by magic. Sure, it's fanon magic, but certainly possible nevertheless. Why be worried about bombs when you can invisibly place volatile potions that are rigged to blow, and thus destroy the muggles' ability to /cough/ bomb Diagon Alley, for example? Furthermore, I'd be shocked if somebody didn't create a ward that neutralized the effects of muggle weaponry. And if I were a wizard fighting muggles armed with machine guns, I wouldn't stand in a fucking field and take it. I'd make myself invisible and then throw Mandrakes at them, or get on a broom and blow them up with a blasting curse, or drop Erumpent horns on them. You can't shoot somebody you can't see.

I agree with [[/u/Triflez]], mugglewank stories are poorly done and highly unrealistic.

#+end_quote

I thought we were supposed to forget fanon. It's fanon thing that wizards are stuck in time. Canonically they progress both magically and socially. Good thing I've already written a rant about it and only need to copy-paste relevant fragments.

My favourite way to describe HP magic is a separate layer of reality ruled by it's own laws and interacting with mundane layer. Due to fact that "wizards (...) have the power to correct or override 'mundane' nature, but not 'magical' nature" (from Pottermore: Illness and disability) we can assume that magical layer is more important that mundane layer, thus study of laws of magic replaces study of laws of mundane reality (physics, chemistry, biology and so on) and progress in terms of spellcasting, potioneering, etc. replaces technological progress based on mundane sciences.

The existence of scholarly journals like Transfiguration Today, Challenges in Charming, and the The Practical Potioneer (all mentioned in DH in context of submitting papers), and the fact that there are several books on Summoning Charm alone (GotF) and there are many more books in giant Hogwart's library and existence of DoM support that there is ongoing research on magic.

There is even more in terms of creations of new spells and potions. Until Alohomora was adopted in Britain in XVII century, there were more crude spells used (Wonderbook: Book of Spells), Mending Charm was created in XVIII century (Wonderbook: Book of Spells). Snape created his own, new spells (HBP), Zygmunt Budge created Felix Felicis in XVI century (Wonderbook: Book of Potions), and Wolfsbane Potion was created in the second half of XX century (Pottermore: Werewolves).

In social matters the females among being chosen as Ministers for Magic from end of XVII onwards, choice of muggleborn Nobby Leach as a Minister in 1962 or Squib Rights marches in late sixties. (Pottermore: Minister for Magic)

Fanfiction tends to nerf magic a lot. Potterverse magic is absurdly powerful. Of course most of wizards are fairly incompetent, but even someone like Crabbe was able to cast Fiendfyre.

I mean, aside from what [[/u/Satanniel][u/Satanniel]] has already said, there's also the fact that canon Muggles are not the same as IRL Muggles either. They're stupid as hell. We're told several times of magical effects that wizards don't even bother to actively conceal (such as the Knight Bus) because the Muggles who witness them refuse to believe what they have seen. It's even suggested in Quidditch Through the Ages to be a kind of magical phenomenon in and of itself - Muggle inability to believe in the supernatural even when they see it.

*** " I'd make myself invisible"

Thermal imaging would ruin that tactic quickly.

"Throw Mandrakes at them"

That is a double edged sword. Earmuffs can be removed or shot off, killing wizards as well as muggles. Not to mention Mandrakes are implied to be rare, seeing as how they had to wait for months for Professor Sprout's Mandrakes to mature, rather than Dumbledore purchasing some, and we don't know just how large an actual Mandrake is. (It's probably a bit to big to feasibly use in combat)

"or get on a broom and blow them up with a blasting curse"

Brooms can't fly anywhere near as fast as actual aircraft, you could easily enough shoot those down, not to mention that they're made of wood.

"drop Erumpent horns"

Those are hilariously unstable, to the point that just hitting the ground causes them to explode. It would be nearly impossible to stably carry them to the point of dropping them on a muggle (Not to mention them getting shot by soldiers)

The wizards wouldn't have an advantage past the opening of the war when muggles learn a few of their tricks. Thermal Imaging would be quickly employed by muggles, not to mention the numerical advantage muggles would have, or muggleborns siding with the muggles over wizards.

Just like how mugglewank stories are poorly done and highly unrealistic, so too are stories where wizards shit all over the muggles.

How do you know so confidently that theremal imaging would help? It is the exactly same physics - just not with wavelengths that we can see.

And also, you forget mind-magic completely. That is the dangerous part. If you imperius a few heads of state you can do a tremendous amount of damage. If you do it with their subordinates as well, even more.

And even if that is impossible: You could simply take out the energy grid (Explode a few transformers, put muggle-aversion charms around) and the muggles will struggle to keep each other alive.

Muggles are extremely vulnerable - why do you think the big countries stopped fighting on their own soil? I mean, just look at what a nuclear strike would do.

If both sides are competent, then there will be extremely heavy losses on both sides.

(somehow despite no canon evidence to contribute to such a spell even being possible) too bad they still make noise from a fast object moving through the air, and Muffliato and Silencio don't work that way. Standard Flak rounds alone would dissuade most wizards and witches from their target unless they were legitimately insane.

Just listening for the sound wouldn't be as effective, but it would work until they came up with a tactic to get around it.

Even if wizards could make a spell like that, Muggles would win through attrition. It's not mugglewank, it's simple numbers.

How to you differentiate a wizard from a random dude in a city? Sure they dress wierldy but thats more of them not caring than real ignorance, in a war they would just start putting muggle soldiers and even civilians under the imperius and then sending them in as suicide troopers. OR have the imperiused soldiers lure more soldiers and officers to mind control. Apparating would give them extreme mobility and glamors and transfigurations would make blending in and infiltration even easier. Wizards wouldnt sling spells at a machine gunner, wizards would mind control an artillery unit and have IT blow the machine gunner up.

In canon Voldemort blew up a bridge, i would imagine that destroyng roads and bridges would stop any tanks from being a issue. It would also make it difficult to supply cities with food, and many would starve. I'm thinking morale would quickly go down on muggle side.

Oh i just tought how wizards could take down a tank line in direct combat. Tell the dementors its omnom time. The unkillable soul eating monstosities that are invisible to muggles and mess people up by proximity.

Besides as to aircraft the aren't exactly without collateral and the minstry of magic for example is underneath London. What are the odds that theres something important just above it?

In canon you can animate statues or transfigure creatures and send them on to fight while the wizard stays away.

Anyway this is getting way too long, but the point is Wizards can be scary with a little creativity and war is a lot more than throwing bodies at eachother after all, USA having one of the most powerful militaries in the world can't pacify insurgents in the real world, why would the muggles do any better against wizards?

******** Of course it does, because Muggles need a certain level of deterrent to prevent a complete takeover by Wizards.

The reason Wizards went into hiding the first place meant they feared Muggles to a certain degree. I don't buy those foul excuses such as "we don't want to rule Muggles...". It's human nature to abuse their own power as much as they can. I have absolutely no illusion about that.

And we are talking about fanfics here, where MANY readers do NOT want to restrict the stories to Magical Britain or Magical World alone.

  Do you really believe that those creature attacks are more powerful than, let's say 50mm caliber machine guns, anti-tank missiles able to penetrate 1000mm of reinforced steel, 155mm HE artillery shells, and 1000 lbs HE bombs?

Those creatures are magical, whereas those weapons aren't.

** We don't have enough reference to know which would be better. We don't know how resistant shield charms are to bullets, we don't know how long it would take to make new anti-tech spells (radar proofing, automatic bomb-vanishing enchantments, animated mines to blow up tanks etc) or what anti-magic strategies will even work (psychological tests to detect mind tampering, computer programs that detect anomalies in maps caused by unplottable enchantments (do protective enchantments (wards in fanon) even protect against computers?), ways to detect disillusionment charms/invisibility cloaks etc). We don't even know why too much magic stops technology from working, what it stops from working (just electricity or any mechanism that's too complicated) or how much magic is too much.

We do know that wizards are advancing (there's an experimental charms division in the MoM, Quiddich through the Ages talks about how much brooms have advanced since they were first made etc) and that they do know about some Muggle technology (the MoM own cars; the Weasleys use them in the third book) and have even made some of it part of their society (Wizarding Wireless Network from radio, one of the Weird Sisters (popular Wizarding band) plays the bass guitar).

Tl;Dr, we don't know enough to definitively say which is better and wizards aren't completely ignorant of technology.

*** This is pretty much correct. Many of the important questions can only be debated with speculation and not enough hard facts. Personally, I think Rowling hints that Magic works in such a way that will severely disadvantage the muggle side. She talks about things like magic overriding mundane nature, muggles being somewhat intrinsically disbelieving of magic, etc. However, whether that can be taken literally and how it affects every little scenario is up to debate.

** Not much muggles can do when they literally cannot enter/see certain areas and can have their minds wiped, manipulated, read or controlled easily.

Maybe using pure power the muggles can bomb/nuke the shit out of something assuming they can figure out where it is, but they can never eradicate witches/wizards because the infiltration power of magic is too strong.

*** Well, now I wonder. Just how far could Fiendfyre spread if nobody around was capable of whatever magic was required to stop it?

It apparently can't burn through stone, so that's good and all, but could it consume the entire atmosphere? Could it vaporise water and use it as fuel? Would it be able to survive in space without oxygen?
