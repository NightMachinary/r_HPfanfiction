After living through a war, one could reasonably suspect that Ron graduated from teaspoon to soup ladle at least. I'm looking for fics in which he shows maturity, is a good boyfriend to Hermione and best friend to Harry, doesn't have an insane blow out to finding out his little sister has a sex life etc.

Preferrably with canon pairings.


** I'm starting to feel a little bad about recommending my own story so many times lately, but that's exactly the Ron I'm trying to write:

If you'd like a much older version, he's also in this one:

*** Ha! I started reading After Destiny yesterday, and I liked the way you wrote Ron which brought me here to ask for more :)

Have you published it on AO3 or FF.net? I'd love to be able to subscribe to it and not miss an update.

**** Some of my stories are on AO3, but so far After Destiny has been an exclusive at HPFanFicTalk to try to help build readership for the new community. If update notifications are a feature readers would like, I'll suggest it to the site admins.

Thank you for reading!
