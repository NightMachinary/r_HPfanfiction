Sometimes fanfiction writers don't know how to off him and struggle big time. What's the worst way you've seen Voldemort die?


** The one that really sticks in my mind:

When Voldemort used Harry's blood in his resurrection potion, he also received Harry's dubious family medical history. Yep, Voldemort died from diabetes complications and acute onset Alzheimer's.

** To divert Dumbledore (who's moderately senile) from preventing people from doing anything useful, McGonagall concocts a clever plan. She has Harry fabricate some visions suggesting that Voldemort has a specific weakness.

So Dumbledore withdraws from his other responsibilities. He uses every bit of alchemical knowledge at his disposal. He uses his vast knowledge of magic to construct a specialized charm. And after many months, he produces an item based on these faked visions. And he deploys it against Voldemort.

But it turns out, Voldemort actually /was/ diabetic and allergic to citrus, just as the faked visions implied. And as soon as the Lemon Drop of Doom touched his lips, he exploded.

There's a giant purple double decker bus where Voldemort and Dumbledore were just standing. Correction, a giant purple and red-splashed double decker bus.
