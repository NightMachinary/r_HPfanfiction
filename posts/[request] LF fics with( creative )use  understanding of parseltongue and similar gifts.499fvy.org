Most fics glance over the use of parseltongue, but some I remember had Harry being able to understand say Dragons to the same degree as maybe someone Spanish understands Italian. Are there any other good fics with interesting uses? Maybe understanding all reptiles or using parseltongue more intensely or maybe animagi being able to learning an animals language or something? Or a deeper, more meaningful interaction?


** Linkffn(To Shape and Change) involves healing with parselmagic.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

  Nothing is as it seems on the path to power. Bodies and conspiracies litter the road as daggers shine in the air. Treacheries centuries old leave the place to decade long plans that are just now coming to fruition, and Harry Dursley questions himself through a journey that shall lead him to drastically change his perception of the world. It's all a matter of perspective, after all.

** [[http://keiramarcos.com/fan-fiction/harry-potter/harry-potter-the-soulmate-bond/][Harry Potter and the Soulmate Bond]] (site requires signup to view fics)

- parseltongue conclave
- Parselmagic healing
- Adder stones
- Multiple snake familiars/pets (with amusingly distinct personalities)
- Personal parseltongue dialect
- Snake animagus forms

However, as the title indicates, the focus of the story is the relationship, so it's not to everyone's taste. The author freely admits Harry is a little Harry-Stu-ish, since she wrote it in her early twenties before editing and posting significantly later. But it's very well-written.

Edited to fix list formatting

**** This one is also long (saw your comment above). But her writing is very episodic - each of those "chapters" is 10-15K, and somewhat standalone. No chapter-end cliffhangers, at any rate. If you're not entertained by the end of the first part, it might not be for you. But the first one is worth reading for the first night at Hogwarts.
