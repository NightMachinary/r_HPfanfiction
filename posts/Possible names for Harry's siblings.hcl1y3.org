So I have read a lot of fics where Harry has a sibling. It's usually WBWl fics but there are also a lot of other fics where he has a sibling. Some of their names are absolutely ridiculous while some of them sound pretty normal. What do you think would most likely be Harry's sibling's names if he had them?


** Pretty normal.

And by this, I mean /normal by British standards for a person in these circles/. There is this great scene in PS where Petunia sniffs that Harry is a /common/ name, and that kind of reaction has all sorts of connotations about class, station and what Petunia considers herself to be (and ironically, in truth, isn't). She's not (only) saying that it's a name many people have, but more relevantly, that she considers it a lower-class name, while the reader is supposed to know /it's actually not/. It's part of this ignorant, pretend-to-be-something-better upper-middle class snobbery Rowling was portraying with the Dursleys. If you don't have a British background or some more extensive exposure through books or other mediums, I suspect that scene falls flat.

But yeah, in any case, names of similar calibre would be Richard or Edward, for example, I guess.

*** I never knew this before! Thanks for the info.

I used to think the first chapter of Philosopher's stone was a bit bland but I guess I missed a lot of references to everyday British life in there.

** Sam, Ben, Jack, Jacob, Nicholas, Chris\\
Amy, Jill, Natalie, Emily, Sarah, Helen (alternatively, floral names such as Daisy, Rose, Jasmine, etc to go with the Lily-Petunia theme - this depends on whether you think Lily would want to carry this theme on after the break with her sister)

Harry is a plain and unpretentious name. I think any sibling names would be the same. Nothing too modern or trendy, nothing too unusual.

** I like the flower theme. So Rose, Holly, Violet etc.

Harry and James are simple names. Names like Luke and Aaron would be my preference.

** From a Doylist Perspective I looked at where Rowling got the name Harry, she mentioned this in an Interview.

#+begin_quote
  Question: From where did you get the name for Harry Potter?

  Rowling: 'Harry' has always been my favourite boy's name, so if my daughter had been a son, he would have been Harry Rowling. Then I would have had to choose a different name for "Harry" in the books, because it would have been too cruel to name him after my own son. "Potter" was the surname of a family who used to live near me when I was seven years old and I always liked the name, so I borrowed it.
#+end_quote

So I would say Harry's sibling would likely be called Jessica or David, since those are the names of Rowlings first children, they also common enough like Harry.

** I've had a look at some 80's baby name list and had put some down, but I've found the [[https://www.babymed.com/baby-names/top-100-baby-names-england-and-wales-1984][100 most popular baby names in 1984]] (England and Wales) which I reckon is more useful.

Top 5 for each are:

Christopher (Chris), James, David (Dave), Daniel (Dan) and Michael (Mike). Plus a bonus Mathew as James is taken.

Sarah, Laura, Gemma, Emma and Rebecca.

To be honest, it's pretty much a selection of the 10 names I'd written out before.

*** Idk why but the thought of "Dave Potter" is making me howl with laughter.

Agree these are names that would go well with Harry - as would William, Charles, Edward, Richard, Alexander, Andrew, George etc - Harry is a royal name (as is James) so anything an English king or prince has had would be appropriate.

Something that really annoys me is the trope that his real name is Hadrian. Harry is short for Henry for god's sake, and Henry is a perfectly good name in any social circle. We didn't have eight kings called Henry for some upstart fanfic author to decide it's not a "posh" enough name for pureblood circles!

**** I feel like the only time Hadrian should be an acceptable "proper" name for Harry is if/when he's raised by the Malfoys, and only partly because both Lucius and Draco are Roman names.

******* True, but loads of Severus centric fics have him becoming "Lord Prince" because obviously every bloody pureblood family is super rich semi royalty. So I can see Harry in those circumstances being Hadrian. If it's a standard Severitus and they live in Snapes quarters or Spinners End, there's no need to change his name. Severus is not that pretentious.

I read one once where Sirius and Remus change Harry's name to Phoenix and it made me so irritated I couldn't read further.

**** Haha, me too. Every time its mentioned I briefly imagine him being a wall and then close the fic.

I'm pretty sure all those other names were on the 1984 list! So, yep. Perfect. I nearly put a note saying 'you could put Dave Potter, but...'

Trying to learn all the Henry's and Richard's was the bane of my history classes, until I realised I could just avoid that question on the paper.

I have a relative named Harry, after someone called Henry incidentally. Unfortunately my generation (not me, I have no children) have now looped back to, er, my grandparent's generation's nicknames and it's as ridiculous as you think.

** I was born in 1986 in the UK, so the right age and location to be a you get Potter sibling.

In my class at school we had Daniel, Stephen, Alex, Luke, John, Chris, Gary (Harry and Gary lol I can see James going for a rhyming theme), Mark, Mike, Tim, Tom, Will, Richard and Guy (one I can see James going for as well - Guy FAWKES geddit how cross would Albus be).

For the girls we had Sophie, Rachel, Chloe, Claire, Laura, Holly, Bryony, Charlotte, Kim, Jessica, Suzie, Sarah, Katie, Gemma, (we did have a couple of girls with more interesting names, including my own, but won't list them because of identifying characteristics) and would all be absolutely fine for a Potter sister, although I can also see Lily maybe going for a flower name (Rosie, Daisy etc)

*** I can imagine that's how 'Harry' came about. James absolutely refusing to have flower names after the travesty that is Petunia. Lily flinging back that she's not having a stuffy pureblood name like '/Fleamont/'.

Regardless of Fleamont or Charlus as the grandparent, I reckon Charlie would be a good name for a brother, a reference to James' family without taking the odd names. Harry could either be picked or someone from Lily's side. I could well imagine Petunia trying to distance herself entirely from her roots.

Makes it understandable why he named his son James.

** I would maybe research the potter family tree on Pottermore, With a lot of Rowlings work the kids seem To be named after ancestors Or Have the names of their parents as their middle names. So Reasonably you could probably use some of those names as the name of a sibling for Harry Potter, I wrote an OC older brother for Harry in a story a while back named Charlus, That's a name from the power family tree I think he would be James great uncle or something.
