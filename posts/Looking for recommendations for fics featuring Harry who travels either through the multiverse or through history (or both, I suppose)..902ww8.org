I've recently become quite fond of stories where Harry travels from dimension to dimension, such as The Professional's and Dunuelos's Lone Traveler series - linkffn(2673584), linkffn(5751435) and others - and Nonjon's Dimension Hopping for Beginners - linkffn(2829366).

I've also gotten to like similar stories where instead of through different dimensions, Harry travels within his own dimension's history - either one big jump back in time, like Rakeesh's A Long Journey Home - linkffn(9860311) - or in a series of discrete jumps.

In some of these stories, Harry is blessed (or cursed) with immortality, whereas in some he's just unusually detached from space and time. I don't have a preference as far as that goes, and I don't have one for pairings either (although slash isn't really my thing).

Has anybody read any good stories recently that sound like any of those? I'm trying to find as many as I can. Thanks!


** Harry thrown to the time of the Crusades. linkffn(6486247) Despite it being marked as an AC crossover, there are no AC elements aside from sharing the same time period.

*** That hasn't been updated since 2011 and is most likely abandoned. How dare you get me all excited about an epic fanfic and leave me with metaphorical blue balls?!?!?!?

I'm just playing but seriously it sucks when fics are abandoned. There should be an archive section on ffn for stories not marked complete that haven't been touched in 2 years maybe? Once the author updates if they ever come back to it, it would move out of the archive section.

** I'm not sure I understand what you want, but if I do then linkffn(time to put your galleons where your mouth is by tsume yuki) should be right up your alley.
