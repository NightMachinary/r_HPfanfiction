I remember a story where Harry traveled back in time into his younger body but made it look like he had a guardian. What I also remember is the fight with the Basilisk which happened in Hogsmead. I donÂ´t remember anything else. Can you guys think of a fanfic like that?


** Oh yeah! I'm pretty sure Harry was in the infirmary then used a time tuner to go back in time and fight the basilisk while everyone knew he was out of aktion.

** That sounds like the same story that theVennu101 asked about earlier today. It's called Harry Potter and the Children of Change by T. E. Tanglebrooke

*** I couldn't make it past chapter 9 because I found this Tonks and Hermione annoying as hell. I only made it that far because there were some really nice turns of phrase, but ultimately it was just not the story for me.
