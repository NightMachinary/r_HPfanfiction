JK Rowling created a wonderful universe for us and left a lot blank with regards to the rules of magic. With fanfiction this has been both a blessing and a curse. While some talented authors have come up with amazing explanations for how magic in general and in specific ways can work, in many fics this comes across as jarring, distracting, or irrelevant to the plot.

Are there any one-shots written in the form of chapters from in-universe books, lectures, discourses, etc. regarding the nature of magic? I feel like this would be a cool way to explore more of the magic of Harry Potter without having an unnecessary section of a fic where Harry buys a whole bunch of books so the author can share their ideas without progressing the plot.

In some ways I'm thinking of something like a fanfiction addition to the Hogwarts Library to go along with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, Quidditch Through the Ages, and Tales of Beedle the Bard.

I feel like it would be interesting to read a guide to the becoming an Animagus with notes by Sirius Black and James Potter, a study guide for the twelve uses of dragon blood, a tourist guide for magical attractions throughout Europe, a summary of the differences between European magic and Native American magic, and so on. I am not sure how popular this idea is already, but I haven't really come across any fics that follow this sort of premise yet.

I had some ideas for a discourse on Greco-Roman Magical History and how the Greek God's were titles passed down wizards and witches from Master to Apprentice, but I am not nearly confident enough in my writing or research ability to post anything.

What are your thoughts? Are there any fics that follow this premise? Is it a dumb idea that should never be mentioned again? Do you have your own mini magical lessons you have thought of or would like to see?

Taure wrote a chapter for the Beginner's Guide to Transfiguration. I thought it was somewhat interesting.

** That sounds like it would be interesting. I haven't run across anything like what you are describing before. I agree that the blanks left WRT how magic works is indeed a blessing and a curse. In my own works, I've had to really think about how it would make the most sense for a spell to work and it's been an interesting challenge.
