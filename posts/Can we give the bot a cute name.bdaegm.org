** Crabbe/Goyle, because it does whatever people ask it to, and manages to get it right /most/ of he time.

Or Hadrian, because if we are going to rename an important character it absolutely /HAS/ to be a cool edgy 1990's name. /What?/ The story is set in the 1990's and we are all reading it in 2000+? Pfft, who cares.

/Edited: Now I know how to italicise, that's sorted, I also added some line separators for readability/
