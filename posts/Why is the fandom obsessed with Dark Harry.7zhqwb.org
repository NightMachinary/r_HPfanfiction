** If you want a discussion you should really get it started. Define what you mean by dark Harry, what evidence do you have that suggests the fandom is obsessed. When you say 'fandom' do you mean FFN or this subreddit or maybe even DLP? Each has its own tastes. I would say on the whole this subreddit is rather against the majority of stories that label themselves darkHarry. On the whole they're thought of as shallow, low effort stories. Its not a fundamentally bad concept but the execution is so often way off the mark. Whenever there is an interesting idea but nobody has managed to execute right others try which might give the impression of this 'obsession' you're seeing.

*** Quite. Each section of the fandom definitely has their different tastes.

The fandom on Wattpad has a taste for stories where an OC pops in and changes fundamental aspects of Harry Potter, and I don't ever recall stumbling upon a Dark!Harry fic... except for that one fic where Harry was Voldemort's son, but that was when my tastes were underdeveloped.
