Hey does anyone know any good fan fic where harry has depression and does self harm but it doesn't involve Draco rescuing the day, maybe like Snape or McGonagall or someone rescuing? Sorry if that doesn't make sense. Thanks


** There are zillion of them, but first which came to my mind is “Digging for the Bones” by Paganaidd linkao3(598019). For me there is actually too much of depression, but if you want it, this story can serve you well. And Mrs Weasley is just pure gold in this story!

*** Excellent story. But be warned : there are at least three attempted suicides in this fic and two actual suicides. All by major characters.

**** Yes, true, I should mention that. But if the original poster wanted a depression, it goes with that I am afraid.

#+begin_quote
  Rather than allowing Harry to stay at Diagon Alley after he blew up Aunt Marge, the Ministry sends Harry back to the Dursleys. Harry returns to school after a terrible summer, to find that he's not the only one with this kind of secret. A student has been killed by his family. New screening measures are put into place by the Ministry: Every student must be given a medical exam and interview to look for child abuse. With Dumbledore facing an inquiry, Snape is entrusted with the task of making sure EVERYONE receives one. Answer to the "New measures for screening abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. The first chapter contains a character death and the whole story is quite dark. It begins at the beginning of Prisoner of Azkaban and is AU thereafter. Also note: this story is a "Snape is Harry's biological dad" story. This is not supposed to be the central theme of the story, but people have gotten annoyed that I didn't tell them at the beginning. Another note: There are no pairings in this story, or explicit sexual content. There are, however, mentions of homosexuality. Since there are no pairings, there is no slash content, but if the mere mention of homosexuality offends you, read something else.
