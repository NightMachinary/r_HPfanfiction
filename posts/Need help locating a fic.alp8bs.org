I read a slow burn HG/SS fic a long time ago that I want to reaquire. The main premise was that Hermione's parents were really the royals of the wizarding world, who's parents had put them into hiding during the first Volde-war. Snape was a lord, but since the royals were in hiding, peerages were pretty much being ignored. In the end Hermione and Severus got together right after graduation. HELP!!!
