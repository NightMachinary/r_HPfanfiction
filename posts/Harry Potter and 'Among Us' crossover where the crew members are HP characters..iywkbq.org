If someone doesn't know, Among Us is a videogame where a crew of astronauts has to fix a broken-down spaceship and among them, there are aliens disguised as humans who have to sabotage the mission and kill the crew. The humans can win with either fixing the spaceship or finding out who are the impostors and eliminating them. Something really similar to the movie 'The Thing'.

I'm thinking of writing a story that is the same as Among Us, but with HP characters but I have way too many WIPs (both fics and fan arts) to start one more that I'll most likely never finish anytime soon.


** Harry pointed angrily across the table. "Malfoy is definitely involved, somehow!"

Hermione sighed. "This again, Harry?"

Draco looked amused. "Honestly, Potter, you've been acting pretty sus."

*** Ginny jumped up and smashed her fist on the table. "I've had it! I'm just going to beat both of you unconscious and decide who is the impostor based on the fact that which one of you will bite down my arm in the process unless you start cooperating!"

"That's what the imposter would say," Stated Luna, starting a full brawl in the cafeteria.

**** Draco catches his breath in the copilot's seat, as Pansy works on a task at the pilot's control panel.

"How could they think I'm suspicious?" He asked, between gasps. "I helped them shove Greg through the fucking airlock! Would I have done that if I knew he wasn't the impostor?"

"No," Pansy replied, not looking up.

"It's a good thing this door closed on us," Draco continued, gesturing at the heavy steel door behind them. "Potter may have caught us otherwise."

"Yeah, lucky that," Pansy agreed, distractedly.

Draco sighed. "At least I can trust one person up here."

Any reply Pansy had was interrupted by a beeping noise, and a metallic click in the far corner of the cockpit, near an air vent. "Aha, got it."

Draco looked at the panel she had been working on. "What are you doing?" He asked.

She swiveled in her chair, facing him. He did not notice the wand in her hand.

"I was just wondering if the killing curse works through these space suits."

***** Ron and Harry stood in the doorway, looking at Draco's dead body.

"The guilt must have gotten to him," said Harry, after a moment.

Ron eyed his friend, and wondered if the oxygen was low or something. Draco hadn't killed himself. No, Pansy had jumped the gun and moved too soon. Now the whole plan was out the airlock.

Ron just hoped he didn't end up the same way.

"Good thing I trusted you, mate," Ron said, clapping Harry on the back.

****** "Hssss hssssssss hssss hssssssss," Harry commanded the snake drone.

"Program activated! Patrolling the area around the medbay!" The drone's artificial voice was heard from its speaker.

As the robotic snake vanished in the darkness of the corridor leading to the cafeteria, Ron kept staring at him as if he knew something.

"Why are you looking at me like that?" said the heir of Slytherin.

The other one is Dumbledore, of course.

****** "I fear no man!" Voldemort stated, "But that.... thing," he nodded at the direction of a humanoid shape that was wearing a bright pink spacesuit and a pointy hat, "it scares me."
