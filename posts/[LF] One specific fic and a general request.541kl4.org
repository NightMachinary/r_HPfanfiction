Hi there. I'm in a bit of a nostalgia drive and I'm trying to find a fic that I read probably about 9 years ago. Any chance anyone might remember this: It was a fic where Dumbledore was evil and shagging Hermione who was just as evil. Main pairing was Harry/Severus, Harry/Lucius, I think with Harry/Severus/Lucius. Voldemort was good. I'm also pretty sure there was a major character death in there. I know it's not much to go on but any help would be very much appreciated.

I'm also looking for anything well written and saturated with imagery, heaps of metaphors and so on. Something like Howl for anyone also in the Supernatural fandom. I'm just looking for something beautiful to read. Anything goes except mpreg and harry/hermione.

Thank you for your help!

That's pretty good, though I think I prefer Hermidore.

***** A hermidore sounds like some sort of lumbering mammal that consumes books and sour candy.

*** Holy shit. I've read fics where them having sex is mentioned as a joke, but never thought somebody would actually write that...I want to read that fic, though, if Voldemort is good.

This one sounds similar. Hermione and Dumbledore are shagging each other and there are sex scenes between the two of them that made me want to gouge my eyeballs out, but that I kept reading out of some morbid fascination. It's HPSS only, though, no HPSSLM. At least, as far as I know of. I didn't finish the fic, because honestly, I just read it to see what the HGAD scenes were like.

  Harry descovers that Hermione is spying on him for Dumbledore. What will happen? will Harry create his own side in this war? To do that he has to become powerful, emancipated and untouchable by Dumbledore HP/SS Mpreg Ron becomes Harry's blood brother. Hermione/Dumbledore scenes be warned!

**** I read around half of it last night. Almost stopped at the mpreg part, but then stopped after one of the Hermione/Dumbledore sex scenes.
