Hey guys! I just recently finished DAYD and I was wondering if anyone knows if the other two books in the series are available in audiobook format. I found somewhere that apparently the person who did the first one was working on Sluagh but I haven't been able to find it anywhere. Any help or knowledge on this is greatly appreciated! Thanks!


** You might like to expand on that acronym.
