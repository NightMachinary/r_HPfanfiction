Sure, it's a common trope. But I'd like to read the best of the best stories where a tiny change throws the normal story into a /completely/ new direction.

Some Guidelines:

1. If you don't know what I mean by "For Want of a Nail", [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail][read a bit about it]] before recommending something. If you know the poem its from, you get the idea.
2. I'd prefer a focus on the story over romance. So, most likely gen is preferred, but I'm not too picky so any pairings are fine too.
3. Length doesn't matter too much. One shots, short stories, novels -- all are great. But if you recommend a series or story with a million+ words, take some time to explain why its worth the investment :)
4. The more changes, the better! The "nail" shouldn't be easily resolved back into something like the "Stations of Canon".

I can't wait to read some new stories!

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725][Forging the Sword]] - "For a want of a nail" type fic that diverges from the end of CoS. Great take on the magic system, that's creative and stays close to canon at the same time. Rather slow paced, with the whole third year being focused mostly on the character- and worldbuilding. Sadly died just when plot was started getting really interesting. Though considering author's earlier hiatuses I still have hope for more updates. In this case the change is in mechanics of the diary - killing Tom would also kill Ginny. But not killing Tom would also mean that Ginny will die. And so Harry is forced to do a hard thing and kill his friend's sister. And things spiral out of there.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11815956][The Leapling (prologue to the series)]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8202739][Weasley Girl]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9932798][Weasley Girl: Secrets of the Past]] - "For a want of a nail" type fic with Ron's gender (we have Ronnie here) being the point of divergence. Stays very close to canon in terms of characters, settings and initial plot, but manages to spin in interesting and original direction. Ongoing, rare updates.

*** I loved Forging the Sword! It was the first incomplete story I read, when I was a newbie in hpfanfiction and just branching out to 'stories that may never finish'. I should reread it, thanks for reminding me!

I've seen Weasley Girl rec'd a few times, but I was always under the impression it stuck to the Stations of Canon pretty closely, and 'Ronnie' didn't cause many significant changes. Obviously I was wrong, but does it take a while to diverge, or does it happen pretty quickly?

Well, the most immediate difference is that Ronnie, being a girl, makes friends with Hermione much more quickly than in canon, and Neville is brought into the group as well.

While "Harry having a Marauders-esque crew" fics are a Knut a dozen, there's are several significant consequences for the four of them becoming friends so early, especially for their interactions with Snape.

Ronnie herself is also very different than Ron. While their personalities are similar, the dynamics of a two-daughter Weasley family are notably different.

Percy, Fred and George are much more protective of Ronnie than they were of Ron--Fred notably did not turn Ronnie's teddy bear into a spider.

Ronnie also took Ginny under her wing from the start, which strengthens her leadership skills.

Divergence comes up big in Secrets of the Past, but I will not elaborate, since the consequences are huge.

****** You're welcome!

There's a bunch of other smaller differences.

Some difference don't mean much, or at least not yet.

For example, while Fred and George didn't bully Ronnie as much as they did Ron, it's strongly implied that Ronnie was frequently a victim of tickle torture.

This hasn't really become much of a plot point, but it does mean that Ronnie sucks at espionage--even Hedwig nibbling her ear is enough to make her laugh.

Another example is that Ronnie and Ginny share a room. Think about what happens to Ginny in canon, and think what would happen if someone were over her shoulder at the time.

There's a bunch more, but the story itself is well worth the read.

Things escalate pretty quickly. It generally stuck to the basic premises of the first two years (Voldemort is after the Philosopher's Stone and Heir of Slytherin attacks) but the ways in which the situations developed and resolved were completely different.
