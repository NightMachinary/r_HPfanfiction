Does anyone know any fics where the main character (or a well featured character) is gender fluid? Could be Harry or someone else/OC.\\
I'm interested in fics that use magic to solve issues around gender dysphoria or perhaps the character is a metamorphmagus.\\
Well written only please I'm not looking for potion accident gender changes etc.\\
Thanks!

** I always loved going into the arena with your head held high by lullabyknell! Linkao3(into the arena with your head held high by lullabyknell)

Teddy sometimes goes by Hope on different days or moments and it actually saves them at one point. It's honestly beautifully done.

Great story of HP and Teddy post apocalyptic world.

** This kind of fic request doesn't usually work here. You could try [[https://eldritcher-hp-fics.dreamwidth.org/20283.html][Omphale]] which is Harry centric and more around fluidity or [[https://eldritcher-hp-fics.dreamwidth.org/19343.html][Epic of the forgotten]] which is Viktor Krum centric and more around dysphoria. Both are well written and really strong fics. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/997569][Standing on the shoreline]] is a bit of both and Snape centric.

** Sirius Black presents Remus to Tonks. She is very embarrased because... she already met him... when she/he was a man.

Featuring an organic Andromeda, speaking about gender fluidness, and a reasonable explanation of the Nymphadora name.

  Molly tried her best. When Harry had told them, Arthur had asked excitedly, "is this a Muggle thing?" Hermione had hurried out a "no!" and a frantic history of gender diversity in the wizarding world. "It's just that I'm a girl," Harry had said, and Arthur had nodded and asked her about how telephone booths worked. He would call her by the right pronouns until the day he died at the respectable old age of one hundred and thirty three, and he would make it seem easy. But Molly had to try. Hermione explained things faster and higher-pitched every time Molly messed up a pronoun. Molly frowned and muttered and put extra potatoes on Harry's plate at breakfast. Harry slept in Ron's room, which didn't bother either of them but which made Hermione scowl. Harry got boxes of sweets and warm hugs, as Molly chewed things over. For her fifteenth Christmas, the Weasley sweater she would receive would be a bright, friendly, terrible pink. The next time Harry visited, Molly put her on Ginny's floor to sleep-- for some definition of sleep that involved Hermione hissing threats at three in the morning if Harry and Ginny didn't "shut up about Wronski feints, do you know what time it is."

  In which a person has read the books, has seen the movies, has scoured the Wikia and Pottermore, and consumed and written sooo much fanfiction, but imagining what it would be like in a story is so much different than how they themselves would make of things. Thank god they're already a pro at living mostly in their head. They supposed they would have to do their best. Or not --- they could just kill themselves. . . . Hmm, but that wouldn't really be childrens'-book friendly. They suspected quite a bit of their take on this wouldn't be.

  "Stop moving, Potter," Malfoy mumbled from where his head was buried under a pillow. "You're disturbing my hangover. Also, why are you still here?""This is my hotel room," Harry told him.

  Harry spends the whole summer before fourth year feeling restless. He chalks it up to the weird dreams he's been having, assuming Voldemort is responsible. And for some dreams, that's true - but what about the other ones? The ones that feel... familiar?Back at school, things change one morning in September, when he and three other students wake up with the memories of the four Hogwarts founders in their heads. They don't know why they've returned, or how it happened, but they know one thing - they changed the Wizarding World before, and they're going to do it again. It's about time they shook things up a bit.Tagged underage for Harry/Cedric (14/17)
