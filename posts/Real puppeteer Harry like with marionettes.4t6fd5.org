I know it sounds convoluted, but hear me out. I've read a few good stories where Naruto is a puppeteer. I was curious if there is a story where Harry does something similar. That or just a simple fascination with puppets. I think it out like a life with the dursleys left him a little odd. Puppets either being his friends or just things he like to spend time learning how to do.


** There's a series on AO3 by mad_martha in which Harry is a natural Animator and uses his gift to make puppets. Fair warning, it's Slytherin!Harry, Harry/Ron slash (with a bit of background Sirius/Remus slash as well) and very AU. Puppet building starts in Book 4.
