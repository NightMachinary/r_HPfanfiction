  On the first day of the Festival of the Crumple Horned Snorkack, the Ravenclaws came to Luna and asked, “Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Halloween Feast?” She replied, “Go into the city to a certain man and tell him, ‘Luna Lovegood says: My appointed time is near. I am going to celebrate Halloween with the classmates of our house.' ” So the Ravenclaws did as Luna had directed them and prepared the Halloween Feast. When evening came, Luna was reclining at the table with the Twelve most promising Ravenclaws. And while they were eating, she said, “Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me.” They were very sad and began to say to her one after the other, “Surely you don't mean me, Luna?” She replied, “The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me. The Daughter of The Quibbler will go just as it is written about her. But woe to that man who betrays the Daughter of The Quibbler! It would be better for him if he had not been born.” Then Terry, the one who would betray her, said, “Surely you don't mean me, Luna?” Luna answered, “You have said so.” While they were eating, Luna took bread, and when she had given thanks, she broke it and gave it to her classmates, saying, “Take and eat; this is the Nargle.” Then she took a cup, and when she had given thanks, she gave it to them, saying, “Drink from it, all of you. This is the Blibbering Humbdinger of the Forbidden Forest, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. I tell you, I will not drink from this Butterbeer from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's Quibbler reading group.” When they had sung the Hogwart's Song, they went out to the Forbidden Forrest.

** A low murmur was heard at breakfast from the Ravenclaw table. As one, all the Ravenclaws stood up and in one sweeping move, removed their outer robes. The inner robes had Sirius Black's wanted poster printed across the front. Luna nodded at Roger Davies as he cast a Sonorus spell on himself - "Free Stubby Boardman!", he screamed. The Ravenclaws brought up Hobgoblin banners as "Remember the name" blared from a loud Wizarding Wireless machine.

Dumbledore looked positively giddy as other teachers and students stared dazedly at the Ravenclaws. Ron calmly picked up a slice of toast and started buttering it shaking his head and muttering about 'Dark Lady Luna'.
