It's kind of hard to explain, but I think it's because she's so innocent and childlike, that the idea of her involved in anything especially sexual just feels off. And it's a shame that I feel this way, seeing as I ship Harry/Luna pretty hard, yet smut with her just doesn't feel right.

Anyone get where I'm coming from?


** Fanon!Luna has two interpretations: what you described, and the other portrays her as being super obsessed with sex.

** Shall I reuse a statement I made elsewhere? I shall.

Luna can't be done right as a pairing. She can be done very wrong, but for a romantic lead during the time of the novels, she sucks. Why? Because when she's written in-character, sex with Luna seems more like pedophilia than with any other character. Harry screwing with Gabrielle Delacour seems more legitimate.

The girl is painfully shy and socially underdeveloped. She may be insightful, but always seems to exhibit a level of detachment usually associated with Autism (of the Asperger's syndrome variety) or sociopathy. If Harry gets hard for that, he's got more issues than I'd originally assumed.

In the fandom, there seem to be a few key 'variant' Lunas to work around this:

- Var. A: Shag-ready hippie. Popularized in 'Lovegood, Boobs Gooder', 'Larceny,Lechery and Luna Lovegood', 'Sword of Gryffindor' and many others, this is the sexual free spirit that guarantees a rating bump. If Luna's involved, there will be shagging. Not making love, mind you- it will be sport-sex. It has its purpose, but this isn't Luna by a far stretch.

- Var. B: Oracle-Sue. Found in any number of H/Hr/Luna arrangements, most Super!Harry epics (think Sunset/Sunrise over Britain) and the occasional Hermione-bashfest. This version has a thumb on Fate's pulse and arranges for Harry's particular brand of heroic blunder to somehow land on all the bonus squares.

- Var. C: 'Hiding beneath the weird' version of Hermione. This was JBern's take for his Second-person Cursebreaker!Harry duo, though I've seen it used before and since. It demotes Luna to a second-rate Daphne or Pansy. "I'm only faking it because I'm so damned smart. Let me show you how to own the Ministry."

- Var. D: Hermione's femme-slash foil. A variant you won't find unless you look for lesbian erotica, it plays up the contrast between the two as a much more soft-light 'discovering herself' story, usually post-victory. Always, Luna is the initiator and Hermione becomes her adept.

- Var. E: Yandere!Luna. This is really variant 'A' with a psycho killer backup plan. Found in a few DarkHarry fics (as well as the Spiral Path, but there isn't a good idea I haven't mishandled in that story).

- Var. F: Canon + 3oz of courage. A few have tasted this rarefied concoction. I think I came close with 'Retroactive', and the gold standard is 'Contemplating Clouds'. Luna is mostly Luna, but not so damaged- she's confident enough to open Harry's heart and her own. I don't think this works within the context of Harry's fight with Voldemort. She's suited for healing him after, but would distract him from focusing on his unfortunate reality even more than Ron does already.

  “He says funny things sometimes, doesn't he?” said Luna as they set off down the corridor together. “But he can be a bit unkind. I noticed that last year.”

  “I s'pose,” said Harry. Luna was demonstrating her usual knack of speaking uncomfortable truths; he had never met anyone quite like her. “So have you had a good term?”

****** As a high-functioning autistic, I'd have to agree with your evaluation. Luna is potentially on the spectrum in my eyes. But then you immediately follow that with "Luna reads like a child to me", and that... let's just say that hits some personal buttons for me.

Luna has never felt childlike to me. Spacy, disconnected, imaginative, but not simple-minded or overly innocent. I can easily see her in a sexual relationship. Why? Because I am spacy, disconnected and imaginative as well, but I'm not some sheltered little virgin who's innocence must be protected.

Sorry. Again, personal. TL;DR, being autistic or autistic-like does not preclude one from having sex.

******* I've always pegged Luna as having Schizotypal Personality Disorder than anything on the autism spectrum; she has no trouble reading and interpreting the facial expressions of others, for example (in DH she recognises a polyjuiced Harry from his facial expressions when no one else does).

[[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypal_personality_disorder]]

"People with this disorder feel extreme discomfort with maintaining close relationships with people, mainly for the fact that they think that their peers harbor negative thoughts towards them, so they avoid forming them. Peculiar speech mannerisms and odd modes of dress are also diagnostic signs of this disorder. In some cases, people with STPD may react oddly in conversations, not respond, or talk to themselves. They frequently misinterpret situations as being strange or having unusual meaning for them; paranormal and superstitious beliefs are common."

** I loved this quote about Luna from linkffn(Twelve Dark Moons):

#+begin_quote
  She was the only young member of the Order to qualify for unicorn hair-gathering; the unicorn responded best to the maiden.

  There was Neville Longbottom, of course. He was a boy, but Luna was also certain he was a maiden one. Neville's gentle nature was endearing and his inner resolve unshakeable, but he had yet to find romance with any but his adored Mimbulus Mimbletonia plant. Luna would be willing to kiss him, out of curiosity, but she had trouble mustering the healthy lust of a twenty-year-old, not just toward Neville but toward anyone. Her realm was the clouds, the mind, dreams and thoughts and wind. Earthy passion was not Luna's style.

** Perhaps I'm biased, but I don't think we should be jumping to conclusions about her mental capacity. Besides, people with high-functioning autism and Asperger's can consent too. Her innocence seems to be more of a coping mechanism than actually thinking that people will not do any harm to her.

Furthermore, though when we meet her she says that her shoes went missing instead of acknowledging that her housemates stole them, at the end of the series she has seen war, the Carrows, her father being captured, imprisonment etc. I'd say she isn't as innocent anymore and certainly has friends.

Due to her frankness I can actually see her saying things like 'you have a very nice bottom, you know' matter-of-factly and making people uncomfortable... she would probably be open with her thoughts and desires.

I do get where you're coming from though. I'd /nope/ at anything below fourth year Luna because it's strongly implied that she has no friends before then, and would be vulnerable (she said that DA is almost like having friends) - and anyway, she'd be 14.

** She only appeared child-like. I always sense an incredibly tough girl underneath that mask.

Once she was brought into Harry's circle, she participated in almost every major engagements. Leading the DA in year 7 was no minor feat, and surviving the final battle without injuries was a huge accomplishment. It was also her who drove away scores of dementors and saved the trio's lives. The fact that she could still conjure up such strong happy memories when the trio could not, should indicate how tough she really was.

** Only if it is abusive smut. Even if she has aspergers/autism or is severly traumatized or just odd i dont see having sex in a healthy relationship as something negative, so i dont see a problem with it.

My inner view of the characters if very minted by the movies sadly, and i just dont find the actress very attractive, so im not that big a fan of her in smut or erotica anyways (which is the same reason i dont like sirius, lupin or snape focused fics).

** Well, I get where your coming from and I think it comes from this. Luna is eclectic and in some ways possibily has a mental illness, whilst awesome and such it seems like it would be very easy to manipulate her because of the way she is, and that would be wrong. I see it as sex with someone who has limited capacity to make decisions, it's really wrong, and I think that group includes Luna.
