Who cares about pairings, tags whatever. Talk about your favourite fics, ones that hit you hard, changed your life or one's you just want to recommend to people or aren't as popular as they deserve to be.


** FloreatCastellum's novels get recommended a lot (and they should).

But her oneshots on AO3 and her Tumblr don't get as many shout-outs and are lovely. She writes a wonderful Harry through so many different parts of his life. She does such a great job weaving the sadness of his childhood with the trauma of his school years with his adult years as part of a big, loving, - but a little broken - family. You totally get the strength of the his "power the dark lord knows not". So many authors struggle with balancing his resilience and strength with vulnerability. She does it so well. She gives him a very believable happily ever after without ignoring what he's been through.

*** Thank you for reccing this writer, and linking her tumblr vignettes as well as her works on AO3! I read several of the ficlets and I enjoyed them. You're correct that the Harry she writes is completely IC, which I think is difficult to achieve. I am looking forward to going down the floreatcastellum rabbit hole later this evening!! I love the fact that Harry's early childhood is explored; it's not easy to write very young children properly, is it? I can't wait to delve into this fanfic with a cup of hot cocoa, in my reading nest!

**** Absolutely agree, she is a great writer! If you like the Hinny pairing, gryffindormischief has some great one shots and multi chaps. For me, fave stories would be frombluetored's It's TeaTime series, recc'd often on the Hinny discord group. And Annerb's brilliant Changeling and Armistice series. Shout out to jenorama and thedistantdusk for their stories too. So many more but these are my go to stories I read over and over

Totally unsurprised this is the top comment. She's such a fantastic writer. I've been in such fanfic slump after reading all her stuff, because nothing else can quite compare.

** [[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18LfF7F3kBx7FpHUIa_FMGTDvnChrEaN9][Faith and Understanding]] by Lethe Laguz

This is my all-time favorite Harry Potter fanfic, and my favorite one-shot period.

It tells the story of Ginny Weasely's friendship with Luna Lovegood, and Ginny's musings therein.

It's funny, it's heartfelt, it's goofy, it's sweet. Ginny and Luna argue and tease and confide in one another.

And it has my favorite passage from any Harry Potter fanfic ever:

#+begin_quote
  Ginny often got her guessing games wrong. Who could really predict someone like Luna? She seemed above earthly things as much as she seemed to understand them better than anyone.

  It didn't matter, though. When Harry asked Luna to Slughorn's party, Luna's smiles were brighter than ever as she bounced around wondering whether she should wear her butter beer cork necklace while Ginny assured her that there wouldn't be any Nargles at the party. Ginny couldn't have been happier for Luna, and so it was all right if she didn't understand the Quibbler's latest theory about the Rotfang Conspiracy.

  As they laid in the grass one day in a rare moment of luxurious laziness, Ginny decided to play one last guessing game. Just one last question. And a rather personal one, at that.

  "Luna, who's your favorite person?"

  She felt the grass tickling her bare feet as the obvious answer entered her mind almost immediately. Luna's father, her most talked about person, the person she believed without question, no matter what he said. They surely had a wonderful family relationship.

  But Luna smiled her brightest smile and twitched her nose in that rabbit-like way of hers.

  "You are."

  Ginny leaned her head back and smiled. She was shocked once again, but that was fine. She didn't think she would ever understand Luna completely--nobody would. The girl was an enigma, bright and mysterious as the moon. But that was okay.

  Because Luna was Ginny's favorite person too.

** Changeling by Annerb is popular but it's fantastic so I'm going to recommend it anyway!

Not as popular as it should be: this calls for a toast so pour the champagne by tinyporcelainehorses. Funny, touching, amazing character growth arc for such a short fic.

While there, he meets Harry's friends, discovers some fascinating wizarding adult beverages - and meets Cho Chang, who has her own reasons to find herself out of place and drinking heavily at the wedding of Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley.In the months to come, this unlikely encounter will make him rethink his attitudes towards the magical world, drastically change the course of both of their lives, and change Dudley's relationship with his family forever.

** linkffn(13266686) - Not Dumbledore

Generally, I stay away from both one-shots and post-Voldemort fics. I like longer fics, 150k+ kinda long, but this is one of the best I've read. The characterization, the war-veteran Harry and Ron's maturity... Absolutely fantastic.

linkffn(12511998) - Wind Shear

The best time-travel to Marauder's Era, jaded, powerful Harry fic I've read. The banter, duels, serious conversations are very well done. And it's the only one I know which 'redeems' Bellatrix while keeping her in character. She keeps her insanity and love for fight, and takes time to get out of her disdain for muggles.

linkffn(13108396) - For Lack of a Bezoar

One of the best Dark-but-not-evil Harry stories. Hits right where it hurts. If you read nothing else from this list, read this. It packs a whole lot of feels in less than 40k words. Gold.

** I will never stop recommending linkffn(ignite by slide). I actually prefer next-gen because I can't deal with much OOC (depsite all of JKRs flaws). The second book of the trilogy literally made me weak--I don't remember the last time I had such a visceral reaction to a book, fanfic or otherwise. Beautifully fleshed out, imperfect characters, a detailed plot, and humor to boot.

AND...there's a quarantine! how festive!

  People rally to a just man, as Umbridge finds when the DA follows Harry to arrest her and demand that the Wizengamot try her for torture. When Dumbledore seeks atonement in battle against Voldemort Harry inherits his power and his responsibilities.

  What if Voldemort had chosen the pureblood boy, not the halfblood, as his opponent? This Neville would have had graves to visit, instead of a hospital. He'd still have grown up in his grandmother's clutches, tut-tutted at, dropped out windows absentmindedly, left to bounce on paving stones.Let's tell this story: Alice Longbottom, who was the better at hexing, told Frank to take Neville and run.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10672917/chapters/23626929?view_adult=true][Debt of Time]] is one of the best fanfiction ever written and I stand by my words. I understand that the pairings and the lenght are big reasons why people don't read it, but let me tell you something, once i started reading it i just couldnt stop. it's crazy how insanely well written and captivating it is, i must have cried at least 4 times (that's a difficult thing to achieve tbh), it hurt in the best "worst" way possible. Also the fact that i read this fic in a moment of my life that was so so bad, that it was a much needed scape, then i read it one more time in chronological order and it still hit just as hard. I will always have a special place in my heart for this story. And in my opinion it's the one story everyone should read.

There's also [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12614436/1/Hermione-Granger-Demonologist][Hermione Granger, Demonologist]] it's a story i had so much fun reading, really can't recommend it enough... Simply one of the best Hermione centric fics out there.

The author did an amazing job working JKR's version of time travel. There's a bunch of moments that we get frustrated that she doesnt change things too, but the basic law is that if she changes something in the past, the future as she knows will change too and she doesn't want that because that could end badly.

Its my favourite Harry Potter Fanfic, and I've been reading them for almost 2 decades.

Harry Potter is raised by the Addams family, and its dark, funny, clever, and extremely well written.

I love how they write Snape, Harry and Wednesday are creepy and amazing, and the whole thing is really well done.

*** I am all into this premise. Thanks!

Ok. Finished what's done. Looks like the author is actively working on it, as there's updates from only a short time back. Author also goes through and makes edits to previously uploaded stuff, which I respect. If a later time you think something could be better worded, by all means do so.

- has a minor trope-y thing, but it's minor. Hopefully you can look past that annoyance, because it's well researched and written overall.

- author did a lot of background work, and mentions their source material, or their thinking behind why something was written as it was.

- author does sometimes borrow text from the books, but it's so seamless that you hardly notice it, and you can see why they did so.

- interesting use of the time travel thing. Not at all how I expected originally. I generally dislike time travel stories in general, but this one isn't your typical use of the trope, so I'm not mad at it.

- author is pretty even handed with the characters; not all of X is going to be good or bad. People are complex and have multiple parts of their selves. This, I believe, is their strongest part.

- my one gripe is that there is a /lot/ of internal monologue. I'm not exaggerating here. Sometimes it carries on for ages. For me, who prefers a dialogue driven story, it was irritating enough that I found myself skipping a lot of it. Generally, the reason I love a good editor is that they'll call these issues out, and push you to get that 3 paragraph musing down to a few words that do the same job.

Honestly, I can generally infer what the character is thinking by their actions. I don't like long rumination in someone's brain. If you like that sort of thing though, you should be fine.

** The Best Revenge, On the Way to Greatness and The Accidental Animagus are some of my favourites.

The Best Revenge does mentor Snape so well. He's still sarcastic, but he learns to look past Harry being James' son and see him as his own person. I also love how Harry has many friend circles.

On the Way to Greatness has spoiled me for Slytherin Harry. I dislike fics that'll have him magically become Draco's BFF or have Snape suddenly like him just because he's in Slytherin. I think the relationships and characterization are very believable.

The Accidental Animagus has Harry use his Animagus ability in various scenarios in a way that actually drives forward the story. There are some very clever ideas that make certain plot elements possible and I like the OCs and magical systems that White Squirrel invents.

I also enjoy Petrification Proliferation by the same writer. For Want of a Nail fics have always intrigued me and this one does the whole idea of adults being actually responsible and dutiful (I know, shocking right?) in the HP world so well.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][Harry Potter and The Prince of Slytherin]] (976k. in progress). Beautifully written with Slytherin!Harry and his twin brother. Read it. I think that this is my all time fav HP fic.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10588629?view_full_work=true][Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions]] (184k. Complete). Harry is good at potions. Loads of mentor!snape. There are some really funny bits, not very angst-y. It's not as popular as it deserves to be so pls go read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10487644/1/Courage-and-Cunning][Courage and Cunning]] (523k. Abandoned?). Where Harry Potter is actually Salazar Slytherin (he's not evil!) and Salazar is protecting the Potters cuz Dumbledore is an idiot. Go read it!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13225966/1/Defence-Professor-Wohl][Defense Professor Wohl]] (54k. Complete). Grindelwald becomes a professor. The late-middle bit is a little sad.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish][Make a Wish]] (187k. Complete). Super cool fic. With bamf!Harry and oblivious!Harry. He travels the world under the name Mr. Black and accidentally becomes the most dangerous man on the planet. He eventually lives up to it! It's really funny so go read.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22405891?view_full_work=true][The immortal and the revenant]] (Merlin crossover. 149k. Will be complete in 2 days). Awesome fic. Merlin (from the TV show) helps the Order of the Phoenix. It's probably better if you've watched Merlin b4 reading this. It's a cool TV show. I had a crush on Morgana. Merlin and Arthur were super gay but Arthur got with Gwen so that was annoying. But Gwen is great so it's okay-ish. But the show is great, go watch it.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/473335?view_full_work=true][Twist of Fate]] (Drarry. 302k. Complete). One of the best Draco/Harry fics I have ever read. It's beautifully written and has amazing characterization. They have a completely secret relationship- except for Cedric, he knows(then he dies)- and then later in the book Draco has to obliviate Harry and after that point I spent so much time crying. Anyway, read this pls.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12006417?view_full_work=true][Survival is a talent]] (Drarry. 338k+. In progress) Super cute soulmate fic. Harry and Draco find out they're soulmates and become friends. They eventually tell their respective friends and they all become a big secret-ish friend group. Go read it.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10057010?view_full_work=true][All the young dudes]] (527k. Complete) Marauder-era. About the marauders as they go through Hogwarts. It fits canon really well. It's an amazing fic!! I read it for the first time as it was being posted and I'm reading it again and I still love it! :)

That's all I can think of at the moment. Go read all these fics! And maybe watch Merlin as well.

** I'll probably get some downvotes/whaargarbl for this, but it's still one of my all-time favorites: linkffn(Harry Crow)

On the minus side, it does rely a bit on Dumbledore-bashing and maybe a tiny bit of Ron-bashing (though Ron is mostly a non-entity in the fic), has an oh-so-awesome Harry, and basically has Harry and Hermione start falling in love at eleven.

On the plus side, it does an amazing job of making the characters feel like people rather than the ambulatory plot devices JKR wrote, giving more depth and growth to more characters in one novel-length fic than Rowling managed in seven novels. Characters act in a way that fits for them instead of whatever happens to be needed to drive the desired plot. Both the heroes and the villains get a substantial competence upgrade, with Voldemort feeling more threatening despite ending up in a much worse situation than canon. Victories feel earned rather than contrived, coming about thanks to training, preparation, and smart decisions rather than obscure wandlore and other deus-ex-machina or to being marginally less incompetent than the bad guys. It also drove emotional investment really well, to the point where it actually managed to get my heart pounding on a couple of occasions due to the tension - not a lot of written works manage that.

** So I recently listened to the Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. Eneasz Brodski brought the work to life in a way that most audiobooks fail to do, mainly with having the characters voiced by various people.

Now the story itself has a lot of the regular tropes but done exceedingly well. Harry is smart and powerful. Except he's annoying as fuck during parts and does stupid things because as smart and powerful as he is, he is still 11.

Manipulative dumbledore, complex asshole snape, competent Voldemort.

While there are many pitfalls in the story and not much payoff until the end I don't think I can read another story about manipulative dumbledore or powerful Harry as I don't think they will compare.

** The Arithmancer and it's sequels is my favourite, by far. I like that it doesn't do the fanfiction weirdness that permeates this community, and that it just reads as a story instead of either a powerwank, a mugglewank, a contrived "romance", or anything of the sort. It's just a story that tells a story and doesn't drag on and on and on with meaningless garbage nobody wants to read, or create insanely uncomfortable situations to read.

** Oh I get to gush about my favs! I love, love, love Against the moon. When I read it, it feels like I'm in the story with the characters.Another thing is that the author definitely knows what she's writing about. There are a few very powerful passages I found relatable.Stoplightdelight does know how a person in Remus's position might feel. She also has included some erm traditionally feminine women. Her Charlotte White is my absolute favourite. I even stopped reading the Silkworm because that fanfic was far more interesting than Rowlling's novel lol. I don't need Rowling to write a prequel, I only want stoplight to finish her fic. I also love Fernwithy's shifts and Shades. I've read quite a few stories about Remus's mission with the werewolves, and none of them was as interesting as Shades. I simply didn't care what happened to Remus or anyone else in those fics. But fern's characters really made me care about them. I was hoping them to succeed and was angry when a bad guy targeted them. And no one else showed Remus's teaching talent better than Fern. I even liked tonks in that story which has never happened before. It was a romance based on friendship, not just superficial attraction. I also loved Darsynia's Remus Hermione story the longest distance. I loved it because for the first time in the history of fics I read, someone told that Remus needs to have someone in his corner. That was no focus on showing a mistreated lady who is desperately in love. And Remus and Herione sort have their roles reversed, with Remus being the one who provides support. I have never seen this done but have always wanted to read something like that.

** So many! Here are some of my faves! They're all Severus-centric since that's my jam.

A Year Like None Other stands out. Especially if you like a good Severus-as-father-figure fic.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/742072/chapters/1382061]]

Resonance is another brilliant mentor!Snape.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1795399/1/Resonance]]

And I'm a sucker for healer!Snape so Reading the Signs is a great one too!

** Okey so this one fic I read has Harry being reborn as Reghar Targaryen's younger brother. Here Harry and him are goals+ BROTP™ ✔️ and the fic is hilarious. Also Sirius Black is reborn as a younger stark brother.

Harry, now known as Jaherys along with Sirius and Tyrion form the best and most awesome squad.

Harry : (not in this order) Fixes the magic that went wrong in Old Valeria. Campaigns to abolish slavery. Creates a new kingdom that's a sister house. BRINGS BACK THE DRAGONS AND RIDES BELERION. 10/10

((The author kind of wrote themselves into a tiny corner because of the paring (Harry and Kal drogo) because that's meh. ))BUT the fic was awesome and hilarious in every other way especially the BROTP b/w Harry and his brother.

I've forgotten the fics name if anyone remembers please post it below.

** My favourite is 'Hold my hand' by /the_drarry_life/ on Wattpad. Its about a potions experiment that causes Harry and Draco to be connected by the hands for 10 weeks unless they consunmate the bond. Its amazing, I've read it at least 6 times and you can't even be bored reading it because the commentators are FRICKING hilarious.

** [[http://www.hpmor.com][Methods of Rationality]] is a classic. There are flaws, but people who dislike the story for whatever reason often blow them out of proportion and act like they make it an unreadable mess. In reality, there are a few parts that might make you cringe, a lot more that are pretty hilarious, and some crowning moments of awesome.

Now, I also want to talk about [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/The_Carnivorous_Muffin/profile][The Carnivorous Muffin]] who makes works of absurdist art. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675621][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] is where it all starts, and it is well worth the read. Muffin's works generally feature a female Harry who isn't just the Master of Death, but is Death itself masquerading in a mortal shell. I highly recommend this as well as Muffin's crossover fics with Pokémon (which has a surprisingly insightful view of the role Pokémon play), Star Wars, (with an enemy on Death's level), Lord of the Rings (exploring the character growth of both Lily and the One Ring), and Naruto (beware the clones).
