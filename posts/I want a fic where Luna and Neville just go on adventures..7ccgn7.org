Look, we already know that Neville can be the biggest badass in the world if he's got an excuse and a chance. He cut off the head of a giant horcrux-snake with the sword of Gryffindor, for pete's sake!

But he's not the chosen one, so nobody cares about him. In canon he marries Hannah Abbot and basically just gets forgotten about.

But what about this? It's after the Battle of Hogwarts, and Neville's just sitting there on the castle steps, the Sword on the steps beside him, staring at the battlefield, nobody else around, while off in the distance everyone's celebrating. And Neville, not even realizing he's saying it out loud, mumbles, "I need a vacation."

And suddenly Luna's there, and she's all, "Y'know, I hear Egypt's great this time of year and there's a mystical creature there I've always wanted to find and look I just so happen to have this portkey right here..."

And Neville just stares at her for a long moment and then without even thinking about it grabs the Portkey. And suddenly he's in Egypt, and Luna's running around all excited looking for magical creatures and getting into trouble. And then Luna gets kidnapped by evil archeologists searching for the magical treasure beneath the Great Sphinx, and Neville has to go through progressively more terrifying adventures to rescue Luna and prevent the wrath of the ancient Wizard-Mummy-King.

By the time they're done, Neville's basically become Wizard Indiana Jones, and he and Luna fall in love, and they're riding off into the sunset on a camel, and Luna says "You know, I never did find that Flying Winzegoop. But I heard this /interesting/ story about a cat-dragon that lives in the Amazon, and I /just so happen/ to have this handy portkey right here..."

And Neville's all "WHAT!?"

And then they disappear, off to more adventures.


** Well, now I also want this.

*** I know, right? It just seems like such a shame what happens to Neville in canon, because we're shown again and again that he can be a hero when he needs to be, when his friends are in danger, and that he /wants/ to be, but then in the end he basically just marries and settles down, never fulfilling his potential!

Which is what got me thinking, 'who would help neville become the most of what he could be'? And the answer, of course, is Luna, because she's just understanding enough to 'get' him, and just batty enough to continually get herself into trouble, and probably romantic enough to let him come and rescue her even if she doesn't really need rescuing!

And at the same time, who can help Luna be the best /she/ can be? Neville can help her overcome her issues with just taking abuse like she's been shown to do when her things get stolen. As he's grown as a character, he's learnt to not take unwarranted abuse, something he could slowly teach her both with words and deeds. And he understands what it's like to lose family, just like she does!

** That doesn't really sound like a story about Neville and Luna going on adventures, that sounds like a story about Neville going on adventures while Luna is mostly offscreen as the damsel in distress that needs to be rescued. Personally I'd prefer a story where Luna herself was actually going on adventures, she's one of my favorites and she didn't get nearly enough time in the books, even less than Neville.

But hey in fanfic you can write whatever you want, if you want to see a story about Neville rescuing Luna you should write it.

*** Bouncing off what this person said, I suppose a more feminist variant on the story could be Luna and Neville both getting captured and then having to work together in order to escape. Personally, I always get more out of a story if the couple is working together as a team, as opposed to the standard "prince-rescues-princess" scenario. But you've already got a basic plot set up and you're already coming up with creature names, so I totally think you should start writing this and see where you can go with it. Remember we're all here to give you feedback and encouragement if you need help along the way!

**** Well in my head it was never going to /just/ be Neville saving Luna all the time, just that Luna tends to get in over her head a lot, wandering around not considering the dangers around her, while Neville is constantly terrified of everything and just desperately trying to keep them both alive.

For an example, a scene might go where Neville's following Luna as she follows a trail of some mysterious creature through a jungle. And I kinda imagine it, if it were a movie; the camera is always fixed on Luna, as she's kneeling down and looking at tracks, and checking markings on trees and whatnot, right? But in the background each time she's doing these things, Neville's, say, fending off a flock of flying piranhas, or wrestling with a Werebear, or trying to fight off some sort of carnivorous plant.

And it finally shifts focus when he finally gets caught by the plant, and it's pulling him towards his doom, when suddenly a blast of spell-light comes from the side, and Luna's standing there, hands on her hips, completely clean, while Neville's covered in sap, little piranha bites, and werebear fur. And she's all like, "Come on, Neville dear, do /try/ to keep up."

And she wanders blithely off as Neville brushes himself off, muttering about how he could have saved himself and see if he ever rescues her again. Only for him to hear her scream in the distance and immediately run off after her.

I think for the partnership to be equal they don't have to be equally good at everything, they just need to have equally important roles.

***** OK, that's actually really cute - and it shows that despite how she appears, Luna is quite powerful, but she only uses that power sparingly. I think that correlates with canon very well, and I also think the damsel-in-distress trope could actually work if you did it this way: you'd be subverting the trope by showing that Neville was /also/ frequently in distress.

Even though you say you're not great at writing, I really think you should try this idea out: even if it's just a few scattered scenes here and there, I still think it could be really fun.

**** Yeah, I also get much more out of romance stories when the couple is actually working together and interacting with each other.

That was one big reason I really didn't like Harry with Ginny- they didn't interact enough for me to buy that they had more than lust between them, and he didn't even trust her to go on their adventures with them, just wanted to protect her by breaking up with her and leaving her behind, so she was never really part of the group.

***** Yes I agree, and it was also anti-feminist because it robs Ginny of any agency she had! No free will and no choice! It is ALWAYS like that with superheroes leaving their girlfriends to protect them. Why do THEY NEVER GET A CHOICE? Why do they NEVER get to say "Screw that, I am staying with you and you can deal with it!" I hate that stupid trope it is so frustrating and upsetting!!! And why did JK ROWLING put that in for her male hero when she is a woman herself?!

***** I agree that Harry/Ginny wasn't a particularly well-written pairing (for starters, it should have been Harry/Luna), but I do think we should also pause to consider how Harry's mindset at the end of HBP plays into the breakup:

Harry already feels like so many people have died because of him: his parents, Sirius, Cedric, and now Dumbledore. It wasn't that he didn't trust Ginny so much as he didn't trust /himself/ not to lead her to her death just like he led Cedric and Sirius to their deaths. (After all, who ever wants to be responsible for the death of the person they could have married and had a family with?) In fact, if you recall the end of HBP, he even briefly tries to push Ron and Hermione away as well, but they quickly nix the idea.

Tbh, while this /might/ close up the hole you pointed out in Harry/Ginny's relationship, it also punches a new one in it. Because we can see that Ginny doesn't understand Harry the same way his best friends do: she doesn't understand the reason /why/ she's being pushed away. She thinks it's just a "saving-people-thing", but if she actually knew him better, she'd know it was more than that.

****** It would have been a better pairing if Ginny had been like Ron and Hermione- just not having it when Harry tried to push her away.

But I agree about her not knowing him. It seemed like she mainly had this hero-worship thing about him- she didn't know him very well and just liked the image of the famous Boy Who Lived. Which is the kind of thing Harry normally HATED, so I found it out of character that he fell in love with Ginny.

Honestly almost anyone would have been better for Harry than Ginny, in my opinion- I like Harry/Luna, Harry/Draco, and Harry/Hermione. Harry ending up with Ginny was so disappointing to me.

***** u/Krististrasza:
#+begin_quote
  just wanted to protect her by breaking up with her and leaving her behind,
#+end_quote

By kind of secretly and in private breaking up with her when publicly everybody knew they were a couple. It's kind he didn't think that through and believed somehow magically the whole world would know they were not together anymore.
