If I'm going to waste study time on fanfiction, I want it to at least inspire me. And yes, canon Hermione fits the bill but I don't see that kind of characterization in many fics.


** Try Triumphant the Dreamer? It's a SI/OC as Harry's twin tho, in case that sort of thing bugs you. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12369247/1/Triumphant-the-Dreamer]]

** Linkffn(the pureblood pretense) fem Harry works her ass off to solve her problems and advance her career, academically and otherwise.

Linkffn(the arithmancer) Hermione centric, very hard worker and does a lot of experimentation outside of class.

The protagonist of the YA fiction series The Morganville Vampires is also a hardworking science nerd who experiments a lot.

** I read that as "proctologist" and got some really bad mental images.

Would have been something new, I guess.
