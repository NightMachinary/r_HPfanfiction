Looking for a story I read ages ago. Harry was bitten as a child and Lily and James didn't want anything to do with a vampire Harry so he grew up with Remus. he loved chewing on blood pops and would scare Colin Creevey so much that he would faint every time he ran into him.

I remember laughing out loud at the story I few times but I can't remember which story it is


** Is it maybe linkffn(Twists of Fate)?

*** I refuse to read this story, because if I do it will undoubtedly ruin my feelings on it. In my mind clearly vampires stop aging when they are bit, so the story is just a sassy 15 year old Harry inside a one year old's body. Kind of like Beelzebub.

**** I always assumed that vampires are capable of growing into their "prime", so to say. But thats just how you imagine them. Do they hunt by luring their prey in, or do they just prey by violence and force?

***** Baby Harry would of course hunt by trickery and luring.

****** By being cute. Once in the arms of a cooing woman, he bites.

What an apex predator.

******* I find the scenario you just described sooo much more interesting then another standard super Harry fic. Tiny baby sized Harry, with all the standard fun vampire powers. Hypnotism, Super Strength, Bat Transformation. Hell, just take a standard super Harry fic and replace him with this one and it would be a laugh.

No one would take him seriously, except Voldemort, who could see the monster he truly was.

***** I mean, it's fine either way, it just depends on what route you go. There is the 'Stop aging because there body is dead route', there is also the 'Vampires are shapeshifters route'. Though reading through Harry Potter wiki it looks like Vampires are super weird. They can apparently breed with humans and have partial vampires.

  AU. Bitten by a Vampire the night Voldemort attacked, Harry Potter is believed dead. So what happens when Remus shows up at Hogwarts with a fifth year son bearing the lighting scar and the name of Lupin 14 years later?
