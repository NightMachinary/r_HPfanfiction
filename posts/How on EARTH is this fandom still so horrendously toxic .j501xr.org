** There's toxic people in every fandom. It's the Internet after all. There are also some really good people too, though so you have to appreciate the good.

** I'm not sure if you're just getting that off your chest or actually asking, but in the latter case it's most simply because the fandom is made up of people, just like society, and people are people whether they're out on the streets or at home on their computers. If something exists out there, it'll exist in here. We're not somehow privileged from bigotry just because we happen to like reading a book series. Hell, we probably have some actual Neo-Nazis who read fanfiction.

I take it you expected otherwise?

** It's the internet. People can safely do this kinda shit on the internet with no fear of repercussions. It could be 2576 and it would still be the same.

** It happens to a lot of fandoms, especially ones so big like this one. And you have made up of people of all ages so some of that could be younger teenagers who think they're being a "savage" by doing it

** Harry Potter has grown into a huge franchise, there's always people that are new to it, people that have been in it since the start that may have developed /very/ strong opinions and conceptions throughout the years, people that recall more of fanon than canon and are influenced by its trends, people that really are just doing it to be massive trolls, and people that have known tremendous success precisely because of their brand of bashing of certain characters. Shipping, for some reason, renders itself especially well as a breeding ground for toxicity. That's not just the HP fandom either.

take a deep breath, report if necessary and then just block and forget. I think you'd be happier if you don't bother giving those people the time of day beyond that, though that's of course easier said than done, especially if it pops up in unexpected places. Still, if others rather want to fester into that sort of negativity, let them. It's their loss. I find that it helps to just kick back and imagine them as described in this [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA1bB6WUKkY][song]] when it /does/ get a bit too much.

Have a great day!
