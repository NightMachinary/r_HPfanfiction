First of all, I love this pairing and any recs would be appreciated... but there's this one story that I remember and I can't even remember what platform it was on (ffn or ao3).

It was Luna/Draco and the Weasley twins had them make an unbreakable vow as children that they were gonna get married. They ended up getting married and Luna needs to have pudding every night (per the vow from childhood) or else they lose their magic. They end up liking each other and I think there's something about Luna designing something for Draco's business/brand and everyone really liked it???

Thanks!
