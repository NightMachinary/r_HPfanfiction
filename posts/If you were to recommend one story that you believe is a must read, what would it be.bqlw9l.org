** linkffn(The Unforgiving Minute) is /the/ definitive time travel fix-it fic. It has a horrifying plot line and details just how wrong such a thing can go. Unrelentingly violent, gory and suspenseful, but oh is it written well.

linkffn(Stages of Hope) is what I generally think of first when I think 'dimension travel'. It is dark (not nearly as dark as The Unforigiving Minute though) but has a lot of awesome humor and characters to go with it. Also very well written.

** I always love to recommend linkffn(By Baker Street Station I Sat Down and Wept)

It's got everything that I want in a fanfic, because I've been reading Harry Potter fanfiction for about thirteen years. I read it throughout all of my formative years, and I've gone through every phase. Exclusively one pairing or another, exclusively gen, exclusively dark, any and everything, and this is my favorite story of all time. It's long, centric on Petunia Dursley in a very mature and exciting way. The plot is original and keeps me sucked in, the characters are believable and likeable even with all their flaws. The tag of Severitus can scare some Snape-haters away, but it really shouldn't. In this fic all of his flaws are on flat display. My only issue is that the updates are few and far between, but for such quality I can't begrudge the time.

** linkffn(Honour Thy Blood) is a perfect read for everyone who likes likes a powerful, independed and strong willed Harry in combination with some side story about pureblood culture and a quite ingenious take on magic. The character depiction of some of the more important side characters is sometimes a bit linear and some characteral developments are not thet logical, which is probably the reason why it only has 2.5 stars at DLP.

What I really like about the story though, is how Harry gets motivated and and works his ass off to get the person he needs to be to beat Voldemort, as well as the fact that even though he is a lord and quite rich, those tropes are not that important for the main plot, just for his familial background.

By the way, just yesterday the author released chapter 1 of a complete reworked version of the story, so maybe get into this one as well, as he fixed some style issues.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** Linkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarCat)

It's a must read because it's rather unique in the fandom. The story focuses on characters and how they deal with their disabilities and powers and still go on to achieve their goals. There's very little focus on conflict but when it does occur, it is both well written, emotional and hard hitting.

*** Don't. I have still haven't understood why this is the most celebrated story around. Truly, I don't want to be contrarian, but what the hell? It is overly long, plot is mostly missing, Harry is preachy as hell. Who is able to really enjoy it? Apparently, the world turned to the evil and this is the most successful fanfic of all time. Sad.

I don't have one particular story to read, and I don't think you should have it either. Read a lot and try to find a genre which you like. Why do you like it? Read that. Then read something different. You will find few stories which are good, but [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law][The Sturgeon's Law]] is merciless: eighty percent of everything is thrash. And I think the number is higher with fanfiction stories.

Having said that, here is my ten randomly pulled stories which I have currently in my head. I prefer this is kind of semi-realistic (I call it Magicians' realism) stories from the normal life of wizards and witches. Good story, good characterization, good plot is a way more important for me than superpowers or glorious battles. So, in no order whatsoever:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/mzzbee/pseuds/mzzbee][Series of stories about Petunia Dursley by mzzbee]] ... mostly as an illustration of what I talk about. This is mostly about adultery, trying to find oneself, repentance and reconciliation (hopefully, we are not there yet). Yes, there is some magic.
- linkao3(Hunters and Prey by Northumbrian), but it could be many other stories by him (series of the relationship between Lavender and Mark, linkao3(Tales of the Battle by Northumbrian;Strangers at Drakeshaugh by Northumbrian;James and Me by Northumbrian)), but this is a good representative: yes, Harry is the main character, yes, there is a lot of action and a bit underdeveloped world of werewolves, but it is mostly the human story. Will they overcome their problems? Will other ones survive? Also a bit of mystery story.
- linkffn(Mr and Mrs Percy Weasley by SingularOddities) ... this was originally side-story hidden inside of linkffn(Escape by SingularOddities), which is more mainstream Harmony-marriage-law story (but well written), but readers were so enjoying this side story, that the author developed it is as an independent thing. Yes, it is AU version of the JKR books (AU from the winter of HBP), but suddenly it is more really underdeveloped (by JKR) story of Percy Weasley and his life outside of the Harry story. And again, yes, there is war and drama, but it is mostly about him, overcoming his insecurities and developing a relationship with his future wife (and yes, it is my firm headcannon, Audrey Weasley is a muggle).
- linkao3(The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel) ... yes, it is mostly just a retelling of the book story with Harry being brought up by Grangers and him being an animagus, but it is really not just the same thing. It is more story of all those people who are trying to work together (contrary to the books, where Harry is due to his experiences, almost paralysed by distrust to almost anybody) and the author is making his heroes to work with common sense and not using silly behaviour to keep the story float (really? Going for the midnight duel with Draco Malfoy? Which idiot would do that? Second task of the Tournament where viewers just look at the surface of the lake?). The best part is without question the third year.
- linkffn(Exile by bennybear) ... the best Draco-after-the-war I have ever read.
- linkffn(Puzzle by we-built-the-shadows-here) ... this is in that something-completely-different field: I have never read a fanfic story like this. This is actually a tragedy (like the Greek Classical ones) about fate, heroism and sacrifice. Yes, there is magic, but it is mostly a human story.
- linkffn(Pecan Pie by Arpad Hrunta) ... again something completely different. Just a sweet one-shot, mostly to mention the author, who is the master of writing short stories like this.
- [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=9605][Rows by Antosha]] ... similar in style to the previous one (and these two authors are very similar in their best things, which confuses me a lot): what if Ginny just couldn't take it any more (post-HBP), and she goes to the biggest adventure of her life: driving a muggle train to the Little Whinging to talk with Harry? Again, a sweet romantic one-shot.
- many many others

**** *Sturgeon's law*

Sturgeon's revelation (as originally expounded by Theodore Sturgeon), commonly referred to as Sturgeon's law, is an adage commonly cited as "ninety percent of everything is crap". It is derived from quotations by Sturgeon, an American science fiction author and critic; while Sturgeon coined another adage that he termed "Sturgeon's law", it is the "ninety percent crap" remark that is usually referred to by that term.

The phrase was derived from Sturgeon's observation that while science fiction was often derided for its low quality by critics, the majority of examples of works in other fields could equally be seen to be of low quality, and that science fiction was thus no different in that regard from other art forms.

**** I forgot to add one more as a representative of the historical fanfiction, by which I mean stories outside of the extended FBWFT+HP timeline (basically whole the twentieth century). Most of them are not that good (just a transplant of story in present to the past: princess Hermione must marry unpleasant prince Draco to save her family's fortune; oh well), but some are great. Actually, I'll put here three of them:

- [[https://aaran-st-vines.nsns.fanficauthors.net/Makers_of_Fine_Wands_since_382_BC/index/][Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. by Aaran St Vines]] ... as far as I know the best representative of the subgenre.
- linkao3(Bloodstone by Northumbrian) ... this looks like a story from the Roman era, but it is mostly just filling for the present time stories of the author (I think, it has not been completely revealed yet in linkao3(James and Me by Northumbrian)). However, it is nice and sweet story nevertheless.
- linkao3(7460772) ... I really like this one: great transposition of the magical universe to the Middle Ages where things were slightly more rough, great portrayal of the Franciscan monk struggling with his faith, good original story.

** My answer is always the same. Most longer fics struggle with coherence and sharpness. I also can't stomach all the overused, tedious tropes. Fics need impact, logic, and strong, believable cast that leaves an impression. I suggest this one. linkffn(Things you cannot leave behind)

  ...and finally it was done! But what the public saw as the glorious day of Britain's liberation from the yoke of the Dark Lord turned out to be nothing more than one more funeral for Harry -- a few more friends he had to lay to rest. This time, however, there weren't any left to accompany him. Just where had he gone wrong...? Tragedy, Hurt, Romance...Time-Travel? OneShot

** Bungle in the jungle! The only bad thing is the weasly/Hermione bashing for zero reason, but ignore that and it's FANTASTIC. Has a sequel too.

** linkffn(Fundamental Compatability by HarmoniousConvergence)

Takes a bit to get into, but once you push through the confusing bit, it is so incredibly compelling. Really helps rationalize “Harmony,” and even if you don't like that pairing, this story is so well constructed it is certainly a must read.

  Harry and Hermione react as canon shifts about them. An homage of sorts to H/Hr tropes, beginning after Ron leaves them in DH. Traces H/Hr through the years to the DH epilogue as they struggle to understand the nature of forces that keep them apart and will ultimately bring them together. No bashing, though incorporating angst, mystery, drama, humor, and occasional absurdity.

  Hermione grows up as a maths whiz instead of a bookworm and tests into Arithmancy in her first year. With the help of her friends and Professor Vector, she puts her superhuman spellcrafting skills to good use in the fight against Voldemort. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.
