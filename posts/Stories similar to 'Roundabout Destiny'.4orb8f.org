I just finished reading 'roundabout destiny' by MaryRoyale and I loved it. Found it light and fun, not like other fics I read. And I was hoping to read more stories smiliar to that. Not just Hermione being someone's sister, but something similar. Loved the whole milita and domina thing. I've also read 'The Lost Lupin' so no use suggesting that :) But I do hope for some other suggestions :) not just Hermione traveling back/going back to her AU original time, but others with her.

Thank you!

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)

*** I really liked this. I didn't think I would, so I was leery about reading it. My only regret is that I didn't read it sooner.
