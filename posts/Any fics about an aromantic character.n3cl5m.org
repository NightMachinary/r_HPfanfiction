  Harry Potter doesn't dance. Unfortunately, McGonagall doesn't care about this detail, and so Harry turns to his best friend, Hermione, for assistance. But Harry has a secret, and it turns out that Hermione does too. Together, they waltz to the heart of the matter. A fluffy story about friendship and queer solidarity.

** Probably the only long one, that I can think of is the Pureblood Pretence series linkffn(7613196). There is romance in it, but not the main character, and I think I remember and A/N at some point saying that it would probably stay that way, because she in character has far too much on her plate to consider romance even if she isn't outright asexual.

** linkffn(birth of a nightmare man)

linkffn(The nightmare man)

linkffn(The nightmare man's journey)

linkffn(fractured time)

​

They're all by the same author, Tiro, and it is a four part story. You /could/ stop after pt. 1, 2, 3, or 4, and not read anymore, but they do need to be read in order. Well, actually, you could read /The/ before /Birth of a/ and it'll be fine, just read those two before three and four. Harry is the main character. It starts similar to typical dumbledore bashing whatever, but it isn't really like that, which can be seen if you're not completely blind. Dumbledore and Ron and Hermione, mean well, really, but well... Harry is... Not A Good Person. Er- evil, genocidal Harry who murders people for literally no reason, though he chills a bit eventually, but just a bit. Has +followers+, /servants,/ who he kinda sorta /made/, but also, they have a few issues, but also, murder. Harry is aromantic however, and asexual too. Well, at least he is never in a relationship. He occasionally teases Slytherin (read to find out) about having a crush on him, but Harry never actually has any romantic feelings towards people. Hope this helps.

** I like “[[https://www.wattpad.com/37216658-dursley%27s-daughter-a-harry-potter-next-generation/][Dursley's Daughter]]” by writerer, which is kind of polar opposite of most other stories: there is no violence, not much romance (and not with the main character), just an afternoon TV series of the life at high school. I don't like those, but this story (and its sequel) is rather nice.
