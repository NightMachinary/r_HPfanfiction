I'm looking for fics that delve into transfiguration or charms magic and expand on magic of the HP universe. I'd love to see more magic like the expandable swamp the Weasley twins make in the book, or combining transfigurations to make something new, or complex illusions, etc. Please though- no crack fics centered purely on pranking.

I would also love to see Flitwick or McGonagall in a mentorship role. I'm less interested in 'Harry learns to become an animagus', but if there's new take on that is especially well written feel free to share.

Any main character goes! Any ship goes! If you have other cool expansions on magic in the HP universe, I'd be interested in those too. Cheers!


** The Art of Self-Fashioning goes into a lot of human transfiguration and has McGonagall in a mentor role, but beware that it's pretty dark, read the content warnings and the tags first. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5103614/chapters/11740079]]

*** For some reason I think I've always skipped this one?? Weird because I've read a lot of Lomonaaeren's other works. Thanks for the rec!

** In Wind Shear Harry uses a bunch of transfiguration in battle magic.

In Six Pomegranate Seeds Marcus Flint's mom is a sculptor who uses transfiguration in her work

I swear I've seen more but I can't think of where. I agree that it has a lot of exciting possibilities

*** Thanks! I haven't read Wind Shear, will definitely check it out. I love Six Pomegranate Seeds- might give it a re-read.

I feel like potions and arithmancy are the most frequent magic go-to's in fanfiction. Seems like there isn't quite as much fanfic focusing on charms or transfiguration.

***** It really is. I especially love it for the look into the Grindlewald veterans and just how much of that generation Voldemort managed to take out without anyone really noticing there was a war on. It's a really great fic

**** Yeah totally, potions I can understand because they're super cool, but even then I don't think there are enough fics out there that really dig into them. I did like in six pomegranate seeds all the interesting experiments she came up with like the bombs and stuff, and the crystallised emotions? Metal af!

but yeah, I'd love to see more transfiguration stuff too

** Been while since I read it, but as I recall in "Saving Souls & Healing Hearts" by Batwing Lawyer Hermione's lectures to her Transfiguration classes at Hogwarts are very detailed and contain a lot of magical theory.
