** I presume yes. There is nothing that says it cannot be done, and though the bit about the power of the being painted influencing the portrait might mean that a magical painting of a house elf will not be able to interact with other nearby portraits to the same degree as a wizard's would, it does not negate the possibility altogether.

  However, the degree to which they can interact with the people looking at them depends not on the skill of the painter, but on the power of the witch or wizard painted.
