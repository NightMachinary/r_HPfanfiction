** Have you read the [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][Saving Connor]] series by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][Lightning on the Wave]]? Its an excellent, though very long, series that really delves into the pureblood politics and different types of magic (dark and light).

**** Fair warning (although you may know this if you've been recs for it...) - there's a lot of graphic slash in the later books of the series.

But gods, the pureblood politics is beautiful. Read it for that alone.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7539141/1/Incorruptible-The-Dementor-s-Stigma][Incorruptible: The Dementor's Stigma]] is a pretty decent fic about pureblood politics, centered on the Wizengamot floor.

Oh, and there's a zombie apocalypse going on, too. So there's that. Scenes alternate between the survivors' struggle to help out the muggles and the various power plays going on in the court. Very well-written.

Edit: Damn, forgot my girlfriend was still logged in on her account. Oh well.
