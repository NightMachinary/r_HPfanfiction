  James Potter went five years at Hogwarts without realizing Lily had a little sister. Hermione would have preferred if he never realized she existed. Now she's stuck, in Potter's circle of awareness, and maintaining the timeline. Not like he makes it easy, or something.

*** Exactly what came to mind for me, too! Barty's characterization is so cute in this one.

**** I've always been curious how a person such as Barty could have his less pleasant traits still there, but also portrayed as a pretty regular teenager. I guess I'll give this a shot. Is there any bashing?

Some of Dumbledore. But I don't think it detracts from the story.

****** I'm not sure I'd really classify it as bashing, personally. Hermione is cautious definitely, but I think it's a fairly reasonable caution, just based on his canon actions.

Definitely worth reading, IMO.
