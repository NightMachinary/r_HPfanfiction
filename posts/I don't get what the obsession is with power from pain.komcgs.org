** I think a lot of it comes from the idea that "everything has a price." If you want to gain a new power, then there must be some sort of sacrifice, and pain is the most obvious self-sacrifice. The alternative is to sacrifice an animal or other person.

*** It's a price, but also one that, narratively, doesn't have to matter very much. He's not doing any permanent damage to himself or anyone else or giving up something he can't get back, and he rarely suffers psychologically. If used often, sooner or later he will "get used to" the pain.

** I think part of it is an answer to the question why doesn't everyone do it? If it hurts that bad, it might help explain why the main character is one of the few to do that.

** It's probably mostly due to [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaticSuperpowerAwakening][Traumatic Superpower Awakening]], with some of [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PainfulTransformation][Painful Transformation]] and [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoChallengeEqualsNoSatisfaction][No Challenge Equals No Satisfaction]] thrown in for good measure.

** It may be because it strains their mana/muscles/energy source so much that it hurts. When a character gets a new power it may hurt because of their body getting used to it. They just got a new power, so their mana/body/energy source needs to adapt. In most Fiction stories the energy source is like a muscle, meaning the more strained it becomes, the more it'll heal, and the more powerful it will get. The energy source most likely strains to get uses to the power. Example, What would happen if Harry suddenly got, I dunno, telekinesis. Well, his Magic core would need to grow so that it could hold the power, and grow so he has enough energy to actually use it. His body would most likely also need to grow because it would need to insert the power into his DNA. This sudden growth would result in constant strain, and healing. Causing a lot of pain. Again, this is just a theory.

** Might be an attempt to make the hero less overpowered. "They can do X, but it hurts, so X is not actually that good power." Even if the pain is something that can be handled.

**** I didn't say it was a _good_ attempt. Just seemed like a thing someone might find reasonable.

Then there's the whole "no pain, no gain" philosophy that might be related, of course.
