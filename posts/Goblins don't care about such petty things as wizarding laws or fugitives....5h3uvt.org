Recently-escaped-Sirius-Black, along with wrongly-imprisoned-and-escaped-Harry-Potter, slipped through the front doors of Gringotts before going up to a goblin teller, who raised an eyebrow at their comically large disguise moustaches.

"I would like to speak to my account manager, if it is pleasing." Sirius requested in a vague, obviously-fake Russian accent.

The teller nodded and pulled out an index book, "Your name, please?"

Sirius looked around, making sure the other customers weren't paying attention to him, before he leaned forward and peeled away his moustache.

"Sirius Black." he whispered, before sticking his moustache back on and pretending nothing was out of the ordinary.

The teller raised his other eyebrow, before pushing a button on his desk and whispering Gobbledegook into a microphone.

Then he looked up and nodded, "Nodrick can see you now."

Later, as they were leaving, toting thick almost-bottomless-bags filled to the brim with gold, Harry leaned over and whispered to Sirius, "Is this really alright? I mean, don't they care that we're wanted men?"

"Nah, don't worry." Sirius whispered back, "Goblins don't care if you're a fugitive, they've never given a damn about wizarding law."

Then they turned the corner, and Sirius gaped for a moment before continuing, "Or I could be wrong."

In front of them, the atrium was filled to the brim with people; Aurors, Hit Wizards, goblins, bounty hunters, centaurs, transformed Animagi, house-elves...all armed to the teeth with wands, swords, spears, bows, claws, kitchen knives...

And all of them had their weapons pointed at Harry and Sirius.

"In our defense, there's a very large bounty on both of your heads," Nodrick commented from behind them, "Also, we're total psychopaths, don't you remember back in book 1, how Griphook implied we let thieves get trapped in vaults and starve? Although given he backstabs you in book 7, you could make an argument that he's just a bad actor..."

*** This time? The former. When I want someone to take an idea and run with it, I use the 'Prompt' flair.

In this case, I once-again ran into the cliche of 'goblins don't mind wizarding fugitives coming into their bank', and I decided to write a short subversion of it. I was just in a silliness mood.
