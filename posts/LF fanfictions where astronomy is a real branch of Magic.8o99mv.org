If it was the exact same as muggle astronomy then what is the point of including it in the curriculum? Are there any fanfictions where it's actually useful? Like maybe it can be incorporated with divination or something.

It's useful for herbology+potions and divination. With the first one being more important.

**** Some plants need to be harvested in specific conditions for some potions. We had this for example in case of polyjuice potion.
