I've been trying to recall a fic I read a while ago and all I can remember is that Remus has his own pack of werewolves and they provided security at a wedding, possibly Sirius' wedding. Any help would be appreciated.


** I think something like that happens in A Marauder's Plan. It's not a story I would normally recommend, couldn't even finish it. Good things just keep happening for the characters and there's too much fluff in between.

*** I'll probably finish this story at some point, but dude are you right. I remember distinct at some point that I was just reading, and then slowly but surely I was hit by the realization that the words that my brain was trying to process had no meaning, it was just a whole bunch of words moving through my consciousness signifying nothing and going nowhere.

And then I started reading another story.

I think back on the story without any frustration and with some affection though, so there's that too. Maybe it was just like a train that was moving too slowly for you to realize you were traveling but then when you look out the window an hour later you have moved somewhat and that hour was rather comfortable.

**** My problem with the story is that about chapter 61, the idiot ball makes its appearance and the miscommunication plot device wrecks the story.
