Seriously, MoD!Harry's been done basically any and every way possible by now. What about MoD!Dumbledore? MoD!Snape? Even MoD!Ron or Cedric or Luna or someone.


** The closest I can think of is something like Hermione in linkffn(Hallows and Pathos).

She isn't really the MoD, but thats basically what she is trying to become and take out the current MoD!Harry.

** Canonically Harry could only become MoD because the Invisibility Cloak was passed down through his family line. This still leaves James, James, Albus, or Lily (and maaaybe Teddy) out of the canonical characters as valid candidates to become MoD.

** In Basilisk-born linkffn(10709411), Harry meets someone who... isn't legitimately the MoD, but has all 3 of the hallows and gets them to work together to make him more powerful.

  Fifth year: After the Dementor attack, Harry is not returning to Hogwarts -- is he? ! Instead of Harry, a snake moves into the lions' den. People won't know what hit them when Dumbledore's chess pawn Harry is lost in time... Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!
