I'm interested in finding a long, complete story that pairs Harry with two women. Ideally, Hermione and Luna would be the women, but I'm open to any pairings. I don't mind cliches, classic tropes, soul bonds, bashing (except Hermione bashing), etc. Basically if the story is grammatically correct and is a decently written narrative, I'm game. I also prefer stories that are about the defeat of voldemort. Thanks!


** [[http://mujaji.net/kia/?p=2150][Back to the Garden]] by Antosha is easily the best of the lot, not that that's saying much. The Harry/Ginny/Luna relationship is one of the best I've read.

You can find many more H/G/L stories on the [[http://flamingnargle.livejournal.com/][flaming nargles]] Livejournal, though most of them are smutty oneshots rather than actual stories.

*** [[http://mujaji.net/repository/viewstory.php?sid=173&index=1][This]] is the right story in complete and correct chapter order, right? I only ask because under what is listed as the fifth chapter is a warning that makes me worry that it's order might be wonky.

*** I liked Back to the Garden but the smut feels unnecessary and more detailed than anything else in the story. I liked the Harry/Ginny/Luna relationship though and how they made it work.

** I'm surprised that there are no harry+hermione+ginny stories.

In the books, these two girls got along the best, and ginny seemed to be more competent than Ron.

This trio should be stronger than the one in the book.

#+begin_quote
  Begins right after HBP and goes through summer. Besides searching for Horcruxes, focus is on the relationship between Harry and Hermione. They are the main characters, but it's not necessarily a romantic relationship. Some HG romance in the background.

**** Interesting. I don't particularly remember it being wordy, but I think that was another one that I caught early (less than 10 chapters in). I feel like unless it's super ridiculous when it comes to wordiness (like 10K words of your 15K word chapter is pretty much unnecessary) then it's harder for me to catch that when I'm reading serially.

***** The description itself ticks two boxes in seven signs of apocalypticly bad writers in 'Dumbles' and bashing. Glancing at the actual story, Luna doesn't sound like Luna at all, the time travel mechanics are terrible (Santa? /really/?), Fred and George finish each other's sentences and commentary on HP canon is idiotic.

Oh, and this happened:

#+begin_quote
  His first strike was an assassination attempt against the Queen and Prime Minister.\\
  It failed miserably.\\
  No one in the Ministry knew anything about how Muggles waged war. In retrospect, that should have been obvious; after all, their 'expert' was unable to recognize children's bath toys or even pronounce Muggle words correctly. When grenades and bullets rained down on Diagon Alley, there had been no warning and no quarter.
#+end_quote

Really? Really? The first chapter of HBP makes it clear that Voldemort can kill off Muggles without even lifting a finger. All he needs to kill all the Muggles is a bunch of Dementors. The Muggle PM needs Kingsley's protection to live. This is retarded.

#+begin_quote
  The trio of lovers had been more than willing to remain out of this new war and integrate into whatever society was left, and they would have been safe all this time if not for that red-haired, arse-kissing, back-stabbing coward...
#+end_quote

/facepalm

And all this is from the first two chapters. I wouldn't be paid to read this crap.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it.
