So, there's a thing in Dungeons and Dragons where adventurers are quite weird and separated mentally from the rest of the world - these are people that literally shrug off death and keep going, or can change the weather on a whim, which is utterly mad to a regular person. So, are there any fics that capture that kind of vibe with powerful magic users? Where Dumbledore is almost alien to regular Magicals who couldn't begin to approach his level of ability, or whoever else.

Can also transmit to magic itself, with powerful magic being somehow alien or eldritch or whatever. But I'd prefer fics where powerful wizards are weird and alien to regular people.

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome.


** linkffn(Core Threads) has something like this for the most powerful of magicals. Sadly unfinished though.

**** Wow. Yah. That really describes how this went down. Honestly, by the end I was just laughing, because the plot kinda disintegrated, and it was just random awesomeness. Wish it had some sort of conclusion though.

****** Thanks for the warning, but after scarring my brain with the opening scene of A Veela's Worth, there's not much weird and uncomfortable in fanfiction that bothers me anymore. Not even Darth Marrs and his 'I lace my cocaine with the tears of my enemies' Harry Potters. :D

That's where you thought it was outside the realm of acceptable? Sounds like something a lonely, mega powerful child would come up with. It's silly, innocent and cute. Also sounds weird, wacky, and a bit alien to normal thought.

** There's Harry Potter and the natural 20, by Sir Poley, on FanFiction, where Mili, an adventurer from a D&D universe gets brought to the Hogwarts universe, but he can still use magic, just not like the rest of the cast. He also keeps the rules from his universe, but only for him...

It starts out in first year...

** I think the closest I've come across is linkffn(With Strength of Steel Wings) - powerful magic users there /feel/ different, and have to restrain themselves if they want to go around as though normal - leaving aside some of the less... common forms of magic and the reaction it might cause.

It's not /quite/ as far as what you're saying, but it's as close as I can think off the top of my head.

*** When you say feel different, do you mean in the sense that you can usually pick out a psychopath by feeling uncomfortable and hunted around them? Like, you could pick out a Powerful Magic User by the way you feel around them, sort of a deal? Or is that more of a meta-sense where they feel different to a reader but not to people in the story?

**** Different in that their power is able to be felt by others, in a disquieting way - they can 'coil it' inside them, kept tight in a way to minimize the way the others can feel it, but doing so is uncomfortable. It also heavily disrupts muggle electricity/technology - whereas most magic can still somewhat coexist, the more powerful/heavy the magic is the more it'll short circuit it all.

Basically, when they're consciously hiding their power/holding it tight, they can pass for normal-ish - like how Dumbledore does. But if they /don't/, it can feel like an aura of power pushing against everyone nearby, a bit like static, with the magic flaring up in response to emotions, and that's disquieting for the more normal magic users.

It also can have a mental toll on the powerful magic users - Harry in particular in that story, due to the manner in which he gets his abilities, often has periods where he's clearly not thinking straight or being obsessed with a particular ritual//need/ for magic.

***** Hmm, okay. Yeah, I'd say that meets the prompt pretty well. Feeling alien to people is about the same effect as actually being alien to people, so I'd say it fits.

Thanks for the rec, mat!
