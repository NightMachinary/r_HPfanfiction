** The Alexandra Quick series is pitched at the same level as the original books.

First in the series is here:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle]]

Female protagonist as well, which your daughter may enjoy.

Summary: The war against Voldemort never reached America, but all is not well there. When 11-year-old Alexandra Quick learns she is a witch, she is plunged into a world of prejudices, intrigue, and danger. Who wants Alexandra dead, and why?

Warning: if you look ahead at the summaries of the other stories in the series, there are spoilers for the earlier books.

*** Gotta somewhat disagree with you here. The first Alexandra Quick book is a nice mystery that's in line with Book 1 of canon, it's definitely a kids book. But the second and third are closer to young adult (e.g. HBP, DH), the fourth is verging into adult territory, the fifth is solidly adult fantasy. I think part of that is that Inverarity's ambitions for the series have changed since it started thirteen years ago, part of that is that his small fandom is now (and probably always has been) largely adults.

That said, Inverarity's other fic *Hogwarts Houses Divided* is an absolutely lovely story that's entirely suitable for kids, and feels extremely close in atmosphere to the original books. It is a little rougher writing-wise, but when you're applying that to one of the best pure writers in the fandom, it's a lot better than a lot of other stuff.

Taure, would you recommend Victoria Potter to a ten-year-old? I think at least the first book, and probably the second, is suitable and close to the mood of canon. I haven't read the first book in a while, though, so I could be misremembering.

**** I would not recommend Victoria Potter for a 10 year old - there's some swearing and references to puberty etc. That may well also be the case for the later Alexandra Quick books - I haven't read the later ones.

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

** This one is has Harry and Hermione friendship no romantic pairings. They are 13 but it is very similar in tone to the first book. Gives u all the wonder and feeling of magic hidden around every corner of the castle. It's a mystery. We see Dobby, talk to portraits, ghosts trying to solve. Really nice themes about love and how children can sometimes solve things better than adults because they are more open and genuinely curious. Smaller themes of respect for other creatures, grief/loss, learning from mistakes rather than trying to hide them. Linkffn(The Strange Disappearance of SallyAnne Perks)
