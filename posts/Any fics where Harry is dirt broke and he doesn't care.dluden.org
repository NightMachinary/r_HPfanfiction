** I was thinking of doing a story where Harry doesn't go home to the Dursley's after first year. Once he discovers magic, he's just like... what's the point? So he sort of becomes homeless and meets a community of "Underground" magical peoples who... well, mostly live in the Underground / Tube tunnels. Children of hags, werewolves, squibs, mostly people who didn't go to Hogwarts or otherwise aren't respected by the ministry. Lots of muggleborns whose parents rejected magic or don't connect with their family anymore. He can practice magic during the summers and learns a lot of other useful stuff.

I haven't put too much thought into it, yet, but I might pick it up as a potential NaNoWriMo project.

*** There's linkffn(Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them) about a Harry who gets abandoned at 6 years old in a park and decides he's better off homeless, discovers he has some magic and decides too that he must be an elf.

*** This sounds fun! I would definitely read it! I have a similar fic to this, but mine is a fem!Harry who disappeared from the Dursleys just before she turned 11 and didn't go to Hogwarts at all, lived her teen years in the streets and now just enjoys the simple pleasures in life without caring for magic. Meanwhile, the wizarding world fights its war and tries to protect Violet (after finding her when she is already 18) who's just like 'leave me alone'.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214][The secret language of plants]] has a Harry who was raised by enemies to friends to lovers Remus/Severus, and doesn't care about money or wands and just wants to go home. That's the least of the story, but he's definitely the kind of character you're looking for.

There's also linkao3(firepower by lucy_blue) where he's a squib on the run with Sirius and Remus. Ship-free gen fic.

  Harry James Potter, Boy-Who-Lived, Chosen One, etc. is a squib with no knowledge of the magical world. By general consensus, he is most useful as potions ingredients. General consensus being unanimous agreement by everyone except one Harry James Potter. But who cares about his opinion anyway?(aka: Harry is having a good day, until the part where he gets teleported into a creepy graveyard with some even creepier... cult members?)

I have been more eagerly waiting on somebody to fulfill the plot bunny of linkffn(12278819) ... think Oliver Twist meets HP universe. Modesty self-taught witch (or taught by her Great Teacher ... hmm, who doesn't help her out of her poverty? no idea why) as part of (or leading) street gang of kids on streets of New York.

** In my fic linkffn(We, Harry Potter by wille179), Dragon!Harry accidentally causes a goblin rebellion when he tries to go to the bank while disguised as a human, so not only does he currently not have access to his money, but most wizards don't - including Hogwarts, which is struggling to feed a beast of his size. He's literally resorted to trying to sell his own scales (which are made of mithril) to make back the money he's cost Hogwarts.

He's definitely /poor/ at the moment, though not exactly humble or happy about it.
