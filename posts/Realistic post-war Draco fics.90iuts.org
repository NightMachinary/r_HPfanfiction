Bonus points if it includes the Malfoy's trials.


** The only story I remember having read about post-war Draco is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6432055/1/Exile]["Exile"]]

#+begin_quote
  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

*** I've read that one... Really wish the ending had been as good as the rest of the fic. Felt like it just petered out .

#+begin_quote
  The trials for suspected Death Eaters involved in the Wizarding Wars have begun, and Draco Malfoy finds himself trying to hold together what is left of his family and his fortune, while struggling to escape the looming, almost inevitable future of a lifetime spent in Azkaban. But there is one person who might not have given up completely.
