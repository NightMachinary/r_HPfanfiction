Okay, well We have all probably read a fic where Harry Dies or goes missing at a Young age and the WW ends up without a savior. Double Points if its a Wrong BWL story with plenty of bashing.

Now when Dumbledore realizes the issue and needs a solution.. He and the Order summon a Harry from somewhere else. Maybe from the final fantasy world. Maybe from Naruto universe.. Whatever.

Now my idea is that they don't quite get what they want..

They Do summon a Harry Potter in a way.. They Just get the guy who was Harry Potter.

They End up Summoning Daniel Radcliffe.

And when I say that, I don't mean The Daniel that just finished the shootings of Harry Potter. But the Daniel Radcliffe who just finished filming Guns Akimbo and is working on whatever current crazy sh*t he want to do next.

Maybe Its just me. But I would love to see what kinda Hijinks would happen. Especially since according to rumors Daniel is supposed to be a really chill guy with a great sense of humor. I could totally see him doing some random stuff for sh*ts and giggles.


** Fanfics that involve real celebrities usually end up as cringy worship

*** The Magic Turned out to be the Friends we made along the way.... But No. Just a actor. My thoughts would that he would be under the impression he got kidnaped by crazy fans Playing out a bad fanfic in real life. The first half would be him wondering how they got the resources to kidnap him and pull off the special effects.

** He would know all the important plot details needed like Horcruxes, death eater names .. etc if he read the books which he would have for the movies and then it will be a massive info dump. I always felt the summoning of HPs from alternate dimensions to be a bit iffy ... they are basically depriving the guy of all he knows .. what if their savior has family depending on him in his dimension, they basically killed them as far as he is concerned as they can't meet him and he can't meet them anymore and wouldn't they go to alternate options like hiring mercenaries or begging for ICW assistance or something, we know from Dumbles fighting his boy friend in Europe that there are ways to involve foreign figures in a country's struggles .. anyway here I am using logic in wizarding matters!

** While this could become a Radcliffe love-fest, I can't help but think of its potential, if done well, to be something along the lines of Galaxy Quest, which could be great fun.

*** I agree. If not played up too much, It would make a neat bit of humor. As I mentioned to someone else, A good portion of the beginning would be Daniel thinking he got kidnaped by a cult that has access to amazing special effects and chooses to make a bad fanfic come to life for whatever reason.
