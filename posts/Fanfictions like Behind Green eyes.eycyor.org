I can't figure out exactly what I liked about it, I think I liked the fact that it had a darker harry and dismissed the hp canon as a mere fairytale a delusional witch wrote and sold to the muggles. It was a fairytale compared to the truth.


** There's [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6034766/1/The-Serpent-and-the-Mirror][The Serpent and the Mirror]]. Dumbledore is a psychiatrist who's evaluating Harry, written in the forms of Dumbledore's patient notes for the most part. Harry is delusional and is thinking up the whole Hogwarts story.

  Harry's up for his 7th year and things are going to be a bit different. As he goes through changes, he gains some new allies, loses false friendships, and learns love for what it really is. Not really HBP compliant...but goes with it a little bit

*** I assume it's the one written by AtrumMaximus which also says "rewrite in progress" as it does fit the little information given by OP - I'm not sure it's allowed to be linked here though if I check the warnings in the first chapter... It's on ffnet.
