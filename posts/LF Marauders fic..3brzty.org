Just plain Marauders fic, nothing fancy. Preferably something that follows them from Hogwarts to October 81'. Bonuses if it's long and completed, discovered too many great fics, only to discover that they're only half way through and will never be finished. Thanks for the help!


** linkff(Against the Moon by Spotlight Delight)

- It's not complete, but this is an excellent story about Remus Lupin at Hogwarts. So far, there is 105 chapters spanning across the first two years. The author hasn't updated in a really long time, but she/he has been sick. I know she/he is updating their other story (not Harry Potter) and they occasionally tweet, so there is still hope. I promise it's worth it, even if it will only end in heartache. This is my favorite fanfiction, ever.

linkff(The Life and Times by Jewels5)

- Also not complete. This is a cult favorite. Goes from the beginning of their sixth year to halfway through seventh. Lots of funny jokes and Marauder-antics. Reads like a soap opera...well-written, but definitely junk food. There's a bunch of characters that the story follows. Some of them you absolute hate, and others you can't get enough. She still posts on Tumblr from time to time, so I know she's /alive/, but I've kind of lost hope that this one will ever be continued. This (and Shoebox Project) have defined what Marauder stories look like. I've seen so many wanna-be's.

Shoebox Project

- The bot won't be able to find it. Just Google it, and you'll get a PDF download. It's a Wolfstar story, but the quintessential Wolfstar story. I read it this last summer on my way to LeakyCon and it changed my life (sort of an exaggeration, but it's a good story). I wasn't a Sirius/Remus shipper before then, but now they are like my OTP. I fell hard. Fits your requirements. Goes from Hogwarts to October '81. Written before Deathly Hallows, so there are some things off.

Wish I had more to give you. I love the Marauders, but I'm super picky about how they are portrayed. Other favorites in fanfiction are "The Rise and Fall of the Doe and Stag" and "Boyfriend Trilogy", but they felt kind of flat to me and I didn't persist long. Let me know if you find anything else.

*** I finished 'Against the Moon' a few weeks ago and I felt your pain. I was enjoying it so much! I smashed through the chapters, and all I want is more! I keep checking to see if there have been any updates, but no luck so far.

** I really like this one. It has a darker take on Sirius personality, but the characterisations are all quite good. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1155970/chapters/2345019][The other side]]

#+begin_quote
  When Sirius Black ran away from home, it was the result of five years of being pushed and pulled between his Dark family and his Light friends. Contrary to what he told Harry, nothing about choosing sides had been easy. His friends never understood that. He was just an excellent liar, especially about his loyalty to his Dark past and his role as the Dark Lord's most successful spy.

This is the story of four boys. This is the story of how these four boys came to know each other, of how they became friends. This is the story of their unbreakable bond that could survive any test. This is a story that will ultimately end in tragedy.
