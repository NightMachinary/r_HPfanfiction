Was hoping if there are any fanfics of a foreign Harry, like russian or scandi. Don't really want an American Harry, never really been interested. He doesn't have to be an exchange student or be involved in the Triwizard Tournament even though that seems to be a popular take on things, thanks in advance


** linkffn(11254763) Here Harry was raised by Shacklebolt's family in Africa, I don't remember much else about it... I believe it had Harry x Daphne Greengrass and involved a werewolf from Drumstrang at some point?

  ON HIATUS. A chance remark on the night of Halloween 1981 could have changed everything. Fate throws baby Harry into the custody of Kingsley Shacklebolt, assisted by a certain Mad-Eye Moody. And oh boy, heads will roll and history will change when this gets out. Dear Wizarding Britain: Your saviour has arrived. ON HIATUS.

  Parallel universe time travel? Natasha Romanoff has done it. But meeting Death himself who gives her a baby who's being hunted by terrorists? That's a new one. Simply put, she might need little Harry as much as he needs her. Natasha Mother Figure. T/M rating.
