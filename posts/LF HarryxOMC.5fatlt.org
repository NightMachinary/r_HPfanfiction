Preferably finished, with Harry and an older male. But considering how limited my options seem to be, I'll accept anything decent really. Thanks!


** There's not much Harry/OC slash out there! But one I'd recommend is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1875756][Tempus]]. I loved this fic and definitely wasn't expecting to based on the summary. Most basically, it's an EWE canon-compliant, tightly written, time travel fic with a (somewhat) believable Harry/OC romance (the Draco in this is our Draco's great grandfather). Also there's an awesome mystery, a bunch of action and other plotty awesomeness. The description of the Slytherin common room was also unique and unusual. Linkao3(1875756)

  Did you ever wonder where the Hogwarts disappearing corridors go--or when? When Harry Potter finds himself at Hogwarts in 1927 he never expected that the first person he would run into would be... Draco Malfoy?? 85,000 words. Written for the "hp_cliche" challenge in 2006, run by ReganV. Beta-read by Miraba. Harry is magically transported back to Hogwarts in 1926, and until they find a way to return him to 1997, he is enrolled as a student. The very first student he meets is a blond Slytherin named Draco Malfoy. A time without Voldemort gives Harry the chance to learn things about magic and himself, but that era is not without certain evils. Mixes mystery, romance, action/adventure, and first-time smut. Nominated for a Multi-faceted Award. Additional warnings: Corporal punishment, teacher/student, consensual BDSM as well as dubious consent, torture, alcohol consumption.
