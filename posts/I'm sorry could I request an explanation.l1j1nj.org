Where does the huge "Muggleborns are destroying our culture" thing come from? I need an explanation, so at least fill me in before you start arguing in the comments.


** I don't know for certain, but I suspect it came from one of two places - either a pro-Draco/pro-Slytherin fic trying to make them the good guys, or a Pureblood-Culture fic trying to do the same. There's some feeling that the canon disregard for all Slytherin's being Magic-Nazis isn't the best way to go, so I'd say someone decided to change that and put it in their fic. Then some people read that and thought "Yeah, that's so cool!" and put it in their fics as well. And so on, and so on.

It's pretty hard to pinpoint an exact origin for things in a fandom as old and as large as Harry Potter. Especially given that, in the early days, a lot of things were posted in social media blogs and privately hosted places that no longer exist. But I'd be relatively confident betting on that suspicion.

** I prefer to view fics in two categories.

Those that create a different world/situation so that the racism allegory doesn't exist. Maybe there are similar canon events but you can pull in characters by appealing to things other than “don't be racist”. Like I kind of agree that the Wizarding World is heavily Christianised and maybe it'd be good to explore old and forbidden types of magic (so long as there are consistent values of do no harm etc).

The second are the ones that play the allegory straight and work it into any redemptions or character arcs.

Some others get a little confused or just ignore it and those I can deal with (it's fanfiction, can't be too picky or I'll not read anything). It's really just the ones that royally bungle it up that are a problem and I just nope outta there

**** The usual intended approach is probably as [[/u/Avalon1632][u/Avalon1632]] describes, but the literal nazi dogwhistle aspect is still absolutely an indelible part this this phrase's use in HP fanfiction. "{insert minority group here} is destroying our culture"-type rhetoric has been in use for well over a century now, and has continued to be in use through to current day, which is how this kind of phrase enters public consciousness and (usually)-subconsciously becomes part of people's rhetorical arsenal. From that point on, the authorial choice to use this phrase to "redeem" purebloods is a rather textbook application: given the canonical situation of a minority group who's been dealt incredible violence in the recent past and an authorial desire to explain/justify/excuse/(ie generally blunt to whatever degree) the actions of the perpetrators, sympathizers, and bystanders in both past and upcoming conflicts in the interest of providing "nuance" to those perpetrators, sympathizers, and bystanders, authors will be on the search for some sort of communal deleterious^{\}1]) change experienced by the oppressing group that can be blamed on the oppressed group (^{\}1]) at least in the oppressing group's view), and cultural shift f/ an influx of newcomers (and, more generally, increased cultural visibility of a minority group) fits the bill rather neatly.

** Well, I think part of it comes from the wizards in the books celebrating the Muggle/Christian holidays of Halloween (All Hallows Eve) and Christmas rather than Samhain and Yule. As is usually pointed out in those fics, the Christian attitude to magic-users in the past is the entire reason for the Statute of Secrecy, so why import their holidays rather than the more "traditional" ones?

It's used as the basis for the purebloods' anti-muggle rhetoric, to indicate that it came from a "valid" complaint that got escalated to mindless bigotry.

And when you're discussing bigotry, let's not forget how Hermione says that wizards "don't have an ounce of logic." The reverse bigotry of muggleborns ("Wizards are so backwards! They haven't made any progress since the Victorian age.") is just as bad.

The best (and only, really) treatment I've seen of this in a fanfic:

#+begin_quote
  “What?  Why?” Hermione demanded, clearly aghast at the idea of anyone not hating Draco Malfoy.  “He's absolutely foul!”

  “No more than you,” said Harry bluntly.

  Her jaw dropped and her eyes immediately sparkled with tears.

  Harry fought the urge to roll his eyes.  Merlin, he hated girls!  “My point is that you're both opinionated and prejudiced, Hermione,” he said firmly before she could start crying or leave in a snit or anything else that would cause him more trouble later.

  “I'm not-!”

  “You are,” Harry interrupted before her righteous indignation could get much traction.  “You are prejudiced against the Wizarding World in general.”

  “I'm not-“

  “You /are/,” he cut her off again.  “I've heard you make a thousand little comments that illustrate your feelings on the matter.  You think the Wizarding World is archaic and stagnant.  You see their traditions as outdated and barbaric.”

  “They are,” she muttered petulantly.

  “Exactly,” Harry sighed.  “Malfoy's not that different from you.  He's prejudiced against muggleborns because they come into the Wizarding World looking down their noses at it.  You go ahead and join the world and expect to be treated equally even as you're disdaining everything in sight because it's different from what you've always known.  You think yourself /above/ people raised in the Wizarding World because the muggle world is so much more /advanced/.”

  “Isn't it?” she challenged, her chin tilted up defiantly.

  “No,” he said bluntly, internally wincing at his harsh tone and scolding himself to be careful.  This was a subject about which he felt strongly and he could easily go overboard.  Hermione, like Draco, was extremely opinionated.  If simply told she was wrong, she was likely to clam up and stubbornly believe what she wanted to believe.  The truth had to be spoon-fed to her in order for her to absorb it.  “You think cars and computers and airplanes make the muggles /advanced/?  Honestly?

  “Wizards have been capable of nearly instantaneous travel over thousands of miles for more than six millennia since the portkey was invented.  Prejudice against homosexuals doesn't exist in the wizarding world because the process of combining genetic material from two individuals of the same sex and forming it into an embryo that can be grown in the uterus of a surrogate was perfected eight /thousand/ years ago.  Cancer doesn't exist in the Wizarding World because it was /cured/ eight thousand years ago.  Our healers only see it now in muggleborns, and it can be cured with a single potion.  The Wizarding World has been /civilized/ for over twenty thousand years.  We lived in sprawling cities while muggle tribes still followed herds on yearly migrations.”

  There was a long moment of silence in the compartment while Hermione stared at him in shock and Harry silently told himself to shut the hell up, already.  The arrogance of the muggleborns just pissed him off, and Hermione was one of the worst.

  “The reason that the Wizarding World seems outdated to you is because, over the last three hundred years, since the Statute of Secrecy was established, the Wizarding World has tried to blend into the muggle world.  Bit by bit, they've done so, but they're not very good at keeping up with the constantly changing trends in the muggle world and therefore they /seem/ outdated.  You took one look at them and made up your mind without ever paying attention to the fact that the muggle world's ‘civilization' is an /infant/ in comparison.”

  There was another drawn out silence before Hermione quietly said, “I thought you said you weren't racist.”

  Harry blinked at her, “What did I say that led you to believe I was racist?  What I just told you were facts.  I don't hate anyone because of them.”

  “You hate the muggleborns for not learning more about the Wizarding World,” she said with certainty.

  “Well, if that's true, then I'm not racist.  It's not racism to dislike someone because of their actions.  I only dislike the ones who exhibit that behavior.”

  “So you admit that you dislike me,” she said, her voice quavering on the point of a sob.

  “Hermione, this whole conversation started because I was explaining why I didn't hate you /or/ Malfoy.  I dislike some of your behaviors and opinions just as I dislike some of his.  Doesn't mean that I can't be friendly toward you both.”

*** Honestly I think this is good writing but an absolutely terrible take. Equating support for and joining a the Death Eaters with Hermione making off hand comments is spurious. Its like comparing an Al Qaeda fighter to your slightly embarrassing uncle who makes poor taste jokes out of ignorance. They are not the same thing.

**** Harry's points are also...not great. Wizards don't lack disease, they simply have different diseases. Wizards still have slavery. Cities are not inherently superior to the pastoral lifestyle, and that whole “we were civilized while they were just nomadic tribes” thing is /reeking/ of the same kind of prejudice Harry is decrying.

Why would wizards celebrate Samhain and Yule instead of Halloween and Christmas? What in canon (as opposed to pureblood-pandering fics like the one you quoted) suggests either of those are traditionally celebrated by wizards, pureblood or otherwise?

*** That's pretty much the usual shitty "Death Eaters have valid points" drivel. There's a HUGE difference between Hermione's (flippant) stance towards wizards and Draco "You're next, mudblood" Malfoy. Par for the course for "Harry lectures the ignorant mudblood" stories.

** In one fic I wrote which explored how someone could be radicalized as a pure blood I used 'Affirmative Action' eg giving Muggleborns jobs in the ministry/public office because they didn't have family connections and were disadvantaged as something that Pureblood extremists picked on to argue how Muggleborns had power and influence they didn't deserve.

Those extremists then followed up with 'its our world they shouldn't tell us how to run it' etc and pointed to every Ministry bungle as an example of why this policy shouldn't work.

Later on the radicalized character argues that the Muggleborn Registration commission will help them by making them acclimate.

** I don't know much about where it comes from in the fan fiction sphere, but there IS some backing for it in the magical world. In A History of Magic (the book from the books) there are whole sections that talk about how the magical community was persecuted by muggles, that they were basically tortured and made to perform magic “for muggle ends”, so my interpretation is that it isn't all bigotry. The old school, pure blood witches and wizards were used and abused by the muggle community, and it made many of them pass that fear and hatred onto the next generations. So you end up with families like the Malfoys and Blacks who are seen as bigots for no reason, but who had a lot of trauma back in the day that now manifests as “muggle borns bad”, muggles are bad, we are superior, you can't take magic from us. They don't want to go back to the previous abusive culture, so they stomp out muggle influences whenever they can.

I wish this was better conveyed in canon, but instead it just comes off as bigotry without reason. And isn't that a damn shame.
