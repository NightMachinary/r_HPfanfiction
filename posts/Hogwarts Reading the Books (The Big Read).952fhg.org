I'm searching for a specific fic on fictionhunt called "The Big Read" or something to that effect, but I can't find it. It involved not just Hogwarts, but several others such as the analogous reading the first book. Narcissa was punishing Draco for his rude behavior in the books, and there was something about magical children being precious. It was going with canon pairings.

Any recs are welcome, though.
