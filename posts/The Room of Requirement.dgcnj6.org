Thanks for reading!

The RoR is used in fanfiction so much that I was curious as to what we actually know about it from canon and what was made up by fans after.

** It doubles as Hogwarts Lost and Found, can be as small as a broom cupboard (Fred and George hid in it and they thought it was a broom cupboard) or bigger than the Great Hall, you can limit entry to a single someone or a group and exclude people/hide the door) , you need to concentrate on what you want from the room,

** 1. Can transform into a luxury bathroom (Dumbledore mentions it)
2. Elves know about it (Come and Go room)
3. Isn't confined to school grounds (Neville made it create a secret passageway to the Hogs Head)
4. You can exclude people from seeing the door (Neville hid his base from anyone supporting the Carrow twins)

Actually, the Room appeared to him when he had a mighty need, but all it contained was a collection of magical chamber pots. The Room gave him 'a pot to piss in'.

**** Wait sorry, I was mistaken, thats actually just realistic fandom, i looked it up to make sure. Another thing though is that many students of hogwarts have actually stumbled across it at one point or another (they hid a bunch of stuff in the room of hidden things). Furthermore, it seems that it responds only to the wishes of wizards and witches.

** It doesn't appear to have any limits other than the food and water thing, which seems too arbitrary to be anything other than an artificial limit to keep people from spending all their time in there.

*** Actually it is mentioned in canon that food cannot be conjured (one of the "laws" of Transfiguration). One fan explanation for this is that conjuration isn't supposed to be permanent so the canon explanation is simplifying the fact that the food would have no nutritional value.

**** Sure, but it's never actually confirmed whether the room of requirement conjures things or merely transports them.

***** When Harry and co sneak into Hogwarts in book 7 they find that Neville has been living there and he says when he asked the room for food it produced the vanishing cabinet (the other end was in the Hog's Head). The Law I mentioned previously was brought up as an explanation as to why the room didn't just provide food.

** The Room has several separate functions or modes. The Room of Lost Things appears to store things that people want hidden but not destroyed. I believe the house elves are familiar with that function and it makes sense that they would use it to set aside anything that they can't simply vanish.

Dobby also used it in sick room/apartment mode so that he could nurse Winky through her worst drunken binges.

When Neville had set it up as a safe zone from the Carrows, the room modified its design on the fly to add separate bathrooms for the witches. That said, everyone had to leave in order for the Trio to access it in Room of Lost Things mode, so there are some limitations to the modifying.

The DA training room used in Harry's 5th year provided Defence-specific texts. One would assume that the Room collected or duplicated them from the Library somehow, rather than creating knowledge from nowhere.
