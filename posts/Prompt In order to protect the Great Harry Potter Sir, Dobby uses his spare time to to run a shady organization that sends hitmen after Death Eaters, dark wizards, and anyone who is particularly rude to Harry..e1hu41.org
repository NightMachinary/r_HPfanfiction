** Okay but imagine this: Harry and a girl, let's call her 'Z', are secretly dating. They don't want anyone at hogwarts knowing about them. So they decide to be mean to each other and pick on each other in public so no one would suspect anything. But suddenly one night, when they are taking a romantic walk down the castle grounds, an attempt is made on Z's life. Harry and Z go into hiding as they try to figure out why this is happening, but they are not safe anywhere. They realise the only way to get out of this alive is to kill.

Harry is confused, as to why he is confused he does not know

He has always wondered why all the bad people in his life disappear soon after they either hurt him or were just rude, but Harry didn't mind it.

The Dursleys were the first ones to disappear, Harry didn't know that for a while until he started to wonder why there was no sound coming from outside of his cupboard instead of the usual yells of ‚Äùget up and make breakfast for us‚Äù from uncle Vernon, there was only silence

So then Harry just waited, and waited, and waited, but no sounds came and he was beginning to get hungry and wanted out

Suddenly he heard a pop and the lock on the door to his little cupboard clicked open and Harry heard another pop, Harry quickly opened the door to find absolutely nothing.

‚ÄùWho opened my cupboards door?‚Äù Harry called, and suddenly a small creature popped up in front of

‚ÄùWhat does the great Harry Potter sir need?‚Äù Asked the little creature

‚ÄùUhhh well I want to know who opened my cupboards door and now I have a ton more questions, like how did you teleport there and who and what are you and why did you call me 'the great Harry Potter sir' I'm not that great honestly, I'm just Harry‚Äù

‚ÄùI's being house elf Dobby and I be opening your door, I's not teleporting anywhere, but me can pop around because of magic!‚Äù The tiny house elf, apparently named Dobby said

‚ÄùOkay Dobby, but what did you mean by being able to pop aroung because of magic and why did you call me 'the great Harry Potter sir' I mean, I'm just Harry the freak‚Äù Harry told to Dobby

‚ÄùMagic be real and the great Harry Potter sir is not knowing?‚Äù Dobby asked

‚ÄùNo I didn't know that magic is real dobby.‚Äù Harry said in a questioning tone. ‚Äùand again why are you calling me 'the great Harry Potter sir'?‚Äù

‚ÄùI's calling you the great Harry Potter sir because he be having saved all magical beings from a big evil.‚Äù Dobby said

‚ÄùWhat but I don't remember saving anything.‚Äù Harry said

‚ÄùOh, the great Harry Potter sir was only one years old when he already be saving worlds‚Äù

‚ÄùOh, ok well what can you do?‚Äù Harry asked

‚ÄùAnything the great Harry Potter sir be needing I can do‚Äù Dobby proudly told Harry

‚ÄùOk so can you make some breakfast for me?‚Äù Harry asked and before he could finish there were three omelettes and 29 sandwiches in front of him. ‚Äùwow how is that possible?‚Äù Harry asked and Dobby said ‚ÄùMagic!‚Äù Happily bouncing next to Harry's seat.

When Harry was done eating one of his sandwiches Harry asked if magic could preserve food and Dobby just snapped his fingers and said that the food will stay the same for a week.

Then Harry heard the door bell ring and Dobby said ‚ÄùI be getting it, there be old headman whiskers at door!‚Äù

‚ÄùHello Dobby why are you here?‚Äù Dumbledore asked calmly

‚ÄùI's being protecting the great Harry Potter sir from evils‚Äù Dobby told the old man with a long beard

‚ÄùVery well, may I speak with the young mr. Potter?‚Äù Dumbledore asked

  Harry makes the mistake of letting people around an impressionable poor house elf. Dobby takes his obsessions a little too seriously. Rating for violence. Yes, violence.
