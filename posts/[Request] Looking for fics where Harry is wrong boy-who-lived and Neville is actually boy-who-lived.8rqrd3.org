I'm looking for fics where Neville is the actually boy-who-lived. But instead of protecting Neville, every still protect and regard Harry as the boy-who-lived. Fics can be one-shot or multi-chaptered. Thanks!


** Closest thing I can think of is linkffn(The Return of the Marauders).

Two words: brace yourself.

  James sacrificed himself to save his wife and son. Sirius took them into hiding and trained Harry the Marauders way. Neville became the BWL. That doesn't mean that he's the Chosen One. This is a AU story. Harry/Ginny MA Rating
