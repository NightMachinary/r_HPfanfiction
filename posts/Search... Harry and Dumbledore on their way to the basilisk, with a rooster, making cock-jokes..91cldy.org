I just cant remember wich fanfic that was.... i only remember i lost it at some point and never continued ;)

They where going to slay the basilik and had a rooster with them and bantering back and forth about holding their cock and giving it back etc. Was pretty funny.\\
I THINK(?) it involved some kind of timetravel.

****** If you ignore the overused smut and the rants of the author that really only started up later on, it is a decent read.

Well, if you are looking for entertainment and not some deep romanticised plot or the one and only true love.

****** I said one of my favourites. Delenda Est is probably still number one (that said, The Mind Arts and Path to Power are shaping up really well). For Love of Magic is a guilty pleasure. I enjoy the humor, the shameless smut, the authors take on magic, and it's actually written well.

******* Yeah, I used to enjoy it as a guilty pleasure awhile back until the author just started condoning genocide. That was a bit much for me, and it wasn't like the plot or writing was any good. Anyway, The Mind Arts is pretty amazing. I'm hoping the author would update soon. I don't remember the Path to Power, but I'm pretty sure I read it. It sounds familiar. Is Delenda Est the one that has smth to do with Azkaban?

******** Noodlehammer never said he condoned genocide. His version of Harry does. there's a difference. His version takes the authors feelings, which are merely contempt and dislike, and exaggerates them into a hatred for ignorance going so far as to make an attempt to detroy a religion itself. He ranted about this very thing in his second most recent chapter.

********* You know he is only saying that to make himself seem better.

Harry Potter takes place in the 90s. There wasn't massive Islamic immigrants at that time, and certainly not a Islamic mayor of London. This whole plot shouldn't have ever been a thing. It doesn't do anything for the story. (Harry would be in roughly 38ish in today's society).

He is projecting his own thoughts and feelings to the character. That is like number one of bad writing and character creation.

********** He called people congealing wankstains in that same A/N. How is he trying to make himself seem better? He blatantly states that he's making characters he finds funny, which is why he wrote Harry, and probably Naruto and Xanna in his earlier works, the way he did. That's not bad writing, i doubt any but the most experienced writer could actually succeed in writing a story in which the main character had absolutely nothing in common with the writer. As Noodlehammer points out its a hobby site not a masterpiece collection.

*********** It doesn't take a good writer to write a fic into a dead end where the last 2 chapters were noting but racist rants from his mary sue main character. Then said mary sue proceeds to destroy an entire religion because he doesn't like their beliefs??? At this point the fic is little more than hate speech and I'd be amazed if the admins aren't thinking of removing it.

****** In a word, no. It isn't exactly a cornerstone of the plot so it's really not much of a problem to just skim those sections.

Besides, it's not like we readers don't have experience with blatant hate crimes. The whole overarching plot of the Harry Potter series is literally based on Voldemort and the Death Eaters and entitled members of wizarding society trying to perpetrate a hate crime that's truly massive-in-scale on muggles and muggleborns. If /that/ shit didn't get you up in arms, with your pitchfork and torches out, raging at JKR for letting people like the Malfoys just get away with it at the end, then you honestly missed a bigger opportunity to crusade.

Quite honestly, you're missing /everyone's/ point. You're literally taking fiction and saying that it equates to actual genocide. You can't have it both ways. Either it's /not/ a problem because it's fiction, or it /is/ a problem because hate and discrimination is inherently wrong. I'm shocked that you can't seem to understand the hypocrisy of your own stance.

Unless you're saying Muslims are the only ones that matter and nobody else does, which is a different argument altogether. You won't make any headway on that front, either.
