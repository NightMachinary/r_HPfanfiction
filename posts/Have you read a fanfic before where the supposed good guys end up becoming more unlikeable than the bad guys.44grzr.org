Aparently, unlikeable isn't a word. Odd.


** Yes. Fics like "Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness" or "Knowledge is Useful, But Power is Power", which have completely annoying, unrealistic, self-righteous protagonists, do make me wish Voldemort would just murder them all. "What Would Slytherin Harry Do?" makes me wish Fudge and Umbridge threw Harry in Azkaban, because he is so smug, so confident in his supposed cunning, and completely witless. Basically, in 99% of fanfics the protagonists are characterized so bad that I end up rooting for the bad guys.

********* Okay, so basically it's set in Magical America, and it starts out somewhat similarly to HP - girl is raised Muggle, finds out she's a witch, goes to magical school - but then it gets really dark really fast.

It's /extraordinarily/ well-written. I would go so far as to call it the best-written fanfiction ever, better even than the original series. However, a fair number of readers don't like the main character, mostly because she can be infuriatingly stuck-up and stubborn. TBH I find it a very accurate portrayal of a somewhat maladjusted, aggression-prone teenage girl.

The first book (/Thorn Circle/) is pretty good, but the plot can be a bit dorky in places, and it's a lot of exposition. Once you slog through it, though, books 2 through 4 (/Lands Below/, /Deathly Regiment/, & /Stars Above/) are truly spectacular to read, and the plot and character development are astounding.

** First of all, "unlikeable" is definitely a word. As for fics, /Rise of the Wizards/ did this for me. It started off as a guilty pleasure anyway, but as Harry began to really throw his weight around, reading his POV became even more unpalatable.

Also seconding Firebird Trilogy. That really takes the cake.

*** Powerful!Harry can work, but only if it feels distinctive from the others in its respective subgroup of powerful!Harry fics.

/Nightmares of Future Past/ works well, because Harry is not omniscient. He's often wrong, and the actual writing style is good enough to ignore the cliches. Harry remembering the past and pondering the new present makes the changes in character easier to swallow--Neville's development is gradual for example, and Ron and Hermione still feel very much like themselves. Luna doesn't get enough focus, but I laughed hard at her Patronus.

Or, for a more traditional powerful!Harry fic, there's /The Buttefly Effect./ Due to an unforeseen sequence of events, Harry is raised by Kingsley and Mad-Eye from /birth/ with the implicit intent that they were training him for war. And the fact that Harry is raised in an environment where he was taught to harness his accidental magic and use it as a tool allows for some leeway. The fic isn't great, but it's still better than the vast majority of powerful!Harry fics.
