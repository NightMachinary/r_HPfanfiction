**** Okay I just read through some of this story today, and it's definitely not similar to what I have written down in my story so far! :) the way Lily is, the way the plot plays out, the relationship portrayed between her and Harry, not to mention how ACTIVE she is in harry's life compared to Obscura, is way different and way MORE. My story's definitely not like this one, just like someone who uses a wrong boy who lived trope isn't making the same story as another wrong boy who lived story. :) It has the same basic PREMISE - Lily surviving - but it's totally different in tone and plot and progression.

**** Also a huge difference is definitely that in Obscura Lily is a helpless inactive, standby mouse who doesn't do anything it seems like except watch, whereas in my story Lily is a raven, and she's VERY active and forthcoming, going right up to Harry and using raven vocalizations to talk to him, and spends time with him actively. Not to mention Obscura's Lily seems to be TRAPPED as a mouse, but MY Lily is a standard animagus who can switch back and forth whenever she wants to - and does. So yes, my story definitely isn't like this one! :) I'm super relieved.
