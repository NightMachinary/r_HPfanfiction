Or doesn't have to be exactly that, but somewhat similar? Doesn't have to be the main focus.

Maybe they're trapped because of a spell/potion/curse, maybe they trapped themselves in, maybe something else entirely.

I'd love it if, whoever it is, has to confront their past issues/mistakes and the like, while trapped within themselves, though that's not mandatory.

Can be on any site, can be any length, would rather it be completed but if not that's fine.

Am a fan of slower paced/slow burn stories, but doesn't have to be.

Would rather NOT have Weasley bashing, as I love that family a lot. If there is, I'd rather it be minor. Would also rather not have Dumbledore bashing if at all possible, but if there is, that's okay.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash Threesomes, et cetra.


** Linkffn(the pureblood pretense) This is the first in a very long series and what you're describing is a major plot point towards the end of the first fic. It's a fem-Harry Hogwarts years redo with a few large twists. I love the series, but the premise and the writing is a bit clunky at first--but the writing gets better and the fantastic world building got me hooked.

** There's a fic where someone (most likely Harry, Neville or a self-insert) goes into the mind of the Longbottom couple to appease their mental states and this heals them. Neville gets his parents back and two veteran aurors are back in the field. I don't remember the name though. If someone does, please link.

*** Can I shamelessly plug my own fic in here? It's about an OC who is the wizard equivalent of psychiatrist (and uses Legilimency) and has her own not-fun past to deal with.

It's still in it's early stages, but my most recent chapter is entirely this scenario with the Longbottoms.

** White knight grey queen by jeconais has some of that in it but its not the main focus.

Another jeconais story this means war has some of it as well. Not saying who and why as that would be spoilers.

** This is a dimension travel fic and Harry tries to help out Death Eater Harry by learning about him by entering his mind and memories.

There are trigger warnings though and its a very dark fic.
