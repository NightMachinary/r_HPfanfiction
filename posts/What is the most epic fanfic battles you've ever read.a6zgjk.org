  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

Plus all fights featuring Harry are incredibly creative due to his unique grasp on magic.

** linkffn(11302568)

Hands-down, the Dumbledore-Grindelwald duel in Chapter 19 (Phoenix Ascendant - I). Everything about it from the writing to the plot and the battle itself. This is my favourite battle to read. You don't need to read the rest of the story for this either, it's a one/two-shot chapter.

  They expected him to be a paragon of virtue, a champion of the Light, the personification of all that is good and noble in their world...they were wrong. Explore the legend of a darker Harry Potter, seen from the eyes of friend and foe alike. Multiple POVs. Non-linear narrative. Rated M for violence.

** If this isn't restricted to HP linkao3(kingdoms at war) an asoiaf fic has some of the best battle scenes I've read in any fic. All of his battles are dope as hell but the last battle chapter I read was something else. Fucker wrote a 63k master class chapter to describe 1 battle with maneuver, multiple POVs, and he puts you inside the head not just of generals but of normal people too.

They are far and away better than any battles I've read in hp ffn. They're different not so much of a focus on the arcane nature like HP, but the scope of them is just beyond epic.

The story is also bloody fantastically if you're a fan of GoT, I'd highly recommend giving it a read even if you haven't read the books. You'll have a bit of trouble with some characters and a few plot points that are different but nothing that should really ruin the story and couldn't be solved by watching a YouTube video or 2.

What impact would this have had on the Game of Thrones? Long running story.Comments:"That was f*cking awesome. That was one of the best battle scenes that I have ever read.
