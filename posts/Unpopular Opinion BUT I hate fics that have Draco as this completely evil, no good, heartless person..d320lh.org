Draco was a product of his environment. But u won't defend him and say he was a good person. He was an absolute asshole and held disgusting views. But Draco was a CHILD. A child who got caught crying in the girls' bathrooms. A child who did what he had to do in fear. A child who had to be around a psychopath during his late teen years. If I have to see one more fanfic with Draco being dark or evil, I'm going to SCREAM. Give me redemption fics like he DESERVES.

edit: tl;dr summary of the comments = Draco bad

****** You can, and if you'd tagged it as a request you could rule 9 the naysayers. Unfortunately, because you left it open there it's become more of a discussion and other posters can point out the fact that Draco was a garbage human, still a piece of cowardly excrement immature man-child trying to sell out Harry to save his own skin as of the end of Deathly Hallows (pre Harry's walk to death, where Harry and the gang had to save him from death /repeatedly/ during the Battle of Hogwarts), who we only get a tip of a nod about redemption in the Epilogue and JKR's later online musings. And Cursed Child, of which we dare not speak.

Look: canon Draco is a shit. He /can/ be written well, and even redeemed - for a fantastic crack version, I recommend "Biting The Hands That Feeds," where at the climax of things he's coming off pretty damn heroic while still being his self centered, bitchy self. But complaining because other people are calling him out as a shit, while yourself acknowledging that he's a shit, is gonna see some feedback.

And frankly, at 16-17, you should be self aware enough to realize that murdering a dude, mind controlling people, and sending poison through the mail isn't frigging kosher.

** He doesn't deserve a thing. You are what you are because of your choices.

Draco was obviously influenced by his parents and up bringing, but that doesn't mean we have to feel sorry for him. Not many people paint him as a villain anyways; just an idiot kid who got what he asked for.

Sirius grew up in the same situation while Peter had a relatively normal childhood (as far as we know). And they ended up on opposite ends of the spectrum because of their CHOICES.

Draco crowed and touted blood superiority for years. He insulted and threatened people for no reason other than their upbringing. And then, when people's lives were put on the line, he took glee in taunting and frightening them.

He did all of this because he could. Because he could get away with it.

But what happened when it all came back around? What happened when it was his life on the line and he suddenly found out what it was like to be in the crosshairs of the man he had touted as some kind of savior? He turned in to a coward. Plain and simple.

It was reality hitting in the face hard and forced him to empathize with those same people he had harassed.

So no, he wasn't a villain; But he damn sure wasn't a victim.

It takes courage to walk away from what you had been taught when you know it was wrong. Sirius has it, Draco did not.

If anything he got more than he deserved; he still attempted murder multiple times and orchestrated events that harmed others. Getting away clean was more than he was entitled to.

** Draco was more sympathetic in HBP where he clearly didn't want to kill anyone but felt like he had to because his and his family's lives were being threatened, but no, he didn't do everything he did because he was afraid. He was a bully for many years before Voldemort came back into power, up to and including the point where he publicly taunted muggleborns with the specter of death as they looked upon a seemingly dead cat and threatening message, and then using his power to physically abuse classmates in OotP. That's well beyond being a product of his environment--that's plain monstrous, especially when coupled with the fact that he never apologizes for his behavior or admits it was wrong even once he's older and wiser. Moreover, he's demonstrably a coward in canon, with leaving his friends behind and turning tail and running at the first sign of violence unless he's more scared of the consequences of running, which doesn't leave a lot of faith that he'll have the courage to own up to his bad behavior and change.

Draco is a dick, and he's often written as a dick because that's what he is in canon. I think that there's room for good redemption fics, especially ones that focus on him covering for Harry in DH and on him reevaluating his life after the war, but true redemption isn't there in the text.

** To quote a wise poster (me) in another thread here:

#+begin_quote
  Personally, I feel Draco (through most of the series, up until the Trio were captured at Malfoy Manor and he didn't immediately rat Harry out) was irredeemable because he had no desire to be redeemed. He showed no remorse for his failed attempts to kill Dumbledore that nearly killed innocent bystanders, no remorse for his cruelty in previous years (some of which were schoolboy taunts and pettiness, some of which were outright assaults and blatant bigotry). His breakdown in Myrtle's bathroom might charitably be contributed to not wanting to follow Voldemort's order, but it's equally as likely (and more probably) because he kept failing and he was feeling the pressure coming down on him.

  At no point does he ask for help, at no point does he indicate regret. His failure to AK Dumbledore when he had him at wandpoint (another assault) can be contributed to conscience, but also to cowardice or a weak stomach. He didn't hesitate to (attempt) murder through proxy, but can't do it himself, looking someone in the eyes.

  Life in prison? Debatable. But Draco absolutely deserves punishment, and fics that have him attending an 8th year with the main characters - and especially holy fuck those that have him Head Boy and sharing a suite with, say, Head Girl Hermione - are utter bullshit.

  Draco's been a Karma Houdini all series long, constantly foiled but never neutralized. At the end of things, he deserves his comeuppance.

#+end_quote

Tell that to Dumbledore.

There are various ways of putting this:

- Draco Malfoy engineered the circumstances of Albus Dumbledore's death.

- But for Draco Malfoy's actions, Albus Dumbledore would not have died.

- Draco Malfoy's actions resulted in Albus Dumbledore's death.

- Draco Malfoy's actions caused Albus Dumbledore's death.

Regardless, the "actus reus" element of murder is fulfilled. It doesn't matter that Draco Malfoy did not land the killing blow. He was a significant and substantial cause of the death.

Per Lord Justice Goff in Kimsey [1996] Crim. L.R. 35:

#+begin_quote
  ...in law the accused's act need not be the sole cause, or even the main cause... it being enough that his act contributed significantly to the result
#+end_quote

While Draco's defence would probably argue that Snape's actions were the free, deliberate and informed acts of a third party such that they broke the chain of causation, this seems unlikely to succeed. Snape was part of the same organisation as Draco and was his associate in the commission of the crime. He is not a true "third party".

** Let's not kid ourselves, he was 17 at the time of his various attempted murders. That's more than old enough to understand that killing people is wrong. In 1993, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_James_Bulger][two ten-year-olds]] were tried as adults and convicted of murder, and countless older teenagers have been convicted of serious crimes such as murder and rape.

In real life, Draco Malfoy would have been sent to prison on multiple counts of (potentially racially aggravated) attempted murder.

The defence of duress would not have been available to him. Duress cannot be used as a defence for murder or attempted murder.

Per Lord Hailsham:

#+begin_quote
  Other considerations necessarily arise where the choice is between the threat of death or a fortiori of serious injury and deliberately taking an innocent life. In such a case a reasonable man might reflect that one innocent human life is at least as valuable as his own or that of his loved one. In such a case a man cannot claim he is choosing the lesser of two evils. Instead he is embracing the cognate but morally disreputable principle that the end justifies the means . . It may well be thought that the loss of a clear right to a defence justifying or excusing the deliberate taking of an innocent life in order to emphasise to all the sanctity of a human life is not an excessive price to pay in the light of these mechanisms'.

*** *Murder of James Bulger*

James Patrick Bulger (16 March 1990 -- 12 February 1993) was a 2-year-old boy from Kirkby, Merseyside, England, who was abducted, tortured and killed by two 10-year-old boys, Robert Thompson and Jon Venables. Bulger was led away from the New Strand Shopping Centre in Bootle as his mother had taken her eyes off him momentarily. His mutilated body was found on a railway line 2.5 miles (4 km) away in Walton, Liverpool, two days after his abduction. Thompson and Venables were charged on 20 February 1993 with Bulger's abduction and murder.

** Also, just to put my two cents worth in. I believe Draco should have gone to Azkaban with a reduced sentence due to his age. Tom, and Harry grew up in pretty similar environments, but Harry was still a good person, while Tom was a little shit. Do you think we should redeem Voldemort, no. It's the same for Draco, yes he had shitty choices, and his upbringing left a lot to be desired, but that doesn't mean we should hand wave away all the bad crap he's done under the pretense of a shitty set of circumstances. Hitler had a crappy enough child hood, should he be redeemed?

Also trying to hand wave away the shit Draco did is also basically saying that all the people he hurt are worthless compared to him. Your doing a disservice to the victims, because he can be, ugh, redeemed.

Also trying to redeem Draco without punishing him does state that you believe his victims are worthless. You believe that the victims shouldn't gain restitution, because Draco is what...a coward?
