****** So, that claim is actually based on a single study done back in the 80s that didn't even take into account that lgbt fans existed. Sure, a percentage of straight women write slash, but I'm willing to bet a significant chunk is also written by fans who identify as lgbt. On that point, it's actually I would say extremely likely that whenever lgbt writers /are/ writing, there's gonna be some M/M or F/F pairings, because to do otherwise would be to be erasing themselves from the world - and we in the lgbt community like to, in general, include ourselves when there is a chance to do so.

There's also the fact that we don't see M/M, F/F etc. relationships as inherently unnatural or something we would have to reach to include, like some straight authors might.

******* You're being extremely aggressive and rude when I merely raised it as a possibility that most slash is read and written by women. I was unaware of that study and it was not the reason for my perception that that might be the case. I agree that gay authors and gay-adjacent authors exist in the community and like to depict people resembling themselves and those they know. Nonetheless, we should expect that effect to be small (even if gay authors are somewhat overrepresented in fanfiction communities!) because the majority of fanfiction writers are still het as a consequence of the majority of the overall population being het.

I'm not erasing people, and I take pains to understand the world outside my bubble. Don't make me regret it.

From my perspective what influenced my response is that I (and many other lgbt people) have until recently found fandom to be in general a safe and welcoming space, but that's started to change over the last three or so years with an increase of people starting to ask for 'no slash', suggesting that slash is - or /should be/ - a niche interest, rather than part and parcel of the wider scope of fanon, people 'forgetting' about slash pairings when doing a survey, etc. etc. Creating the overall impression that fanon and the fan community is moving, like the real world - that we come here to escape from the issues with - to push us to the margins, too.

Again apologies for my tone though. You were only repeating a commonly made claim that is to most people expressed as a common truth.

Perhaps the wearer is covered in mud or stained with something you can't (or wish you couldn't) identify. Details like that help support the plot.

** The same as with any fiction - completely different handling of characters' emotions.

Additionally men are more likely to focus on character overcoming their problems, whereas women write more about effect of the problems on protagonist.

And of course pairings. If it's slash it's almost certainly written by a woman unless it's Dumbledore/Grindelwald. If protagonist has a harem, a fairly safe bet that writer is of the same gender. Draco/Anybody and Snape/Anybody are usually also written by females, whereas when Harry is paired with non-OC Slytherin girl or Fleur (unless it's fem-Harry).

He spills wine over her dress and instead of vanishing the spill there's an awkward scene where the girl takes a shower and they end up making out in sleep clothes afterwards. Things start to get serious but they have to call the thing off due to a lack of contraception. Instead of doing what sex deprived adults (and we are talking about a several-year-long dry spell) would do in that situation (oral sex, magical contraception, apparating to the next gas station and buying a pack of condoms or not caring and getting moring after contraceptives) they settle on sleep.

It is so obvious that the author was female from this scene alone and the whole "I am not ready to have sex but will come to his son's birthday" thing was the reason I dropped the fic. If you write adults your characters should behave like adults, not like in a T rated high school romance.

Younger, less experienced writers have fluffy ships as the main focus, though a lot of them also have clumsy descriptions of sex; I have no experience within the HP fandom for this age group, and my acquaintances come from the RPF communities in K-pop.

I suspect I've been guilty of writing super-meaningful sex as a shorthand for emotional revelations myself. In fact, I know I have.

IIRC, this is even brought up in the stories and then attributed to Dresden being lonely and finding every woman to be more attractive than they really are.

And a lot of the women he interacts with have supernatural origins to their beauty, like the fae.

It's a genre thing, one I'm not fond of so I can't really go into detail, since the formula aspect absolutely kills any interest I might have in them. Not just because it's romance, but because I'm bored to tears by vampires, werewolves, alphas, packs, "tramp stamps," inherited specialness, and so on.

Question--does knowing that a female wrote that passage color your perception of it? I find the whole thing regarding male vs female voice/writing styles to be very interesting. I think that there is a definite sort of slant to how male authors vs female authors present things, but it just goes to show that one can't always tell. There is definitely a long history of women writing under male names such as George Sand and Andre Norton to overcome publisher/reader bias.

I'd say in general adolescent boys have more physical energy than adolescent girls, and they jostle each other and horse around more; of course, society encourages that behavior in boys and discourages it in girls.

Boys also do remarkably brash and idiotic things in school, such as daring each other to slide down stair rails on cafeteria trays. Since the stairs themselves are made of concrete, this is usually a bad idea.

** A lot of females tend to think of colors in shades when describing something. Something isn't just red, it's burgandy. It's not green, it's emerald green.

Other than that, I feel that men tend to write Harry much more assertive compared to female authors (when they do, it tends to go more towards aggressive). The reverse is also true except men I feel tend to either make someone with tomboyish or girly without any inbetween. I think that this is because of confidence and relatability. Men understand Harry because he is male, so it's easier to make him assertive; women on the other hand don't feel as confident about the male mind and so either make him more passive - generally needing advice or seeking advice for choices - or aggressive - veering the other way.

Female writers also tend to not have Harry have a straight male friendship scene. Usually it's either talk about plot or heavily influenced by stereotypes. Otherwise you tend to get male/female friendship scenes or male/male/female friendship scenes. Neville also tends to be a stand in for a female if a male only scene is meant to happen due to being sensative, shy, and kind.

Females tend to write Hermione better than she is, and usually has the narrative be on her side when she does something wrong. Likewise, Ron usually ends up in the wrong. For instance, you are more likely to see Harry being "lazy" when learning because of Ron.

Petunia tends to be forgiven or redeemed more often by female authors. Vernon usually ends up as abusive towards her to explain it. Men tend to hate both Dursleys.

Like when the female characters are walking stereotypes or have conversations no female would really have. Like, i was reading a fic with fairly well-written male characters, but in the only female-only scene the characters sat around discussing their weight and clothing. Definitely not a female author lol. (Same goes for male characters, if they seem super unrealistic to how men usually act you can probably guess it was written by a lady.) Stories where the female characters experience sexism or just generally joke about female only topics (aka things like periods/makeup/ect.) the author is probably speaking from experience. If a story ever has a sub-plot about a doucy-male character getting his comeuppance for being a sexist prat, it's a pretty good sign that the author is a lady.

It really stands out in Marauder fics.

Just seems like an unnecessary descriptor. It's like describing the color of the sky, except you're not illustrating any difference from what the reader would perceive it as, if you hadn't said anything. It's not a red sky, or a purple and pink sky, it's just... normal. Average. Situation normal. It's a waste of time to describe it in any sense other than to distinguish a change.

***** Actually, one reason the word 'cisgender' was coined was because of the embedded biases in the assumption of "normal." If there's no word to specify "gender assignment that matches biological sex," the implication is that it's the assumed state, and deviance from it is always noted. If you're not "normal," many cultural attitudes imply there's something wrong with you. At least in the US, where I live, "normal" isn't value-neutral. It's considered baseline superior, a majority membership that can be used as a club to beat "not-normals" with. By recognizing that cisgender exists and giving it a term to distinguish it from other genders, it re-positions it as one gender identity among several, by far the largest, but not therefore entitled to value itself above all others.

It can sound preachy, and it's sometimes irritating because fandom is nothing if not loud and proud about its internet activism, but it's actually a useful term. Like various language shifts over the years, it might help influence acceptance of other people's legitimate experience while calling things like "normal" into question.

Being at home with your gender and your body is really not comparable to saying the sky is blue.

That's what makes its use as a descriptor pointless, unless you're using it to distinguish from transgender people. But if you're describing say, Harry, and you go through the whole, "black hair, green eyes, scrawny, glasses, lightning bolt scar," and then you stick in a, "cisgender," all I can think is, "Why?" Cisgender is the baseline, there's no reason to mention it in that scenario (hell, there's not really any reason to describe him at all, we're all pretty well acquainted with his baseline appearance, but it's a common thing), because that's what everyone is going to assume. It's just a waste of time for everyone involved.

******* Oh, that I can agree with. I back-click right out of fics that use recent terminology devised for political or psychological purposes. That's not who these characters are. That's not how they think of themselves. It completely throws me out of the story. To be clear, I can imagine someone writing a good fic exploring gender confusion, but it would still have to be in the character's voices. The moment the fic starts throwing around words like 'cisgender' or 'demisexual,' the writer's agenda intrudes and the fic is ruined. I'm not here for issue fic - I'm here for id fic, the tropes and characters that push my buttons, and the writers who can make me care or surprise me with good world-building. I'm also here for the porn, but even there, the same priorities apply.

******* Mm-hmm. That's a lot of hostility over a term you're not even required to use. So nobody can say you're cisgendered (which isn't an insult, btw - it simply means your body and your sense of gender match), while /you/ can not only tell people they're weird, you can define what society means by "weird." And that it's a "victim's" own fault if their life sucks, because you know this, how?

To bring things back around to fanfiction, I /will/ agree that I'm personally not interested in seeing the terminology imported into stories. I prefer to see difficulties and sexual confusion and transformation dramatized, and in HP I want it to be British and magical and conveyed through a character's POV.

******** I'm an aggressive guy, can't help it. I'm fully aware cis isn't inherently an insult, it's just a pointless word at best and it frequently is used to speak about a group of other people in derogatory terms.

Your argument is literally "well trans people felt sad that they have a word about them that identifies them as abnormal (which they are), so there should be a word to identify straight people so they don't feel as bad??? How is that not absolute nonsense?

I grew up in Idaho, and I have a gay best friend. He's a very masculine dude, you'd probably never be able to tell. He can't stand a lot of gay guys or SJW culture because it's so frustrating to even have a conversation with any of you. It's only black and white, right or wrong, cis/het or trans/gay. If you disagree you're an asshole at best or hitler at worse, but if you agree you're an "ally".

********* Well, I can't say it's been a pleasure, mate, but I worked 12 hours today and I'd rather go do something I enjoy than answer your comment point by point. I will tell you something I suspect you already know, that young uni students (if we're going to lump people together) are always obsessing about the latest theory or cause or future as a way of defining themselves and test-driving their world views. Sure, it can be maddening. Sure, some of it is bullshit. Yes, most of their passion achieves fuck-all in the world because they're talking rather than doing. And yes, there /are/ a bunch of special snowflakes running around, and I thank fuck I'm not a college professor. Believe me, there are a plenty of people out there who would agree with everything you say and go even farther with accusations of abnormality and false victimhood. But whether you like them or not, concepts like cisgender are still useful tools. I won't bother talking about why, because apparently the language created to discuss sociological changes and sexual differences gets your back up.

Ah, the "you people" put-down. I'm not a social justice warrior. Social justice, hell yeah. But the fans who perform social justice as a way of winning ship wars are toxic, and they distort the very idea of what activism means. They're also weirdly puritanical, and their version of fandom is about the most destructive and unfun way to practice a hobby I've ever seen.

In any case, I'm off to write about Snape now. That generally puts me in a good mood. Cheers.

***** So are you also against the word heterosexual, for the same reason?

And in context there was a clear reason for the descriptor of cisgender...transgender men don't tend to fetishize breasts so heavily to the point of obsessing over them. Just as lesbians and bisexuals tend not to. For the most part, it IS just straight cisgender men who are that obsessed with breasts to the point of going on and on about them unnecessarily in fiction, at least in my experience. Like, there's a difference between just liking breasts and finding them attractive and absolutely obsessing over them, and I do notice it's really just straight cis men who are weirdly obsessed over them.

In the context of a conversation that includes a persons sexual preferences I don't care, this conversation does so it's fine. The problem I have is that people (like yourself) use these labels to group up "others" and slap some weird preconceived social rules to them. Such as being "weirdly" obsessed with breasts. Who gives a shit if a guy, or even all guys, love(s) breasts? Get over it, you sound like such a pompous ass lol. I knew a girl once who loved being peed on. She was obsessed with it, wanted it every day. That's objectively much weirder than this, but would I ever shame her for it? Absolutely not.

This is just like when people shit on other people for not liking the same foods as them. I don't like sushi and I've had people give me disgusted looks for saying that before. Like come on, grow up.

***** I don't read fanfic for battle scenes, so I'm not the target audience anyway and I tend to get impatient with lovingly detailed slaughter. In my (limited) HP circles, it's true that most of the women I know don't create plotlines that require major battle descriptions or fights.

In published fiction, I suppose it depends on whether you're looking for something like Monster Hunter or something like the WWI Regeneration trilogy. Very different approaches to "fight scenes."

****** You're taking far too hardline a view on this.

A fight scene is merely a literary tool, and a well done one can really make a story stand out. Fight scenes often require a different 'basic approach' to writing, mechanics-wise, that can really highlight an author's talent.

Little is more boring than overdone/excessive/needless fight scenes, however. And it's just as bad when an author writes a long conflict but doesn't have the writing chops to cap it off with an appropriate fight scene.

Sorry, what?

Yeah, a fight scene is a narrative choice, and I completely agree they're hard to do well. POV is tricky, sentence structure is important, pacing, knowledge of weapons if you're using weaponry, ability to keep it in character, etc. And I disagree that 'little' is boring - it depends on the intent. Spare writing can be a gut punch. Overdone fight scenes = skip that sucker, who the fuck cares after the fifth jaw punch or dismembering spell? Unless the writer is really good and focused and doing more than just listing mayhem. And yes, fade to black is as frustrating in conflict as it is in sex scenes. If you give us the build-up, don't cheat on the payoff.
