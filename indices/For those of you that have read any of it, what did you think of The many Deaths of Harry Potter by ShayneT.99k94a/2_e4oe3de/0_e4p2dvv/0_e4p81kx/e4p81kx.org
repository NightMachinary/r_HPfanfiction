It's kind of like powergaming. I haven't read the fic in a while, but from what I read, Harry seemed to know things it made no sense for him to know, and he used that knowledge to his benefit. In other words, it was as if he was a character controlled by a gamer that knows how the game is played and forgoes roleplaying entirely in order to 'beat' the game.
