  Christmas 1999: an untraceable poison is sending the magical world into a panic. As an employee in the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes, Remus is caught up in the investigation, but he's as lost as everyone else... until he has an almost miraculous encounter with Severus Snape, whom everyone thought long since dead.
