You can't do much better than linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time by joe6991)

Linkffn(The Power He Knows Not by Steelbadger) is very good as well.

Linkffn(To End in Serenity by Matt Silver) is quite good if you like golden trio fics.

For something a little more canon you can never go wrong with linkffn(The Strangers at Drakeshaugh by Northumbrian) which features basically every post-DH canon ship and more.
