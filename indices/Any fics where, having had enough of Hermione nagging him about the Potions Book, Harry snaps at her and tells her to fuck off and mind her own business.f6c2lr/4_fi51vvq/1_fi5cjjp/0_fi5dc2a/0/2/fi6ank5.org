Yes, it's not a cheat sheet if it works and is well explained. The problem is, it does all the solving and none of the showing, and it's /not well explained/. Harry doesn't bother to even consider thinking about the showing, really; he just does what it says and succeeds, and doesn't think about any of the theory behind it. That's as much of a cheat sheet as you can possibly get for a practical class.

I actually like Harry better than Hermione, but I think there are rational explanations for Hermione's behaviour. Yes, she was being overly nosy and unpleasant about it all. However, Harry is cheating his way to success here, so her being unable to stand him showing her up due to cheating seems perfectly logical.
