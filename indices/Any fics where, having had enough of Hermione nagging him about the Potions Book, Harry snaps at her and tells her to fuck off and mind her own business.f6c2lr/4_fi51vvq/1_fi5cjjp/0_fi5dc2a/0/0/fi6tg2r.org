  It's not a cheat sheet. If it works and is *well explained*.

In this case, there's none of the theory behind it - it's just a bunch of scribbled notes/instructions that say *what* to do, but not *why*. But it is in potions, where we don't see them do that in canon at all - however, if we assume that they did get some understanding of the theoretical parts of potions during their classes/years at Hogwarts, the Prince's book is certainly less explained.

I think the more important note/clarification towards your last point is Harry being better than her at Potions /without earning it/. She's (at least IIRC) not mad about him being better than her at Defence, because he's worked hard at it. But something like the Prince's book /is/ cheating, IMO.
