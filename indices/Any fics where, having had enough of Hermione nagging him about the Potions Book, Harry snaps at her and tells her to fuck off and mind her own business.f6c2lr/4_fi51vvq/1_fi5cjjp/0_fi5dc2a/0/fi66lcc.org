It's not a cheat sheet. If it works and is well explained. If Harry would have been like Oh okay Hermione, let me share this book with everyone, Hermione wouldn't even be able to say anything.

I love Hermione, but the whole potions book thing drove me crazy. Part of it was because she was worried that the book wasn't that good in potions, but when it turned out it was, she wanted to get rid of it because she hated that Harry was better at a class other than Defence.
