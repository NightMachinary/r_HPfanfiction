Yes, because it's also basically a cheatsheet, and no actual hard-working student wants to see someone else surpass them because they are, effectively, cheating. What would an honest student do with a cheatsheet? Destroy it. Do you support academic dishonesty?

Plus, once again, it's not like Harry actually understands any of the concepts; while everyone else is figuring things out, he's out there scoring at the top when he really doesn't deserve it. He doesn't bother trying, either, and is happy to just muddle on through until it either blows up or he gets to his exams and realises he doesn't know a thing without the special modded text.

Sure, Hermione went about it in a bad way and was awfully jealous. But to act like Harry's in the right for 1) using someone's scribbled margin notes that could endanger everyone in a subject that's very dangerous when screwed up just because he's lazy, and then 2) continuing to use it even though it's a cheatsheet and dishonest, is really something.
