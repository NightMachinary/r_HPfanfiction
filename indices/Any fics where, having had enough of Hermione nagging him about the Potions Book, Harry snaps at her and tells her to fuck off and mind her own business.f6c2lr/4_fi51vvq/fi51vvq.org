Hermione's an absolute nag and annoyance for it, but Harry's also following the equivalent of a student's untested annotations in a chemistry manual with all the reagents and instructions altered -- except the possible outcomes include "sending the whole class to the hospital wing" instead of just "making mustard gas". I mean, would /you/ want to be in a class with someone doing that sort of shit?

Yes, it works for him, but Harry really shouldn't be encouraged to chop and dice random ingredients according to some sketchy old margin jotnotes when he knows neither the former owner nor enough about potions theory.

edit: It's odd how some people can't accept that Hermione being horribly, annoyingly nosy and Harry being dangerously stupid in his desire to take shortcuts are not, in fact, mutually exclusive. Too close to home?
