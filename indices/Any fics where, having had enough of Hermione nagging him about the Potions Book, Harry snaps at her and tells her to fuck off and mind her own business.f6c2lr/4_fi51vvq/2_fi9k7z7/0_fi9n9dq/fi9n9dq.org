As far as I'm aware, she doesn't (?), but I haven't read that book in quite a while, so I'm not a good source, lmao. However, I was also kind of addressing the issue from a reader's perspective, because so many people seem to look at the situation and go, "wow, Hermione's being such a bitch, Harry should've just told her to fuck off!" without really giving it any thought. From an outside perspective, it should be possible to see that Harry just leaps into it and trusts this random old book -- even though it's got instructions that aren't just slightly different, but /really/ different -- for no good reason, then acts like there's no problem at all.

As for the Weasleys -- yes, I suppose that would probably be true? However, I don't think it'd be nearly the same thing as Snape's book. I think it'd be reasonable to assume that the Weasley notes would be more along the lines of things to look out for/be careful about, and not completely modded potion recipes and instructions that simplify hard potions (Draught of Living Death, which Hermione couldn't make, despite making Polyjuice in 2nd year) to the point where even Harry (a mediocre potioneer) can make them. Not everyone has Snape's talent at & interest in potions.
