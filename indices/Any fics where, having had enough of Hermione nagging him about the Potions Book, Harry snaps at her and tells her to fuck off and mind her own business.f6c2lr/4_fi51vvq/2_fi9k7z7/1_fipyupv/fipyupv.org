I don't know about the Potions, but she certainly expressed safety concerns around the spells Harry was learning from the book. There is an exchange in Chapter 12:

  Hermione had not cracked a smile during this anecdote, and now turned an expression of wintry disapproval upon Harry.

  ‘Was this spell, by any chance, another one from that potion book of yours?' she asked.

  [...]

  ‘So you just decided to try out an unknown, handwritten incantation and see what would happen?'

  ‘Why does it matter if it's handwritten?' said Harry, preferring not to answer the rest of the question.

  ‘Because it's probably not Ministry of Magic-approved,' said Hermione. ‘And also,' she added, as Harry and Ron rolled their eyes, ‘because I'm starting to think this Prince character was a bit dodgy.'

  [...]

  ‘That was different,' he said robustly. ‘They were abusing it. Harry and his dad were just having a laugh. You don't like the Prince, Hermione,' he added, pointing a sausage at her sternly, ‘because he's better than you at Potions --'

  ‘It's got nothing to do with that!' said Hermione, her cheeks reddening. ‘I just think it's very irresponsible to start performing spells when you don't even know what they're for, and stop talking about “the Prince” as if it's his title, I bet it's just a stupid nickname and it doesn't seem as though he was a very nice person to me!'
