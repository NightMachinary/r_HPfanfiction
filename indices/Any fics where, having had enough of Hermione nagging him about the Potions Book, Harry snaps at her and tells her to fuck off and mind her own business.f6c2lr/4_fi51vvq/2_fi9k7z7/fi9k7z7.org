I may be confusing canon with fanon and if so, I'm sorry. But does Hermione ever bring up safety concerns? I remember her more complaining it wasn't the 'proper' way to brew. Everything Ginny and Ron own is second hand and I would imagine have student notes in there somewhere. Hermione's not complaining about those, she's whining because Harry's taking what she considers shortcuts and it's working.

Harry has a used textbook and he's trusting the previous owner knew what they were talking about. And really, after the first potion it readily apparent they did. And with hindsight, it's literally a teacher's edition. Which, I guess is cheating. Hermione was right. All Hail the Great Bushy One!
