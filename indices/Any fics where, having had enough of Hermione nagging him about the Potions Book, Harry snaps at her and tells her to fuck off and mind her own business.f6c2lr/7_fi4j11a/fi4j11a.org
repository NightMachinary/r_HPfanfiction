I probably would have had words with Hermione about how she acted in hbp but I wouldn't speak to a friend like that. Swearing at friends when your joking around is fine, but seriously telling them to fuck off is grounds for a fight. If I was in Hermione's place Harry would be getting a couple punches to the face.
