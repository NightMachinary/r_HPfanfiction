She also mostly follows the rules, which means /putting your hand up before you speak/, which, again, she mostly does. How is it leaking knowledge if the teachers are literally picking on her to answer? There are multiple scenes in canon where she's waving her arm about and a teacher actually ignores her. If anyone else is competent enough, they can raise their arms and try to answer as well. If they're not competent enough, they have only themselves to blame.

You can't just blame Hermione for all the classroom's woes if 1) the teachers choose her to answer, or 2) nobody else bothers to even try.

edit: Also, the point of being /taught/ is literally to have someone else teach things to you. It doesn't necessitate having to learn all of the material yourself; if that was necessary, why would they go to class to have things explained to them? They're in a school. With classrooms. If everyone were an autodidact, then teachers would be out of a job.

It's fascinating that you would operate your class on some sort of reverse-merit system where the capable are to be punished despite all reason, but fortunately, Harry Potter's classroom system and most real-life classrooms don't work in such an inane way.
