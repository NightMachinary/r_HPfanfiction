I'm sorry, what? Harry Potter should know Potions because he was a celebrity? Wow, that's not some extraordinary pressure or anything. Do you realise plenty of real-life celebrities have poor schooling achievements?

Also, Harry is literally only a celebrity because he didn't die. He spent ages with the Dursleys living in a cupboard and didn't know he was a wizard, much less a celebrity, until just over a month before that class. I doubt the Dursleys really prioritized the educational success of their kitchen slave.

There's a difference between not encouraging the top student and /actively giving them detentions for answering the questions that you yourself pick on them to answer/, which is what you said you would do.
