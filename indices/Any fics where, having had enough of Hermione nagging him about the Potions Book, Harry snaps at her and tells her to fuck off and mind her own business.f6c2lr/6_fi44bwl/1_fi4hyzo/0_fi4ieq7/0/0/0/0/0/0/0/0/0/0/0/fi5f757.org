Do you really think Tom Riddle, who wanted to be the best and unsurpassed, never answered questions in class?

That's a flimsy excuse for Snape. You can also argue that because he was pretending to be a good guy, he would need to treat all the students decently to really pretend to be "reformed". He was an arse to Harry because he wanted to be, not for some great plot or other.
