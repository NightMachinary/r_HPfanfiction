Encouraging the meriting students is a very good objective one I do try to attend. But I do not thing encouraging geniuses those students that are far advanced is a objective that should be prioritised over the objective to try to motive those own motivation are far behind. Yes I would prefer to not encourage the one genius if the rest of the class is far behind that one genius.

And Snape did have a good point, the draught of Living Death, the bezoar and monkshood and wolfsbane are in Magical Drafts and Potion by Arsenuis Jigger, the first year potion textbook. And Harry Potter was a celebrity, he should be an example of success.
