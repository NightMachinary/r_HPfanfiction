Why would there be punitive actions? Once again, Hermione answers questions when she's called on (except for the notable example from an /abusive/ teacher. are you an abusive teacher?). Do you punish students for all of your mistakes to try and "control their eagerness"? Have you considered reflecting on yourself instead?

Maybe, just maybe, if teachers didn't want Hermione to answer, they wouldn't pick her!

  I doubt that I would have the patience to support her eagerness for very long.

By...gradually punishing her more and more and then eventually giving her detentions because she...wants to learn and is answering questions when /teachers/ choose her? You're crazy, absolutely crazy.

Harry Potter and Tom Riddle are two entirely different people. Different people react to events differently. Why does Harry have to try to "win" over these things because /you/ would do it if you were Harry? You're /not/ Harry, books aren't real, and you can't just say "because /I/ would do something, Harry would too!" Why does Harry have to make an effort in a Potions class to show up Snape just because /you/ would? Good for you, but once again: you are not Harry Potter.

Also...you're using Tom Riddle (canonically a sociopath/psychopath that becomes a crazed mass murderer) and Snape (canonically a bitter, vengeful man that's nearly 40 targeting and bullying 11-year-olds because he hated their parents) as "good" examples. Riddle and Snape are blatantly neurotic in canon, and yet they're your "ideals for normal behaviour Harry should aspire to"? Absolutely insane of you.
