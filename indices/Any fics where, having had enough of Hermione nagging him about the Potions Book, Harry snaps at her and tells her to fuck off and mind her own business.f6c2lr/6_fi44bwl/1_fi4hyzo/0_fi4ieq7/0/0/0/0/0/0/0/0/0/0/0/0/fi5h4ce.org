Severus Snape is a very ambiguous and complex character that has very human flaws. It is not an surprise that J K Rowling needed to tell Alan Rickman the secret behind the always for him to play him so well. Rowling agrees that Snape will always be too ‘grey' to truly like, saying in one tweet, ‘You can't make him a saint: he was vindictive & bullying. You can't make him a devil: he died to save the wizarding world.'
