So you're saying you wouldn't encourage merit or excellence unless you literally had no other choice? And people who want to contribute more will have to just...wait in the wings until the teacher arbitrarily deems their participation to be an acceptable last resort?

That's positively ridiculous. Are you actively trying to kill off all desire to learn and participate? I hope you're not really a teacher and all this "my class" content is internet posturing.

Let's say that your assumption that all schools require students to read the full textbook before their classes is true (even though it isn't true in HP, btw; Hermione reading through all of hers is just to emphasize that she's a SWOT). You still don't need to punish students for their lack of work ethic via in-class questions, because, surprise, practical lessons and homework and exams exist in HP...and also in real life! A teacher cannot possibly get a decent margin of most of their students' progress just by asking one or four questions to everyone in class. They wouldn't even be able to ask enough questions for all the students.

And frankly, your argument about punishment for lack of knowledge for questions is asinine. Let me spell it out for you: if you ask the whole class a question, and they know that they'll be punished (with House Point deductions, etc.) if they answer incorrectly, nobody who isn't sure of themselves will bother putting their hands up and answering (if you don't ask them directly, like Snape did). Even if they don't get punished, they'll still look silly, and won't be rewarded with House Points unless they answer /correctly/. All of that is incentive for them to leave the questions to the smarter students, because House Points are serious business in Hogwarts. Unless you think students have somehow all become gluttons for punishment?

So then you either have to ask all your questions individually (i.e. be Snape), or you have to accept that some people will answer far more questions than others if you address the whole class, because some people are more enthusiastic about learning than others. And if they answer more questions because /you literally pick them to answer them/, then what, are you going to punish them for /your/ choices? Friendly reminder, you said this:

  She would have received multiple detentions in my class and lost many points.
#+end_quote

But most of Hermione's answers were, once again, because she was picked by the teacher after she raised her hand. Do you give out detentions for your own flawed judgement? How ludicrous.

Yes, an exception is when Hermione interrupted Snape during the first lesson when he was /actively targeting/ Harry in order to /embarrass and mock/ him. Is that supposed to reflect poorly on Hermione, when Snape was being purposefully malicious? Snape wasn't trying to make Harry "learn", and he wasn't punishing Harry for some greater cause. Are you really using Snape as your ideal instructor? Snape, probably the worst non-DADA core teacher in canon? That's fantastically silly.
