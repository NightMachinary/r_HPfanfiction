Why should he?

Harry doesn't know that he's meant to be Tom's equal until he hears the prophecy in his fifth year. Not everyone has lofty goals to be the best and brightest. And if you want someone to be the best and brightest, well, isn't there Hermione?

Oh wait, you hate her so she's not acceptable, lol. It's fine if Harry tries to be the best because of some prophecy, but if Hermione does it, she should get detentions for being too eager? Are you listening to yourself?

Because, yknow, if Harry was the best student, he would /also/ be answering all the questions, because that's how you get the image of being the best student.

I'm sorry you actually approve of a teacher that blatantly bullies an 11-year-old-child that was habitually abused at home and lived in a cupboard when he's at the tender age of nearly 40, but that's an issue with your own moral compass, not mine.
