You are right I spoke with too much simplicity. My punitive actions would have been gradual from the point of order to detention. What I wanted to say is I doubt Miss Granger would have succeeded in controlling her eagerness and that I doubt that I would have the patience to support her eagerness for very long.

Tom Riddle didn't let himself be beaten down and Harry didn't even try. Did Harry try to best people expectations of him ? I doubt it. The BWL should be the best in DADA and so is Harry. Prof Snape accused him of not bothering to open the book . If I was Harry I would have made my goal to become the best potionner just for it to be wrong. Harry has chosen to let him win by not making any efforts.
