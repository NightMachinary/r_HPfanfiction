Of corse not my point wasn't as extreme as the two of you made it. If no one knows the answers then if she is putting her hand up I would most certainly accept her participation but only if no one else know the answer.

And if I let one person answer all the question, others would not be punished for their lack of work. I recall that she interrupted Professor Snape when he was asking Harry some question on ingredients and Hogwarts Potion Curriculum in the first potion class.

You may believe that Harry didn't deserve it but he didn't even open the books before coming to school. In my class students are to at least read the books of the year in advance. The teacher role is to explain the notions that are hard to understand not to read the book material that the students should have done. And if a student can't answer one question by lack of knowledge Deduction is still possible.

And the episode of Snape potion book does tell us that she cannot support the books being wrong. She lack the capacity to thinking critically and going behind the Knowledge. Even if Harry was wrong to not search to understand the why .
