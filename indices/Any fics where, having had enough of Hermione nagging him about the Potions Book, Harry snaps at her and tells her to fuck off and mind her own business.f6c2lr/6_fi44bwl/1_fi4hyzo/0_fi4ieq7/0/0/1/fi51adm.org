I didn't see your edit, so I'll address it here. Snape's potion book is the regular equivalent of some guy writing down random chemistry reagent substitutions and other junk in an old chemistry lab manual. Would anyone rational trust that? No. Even if it's right once or twice, it's still potentially dangerous, especially if you're like Harry and you don't bother looking up the reactions behind it all.

Potions is a subject where mistakes can create noxious gas, land kids in the hospital wing, and melt through floors. The potions themselves can also have dangerous qualities. Sure, Hermione's a nag and annoying and probably jealous about it all, but Harry is a kid with minimal knowledge of the theory following random modded instructions...and you think he's right?
