I will plead Guilty to the second point I did not like her at all. She seems to be for me someone that has allowed Harry to become too lazy. I do not think Harry would have achieved his destiny without her, he has become far too dependent on her. I would have preferred Harry to be more like Tom, striving to be the best at school and in live. Harry could have become Minister If he was more ambitious and worked harder. By having her doing the research of Knowledge for him, Harry didn't need to do it himself because he expects her to have the answer for him in a platter. Not something I would have liked to see in the hero of the story.

For teaching you are right I do not have the patience in me to teach children that do not have motivation to support my too high standards. That is why I chosen to not teach at all and save the poor children from my eternal displeasure.
