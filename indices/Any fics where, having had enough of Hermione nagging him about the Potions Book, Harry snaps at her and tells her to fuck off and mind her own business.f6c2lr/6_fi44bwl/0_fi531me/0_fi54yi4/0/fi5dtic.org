Of course Harry could have been Minister. But why would he want to? Becoming a politician isn't for most people. Ambition isn't for most people. Research isn't for most people. Just because you're the hero of a series, doesn't mean they have to be ambitious or hardworking.

Also, wtf, Harry did lots of his own research. I don't recall Harry ever expecting an answer from Hermione. From Ron, yes, because Ron knew stuff neither Harry nor Hermione did, but not academics.
