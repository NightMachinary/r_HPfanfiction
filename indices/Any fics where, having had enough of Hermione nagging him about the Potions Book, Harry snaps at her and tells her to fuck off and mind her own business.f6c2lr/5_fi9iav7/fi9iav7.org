One of the first things anyone says to her in Mad Fairy's Say a Prayer is "Would you shut the hell up, Hermione? I'd like to sit down before we get to Hogwarts! My trunk is heavy!" Trigger warnings: This series is really over the top at first and pretty cracky. The bashing of Ron, Hermione and Ginny fades away during part two into a great story about a, uhm, wizard space program. Did I mention that it was over the top? It is. Over the top, that is. Part two tones it down a lot, but the first one is like a completely different fic compared to the rest. linkao3(4629198)
