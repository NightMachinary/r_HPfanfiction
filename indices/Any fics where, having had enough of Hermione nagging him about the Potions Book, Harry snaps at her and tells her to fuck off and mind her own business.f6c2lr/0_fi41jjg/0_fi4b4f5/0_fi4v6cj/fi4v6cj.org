Depends. Words like that are not spoken in a vacuum. For Harry to have said them, something must have been different about Harry, about Hermione, and/or about the history and the dynamic of their relationship.

Since people who write scenes like that tend not to be fans of Hermione^{1}---or at the very least want to see her put her in her place---there is a very high probability that any fic that features such a scene will also bash her before, during, and/or after that particular scene.

^{1} --- Well, OK, I can see someone like Pstibbons maybe writing a scene like that to bash Harry as being unfair to Hermione, or some Dramionist breaking up their friendship in order to then have Draco catch her on the rebound.
