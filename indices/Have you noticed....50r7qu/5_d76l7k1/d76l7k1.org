I know it's been said, but wars tend to make people marry at an early age. Back when the Iraq war was around, a friend of mine married his wife and got her pregnant before he left. The short amount of time that you're married is bliss and it'll make you happy that if you don't make it back that you at least were married to the love of your life.

This may not be facts, but Hitler did the same thing. Perhaps for another reason, but he knew he had already lost when he married.

Also, just 'cos they live for hundreds of years, doesn't mean that they can bear children beyond 50.
