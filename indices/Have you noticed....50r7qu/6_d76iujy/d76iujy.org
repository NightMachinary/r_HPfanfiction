Canon, while life expectancy (the average age of death) may be higher among magicals, there is actually very little evidence that magicals can live significantly longer than the oldest non-magicals. The oldest documented human IRL was 122 and there just aren't any magicals we know of who lived significantly longer than that (besides the Flemels). Bathilda Bagshot is the likeliest but she also /could/ have died in her 120s.
