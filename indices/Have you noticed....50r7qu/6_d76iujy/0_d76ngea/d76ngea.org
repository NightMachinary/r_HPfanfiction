Armando Dippet lived into his 300s, and there's no evidence he used anything to artificially extend his lifespan. Faris Spavin died at age 147. And there was some guy in Philosopher's stone who was in his 750s and there wasn't any indication that he used any artificial means to extend his lifespan like the Flamels.
