Marrying young could be a symptom of magical wars hanging over their head. First Grindelwald's war, then the two Voldemort wars. If shit hits the fan, people like security and marriage is just the right thing to make that feeling of security sprout.

I also don't buy too much into the idea that muggleborns go back into the muggle world for good. With the exception of Voldemorts agenda, muggleborns didn't have too bad a standing in wizarding society, actually. Fanfiction makes it sound a lot worse than it was. If we take Pottermore canon, there even was a muggleborn minister, Nobby Leach.
