This seems to be a rather semantic point. When I said "they only recruit someone every few years" I took it to be clear that it means that they only /successfully/ recruit someone every few years (i.e. make an offer), not that they mysteriously close applications for years at a time. The quote I used to back up my position was rather clear on that front.

And in any case, the semantic point makes no difference. Either way - closed applications on high standards - the substantive fact remains the same: there's only ever likely to be 0-1, at the most 2, trainee Aurors at any one time.
