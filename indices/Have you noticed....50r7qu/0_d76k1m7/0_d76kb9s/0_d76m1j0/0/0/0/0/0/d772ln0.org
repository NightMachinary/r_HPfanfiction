I agree that fanon tends to trivialise aurors, but I don't think that McGonagall implies that they only take one every fw years. WHen I read that it's more of a "It's hard to get in and not many people try to" vibe.

Basically you have to pass certain standards and if you can't make it your out, even if no one actually passes that year. The fact that they haven't taken anyone the last few years only means that no one got in, not that they weren't accepting.
