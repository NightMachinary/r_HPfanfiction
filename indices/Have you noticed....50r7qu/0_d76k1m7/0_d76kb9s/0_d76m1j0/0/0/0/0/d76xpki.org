I am sure. Here's the quote from OotP Chapter 29:

#+begin_quote
  "Yes?” Professor McGonagall prompted Harry.

  “Well, I thought of, maybe, being an Auror,” Harry mumbled.

  “You'd need top grades for that,” said Professor McGonagall, extracting a small, dark leaflet from under the mass on her desk and opening it. “They ask for a minimum of five NEWTs, and nothing under ‘Exceeds Expectations' grade, I see. Then you would be required to undergo a stringent series of character and aptitude tests at the Auror office. It's a difficult career path, Potter, they only take the best. In fact, I don't think anybody has been taken on in the last three years.”

As for whether it's too few, it makes sense to me. The population of wizarding Britain is small, maybe 10,000 people, and Aurors aren't police, they're elite Dark wizard hunters. There can't be all that many Dark wizards out there. I've never imagined there being more than 20 of them, perhaps closer to 15.

Another useful quote from OotP on the matter:

  “A regurgitating toilet?”

  “Anti-Muggle pranksters,” said Mr. Weasley, frowning. “We had two last week, one in Wimbledon, one in Elephant and Castle. Muggles are pulling the flush and instead of everything disappearing - well, you can imagine. The poor things keep calling in those - pumbles, I think they're called - you know, the ones who mend pipes and things.”

  “Plumbers?”

  “Exactly, yes, but of course they're flummoxed. I only hope we can catch whoever's doing it.”

  “Will it be Aurors who catch them?”

  “Oh no, this is too trivial for Aurors, it'll be the ordinary Magical Law Enforcement Patrol - ah, Harry, this is Perkins.”

Fanon has a tendency of trivialising Aurors, turning them into regular law enforcement as opposed to Ministry-sanctioned bounty hunters. But in canon they really are considered the cream of the crop. Yes, Dawlish got beaten easily by Dumbledore several times, but if you base your idea of who is a strong wizard on the set of people Dumbledore can't beat, it's going to be a very small category indeed.
