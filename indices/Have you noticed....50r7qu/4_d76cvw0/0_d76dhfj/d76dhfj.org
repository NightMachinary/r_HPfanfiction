I agree and disagree.

We have kids young because women don't have forever to have kids. I can see this more with the men. Since it's a magical world /maybe/ women don't go through menopause at age fifty like Muggle women would, but we have nothing to suggest otherwise. Which means if the men decided to wait they'd have to marry women much younger than them. So maybe it's just a social thing where big age differences is looked down on OR that so many people meet their futures spouses at Hogwarts that men don't wait because the women they fell in love with /can't/ wait. Since the whole Tonks/Lupin thing him being too old for her was part of the reason, he didn't want to date her. Although the werewolf thing seemed to take more importance there.

Although, I agree that, just like with our society, people would be getting married and having children a bit later. Like when we died young (in our forties/fifties) girls married in their early teens and normally had their first child by their late teens. Now we don't marry until our earlier twenties and normally have our first child in our twenties (on average, of course).

Birth defects in children rise if you have your first child after the age of thirty with it becoming higher the older you get. But beyond health reasons (because magic can explain that away), it could just be a culture thing. The magical community is small so having children might be top priority to most of them where having a career doesn't seem all that important to many of the characters there.
