Marrying young when they live longer has always bothered me as well, and I agree that it makes no sense. If you're going to live to a hundred and thirty, it seems like there wouldn't be a rush to marry and start pumping out kids as soon as possible. Like, you have some time to make sure you find the best match possible.
