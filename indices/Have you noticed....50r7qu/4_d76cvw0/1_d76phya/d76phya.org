We don't know that every couple married young. We see that James and Lily married young, and that Molly and Arthur have been together since atleast 1970 (around Bill's birth). The only other two weddings we see are Bill and Fleur, who are at least 25 and 20 respectively, and Remus and Tonks. Tonks is around 21-23 years old, and Remus is in his mid-thirties, possibly older if werewolves age faster. Most people end up in relationships that are rather long term for the first time at this age.

We also know that most couples meet in hogwarts, which is understandable. Imagine being with someone for 7 years, every day for at least an hour. It will quickly create lasting relationships, either of spite, respect, affection or even love. People who go through experiences such as what would occur in hogwarts will bond strongly. Even if we assume that Harry's six years were abnormal years at hogwarts, every year would have shocks.

It is not surprising to see people marrying and having children at young ages, not exactly in that order of course. For all we know, wizards have issues procreating without marriage. WE DONT KNOW.
