From what I've always understood, their living longer is just a byproduct of them not being affected by Muggle diseases and the like. They only live so much longer because they aren't dying from things like measles or complications from Alzheimers.

As for marrying and having kids, well, I'm sure women still worry about their clocks. So, having kids before your forty is probably still something they strive for. Also, as important as it is to enjoy their youth, they also live so much longer than Muggles. That means their golden years are a lot longer too. So if they didn't get to something they wanted to do before they had kids, they can just do it after the kids have left because do have extra time to kill.

The solution for the Muggleborns worrying about Muggles noticing how long they've been alive seems pretty simple to me: move to a new town.
