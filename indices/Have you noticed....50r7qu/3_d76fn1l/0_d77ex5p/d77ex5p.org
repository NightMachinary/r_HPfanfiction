  From what I've always understood, their living longer is just a byproduct of them not being affected by Muggle diseases and the like. They only live so much longer because they aren't dying from things like measles or complications from Alzheimers.

Albus, depending on which recon you go by, was about 115 years old and still strong and active enough to run a school, hold all his political positions and had no hint of being even close to retirement. Gellert was living in /horrible/ conditions for over half his life, and still made it to 115/116 before he was killed (again he didn't die of old age). Bathilda Bagshot was at least 20 years older (and probably more then that considering she was Gellert's /great/-aunt), still living independently and active before she died. Even the healthiest muggle can not claim to live to 135 and still be as fit as when they were in their 50/60s. It's a little more then good health care at work (and JKR's crap ability to count).
