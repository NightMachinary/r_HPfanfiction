I think you need to make Hagrid's reaction much less extreme. Maybe have him allow them to come along but have Harry notice how uncomfortable Hagrid acts and Harry can ask him about it later. It would be less jarring and would actually build up a bit of suspense as to why Hagrid is acting so oddly. As it is now it feels like it all comes in a rush. And it also doesn't seem in Hagrid's nature to be so cold to little kids like that.

Someone else mentioned it and they are right...he wouldn't refer to them as Hufflepuffs...maybe it could be changed to them coming from a long line of Hufflepuffs.
