From an objective standpoint, you're right that they're not Hufflepuffs, but that's not how Hagrid would phrase it. If he were more precise with his speech, he'd be particular. But we're talking about Hagrid. Speaking of which, unless they stop being little kids after a couple of months, please recall that he wasn't exactly nice to Malfoy when they headed out into the Forest. Considering that he *liked* Harry and nevertheless sent him into the Forbidden Forest with a boy who hated Harry and a cowardly dog . . . I can't see him really understanding how to treat children.
