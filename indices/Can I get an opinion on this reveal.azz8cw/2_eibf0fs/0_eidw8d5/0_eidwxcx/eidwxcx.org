I get what you are saying but in canon Draco had given Hagrid tangible reasons for disliking him by the time they served detention in the Forbidden Forest. Draco had insulted Hagrid and Harry multiple times at this point. As the passage is written Hannah and Susan are perfectly nice and sincerely friendly with Harry...the exact opposite of Draco.

I'm sure Hagrid has nothing against muggles but he clearly is insulting and hostile to the Dursleys once he sees how horrible they are, particularly in how they treat Harry.

As far as sending Harry and Draco into the forest alone I chalk that up to Hagrid being clueless to the inherent dangers of certain things...not cruel.
