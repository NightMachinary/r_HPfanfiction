#+begin_quote
  “Oh! There's Hagrid,” Harry said cheerfully after only a few moments outside. The large man was approaching, ice cream in hand, though he paused when he saw Susan and Hannah. “Hey Hagrid! How are you feeling?” Harry asked.
#+end_quote

I would get rid of the “cheerfully”. Adverbs like this tell rather than show and you usually want to limit them. Think of how you can show the reader that Harry is cheerful. Maybe have him wave? “Oh! There's Hagrid!” Harry gave the large man a cheerful wave as he approached them, two ice cream cones in his huge hands.

#+begin_quote
  “Alrigh'. Who're these, then?”

  “Hello, sir. I'm Hannah Abbott and this is Susan Bones. Are you alright?” Hannah frowned as Hagrid paled rapidly. “Harry said you weren't feeling good, maybe you should go back to Hogwarts? Mum and dad can help him get the rest of his things,” she offered.
#+end_quote

“Rapidly” here is again telling rather than showing. It's not especially important how quickly Hagrid pales, just that he goes pale at the sight of Harry with the girls. You can get rid of it and not miss anything. WRT to “mum and dad”, when you're using them as names, they are capitalized. “Mum and Dad can ...” But, if you say, “My mum and dad,” then you don't capitalize them because you're not using them as names in that case.

#+begin_quote
  Hagrid stared at them until a drip of ice cream rolled off the scoop and hit his hand, the chill apparently snapping him out of his shock. “Harry, come on,” he demanded. Harry jolted at the tone of his voice.
#+end_quote

Again, an adverb. Take about “apparently” because it serves no purpose here. The “Harry jolted ...” is awkward here.

#+begin_quote
  “But-But I was hoping we could go together. We were going to have lun-”
#+end_quote

At the beginning of this sentence would be a good place for a reaction from Harry rather than the “jolted” in the previous sentence. Example: Harry stared at Hagrid who was now looking rather angry and he searched his mind for how he could have possibly upset him.

#+begin_quote
  “No. Not with them. Come on. Now.”

  Harry glanced at his new friends, who looked quite intimidated by the giant man's sudden change in attitude. Hannah bit her lip. “It-It's okay, Harry. We can just . . . We'll give you the stuff dad's bought on the train. We don't want to cause trouble . . .”
#+end_quote

Capitalize “Dad” here since Hannah is using it as his name.

#+begin_quote
  Seeing his new friends upset stirred something in Harry: a long beaten down hero complex, a desperate need to have their approval and affection. He rounded on Hagrid. “No. These are my friends. I want them to come with us,” he said firmly.
#+end_quote

Hmm, this doesn't seem to go too well here. Are you telling this from third-person limited (only Harry's POV and what Harry knows) or third-person omniscient? It doesn't seem to me that Harry would be aware of any sort of hero complex inside of him, so as a consequence, this is telling the reader what's going on rather than having Harry himself show the reader through his experience and actions. I think you can get rid of the hero complex stuff and focus on the fact that he's an 11-year-old boy that's never had any friends and suddenly here are two friends that he's being forced to leave for some sort of adult reason he doesn't understand. Hurt, confusion---these are all things you can have Harry react with.

#+begin_quote
  “Yeh don't understand, Harry! They're not safe ter be around! They're Hufflepuffs, Harry! They were followers of You-Know-Who! Let's be going before their parents come looking fer them!”
#+end_quote

I agree---how would Hagrid know what house they're in? Overall, not too bad. I think you need to chill on the adverbs, decide if you're doing third-person limited or omniscient and focus on showing through actions, reactions and dialog rather than telling.
