He was supposed to be making a reference to their parents being followers in particular. Recall that Hagrid doesn't exactly hide his thoughts well and he (canonically) doesn't trust the Malfoy family any more than the Weasleys do. There is nothing to suggest that he thinks that Draco Malfoy ever had a chance to be anything but a chip off the old block.

​

For that matter, do you think anyone didn't think Malfoy was going to be in Slytherin or Bill, Charlie, Percy, Fred and George, Ron, or Ginny were going to be in Gryffindor? We're not talking about a society that's particularly tolerant or disinclined to believe that children will be just like their parents.

​

Consider Ron: from a family portrayed as incredibly close to Dumbledore, they never give a moment's thought to the idea that Draco Malfoy will be anything but a miniature of his father. Likewise, everyone pretty much expected Ron to be a Muggle-lover. No one was surprised that Susan Bones was a Hufflepuff, just like her Aunt. Heck, the only person that came as something of a surprise in their whole cohort was Neville. And everyone had good reason to doubt with a few rare exceptions through Seventh Year.
