I see what you're saying. To me, it's about the image you project into the reader's head. If you just use adverbs for how things are said or done, you're missing an opportunity to paint a picture in the reader's imagination. Just saying "Harry said cheerfully" doesn't do much for the scene. But if you give him an action to perform, that's something the reader can "see".

What image comes to mind when you read about a child giving a cheerful wave? I imagine a tiny Harry in terrible clothes with a wide smile waving his fool hand off because he's just so happy and excited and wants Hagrid to meet his new friends. So yes, an adverb will get the basic job done, but who wants to be basic?
