  I would get rid of the “cheerfully”. Adverbs like this tell rather than show and you usually want to limit them. Think of how you can show the reader that Harry is cheerful. Maybe have him wave? “Oh! There's Hagrid!” Harry gave the large man a cheerful wave as he approached them, two ice cream cones in his huge hands.

How is the cheerful wave any different from using the adverb? Won't it make sense to just wave? Genuine question.
