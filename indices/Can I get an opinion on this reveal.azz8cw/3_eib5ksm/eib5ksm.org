How would Hagrid know that they are Huflepuffs without the sorting having taken place yet?

That said, I don't think Hagrid would be prejudiced against the two without a cause - and if he recognised their names, then it's likely that their parents had been Death Eaters. That's grounds to distrust them, as you'd distrust Malfoy.

Personally, my reaction would be "Oh... please not another "our parents and our house is riddled with scumbags, we never did anything against them, but we're unjustly persecuted, yes" story. I'm pretty sick of "the Slytherins are the real victims! How dare Harry assume all Slytherins are the same just because they never say anything against Draco when he throws slurs around and mocks Harry in public, and cheer him on on the pitch" stories. perhaps unfair, but I'm also not really interested in stories about Susan Bones and Hannah Abbot.
