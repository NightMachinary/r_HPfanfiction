See other comments regarding Hagrid's nominal tolerance for children of bad people.

But you seem to have made a leap here. Nothing here suggests that Hagrid was wrong. This isn't supposed to be taken as apologist and defending the Badgers. Hagrid has good reason to be terrified. Or at least concerned. Imagine if he had encountered Harry with Draco Malfoy and Harry had insisted he wanted to hang out with Draco . . . *and Lucius and Narcissa*. *Because he thought they were good people*.
