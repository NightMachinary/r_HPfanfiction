I myself feel like Hagrid is a very positive guy, and wouldn't really be all conniving, if Dumble asked him to keep Harry separated from others I feel it more natural for him to say something along the lines of "You aren't supposed to hang out with others yet... now come along Harry"...

then ether him dragging Harry away and the girls staying put,

or them following Harry and Hagrid noticeably uncomfortable at him failing Albus giving transparent hints from time to time that the girls should really stop bothering Harry, go find Hannas parents or whatever.
