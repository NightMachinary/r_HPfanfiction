I've never really read any HxC fics where the couple was endgame either, but only because I wasn't really looking for them. I just always found the couple weird since Harry was dating a girl whose boyfriend just died and how he was even friends with the guy to some extent. Though movie Cho was very pretty. I tend to like pairings with Harry and Luna or Hermione.
