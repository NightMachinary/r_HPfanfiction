To be fair, if you're going to skip one (and only one) book in the series, that's probably the one that you can gloss over the most without missing out on too much. The heavier symbolism and more philosophically deep themes don't really start to emerge until a couple more books in, some of the most important characters (such as Sirius, Remus, Lucius, etc.) haven't entered the story yet, and the movie adaptation is faithful enough that you can watch it and be up to speed before reading CoS.
