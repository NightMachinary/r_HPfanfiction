i live with my family. i'm from turkey and the cheapest i could find here is 200 turkish lira, about 50 usd. we aren't exactly wealthy, making about 40000 lira a year, so i have limit my spendings.

i found some pdf's online, but i don't want to pirate it. so i decided to wait until i had my own source of income to buy the books.
