This happened to me with the hunger games series. I was too cheap to buy the books and didn't think of going to a library so I read a fanfiction where someone had rewritten all of the books. I eventually watched the movies / read the actual books and it was the weirdest thing. Like reading a better fanfiction of a real shitty book.
