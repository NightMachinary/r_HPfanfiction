Me. I saw the movies,then read fanfics before getting a book. Though I did watch the Cinemasins and did wonder on about the inconsistencies. My first book was PoA and now I fully understand the whole Lumps, underage magic at the beginning along with the others inconsistencies or unexplained things in the movie.
