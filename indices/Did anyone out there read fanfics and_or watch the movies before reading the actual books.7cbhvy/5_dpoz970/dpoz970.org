When the sixth movie had first come out I had only read the first 4 books so I skipped number 5 to read 6 the night before the movie came out (a futile attempt I know, I only got through the first few chapters and was so confused about Lucius being in Azkaban). Eventually I finished 6 after I saw the movie and didn't end up reading 5 until after I had finished the book series and reread them again.
