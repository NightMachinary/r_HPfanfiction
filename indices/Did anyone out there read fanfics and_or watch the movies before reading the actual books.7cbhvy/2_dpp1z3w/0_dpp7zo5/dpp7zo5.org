Given that we see the first of the Hallows in PS / SS and the first Horcrux in CoS, I do agree that it's odd that the concepts aren't introduced until much later.

Although, to be fair, I'm not sure Dumbledore actually knew for sure that Voldemort had made Horcruxes yet when Harry gave him Tom's diary. He was probably starting to speculate about it, though. It's strange that he didn't tell Harry he had one of the Hallows.

If only Luna had been a year higher. She could have told Harry about the Deathly Hallows /much/ sooner.
