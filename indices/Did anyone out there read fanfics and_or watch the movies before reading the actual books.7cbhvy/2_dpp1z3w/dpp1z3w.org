- I read a fanfiction where the Deathly Hallows and Horcruxes were introduced a lot earlier (like, Harry's first year). Then I read canon and wondered why Dumbledore was not getting to the point sooner.
- Dynamics within non-Gryffindor houses being virtually non-existent in canon. Some fanfic authors like to fill the gap which set my expectations.
- I expected the righthand men of the villains would play a larger role and maybe there would be a bit more illustration of their backgrounds (e.g. Lucius and Bellatrix), while in canon it's basically all about Voldemort.
- Non-Harry POV being extremely limited in canon. It felt ... stoic compared to fanfics where authors tend to take more liberty. (I think the movies do it to some extent.)

I think influence to my misconceptions (or rather undue expectations) was mostly from Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. I like to think I was fairly good at separating out HPMoR-specific concepts while reading it, but it appears that some things sneaked into my mind.
