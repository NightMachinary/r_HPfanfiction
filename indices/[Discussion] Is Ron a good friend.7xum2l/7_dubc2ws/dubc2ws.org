Yes. Ron might not have come through for the little, stupid things, but the big things like life and death, like the chess and the chamber and spiders, he almost always came through for harry when it MATTERED MOST. :) So yes, he's an amazing loyal friend. Plus he and harry enjoyed spending time together playing exploding snap and quidditch! :) People I think focus too much on his negatives.
