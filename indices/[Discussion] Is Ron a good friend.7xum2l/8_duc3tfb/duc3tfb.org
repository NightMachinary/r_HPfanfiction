Ron is a good friend.\\
Definitely.

However, the Harry Potter series have as main thematic questions the effects of true love & the difference of how good and bad people deal with their flaws. Ron is indeed deeply flawed; sometimes he acts selfishly, sometimes he acts cowardly and sometimes he is envious and jealous. How does he deal with it? He realises he was wrong, apologises and tries to do better. Snape is shown to have similar flaws. How does he deal with them? He wallows in self-hate, he despises others and he is never wrong in his mind.

So yeah, Ron is easily a good friend.
