Ron is a much better friend to Harry than Harry is to Ron. It's far easier to find examples of Ron being there for Harry, having Harry's back, supporting Harry and so on, than it is to find examples of Harry doing the same for Ron.

I think people who complain about Ron often greatly identify with Harry, to the point where they instantly forgive or even ignore Harry's shortcomings or character flaws. In a way, this is a testimony to JKR's ability to write Harry as a reader-insert character.

Harry is the main character, and the one whose POV we follow throughout the series. We get to know how he thinks and feels, how he experiences the world. His characterisation, compared to just about every other character in the books, is pretty weak... he has just enough personality to avoid becoming a cardboard cutout, but just little enough personality that it's easy for most readers to identify with him.

And because Harry is a reader-stand-in, you do get to see how other people appear to him, but not so much how he appears to other people. So it's not always as apparent to the reader because we spend most of the books in his head, but Harry is INCREDIBLY self-centered. For the most part, he really only cares about himself and the things that directly affect him.

He's not mean, cold or unfeeling... he very easily feels sympathy or pity for others, he'll go through hell and back to help people in danger, and he's extremely forgiving. But he generally isn't very INTERESTED in other people, not even his best friends. He never takes the time to find out how they are doing, he never tries to find out anything about them, and he really has no interest in them as people. He also has a tendency to take people for granted, he gets peeved if they aren't considerate enough towards him and his feelings, but he hardly ever bothers to give them and their feelings the same consideration.

In his friendships with Ron and Hermione, he TAKES far more than he GIVES, and he doesn't seem to really get this. Partly because nobody ever really calls him out on it. His nastier moments (and boy does he have them!) are always glossed over and instantly forgiven. Harry never has to apologise to anyone, and he's hardly ever made to reflect on whether he may have behaved badly or inconsiderately.

I'm fairly certain that if the books had been from Ron's POV but everything else had been the exact same... people would have written tons of Power!Ron stories and had long rants about what a terrible friend and overal bad person Harry was.
