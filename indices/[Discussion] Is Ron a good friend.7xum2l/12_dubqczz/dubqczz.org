Well...I suppose Ron is a bit irresponsible; he doesn't really gravitate towards learning, he snaps at Malfoy a lot, he forgets to research Buckbeak's case, um...stuff like that, he does tend to be a laziness-inducing influence on Harry.

His worst points...well, he blew up at Hermione in third year (but he thought Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers after he warned her about it and she did nothing), and he got mad at Harry in fourth year (somewhat understandable jealousy, and it ended after three weeks when it was revealed how the supposedly-safe Tournament involved dragons), and he left Harry & Hermione in seventh year (but that was almost completely the influence of the horcrux)...and I suppose he was a bit doubtful about Harry's 'Draco's a Death Eater' theory in 6th year.

That's...about all the bad points I can think of regarding Ron. He's a bit lazy and his emotions can get the better of him, but aside from that, nothing. I guess that makes him a good friend by default.

As a side note, I think I remember there being a question about what would be different if there were no Weasleys in Harry Potter. I'll go see if I can find it.
