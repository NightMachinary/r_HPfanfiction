  Is Ron a good friend?
#+end_quote

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/44ougf/discussion_is_hermione_granger_actually_smart_or/czsc0po/][Yes, Ron is a good friend]].

  If Harry's first impression of Ron was Ron insulting/ being a bully to Hermione, would they have been friends?
#+end_quote

People always seem to forget a couple things about this.

1. Up until Halloween and the troll incident, /Harry disliked Hermione as much as Ron did/.

2. The thing that sent Hermione crying to that bathroom? She overheard Ron talking to Harry /not Ron yelling/telling her that stuff/, but merely a dude venting to his bro about the annoying girl who is smart but is incredibly irritating.
