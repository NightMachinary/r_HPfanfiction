tl;dr: No. He's barely even a friend. Certainly not a good one.

He's brave. Ron is almost the perfect Gryffindor. IMHO there should be a lot more Gryffindors like Ron or McClaggen, but they need to be the "good House" in the books.

He's not sacrificing himself (in a chess game, I don't think he thought he'd die) for a friend, but because that's what Heros do in that situation. For the glory and the fame and all that. That's also why he's jealous of Harry during the tournament or why he wants to be quidditch captain and a prefect. He's very superficial and single minded.

  4th book abandoned Harry in moment of need, but eventually came around I guess.

That's what called a "flag in the wind". Harry just did something amazing... Ron could hardly go on being the only Gryffindor who was still upset with Harry.

  and although swayed by the horcrux, still abandoned them but saved Harry.

Sure, that's just "author fiat" though, a narrative convenience. The author needed a way to bring Ron back without having a big fight and what's better than give him an opportunity to save Harry - even though the timing and whole situation is very ridiculous.

If HP were a crime novel I'd be wondering about the convenience of it all and Ron being somehow involved in Harry's almost drowning, but it's just bad writing instead.

I'm extremely concerned about people who claim that this is "realistic" and therefore okay. Yeah sure, it's probably realistic, but in real-life I wouldn't be friends with a guy like Ron either. Betrayal is a deal breaker and I have ended plenty of friendships/acquaintances for much less-serious events than turning their back on me during a deadly tournament or while being hunted by rapists and murderers and their insane Overlord. Doing the whole betrayal thing twice is just beyond the pale. Is it wrong to have standards? Harry embracing Ron again and again with alls his faults and flaws paints an interesting psychological angle (the abused lonely child, desperately looking for friends even when they don't deserve his attention), but I'm sure that wasn't JKRs intent. If you want me to like Ron there should have been a scene like: "Haha, Harry, did you really think I would betray my best friend *again* after the horrible thing I did during the tournament? That's silly, you're my best friend and we're in this together till the end!"

It's not like I want to hate Ron, he just rarely does the right thing after Book 2&3. Not to mention that I hold Ron responsible for Harry slacking off in school as much as he does. There's plenty of fanfics that explored the idea of Harry, the boy who was excited about learning magic and reading all his books before school, being friends with more studious people or just in general people who work for their goals instead of expecting to get them handed to them like Ron (why exactly is Ron a prefect?). JKR wanted to have her Hero win with Love, Friendship and Magic than with skill though.

In summary:

Ron is a horrible person and I'd want nothing to do with him. JKR did a bad thing by implying that it is more important to have many friends or falling in love than honoring principles and basic human decency. Ron could maybe change his ways, but it needs a wake up call and not this stupid coddling ("Oh, it's all okay now, it's behind us! It's not like you have some kind of deep seated flaws that need serious work! Just forget about it!"). It's the same bullshit that JKR pulled with Dumbledore and "everyone needs a chance to be redeemed". No consequences for terrible behaviour is not a good thing.
