  but is he evil?

That's just silly. Yes, of course he is evil: He tried to murder Dumbledore and almost killed some of his school mates in the process. That's pretty straight up evil. He also let a bunch of terrorists (murderers and rapists) in a school full of little children. He's also ultimately responsible for all the torture that Muggleborns had to suffer at the hands of the Carrows.

He's evil.

That he's too much of a coward and would rather let others do the dirty work doesn't really diminish his evilness. Pettigrew is also evil and doesn't get a pass for trying to save his own hide.

After the events in HBP Draco is pretty much irredeemable.
