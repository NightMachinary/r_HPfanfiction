"He tried to murder Dumbledore and almost killed some of his school mates in the process. That's pretty straight up evil. He also let a bunch of terrorists (murderers and rapists) in a school full of little children." Did Draco actually have any choice in the matter? He would have been evil if he did that 'on his own free will', but Voldemort would have killed his entire family if he didn't follow orders. And he didn't want that, did he? "He's also ultimately responsible for all the torture that Muggleborns had to suffer at the hands of the Carrows."

Ahem...no...Crabbe and Goyle actually enjoyed doing the 'torture', whereas Draco was forced to by Lord Voldemort, because otherwise his entire family would have been killed.

"He's evil."

In his defence, he didn't kill, torture, or control anyone on his own free will? Voldemort would have had his entire family killed if he didn't follow his orders. Your opinion is your own though, in the end, because I can't badger anyone to change.

"That he's too much of a coward and would rather let others do the dirty work doesn't really diminish his evilness. Pettigrew is also evil and doesn't get a pass for trying to save his own hide."

Just like Snape, he was one of the only Death Eaters that could feel love, but he ISN'T good, either.

"After the events in HBP Draco is pretty much irredeemable." ? Well, he did save Harry, Ron and Hermione in Malfoy Manor, as without him not identifying them, Harry would have been killed by Voldemort. In my previous post, I said he wasn't evil, but he was not good either.
