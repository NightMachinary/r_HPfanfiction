  In his defence, he didn't kill, torture, or control anyone on his own free will? Voldemort would have had his entire family killed if he didn't follow his orders.

I'm not going to give him or his parents credit for wasting years of opportunities to avoid this foreseeable outcome. You don't get to deliberately put yourself in a position where you'll have to choose between the life of your family or becoming a murderer and then expect pity. Same goes for Snape. It's not like they suddenly find themselves in their unfortunate positions through no fault of their own. Or in other words "Play stupid games, win stupid prizes". The Malfoys are elite Death Eaters, they know exactly what is involved in following Voldemort and I'm convinced Draco had many many more opportunities than Andromeda to move away from that lifestyle. But he was perfectly fine with killing all the Muggleborn, as long as he didn't have to get his own hands dirty.

  Just like Snape, he was one of the only Death Eaters that could feel love, but he ISN'T good, either.

Are your saying that only full blown psychopaths qualify as evil? I don't care if they loved someone, they are still evil fucks. Some of the worst atrocities have been done by people who deeply care and love their family and friends. If you can't feel love and have actual brain damage is actually a pretty good excuse not to be judged too harshly.

  Well, he did save Harry, Ron and Hermione in Malfoy Manor, as without him not identifying them, Harry would have been killed by Voldemort. In my previous post, I said he wasn't evil, but he was not good either.

Well yeah that's why I said irredeemable. It means that taking a 1 day vacation from your job as a terrorist isn't really going to be enough to make up for all the pain and misery. Imagine being this unhinged and leading someone like those AR-15 school shooters in a school full of children. Draco did that. With a bunch of Death Eaters, who are probably worse. It's only thanks to JKR that it didn't turn into a total massacre.
