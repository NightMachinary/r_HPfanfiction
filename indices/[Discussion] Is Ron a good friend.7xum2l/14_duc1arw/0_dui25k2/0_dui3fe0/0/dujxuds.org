I don't exactly think that Malfoy is just straight-up evil, at least not in the way Voldemort, Umbridge, Bellatrix, Fenrir Greyback, or even his father are. Yeah, he's a nasty, bigoted, manipulative brat, but is he evil? After all, he couldn't kill Dumbledore and saved Harry at the manor... he's kind of stuck in a grey area, where he's neither good nor evil, similarly to Professor Snape.
