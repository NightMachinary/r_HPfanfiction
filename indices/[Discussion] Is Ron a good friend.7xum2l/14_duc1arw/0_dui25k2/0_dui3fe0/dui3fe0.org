If I had to chose between those two, then of course Ron. Malfoy is outright evil and not just a shit friend. Also Ron has a good chance of becoming a better person if there's consequences to his actions, Malfoy not so much.

But there's enough alternatives around in Hogwarts who are probably better choices as friends than both, so... neither.
