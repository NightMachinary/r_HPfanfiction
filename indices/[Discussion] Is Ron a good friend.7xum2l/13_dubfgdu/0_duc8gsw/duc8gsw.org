I don't know... DOES he get easily jealous? I know everyone keeps saying jealousy is a major trait of Ron's, but... how often do we see him display it? When it comes to Harry, hardly ever.

Usually when Harry gets something really good, or his celebrity status gets him special privileges or makes sure he gets out of trouble, or he's shingled out in a positive way, Ron couldn't be more thrilled for him. He thinks it's SUPER-COOL that Harry gets an ultra-rare Invisibility Cloak, or becomes the youngest Seeker in a Century, or gets off scot-free from blowing up his aunt. Even when these things don't include Ron, or benefit him in any way -- even when Harry gets everything and Ron gets nothing, Ron is generally just thrilled for Harry.

The jealousy issue comes up exactly ONCE, and that's in GOF. And even there it seems to be less of a jealousy thing and more a sense of hurt that Harry might have sneaked his own name into the Goblet of Fire and didn't even think to include Ron. They'd talked about ways to try and fool the Goblet TOGETHER, so when it looked like Harry had just gone off without Ron, that was a slap in the face. Especially since for the last three years, Fate has seemed to conspire against Ron to make sure he's always excluded from everything important Harry does. Of course this isn't Harry's fault, but by now it has become such a consistent pattern that it's hard not to wonder... is Ron being excluded on PURPOSE?

Harry didn't really help matters by snapping at Ron, refusing to explain anything and call him stupid. During their fights, Harry is by far the nastier one... and yet, I notice that while Ron tries to apologise for his behaviour later on, Harry never even seems to consider that he has anything to apologise for.

I think Harry would be a much more trying friend than Ron.
