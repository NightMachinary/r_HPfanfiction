I think Ron is probably the "realest" friend Harry has, in a sense that he is someone I could picture being an actual person by the traits shown in the books. He becomes friends with Harry by chance. One wrong word, or if he had been in a foul mood, and his friendship with Harry wouldn't have become a thing. His shortcomings, in his personal character and in his friendships are very relateable. He has his own mind, his own problems, his own interests and reacts accordingly.

I think a lot of people hate Ron because he reminds them of their own shortcomings and weaknesses. None of us are perfect friends - and many of us want something like Harry and Ron have. Which is why his mistakes in this brotherhood irk us something fierce.
