  One wrong word, or if he had been in a foul mood, and his friendship with Harry wouldn't have become a thing.

Nah, they lived together. If you live with somebody and you're reasonably compatible, you'll inevitably end up as friends. Just because you have a bad first couple of encounters with somebody doesn't mean you won't eventually figure out that you like them. That's exactly what happened with Harry/Ron and Hermione.
