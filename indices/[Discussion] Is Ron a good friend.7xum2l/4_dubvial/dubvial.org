I think he's Harry's */best/* friend. People always talk about him abandoning Harry, and they're right, even though Ron was completely justified in both instances and was even the bigger man and apologized. But Ron has never directly went against Harry. Like the saying, "A friend (Hermione) will be there to bail you out of jail, but a best friend (Ron) will be in the next cell saying, 'Damn, that was fun!'" People often forget that while Ron may not always be /at/ Harry's side, there's never been a time he wasn't /on/ Harry's side. Think about the broomstick or the potions book.

And Ron has always put Harry first. Forget the chess game, since he did that to stop Voldemort, but look in the context of some of the smaller situations. He went into the Forbidden Forest knowing full well there were spiders, which he's deathly afraid of, for Harry's and Hermione's sake. He stood up to Sirius, saying if he wanted to kill Harry, he'd have to kill him first. And a big moment for me, is how he correlates Harry to family. The most apparent of these moments is with Harry's relationship with Ginny. With Dean, or Michael, or whoever, Ron treats them all with disdain and is pretty much against the thought of Ginny with any boy in general, but Harry's the exception and Ron doesn't make a fuss of it.

The point is, Ron has his flaws. He's overly emotional, prone to anger, foulmouthed, lazy, insensitive, insecure, and many other things, but he's still Harry's best friend, and with good reason. Is your best friend perfect? I doubt it, but they're still your best friend because you understand each other, have been through a lot together, and are always there one another when in need.
