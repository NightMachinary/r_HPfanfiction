My suggestion would be to have some sort of threadl where people could submit new fics to be added, then people could upvote or down vote the submitted fics and the ones that end up with a certain number of upvotes would then be added to the C2.

Or if you want to get really fancy run some sort of parser to see what the most frequently rec'd fics are and add those.
