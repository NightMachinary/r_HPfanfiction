Circular Reasoning by Swimdraconian because it is one of the gems of the fandom. Dark, brutal and still updating after a decade. Possibly the best opening chapter of any fic.

The First Day by littlebird0 because this is likely the best immediately post-DH fics there is.

Strangers at Drakesaugh because this the prominent fic in one of the best canon compliant post-Hogwarts universes (Northumbrian's).

Grow Young with Me by Taliesin19 because this is one of the few really good romance fics in the fandom.

The Skitterleap, The Forests of Valbone and/or By the Divining Light because enembee's work certainly deserves to be represented here. All of these fics are great in different ways.

Unatoned by SeriousScribble because along with Resurrexit, is one of the best written pieces of HP fanfiction.

The Shadow of Angmar by Steelbadger because how the hell is this not on there already.

I would have expected to see A Long Journey Home by Rakeesh, which I have heard is excellent.

I see most of these rec'd all the time on this sub.
