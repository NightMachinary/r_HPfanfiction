I thought it started well enough and ended terribly (like the author hadn't planned it properly and just picked an end - any end - out of thin air to get the thing finished). I can't really remember the middle. But every time I see it recommended I wonder if it's the same story I read. But then I think that about a lot of recs, and sadly I'm no one's target audience anyway. /rambles/
