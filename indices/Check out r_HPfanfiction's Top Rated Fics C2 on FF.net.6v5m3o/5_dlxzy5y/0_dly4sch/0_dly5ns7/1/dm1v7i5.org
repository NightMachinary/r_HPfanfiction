I actually have a soft spot for that fic and it's what I'd consider a good "starter" for newbies or anyone who wants to try something that isn't a shipfic. My standards for fic in general are lower than that of published fiction, so I'm not comparing them to, say, Woolf or Tolstoy or even King, but to other fics.

For HP fics, I'll consider something "decent" if it has a semi-fresh premise, a firm grasp on grammar, and passable writing. Tight plotting, unfortunately, is a bit rarer, so I'm more forgiving there unless it's especially bad.
