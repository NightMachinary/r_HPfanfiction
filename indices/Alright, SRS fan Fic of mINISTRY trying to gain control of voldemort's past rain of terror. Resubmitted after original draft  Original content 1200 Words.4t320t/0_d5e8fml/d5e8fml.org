Not much happens here-- the leader says "Wait," Voldemort walks in and kills everyone. And a lot of exposition! If you think about watching the 'movie in your head' it gives a sense of how much the reader is experiencing. FYI I'm a new writer and this caught my eye because I'm struggling with exposition glutting up my stories, trying to work on strategies!
