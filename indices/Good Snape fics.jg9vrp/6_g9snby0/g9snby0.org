I like the Redefining Life series by OliverSnape, starting with The Definition of Home. linkffn(5878880) also [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/14893][on AO3]].

It's not finished, but The Better Man by Laume also has a good Snape. Also features reasonable Dursleys and Dudley as a wizard. Not sure how you feel about showing James as a bully while in school, because that's canon and not bashing. linkffn(3570937)
