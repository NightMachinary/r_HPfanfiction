I did a little searching and came across this one. It has grammar/spelling errors (and in Chapter 5 I was really confused because the author kept saying 'couching' when she meant to put 'coughing'...) but if you can look past the errors its pretty funny and adorable. I laughed out loud more than once. I would definitely recommend reading it. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4823551/1/A-Girl-Called-Remus-Lupin]]
