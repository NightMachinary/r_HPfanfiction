  Your headcanon has centaurs having a bestiality fetish

The one thing Centaurs are infamous for is raping women. And while Umbridge is not attractive, rape can be about power as well and nothing says "We are superior" better than running a train on the witch who pushes all kinds of laws against you.

  All Umbridge needed to do was to toss either HP or HG at the giant, and watched as they were tragically killed by a rampaging giant.

Only the giant knew them and giants are supposedly magically resistant. Umbridge would end up smeared on the ground since obviously she is not a fighter. Or do you think the Centaur herd would have lasted 10 seconds against Bellatrix Lestrange?
