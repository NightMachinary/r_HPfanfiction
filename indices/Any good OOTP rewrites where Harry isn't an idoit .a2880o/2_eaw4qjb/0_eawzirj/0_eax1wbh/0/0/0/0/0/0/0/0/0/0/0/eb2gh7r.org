That is pure bullshit. 60 Rounds per minute is more than you get with a modern semi-automatic rifle, and this isn't a field battle situation where you shoot in the general vicinity and hope to hit something. The highest rates you will find for archers are 20/minute, and that was neither sustainable nor aimed.

Let the centaurs exhaust their ammunition reserves (30 arrows at most, so it's just two minutes) and then pick them off one by one. Or unleash Fiendfyre, which is at least to some extent homing and then raise her shield. Do the flame wall thing, which coincidentally should deal with most of the arrows.

Waiting out an enemy barrage before counterattacking has been a thing since the invention of Trench warfare, if not earlier.

They are in canon when Dumbledore and Voldemort battle in the Ministry and shards of glass are turned into projectiles.
