  You are forgetting that shield charms exist
#+end_quote

Let's assume for the sake of the argument that shield charms are effective against physical projectiles, and somehow envelopes the caster in protective magic instead of projecting the magic in the direction the caster is pointing their wand.

What then? While the shield charm is in place,she can't do anything else either - she can't attack them. And since she's on the defensive from the very beginning, she's going to get killed without even managing to take a single kill herself. Because the instant she drops her charm, she gets shot with a dozen arrows. An archer can shoot well over 60 shots per minute with enough training.

  But then Harry and Hermione would be safe from her and able to escape using Hagrid's brother to cover for them.

You're assuming Grawp will let them escape. Giants don't have the same cognitive capacities as humans. In the event of Umbridge banishing the duo at him and letting loose a series of banging noises and flashing lights from her wand, the giant is going to think he's under attack and lash out at whatever's within reach.
