  Centaurs raping women is what they are known for in the antiquity

Huh, TIL.

  I'm saying that someone magically capable would have no issues wiping the Centaurs out. Lestrange would just unleash Fiendfyre or throw around killing curses like they are going out of fashion. Hell, Harry and Hermione would trash them (vanish earth to create a foxhole, jump in, one person casts a shield or transfigures some kind of roof, the other curses them). We are talking about bowmen/mounted archers vs magical grenade launchers here. Rorkes Drift had worse odds for the British and yet they won the day with a smaller technological advantage. But Umbridge was taken without killing even a single Centaur.

And I'm saying you have no idea how fights work. Fighters don't think, 'Oh, okay, these centaurs are archers and I have the advantage because I have magic, so I dig myself a hole, and shoot out of it while shielding myself!' when they're faced with an ambush. They literally do the first thing that comes to mind, and this is universal with all fights, not just fantastical ones.

Bellatrix Lestrange, no matter how powerful, will not win against a herd of 30 archers all by herself, especially when surrounded. Even if she uses fanfic authors' favoured Fiendfyre or however many killing curses, she will get tagged, and there is every chance that any of those arrows can be fatal.

If you still insist on believing in her ability, ask yourself whether two soldiers, one with a flamethrower, and one with an assault rifle will escape out of a situation where they're surrounded by 30 archers, all with arrows nocked and ready to fire.

  A giant could easily catch her inside the forest since she can only escape on foot

I don't remember the exact specifics, but the reason why HP and HG were able to get away from the giant when they meet him for the first time with Hagrid was because the giant was restrained to the ground somehow. All Umbridge has to do is remain outside of the giant's reach, and she'd be fine.
