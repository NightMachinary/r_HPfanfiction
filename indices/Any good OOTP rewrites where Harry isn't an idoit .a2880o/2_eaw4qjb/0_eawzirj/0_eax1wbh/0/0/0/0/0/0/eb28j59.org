  The one thing Centaurs are infamous for is raping women

If this is something related to actual Roman or Greek polytheistic lore, then I'm afraid I don't know enough to comment on the matter.

  Only the giant knew them

Have you ever heard a proverb/saying that elephants don't know their own strength? Umbridge tossing either HP or HG at the giant, and the giant catching them will leave them crushed under the giant's strength. Umbridge wouldn't need to do anything at all, literally all she'd have to do is banish the two students towards the giant.

  Umbridge would end up smeared on the ground since obviously she is not a fighter
#+end_quote

And why would Umbridge have to fight a giant who's somehow restrained in a forest? She can toss the students at him, go back and tell the authorities that HP and HG led her to a giant in the forest, and come back with reinforcements which will kill the giant for her.

  Or do you think the Centaur herd would have lasted 10 seconds against Bellatrix Lestrange?

I'd assume so. 20 or 30 on 1 are excellent odds if you're among the 20, even if you don't have magic. Also, what does this have to do with your previous comments? I never mentioned BL anywhere.
