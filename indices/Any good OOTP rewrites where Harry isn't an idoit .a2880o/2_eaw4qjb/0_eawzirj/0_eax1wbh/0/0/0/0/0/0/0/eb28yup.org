Centaurs raping women is what they are known for in the antiquity. That's where this whole assumption comes from.

I'm saying that someone magically capable would have no issues wiping the Centaurs out. Lestrange would just unleash Fiendfyre or throw around killing curses like they are going out of fashion. Hell, Harry and Hermione would trash them (vanish earth to create a foxhole, jump in, one person casts a shield or transfigures some kind of roof, the other curses them). We are talking about bowmen/mounted archers vs magical grenade launchers here. Rorkes Drift had worse odds for the British and yet they won the day with a smaller technological advantage. But Umbridge was taken without killing even a single Centaur.

She is an incompetent fighter, that's why I don't see emerging victorious. A giant could easily catch her inside the forest since she can only escape on foot. And while the teenagers might end up injured by the giant due to the reasons you mentioned, there's no reason why he should attack them over Umbridge.
