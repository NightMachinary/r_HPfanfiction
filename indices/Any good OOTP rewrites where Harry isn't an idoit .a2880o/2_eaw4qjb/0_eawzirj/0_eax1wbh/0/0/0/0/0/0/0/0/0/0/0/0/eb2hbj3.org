  60 Rounds per minute

Sorry, my mistake. That should be around 20-30.

  Let the centaurs exhaust their ammunition reserves (30 arrows at most, so it's just two minutes) and then pick them off one by one.
#+end_quote

Now you're assuming that the centaurs will waste their arrows like imbeciles. Why should they do such a thing? When they see that their arrows aren't hitting the target, they'll stop firing, but keep their arrows trained on Bellatrix. She literally won't be able to do anything.

  Fiendfyre
#+end_quote

Again with the fanfic authors' favourite spell. You know, this is supposed to be a difficult spell to control. If Bellatrix does control it (which she probably can), it still takes time to manifest and do its thing. It isn't an instant kill spell. That small span of time is all the herd would need to dispatch her. The depiction of Crabbe's spell leads us to believe that it is slow enough that Ron and Crabbe are both able to run away from the spell as it forms and goes out of control.

  Do the flame wall thing, which coincidentally should deal with most of the arrows.
#+end_quote

What flame wall? Conjure a sphere of fire to protect her from arrows from all sides? Arrows are made of steel - they can pierce fire just fine.

And if this "flame wall" idea of yours is cursed fire hot enough to melt arrows instantly (like fiendfyre), then she might as well commit suicide. She'll get cooked within seconds. No human can survive conditions like that, magic or no magic.

  movie canon
#+end_quote

This is an oxymoron. The misty flying shit is supposed to be the movie's way of depicting apparition within combat or something similar. It's total BS.
