You... might have better luck searching for /Dramione/. There's tons and tons of threads out there in this sub with many recommendations. But, since I'm here anyways, I'll save you some of the trouble. My typical recs:

*Hogwarts/8th year:*

linkffn(Rebuilding by colubrina) linkao3(Clean by olivieblake)

*Post war:*

linkffn(The Die by colubrina) linkao3(As Certain Dark Things are To Be Loved by somuchcloser; The Politician's Wife by pir8fancier)

linkao3(Aurelian by bittyblueeyes)

*AUs:*

linkao3(Ride or Die by olivieblake; How To Win Friends and Influence People by olivieblake; Nightmares and Nocturnes by olivieblake) linkffn(The Wrong Strain by colubrina; The Green Girl by colubrina)

And, since we're here anyways, my own: linkao3(Don't Take This Sinner by hexmionegranger)
