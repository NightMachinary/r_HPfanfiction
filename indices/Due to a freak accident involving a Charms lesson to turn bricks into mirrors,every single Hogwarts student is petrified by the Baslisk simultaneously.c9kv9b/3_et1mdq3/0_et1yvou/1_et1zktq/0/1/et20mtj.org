But what would being half petrified or a quarter petrified actually mean? Are only their limbs petrified or they suddenly become paralysed from the leg down or something? Maybe their brain is petrified and they act like victims of the dementor's kiss? If it's the last one, then definitely being partially petrified is much worse than being wholly paralysed.
