*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13320880/1/Phoenix-Insurgent][Phoenix Insurgent (by BolshevikMuppet99)]]* features a well-intentioned, yet very grey Dumbledore playing the role of the protagonist. The fic's likely to become genuinely /dark/ at some point in the future, if BolshevikMuppet's previous works are any indication. It's very well-written, and Dumbledore actually feels like his canon self, despite being vastly more ruthless.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8303194/1/Magicks-of-the-Arcane][Magics of the Arcane (by Eilyfe)]]* isn't exactly Dumbledore-/centric/ - Harry's the protagonist - but Albus does play a very prominent role in it, being Harry's mentor. I consider it one of the best fics I've ever read.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5201703/1/By-the-Divining-Light][By the Divining Light (by enembee)]]* and its sequel, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5971274/1/Conlaodh-s-Song][Conlaodh's Song]] also have Dumbledore acting the role of Harry's mentor. The main focus of both fics is on exploring the magic system above all else, but interactions between Harry and Albus are very well executed.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13388022/1/Albus-and-Harry-s-World-Trip][Albus and Harry's World Trip (by ZebJeb)]]* isn't particularly well-written, but /is/ fun to read anyway. Mentor!Dumbledore, only much more light-hearted than the two fics mentioned before.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3169718/1/Chocolate-Frog-cards][Chocolate Frog Cards (by Bagge)]]* is a fun one-shot, if very short. *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12942462/1/The-Headmaster][The Headmaster (by Lizzy.fics)]]* falls in the same category. The former features a manipulative (yet good) Dumbledore, the latter attempts to explore canon Dumbledore's personality and his motivations is the context of Draco's assasination attempts in the Half-Blood Prince.
