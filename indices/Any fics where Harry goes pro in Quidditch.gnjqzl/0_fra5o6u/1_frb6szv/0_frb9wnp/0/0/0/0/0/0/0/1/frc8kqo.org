Limpieza De Sangre is the best fic I've done where Harry plays professional quidditch.

Joking aside, Qudditch World Cup, Vitam Paramus and Twelve Days all feature varying degrees or Professional Qudditch as a plot point. They are not connected and none of them are really 'about' quidditch.

I've also planned a 40,000ish word sequel to one of them that is currently 72000 words and should be published sometime between tomorrow and Christmas. However, literally no one on this reddit will like it. And the main character of it will probably give most of them nightmares.
