We've never seen each other naked. That's all I'm saying on the matter.

No, not all his stories have a pro Harry. Letters does eventually; Vitam Paramus does; Twelve Days does; The Quidditch World Cup does.

Pureblood Princess doesn't; Limpieza de Sangre doesn't and neither does the sequel, Cleansing the Sins of the Past; Ithaca doesn't.

None of the stories are directly related although some of the same OCs reappear. Titus Button is pretty constant throughout the stories, Jason Parker varies heavily as just two examples.
