Canon Dumbledore started looking for the Horcruxes after CoS (when Harry showed him the diary). After being "exiled" from the school in OotP, it became his main activity (since he was free from his other obligations). And in HBP, every one of his "trips" outside of the school was spent looking for them.

Even with all of this, he only managed to find . . . 2. Even by going all out and ignoring any secrecy, I doubt Dumbledore would be able to be any faster in his search, especially since Voldemort was the only one to truly know the locations of the Horcruxes.

Also, I just can't see Dumbledore overthrow the Ministry, no matter how badly they fuck up. The whole philosophy of the character is based on refusing to use his power, or take any position of authority for fear of repeating the error of his past. In my opinion, Dumbledore overthrowing the Ministry would be just like Batman taking a gun and killing people, it would go against everything the character is supposed to stand for.
