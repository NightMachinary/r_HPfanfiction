There's one fic - not going to identify it because it's a bit of a spoiler - where Harry finally catches up with Voldemort after taking a few levels in Hard As Nails, and is amused to discover that for all he liked dishing out the pain, Voldemort had no tolerance for it himself and cracked after three minutes of the Cruciatus.
