I don't think he could solve the Horcruxes in a day. Even a Dumbledore who know longer cared about playing by the Ministry's rules would probably fall for the ring horcrux's trap, and he'd need time to find out what they all were.

Pretty much everything else he could at least make a very good start on, if he wasn't afraid of overthrowing the Ministry (which is a regime which is complicit in outright slavery and genocide, has been for centuries, and is therefore entirely deserving of overthrow).
