I dont think Voldemort would ever have declared war against muggles.

I rather see that the next step after Britain would be trying to take over all the other magical nations and to increase his control over the various magical races(like he did with the Goblins).

Afterwards with pretty much all magical governments under his control, there would be no need to declare war upon muggles, if he for some reason wanted to take over, he could do that within hours simply with the use of the imperius, but I rather see him being content with ruling his own magical kingdom and simply taking whatever he wants from muggles, without actually revealing himself, like in the books where his followers were still doing to Muggles whatever they wanted, but still allowed it to be covered up.
