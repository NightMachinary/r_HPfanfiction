Harry is a hero bit not for those reasons. A hero means Harry had nobility and does it out of good, for betterment of society. This is not the case.

IMO I would classify Harry as a Tragic hero, his hamartia being his saving people nature. No I'm joking, he is a hero ignores emy attempts at being smart, I learned this from English Lit studying Macbeth.

However Voldemort would not have done that. I have a feeling he would have done something much more simpler.

He would have captured all magical governments and create one massive regime for magical. Imperious a lot of muggle higher ups in the government, change the value of Pounds/Euros/Dollors/Yen to 0 and therefore he would topple the economy and present a new government using knuts, sickle and gallons. Make muggles be slaves and work them for nothing while making food proces high for non magical.

While poor magicals, like the Weasleys get better wages and food isnt expensive.this would create a massive depression leading to a rebellion which would ultimately fail (See Pilgrimage of Grace)

Voldemort would be untouchable and life would continue like this until something major happens and life ceases to exist.

Congrats!
