Well, it depends on the situation (as all things in life). You're right that big changes will cause resistance - but in many cases, big changes get /demanded/, or kind of cause themselves to happen. But it depends on your aims, and your position.

For instance, Voldemort's aim (to take full control of Wizarding Britain) is one that doesn't need to be in the open. Instead, he can /easily/ control it from behind the scenes. So for him, keeping it covert is the way to go.

However, other changes simply cannot be done in the shadows. We can see that some of the bigger changes in societies are caused when it comes /out/ of the shadows - for instance, the changes to France during the Revolution were incredibly profound, both socially and structurally - and such changes under the ancien regime would have been very, very difficult to achieve due to how it was structured, and couldn't have been done in secret either.

If we're putting it into HP terms, changes like increased freedom/power/representation for magical creatures, house elf liberation, or removing pureblood power would all be changes that I'd consider to need more openness than Voldemort's - you're not going to be able to covertly change wizarding society to accept werewolves as equals anytime soon.

The bigger difference, in my view, is that once it's out in the public, it's hard to have /controlled/ change.
