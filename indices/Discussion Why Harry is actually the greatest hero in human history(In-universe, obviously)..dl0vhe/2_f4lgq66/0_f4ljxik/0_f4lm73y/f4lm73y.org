A student of history will generally tell you this about leadership:

"Big changes are always resisted by the population. If you have done things right, people won't be sure you have done anything at all."

The best way to show this in HP is look at Harry and Remus discussion in DH:

  "But surely people realize what's going on?"

  "The coup has been smooth and virtually silent," said Lupin.

  "The official version of Scrimgeour's murder is that he resigned; he has been replaced by Pius Thicknesse, who is under the Imperius Curse."

  "Why didn't Voldemort declare himself Minister of Magic?" asked Ron.

  Lupin laughed.

  "He doesn't need to, Ron. Effectively, he is the Minister, but why should he sit behind a desk at the Ministry? His puppet, Thicknesse, is taking care of everyday business, leaving Voldemort free to extend his power beyond the Ministry."

  "Naturally many people have deduced what has happened: There has been such a dramatic change in Ministry policy in the last few days, and many are whispering that Voldemort must be behind it. However, that is the point: They whisper. They daren't confide in each other, not knowing whom to trust; they are scared to speak out, in case their suspicions are true and their families are targeted. Yes, Voldemort is playing a very clever game. Declaring himself might have provoked open rebellion: Remaining masked has created confusion, uncertainty, and fear."

  "And this dramatic change in Ministry policy," said Harry, "involves warning the Wizarding world against me instead of Voldemort?"

  "That's certainly a part of it," said Lupin, "and it is a masterstroke. Now that Dumbledore is dead, you-- the Boy Who Lived, were sure to be the symbol and rallying point for any resistance to Voldemort. But by suggesting that you had a hand in the old hat's death, Voldemort has not only set a price upon your head, but sown doubt and fear amongst many who would have defended you."

Just coming out and declaring himself God-King of the UK would have united everyone against him, possibly even some of the more neutral elements of the wizarding world. The key to changing societies/cultures is to never be overt about it. Voldemort always tries to maintain the veneer of normalcy following the coup. Arguably, his greatest miscalculation was launching an outright assault with his forces that created a target for the people to unite around during the Battle of Hogwarts. This was a figurative shock to the people, compelling the fence-sitters to rally and fight against the aberration to their society.
