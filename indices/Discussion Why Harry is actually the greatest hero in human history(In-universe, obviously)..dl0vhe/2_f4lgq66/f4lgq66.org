I think you presume that Voldemort would have declared open war on the muggles. Why would he though? Better keep them ignorant, and realistically his ideology necessitates keeping them around to /some degree/.

Like many terrorist/authoritarian/governments, Voldemort needs an obvious other to point people outward and not inward. Muggleborns and squibs are a tiny, easily captured minority of the wizarding world. Voldemort would more likely keep the Muggles around (or prevent an absolute victory) so as to maintain the outward focus of his regime. Such methods have been employed countless times since time immemorial to justify the internal consolidation of power in states, and fits with Voldemort's modus operandi in the last three books.
