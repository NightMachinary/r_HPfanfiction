Those are a lot of assumptions there - for instance, that Voldemort would have been guaranteed to consolidate power in the Wizarding world at large (which is far larger than just wizarding britain), or that his power would be extreme enough to warrant that attack on the muggles even should he want to. Then, past that, we have no idea how such a war would go - and if a nuclear holocaust would even happen.

Basically it's a house of cards - it's easy enough to poke holes in at every point in time of your proposed timeline, enough of so that it'll heavily diminish your argument that Harry was the one great hero who stopped all of that basically single handedly.

Now, he likely is the greatest hero in Wizarding Britain's history - there'd have to be some major, major heroics in the past to somehow outdo him. But worldwide, Voldemort never really struck me as a threat. He doesn't have all /that/ many followers on a national scale, he couldn't win in a decade + the first time around, etc. Even if he were to become firmly in charge in Britain, that doesn't make it even all that likely that he could defeat even a small coalition of other Wizarding nations - if we go by canon, you'd expect there to essentially be a tailor made Western European coalition of France + the low countries + Italy + Iberia given who goes to Beauxbatons, and that /should/ be far larger than whatever Voldemort could muster from just Britain - even assuming he could send everything over.
