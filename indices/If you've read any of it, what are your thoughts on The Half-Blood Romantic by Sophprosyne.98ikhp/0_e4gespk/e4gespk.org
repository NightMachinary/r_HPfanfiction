Half-Blood Romantic is really the only fic in the fandom to do Harry/Fleur properly -- that is, it actually addresses the elephant in the room, Fleur's relationship with Bill, rather than just handwaving it away. I respect it for that and if anyone asked me to recommend a Harry/Fleur fic, it would be my go-to option.

Unfortunately, I remembered mid-way through reading it that I actually have no interest in romance. I like a light sprinkling of it as a component part of a general story, but as the central plotline? I get bored. The non-romance elements of Half-Blood Romantic just aren't substantial enough to keep me interested.
