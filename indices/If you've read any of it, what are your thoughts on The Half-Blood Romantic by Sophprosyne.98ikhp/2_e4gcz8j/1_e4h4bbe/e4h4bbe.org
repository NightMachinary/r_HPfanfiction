  Fleur comes across as a Mary Sue.

I actually disagree about this. I think that while reading you have to remember that even though it's not told in first person, this story is completely from Harry's point of view and he's falling in love with her. She's definitely not perfect: she's cheating on her fiance, she's extremely arrogant, she incorrectly assumes things about people and meddles and is then shown to be wrong, and when Harry starts learning more powerful spells she sometimes loses their battles. All of these things are character flaws or imperfections that the reader can notice, but Harry won't point out because he's either charmed by them, is willing to ignore them in his love, or actively wants them to continue, like with her cheating.

You need to look farther than her beauty and her talent because those are literally the base of her character. She's introduced as a part veela beauty who is the most talented witch at her school.
