  ut even the part where Harry has yet to develop feelings for her doesn't really pay attention to her flaws, or rather her flaws are inconsequential, like the typical Sue.

He definitely does pay more attention to her arrogance and assumptions about people in the earlier parts of the story. The first part of the story is him going to her and telling her that's she's wrong about the Weasleys and that's why they dislike her and he doesn't agree with what she says about Malfoy when they see him in Diagon Alley. Her actions have consequences for her, it's just not yet the kind of story where those consequences are physical. Her attitude makes people dislike her and she's already made decisions that are going to hurt her position in the war.

  And the cheating part doesn't really carry many consequences for Fleur since she doesn't get along with any Brit besides Harry.

That really has nothing to do with whether or not it she's a Mary Sue. And while her cheating, when it's found out, will have worse consequences for Harry than her, she will face consequences. The obvious is that she's going to be despised by the only people in Britain she knows and her reputation will likely be hit hard. Seeing as her entire reason for coming to Britain was because she wanted to escape what she felt was a bad reputation, I wouldn't say that that is inconsequential.

  That is considered a flaw nowadays?

It's an imperfection, which is a point against her being portrayed as a Mary Sue, which is why I mentioned it. She's reasonably talented and powerful, but people can get the better of her.
