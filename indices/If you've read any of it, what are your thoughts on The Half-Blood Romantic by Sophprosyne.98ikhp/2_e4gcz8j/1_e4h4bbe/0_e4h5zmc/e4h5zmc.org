I know that the narrator is biased, but even the part where Harry has yet to develop feelings for her doesn't really pay attention to her flaws, or rather her flaws are inconsequential, like the typical Sue. At no point do her flaws lead to real problems (at least for her). And the cheating part doesn't really carry many consequences for Fleur since she doesn't get along with any Brit besides Harry. If anything, Harry is affected badly by her flaws, but at the same time, the author ruined that effect by having the Ron/Hermione relationship which puts distance between them and Harry, who obviously has no interest in thrid-wheeling.

That is considered a flaw nowadays? You could compete against soldiers in marksmanship competitions and still score the occasional win. A skill disparity does not guarantee one outcome, it just makes it more likely.
