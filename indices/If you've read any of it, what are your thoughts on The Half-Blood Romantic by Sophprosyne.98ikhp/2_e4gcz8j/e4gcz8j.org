I'm not a fan of infidelity or open relationships as a theme (unless the bad guy gets cheated on). Yes, it happens in real life, but that doesn't mean that I want to read about it.

It was a unique concept and original plot, but as the "relationship" progressed further and further, I found it less and less appealing. Fleur comes across as a Mary Sue. Also, I hate slowburn fics and Half Blood romantic definitely falls into that category.
