But is that infidelity presented as a character flaw? I haven't read this one, but almost every romance fic like this presents it in a much more flattering light. I'm guessing that her cheating is highly romanticized.

May Sues can be awful people, but the key is that it's obvious the /author/ doesn't think they are.
