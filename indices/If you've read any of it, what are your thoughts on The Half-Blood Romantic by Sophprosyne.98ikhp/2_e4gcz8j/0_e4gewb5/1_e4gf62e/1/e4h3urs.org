  But is that infidelity presented as a character flaw?

No, but that's because we're reading from the point of view of the guy that's she's cheating with, who is aware that what they're doing is wrong. There's a reason the story takes a novel's length to get to any kind of explicit mention of their growing relationship.

Fleur has flaws in the story, which is actually something I think the author did well, but you have to acknowledge them yourself as the reader because Harry isn't really going to. The entire thing takes place completely from his point of view and he's falling in love with her and the more in love with her he gets the more he wants to ignore any mistakes she makes or any misgivings he has about anything they do, including things not directly related to romance that he knows he shouldn't do but does anyway.
