Harry noticing she's struggling with what she's feelings is not a negative or positive about her character. If Harry hadn't noticed that then I'd be willing to believe Taure's chosen outcome for this story, but since he did I doubt that dark ending will come to pass. Unless you're saying Harry's feelings for Fleur blinded him, and she's not struggling with anything and she is heartlessly leading him on. Is that your take?
