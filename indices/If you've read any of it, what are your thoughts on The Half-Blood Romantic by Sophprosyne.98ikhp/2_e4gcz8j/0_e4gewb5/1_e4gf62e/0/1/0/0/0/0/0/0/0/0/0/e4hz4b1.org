You are reading way too far into my comment. I agreed with what you said to [[/u/Taure]] and was responding to one particular thing you said.

1: You said "I'd believe this if Fleur was presented in a more negative light."

2: I was just pointing out that Fleur isn't going to be presented in a negative light in this story.

That's it.
