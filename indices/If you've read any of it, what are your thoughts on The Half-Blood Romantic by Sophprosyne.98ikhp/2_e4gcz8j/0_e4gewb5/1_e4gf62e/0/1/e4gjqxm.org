  it's very clearly presented as a very bad idea

At no point I got the impression that it was actually a bad idea. Yes, it would fuck with the Weasleys and probably mess up Harry's relationship with them, but I just don't see how it would hurt Fleur since her relationship with Bill feels dead, more like lip service on her part than any deeper feelings.

Harry and Bill would be hurt there, but Fleur could just shrug it off since she doesn't get along with most Weasleys either way and has few other ties in Britain.
