  Does is feel like the author wants us to judge the characters?
#+end_quote

Yes, we're supposed to be judging them for what they're doing. It's not overly critical, because this story is from the point of view of Harry and he eventually decides he loves her more than he cares about the consequences, but the story does not in any way try to portray their relationship as morally okay.

  Like, is there some convoluted reason why Fleur can't just leave Bill that's written in to keep the plot on track
#+end_quote

There are two reasons. Fleur loves Bill and doesn't want to leave him and Harry knows that if Fleur cheats on Bill with him that will hurt his relationship with the Weasleys. You also have to remember that this is a very slow story. It's something like 120k words, but they've kissed exactly once. Harry only admitted his feelings to her in the second to last current chapter. It's not actually at the point where she would leave Bill.
