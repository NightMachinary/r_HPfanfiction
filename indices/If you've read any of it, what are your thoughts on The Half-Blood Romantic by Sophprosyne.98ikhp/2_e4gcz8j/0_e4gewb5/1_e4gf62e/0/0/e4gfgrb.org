Well, negative consequences isn't really the same as something being presented as a flaw. Honestly, neither is the action being stated as wrong depending on presentation. I'm not sure if I'm getting this idea across properly.

Does is feel like the author wants us to judge the characters? Like, are Harry and Fleur supposed to be bad people for doing this, or are they just feeling guilty so as to make the romance even more dramatic and tragic?

There's a difference between a character saying "Oh darling, this is wrong but I just love you so much! Kiss me!" and saying "We're kind of assholes, aren't we?"

Like, is there some convoluted reason why Fleur can't just leave Bill that's written in to keep the plot on track (the "star crossed lovers separated by fate" route), or is Fleur just getting it on with Harry without leaving Bill as an act of unjustified selfishness?

I'm still not sure if I'm making what I'm trying to say clear.
