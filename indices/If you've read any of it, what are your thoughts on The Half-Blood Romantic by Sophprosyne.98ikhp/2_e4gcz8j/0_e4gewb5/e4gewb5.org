  Fleur comes across as a Mary Sue.
#+end_quote

To be fair, she's a Mary Sue in canon too - incredibly beautiful /and/ the most magically talented student in Beauxbatons. Which is why so many people like Harry paired with her - why settle for less than the best?

She's cheating on her fiance, so it's not like she doesn't have character flaws.
