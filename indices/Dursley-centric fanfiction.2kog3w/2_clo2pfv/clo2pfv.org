The best exploration of Dudley I've ever seen is a pair of fics by Harmonic Friction.

The first short fic is Harry centric, in the summer post-GoF, where he gets a glimpse of Dudley's life and friends:

Summary: This is Harry Potter. [This] is Harry Potter on drugs. Finished.

That fic has a much more substantial Dudley-centric sequel which overlaps a bit in events but then continues onwards:
