I am fairly certain your average Bright Wizard would ROFLstomp the entire HP universe. Let's not even get into the shenanigans a named character could get into. Harry being a Weird Boy would utterly break the HP universe at a level so fundemental that it would likely drive everyone mad.

So basically the story is going to be pretty short but Harry is definitely building his own broom (one that belches noxious fumes and has a very loud engine) and paints it red.
