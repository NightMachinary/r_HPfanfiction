Well, it's using material that everyone else in the class doesn't have access to, and (as well) taking credit for seemingly being a potions genius when those other instructions work better than the official ones.

I think if he'd found it from a source everyone had access to (the professor, textbooks, or even research in the library), Hermione would not have a problem with it (same with him actually deducing it himself). But instead, there's no real improvements in his understanding and he's just following different directions, and I can certainly see that as cheating to an extent.
