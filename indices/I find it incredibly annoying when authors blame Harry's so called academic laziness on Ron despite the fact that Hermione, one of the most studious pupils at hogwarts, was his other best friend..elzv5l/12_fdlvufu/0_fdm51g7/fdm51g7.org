Why would that matter? [[https://www.reddit.com/user/Chendii/][Chendii]] said it best:

"Yea I never understood how that was cheating. Potions seemed to be all about following the directions, he just had better directions.

Would only make sense if part of the class was learning how to improve the potions, but Snape obviously wasn't teaching that."

I'll add that I don't recall Slughorn doing any remedial work to fix Snape's shitty teaching so the 'why' and 'how' of potion making has no place in the Hogwart's curriculum. It /should,/ but it obviously doesn't.
