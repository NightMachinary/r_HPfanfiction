Yes. It's the Harmony/Hermione stans at work. Harry and Hermione can't /possibly/ be at fault, they're the main character and a /girl/! So the normal redheaded bloke that's nothing special gets all the blame. And hey, now /Harmony/ can happen and Harry can be a doormat and/or love god for the princess, the /goddess/ Hermione! ^{^{/s}}

Hermione wanted her friends to do well, but not /too/ well, as we can see from book 6. Ron was mostly chill about the book but Hermione threw a fucking fit because it 'was cheating' or whatever. Harry offered to let her borrow it, but she refused. Yet in book 7 she had no qualms using it when someone pointed out her earlier dislike of the book. "Things change," she said.

Given Hermione's OCDness towards learning, I'm not surprised Harry was 'lazy'.
