I've always felt like the fanon of Harry getting in trouble if he outperformed Dudley in school made a lot of sense. There are no indications of it in canon other than that's totally something the Dursleys would have done.

Even without that fanon implying that he was used to under performing by the time he reached Hogwarts, I wouldn't put the blame on anyone but the Dursleys. Ron is very laid back regarding his education in a lot of ways before fifth year. Taking things seriously after that was part of his character development. So given that for the first month of school Harry's only friend in his entire life is laid back about school and irritated with the engaged muggle raised know it all Hermione, why would he risk his friendship by moving out of his comfort zone?

On top of that he is seeing Snape, who automatically hated him and in Harry's eyes might be trying to kill him, tear apart Hermione for being an insufferable know it all and trying to answer questions. Why put in more work if it is going to be punished?

Then he's friends with Hermione, and he gets how important studying and knowing the answers is to her. Is it that far out of character to think that previously friendless Harry would be worried that he would upset his brilliant friend by upstaging her in class? There are indications that he felt that way when he was asked to teach the DA.

I think that at first, it was the Durselys fault for the way they raised Harry, and that later it just became habit.
