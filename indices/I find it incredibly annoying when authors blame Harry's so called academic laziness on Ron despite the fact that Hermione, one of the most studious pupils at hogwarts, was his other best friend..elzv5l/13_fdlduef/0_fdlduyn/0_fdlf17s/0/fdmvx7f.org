See, that's the argument I don't get. You make it sound as if there was nothing in the books which would justify disliking Ron and the fault lies entirely with the movies. But even going by the books there's plenty to dislike him for without going into crazy bashing theories. I mean, just look at his behaviour surrounding the Yule Ball.

He was an utter dick there and his accusations against Hermione were way out of line. He does not apologise for that, nor does he for constantly accusing Hermione and Crookshanks in book 3. Or look at how he spun Lavender along in HBP, despite having feelings for Hermione and realising months ago that they had vastly different goals for their relationship.

Now, I've seen many people do stupid things when it comes to relationships. I'm also the first to admit that I've done some mistakes. But I've never seen someone act like Ron, not in the most spectacular train wrecks, nor from the most inexperienced people.
