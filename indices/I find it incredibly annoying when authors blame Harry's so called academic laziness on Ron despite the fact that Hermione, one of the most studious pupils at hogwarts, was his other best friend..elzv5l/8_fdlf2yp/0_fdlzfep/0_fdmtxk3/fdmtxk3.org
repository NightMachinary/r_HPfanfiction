Re the Dursley thing.

I can't see them doing it deliberately but I can definitely see it being a byproduct of the environment.

They put him in a cupboard rather than a bedroom to keep him out of sight and out of mind, so I doubt leisure time would be something that Harry was allowed. I also doubt that they would have let him do his homework at the kitchen table or in the living room like a normal kid, let alone helping him if he didn't understand something. Harry's cupboard in the book doesn't appear to have a lightbulb or anything of the kind. Dudley is also enabled and even encouraged to bully Harry.

Ergo, Harry has to do his homework at odd times, in odd places, probably without the benefit of light and definitely without the benefit of adult help. His homework then has to run the gamut of Dudley, who would probably find it very funny to ruin it just to get Harry in trouble.

Obviously homework isn't everything, especially in primary school, but it might well prejudice teachers against him if he appears to be someone who perennially doesn't do his homework.
