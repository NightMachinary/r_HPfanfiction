Right - in canon, it doesn't appear to be the case that he's punished for better grades than Dudley. However, it's perfectly /believable/ that it would be in there, and would fit in with the general tone of their behavior (and Dudley's behavior).

I could see an angle where either Dudley is the one to bully Harry if he does better, or Petunia/Vernon for standing out/'cheating' (obviously there's no way Harry could legitimately do better than Dudley)
