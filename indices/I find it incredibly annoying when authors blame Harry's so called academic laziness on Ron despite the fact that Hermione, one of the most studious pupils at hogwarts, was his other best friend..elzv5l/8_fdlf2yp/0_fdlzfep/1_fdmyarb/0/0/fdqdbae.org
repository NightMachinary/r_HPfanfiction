True. But again, being the primary target of a prodigy mass-murderer would be pretty decent motivation for most people to find the time somewhere.

And where? In a castle where the vast majority of it is unused? Pick a classroom, do it outside, pick up books from the library, find a corner of the common room, etc. It's not like he needs a lot of space to pick up a book and wave a stick while yelling pseudo-latin at things and so long as he fires anything lethal at a wall there's nobody being harmed.
