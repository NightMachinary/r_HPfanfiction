Concerning your last point, I think it's important to point that Harry was always someone with an extreme amount of extra curricular activities :

- 1st year : Solving the whole mistery, with hours spent in the library looking for Nicolas Flamel, plus how to smuggle a baby dragon out of Hogwarts, and playing Quidditch.
- 2nd year : Chamber of Secrets mystery, plus quidditch.
- 3rd year : Defense against Dementors, plus leaving the ground of the school (ok this not is less important, but he did learn some importants things about the plot while going to Hogsmeade). And Quidditch
- 4th year : How not to die in a Tournament made to be challenging for talented student 3 years older
- 5th year : The running of an illegal Defense group plus lessons with Snape (and OWL, they kinda are important). And a little bit of Quidditch
- 6th year : The year where it seemed he had the most free time, though HBP says that NEWT level lessons are very challenging and he has to work a lot on it. Still Quidditch (even more so as the Captain), lessons with Dumbledore, the stalking of Malfoy, and the study of the HBP's book.

With all these activities eating up his free time, I don't think he would have all that much time to "train himself". And even if he could, where would he do it? He discovered the Room of Requirement in year 5 and used it for training in defense, and in HBP Malfoy was spending all his free time there, blocking other from entering.\\
Also, a lot of the things he did in his free time can already be considered as "training" (for book 3, 4, and 5 at least).
