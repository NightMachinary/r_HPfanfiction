Is the 'Ron is an obsessive Quidditch nut' thing fanon? Really? Damn, I totally have to make time to reread the books. I'm finding out I've overwritten so much canon with fanon over the years. I could've sworn I remembered something about Ron being all interested in the moves and tactics from the books. The Dursley thing I really wasn't sure about, but it's good to get confirmation it wasn't.

That is very much the same here. At my university, we'd get graded from the beginning up until the end of the word count and absolutely no more than that. You wrote a ten thousand word essay with a two thousand word introduction? Well, that introduction is all that's getting graded.

...because it's common sense and a pretty common reaction in reality? If you get mugged and know you're going to get mugged again and again, you go get self-defence lessons or prep a speed-dial option for emergency services or do something to try stop it happening again. I don't mean Dumbledore's reaction would be to train him, you're quite right on your point on his focus on Harry's human qualities, but Harry should probably have gone "Hey, this guy is trying to kill me, none of the adults are really being all that helpful, so I should probably gear up a bit and learn some stuff so I can handle that stuff better next time shit goes down with Voldemort without getting a basilisk fang in me or Hermione/Ron getting cursed." Especially if you add in the saving-people-thing undertone to everything where he'd be doubly motivated to learn so as to be able to prevent his friends and loved ones being hurt as much. It's just sensible to prep for bad situations you know are coming when no adults seem to be able to help.
