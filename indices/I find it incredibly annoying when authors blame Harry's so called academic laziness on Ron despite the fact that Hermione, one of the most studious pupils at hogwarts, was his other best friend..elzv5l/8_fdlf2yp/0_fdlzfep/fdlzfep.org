1) Ron had absolutely 0 influence on Harry concerning Quidditch. In fact, outside of some basic conversation (about their favourite team for example), Ron was not linked to Quidditch before year 5 when he himself joined the team. Before that, he would just say "good luck Harry" before a match and cheer for him. Harry joined the team by some turn of events (mainly caused by Malfoy), and then saw that he liked it.

2) Absolutely nothing in canon show that the Dursley forced Harry to have worse grade than Dursley. In fact, from what we saw, as long as Harry followed their rules (do the chores was asked you to do, and don't do anything strange like the M word), they were perfectly happy to ignore him. Even the rare case of violence we see (like Petunia "murder" pan swing") were always in the contexte of magic like Harry getting his letters or making Dudley think he cast a spell.

3) Harry and Ron are both good students. In fact, from their OWL results, we can see that they both have pretty much the same grades, with the exception of Harry being a bit better at Defense (an O rather than an E). Not wanting to spend 90% of his free time in the library is a normal comportment for any teenager, and it's rather Hermione the abnormality. And while we are at it, I don't know how it works in Britain (or in the magical world in this particular case), but in my country, a student systematicaly submiting a dissertation 2 times longer than asked would quickly get very bad grade until he learn how to synthetise.

4), Finally, and that just be a personnal opinion, but I don't understand all these people that think that Harry "should have prepared". He is a freaking kid opposed to a genius who has 50 more years of experience. No ammount of time passed in the library would level the field with a edge like that, and you would just end up with a completely dysfunctional Harry. Dumbledore never intented for Harry to duel Voldemort, he was more interested in his human qualities (love, compation . . .) because these were the things Voldemort didn't know about.
