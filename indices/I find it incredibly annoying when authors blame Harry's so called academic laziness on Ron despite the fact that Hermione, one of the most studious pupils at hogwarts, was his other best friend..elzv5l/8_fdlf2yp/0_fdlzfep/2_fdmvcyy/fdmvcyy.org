Against Voldemort, that would be pointless because he's completely outmatched. However, given what we see from the other death Eaters, there are not many who are decent fighters. Bellatrix and Snape were the only ones who won fights against the good guys, with Dolohov and Rookwood getting good shots in.

Think of it this way. A helmet won't stop an artillery shell. But it will protect your head from shrapnel, glancing shots and small calibres. So of course soldiers wear one. And for Harry, that helmet would have been training.

If the trio would have spent year six drilling lethal spells (eg Sectumsempra) rather than passing the idiot ball like a blunt, they could have fought their way through the snatchers. If the DA had gone through similar training, the Battle of Hogwarts would have been a one-sided slaughter because Voldemort's tactics were just "charge".
