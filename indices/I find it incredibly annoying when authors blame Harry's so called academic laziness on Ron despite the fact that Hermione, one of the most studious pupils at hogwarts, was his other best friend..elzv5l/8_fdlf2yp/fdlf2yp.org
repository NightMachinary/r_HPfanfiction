Eh. Yes and no. I agree with you wholly that it's primarily Harry's crappy actions/decisions that make for his lack of interest in learning anything about anything (it took him four bloody years to learn what a Death Eater was!) and that it was ultimately his responsibility for not bothering to actually prepare in any way for being an immigrant into a new society or being enemy number one of an apparent prodigy mass-murderer that everyone talks about as being ridiculously powerful and scary.

Ron being a bad academic influence is never really explicit, but it's sensible enough to be somewhat canonical. Regarding why he'd follow Ron and not Hermione, psychologically we follow the people we're most like or most want to be like. Harry is a dumb jock who likes Sports and being a Normal Kid^{TM,} which is basically what Ron is - a perfectly normal average Magical Quidditch Nut. So, yeah. Of course he'd follow Ron over Hermione when the latter is kinda pushy and slightly condescending on occasion. I'm not sure if the 'I was forced to do worse than Dudley because they beat me if I did better on tests' thing is canon or not - I'm rather tipsy atm and my memory isn't the best - but if it is that'd also push him more towards the athletic than the academic.

I mean, Voldemort should technically have a better effect on Harry's learning, given that he's supposedly coming after him and the people he cares about, which a self-sacrificing and passively-suicidal-ideation-having Harry would care about and do his best to stop. Sensibly, he'd learn everything he could so he'd have the best chance possible when Voldemort and Co came after him. Same with Umbridge, technically she boosted his learning by creating a situation in which he needed to teach others (which is one of the best ways to learn something).

Quirrel was shit, though.
