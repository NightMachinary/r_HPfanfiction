Well, I could see a case to be made that Harry /was/ kind of cheating by using it - or at least, making himself out to be a potions genius while just following some instructions. Same with it being an advantage the other students don't have access to - and particularly if they're meant to be using the official instruction materials (ie - class notes, the assigned books, etc), or at least vetted ones (if we extend it to include the library books). I would imagine she'd have no problems if Harry had dug it up out of the Library, for instance.

But Potions is a weird one, because from the books it really just seems to be the equivalent of a chemistry lab with basically no real theory/lectures behind it, so following instructions is all they do. And Harry just happens to have better instructions.
