I think that, if I had to voice the main shortcoming of Hermione, it would be her tendency to often think she knows best, and because of it, most of her actions depend of her personal opinion, and she is also really stuborn, having difficulty to admit she was wrong.

There are several instances in Canon where Hermione act on these, sometimes making her appear hypocrite :

- For example, she kept asking of Harry and Ron to be respectful when talking about a teacher, especially with Snape (because you respect the authority, and mastery I guess). And she kept this stance even with Lockart even though several evidences proved he was just bad. Yet, she also completely dismissed Trewalney and called Divination a fraud, because she didn't like the teacher. She also kept this opinion after Trewalney did a true prophcy (proving she had "the Sight").
- She also went to Mc Gonnagal, behind Harry back because "the broom could come from Black and be dangerous". While the broom truly came from Black, and she had good intentions, I think it's a bit hypocrite to do this considering all the "dangerous" thing she took part of in the past.
- There is also the case of Scabbers. She completely dismissed the possibility that her cat may have killed Scabbers, even though all evidence went in this direction. Even if, once again, she may have been right and Scabbers was alive, this is exactly the kind of behaviour you see from Karen when "Their little angel did nothing wrong"
- And just the year before, she dismissed the "official instruction" because she decided it was bad.
- And I don't talk about the whole SPEW where her heart might be in the right place. But when the Elfes themselves don't want to be free, you try to understand why they are happy like this, and try to find alternative, you don't sew clothes and hid them in the hope you will free them against their will.

I think the Hermione refuse to use the book because, the 1st time she was still a bit bitter about losing, and was later too stuborn to admit she was wrong (when Harry kept using the book and no potion exploded) and tried to prove a point about how she could be better while following "proper instructions" (failed on this though). If Harry had showed the book in difference circunstances (mainly not just after using it to win a little competition), she would probably have been more willing to use it.

PS : I also want to add that, while I think this is the main character flaw of Hermione, the narrative is really kind to her in most case. She was wrong about Lockart, but was petrified, and when she was back, he was already in the hospital and the subject never came back again. After Harry ignored her after the broom incident, she had a crying fit about the pression of all her classes and Buckhead, Harry apologized and the subject never came back again. Scabber was not only alive, but also a bad guy so even though she should have apologized because all evidences of that time pointed to it, it's Ron who has to apologize about daring to doubt her. Even in HBP, Harry does use a dangerous spell of the book, and she later show him a newspaper in the library showing that Snape is a Half Blood son of a "Prince" showing she was right again and the book was from a bad guy.Harry and Ron do mistake and have to apologize and grow up. Hermione does mistake and others have to apologize and grow up.
