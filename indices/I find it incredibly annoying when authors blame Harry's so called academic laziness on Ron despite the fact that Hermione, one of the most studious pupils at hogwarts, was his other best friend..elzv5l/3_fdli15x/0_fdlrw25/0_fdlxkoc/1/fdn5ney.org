I'm not sure if it /is/ hypocrisy from Hermione - doesn't make her opinion /right/, of course, but it seems to me that she considers anything outside the official instructions/instruction materials to be wrong to use there, so she doesn't use it.

If it were a hypocrisy angle, I would imagine something closer to Hermione being against the use of the instructions while it's only Harry benefiting, but being for it once he lets her see and use them.
