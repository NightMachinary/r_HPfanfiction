I mean /literally/ a princess, as in either the daughter of royalty or magically selected as the heiress to some position of power.

I don't remember seeing that one yet - the closest I recall is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3751748/1/Harry-Potter-and-Merlin-s-Reaper][a very good fic where, after Harry restores Prince William to the throne Voldemort usurped, the Prince and Hermione end up together]].
