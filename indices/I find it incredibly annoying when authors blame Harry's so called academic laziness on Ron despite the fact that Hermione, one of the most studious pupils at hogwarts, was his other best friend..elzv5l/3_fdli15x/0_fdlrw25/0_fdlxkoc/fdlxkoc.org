Pure hypocrisy from Hermione. Harry beat her at potion thanks to this book so it was cheating. She would have been way less opposed to Harry reading it if his cauldron had exploded the first time.

It's just one of her pesonal flaw that are completely ignored by most fanfic (as they were by the films) because Hermione is such a perfect character and the only woman worthy of Harry (funny how these same flaws are, in the case of Ron, proudly showed as a proof that he is a bad friend who don't deserve the friendship of the other 2, not to mention the love).
