It's "cheating" from the perspective that Harry has an advantage (access to better directions) that the other students don't.

Think of it like Draco getting private tutoring from Snape on the side (as in a lot of fanfics). Is it cheating? Not /really/, but it's certainly /unfair/ since Snape isn't offering the same assistance to anyone else.

Given that Hermione's achievements are mostly down to /working bloody hard at it/, it's understandable that she'd be miffed about suddenly being at a disadvantage. She's just struggling with the idea that /life is unfair/ like that. Sometimes people just have better opportunities than you do due to no fault of your own.
