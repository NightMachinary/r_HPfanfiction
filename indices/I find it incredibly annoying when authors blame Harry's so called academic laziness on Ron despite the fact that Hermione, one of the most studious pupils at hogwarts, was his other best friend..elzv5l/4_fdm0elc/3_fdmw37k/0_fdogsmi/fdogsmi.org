Sure, except Draco wasn't an Auror, he was a kid who was crying in the bathroom and got startled. And Bellatrix had spent over a decade in Azkaban, I doubt she was on top form either. But it's not about training. It's about capability, and I'm pointing out that although Augusta failed her Charms OWL, she's no useless idiot. And Ron got into NEWT level classes with all his important classes.
