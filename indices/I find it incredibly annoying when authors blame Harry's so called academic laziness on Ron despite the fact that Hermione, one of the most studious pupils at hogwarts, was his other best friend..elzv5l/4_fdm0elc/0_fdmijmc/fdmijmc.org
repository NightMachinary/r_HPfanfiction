  Why do people see Harry as this impressionable kid who is influenced by those around him?
#+end_quote

Because, to an extent, he was lol. Hagrid, the 1st person who was nice to him, tells him Slytherin is where all the evil people go. Ollivander tells him Voldemort was great. Chapters later, Harry looks at the Slytherin table and sees them all as ugly beasts or whatever he says. He then essentially runs from Slytherin and greatness. And up until 5th/6th year people who were nice to him got the benefit of the doubt.
