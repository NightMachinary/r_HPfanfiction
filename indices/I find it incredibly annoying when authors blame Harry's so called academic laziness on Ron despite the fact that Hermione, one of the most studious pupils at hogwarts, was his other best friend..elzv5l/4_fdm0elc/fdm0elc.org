Why do people see Harry as this impressionable kid who is influenced by those around him? The reason he was excited about books only to drop them is because at first, books were his only source of information. Then he had a whole castle to explore, ghosts to meet, and a friend with a lot of very interesting stories and information. Of course he didn't need books anymore. Plus, it was his first chance to actually be a normal kid. He'd never had that opportunity, because he lived in a fucking cupboard and was bullied. If he was influenced by Ron into playing games instead of studying, it's because he'd never had a friend to play games with. Studying is a pretty ordinary thing you can do on your own. A friend to play with is a novelty, of course he fucking wanted to do that.

I'd really like to see how many Ron bashers did better than him in school. Neither of their performances were subpar. Fucksake, Augusta Longbottom failed Charms, yet she's a formidable witch who put an Auror in the hospital. Ron got EE.
