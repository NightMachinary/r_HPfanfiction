It's actually news to me people blame Ron here. It's a bit like trying to make Harry a victim when they perceive something in him as a flaw. He can't possibly find a castle more interesting than the books. No way lol. And both Harry and Ron got good marks in their exams. Harry himself admits he isn't better than Ron in lessons. I wonder where everyone got this academic Harry.
