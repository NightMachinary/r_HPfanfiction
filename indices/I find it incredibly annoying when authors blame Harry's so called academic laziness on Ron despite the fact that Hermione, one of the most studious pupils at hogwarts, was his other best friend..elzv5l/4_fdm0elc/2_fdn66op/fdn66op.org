I mean, he is influenced by those around him - that's a given, we all are. That's not a bad thing, really.

Ron is a normal kid - and his influence on Harry /does/ bring Harry to play games instead of studying, or taking his studies completely seriously. Again, that's not a bad thing, and it's not really Ron's fault - but Ron /does/ encourage them to go off and blow off some steam, or to not study all the time. In a normal time, that'd be better and healthy, particularly for someone with Harry's background. However, in Harry's circumstances, he's thrown into enough terrible situations that studying can easily be seen to have been a better option by fanfic writers, and to point at Ron as a distracting influence.
