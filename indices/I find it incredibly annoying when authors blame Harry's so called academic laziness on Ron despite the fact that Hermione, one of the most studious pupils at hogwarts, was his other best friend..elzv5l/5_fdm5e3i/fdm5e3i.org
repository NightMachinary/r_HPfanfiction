specifically on Ron vs Harry, I ran across this a couple days ago

  I'm better at Quidditch, said the voice. But I'm not better at anything else.That was definitely true, Harry thought; he was no better than Ron in lessons.

But what about outside lessons? Is exactly Harry's next thought, and I while I prefer Harry having more skill and he most surely does in DADA, I find it interesting that if nothing else Harry sees himself as no better.

Finally, while I'm at it, we all know Lucius Malfoy's "beat you in every exam" in Borgin & Burkes regarding Hermione, but I don't know if I've /ever/ seen someone mention Draco's earlier quote

  He's not even that good, it's just because he's /famous/ ... â€˜... everyone thinks he's so /smart/, wonderful Potter with his /scar/ and his /broomstick/ --'

Everyone. Sounds a lot like Tom Riddle "poor but brilliant, parentless but so brave". And as I prefer to see it- Harry's smarts are put on the same level as his /fame/, /scar/, and /broom/ skills. ie. Quite considerable to say the least.
