Books 1/2/3 has Harry pouring over his books saying how interesting they are. Then they arrive at Hogwarts and all of a sudden Hermione is riding their asses for not doing enough.

IIRC wasn't he emulating her in book 4 when Ron dumped them after the goblet? He was beside her researching. When Ron came back, it was back to Hermione doing the researching.

Don't forget book 5, he really dived into it when the DA was involved.

  cheat in sixth year potions with the HBP book

That was not cheating, no matter how much Hermione says it was. The only legit concern she had about the book was the spells in it. Fanon says it best: Hermione was jealous Harry beat her in something that wasn't DADA.

I'm not 100% blaming Ron on this. I'm not saying he's blameless, but he is a factor of it. The rest is Snape, everybody's high expectations because of his parents, and Dumbledore not letting him have a proper childhood, and keeping his school in line.
