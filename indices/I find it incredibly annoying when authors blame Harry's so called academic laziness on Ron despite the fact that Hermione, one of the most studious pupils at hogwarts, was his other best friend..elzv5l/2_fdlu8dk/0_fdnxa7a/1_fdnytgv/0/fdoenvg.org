I always saw potions as a class with both theory and practical sessions, but that we only ever see practical (which isn't unusual, we don't see many theory lessons anywhere) - so from that, it's not just about following instructions, it's also about knowing why those are the instructions.

Of course I also think he took a risk - he had no idea if those were good suggestions to start with!
