  I always saw potions as a class with both theory and practical sessions, but that we only ever see practical (which isn't unusual, we don't see many theory lessons anywhere)

Except Snape has them brewing a potion /in the first class/. And while we don't /see/ many theory lessons it's stated quite clearly in the first book that, for Charms and Transfiguration at least, they go through a lot of theory before doing practical work.
