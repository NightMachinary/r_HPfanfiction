Hell, Ron had pretty much the same grades as Harry, with like a couple of differences.

It's not that he was lazy, some people learn better without needing to study, every person is different, when it comes to studying, and what comes to them.

Some people feel better cramming one or two nights, while others need to study pretty much every day, everyone's different.
