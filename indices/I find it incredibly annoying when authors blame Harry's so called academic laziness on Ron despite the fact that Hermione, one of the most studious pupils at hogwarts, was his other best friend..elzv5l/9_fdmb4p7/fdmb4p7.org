I've never understood why people thought that Harry and Ron were academically lazy. They're both shown to be at the very least average in all of their subjects. They always complete their homework, which no matter the subject, wizarding or not, is always a drag.

They're frequently seen with Hermione in the library. Sometimes they're not studying but researching whatever hair-brained scheme they've managed to get involved in this years expedition. But they still study. But Hermione's a bookworm and an overachiever - she's literally described as the brightest witch of HER AGE - the amount of time she spends in the library is not the average for others.

As with most things in life, the bad always shines through more than the good. Potions is a drag for 5 years because Snape is an asshole. That doesn't really reflect on Harry or Ron's academic prowess. And in spite of how awful a professor he is, Harry and Ron manage E's. The equivalent of an A. Divination is seen as a hoax and so they routinely make up their homework, when even Hermione comments about not wasting time on the subject.

DADA has such a flurry of good and bad teachers, the fact that Harry taught (!) the DA everything they needed to know and Ron received an E - like cmon - is hella impressive. Harry even compliments Ron a few times in classes for getting things pretty quickly. But despite the awful education they received, Harry probably alone manages to teach the entire DA 5th years well enough to pass the OWLs.

Receiving an O is really like getting 110/100. Harry only receives that in his best subject. Hermione doesn't even get one in DADA. An E is like 90-100/100. That's still top marks. Harry and Ron manage that for every core subject. Hagrid gets attacked in the middle of Astrology (which would be grounds for a resit in my book.) Harry has a Voldy-flash during HOM. And Divination, well... Rons scores are never confirmed - but its believed he received a P for HOM. They study hard for their OWLs. Rowling just doesn't spend two chapters talking about it. She takes probably a paragraph to describe revision that Easter.

Harry also always completes his summer work over the holidays (except when the Dursley's lock everything away). So it's not like he's unmotivated without Hermione nagging at him.

Countless teachers - other than Snape and Umbridge - talk about how bright Harry is. McGonnagall clearly believes Harry has the brains and the ability to become an auror. And he does make the cut. Snape has an unusually high standard for his NEWT class. He's the only teacher we see who requires an O. And that's probably because he's a jerk and wants to deal with as few students as possible. But I don't think McG goes around telling anyone that they have aptitude to achieve the right grades for Auror training. She sets Neville in line about the comments his grandmother made about transfiguration vs charms. And she knows his aptitude is for herbology.
