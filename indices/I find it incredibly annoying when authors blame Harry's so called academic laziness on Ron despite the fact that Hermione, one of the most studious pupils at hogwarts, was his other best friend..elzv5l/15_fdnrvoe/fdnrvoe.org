I'm beginning to think Rowling created a character who is an easy target for everything. Ron would be amused at the idea that he has so much power over Harry. Harry must have read those books Sirius and Remus gave in OOTP. This was because he found them interesting, and I don't recall Ron trying to stop him. Even before Hgwarts, when he read his new books, he didn't seem to try and memorise every single thing. He couldn't answer Snape's questions later, so I always thought he was as academic as he wanted to be.
