Why Hagrid? Cause he kept dropping adventure hooks?

Anyway, in canon, Harry isn't a bad student, he's an average one save for DADA from third year on. He's written that way to be more relatable - an ordinary guy put in extraordinary situations. Plus, if he were a highly academic genius, Hermione's importance to the trip would be diminished.
