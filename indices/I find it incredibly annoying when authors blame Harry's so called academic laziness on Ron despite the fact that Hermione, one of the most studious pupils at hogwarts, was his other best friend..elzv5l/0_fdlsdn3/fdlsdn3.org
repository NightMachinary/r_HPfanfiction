  Blame Voldemort, Umbridge or Quirrel.

Hagrid actually fits better than all of them.

Ron is blamed because he's what separates the Harry who read all his books in August and the Harry who didn't give a damn by October. The real reason is plot, but you can't write that in a story.

Harry's actions are entirely his own. That I agree with, but Hermione, while an excellent academic, is not someone that could inspire anyone to become more of an academic or a better student, especially not one looking to have /fun/. Having a meltdown and being ostracized due to being snappish because you're overworked, stressed, and exhausted is not inspirational.

Harry didn't have any good influences. The adults were simultaneously enabling and unhelpful and the fun friend wasn't an academic.
