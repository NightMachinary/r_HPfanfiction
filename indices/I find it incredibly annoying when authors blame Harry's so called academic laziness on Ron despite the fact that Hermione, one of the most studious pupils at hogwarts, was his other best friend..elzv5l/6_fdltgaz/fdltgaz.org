I always got the feeling that Molly was easily impressed due to years of dealing with the twins. However I must point out that in terms of studying Hermione would probably be a worse influence than Ron. I'm not talking about her giving homework help but the fact that she is very one way fits all, and Harry seems to be more a practical learner than solely a book learner like Hermione. If she had been interested in having practice duels, etc she may have influenced him to study more. Not to mention that studying visibly brought her a lot of stress sometimes- something the people around her likely did not find inspiring. Harry basically had no good role models for studying unless he were to think it would be fun to be as obsessive as Hermione. I actually think the most likely to inspire Harry would be Lupin ir Sirius, if not an older Weasley.
