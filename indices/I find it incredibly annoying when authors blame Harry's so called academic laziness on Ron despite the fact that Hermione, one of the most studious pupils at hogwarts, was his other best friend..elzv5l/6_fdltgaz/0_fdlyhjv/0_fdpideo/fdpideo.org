I feel like this is similar to cooking, if you are not aiming to be a master chef, just to be a normal cooker you only need to follow instructions to brew standardized potion. You don't really need to understand why spice A mix with spice B stewed on what fire gives this best smell, you just need to know that you mix A with B and put on fire for 20 minutes with this way of cutting. Any potion invention where you really need to understand “why” is probably beyond student level.
