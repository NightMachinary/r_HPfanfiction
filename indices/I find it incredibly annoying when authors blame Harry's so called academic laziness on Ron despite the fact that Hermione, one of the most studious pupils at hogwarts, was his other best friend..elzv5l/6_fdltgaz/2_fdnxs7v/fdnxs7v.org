I agree. He actually was glad he got the books from Sirius and Remus in OOTP because he knew they would be helpful in teaching others,i.e., he could use them in practice. Harry seems to turn to books only if there's something he is curious about, like with Flamel. He even wanted to learn the patronus charm because he could apply them. Hermione seems to be interested in everything. I haven't read fanfics where authors blame Ron for Harry's disinterest in academic things, but then maybe they actually want to turn Harry into Hermione.
