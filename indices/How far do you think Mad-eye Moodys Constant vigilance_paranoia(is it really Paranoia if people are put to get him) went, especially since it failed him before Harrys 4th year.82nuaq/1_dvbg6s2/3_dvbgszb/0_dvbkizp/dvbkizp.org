That failsafe sounds very convoluted. In what situation outside of 'being kidnapped and polyjuiced by a Death Eater, who then meets Dumbledore as me' is that a useful precaution to have?

EDIT: Just read the second part: the simplest way to avoid being impersonated is a series of code phrases exchanged between Moody and Dumbledore at the start of a conversation to confirm the other's identity. So long as both Moody and Dumbledore can use occlumency this works out easiest.
