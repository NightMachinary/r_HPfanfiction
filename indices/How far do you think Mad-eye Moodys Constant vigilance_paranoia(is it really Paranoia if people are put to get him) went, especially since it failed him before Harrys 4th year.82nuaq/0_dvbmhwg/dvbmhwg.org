My head cannon on four year was always bothered by how fake Moody would not get noticed. My process was that Dumbledore was just asking Moody to help, and the teaching was really useful because it came from him.

Sure the attempt was made to get him, but it wasn't until task 3 where he was actually replaced.

Otherwise that implied only two wizards attacked Moody and won, replaced him and then got away with pretending to be him for a year.

I'm not saying it isn't possible just always felt like alot of damn trouble to be teaching all those classes for some mad Crouch Jr. And holding up his cover. And having enough Polyjuice to teach classes all day long for a school year. And having time to bewitch the cup.

Made more sense that Moody was paranoid all year because Crouch was looking to take him out and it takes a whole year for it to work after the first attempt before the school year.

...

I think if I take cannon at face value Moody is paranoid to the highest, but in practice has not really protected himself. He was taken out by Pettigrew and Crouch Jr. right? That's it?

Just rat man who is a coward, and a crazy guy?

Moody you are incompetent.
