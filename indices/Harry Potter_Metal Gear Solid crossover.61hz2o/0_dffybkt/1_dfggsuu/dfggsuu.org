I can see Lupin-SIGINT(Donald Anderson). He was discriminated against, extremely knowledgeable in defensive equipment (weapons/DADA), and doesn't ever do anything useful.

I can sorta see Sirius-Drebin 893. Kind of a goofy guy, likes animals especially rare/extinct ones (buckbeak?). Has ethics unlike the majority of his fellows, and a rocky relationship with his leaders (Patriots) A stretch, but oh well.

I'm at a lost for Ron, I'm going to just say Fatman for him. Because it amuses me.
