Interesting idea. Would have thought that Master Miller would have been a more appropriate Moody analogue personally. Trying to think of some other character crossovers:

Snape - Ocelot: triple agent, no one quite sure of his motives until the very end. Weird relationship with the protagonist.

Lucius - Sniper Wolf: Of very little use outside of being sexy.

Tonks - Decoy Octopus: Surely self-explanatory

Dumbledore - Campbell: Mentor of the protagonist; keeps the protagonist in the dark about what is /actually/ going on behind the scenes until the very end.

Some very, very loose ones:

Hermione - Otacon: Nerdy support to the protagonist; not really made for war but sticks it out until the bitter end nonetheless.

Harry's horcrux - Grey Fox: Speaks to all the weird "I'm a prisoner of death" stuff... I dunno.

Malfoy - whoever the shittest boss is: self-explanatory. Actually maybe he can be Johnny Sasaki [I was tempted to say Raiden for Malfoy but while Raiden is almost universally hated, a lot of people love Malfoy for some reason].

Trelawney - Psycho Mantis: They're both weird and take you by surprise at first but are ultimately easy to brush aside. Both have vague premonitions of the future and delusions of grandeur.

Ginny - Meryl: I guess? Starts off as a fangirl, becomes harder, then the protagonist realises he's attracted to her. I doubt I would have made this connection if they weren't both red-heads.

A few for whom I can't find direct analogues: - Ron - Sirius - Lupin
