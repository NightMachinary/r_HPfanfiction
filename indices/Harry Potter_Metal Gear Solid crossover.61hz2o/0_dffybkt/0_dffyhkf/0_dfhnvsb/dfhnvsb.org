A possibly amusing note for you: the reason the plot of the games is so confounding is because after every MGS game the person behind it wanted out but wasn't allowed to and made the games' plots weirder and weirder so that they'd at some point say “no, this is just too nonsensical, we pull you out of this project” but it never actually happened.
