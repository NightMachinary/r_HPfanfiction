It seemed to work out well for me, but I also have been doing this for much longer than your average Redditor. I know more of these terms, so it seems that the only thing to mention is reinforcing the idea that you should make sure that people who don't write it can choose that without problems like VulpineKitsune said. Also, that's a dope name.
