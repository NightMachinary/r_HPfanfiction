Mary Sue fanfiction has been a part of fandom and fanworks since its origins in the Star Trek fan community. Beyond that, Mary Sue fanfic is commonly associated with self-insertion and wish fulfillment. While I acknowledge that authors are generally more transparent about self-inserts, I chose to group the two together due to their association.
