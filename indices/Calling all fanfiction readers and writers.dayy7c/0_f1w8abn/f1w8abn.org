If you select that you only read fanfiction on the first page it takes you to a section for "readers and writers" with required questions about writing habits.

If this is supposed to be fandom agnostic, you're also missing some major sites for where people read or publish fanfiction. E.g. in the Worm fandom the vast majority of fic is on the Space Battles / Sufficient Velocy / Questionable Questing forums. There should probably at least be an "other" option.
