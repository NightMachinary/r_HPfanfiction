  Is the fic still good if I have zero experience with creepypasta and/or apparently the game Slender?

It's sort of a gray area. They don't go into the character backstories much, and most references are explained as this Harry doesn't know about creepypasta either at first. However, there are things that hit better if you know the stories, i.e. Toby mentioning Lyra in one of the first chapters, why no one told Ben the second task took place underwater, Jeff and his relationship with Liu, Puppeteer being called Jonothan as a cover name, ect.

  Also it's tagged Horror, on a scale from 1 to 10 how intense is it?

Depends if you're okay with mild-to-moderate gore and such. It doesn't go into the actual killing a lot but there's small scenes of the Creepypastas in the beginning and end of each Hogwarts chapter, which isn't a lot overall, and there are a few scenes with Isaac killing someone. There's also an entire chapter that has a lot of death but is absolutely stuffed full of Chicago Musical references from the Cell Block Tango. So it can get a bit much, but it's not much overall, and the bad scenes are easily skippable.
