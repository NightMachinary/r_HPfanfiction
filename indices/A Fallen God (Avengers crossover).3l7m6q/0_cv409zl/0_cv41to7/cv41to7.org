Well, as they say, practice makes perfect. And if that gives me more to read, who am I to complain?

Otherwise, I think you have to watch out on making Harry too strong. Maybe show areas where he is relatively week. Maybe potions and transfiguration? Maybe have Moody's eye see through all of Harry's illusions.

Also, I hope you show how Voldemort (or his agent) got ahold of pre-Loki blood to bind Harry into the tournament.
