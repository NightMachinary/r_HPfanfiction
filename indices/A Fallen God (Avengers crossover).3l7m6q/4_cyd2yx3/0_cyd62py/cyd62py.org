I completely agree, to be honest. Looking back, there's a hell of a lot I would change.

If it helps, the "power levels" only apply to Asgardian and Jotun magic rather than HP magic, which Harry uses the large majority of the time, so it rarely comes up.

I'm not sure whether I ever improved at the "show don't tell." Probably, but not very much.

There are also quite a few random and "convenient" plot points which I feel detract from the story and make it pretty bad.

Anyway, thanks for your feedback.

And no, I wasn't stalking this thread every hour. I just randomly searched for it to see if anyone had commented.
