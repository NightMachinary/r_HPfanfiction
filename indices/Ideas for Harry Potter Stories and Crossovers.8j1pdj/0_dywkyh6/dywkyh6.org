A rather cracky Mass Effect crossover where fem!Shep, Liara and Tali get sucked out of the Mass Effect 2 universe and end up crash-landing their shuttle in Privet Drive Number 4's backyard on November 2nd, 1981 (due to the wards, no one notices). While checking the area, Jane finds Harry in front of a door, suffering from hypothermia, and take him to the shuttle, which Tali is busy repairing. They patch Harry up and are surprised when a medical scanner shows that the baby has been exposed to Element Zero.

Since this is clearly not just the past but an alternate universe, they decide to keep Harry for the foreseable future, especially considering how they found him. Tali fixes the shuttle and the trio decides to head to the Mars, to dig up the Prothean Archive there. While Tali tries to build an FTL drive for the shuttle and Liara does her science thing, Jane is stuck with raising Harry (and no one in the group knows much about motherhood or raising humans). Liara eventually gives him some biotic lessons, although Harry keeps coming up with his own techniques (since magic is not just biotics).

Fast forward a couple years and they find an owl sitting on their shuttle, ignoring the lack of oxygen to deliver the Hogwarts letter, which is even adressed with "Shuttle 03, Prothean Archives, Mars" or something similar. So after using the shuttle sensors to find Diagon Alley (element Zero concentration in London), Shepard takes Harry shopping and they get some books to get a basic understanding of the magical world. At Hogwarts, Harry tells everyone that he has been raised by two aliens on Mars but most students just think it is either a joke or an additional layer of security, while a few believe it since "it's Harry Potter".

Not sure where the main plot here would go, but Voldemort, Snape and Malfoy are sure in for a bad time.
