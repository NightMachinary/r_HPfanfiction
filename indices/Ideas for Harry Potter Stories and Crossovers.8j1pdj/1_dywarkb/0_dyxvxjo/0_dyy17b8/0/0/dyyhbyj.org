Nah, it's in the same universe as his own, and his depression isn't about anything romance related (he didn't get back with Ginny after HBP and he's in a relationship that works for him). His situation is more about trying to find out what he wants to do with his life now that it's not prophesied what will happen now; feels a bit aimless. Although that bit about SHIELD freaking out because he's practically a ghost is really neat, I might just use it. xD
