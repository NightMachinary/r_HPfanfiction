Harry is depressed, because he got dumped in a different universe from his, but covers it by being a world traveller. Because he vacations in non-vacation spots (war zones) with no paper trail or support, SHIELD freaks out. They freak out more because he becomes Besties with Tony Stark. They track him, he plays counterspy, he joins the Avengers and the plot goes haywire. It ends just as things get Asgardian.

He is paired with Natasha, but really wants Ginny.
