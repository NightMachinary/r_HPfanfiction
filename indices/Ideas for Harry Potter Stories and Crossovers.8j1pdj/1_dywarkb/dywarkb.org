I've got an HP/Avengers (MCU) crossover in the works, but it's not ready yet, maybe in a month or two. Thought it might be cool to see a Harry who's somewhat lost after the second war and has some exploration of foreign magic and the obligations some other wizards have, as he searched for meaning since his life was basically "Beat Voldemort or Bust". Beforehand his conception of a post-Voldemort life came across as "Um, Auror I guess" which is just enough leeway for me. Hermione is pretty useful for this, keeps him grounded and focused.

Having to rewrite some of the mechanics of magic so the magic systems don't contradict was a bit of a pain, but it's been pretty fun as well. Also Wizards vs Aliens is just silly enough that I chuckle at the thought.
