Yeah an interesting thing from the annual surveys shows that Umbridge is by far the most commonly least favourite character despite Voldemort being far more destructive and various other characters being much more stereotypically evil. Maybe it's just that people have encountered that sort of malicious behaviour from authority figures which they've felt powerless to do anything against, whereas relatively few can relate to the whole murdered parents and war-torn society thingy.
