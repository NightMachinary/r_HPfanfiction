"James Charlus Potter may have been my father in another dimension, but I will not be ordered about like a small child. And if you ever insult Severus in my presence again I'll reap your soul where you stand"

Got about this far, don't really know why I bothered to read it after the first few paragraphs. I suppose being absolutely pathetically edgy isn't quite the same as evil. Though following through and murdering someone for a literal insult alone would be both absolutely evil, not to mention the most child-like tantrum that's possible to throw.
