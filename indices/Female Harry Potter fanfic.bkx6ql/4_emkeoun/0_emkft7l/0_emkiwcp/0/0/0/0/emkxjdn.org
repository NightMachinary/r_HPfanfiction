Yes. Welcome to the postmodern world of confused authority. Subjective canon is an oxymoron, or it means “what I do consider canon”. If you don't accept JKR as a pope (and I know I am not alone in rejecting CC), then you are suddenly in the confusing world of wide freedom and you have to decide what's your authority.

Do you accept CC? Pottermore (whole or parts of it)? Films? HP: Hogwarts Mystery? HP video games? Lego Harry Potter? JKR interviews? Is there Penny Haywood in your world? You have to decide.
