Well, that's the point ... she has never been named in the books or in the films, and actually aside from the Ron's claim Scorpius is a pureblood (and who believes Ron to be perfectly accurate especially with regards to Malfoys?), there isn't even evidence she is a witch or that Daphne had a sister (which helps my reading of linkffn(3912184;4236594)). That's all Pottermore and the accursed Cursed Child (and the latter is certainly NOT a part of my canon). Came upon this while reading linkffn(Exile by bennybear), which I highly recommend for reading, BTW.
