The idea of partial metamorphs are fanon, the only one we meet is Tonks and there's never any mention of partial metamorphs in canon. There's also no animals (or partial animal) morphing, what Tonks does with the pig snouts and duck bills are just changing the shape and color (maybe texture as well) of her facial features to mimic an animal's. Also, there's no mention of gender swapping, however Tonks is able to disguise herself as a male guard in one of the books I think. It makes sense, since even if there's no gender swapping traits women have the potential to grow facial hair, so she's be able to make that grow out, and change her facial and body features to be more masculine.
