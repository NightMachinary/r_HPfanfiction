I mean, it's fanfic, nobody really cares if you switch it up a bit (well, some might, but it's practically impossible to read through a fanfic without coming across wards, rune stones, magical cores, Lords, or any number of other fanon/tropes). At the very least this doesn't contradict canon, it's just never stated within canon. I would recommend at least making use of those abilities in the plot rather than just using them to make a quirky OC character or something.
