Not so sure about your premise but that's a good question ðŸ¤” I've never seen any Hagrid fics or heard people talk about them... I guess although many people like Hagrid he is not someone most people would ship with someone else, so that might be a reason for fewer stories. He's also generally a happy person and I think a lot of people like to improve their fav characters lives... with Hagrid I'm not even sure if he would change much for himself if he could go to the past so there also isn't quite as much plot material to write about him ðŸ¤”
