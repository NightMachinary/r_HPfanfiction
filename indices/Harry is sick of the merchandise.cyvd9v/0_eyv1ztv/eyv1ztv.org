Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor) has a scene where Harry visits Godric's Hollow, only to find that his parents' home has become an amusement park ride where people pay to ride through the house, and the murder of James and Lily is replayed with animatronics. There's also a gift shop at the end.

The fic is obviously pretty crack-ish and pretty smutty, but I find it to be hilarious personally.
