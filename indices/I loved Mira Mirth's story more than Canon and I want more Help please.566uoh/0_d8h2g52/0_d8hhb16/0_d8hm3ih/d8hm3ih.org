If you're able to enjoy non-Harry-centric fics, then you definitely should check out linkffn(The Changeling by Annerb; Applied Cultural Anthropology, or). They are very well-written, well-characterized AU Slytherin fics, featuring Ginny and Hermione respectively, and are generally considered as must-reads on this subreddit. I normally tend to read Harry-centric stories, but that didn't stop me from really appreciating these quality works.

Here are a few excellent Harry-centric stories featuring canonical divergences, good development, and a more active, competent Harry: linkffn(The One He Feared; Harry Potter and the Forests of ValbonÃ«; Dagger and Rose; Harry Potter and the Unlocked Knowledge; What Lies Beneath)

Also, here are some Harry-centric AU fics that you may enjoy: linkffn(The Skitterleap; By the Divining Light; What You Leave Behind; The Other Side of the Coin)
