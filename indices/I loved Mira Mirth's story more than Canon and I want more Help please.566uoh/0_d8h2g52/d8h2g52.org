linkffn(Forging the Sword)

One of the greatest examples of realistic character development, characterization, and trio interaction I've seen in the fandom. This story is, tied with On the Way to Greatness, is my all-time favorite fanfiction.

The point of divergence is in the Chamber of Secrets, where [[/spoiler][Harry has to choose to kill Ginny in order to destroy Tom Riddle's Diary]]. From that single point of AU, the canon plot and main characters gradually and subtly changes, with some truly excellent exploration of magic and character/magical growth.
