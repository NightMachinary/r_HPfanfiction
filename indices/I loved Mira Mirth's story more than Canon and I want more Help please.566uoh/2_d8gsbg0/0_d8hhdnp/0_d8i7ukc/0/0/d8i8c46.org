Doesn't excuse the reason for rushing to the DoM being to rescue fucking Lucius. You know the DEATH EATER THAT WAS AT THE GRAVEYARD. Like what the fuck, he even says later that Lucius was like a father to him? But he still participated in the ressurection ritual? Not fatherly behavior at all son.

The story was tolerable up until DoM. But that whole thing was a debacle, writing-wise.
