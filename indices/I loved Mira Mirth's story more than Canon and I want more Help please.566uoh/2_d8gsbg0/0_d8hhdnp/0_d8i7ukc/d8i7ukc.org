It's frustrating to read. The author has some skill in writing but for me, it comes across as if he's trying too hard to balance things. I.e Harry is stronger, but because he's a Slytherin a lot more people are against him. Also a lot more people are giving him shit and he doesn't react. And events progress pretty much like canon, even though things are wildly different.

[[/spoiler][Despite Harry remembering to use the mirror, the department of mysteries thing still happens. Because of Lucius fucking Malfoy. I shit you not, Harry gathers his "gryffindor" friends (including the Weasleys...) to go and rescue *Lucius Malfoy* from Voldemort. Because he thought that Lucius and I quote "was on Harry's side the whole time". Ludicrous horseshit.]]
