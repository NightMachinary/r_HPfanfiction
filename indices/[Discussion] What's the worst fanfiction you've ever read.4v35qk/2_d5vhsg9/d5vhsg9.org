Someday karma will link to one of mine, I fear. The worst ones are forgettable to me. I don't finish them. But my answer---the ones that are angry, regardless of ship or character. I'm not talking about Harry angry with Dumbledore in OoP angry. I mean someone really using this to pour out the personal, payback-time, black-hearted ugly. It could be grammatically correct with careful metaphors, and it wouldn't matter, but so far that's not been the case for my reading.

If they have a baby come out of Harry's belly button or insist on everyone climaxing together that doesn't really help, either.
