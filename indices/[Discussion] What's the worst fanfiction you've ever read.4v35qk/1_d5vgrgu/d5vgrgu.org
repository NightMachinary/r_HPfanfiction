For me the worst kind of stories are the ones with good premises and strong openings. It's only when you get into the meat of the narrative that it all falls apart.

I'm a slow reader, so by the time I've read my tipping point I will normally have invested at least a couple of hours into any given fic.

Most of the Romance genre is guilty of this and almost every Harry/Fleur ever written.

The fic that defines this feeling of disappointment is Heart and Soul. I stubbornly read forty chapters before giving up. I flicked to the last couple of chapters and knew I'd made the right choice.

Also Cursed Child.
