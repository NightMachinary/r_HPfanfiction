It wasn't a Harry Potter fanfic, but it was the worst thing I ever read. It was a Danny Phantom / Winx Club crossover. It was less that 1000 words, and basically amounted to, "Danny and Bloom fell in love...it was the most pure love ever in the world. They married and were happily in love forever. The End"
