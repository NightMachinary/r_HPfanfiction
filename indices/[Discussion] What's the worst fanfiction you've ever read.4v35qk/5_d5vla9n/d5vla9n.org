I know everyone hates or loves /Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness/ ,I found it amusing and different the first time through. I got to far through /Slaugh/ to turn back, but I had the discipline to stop at chapter 5 for A Peccatis. I just can't stop when there is a series.

same story as [[/r/strawberryshortycake]] just couldn't stop reading.
