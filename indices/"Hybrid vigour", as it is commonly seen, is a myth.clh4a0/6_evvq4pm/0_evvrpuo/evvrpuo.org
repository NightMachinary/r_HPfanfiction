  "Inbreeding means coming from genetically similar stock."

No, inbreeding is a set of conditions caused by extremely genetically similar stock. You can have genetically similar stock and not be inbred.

Yes there's an argument against miscegenation hiding here - not that it's wrong, but that it makes healthier human beings. It does not. It makes regular human beings with more genetically distant stock, which, when the individual is not inbred, does absolutely nothing whatsoever.

But call me a racist again for being against pop science. I'm equally bothered by people thinking that people in the past thought the world was flat. It's just a shame.
