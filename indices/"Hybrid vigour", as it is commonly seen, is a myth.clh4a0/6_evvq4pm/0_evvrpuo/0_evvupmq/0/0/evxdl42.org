If your hypothetical couple from Kent are both descended from families that have lived in Kent for generations, and have similar genetics, they are related. They are some sort of more or less distant cousins: second cousins, or third or fourth or whatever. They have similar genetics because they're related. This is an example of mild inbreeding.

Really, all humans are some sort of cousins, since we're all descended from common ancestors, but some are closer cousins than others.
