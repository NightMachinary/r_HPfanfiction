Maybe some of the confusion here is simply over meanings of words. “Inbred” and “hybrid” are relative terms, like “hot” and “cold.” A cup of coffee, and molten lava, and the sun can all be hot compared to various cold things, although the coffee is cold compared to the sun. A brother-sister marriage, and a first cousin marriage, and a fifth cousin marriage can all be inbreeding compared to other possible pairings, although the fifth cousin marriage will show hybrid vigor compared to the brother-sister marriage.

Iceland has great healthcare and a social safety net, which I'm sure has much more of an effect on their health than their genes.
