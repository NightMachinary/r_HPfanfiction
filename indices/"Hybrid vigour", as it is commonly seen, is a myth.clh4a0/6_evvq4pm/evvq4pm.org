“Purebreds are only unhealthy because they are are inbred, not because their blood comes from genetically similar stock.”

Um, what? Inbreeding means coming from genetically similar stock. At least, it means coming from ancestors who are related to each other, which generally means genetically similar.

It's canon that the purebloods are all somewhat inbred, and canon that some of the most powerful wizards (Dumbledore, Voldemort, arguably Harry) are halfbloods. I don't see why you're arguing. It almost seems like there's an argument against miscegenation hiding here.
