Hybrid vigour isn't a legitimate concept in human beings. The people with the longest lifespans on Earth are the Japanese, not mixed race people, the most intelligent people on Earth are the Ashkenazim - Jews, not mixed race people. By and large, humans appear to be biological equals.

If you could link scientific papers that prove me wrong, I would, in fact, appreciate the opportunity to become better informed.

Hybrid concept exists as a concept when referring to vegetables, but humans are not vegetables. Humans are humans.
