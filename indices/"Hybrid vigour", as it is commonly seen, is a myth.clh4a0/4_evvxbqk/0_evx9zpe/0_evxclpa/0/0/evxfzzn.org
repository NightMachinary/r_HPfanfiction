Cool, we agree that environment has such a huge effect on people, it's practically impossible to find a genetic component for most traits. Also, anyone who cares about traits like longevity, intelligence etc should focus on the environmental factors known to influence these traits, not waste time looking for genetic explanations of variability.

That doesn't mean that genes don't play a part, just that their role is impossible to figure out without doing experiments that are impossible for ethical and practical reasons. I'm going to assume that humans, like other species, have hybrid vigor for many traits, since there's no reason to assume that we're different from other species in this regard.

Ironically, race (even though it has no biological basis) has a big effect on health, because racism has big effects on people's lives and deaths.
