  "Then there's the problem that culture and environment have huge influences on people's behavior, including the traits that add up to intelligence. If one ethnic group really is more intelligent (by some measure) there's no reason to think this difference is due to genes rather than culture and environment.

  Longevity is a trait that's easier to measure than intelligence, but again, we know that lifestyle (diet, exercise, etc) has a huge effect on lifespan, so you can't assume anything about the Japanese having genes for longevity.. "

That was exactly my point. The most intelligent and the longest lived peoples on Earth can thank their lifestyles for that fact, not their racial group. Race, it seems, has absolutely no bearing on how intelligent or how healthy an individual is when compared to far more important environmental factors.

If hybrid vigour affects humans at all, it slightly improves our immune systems, and that is all.
