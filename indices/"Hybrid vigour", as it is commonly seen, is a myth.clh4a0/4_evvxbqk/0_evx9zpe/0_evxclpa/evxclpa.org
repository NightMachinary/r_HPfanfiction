There have been no controlled studies of hybrid vigor in humans because of the obvious ethical problems. As with so much else, we extrapolate from studies of other species. Hybrid vigor is definitely a real phenomenon in many other species, so why wouldn't humans have it too?

You can't just throw around phrases like “the most intelligent people on earth.” There are many problems with that phrase. There's the problem of what intelligence even means: IQ score? That only measures one type of intelligence, the ability to sit still and take a written standardized test, alone. It doesn't measure other important forms of intelligence like the ability to think on one's feet or collaborate with others.

Then there's the problem that culture and environment have huge influences on people's behavior, including the traits that add up to intelligence. If one ethnic group really is more intelligent (by some measure) there's no reason to think this difference is due to genes rather than culture and environment.

Longevity is a trait that's easier to measure than intelligence, but again, we know that lifestyle (diet, exercise, etc) has a huge effect on lifespan, so you can't assume anything about the Japanese having genes for longevity..

In short, it's so difficult to study humans, scientists extrapolate from experiments on model organisms all the time. They can control both genes and environment relatively easily. These experiments show that hybrid vigor is real in many different species. Why wouldn't it be real in humans?

And sorry to disappoint you, but you won't find scientific studies of “mixed race people” because biologically speaking, races don't exist. Race is a social construct. The racial categories constructed by cultures don't correspond to discrete biological groups. If you were to travel north from sub-Saharan Africa, through North Africa, to the Mediterranean, through Europe, to Northern Europe, you'd notice that people tend to get paler, on average, as you go north, but if you tried to draw a line between “black” and “white” people, your placement of that line would be completely arbitrary. Different cultures draw that line in very different places.
