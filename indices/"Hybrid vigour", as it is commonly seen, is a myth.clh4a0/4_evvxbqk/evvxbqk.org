On the assumption that you want to learn about this subject, I've been looking up articles to share with you, comparing the dominance vs overdominance explanations of the observed phenomenon of hybrid vigor. Hybrid vigor is accepted as a real thing by scientists. The only controversy is the mechanism by which it works. It's not a pop science misconception.

Then it occurred to me that you started this by declaring that there is no evidence that contradicts your idea, which suggests that you haven't looked for any evidence, which suggests that you aren't actually interested in learning about this topic. Let me know if you want to read actual scientific papers on this, or if you avoid reading things that contradict your preconceptions.
