It's in the books Dumbledore mother is muggleborn and His father is Pureblood.

And I think that Up until the third book Harry was supposed to be powerful, being able to to drive away hundreds of dementors at the age of thirteen. But then with the shift the books go threw after the third book they sort of back out of the idea that Harry is powerful and try to make him the Everyman.
