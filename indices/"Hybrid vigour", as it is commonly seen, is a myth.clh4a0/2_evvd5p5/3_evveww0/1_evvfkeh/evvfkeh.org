  Especially since Harry for example also isnt exceptionally powerful or anything.

He cast a patronus powerful enough to clear a field of Dementors when he was 13. This (casting a corporeal patronus in the presence of Dementors) is remarked upon several times by older wizards and witches as an exceptional ability. He's powerful enough, he just never had the time to learn much magic during canon beyond the standard school stuff and whatever he needed to meet the latest yearly drama he faced. Who knows what he might have been capable of had his life been easier and his teachers more caring. I'm not saying he's the next Dumbledore, but he's not an average joe wizard.
