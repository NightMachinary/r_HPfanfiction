On the opposing side we have the Weasleys, Dumbledore, many Death Eaters (Like Malfory Sr., Bellatrix), (Sirius and James in school they were very proficient, not the same level as Dumbledore or Tom Riddle).

I don't get how Dumbledore counts as Mixed Blood example.

I really don't think that the book promotes exactly that. Especially since Harry for example also isnt exceptionally powerful or anything.
