As used in fics, hybrid vigor is used correctly most of the time in my experience. However, I feel like most fics read a bit too much into canon. After all, how many whole families do we see enough of to judge them on their breeding? There's the Potters (multiple generations of very capable purebloods), the Malfoys (none of them were real slouches), the Longbottoms (ditto), the Blacks (a lot of early deaths and insanity, but few were /magically/ weak), the Weasleys (Sacred 28-certified, yet all of them are very intelligent and capable), and the Gaunts (generations of inbreeding, but also lack of formal education). There's not much to indicate that many or most of the purebloods were inbred.
