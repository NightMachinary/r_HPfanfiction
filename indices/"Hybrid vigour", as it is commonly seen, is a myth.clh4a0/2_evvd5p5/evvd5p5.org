In the Harry Potter books at least when it comes to magic this seems to be. The case with the main example being Voldemort and to a lesser extent Snape. Both Powerful wizards comeing from the Union of a pureblood and a muggle.

To me it's more like the vinegar and bicarb experiment with non-magic blood being the bicarb of soda and magical blood being the vinegar. The experiment works best when you have th right amout of each. In my mind it's the same with muggle and magic blood you want the best mix of the two to get a strong magic child with the canon example being dumbledore, Tom Riddle, Snape and Harry himself.(a counter argument for this would be seamus Finnagin who also had magical and muggle parent but doesn't seem particularly powerful like the other four examples I listed).
