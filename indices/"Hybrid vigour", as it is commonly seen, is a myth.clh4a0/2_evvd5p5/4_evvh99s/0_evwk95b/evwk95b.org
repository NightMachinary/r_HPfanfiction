You can do this argument. Personally, I think it's a more mental thing, although Squibs make a surprising amount of sense.

Hybrid vigor occurs in plants and Ligers. The plants get multiple traits boosted, since they're more resilient, and Ligers are massive, since the genes regulating growth are missing.

Genetics are complicated. Muggles don't weaken wizards (look at Voldemort), but we see the most accomplished wizards being half-bloods. The lack of inbreeding, coupled with good genetics could be an answer.

You also get this with cows.

It gets more complicated with humans.
