I'd hope so, but seeing as though inbreeding is never mentioned, it's doubtful. It seems more likely to me that the authors just buy into the myth that the more different the genes you muddle together are the healthier and stronger the person becomes - hence the fact that "hybrid vigour" exists as a myth in the first place.

If regular people can believe in hybrid vigour, I'd expect fanfiction authors to be able to believe in it as well.
