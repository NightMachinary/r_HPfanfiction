Huh, I actually never saw what you described used anywhere. All the fics I can think of are about inbreeding and new blood helping to remedy the effects of it. Actually can only think about one fic where your pointed out wrong understanding is used, and that is some Addams Family crossover where the author argues that the Addams' are so powerful because they have every magical creature you can think of in their ancestry.
