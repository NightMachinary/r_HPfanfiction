If the pureblood families have all intermarried for several generations they are Inbreed, even if its only mildly so. I don't remember seeing ANY fic that argued that using all sorts of distantly related stock would be any more of an improvement than a halfblood or muggleborn.

The point is not that "mudblood" is better, but that Pure blood is worse than "Normal" blood.

I've seen arguments FOR pureblood, FROM purebloods. I've seen arguments against inbreeding from non-purebloods. I've not seen "you should breed with muggles because that would make you better" so much as "you should stop breeding with people you know you are related to".

I think you've taken it too far for some reason.
