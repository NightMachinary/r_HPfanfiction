I think it's actually important. Memes like these can lead to racism against peoples that have prominent recessive traits.

I've once saw a weird thing written about Americans of Finnish descent here on reddit comparing their hair to that of the Targaryrens and mentioning inbreeding, even though that's just how Finns look and even though that idea is particularly insane since the Nordics has what is probably lowest historical rate of consanginuous marriages in the world. Lower even than continental Europe and Britain.

Effectively the comment was 'guy has never seen actual blond people before'.
