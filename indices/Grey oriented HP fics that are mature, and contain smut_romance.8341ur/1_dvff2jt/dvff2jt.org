Unlike the other stories that were recommended, I feel like this one has TOO much smut. Haha. The smut overtakes the plot quite often in this story, I've found (which was extremely disappointing to me, personally, but it sounds like it's exactly what you're looking for). However, it's starring a "Grey" Harry that's only in it for himself and for advancing his own knowledge and power. It's written pretty well, but the pacing at times slogs when the author decides to dedicate a substantial amount of time to the smut rather than advancing the plot. Clocks in at almost 700k words currently.
