It's a female Harry with no pairings, but I really think you should give it a shot. It starts a bit slow and Tom Riddle is a politician and not a crazy terrorist monster, but please, please give it a shot. There is plenty of potions brewing, Draco and Pansy are actually likeable and the first three books are complete and the fourth one is ongoing. (There is also an entire subplot with OCs about Diagon Alley which is honestly more like a small city and not just a street.) And it's not a dark Harry (thankfully).
