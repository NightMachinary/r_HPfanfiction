  Time Travel AU: Harry Potter had always led a miserable life. That was before his best friend and godfather had their souls sucked out by demons right in front of him. As if things weren't bad enough, he suddenly finds himself in the year 1942. Things only become more complicated when, among others, an enigmatic prodigy fixes her unwavering attention upon him. Harry/Fem Riddle
