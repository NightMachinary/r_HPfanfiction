I'm glad to hear you enjoyed it! I know exactly the feeling you're describing --- I couldn't tell you how many times I've come across fics and been like “Please tell me this is new.”

I'm in the process of writing a Flowerpot one-shot that's for what was the Flowerpot discord server's Emily Collection. Things have gotten... complicated with the Collection in the last 24 hours, but I'm still going to finish the story.

After that, it's back to DiD and my Percy Jackson fic.
