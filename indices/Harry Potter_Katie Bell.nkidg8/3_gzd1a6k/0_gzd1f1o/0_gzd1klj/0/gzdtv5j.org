One thing I enjoyed about it was the love-triangle aspect: Even though she knew she had no chance with him after she realized she'd put a proverbial 9mm into his feelings for her, she still pined for him throughout the fic.

Part of me was actually rooting for Harry/Katie because, while I do enjoy Harry/Fleur, the ultimate pairing is pretty over-done in comparison.

Katie actually acted like a teenage girl doing dumb things around her crush, which was realistic (trust me on that -- most of my friend group growing up was female, so it's how they act, lol).
