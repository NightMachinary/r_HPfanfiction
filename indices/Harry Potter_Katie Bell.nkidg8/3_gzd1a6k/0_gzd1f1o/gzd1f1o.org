IIRC the original had some initial Harry/Katie where she fucks it up through the typical foibles of being a teenage girl, so I presume the remaster has the same thing, too.

I remember reading the original and I might give the remastered version a go in the future, but at the moment it's a bit of a "been there, done that" thing for me.
