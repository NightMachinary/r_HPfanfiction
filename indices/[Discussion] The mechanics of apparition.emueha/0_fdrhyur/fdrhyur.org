There's "Searching for the Power", not gonna link it, because Rule8. Harry sums it up as intent-based wandless magic that swaps one position with another. He even experiments and finds out the signature crack sound that happens is the displacement of air. And he goes on to prove that if you keep your magic close to your skin instead of a sphere around you, you aparate soundlessly. And reappear naked. Then he had to expand the magic to surround his clothes too. For clothed soundless apparation.
