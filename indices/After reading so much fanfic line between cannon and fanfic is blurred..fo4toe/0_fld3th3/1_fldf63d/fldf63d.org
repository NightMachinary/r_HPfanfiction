Same with Spanish for me.

Though I will never forget the LatAm translators for the "Not my daughter, you /bad witch/" line

*"Â¡Mi hija no, perra!"* would have been epic. (The movies kept it)

Also, I just watched the scene in the movies. Molly was throwing around voiceless /green spells/. That's pretty damn badass.
