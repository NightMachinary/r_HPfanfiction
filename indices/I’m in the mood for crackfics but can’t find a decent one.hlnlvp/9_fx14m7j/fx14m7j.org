Sadly, many of my favorite crackfics are unfinished, including:

- linkffn(Storybook Hero by DogbertCarroll)
- linkao3(Messing with Time by Slythernim) /Just had a new chapter posted after a long hiatus./
- linkffn(Adventures in Magick by PseudonymousEntity)
- linkao3(To Catch a Thief by ElviraKitties)

But there are some that are finished:

- linkffn(Let's Do the Time Warp Again by Rorschach's Blot)
- linkffn(Harry Potter Master of Malicious Compliance by Watermelonsmellinfellon) /I especially love the scene where Harry trolls Voldiie by drawing dicks in the diary./
- linkffn(Two Weeks in the Alley by BajaB)
- linkao3(Villain Starter Kits by Elvirakitties)
- [[http://occlumency.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=3006][The Owl Chronicles]] by Mouse. /Largely overlooked because it's not on the popular archive sites./
- And the classic linkffn(The Original Naked Quidditch Match by evilgoddss)
