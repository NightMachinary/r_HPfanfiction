linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions) has quite an interesting storyline and an excellent Snape redemption (plus decent Draco redemption), while still being full of British (ie ridiculous) humour.

  The problem, or perhaps the solution, was that Harry fell in love with Potions. He'd never been particularly interested in school before, being preoccupied with avoiding Dudley, chores, avoiding Dudley, keeping the peace with his relatives to avoid his uncle's version of child rearing, and avoiding Dudley.

  Snide or not, Snape's commentary on Harry's abysmal Potions skills actually was good advice, if you ignored almost everything he said.

  Harry really hated that he was Harry's favorite professor. Why couldn't he have liked Professor McGonagall and learned how to turn into an owl, like a sane person.
