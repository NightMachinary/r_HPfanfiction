I think it was originally meant as pure crack, but it somehow got away from the author's control and became more serious. Still it is a good read (although I have some issues with it), although it feels like unfinished story (e.g., fourth or fifth year is the last when I can accept more or less persuasive Drarry), the author obviously didn't know how to go on.
