  A montage of what would have happened at every stage were Harry and co. to have died to to the actions of inept adults. (Malfunctioning broom, the corridor, encountering the basilisk in Hogwarts, Chamber of Secrets, Dementor's Kiss, Moody just kidnaps him at the start of the year, Dementor's Kiss again, etc.)

  The twins steal the Philosopher's stone.

  Dobby assassinates every member of the Death Eaters.

  AU where everyone is slightly more competent, including teachers, students, politicians, and Death Eaters.

Strangely enough, I think I've seen fics for all four of these.\\
[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/670548][The Boy Who Died A Lot]] has a time-travelling Snape begrudgingly saving Harry via time turner every time he gets killed.\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12002179/1/Out-of-Bounds][Out of Bounds]] is a one-shot which features, not just the Weasley twins, but practically every student, competing to reach the end of the third-floor corridor in the shortest time.\\
And [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11029663/1/Promotion][Promotion]] is apparently about everyone being a tad more competent. I haven't read it for a while so I couldn't say, but I do remember a scene where Quirrelmort foregoes the troll attack, just unleashes the basilisk into the Great Hall, and uses the diversion to murder Harry (who he put in detention beforehand) and go for the Philosopher's Stone.

...Unfortunately, I can't remember the fic I saw with Dobby (or was it Kreacher?) being used as an assassin. It was something to do with a marriage law and mass-slaughtering all the candidates? It started with Hermione helping to sort the various options for marriage and ended with the reveal that the house-elf was behind the killings.
