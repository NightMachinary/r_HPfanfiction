  The twins steal the Philosopher's stone.
#+end_quote

That idea really makes me afraid of what the twins would do with something like the Philosopher's Stone

#+begin_quote
  Dobby assassinates every member of the Death Eaters.
#+end_quote

We have no idea how powerful House-Elves actually are (I mean we did see Dobby attack Lucius, because he was going to attack Harry). Seeing something like that would be interesting.

#+begin_quote
  AU where everyone is slightly more competent, including teachers, students, politicians, and Death Eaters.
#+end_quote

Yes please.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort is an eccentrically sinister yet not evil DADA teacher.
#+end_quote

That'd be interesting.

#+begin_quote
  Snape uses the Dark Mark to lure the rest of the Death Eaters -- and Voldemort -- into a trap.
#+end_quote

Ooh! I'd like to read that.

#+begin_quote
  Luna gets the diary instead.
#+end_quote

Ooh, I wonder how she'd react to it? That'd be interesting.

#+begin_quote
  Ron finds the Death Note
#+end_quote

Oh dear, that'd be terrifying yet interesting! Draco you better apologize for everything you've done!

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort manages to repair his soul as Harry Potter calls him out and he feels remorse. The entire wizarding world is outraged as he dies with a contented look upon his face.
#+end_quote

Would be interesting if you could pull it off.

#+begin_quote
  Harry is killed early on in his adventures, and comes back as a ghost. This makes killing Voldemort a whole lot harder.
#+end_quote

I like that idea!

If anyone knows of any stories that has these plots, let me know.
