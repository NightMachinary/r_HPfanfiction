*So is it something like this: (Please excuse my sad attempt at this prompt)*

"...And that kids, is how I met your mother." Harry finished cheerfully.

"Woah!" exclaims his youngest son. "Did grandmother really hit you with an entail expelling curse when you asked for permission to marry mum?"

Harry nodded. "Oh yes. But that was nothing compared to your mother when she was in labour with the two of you. That was the time when she came up with her particularly painfully creative curses."

"I thought you said that she called the family magiks to gut you from inside out?" Harry's older son asked him innocently.

Harry flinched despite himself. "Yeah... Boys, as your father, I should advise you that witches are scary. Hell hath no wrath like a woman scorned, and all. Hormonal witches are insane and pregnant hormonal witches are down right terrifying. I think it's time to pass on some wisdom to the two of you- from a father to his sons." Harry said before lowering his voice, like he was telling a great secret, making the five year old and seven year old lean in with anticipation. "Remember, that just because a witch does not have a wand, it will not stop her from picking up a scalpel and trying to gut you for telling her that she looks 'pretty' and not 'beautiful. Bloody mad that woman is." Harry muttered before looking horrified. "Don't tell your mother I said that."

Both boys laughed at their fathers terrified expression.

"Alright, Dad." said his oldest, still chuckling.

"But dad," began his youngest. "if you are so scared of mummy so much, why do you still love her?"

"I don't know, my boy," said Harry looking thoughtful. "Why do you love her?"

"She's my mother." his youngest replied simply. "She's scary but she cares. Remember when Uncle Ron said mean things about big brother and mum threw her six inch very pointy heels directly into his eyes? She loves us, in her own way. She sings us songs, reads bed-time stories, kisses us goodnight and buys us anything we want. She's a super hero."

"I think that is the first time somebody has called your mother a hero." Harry mused. He stood up. "Anyway it's time for bed. So both of you go to sleep. Chop chop."

"Awww..." Both boys moaned sadly.

"Just one more minute!" They said in union, his youngest dramatically throwing himself at Harry's feet and his oldest sighing sadly like in a Shakespearean play.

Harry chuckled at their antics. They got their flair of dramatics from their mother, not that she would ever admit it.

"Sleep, now. Your mother is in France, she'll be back in time to make you both pancakes in the morning." Harry said and watched as the boys grinned widely.

"Mum does make the best pancakes." His oldest son admitted as his younger brother nodded dreamily.

Harry put them both to bed, kissing their forehead as he did.

"Good night Sirius, goodnight Regulus."

"Good night, father!" The boys chorused loudly.

He walked out of their room just in time to receive a message in his two-way mirror from his boss, Kingsley.

"Hey Kingsley! Since their mother is not here, I just finished putting the boys to bed. I'll check in with the department in a minute. Whats up?" Harry asked casually.

Kingsley scowled. "Your wife- that's what's up."

Harry sighed tiredly. "What did she do this time?"

"Broke out people from the newly built Azkaban. Again." Kingsley replied angrily. "Forth time this year, and it's only May!" 

"Really? We had an agreement that she would not do anything like that until next weekend." Harry exclaimed in shock. "I thought that she was in France now anyway."

"Thats the problem, she is." Kingsley replied. "She either paid or impervioused some minions to do her dirty work. I don't know what's the worst part- that all of the minions are refusing to testify against her or that she completely messed up many alliances with France due to speaking sweet words to the ear of the French Minister of Magic!"

Harry chuckled faintly. "Yup, thats my wife for you. I'll figure something out, don't worry."

"You better," said Kingsley. "I get that she is your wife, Harry. But that is one manipulative, sick person. Worse than her one mother, even, and I didn't even think that was possible!"

"Runs in the family, I guess." Harry said weakly. "I just hope the boys got more of the Potter genes."

"I hope so too." Kingsley admitted. "I don't want to add the incredible Potter luck to the list of flaws. Seriously Harry! Out of all the women in the world, why her?"

Harry shrugged. "She was- is- gorgeous."

"You could have married a Veela then."

"And she had this aura around her." Harry continued without stopping, a soft, small smile unknowingly playing on his face. "The kind of aura that said that she was powerful, independent and ready to take on the world. I just never thought how literal that statement was."

"Well it is." Kingsley said bluntly. "And fix it, Potter."

"What happened to happy wife, happy life?"

"Marry someone who isn't a Dark Lady in training, and then we'll see about that." Kingsley replied.

"Alright. I'll go and talk to her." Harry resigned.

"I honestly don't know how you make your marriage work, being on completely opposite sides of the spectrum and all." Kingsley said. "And also parenting your kids admittedly quite well together... But seriously, do us all a huge favour and try to kill your wife, Potter. Or at least impair her for a while."

"We both know that she'll kill me first." Harry said. "Slowly and painfully, while wearing a lovely smile."

Kingsley sighed. "True. Good luck, Harry. I have to go now."

"Goodbye." said Harry as the mirror went blank.

Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived and Saviour of the Wizarding world looked at a framed portrait hung on the hallways of the Potter Manor.

It had a picture of a man with black hair and green eyes, two adorable little curly dark-haired boys- one with green eyes and the other with silvery grey eyes- both grinning widely. Standing behind the boys and next to the man was an impossibly beautiful curly, black haired woman with the same silvery-grey eyes as the oldest boy. She had an arm looped over the man's and her head was rested lightly on the man's shoulders. Her face contained a smirk, putting her dimples on display.

"Oh Aquilla," Harry sighed as he stared at the portrait with a fond smile. "What did you do now, Miss Lestrange?"
