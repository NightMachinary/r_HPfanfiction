Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief) was my favorite Harry/Hermione fic so far, especially because there's a series of other relationships that don't work out that well beforehand. The two main characters don't get together until after Hogwarts and both have their own secrets that strain the relationship. Including their constant cat-and-mouse (or should I say man-and-cat?) chases around various crime scenes.
