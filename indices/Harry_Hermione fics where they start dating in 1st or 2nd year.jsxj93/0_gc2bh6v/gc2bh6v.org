In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10914042/1/Sympathetic-Properties][Sympathetic Properties]] they start kind of dating in the summer following the second year. I really liked how the Goblin Nation is portrayed in this fic.

The goblins had a contract with Flamel that he would never use the Philosopher's Stone and could never leave an island, but got protection from the goblins on the island. When the goblins discover the stone is gone chaos ensues
