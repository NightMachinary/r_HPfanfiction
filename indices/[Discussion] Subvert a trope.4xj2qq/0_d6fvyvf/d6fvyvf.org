Manipulative Dumbledore: Dumbledore has been burned by trusting others in the past and keeps his secrets because thats the only way to defeat Voldemort and the Death Eaters. He even keeps crucial information from Harry, which might have been able to save lives (Sirius) if it had been out there. Despite all this, Dumbledore loves Harry like the son he never had and is determined that Harry receive the training and information he needs in order able to defeat Voldemort once and for all.

This sounds suspiciously like canon...
