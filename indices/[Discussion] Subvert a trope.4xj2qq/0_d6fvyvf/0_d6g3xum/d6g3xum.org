What about this?

Harry reminds Dumbledore of his long lost one true love Gellert Grindelwald. The same passion, the same good heart and will to do good. Because of it, Dumbledore is unable to trust Harry, despite loving him as a child, but he knows he had to work with him because of the prophecy. With time he's able to grow over it but much too late, he's then cursed by the Gaunt ring and doesn't have time to properly train Harry before he has to go... He's also sure that he will have to face and kill Harry in the end for a huge part of the story.
