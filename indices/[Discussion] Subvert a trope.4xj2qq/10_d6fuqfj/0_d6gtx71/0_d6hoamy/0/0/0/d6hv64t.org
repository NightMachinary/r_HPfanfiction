  You actually think Harry and Naruto are similar in personality?
#+end_quote

Similar, /yes/. Perfect copies, /no/. Which is why I said so, and listed multiple reasons why they are closer then Ron-Naruto are. At no point did I say they were mirror images. Are you trying to claim Ron-Naruto and Harry-Sasuke are perfectly matched?

  And no, Harry is not outgoing for the most and he does not seek attention, Naruto is both.
#+end_quote

I never said Harry seeks attention. In fact, I pointed out that Harry not wanting attention was a difference between Harry and Sasuke. Where is the evidence that Harry isn't outgoing? I've already pointed out a number of actions in the books where he is. If you are going to claim he isn't you need to back that up. Show at least one instance where Harry was shy and timid.
