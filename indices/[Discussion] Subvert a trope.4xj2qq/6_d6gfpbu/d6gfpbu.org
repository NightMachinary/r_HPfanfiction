Bellatrix is actually very much in love with her husband Rodolphus Lestrange. She in fact has agreed to serve Voldemort in exchange for his life, and is now bond to keep her word by her honour, which she deemed her most valuable possession, even more valuable than her life. She will do anything to serve the dark lord to the better of her abilities.
