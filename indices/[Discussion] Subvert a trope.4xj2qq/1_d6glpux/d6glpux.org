  Ron Weasley is capable of eating far more than everyone else and is the most powerful wizard since Merlin.

Totally canon:

- When others were using their magic to levitate feathers, he was levitating mountain troll clubs. Using an inherited wand.
- He spent his second year using a broken wand. He still passed all his classes. Clearly, there's talent for controlled wandless magic there.
- Ronbledore Theory makes a lot more sense in this context.
