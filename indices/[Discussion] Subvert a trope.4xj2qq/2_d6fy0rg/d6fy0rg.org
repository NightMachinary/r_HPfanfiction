Harry rescues Daphne from Draco's sexual assault. Daphne is grateful but doesn't swoon or fall in love. Harry feels cheated somehow and hides it poorly. Daphne realizes this and gives Harry a "let's be friends" talk. Harry isn't the type to be angry about it; instead, he gets mopey, and Daphne has to spend the better part of an hour comforting him. Afterwards, it's awkward, and she avoids him. She has no allies or support group anymore and tries to shrink into the woodwork.

No, that's too depressing.
