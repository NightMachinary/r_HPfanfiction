My apologies. I thought this was a place for fan fiction, not for [[/u/howtopleaseme]]'s headcanon.

Harry grew up in the UK in the 1980s. He is in some ways a product of that culture. Men expecting sex in exchange for being nice to women is a feature of that culture. It is not /unusual/ to have that attitude. You don't have to be a glory seeker or motivated by reputation or anything like that to expect sex in exchange for being nice to women.

As an example of how pervasive and easily ignored this attitude is, look at the phrase "friend zone", how widely used it is, and its connotations. It's not unusual to accept the concept of a friend zone as being valid and existing. The attitude I'm talking about is a small intuitive step from the friend zone.
