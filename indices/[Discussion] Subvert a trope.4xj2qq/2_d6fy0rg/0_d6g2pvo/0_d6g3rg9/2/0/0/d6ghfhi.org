I think mostly young writers tend to do it.

There may be the possibility of the female character falling in love with the guy eventually, like if the guy stays and tries to help her through it.

Or maybe she'd latch on to the guy because it was an traumatic event to experience and because of the trauma she mistakes her feelings as love if she has continued relations with the guy?

But all the she might fall in love with her saviour are due to keeping in contact and not immediate love just because you saved me.
