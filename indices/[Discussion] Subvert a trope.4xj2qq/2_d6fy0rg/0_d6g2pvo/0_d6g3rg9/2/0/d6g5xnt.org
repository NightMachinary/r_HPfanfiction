I can't see that happening either.

Edit: That must be one of the most ridiculous tropes out there. I mean "Boy saves girl from rape, girl falls in love". I mean, you just avoided rape, I don't think your thirst thoughts are about love or sex... And it seems like a pretty extreme way to put up the "boy meets girl" scene. Thoughts?
