You've missed out on a) the protagonist being saved from gang rape by her love interest b) the beautiful 'bitchy' character who was gangraped to death (pre vampirism) c) the maternal figure who committed suicide to escape an abusive husband and d) the amnesiac discovering her past held a stalker who wanted to collect and kill her.

The vampire dudes, of course, got to die by sexy seductress, disease, accident, and bear attack. The author has an obvious thing for male violence against women.
