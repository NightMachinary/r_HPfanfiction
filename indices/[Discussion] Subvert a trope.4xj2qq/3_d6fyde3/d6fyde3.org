Petunia's relationship with Lily was mostly bratty older sister at first, no huge resentment. After Lily's death, she resented how the magical world took her away and killed her. She's determined not to let it do the same with Harry. So she's a good parent for him. She takes an interest when he goes off to Hogwarts, finds a career she can pursue remotely, relocates to Hogsmeade, arranges weekly visits, and attends all his Quidditch games.
