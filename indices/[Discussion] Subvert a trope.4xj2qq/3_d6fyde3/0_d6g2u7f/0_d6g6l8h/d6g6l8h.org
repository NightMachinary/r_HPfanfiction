Good point.

Alternate: Petunia married Vernon for a reason. She wanted access to his family's magic.

The Dursleys were mages who left the magical world to avoid the constant stream of Dark Lords, but they were drawn in every generation thanks to the Hogwarts register. Lacking the skills of the Gaunt family at protective enchantments to hide from the registry, they instead turned to more difficult options: removing magical abilities from their line.

It took a fair bit of research, but they came on three methods. One, which they used on their own children, involved systematic abuse and blood runes. The second was a ritual that drained a fetus's magical abilities. The last is fatal.

Having seen what happened to Lily, Petunia wanted to keep her own family well away from Magical Britain. The Dursley ritual would ensure that no child of hers fell victim to the wizarding world.

And then Harry came. The prenatal ritual wouldn't help a yearling infant. Killing the child would do it no good. That only left one way for Harry to stay free. So they abused Harry, and they took his blood to etch runes around the house, but the blood-based protections that Dumbledore set up prevented them from working.

In the end, this mistreatment provided the power Voldemort knew not: Harry used the Dursley's third method, destroyed Voldemort's magic, and vanquished him.
