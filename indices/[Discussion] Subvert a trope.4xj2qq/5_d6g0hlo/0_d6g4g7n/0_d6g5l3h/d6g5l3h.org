I put the Ron bit mostly because you always have this fic where Ron picks on Harry because Ron's a dick. I think Ron being unable to understand why his hero behaves like he does, and blaming him for the death of his uncles (for exemple) would be a good subvertion. But Ron being a good guy, they would finaly get along well after a time.

For Draco, I can honestly see him picking on Harry because his status of BWL and his apparent weakness. At the very least it will give him kudos with the Slytherins.

And let's be honest, a story needs some conflict, those two are good to provide it.
