One day when Harry is 7, the Dursleys go too far. Harry discovers magic while locked hurt into his cupboard. He discovers that he is a lot more powerful than the people around him. Affraid, he decides that since he's so much more powerful and strong than the others he'll have to be a lot more cautious as well. He will not interfere in the affairs of others, always try to avoid confrontation and always fight his own anger, for fear of hurting somebody. As a result, he won't be sorted in Griffindor, for lack of courage, but in Ravenclaw (where he can best avoid others). Dumbledore will have to take him under his tutelage far sooner than in canon, to reverse the blocks Harry has put on himself. Harry will have a really hard time accepting that he has to eventually face Voldemort. At first he'll be friendly with Hemione, a bit of a outcast herself, but her personnality will soon be too much for him to bear, they will finally put up but only in the later years. Harry will be more or less alone in his first year and then will befriend Luna and Colin Crevey in his second year. It will become better for him after he meet his godfather at the end of third year. He will be a target for Draco and his goons as well as Ron and other Griffindors who don't anderstand why the boy who lived behave the way he does, but will eventually become good friends.
