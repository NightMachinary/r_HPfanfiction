Manipulative Dumbledore: He's genuinely trying his best to be good.

Checking arms to find death eaters: Voldemort realized this might happen and created a spell that could remotely put dark marks on his enemies, though they were just tattoos, not magic.

The cupboard under the stairs was actually surprisingly large and comfortable. Vernon and Petunia weren't actively abusive, though they were negligent.

Severus Snape is forgiven for taking away points by the staff unfairly because they honestly don't feel points matter much. They just view it as a system to get students to behave.

The prefects bathroom Harry goes to in book 4 is actually the /male/ prefects bathroom. There is a separate one for females.

The ancient and most noble house title is one that the Blacks came up with for themselves, not an honorific given to certain families. It does not reflect anything about wizarding society except the Blacks.

Ted Tonks is taken care of by Andromeda Tonks. I believe that JKR mentioned that in an interview once, but no one seems to remember it.

The reason that Slytherin house seems like a house for the troublemakers is that the sorting hat has been ordered by the professors to put the people who seem based on their brains like they might become future troublemakers in that house, so they can be more easily kept away from other students.

Guns are /not/ effective on wizards. There could be a number of reasons for this: Wizard robes can block kinetic piercing objects, wizards could be much tougher than Muggles, in the time it takes to properly aim a gun a wizard can easily put up a shield, the killing curse is genuinely more effective...

Professor Binns isn't just a bad teacher, it's that History of Magic is genuinely that boring of a subject.

Wandless magic is not trainable because it is only accessible in times of extreme emotion.

The Order of the Pheonix was an effective force that managed to kill a lot of Death Eaters (albeit unnamed ones), but they are trying to remain covert in book 5 and are very good at not letting the main characters know about their operations because they feel they are too young.

Goblins and Centaurs, with a few exceptions, are dicks. That is why they are treated badly.
