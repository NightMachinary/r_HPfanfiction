  Guns are not effective on wizards. There could be a number of reasons for this: Wizard robes can block kinetic piercing objects, wizards could be much tougher than Muggles, in the time it takes to properly aim a gun a wizard can easily put up a shield, the killing curse is genuinely more effective...

This will need more work. In order...

- If that were true, shield robes would be unnecessary. However, shield robes do exist separately from normal robes.

- Wizards may be tougher than muggles, but you're underestimating the ludicrous amount of energy behind a bullet. Even pitifully small handgun rounds have enough energy to cause damage in remote parts of the body simply from shockwave of the body absorbing the energy. Wizards would have to be nearly Superman to be bullet-resilient.

- Well, possibly, but that's only if they see it coming. It'd really be a "who acted first" scenario, which is really how that works, magic or not. At less than 100 yards, a wizard might be able to see what's coming and put up a shield before the gunman fires. Any farther, we're well beyond the effective range of a wand from every example we've seen, and most people can't see details that fine much farther.

- I'll give you that. In terms of killing power, well, the magic that instantly kills somebody is more effective than the brute force method of throwing a fast piece of metal at them hoping to cause lethal damage. Still, lethality is only part of the picture. Otherwise, soldiers would all be armed with M2's and anti-materiel rifles.

My personal theory as to why we never see guns is three-fold:

First, wizards never adopted guns because they don't replace wands. Wands are like knives. They're a universal tool used in everyday life (or at least, what knives used to be). They just also happen to be capable of every other task imaginable. You don't get much benefit from having guns. Though there's a lot of comparisons of wands to guns, they're actually pretty far apart in intended purpose.

Second, by the time guns were /decisively/ more effective killing devices, wizards had long since been removed from muggle cultures. When muggles and wizards interacted more, the most advanced guns were short-range matchlocks. Noisy, relatively inaccurate, single shot, slow to load, and just generally a pain to use. The only other similar weapon being /cannons/, which are massive artillery meant to be used against armies and ships, not individuals in a duel. For wizarding purposes, guns are probably less efficient overall.

Third, magical healing makes anything not lethal in the next 15 minutes basically irrelevant. As long as dark magic isn't involved, healing wounds is easy. Limbs can be reattached without major issue, bones can be completely regrown overnight, and minor wounds can be solved in a matter of seconds. Unless you'll definitely kill somebody in a few minutes, a wizard can either heal themselves or find somebody who can. Therefore, you either need to use a /really/ big round, be very accurate, or riddle them with holes.
