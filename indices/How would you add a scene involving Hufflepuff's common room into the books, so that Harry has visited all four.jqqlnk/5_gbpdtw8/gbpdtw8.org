The Battle of the Astronomy Tower is much more violent as Voldemort himself enters Hogwarts through the vanishing cabinet. Students are asked to take shelter in their common rooms. Since Voldemort enters at the seventh floor, there is no way for Harry to return to the towers so he hides in the Hufflepuff common room since Slytherin is not an option.
