hufflepuff party. cause they have parties and Harry being the boy who lived gets invited. his inability to party will ruin his future access though.

or something involving the kitchens. maybe he visits Dobby or other house elf, or he gets food from there for some reason. he puts his invisibility cloak on and leaves, but some hufflepuffs are there acting ... suspicious. following them, he soon discovers why. it's a... secret hufflepuff party!
