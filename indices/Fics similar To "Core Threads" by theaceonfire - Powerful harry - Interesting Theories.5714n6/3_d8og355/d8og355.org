linkffn(Knowledge is Useful, but Power is Power) does a lot of magic exploration. Harry is pretty powerful, but... Well, that would be spoilers.

linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) also does a lot of Potions theory development, with some general magical theory as well. Harry/Rigel has a lot of power, but in a surprisingly not overpowered way (it comes with its downsides).
