Ive had several people recommend this either on here or in PM's. To be honest it sounds kinda boring from the description (although the description is bare bones). Mind giving me a slightly more thorough overview (without any major spoilers of course)? Does he simply go around learning things or is there action, romance, drama, or other such components? Is he dark/grey/light, have a goal, or something?

You get my drift. Thanks!
