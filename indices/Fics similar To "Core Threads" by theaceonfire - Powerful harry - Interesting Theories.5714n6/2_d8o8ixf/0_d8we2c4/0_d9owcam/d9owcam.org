I can't properly explain this story but I have had it recommended to me multiple times over the past few months and I hesitated to that terrible description.. I finally sat down and read it and holy moly it is amazing. Harry is a bit spacey but it is still a good read. Give it atleast a shot and it does have an end goal and some interesting humor in it.
