Depends on your definition of ships since everyones seems different. There are no current "couples" in it, but quite a few platonic relationships that could become more, although its a bit of a guessing game. They are all 11/12 in it for the most part so maybe later in the story as they age or something.

Its a hard story to define to be honest as it takes a very interesting approach to things.
