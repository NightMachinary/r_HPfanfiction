An idea to use is to have another character either know/figure out/learn or have learned the power the character is going to use.

E.g: perhaps Harry learns this "ancient way of the sword" and he decimates Voldemort in the graveyard. But he himself is blindsided when Lucius Malfoy whips a sword out of his cane and counters him with far swifter skill and experience. Having delved into it as a boy, believing it to be a technique only the Malfoy's still practiced.

Thus, Harry then has a reasonable adversary AND no longer has the element of surprise. Of course Voldemort would then fleece any knowledge/expertise he could from Lucius and be (at the very least) more prepared for a confrontation with this ancient magic in the future. Maybe even deigning that his followers MUST learn at least the basics, as the Light side would be just as ignorant to the techniques as they had been.

Immediately you've got even more intrigue. The Dark Side is more powerful and prepared BECAUSE Harry used this ancient magic (giving a tangible consequence to him whilst also ensuring he can't just mow down any opposition on his own) and you've also put the good guys on the back foot as this uber-powerful magic that was their trump card has fallen into the hands of the enemy. And they are woefully unprepared to deal with it, a dilemma that Harry could feel personally responsible for and lead to further character development.

An idea I ALWAYS subscribe to is that there is nothing wrong with tropes. The only thing right or wrong is how they are written. Subverting established tropes and ideas does not inherently make something good, following through with established ideas does not inherently make a piece of work bad.
