There's an ongoing Supernatural crossover called Love, Fate and Prophecy that's worth a look - it has a pretty unique take on MoD that ties in with spn canon fairly neatly. It's still updating regularly.

The Consequences of Ascension is a possibility too, though that one hasn't been updated since February. It's a MerlinTV/Percy Jackson crossover, and what's there is pretty good.

The Crownless King is complete, and a cracky take on both MoD and the whole raising himself thing. It's also inspired by covid. If you missed this one, definitely check it out.
