  Hunters are not allowed to raise magical children. When it is discovered that Mary is pregnant with a wizarding child, MACUSA steps in, and the Potters step up. Henry Winchester is raised as Harry Potter until security concerns send him to a family that does not know he exists. As Winchester luck dictates, the road will not be smooth. Especially when Heaven intervenes.

  When Harry Potter defeats Lord Voldemort at the Battle of Hogwarts arcane magic combines with the Deathly Hallows to an unforeseen consequence. Trying to raise Teddy and deal with those consequences as best as possible while desperately wishing his Saving People Thing wasn't quite so strong, Harry grudgingly involves himself in another war when he hears the Great Prophecy and realises people are expecting children to save the world again. Dragging Merlin along with him, Harry tries to keep his godson safe while his unexpected interference throws the Fates into an unknown future. Can he keep everyone safe in the end?

  He didn't know what was worse. That he'd been shot and was bleeding out or that he had been shot and was bleeding out as a result of a toilet paper raid. Shot for a roll of single-ply bog roll.
