Hey, I'm not sure if this is an MOD!Harry story but He's immortal, it's a very captivating story for those who like evil or dark Harry with good or a moderately sane!voldemort.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/11131988/][www.fanfiction.net/s/11131988/]] It's a fanfic by Tiro in FanFiction.net There's a prequel, the main story and a sequel with a Drabble too So, it's pretty long

The rest should be available in Tiro's profile called the birth of nightmare man which is the prequel, the nightmare man's journey which is the sequel and fractured time which is the Drabble, and the main story's called The nightmare Man
