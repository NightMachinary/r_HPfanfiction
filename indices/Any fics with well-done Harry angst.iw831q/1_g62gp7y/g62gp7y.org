Since you mentioned you like Drarry and Harry/Ron I'd recommend crossposting to [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]].

Most of the angsty Drarry fics I know have the angst more on Draco's side than Harry's so I hope you're okay with that.

Stop All the Clocks has character death (Draco is dead) and flashes between past and present, so Harry is definitely the one suffering. Away Childish Things deals with Dursley abuse. All the other fics I'd say have the angst mostly or more on Draco's side.
