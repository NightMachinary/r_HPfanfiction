Had to give you thumbs up for Stop All the Clocks, and I definitely second that one. I legitimately cried at the end of that fic. I don't know anything about the author, but in my opinion, it really reads like someone who's lost someone (perhaps even in a similar, abrupt fashion). It has tons of angst, but it's also done in a realistic way (I think).

Away Childish Things is also good, well done, but not as heavy on the angst.
