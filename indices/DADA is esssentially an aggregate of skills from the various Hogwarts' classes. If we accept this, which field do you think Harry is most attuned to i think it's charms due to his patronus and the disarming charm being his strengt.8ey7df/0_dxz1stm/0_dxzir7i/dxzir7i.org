To be honest, I really like the fact that Harry Potter becomes an Auror. It's very "Harry" of him. Yes, he was thrust into most of the canonical problems against his will, but he's very adamant about protecting as many people as possible. He may not believe in the Ministry's justice, but he's a very just person and believes, I think, that everyone deserves justice. Be it negative or positive.

An Auror /really/ makes sense for him.

But, at the same time, I cannot fathom him being part of any ministry for long. I think vigilantism, to an extent, also fits well with his character. But that's an entirely different argument.
