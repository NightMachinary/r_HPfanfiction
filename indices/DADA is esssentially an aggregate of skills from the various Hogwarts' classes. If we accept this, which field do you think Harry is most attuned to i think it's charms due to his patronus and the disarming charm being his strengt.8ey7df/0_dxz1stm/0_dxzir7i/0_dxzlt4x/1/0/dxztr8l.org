Well, I was always under the impression that Harry (or at least Hermione) would realize that there's dire need to reform the system. You can't really say "Well it's fine as long as the right people are in charge". I'm talking about major government reform, not just "pass a law for the wellfare of Elves". Disentangle executive/judicative/legislative branches of government, write a constitution that makes this mandatory... etc. Guarantee basic (human) rights to humans and human-like creatures.

There's no better time to do this than after Voldemort's defeat... and everyone just going on playing Aurors and Ministers just seems really meh.
