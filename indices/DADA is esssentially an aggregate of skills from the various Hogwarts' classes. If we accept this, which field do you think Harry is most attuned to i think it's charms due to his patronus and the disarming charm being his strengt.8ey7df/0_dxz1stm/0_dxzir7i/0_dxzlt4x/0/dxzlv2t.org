I don't really disagree with any of that. Him distrusting the ministry is why I don't believe he'd stay with them for long. I just find it hard to believe he wouldn't at least give it a try. Maybe a few years.

19 years? That's probably too long.

I think, however, that sometimes people confuse Harry wanting a normal life with Harry not liking his fame - mostly because of where it originates from. Even killing Voldemort, in the end, was mostly Dumbledore's plan from the grave, even though he, of course, was the most important part of it.

Achieving recognition for things he does because of his own merit? There's never really anything that showcases that he wouldn't be happy with that.
