No, I agree. Hermione as Minister makes sense. I still don't see Harry Potter staying on as an Auror, specifically, during that time, though. It seems to me that Hermione would want to make some pretty impressive changes - hopefully continuing whatever good path Kingsley had been on.

Head Auror is a good position to be in, but I think Hermione would at least /try/ to convince him to move into a more advantageous position for her administration.
