So you know have a boggart in the cupboard. Congratulations on blocking it forever and rendering it useless (until you force the boggart out, but then you have to deal with it again). And I don't know about you, but there's no way in hell I would keep a mind raping creature (because that is the only way they can find out your worst fear) anywhere near me, even if it is contained.

And locking it in a cupboard doesn't solve the problem at all. It might get out, your children might set it free and get murdered by a chainsaw maniac boggart, the locking charm might wear off... There are so many ways keeping it locked can go wrong. You don't deal with a hornets nest by locking it in a cupboard, you smoke them out with a pesticide.
