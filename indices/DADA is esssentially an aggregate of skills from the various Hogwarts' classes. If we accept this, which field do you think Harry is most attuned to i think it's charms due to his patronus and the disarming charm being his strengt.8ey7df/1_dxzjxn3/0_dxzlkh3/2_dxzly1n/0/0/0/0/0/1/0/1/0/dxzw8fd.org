I'd hesitate to classify Dementors and Basilisks in a list of magical monsters, since they're sapient. (Although there is some debate on whether Boggarts /are/ sentient, too...)

And what are you talking about, no way to deal with them except kill them? It's very much possible to capture and trap a Boggart, as Lupin did to put his Boggart in the cupboard.
