The way they affect people makes them a dangerous pest to be exterminated, much like the smallpox. They have no benefit for anything, thus hunting them to extinction would be a favour for everyone. If they are truly amortal as you say, they serve no purpose in the food chain anyway.

And I guarantee that you can kill them with Fiendfyre. Or Basilisk venom.
