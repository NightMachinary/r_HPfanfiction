Because boggarts are some of the worst creatures in the magical world. Look at Mrs Weasley, a fully qualified witch, completely breaking down over one and now imagine what happens when five year old Sally walks into one and sees her parents brutally murdered. That kid will be scarred for years to come.

And the Room of Requirement is a perfectly safe environment for Fiendfyre pest removal. Cast it into the room, take a step back through the door, slam it shut and you're perfectly safe.

Also, if a dementor boggart makes you faint (and possibly more), boggart Bellatrix Lestrange might very well turn you into a vegetable.
