What? So you think mosquitoes should be allowed to live? The little insects that cause thousands of deaths a year? I don't think that just because something is alive it has value and needs to live, especially if it causes problems for everyone else.

Currently scientists are trying to literally kill every mosquito by making them infertile so they die out. (Do you disagree with this, considering your position that life has inherent value?)
