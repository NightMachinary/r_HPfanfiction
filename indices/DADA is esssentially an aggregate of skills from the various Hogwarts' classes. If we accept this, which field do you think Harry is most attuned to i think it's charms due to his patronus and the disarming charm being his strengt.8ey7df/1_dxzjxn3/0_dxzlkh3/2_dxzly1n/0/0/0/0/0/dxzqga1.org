But that's pretty extreme. Boggarts are /creatures/, not objects --- if there's a nonlethal way to deal with them, ethically, you should probably use that rather than kill them. Same thing as, say, tigers. No one's asking you to like tigers, who will most likely try to eat you, but shooting every tiger you come across is... not okay.

And anyway, I don't think the Boggart is /truly/ affected by its chosen form's weaknesses. Rather, it doesn't have much knowledge on what a Dementor or some such acts like, and so it pulls all its knowledge of what it should act like from the victim's expectations (which is an effect Riddikulus exploits and amplifies to force them to take the amusing form). As a result, if you cast a Patronus Charm at a Boggart who's pretending to be a Dementor, and you /expect/ it to repel the Dementor, the Boggart will stupidly mimick being repelled. And you must remember they're just an illusion: stabbing them with Gryffindor's Sword would probably be akin to trying to stab a cloud.
