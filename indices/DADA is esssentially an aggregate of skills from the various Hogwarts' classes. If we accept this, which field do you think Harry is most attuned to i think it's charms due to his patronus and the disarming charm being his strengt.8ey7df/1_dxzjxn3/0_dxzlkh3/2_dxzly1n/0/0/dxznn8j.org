They mind rape you to materialise themselves as your worst fear. Their entire purpose is fucking with your head. They don't have any uses/benefits, while even a wasp nest can be useful by keeping other pests away. But a boggart is nothing but a horrible pest.

And often they become stuff that looks like your inevitable doom (zombies, giant spiders, magical Nazis, soul sucking demons). Firing lethal magic their way would be common sense, because I'm sure as hell not sticking around to see whether it's really a Death Eater or just a boggart.
