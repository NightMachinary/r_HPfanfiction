It sort of is. It's basically a class on nasties and how to handle them. There's no separate magic skill tree like curses, jinxes, etc. dedicated to it, they just take spells from those lines and apply them to deal with said nasties. The biggest problem with this is the boggart spell. Not entirely sure what its use would be in day to day life.
