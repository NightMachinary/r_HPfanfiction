I adopted some shorter fics for Percy Jackson a few years ago, but I've since discontinued myself from them, as the plot and my writing was rather cringe.

If I have to say anything, just make sure the new author is a decent writer (look at their old works or ask for their ideas) and if you can, volunteer to be a beta and give them your notes.
