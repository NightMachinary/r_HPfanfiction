Sometimes. Not always. Not even often. It also depends on whether or not the original author allows people to adopt the story or not.

Dunuelos made an entire series of fanfics based on The Professional's Lone Traveler.

/Luna's Hubby/ by Meteoricshipyards was based on a oneshot by Rorchach's Blot.

On the subject of Rorchach's Blot, several fanfic authors have made fanfics based on /Make A Wish/.

Those are the only ones I can think of off the top of my head, but I'm sure there's more.
