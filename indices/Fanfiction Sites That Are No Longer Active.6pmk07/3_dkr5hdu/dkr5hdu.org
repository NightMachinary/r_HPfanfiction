[[https://fanlore.org/wiki/List_of_Harry_Potter_Archives]]

As best as I can tell almost every single live journal page, tumblr page, and mailing list, and at least 70 (iirc from checking ~2 years ago) of the archives are completely gone, and, excepting a small handful, the rest are still online but not accepting new submissions. There may be more public groups on Facebook and other social media that weren't listed on fanlore but those are generally small and mostly use ffnet or ao3 to host anyway.
