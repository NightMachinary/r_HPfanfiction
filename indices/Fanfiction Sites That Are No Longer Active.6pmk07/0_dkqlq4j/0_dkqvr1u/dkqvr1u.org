There is a Granger Enchanted Survivors page on Facebook and the admins have a huge amount of stories archived which they make available on request with the author's permission.

They have just begun a new page "Hunting Horcruxes" which is designed for similar content and I believe will also eventually have as much of the Granger Enchanted archive available as possible (based on obtaining permissions etc.)
