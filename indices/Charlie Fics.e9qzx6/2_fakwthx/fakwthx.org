The Sparrow Suite by Red Garden Gnome\\
linkffn(12858961)\\
[Charlie, Hermione]\\
It's unfinished, but the writing is excellent. Also, it's one of the few stories in which Charlie and Hermione don't like each other right off the bat.

Nocturnal by Red Garden Gnome\\
linkffn(12243730)\\
[Charlie, Hermione]\\
It's completed, and about Charlie and Hermione beginning a relationship with each other after the war.

Games are Afoot by Grumpy Grizzly\\
linkffn(3993848)\\
[Charlie, Hermione]\\
A classic Charlie/Hermione staple in its respective community, it's a very well-done story though unfortunately, the latter half of the story (namely the last three chapters or so), feels as if the author simply didn't care to put in as much time or attention as she (?) did to the earlier chapters.

A Pleasurable Kind of Torture by Allotropism\\
linkffn(8417149)\\
[Charlie, Hermione]\\
This is a very good one-shot of Charlie and Hermione that's fun to read every now and then.

Also, sorry that all of my recommendations are just of Charlie and Hermione. But, I do like them as a couple.
