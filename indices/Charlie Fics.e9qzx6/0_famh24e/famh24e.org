Can't remember the name of it, but there's a great one that's Charlie/Oc (slash) in Romania. Iirc the author had created a bunch of OCs in a stand-alone universe involving the twins and their childhood best friend being a muggle. I read it twice in the last year so when I get home I can look it up if you're interested.
