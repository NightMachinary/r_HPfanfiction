This is true. Quill ink was generally iron gall or a derivative thereof, which was /extremely/ acidic. The pH of such inks generally ranges from something like 5 to as low as 2. A modern fountain pen's nib would corrode into a useless lump of flaky trash quite rapidly, and a dip pen with steel nibs wouldn't do all that much better, although the nibs on those are easier to replace at least. Iron gall is however more or less completely permanent. It simply /does not/ wash out or rub off of paper or parchment.

Ballpoints use different kinds of ink (a thick gel that is generally oil based, as compared to the water-based iron gall and modern fountain pen inks) so the ink at Hogwarts would not work. Rollerball pens use water-based liquid ink, but they fall prey to the same fault that nibbed pens do in that the acidic nature of iron gall will corrode it to uselessness very quickly.

Another issue with modern pens using such ink is the pigmented nature of iron gall as compared to the dyed inks used today. A pigmented ink contains a lot of particulate (which gives it its color) but that same particulate will very quickly clog the nib and feed on a fountain pen. The ink is too thick and will also dry too quickly, compounding the issue. A dip pen would have no such issues as there is no feed and as mentioned previously the nib is easily replaced when it gets clogged or corroded.

As a side rant, quills (and dip pens, and fountain pens, for that matter) actually cause your hand to cramp /less/ than a ballpoint because you don't have to push the pen into the paper to get it to write. You can write on soft surfaces without sticking holes in your paper /and/ you can hold the pen at a more natural angle (ever tried to angle a ballpoint? It won't write at an angle lower than about 65 or 70 degrees, and the natural angle will generally be about 55 degrees or so) which puts less strain on your wrist so that, at the end of that lecture by Binns, your wrist doesn't want to fall off.

Quite literally the only real advantages a ballpoint has over a fountain pen or a nibbed pen (which technically, a quill is) is that it doesn't leak as easily and you don't have to carry ink around to refill it when it runs out since it lasts a good bit of time. In terms of long-term usability the nibbed pen will win nearly every time (ever seen a 70 year old ballpoint still being used?). I should also note that quills actually write for quite a good period as the hollow shaft of the feather acts as an ink reservoir. Also, quills can be sharpened with a knife to a new point if the old gets broken.

It's worth pointing out that dip pens only drip on pages when you hold them tip-down over said page. Hold it tip-up and you won't have any issues. :)

So now every time Rowling mentions Harry's hand cramping at the end of a lecture you have an excuse to roll your eyes and snicker.

*TL;DR* I know /entirely/ too much about pens and stationary and now you know why a fountain pen wouldn't work at Hogwarts (it would require modern inks that cannot be purchased in the wizarding world and dip pens would require replacement nibs for when they rusted or wore out). Ballpoints don't write well on parchment so a quill, which holds a fair bit of ink and is easily reusable simply by cutting a new point with a sharp knife, is the best solution.

Huh, this got pretty long didn't it?
