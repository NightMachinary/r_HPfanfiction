In my story, there are several reasons why everyone uses quills and inkwells.

All the special charmed inks (color-changing, etc) cause muggle writing utensils to explode if the ink is inside them. Also, graphite does not write well on the parchment used at Hogwarts so pencils are not a good option. Plus many of the ink-regulating charms placed on quills (to reduce quills from dripping so easily) only work on organic material, not plastics.
