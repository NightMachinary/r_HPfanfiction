There was this fic that came up with a pretty good explanation imo. The headcanon there was that aside from the fact that it is tradition, using a quill instead of a pen or a pencil was crucial in drawing some runes and stuff. Now you could say that not many wizards or witches study runes so it doesn't make sense for all of them to be taught with a quill, but the explanation there was that it was just easier to teach everyone how to use a quill instead of trying to teach people who want to learn runes later. And I actually experienced a very similar thing in my elementary school, where they taught everyone how to write in cursive, even though most of us would never have to use it in our lives. The reason was the same.
