I think it us highly enchantable. The monster book of monster comes into mind. Paper and pens are highly modular(not sure if my English is right) anyway, they are made up of pieces so they break down in presence of magic due to the ambient energy.

I remember where Harry has to charm a muggle pocket book to transfer content to a parchment book since the hardcover and paperback deteriorate just like plastics in the presence of high magic concentration. Parchment and quills are one cohesive organic piece.

Another I remember is when Riddle explains that quills are feathers for the same reason wand cores are feathers, it's magic conductive. If you write, you imbue your magic in it. It's why the torn name of Harry is enough to be accepted by the goblet as him putting his name in by proxyand was asks to latch on to his magic and not the one who put it in. Or why Ritas quill only write what she wish since it's her magic that's linked with the quill and writes what she wants not what is actually said.

Edit: Ps. I just realized I might be thinking of a different fic.
