I have a similar head canon in that first, the quills are form a slightly magical bird that produce durable feathers, second, the "alive and magical" nature of them makes them much more suitable for enchanting them.

It's the same for robes and the like, if magic can take things beyond muggle limits then it's not really "behind the times".
