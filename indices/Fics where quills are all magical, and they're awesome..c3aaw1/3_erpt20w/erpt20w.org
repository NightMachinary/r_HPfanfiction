Just a comment on parchment. It is absolutely crazy, because there may be said something for quills, there is absolutely no reason anybody in year 1700 (or wherever the International Statue of Secrecy was enacted) used parchments any more, it was all paper. I think the only reason why JKR used parchment, was this picture [[https://images.app.goo.gl/DuFRSSmhnwXEEJCt6]] Also, it must be some kind of magical construct not a real parchment, because for each sheet of parchment you need (more or less) one sheep. Can you imagine? And all kids are acting towards that parchment like with paper. You don't make parchment balls from unsuccessful drafts of your writing.
