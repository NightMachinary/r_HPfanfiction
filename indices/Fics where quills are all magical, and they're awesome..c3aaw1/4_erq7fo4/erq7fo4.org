The thing is, if quills don't break then their writing feel on vellum (parchment) would probably be superior to that of any kind of ordinary pen. It's possible that people like Hagrid would want something more grippable, but he and people like him would be the only ones who'd complain.

A self-inking quill and you're done. You probably can even erase things cleanly by scraping the ink off the parchment.
