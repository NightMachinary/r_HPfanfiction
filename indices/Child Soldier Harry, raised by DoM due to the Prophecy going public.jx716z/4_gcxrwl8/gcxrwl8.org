there's a muggle version...sort of. I /think/ i have it in my old ff.net bookmarks so I'll get it later, but essentially Thatcher and Co. get a hold of him, and while it's not straight up 'child soldier', he is placed with a highly ranked (retired?dont remember) soldier, so he grows up with certain values and morals and mindsets instilled. Was an interesting read, iirc. Never got around to the (Tonks centric) sequel.
