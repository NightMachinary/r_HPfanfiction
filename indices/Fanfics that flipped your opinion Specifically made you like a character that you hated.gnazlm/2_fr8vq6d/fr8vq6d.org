Snape

It didn't happen over one fic, though the main turning point was a single fic, it happened over atleast 20 fics.

I previously disliked Snape acting like Harry was his father and being willfully blind to the truth, it was rather childish in my opinion

The main turning point was actually linkffn(severus snape and the art of war) helped by a few Slytherin!Harry stories where Snape was supportive and not an idiot

Currently I like a good Snily story or if Snape plays a part and is well written then I'm rather likely to read it :)
