I learned to dislike Ginny over the span of multiple fanfic. I didn't feel one way or another about her during the books, she was Harry's love interest but I wasn't in the books for the love so I didn't care. She wasn't in the forefront enough for me to have any big opinions.

When I started reading fanfiction I gravitated to what I knew from canon. So I read Harry/Ginny fics. The problem? The Hermione vs. Ginny thing was big, so a lot of fic I read went out of there way to insist that Ginny was this amazing person that was meant for Harry and only she could understand him. And it annoyed the me enough that I actively began to dislike her.

I feel the same about Severitus fics. I like reading a Snape gets to appreciate Harry for who he is fic without the Snape wank or adoption. But I already saw Snape as a dick that was on the good side going into fanfiction and that hasn't changed.
