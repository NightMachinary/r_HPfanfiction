I mean, do we know that for sure? Harry and Co clean Grimmaulds at the Start of OotP, which is as far as i remember more or less the time mundungus steals the locket and sells it. Kreacher dont really specified when he took it, right? Umbridge tortures him during the schoolyear. If im not remembering wrong it could be possible that she already bought the locket and the crew only discovers it way later during the hunt.
