I agree that I don't believe a fic can greatly change my opinion of a character in canon of their canon actions. A well written fic may be able to come up with some alternate/additional rationales for why the canon character acted the way they did but I doubt that would change my underlying opinion of that character.

For instance I think canon Snape by his own actions was a petty, evil, bullying man who could not get over his school rival "getting the girl". And with that pettiness he tormented/tortured the son of his rival (who of course was also the son of the woman Snape supposedly loved. So much for that "love" in torturing her child). IMO Snape's actions by the end of the stories did little to redeem him.

But there have been a couple of stories that got me to like their portrayal of an OOC Snape. (Both are Reptilia28 time travel fics). One story had the Dark Mark being an evil overlay that forces you to take/act on your more negative emotions. This story had the one of the characters find a way to remove Snape's Dark mark and then have him change his attitude. (Changes his appearance, gets a second job doing what he loves (eg developing and brewing potions), and even finds a woman for him).

The fic is The Eighth Time is the Charm by madie080802

The other story completely changes Snape's entire interactions with the other Marauders including allowing Snape to change part of his own family background (in particular not losing his mother due to an abusive husband, and not joining the death eaters).

So bottom line while fics can get me to like a canon character who is OOC, I do not believe they get me to change my opinion of a canon character and his canon actions.
