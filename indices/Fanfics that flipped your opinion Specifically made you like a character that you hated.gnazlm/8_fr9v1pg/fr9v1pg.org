The Sinister Man's /Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin/ ( linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin]]) ) on Umbridge.

While I had disdained bashing before coming across PoS, I obliviously disregarded fanon portrayal of hate sinks---I implicitly didn't consider them worthy of notice or depth. Why bother to put in the effort on them when the author themself didn't? But, as is his modus operandi, The Sinister Man went above and beyond, constructing an intrepid, underdog Dolores that readers find themselves (or at least I find myself) compelled to root for while still being cognizant that her character's trajectory could very well lead to playing a nearly-identical role to her canon counterpart.

Though even back then I believed that fanfiction can add value to a work and its fandom, I'd always though of that as an external, additive thing: a fanfic writer bringing in external ideas, concepts, techniques, &c to replace, modify, clarify, &c parts of the fabric of canon in order to create something of their own. And while there's nothing intrinsically wrong with all those, I didn't see how a fanfic writer could /reconstruct/ elements of canon (or fanon) from the ground up as a creative and storytelling tool. TSM's doing so with Umbridge showed me how that could be done even in the oddest or seemingly trivial of places and the worth of doing so.

tl;dr, even characters the original author bashes themselves (and other aspects of the story they may well have not cared about) are worth examining and utilizing.
