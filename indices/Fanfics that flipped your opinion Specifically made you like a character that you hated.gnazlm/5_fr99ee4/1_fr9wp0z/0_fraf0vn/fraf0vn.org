Coming from a Dumbledore supporter I've always seen him as a distant grandfatherly influence doing what he believed best for the wizarding world.

Don't get me wrong, he did some messed up things. Worst of all, excusing obvious child abuse.

In canon alone, I liked him well enough. But every now and then I'll find a fic where Dumbles shows remorse for his actions. And my heart grows a little fonder each time.

But to each their own. I totally understand why others would see him in less than a spectacular light.
