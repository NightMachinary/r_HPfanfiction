I think my favorite fanfics are the ones where Dumbledore shows genuine remorse for his bad decisions and actually makes up for them.

For all that he apologizes for his shortcomings in the books, it feels like he would say, "Sorry," right before doing the thing he apologized for /again/. Drove me nuts.
