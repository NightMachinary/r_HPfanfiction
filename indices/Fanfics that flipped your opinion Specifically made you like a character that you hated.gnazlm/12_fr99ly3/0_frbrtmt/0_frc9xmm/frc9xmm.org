It is. But the ending was way too rushed. I would have loved reading about strategical warfare and for the war to last several months more. With key figures like muggly military and ICW 'peacekeepers' involved.

I think the author might have rushed it just so that it'd be finished. Which ia good in and of its own, granted.
