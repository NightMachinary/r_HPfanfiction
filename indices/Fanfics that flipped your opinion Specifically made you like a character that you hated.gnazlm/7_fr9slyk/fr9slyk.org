Honestly, it was Snape. Ever since I first read the books I had conflicted feelings about Snape. At age 12 I thought since Harry named his son Albus Severus that Snape was cool. Then, I thought it was a horrible decision and I hated Snape. Then, I started to not like Dumbledore. Now, I read a lot of fanfics and I love reading Snape as a snarky, asshole, good guy. I know he's deeply flawed in canon, but some portrayls of him are just amazing in fanfic (and in canon).

I've learned that I would most likely hate Snape if he was my professor - unless I was on his good side, but as a gryffindor that's doubtful - and I would probably want to throat punch him. But, if I was an adult in canon and roughly his age I would probably really like Snape and just get frustrated at his hatefulness. Snape as a character is just so amazing because he is morally gray. I don't want villains that are supermcevilasshole or heroes that are powerful-sacrificial-bad-decision-makers, I want to argue with people about a character's motives!
