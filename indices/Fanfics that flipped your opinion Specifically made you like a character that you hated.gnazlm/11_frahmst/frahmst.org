Draco in Survival is a Talent. I liked some fanon versions of Draco, sure, but canon Draco was just an annoying bigoted brat to me. But that fic portrayed him so close to his canon counterpart, and his character progression was absolutely brilliant. His conversation with Lupin at the end of the third year especially had me going "Fuck, Rowling really dropped the ball here. Draco is my son and he is precious."
