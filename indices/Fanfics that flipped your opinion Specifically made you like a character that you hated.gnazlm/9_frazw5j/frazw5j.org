Fanfic changed my opinion of Harry. It made me see cannon hp as a Normal Child TM that just wants to chill somewhere and not be bugged. I never really appreciated that facet of Harry's character until I read through the extremes of fanfiction.

In the beginning, I read a lot of OP / smarter / darker Harry fics. Harry was never my favorite character. He was just the protagonist. I didn't really HAVE a favorite character. The fics made me crave a more powerful version of him in cannon. But as I kept reading, powerful!Harry became exhausted and then I ran into the other extreme of the fandom with “beam of light”/“angelic”/Harry that could solve all the wizarding worlds' problems with his sheer force of will and bright disposition. Both AUs and interpretations have fantastic fics and writers.

In the end, that broad survey of fanfiction and exploration of Harry P's alternative characteristics made me more fond of cannon Harry. I never LOVED his character but I appreciate the nuances and willingness to make Harry normal a hell of a lot more now.
