Perhaps if we were able to make judgments on a purely objective level, I would definitely agree, but that isn't the case. Personal biases impact how we perceive things and how we feel about others on some level, even if we try to counteract them or rationalize them. This is certainly true for character interpretations, as many of the major characters in the series have a wide range of depictions within the fandom. Even when using canon as the main bases for interpretation and dropping popular fandom exaggerations, figures like Dumbledore, Snape, and Ron are still so polarizing because of different perceptions based off of canon. Some will always argue that Dumbledore is nothing but a manipulative chess-master using the people around him as human pawns without regard for their feelings, or that Ron is an awful friend who wasn't there when it mattered.

Since a fic by someone else would remove a reader's own biases on how they are written, it's actually possible that something could change someone's opinion on a character without the character exhibiting extremely OOC behavior, as you claim. I'm not trying to claim that fics aren't guilty of widely OOC portrayals, because they often are, but just stating that this isn't always the case, because it isn't.
