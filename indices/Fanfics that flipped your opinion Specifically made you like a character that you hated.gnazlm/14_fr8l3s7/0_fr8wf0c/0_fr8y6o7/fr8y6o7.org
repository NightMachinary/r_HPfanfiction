I guess I should have elaborated in my original comment.

You make a very valid point. Personal bias exists, and it is almost impossible to get rid of it. However, one's opinion changing because of a fanfiction is a clear indication of either OOC behaviour (as I originally stated) or replacement of our own bias with the author's bias.

After all, authors themselves are human, and are not capable of viewing events in a purely objective manner.

I simply feel that while it is wise to take others opinions in view, your own beliefs are based upon what you have experienced.

A purely objective fic which displays a character's canon compliant thoughts sounds like a wonderful chance to have a fresh perspective of what we already know, but it is also not really possible. In some ways, even J.K.R. is incapable of being completely unbiased.
