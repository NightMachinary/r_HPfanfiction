Oh, don't get me wrong, author biases are definitely real. On that point, I completely agree, and wasn't trying to claim otherwise. I mainly meant that fic writers could offer a different lens to view a character, though I should have mentioned that they would still provide a different bias, though I thought it would have been a tad redundant.

As far as just taking others' opinions in view, I'll agree there. I'm actually quite weary of those too easily swayed by the beliefs of others. But knowing how I used to be an extreme opposite for a while, I've since learned that there are times when others can help me see when my own flaws and biases are clouding my perception of things. That's more of a general point than with fan fiction, though it has happened a few times where it's happened in fanfic for me.

It definitely isn't, but it does sound nice. Though I would say that's putting it nicely about J.K., even recent Twitter comments aside.
