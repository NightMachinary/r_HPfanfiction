  However, one's opinion changing because of a fanfiction is a clear indication of either OOC behaviour (as I originally stated) or replacement of our own bias with the author's bias.

I completely disagree with that statement.

What's weird is that you seem to disagree with it aswell, even if it is indirectly stated: In your comment below you say "My own opinion has changed */slightly/* for some characters, but it has shifted to a more neutral view. "

A fic doesn't have to completely replace your previous bias with the author's. It can also show you a new side of a character, something that will allow you to form a slightly more objective view, present you with an interpretation of canon you hadn't thought of before.
