I disagree. Canon skips a lot of major events since it is Harry's POV, and I think writers can fill in the gaps with canon-compliant events/plotting that shed more light on a character.

For example, what was Snape doing 7th year at Hogwarts? How was he treating the students? What went on between him and the Death Eaters that year? How did he treat the other teachers, who viewed him as murderer? These are pretty significant things we don't know from canon, and a story with these bits could easily change someone's opinion on Snape without making him OOC.

Damn, now I want to write a Snape fic covering 7th year, haha.
