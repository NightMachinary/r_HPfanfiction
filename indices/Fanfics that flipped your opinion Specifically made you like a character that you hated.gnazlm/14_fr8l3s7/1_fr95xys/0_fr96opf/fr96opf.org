I understand this, but replacing one's own bias with someone else's bias seems detrimental.

As I stated in another comment, fanfics, or any opinion on a character, comes from one's own experiences. Unless the author is completely neutral and objective, it isn't possible to have a fair view, only a distorted one. And not necessarily a sensible one.
