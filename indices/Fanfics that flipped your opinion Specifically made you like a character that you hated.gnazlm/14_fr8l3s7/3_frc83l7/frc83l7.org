Nope. I disagree. If you see *good* perspective changes, it can change your view.

Remember the trio's plan to:\\
1. Explode a potion and burn people to cause a panic so they can steal ingredients

1. Kidnap 3 people from Slytherin, throw them into a dark closet*, and impersonate them

2. Invade the Slytherin's privacy and gain the ability to go into their common room whenever (even if you won't use it for bad)

It seemed perfectly alright to the trio, didn't it?

Now imagine it from Blaise Zabini's point of view. Yes, he's a bigot, but he's human and although you still may dislike Blaise for being a bigot, you'll suddenly see that the trio were being huge self righteous asses.

I've changed and added a few details, but only because Blaise is mostly OC, we can only speculate what actually happened, and Blaise may not have actually find out who did it. But this could actually be cannon, or quite close to cannon.

Imagine you're Blaise.

One day, in potions class, suddenly, a loud bang happens and you and your friends are covered in hot burning potion. You shield your friend Pansy from most of it by instinct, and your skin burns with excruciating pain. Your ears are ringing and you scream.

From the pain, you don't notice the trio stealing ingredients. You go to the hospital wing, dazed by the accident.

A few weeks later, Crabbe and Goyle suddenly begin acting strangely. After that, you find them on the floor with their robes taken. They tell their story. They give vague descriptions of their attackers, but too vague to find them out.

You are furious. Your friends have been targetted by someone unknown - but who?

You manage to figure out that the prior potions accident must have occured to steal ingredients, for the polyjuice potion. Lucky that you sneakily read that dark tome from your mom's library.

From the clues, and asking around, you find the identity's of the attacker. You are absolutely shaking with anger! THEY'LL PAY. THE SCARHEAD, MUDBLOOD, AND BLOOD TRAITOR WILL PAY!

Your freind, Theodore, manages to hold you back from attacking the trio in a fit of rage. Theo knows that the trio is able to get away with anything for having harry potter on their side, and being Gyrfindors. Theo knows that attacking them will only lead to Blaise being expelled, and he doesn't want that for his friend.

You know that too, but in that moment you didn't, couldn't care!

From then on, you see what your mother meant. Potter really was the wrong kind of person, he truly didn't deserve any respect. From that day on you truly hated him.
