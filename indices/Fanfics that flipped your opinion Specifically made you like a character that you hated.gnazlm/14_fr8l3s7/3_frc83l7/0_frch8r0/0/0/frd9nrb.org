I know, hearing and considering others' opinions constitutes a large part of growing up and fitting in a group full of people with mixed mindsets. But changing one's own opinion on the basis of a single argument/viewpoint would mean either or both sides have their opinions based on a shaky foundation.

That is a form of opinions being influenced, but it's hardly a good example.

I agree with the general idea behind this, but the specific conditions behind such shift in views leave me stuck somewhere in the middle. I can't pretend to fully understand it.
