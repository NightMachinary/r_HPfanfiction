That's why polyjuice potion is in the exact same book as the potion that turns you inside out - I just gag thinking about that.

Still interesting to see other people's perspectives. Especially when they notice something we've overlooked. The reason I enjoy seeing others perspectives (only when it's done with quality though) is the same as people who enjoy debating and talking and learning others opinions with real life topics.

For example, 10 years ago I was a hard and strict anti-abortionist but after coming into contact with other views, I saw how some of the other people's ideas made better sense. You can hold whatever opinion you like, but at the same time isn't it interesting to see, change, or BE changed by other people's viewpoints?
