Dumbledore is the character I have the biggest problem with, though all the same I don't hate him.

I can enjoy a bit of bashing towards any of the characters, but there are a lot of fics that took the bashing so far out of the way of the plot that i had to wonder why they were straying so far just for that extra kick at an already dead horse.

I saw one fic that gave Ron the Death Eater a proper, dramatic turn, and it was believably in character, even! (due to something he got punished for early on, he ended up missing out on key information and even missed a few of the canon "we're still friends!" scenes, until he went into a downward spiral, his jealousy becoming uglier due to misinterpreting Harry and Hermione's status as adoptive siblings as Harry stealing his girl, and he and Harry dueled it out, with Ron screaming Crucio... but nothing happens, because despite bearing the Dark Mark, despite seething with jealousy and a sense of impotency, he still loves Hermione, and he still loves Harry.)
