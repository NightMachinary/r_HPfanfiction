I completely agree with what you just wrote; it was beautifully put. I had started fanfiction reading RobSt or Dramione fics, and that led to a souring of my viewpoint towards Ron as they only ever focused on the things he did that was wrong and played up many instances that weren't. Then I watched a Very Potter Musical, as well as several discussions about the character, and realized that a lot of it stems from his background and that the camaraderie between Harry and Ron is hard to understand as an outsider. He's full of flaws, but also so much redemption, and it's much harder to write that than to just bash him for the sake of Harmony.
