It wasn't one fanfic, and it wasn't a fan fiction per se, at least in written form. But it happened for me gradually with Ron Weasley, coming to a head with the Very Potter musicals.

Let me start my saying I didn't always hate Ron. In the first three books, I was fine with him. He was never my favorite, but he was fine. It was Goblet of Fire were my opinion on Ron started to sour. Just from canon, I thought Harry was a little too quick to forgive Ron after their fight. I realized that Ron's insecurities and jealously were clouding his judgement, but he also knew Harry, and the fact that he was so quick to brush Harry's protests about the danger aside aways bothered me. This moment wasn't the base breaking moment for me, though. That didn't come until Deathly Hallows. But because of DH, when I started reading HP fanfic, I preferred fics that had some Ron bashing in them initially. There were some fics where I could appreciate Ron in a better light, but it wasn't until the Very Potter musicals that my opinion on him changed for the better.

Granted, they are more on the crack-side of things, and it exaggerates a lot of the characters' traits. That said, I think their portrayal of Ron is one of the less extreme changes from canon. I was aware of Ron's canon flaws, to a point where I was hyper-focused on them when reading about him. The musicals reminded me of Ron's strengths as well, though. Seeing how others interpreted him outside of a debate, where I tend to gravitate toward the side I agree with, as well as being able to see him in a more balanced portrayal, with strengths and weaknesses showcased, was crucial to allowing me to see him in a fairer light. He was highly insecure, argumentative, and insensitive, but he was also brave, funny, and fiercely loyal - all of which are canon traits for him as well. Seeing how close Harry and Ron were in the musicals finally made it click how the two were able to stay so close in canon, because I was seeing his characterization through others in a way that pushed my own biases to the side. And it made me realize that part of why I disliked how deeply insecure Ron was was because I had disliked how deeply insecure I was when I was younger, too. Actually, a lot of what I didn't like about Ron stemmed in part from things that happened in my own life, and where that's how Remus became my favorite character, it turned Ron into one of least favorites, if not my least favorite altogether for a time.

While other fan works have also helped me, I've noticed that a good number of fics that I've read where Ron is depicted positively tend to drop some of Ron's worse canon moments (like the fight in GoF, which seems to be pivotal for many when it comes to how they view Ron) altogether. In fact, a lot of those fics also tended to downplay the deep-rooted insecurity he suffers from throughout the entire series, especially after the first couple of years. And I can see how it's so tempting to change Ron's character to be more palatable. But I now think these changes are for the worse, because he loses the depth in his character, something that makes him feel all too real at times. It actually started bothering me when Ron's insecurity was watered down, because that was such an important part of his character and a crucial part of his growth. It's uncomfortable to go to those fights he has with Harry, but that's what makes him coming back so much better.

So, I'm a Ron fan now. And I don't think I would be if it weren't for fan fiction.
