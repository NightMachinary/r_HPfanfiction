I think a lot of people forget that he was /14/ in GoF and even in Deathly Hallows it's a bunch of 17 year-olds putting their lives on the line and also leaving behind everything they knew to do it. I'm not sure what they're expecting out of Ron but he's a kid. You can bet your ass that I wouldn't have left my home, family, comfort, and relative safety to go on a quest against a genocidal maniac when I was 17 because I was a kid. Maturity is a gradual process, and that gradual development tells of Ron being, in my opinion, one of the better characters in canon (see: Mary Sue Hermione).
