Fanfiction has definitely given me opinions about minor characters when before I'm sure I never had an opinion about them. It made me think and care about characters like Oliver Wood, Percy Weasley, and Lavender Brown when before I really wouldn't have paid attention to them. I'm sure fanfiction colors characters differently based on the writer's intent, but I've always been good at separating canon from not (example: I love fanfiction Snape, but canon Snape is awful).
