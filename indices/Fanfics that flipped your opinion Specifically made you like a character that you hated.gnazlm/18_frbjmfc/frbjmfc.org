Probably Tom Riddle/Voldemort, haha. I mean, it's been a while since I've read canon, so maybe my opinion would just be changed right back again, but the fics that sort of really highlight that he was abandoned at an orphanage, he wasn't enough for his mother to stick around for (she was heartbroken about being left by the person she'd statutorily raped), he grew up during WWII and the blitz, grew up lacking in probably basic necessities so of course he'd turn to thievery, any accidental magic would probably have marked him as needing an exorcism back in those days, haha, but most importantly he grew up never knowing any form of LOVE. Which is psychologically what triggers sociopathy/psychopathy anyway (you can have the genetic disposition for it, but have it NOT be triggered). So yeah, just gave me a lot of empathy and a desire for him to be saved or shown something other than Dumbledore setting his only possessions on fire.

For those of you who've seen Cursed Child, the playbook you can buy on the night actually has a good part on comparing Tom Riddle to Harry Potter and how J. K. Rowling says the difference between the two orphans is that Harry knew true love for fifteen months of his life. So I think Rowling probably shares some of the empathy it took fanfiction for me to cultivate lol. It's probably why she started the charity 'Lumos' to get kids out of orphanages.
