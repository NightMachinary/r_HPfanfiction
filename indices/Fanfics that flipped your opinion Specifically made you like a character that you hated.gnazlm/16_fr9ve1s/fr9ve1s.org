Made me enjoy a decent post-war portrayal of Draco and Dramione.

Then I binged lots of other stories in this genre and it brought me all 360 degrees back to hating him and his portrayal in Draco sympathetic fanfic.

So in conclusion, my opinion got flipped and then re-flipped after a few months. Though I couldn't name a single particular fic for the second flip, just a general sense of revulsion and 'ugh'.
