Never really hated any characters (besides Umbridge, but that's a given), but reading stories that bashed Dumbledore or the Weasleys ironically only made me appreciate them more.

The first time I read a story that had Dumbledore bashing I was so confused by the inexplicable “revelation” that he was the bad guy that I went back to canon to try and understand where the writer might be coming from and whether I'd completely missed something in the books. I had not, and over time I began seeing the pattern in the kinds of fics that bashed characters that were undoubtedly good in canon. They all relied on the presence of elements that didn't exist in the books to justify the characters being suddenly evil, such as another powerful figure who could oppose Voldemort and protect Harry, or a different love interest besides Ginny.

I suppose the original fics that started the trend were novel for the surprise twists, if nothing else, but even the better written versions which twisted canon imperfections out of proportion rather than relying on new additions seemed laughably ridiculous to me in how far they had to reach to make the good guys look bad. More often than not, there was no attempt at nuance, all of the good traits that might make the bashed characters redeemable in any way were just tossed out the window and Dumbledore and the Weasleys were made into wholesale villains. It all just seemed like bad writing with no thought behind it other than perhaps a desire to project the author's negative experiences with real life people onto characters that filled a similar role in Harry's story regardless of whether there was any resemblance or not.

I've always preferred fanfics that hew more closely to canon, but I do enjoy AUs that have well-nuanced characters. Seeing the myriad stories that reduce Dumbledore or the Weasleys to caricatures on the level of the Dursleys only made me appreciate the amount of detail and care that went into fleshing them out in canon.
