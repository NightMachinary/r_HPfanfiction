I'm always recommending this but will do so again: The Never Ending Road by Laventadorn has my favourite characterisation of Snape ever. I'm afraid he very much hasn't moved on from hating the marauders but it defo fits your request for a non-sappy Snape. He's certainly quite ruthless at points.

Word of warning - it's long, and the sequel is unfinished. At the moment it's updating roughly every 6 months.
