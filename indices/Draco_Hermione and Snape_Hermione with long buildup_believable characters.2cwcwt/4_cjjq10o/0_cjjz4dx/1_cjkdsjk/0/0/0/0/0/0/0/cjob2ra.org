I stay away from H/Hr also due to crap like that (the incest factor can be worked around if written well). Threesomes can be particularly steamy, but most writers have so obviously never participated in one that it just comes off as embarrassingly bad wish fulfillment... and H/Hr tends to be mostly about embarrassingly bad wish fulfillment as is.

And dammit, Luna is anything but vapid. That's one of the many ways people mess her up. She's suddenly a seer, can read auras, loses that dreamlike quality to her speech, isn't tough as nails, has no positive outlook (ugh, read one where she was a cutter... how OOC can you get?!), and suddenly has a cruel streak a mile wide.

Though to be honest, if one girl from canon is likely to be ok with sexual experimentation it's probably Luna.
