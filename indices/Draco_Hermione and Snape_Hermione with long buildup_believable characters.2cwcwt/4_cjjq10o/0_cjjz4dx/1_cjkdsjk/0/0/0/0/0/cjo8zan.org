Well, I'm one of the rare few that didn't find the twins too appealing in canon. Though in fanon they are particularly annoying. Actually here's my list of characters that I are written badly in fanon:

1. Luna Lovegood. I've read like... 4 fics where they didn't butcher her character.
2. Severus Snape. He's either completely one dimensional, or suddenly made of pure supportiveness and awesome.
3. Sirius Black. He's been 12 years in Azkaban, and was rather unstable before it (he's a Black, damn it). Writers just make him shrug that off in a couple of weeks, or suddenly make him the ultimate father figure.
4. Fred and George. I may not particularly care for them, but that does not excuse how they're butchered in fanon.
5. Dumbledore. Is not stupid. He may be manipulative, but he's not cruel.
6. Hagrid. He speaks in a particular way - if you can't emulate it, don't try.
7. Voldemort. He's /smart/. Everyone seems to forget that.

Those characters in particular are so rarely written well. The top three of the list are IMO the most rewarding characters to read when they are written well, because they are the most complicated ones (which is perhaps a nice way of saying "damaged")... but it's surprising how people mess up even the simplest characters when it comes to humor.
