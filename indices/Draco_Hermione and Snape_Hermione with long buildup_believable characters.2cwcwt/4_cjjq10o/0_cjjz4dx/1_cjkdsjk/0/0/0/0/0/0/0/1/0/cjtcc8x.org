Because reading the books (as opposed to the movies) they give such a vibe of Hermione being the sibling Harry never had and vice versa. Their relationship is super-strong, but it's not in the least bit romantic - hence, it feels like a breaking of a unique trust. It's not literal incest, but this is why it feels like that to me. Unless a story veers way off canon, it just seems so wrong for them.
