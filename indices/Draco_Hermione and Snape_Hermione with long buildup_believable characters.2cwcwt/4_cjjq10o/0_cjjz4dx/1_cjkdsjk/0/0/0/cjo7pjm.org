Things I've encountered in fan fiction that are supposed to be funny:

- gang rape (they thought it was someone else!)
- torture (hahaha, poor Neville lolol!)
- pedophilia (she told me she was 14!)
- incest (those Weasley twins and their shenanigans!)
- slavery (Draco had it coming rofl!)
- genocide (it was accidental!)

Unfortunately, this is an incomplete list. The amount of cringeworthy moments increases in direct proportions with appearances of Sirius and the twins, and inverse to the skill of the author.

tl;dr: some people don't know how to be funny so they go for shock value because they can't tell the difference.

tl;dr's tl;dr: some writers are hacks.
