On the subject of Luna [[/u/truncation_error]] pretty much summed up how a lot of authors see her complex character.

  One of my biggest pet peeves in fanfiction is so-called "Luna flakes": take a hetero pairing, say Harry/Hermione, sprinkle over wish-fulfillment kink sex with Luna, and there you go: extra spice. It's boring. It's been done to death. And it's both wholly unbelievable polyamory and degrading to women, who deserve better than to have one of the more interesting characters of their gender portrayed as little more than a vapid fucktoy with a sub fetish. More broadly, so few writers can pull off writing Luna competently that I wish they wouldn't bother.
