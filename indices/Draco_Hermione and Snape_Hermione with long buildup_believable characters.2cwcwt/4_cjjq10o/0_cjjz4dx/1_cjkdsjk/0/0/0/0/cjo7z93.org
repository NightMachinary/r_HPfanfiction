Your tl;dr pretty much summed it up and to an extent, adding that extra shock value in a fanfiction can boost the gritty realism, but when you're reading a jovial fanfiction and then suddenly Boom, Draco is raping someone in a casual way it makes you wonder what the fuck is going on!

I might do a separate thread to talk about these ideas properly because after dropping a fanfiction for the fifth time due to adding casual rape scenes it starts to really irk at you.

Edit: i would definitely prefer to not go into one of the biggest and most annoying atrocities in fanfiction that is the portrayal of +Fred and George+ Gred and Forge Weasley (which almost every bad fanfic will call them) if you look through my post in HPFanfiction then you'd understand the hatred I now have for their fanon portrayal. Ranging from their *absolutely fucking annoying bullshit PING PONG STYLE SPEECH* to their general one dimensional characters.
