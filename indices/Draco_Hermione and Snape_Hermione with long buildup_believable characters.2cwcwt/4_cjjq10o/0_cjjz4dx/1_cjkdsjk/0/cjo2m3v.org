I nope'd the fuck out of a Sirius/Hermione one where Sirius "humorously" rapes a twelve year old Hermione.

In general, Sirius/Hermione and Sirius/Harry creep me out because Sirius is a father figure to Harry, and Hermione may as well be Harry's sister in my book. Remus/Hermione and Remus/Harry less creepy, but still somewhat so. I'm also uncomfortable with HHr due to the incest-factor, but sometimes those are just well written.
