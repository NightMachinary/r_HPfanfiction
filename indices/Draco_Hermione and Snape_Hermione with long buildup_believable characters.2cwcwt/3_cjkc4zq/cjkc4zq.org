I remembered a few more that I really enjoyed.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7453087/1/Pride-of-Time][Pride of Time]] by Anubis Ankh\\
[[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=20534][The Problem with Purity]] by Silver Birch

Admittedly, it has been a while since I read either of these stories so they may not be quite what you've requested. The former is a Time Turner fic (/I know, I know!/), but I remember it as addictive. I'm pretty sure that the latter story ends up mushy, but there's quite a bit of miscommunication along the way. Enjoy!
