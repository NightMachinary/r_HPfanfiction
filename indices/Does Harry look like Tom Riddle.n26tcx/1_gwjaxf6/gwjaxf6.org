Yes and no? In CoS, Tom Riddle mentions, among other similarities that even look a bit alike. But it's not like they are clone of each other and even Tom talk less of their physical ressemblance than their mental one (smart, ambitious, a little disregard for rules . . .).

I think they only look alike because they are both attractive boy with a similar shade of hair. Someone looking for it may find some similarities between them, but it's not like they could be mistaken as brother or something like that.

As for Harry's skin color, a part of the fandom like to consider Harry of Indian descent (just like some think Hermione is Black). Rowling never clearly said that Harry was white, so I guess it's open to interpretation. I personally belive that Harry and Hermione are white (Rowling always specified it when a character was from a minority, which make me thinks than any character with an unspecified skin color is white), and even a bit pale at that, there can't be that much sun in Scotland.
