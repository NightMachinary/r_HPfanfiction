I think it's mostly fanon.

I guess when they say they look alike, it probably means something like they've got the same hair color shade.

Young Tom Riddle's eyes were described as dark brown, which is very far from Harry's own green eyes.

I don't think they look that much alike, even their personalities are so different, don't believe what fanon tells you. ðŸ˜­

I still get confused what's fanon and what isn't. ðŸ’€
