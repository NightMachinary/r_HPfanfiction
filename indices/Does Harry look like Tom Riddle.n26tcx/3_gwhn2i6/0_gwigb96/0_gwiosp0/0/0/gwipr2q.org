Well, I don't know, we simply don't have enough information. Feel free to interpret it how you want to, literal or metaphorical. This [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Voldemort#Outward_appearance][link]] and this [[https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Muggles%27_Guide_to_Harry_Potter/Characters/Tom_Marvolo_Riddle][one]] are both wikis that describe Tom Riddle's eye color as dark. I could send you 3 links that are also talking about this eye color topic but there's no definite confirmed answer.

JKR needs to end these discussions and give us a proper answer lmao. ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜‚
