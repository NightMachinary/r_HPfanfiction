I think it was seen through the flashbacks in the CoS and HBP. He was described as tall with pale skin, jet black hair, and dark brown eyes. Here's a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Voldemort#Outward_appearance][link]] to the wikipedia page that describes Voldemort's appearance.

And also in chapter 20 in the Half Blood Prince, his eyes were described as dark.

/Harry thought he saw a red gleam in his dark eyes./

Anyway, even if it wasn't dark brown, it's still dark compared to Harry's green eyes. So either way, their eyes wouldn't have looked alike.
