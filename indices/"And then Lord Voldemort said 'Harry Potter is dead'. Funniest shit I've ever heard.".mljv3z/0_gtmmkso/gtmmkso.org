Ummm. Seems like this post might be incomplete. A little more detail could go a long way here. Cause i could see it going multiple ways here. All depending on who sasy it and how it's said.

Bellatrix could be like:*"And then Lord Voldemort said 'Harry Potter is dead!'. Funniest shit I've ever heard."* How could that pathetic Half-Blood ever think he could stand up to Our lord and have a chance of winning. We all knew that he was nothing and he died as nothing.

OR

Harry could be like: *"And then Lord Voldemort said 'Harry Potter is dead!'. Funniest shit I've ever heard."* And then I took that Personnaly and said nope. Came right back to life again. I waas like Yo tom? Having a little 'wand' trouble in your old age? Maybe you should hate muggles less, they got Pills for that!
