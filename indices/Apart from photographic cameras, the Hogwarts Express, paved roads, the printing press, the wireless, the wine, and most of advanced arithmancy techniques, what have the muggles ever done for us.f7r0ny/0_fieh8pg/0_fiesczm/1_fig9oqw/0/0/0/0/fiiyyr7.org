It's true that we can't perfectly determine the population based on Hogwarts students and previous civil war baby boom/bust records (especially since with numbers like that, one family blessed with twins or triplets throws the whole year off), but we can get a damn good ballpark. The fact that Hogwarts is the only school that sends a letter to Harry is pretty telling to me, as is the fact that Hogwarts is such a politically significant cornerstone in Wizard Britain. The headmaster rivals the Minister for influence, everyone in the Ministry knows all the teachers by name, all the pureblood families are going there alongside all the muggleborn children... the impression I get from this is that Hogwarts is the only magical school in Britain, and if there are other magical schools, they're set aside for people who specifically opt for them and don't have a lot of prestige. Magical special education, maybe, or schools for squibs. Either way, it seems like all the magical adults we meet from Britain have gone to Hogwarts, which says to me that, if there are magical special education schools, they aren't popular, and neither is sending a British witch or wizard to another country's school.

Let's be generous and say fifteen young witches and wizards get sent to other schools or homeschooled every year. Going with the forty-per-Hogwarts-year, that would bring up our birth rate to fifty-five per year, with 27% of all British witches and wizards getting a non-Hogwarts education, and for various reasons, that population isn't in a position to be in extended contact with Harry so he has no idea these other methods of education in the magical world exists. Personally, I think it's a stretch for nearly a third of the magical population to have gone somewhere other than Hogwarts and for Harry to not have heard about it. I think that it would be more realistic if there were only a handful of wizards every year who did, like two or three, but it would explain what happens to wizards and witches who are born with learning disabilities or special needs that can't be adequately addressed with magic.
