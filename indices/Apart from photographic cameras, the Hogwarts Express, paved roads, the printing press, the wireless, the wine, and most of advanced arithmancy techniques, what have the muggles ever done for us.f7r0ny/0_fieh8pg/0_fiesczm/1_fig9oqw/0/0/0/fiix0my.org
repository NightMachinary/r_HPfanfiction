This is also implying that every single wizarding child goes to Hogwarts. I believe Draco mentions that his father initially wanted to send him to Durmstrang, which whether he was lying to brag or not suggests that British children don't /have/ to go to Hogwarts. And the big 3: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang, aren't necessarily the only schools in Europe, just the ones involved in the Triwizard. So there could be multiple other options, including home-schooling, private tutoring, smaller schools (or just other British schools in general), and other European schools that they can go to.

I don't know what JKR or Pottermore has to say about this, but since you're only focusing on what's in the books so am I, and the books say that there are schools open to British children other than Hogwarts. Since we have no idea how many there are or what percentage of British students do go to Hogwarts, it's impossible to determine the actual population based on the number of Hogwarts students and post-American Civil War birth rates.
