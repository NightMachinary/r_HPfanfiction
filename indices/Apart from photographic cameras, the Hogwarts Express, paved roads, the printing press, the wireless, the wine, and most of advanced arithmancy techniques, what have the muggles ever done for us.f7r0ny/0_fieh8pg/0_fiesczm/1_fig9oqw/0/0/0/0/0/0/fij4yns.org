This is a conflict between British and American culture, I think. British kids have historically (and currently) gone to boarding school much more than American kids. In Britain, it's not as much of a stretch to imagine sending your child away to school for a year as it is in America (and I speak as a former boarding school student).

But even so, I think the argument still stands that given how few people it would take to significantly change the percentage of people who went to Hogwarts vs somewhere else that Harry would meet, I think it's a stretch to think that there are a lot of people using other educational options and Harry didn't hear about any of them in seven years.

I agree that the book doesn't really reflect a large population, which is part of why I feel comfortable with the '~40 babies per year' figure, as ridiculously minuscule as it seems. ~4000 people seems to me like it's enough to cover Hogsmeade, Godric's Hollow, a smattering of wizard households on the countryside, and the wizards who live in London (or at least the ones who commute there for work). It's a struggle to think of what they all actually do, though, and it looks like the main employers in the wizarding world are Diagon Alley, St. Mungo's, and the Ministry. (Maybe that's why Charlie left the country.)
