  The fact that Hogwarts is the only school that sends a letter to Harry is pretty telling to me
#+end_quote

Hagrid tells the Dursleys that Harry has had his name written down for Hogwarts since he was born. This suggests that his parents signed him up for Hogwarts before they died, and that's why he only received a letter from them.

  as is the fact that Hogwarts is such a politically significant cornerstone in Wizard Britain
#+end_quote

That's more likely due to Dumbledore running it, a political figure who ends up butting heads with the Minister, and it being well known as the best (and assuredly most popular) wizarding school in Britian, so it would seemingly hold education of the future of wizarding Britain.

As for most people we see going to Hogwarts, we only see things from Harry's perspective. His friends' families would have obviously gone there, since if two parents went to the school and think it's the best then they'd want their kids to go there. That can be expanded to entire families sending their kids there over generations. We really don't hear much from other people, though. There are plenty of Ministry workers, and some Order members and Death Eaters, who we don't know about. It's possible they all went to Hogwarts, or maybe only the ones whose families we know go there.

Something I'm surprised you didn't mention is that Hogwarts is responsible for introducing Muggle-borns into their world rather than the Ministry. Although this could possibly be due to Dumbledore's political influence, and so the Ministry allows Hogwarts to handle those cases. Either way I feel like there would have to be other options for families who were weary about sending their kids off to some boarding school in Scotland with these strange people they've never met, and only be able to see their kids on holidays and only communicate with them via mail, not even over the phone. So I would think the private tutoring or a small day school would have to be available for these cases, unless the wizards just manipulates the parents with magic, or obliviates everyone and risks the Muggle-born becoming an Obscurus or something. I'd imagine there are also wizarding families who would choose to see their kids every day over sending them off to boarding school.

But, again, I really don't think we have enough info to go on to really know or even guess accurately as to how big the population. JKR wrote it through Harry's eyes, so that's one limitation to our knowledge, and she never really gave us a true scope as to what the world was like. Hell, if we just go by who's in the Order, who's a Death Eater, and count up the named Aurors, the whole war against Voldemort is like 20-50 people on each side. The HP books really don't seem to give us an accurate representation of the wizarding world at all, or, if it does, there's far less than 1000 people in Wizarding Britain.
