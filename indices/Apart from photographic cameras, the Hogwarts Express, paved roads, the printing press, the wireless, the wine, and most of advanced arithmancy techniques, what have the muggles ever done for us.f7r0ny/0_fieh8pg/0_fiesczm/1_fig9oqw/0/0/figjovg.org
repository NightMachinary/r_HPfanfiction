JKR says a lot of things that contradict themselves. For all her wonderful skill in writing, she's not a very consistent worldbuilder. I take what's written in the book, and what's written in the book is that Harry has about 33 people in his year.

I did to the math on baby booms and busts and how a civil war could have affected the birth rate, too. The most accessible numbers for a birthrate affected by civil war were from the American Civil War. Using the percentages from that, I did the math and puzzled out that, assuming that the 33 was actually from a baby bust, then the average wizard birth rate is actually around 37-40 babies per year. Even if you wanted to be generous and say that all the original forty were in his year whether or not the book mentioned them, the average non-war birth rate would still be between 45 and 50 babies.
