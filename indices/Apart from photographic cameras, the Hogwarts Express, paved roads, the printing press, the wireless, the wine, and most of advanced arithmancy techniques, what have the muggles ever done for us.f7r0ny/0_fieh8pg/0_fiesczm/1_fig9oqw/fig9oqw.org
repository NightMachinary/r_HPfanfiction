People don't like acknowledging that muggles may actually be necessary for wizard life. They don't like acknowledging that muggles could be influential or possibly even better than wizards at something at all.

Taking the number of people in Harry's year and using it to extrapolate the general wizard population, there's ~4000 wizards in the entirety of Britain. We hear nothing about their agricultural industry, and it's implied that there isn't one by the fact that 'farmer' is never brought up as a job possibility in the only school for wizards in Britain. People seen managing animals are managing them specifically for animal control or magical purposes (like harvesting dragon hide for cloth or just as a hobby in Hagrid's case), and Professor Sprout is never shown teaching how to sustainably grow, manage, and harvest food crops. As far as we know, there isn't even an elective for that, and we've been told before that it's not possible to conjure edible food from thin air.

So this implies that the wizarding world is heavily dependent on muggle agricultural infrastructure. It seems that they're also dependent on muggles for technological advancements (like plumbing, trains, etc.) and infrastructure (since we also don't hear about wizards physically building things like bridges or even houses). Wizards would probably be screwed if muggles disappeared one day.
