That's what convinces me that wizards are often settling in buildings that were already built a long time ago, probably by muggles. To Harry, the Weasley house was visibly magical, and it was probably literally held together by magic. There aren't any other buildings save for the Ministry and Hogwarts that's described as visibly magical, though--everything else may be modified with magic, but it seems like every other building in London. We see that the Weasleys have put together a building with magic, but for some reason, it doesn't look like any other family did that, and I suspect it's because buildings made by hand rather than magic are less temperamental (Hogwarts keeps switching up stairs and the Burrow has a ghoul in the attic). But construction is a skill, and wizard Britain doesn't seem to have the population and growth to sustain an actual construction industry, so that makes me think that they outsource by just settling into buildings that muggles already built and modifying it to suit their needs.
