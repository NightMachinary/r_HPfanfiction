How many houses do we actually see? Luna's home is almost definitely built with magic, as it looks like a rook. Hogsmeade is an entirely wizard town, they presumably don't bring in muggle construction crews and then later obliviate them.

It's really short sighted, imo, to believe that witches and wizards are incapable of something as simple as building dwellings when they can bend and break the laws of reality.
