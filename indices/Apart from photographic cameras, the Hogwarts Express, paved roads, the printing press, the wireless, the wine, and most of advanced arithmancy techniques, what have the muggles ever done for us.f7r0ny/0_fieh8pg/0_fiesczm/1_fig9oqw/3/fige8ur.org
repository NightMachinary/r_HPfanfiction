That argument is completely nonsensical though. I'm pretty sure [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_ignorance][it's a logical fallacy,]]

Just because we don't hear about those things from the perspective of a literal child, doesn't mean muggles do all those things. You think muggles built Hogwarts? Every wizarding home? The Burrow? Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley?

You know what we also don't see? Muggles doing all that stuff for wizards. Therefore, by your own logic, it doesn't happen. See how silly that is?
