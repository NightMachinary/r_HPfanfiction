So you can go on a long personal tirade against me, putting words into my mouth, making things up, deflecting away from my original argument, but I can't curse?

You can accuse me of going blue faced in anger, acting crazy, but I can't accuse you of downvoting me? It's just someone else who downvotes every one of my comments precisely one minute before you reply /each time/?

It's whatever. Downvotes aren't a big deal, not sure why I even care. I think I was just bothered that I've written out long comments explaining my beliefs in canon to you multiple times, and I always get nothing but a downvote and silence in the end.

It's just downputting. Imagine explaining your beliefs to someone only for them to basically flip you off and walk away. It's seriously rude.

Take this [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/f26s44/the_existence_of_magic_has_been_revealed_to_the/fhg8x02][example]], where you imply our governments haven't ever hurt children in the real world. Then when I provide numerous examples of how horrible the real world has been to children, you just downvote me and leave.

Was I a bit aggressive there? Sure, but part of that was anger at our governments for killing so many innocents. And part of it was just exasperation that you seemed to disagree and think the Tri Wizard Tournament was somehow worse than the literal raping and killing of innocent children.

But fine. I can see now you never had a plan of being genuine. I've gotten nothing but personal attacks, downvotes, deflections, projection, and gaslighting from you.

I know that's a lot of buzzwords, but that's what it is. I'll be blocking you. No need to respond, I won't see it. It'll do us both some good, I imagine.

Edit: Made sure to edit out those few curse words from before. I'll try to seem more civil in the future with other users, and I hope you stop being a jerk to people too.

But I think I'm done with this sub. I see far too much of this downvoting and being disingenuous assholes to each other.
