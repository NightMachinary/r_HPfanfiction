That is an insane amount of projection.

/I/ keep making wild assumptions? What the hell? You're the one concluding that muggles built wizarding homes simply because we don't see wizards built them themselves. This is absolutely ridiculous logic. It's a logical fallacy.

  And then you go on every popular post I've seen about the relationship between muggles and wizards and argue

I see your comments on those posts too.

  denying basic human needs

I never once denied they had basic human needs. I'm denying that they aren't capable of producing food themselves. Especially given, you know, it's canon that they can multiply or enlarge food.

Don't put words into my mouth.

  What is interesting about world where one people are unquestionably and forever superior and there's no nuance or complication or facets?
#+end_quote

You literally just said that wizards would die off without muggles. What nuance is there in that? What nuance is there in wizards being 100% dependent on muggles?

You're here trying to paint me as unreasonable, but you've done nothing but use logical fallacies, put words into my mouth, and downvote me.

Your whole comment is just one huge projecting deflection to ignore my criticisms against your first comment.
