I don't understand you. You keep making weird wild assumptions about the power of wizards, to the point of denying basic human needs and logical conclusions one can draw about their society, to maintain this idea of wizards as demigods completely independent and superior to muggles in every way. And then you go on every popular post I've seen about the relationship between muggles and wizards and argue until you're blue in the face about it.

Why? What is interesting about world where one people are unquestionably and forever superior and there's no nuance or complication or facets? What about that seems like good writing or gives the potential for fun story telling? Why does it matter so much that you have to try to argue constantly about how your assumptions about a fictional world are more valid than someone else's assumptions about a fictional world?
