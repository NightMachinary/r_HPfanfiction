Completely ignoring the logical fallacy of "if we don't see wizards do it, then it must be attributable to Muggles": it's simply factually inaccurate that we're not told about wizards growing food.

1. We see Hagrid growing giant pumpkins, indicating that magic is capable of significantly magnifying food production compared to Muggle farming.

2. We know that the Malfoys' wealth comes from the award of land made to them by William the Conqueror, and the way you extract an income from land (especially in the era we're talking of) is farming.

Given wizarding population, and the ability of magic to augment production, one or two wizarding farms are probably enough to feed the whole of wizarding Britain.
