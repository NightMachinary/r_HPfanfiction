Hagrid is seen growing giant pumpkins, but how many of those pumpkins are going into the kitchen to be prepared for students and how many are being used either as Halloween decorations, personal use, and/or magical creature chow?

You make a point about the landed gentry thing, but I think it's more accurate to say that the way you extract an income from land is by charging rent. I've worked on farms, and unless you're a massive farming conglomerate with a nationwide distribution network, it's a struggle to turn any kind of profit as a farmer. The landed gentry of Britain were mainly wealthy because people had to pay taxes to them for the privilege of living on (and farming) their land, and once upon a time, those taxes were usually paid in the form of sacks of grain and other foodstuffs farmed from the land.

Modern 'landed gentry' still make money the same way: by making people pay to use their land, usually as homes. It's just that these days, most people aren't depending on their own farms to feed their families, so now those who own land can generate more income because they don't have to worry about leaving enough space for people to farm; they can squish a whole ton of dwellings together and charge the same rent on each dwelling that they would have charged to one acre of land hundreds of years ago. I think that it would make more sense financially for the Malfoys to have become major landlords of the wizarding world (maybe they own a magical town like Godric's Hollow or Hogsmeade) and for the wizard world to outsource food production to muggles.
