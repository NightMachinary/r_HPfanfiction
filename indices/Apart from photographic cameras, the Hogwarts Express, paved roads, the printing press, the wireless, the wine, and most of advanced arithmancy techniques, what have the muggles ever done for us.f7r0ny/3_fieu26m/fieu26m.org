I'd be curious to see that in an A Wonderful Life-esque fic. If Magicals outbred/killed muggles like we outbred/killed neanderthals, then what would the world look like if Magicals were the only humans around from the very beginning? Anything Muggle after about 40,000 years ago was just never a thing. It'd be interesting to see a professional perspective on how that hypothetical might turn out.
