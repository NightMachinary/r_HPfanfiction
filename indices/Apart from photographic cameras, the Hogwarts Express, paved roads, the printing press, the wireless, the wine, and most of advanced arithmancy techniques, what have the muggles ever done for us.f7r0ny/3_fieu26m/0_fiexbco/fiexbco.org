The magical population would be a bit higher, but it'd probably be well below today's muggle population because contraceptive charms. Magic would be advanced more but the scientific understanding of how the universe works wouldn't be as advanced. Probably a bit more Renaissance style but almost everyone wealthy enough for a comfortable lifestyle. No automation or mass production, so complicated gadgets stay a hand-made novelty for the rich. Simple things are easily duplicated with magic so there's no scarcity of those things. Books probably still handwritten and charm-copied instead of printed. Less advanced metalworking, instead enchanted basic materials.
