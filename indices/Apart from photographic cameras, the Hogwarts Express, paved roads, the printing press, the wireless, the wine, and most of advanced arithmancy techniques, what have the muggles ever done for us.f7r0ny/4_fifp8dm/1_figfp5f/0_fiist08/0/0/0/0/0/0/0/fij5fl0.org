I feel like this conversation went in a weird direction. My original point was that wizards arrogantly dismiss muggles while their society remains static, and muggles have increasingly threatening capabilities that thus could one day overthrow them if they're not careful. Why are we talking about unsustainable environmental policies and rape? Moreover, why are we calling the clear exploitation of labor from slaves not slavery?

As for the wizard vs muggle stuff, like I said, I can think of a few different scenarios if muggles were patient and clever enough. Who's to say muggles don't have spies in the wizard world? They told Cold War-era leaders about their society, and it'd be easy enough for a spy to move in and say they're a Squib from a foreign nation and would you be so kind as to show them around?
