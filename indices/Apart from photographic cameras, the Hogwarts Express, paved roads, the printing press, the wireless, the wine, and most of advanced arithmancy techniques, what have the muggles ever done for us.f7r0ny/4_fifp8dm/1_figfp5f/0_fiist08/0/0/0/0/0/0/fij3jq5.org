Oh, wizard society is not butterflies and rainbows for sure. But in the end, they still aren't destroying the planet for short term gain. Wizard logic is that these 'undesirables' shouldn't exist and should be put away, and less slavery and rape. It's not right, but it's also not using these undesirables as a stepping stone for better things.

  As for muggles vs. wizards... there are ways to defeat forces that have more firepower and skills than you. History is littered with them. It usually just takes a lot of cleverness, and I can think of a few different scenarios where muggles could take advantage of wizarding society's weak points to take their magical capabilities out of the game. All it would take is muggles taking the time to learn about wizards before letting the wizards know that they know about them.

Do not forget that there was a wizard protecting the PM and he didn't even know about it. It shows that wizards are already in the muggle government keeping an eye out. I doubt muggles could ever get a drop on wizards. That and with their spread out rural population or smack in the middle of London...

If America can't even stop terrorists in the ME, how do you think we could stop wizarding terrorists in our borders each armed with a massive atomic bomb?
