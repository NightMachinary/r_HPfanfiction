They did take decades to develop and commercialize, but that goes to my original point: muggle capabilities expand exponentially while wizard capabilities remain mostly static. The biggest innovations we hear about in wizard culture are +not shitting themselves anymore when muggles have already invented plumbing forever ago+ the creative use of radios to send coded messages during the war. An important innovation that could lead to wider cultural implications if people pick it up more after the war, but one that's almost a hundred years out of step with muggles and dependent on an invention muggles already created. We don't see a lot of similar innovation--it seems like most major facets of wizard life were invented a few hundred to even a few thousand years ago and didn't change much since then.

Muggles meanwhile have been inventing new things constantly and gradually getting closer and closer to the quality of life that wizards had from the get go. If I were in the Minister's shoes, I would consider this a cause for concern, because wizarding society is dependent on their ability to circumvent muggle society, and that becomes harder and harder the more powerful muggles become. But the Ministers we see generally dismiss muggles entirely, ranging from paternalism to contempt, and none of them seem to actually consider that maybe muggles could ever outpace wizard capabilities and pose a real threat to wizard society. The fact that they are so assured of this that they won't even learn about something like electricity opens up an opportunity for muggles to grow beyond wizarding capabilities unfettered and eventually take them down should they be discovered and war declared.
