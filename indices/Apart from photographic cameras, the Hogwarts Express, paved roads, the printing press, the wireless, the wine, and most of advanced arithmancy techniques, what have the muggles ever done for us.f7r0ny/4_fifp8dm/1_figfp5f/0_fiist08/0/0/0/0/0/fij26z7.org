We get a sense about the timeline of wizard capabilities from things like paintings, Hermione talking about Hogwarts history, and Professor Binns. It seems that most of the recent inventions we hear about are usually relatively minor, like inventing new ways that dragon hide can be used or discovering a new potion that's good for niche uses. The big things, like portkeys and wands and apparition, seems to either be confirmed thousands of years old or treated as so everyday by ghosts and paintings that it's likely they were around when the ghosts and paintings were made.

As for commentary on wizard society... wizard society is literally built on slavery, and it's implied that it veers dangerously close to apartheid. The wizard economy is based almost entirely on goblins, who are legally discriminated against and we do hear about legislation considered in the Ministry (and possibly legislation that had previously been passed) that specifically targeted people who were 'halfbreeds' and effectively criminalized interspecies relationships. The absence of pure goblins in any space besides the banks implies that there's probably job discrimination against them as well that's widespread enough that it might be legally enforced, and it's illegal to give them a wand and teach them how to use it, effectively disabling them against wizards. And this is to say nothing of house elves and how Britains biggest (and probably only) educational institution is dependent on their labor, or the ways that other intelligent and feeling creatures are legally pigeonholed into certain jobs convenient for wizards. Don't try to paint wizard society as any more moral or stable than regular ol' Britain.

As for muggles vs. wizards... there are ways to defeat forces that have more firepower and skills than you. History is littered with them. It usually just takes a lot of cleverness, and I can think of a few different scenarios where muggles could take advantage of wizarding society's weak points to take their magical capabilities out of the game. All it would take is muggles taking the time to learn about wizards before letting the wizards know that they know about them.
