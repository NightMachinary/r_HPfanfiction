We have no idea when certain spells were invented, so we have no idea if wizard capabilities are static.

  Muggles meanwhile have been inventing new things constantly and gradually getting closer and closer to the quality of life that wizards had from the get go.

Are they? Our whole western way of life is based on the exploitation of those poorer than us. Look how we still rape Africa for resources to fuel our technology, how we allow China to get away with genocide because they mass produce our goods. Look at the children starving around the world, while the Weasleys, one of the poorest families at Hogwarts as a better quality of life than America's lower middle class. Our whole society is climbing a cliff on a verge of collapse.

Wizards have had the Swedish Welfare system for generations without risking the planet. All wizards have to do is wait out our collapse at this rate.

  The fact that they are so assured of this that they won't even learn about something like electricity opens up an opportunity for muggles to grow beyond wizarding capabilities unfettered and eventually take them down should they be discovered and war declared.

I'm not going to get into a muggles vs wizard war debate except to say this... unless muggles find a way to nullify magic (and this means the magic is based on physics when Rowling herself says its not. Ala power of love), they will be fucked. No amount of technology can prevent a wizard from appearing next to the PM/President, imperio'ing him and then disappearing.

Just look how easy it was for Voldemort to gain control of the Ministry of Magic... and these were Wizards.
