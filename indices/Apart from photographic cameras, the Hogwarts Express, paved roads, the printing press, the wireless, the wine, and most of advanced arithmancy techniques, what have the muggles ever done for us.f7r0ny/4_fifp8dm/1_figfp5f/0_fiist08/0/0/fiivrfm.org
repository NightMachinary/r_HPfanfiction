But all these technologies we are talking about took decades to develop to what we use them for now.

In the 90s when Muggles were building the internet, there was never a need in the wizarding world because everyone could just meet up at a specific location and talk in person. I'm certain the internet would have never developed if we had that ability. It is the same with phones. Why develop the telephone when you could Floo chat and see the person with whom you are talking.

If diaries and maps can write back to you, I'm sure devices similar to text messaging were common place. It was just Harry didn't need them as all his friends were in the same school as him.

Wizards could have gone to the moon ages ago, found it a lifeless husk and left it at that. They could be far beyond what we are with placement of the moon and stars than we are now. We have no idea. Moreso, perhaps it wasn't British wizards who went to the moon?

While apparation can only take you places you have been before. Floo travel and Portkeys can take you farther. International portkeys are a thing, and again... far better than airplanes or trains. Again, Satellite imaging would be never even thought of because there would be little use for its basic purposes. It would never be invented. Instead you would have systems such as HP underage magic. Being able to detect something the moment it happens country wide. That is even more powerful than satellite imaging.
