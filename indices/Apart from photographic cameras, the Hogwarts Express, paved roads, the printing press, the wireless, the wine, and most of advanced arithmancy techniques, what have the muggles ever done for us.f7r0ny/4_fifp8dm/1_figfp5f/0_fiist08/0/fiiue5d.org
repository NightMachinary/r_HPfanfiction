Whether or not physics could explain magic within the fictional universe is just a matter of interpretation, but if we're going to try to deconstruct and build on JKR's world in interesting ways, it's best to try considering how it fits in real world rules. For the sake of this, let's say that physics /can/ explain magic, even if no one has discovered how yet. This gives the potential for clever people to explain it and harness it in new and interesting ways.

The Internet also allows for more than the equivalent of popping over to your coworker to chat. Look at us now. Two perfect strangers who know nothing about each other's lives who very well could be on opposite ends of the Earth, talking about a fictional world from a book we've both read. The power of the Internet is in its ability to connect strangers, and thus its ability to spread ideas and galvanize movements for better or for worse. Wizards have no equivalent for this. The best they have are letters you could write to magazines or newspapers, and those are vetted and controlled by said magazines and newspapers.

As for space travel, if wizards had been to the moon, I'm pretty sure we would have heard something about it, especially when Harry stumbled through the Department of Mysteries and ran roughshod over all their cutting edge advancements in research. We see them studying the placement of the planets and stars, but nothing to imply that they're thinking of actually putting someone there, much less have already done it.

As for satellite imaging, are you kidding? In this day and age, most of us have the fruits of satellite imaging in our pockets, ready to be consulted when we get lost on our way to our mother in law's house. Satellite imaging allows for GPS, and it allows someone on the opposite end of the world to see what this one store in Lagos looks like. Apparation doesn't even begin to allow that, and as for transportation, it's said repeatedly that you need to know what a place looks like in order to Apparate there and it is risky to the point of stupid to try apparating too far in one leg.
