I disagree.

Think about why computers were invented: physics and calculations.

Magic does not follow physics. They don't need equations to see how physics work as they are above it.

Internet: easy communication (email). Again, wizards don't need fast communication when you can literally pop over to your co-worker, friend, etc and say hi to them in person.

Space Travel: We have no idea if wizards have been to the moon or not.

Satellite Imaging: Invented for military intelligence mostly. Once again useless with apparation.

A society with near instant teleportation would be unrecognizable to our world today. It's actually crazy how similar their society is to Muggles. In reality, it should be almost like stepping into a brand new world. Everything would be different. Society would have completely different ideals, goals and more.
