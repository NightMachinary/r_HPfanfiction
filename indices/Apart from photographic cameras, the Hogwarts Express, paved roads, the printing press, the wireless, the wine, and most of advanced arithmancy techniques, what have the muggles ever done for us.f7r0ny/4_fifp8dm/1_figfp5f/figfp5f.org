The key is that all those things wizards use have been static for thousands of years while muggles have been exponentially expanding their capabilities. This has left wizards complacent and almost entirely unaware of muggles' capacity to overtake them. By now (2020), muggles have things like space travel, the Internet, and satellite imaging, all things that wizards have no equivalent for and would have no awareness of. At the rate of muggle growth compared to wizards', there will come a time where muggles could easily dominate wizards and they wouldn't see it coming.
