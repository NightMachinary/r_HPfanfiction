Magic makes a lot of things easy but that also means that wizards don't have that much motivation to do better. When you can use spells to make plants grow faster there's no need to understand the biology of how plants work. When you can teleport from one end of the country to the other instantly there's no need to develop an understanding of supersonic aerodynamics. When you can enchant candles to last forever there's no need for electric light. But without those things they lack the knowledge they would need to do more advanced things. Gene editing? Space flight? Computers? Those things are much easier with magic than without but you still need to know what you're doing.
