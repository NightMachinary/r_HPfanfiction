  Generally until about, say, the 1950's the Non Magical world was probably a lower standard of living then the Magical world, and seeing as how long wizards live, that means those 'Uppity Muggles' seem to suddenly not realis how nice the life style they are getting is. Because most of the Wizards and Witches live till they are at least a hundred in realitive good shape, their views are not able to grasp just how quickly things have changed in their life time/
