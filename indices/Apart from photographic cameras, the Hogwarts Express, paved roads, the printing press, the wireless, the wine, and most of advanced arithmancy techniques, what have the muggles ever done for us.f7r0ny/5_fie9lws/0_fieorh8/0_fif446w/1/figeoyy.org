I don't even think a bubble head charm would stop the radiation. The particles that make radiation so dangerous are much, much smaller than water molecules. They can fly through the gaps between protons and electrons. They could fly through the air molecules creating the bubble around a wizard's head and fly straight through their skull, knocking out some very important electrons on the way and destroying some very important cells that will now continue replicating, their damage spreading and spreading into massive and full-body cancers.
