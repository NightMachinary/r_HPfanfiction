No.

It's magic. It doesn't matter how complicated the act of digestion is. Magic works on a conceptual level, not a physical. They can turn a desk into a living pig. Does McGonagall know every little detail of the biology of a pig? No, of course not. But it doesn't matter. It's still 100% an actual pig. Magic can make things self-animate or even sentient, transform or create molecules/atoms, things that are incredibly difficult or energy intensive or impossible by conventional physics. It works on abstract concepts like love, secrets, and promises, which are not even things as far as mundane science is concerned.

The context of the conversation about conjuring food was completely about "we are not cooks, and our food tastes bad", NOT "we are in danger of starving, we need nutrition". So it makes far, far more sense to me, that the exception is "can't magically create cooked/prepared meals".

Now, you do raise a point about things like fruits and vegetables that can be eaten raw. It would've helped all the students hiding in the Room of Requirement, instead of having to get supplies from Aberforth. One option is that such things do run afoul of the exceptions- ie. you can't conjure an apple, but you could transfigure an apple tree. Alternatively, conjuration and transfiguration is difficult (conjuration is 7th year NEWT level). So honestly just having a garden might be easier in the long run. For someone like Molly, she's probably a better gardener and cook than she is at transfiguration, so it'd yield better tasting results too.
