That's always been a preferred theory of mine about why you can't make real food but a lot of people seem to dislike the idea. Like anything transfigured is just an imitation of what it's being transfigured into. I figure the human body and animals as well, are exceedingly complex and impossible to visualize completely, especially all the things that make something real.
