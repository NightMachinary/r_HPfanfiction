I've recently taken a page from Dresden files in my theory about this. In one of the books an entity dumbed down an idea for a lesser entity who dumbed it down again for a human, things being lost in translation. Another is that the reason wizards use foci is because there's so much going on that it's difficult to keep your mind on everything at once. I'd imagine it's especially true for transfiguration. I'd imagine there are very few professional nutritionists who know exactly how nutrients work, what they're made of, etc by heart without needing to reference anything and, if they had magic, could then take all of that knowledge and successfully making an anatomically correct animal complete with nutrients. Just the nutrients would be bad enough id think. And why would a person try very hard to get past that limitation when there are so many easier, more effective options.
