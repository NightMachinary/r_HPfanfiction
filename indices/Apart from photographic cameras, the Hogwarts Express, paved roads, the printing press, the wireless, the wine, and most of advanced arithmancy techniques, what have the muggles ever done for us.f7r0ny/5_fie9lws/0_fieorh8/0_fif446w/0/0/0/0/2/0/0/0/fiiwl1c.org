Honestly the whole magical world is full of holes and contradictions. Can't make food from nothing but you can do other stuff. Can turn one thing into another like its nothing but making gold is somehow impossible unless you're Nicholas Flamel. I think in this regard some fan fiction has pretty good explanations for transfiguration. Turning an inanimate object into say a bird doesn't make it an actual bird but it just looks and acts like a bird because thats what it has been spelled to do.
