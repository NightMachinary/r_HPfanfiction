My guess is that it comes down to the nutrition. There's something intrinsically different about something that was conjured and something that wasn't, but whatever that 'thing' is, it doesn't affect the quality of things like chairs or teapots or what have you. But it does affect the quality of food.

It makes sense if you think about it. Food and how it's absorbed into the body is very complicated. Some proteins do this and some do that or some do this other thing but only when paired with this other naturally occurring compound. One altered bond between molecules and artificial sugar flows through the body without being absorbed at all. So maybe you can conjure food after all, but the body just can't absorb it like natural food, so you're basically starving and malnourished even when you're consuming nonstop food. This might expand to trying to cook bacon from a conjured pig, which would explain why the Weasleys have a garden instead of just conjuring vegetables.
