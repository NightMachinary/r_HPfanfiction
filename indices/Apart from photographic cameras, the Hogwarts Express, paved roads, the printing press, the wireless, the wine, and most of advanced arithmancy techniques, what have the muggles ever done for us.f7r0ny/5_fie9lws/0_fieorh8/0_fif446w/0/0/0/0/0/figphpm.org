If you look at the passage in question, it was never just 'food'- it was specifically "good food". The trio were had edible things, they were not in danger of starving, but it all tasted like crap, because none of them had any real skill (magical or mundane) at food prep and cooking. Ron's complaint was that he wanted his mum's cooking because it tasted great, not that he was hungry. And Hermione's response was "well, if my cooking's rubbish, /you do it then/".

So I'm of the belief that you can conjure/transfigure raw food stuff- ie. a thing that theoretically edible, but you cannot directly magically create a finished meal. ie. you can create a pig, but you cannot instantly create bacon.

This generally fits in with some other possible exemptions- finished products, of a sorts. Things like books and the like. You could conjure paper, and form it into a book. You could use magic to do the physical act of writing for you. You could use magic to duplicate the finished book. But the actual ah, creation, or art, the knowledge or story or whatever you're trying to impart, has to be done by you, not summoned from the aether. Or things like potions ingredients, or cooking ingredients, are prepared by, well not by hand necessarily, but the act of chopping is done to them for example. Like, you have to chop carrots, you can't transfigure a carrot directly into a chopped carrot, though the knife could be enchanted to do so automatically or you could use a cutting spell.

That said, we do see people transfigure or conjure other finished products- furniture, teapots, clothes I believe. An expertly carved chair is for sure a work of art, so 'having some element of craft or work' can't be the totality of the exception.
