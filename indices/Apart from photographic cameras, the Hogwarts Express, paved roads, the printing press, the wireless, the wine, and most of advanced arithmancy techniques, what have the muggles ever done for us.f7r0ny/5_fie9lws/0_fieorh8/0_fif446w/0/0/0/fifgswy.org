  Why would the magical community know anything about radiation or how to stop it?
#+end_quote

Ok, first, why would they need to know it? Kids don't know the anatomy of all the living creatures they create. Wizards don't understand the human mind but they still use memory charms.

Secondly, this "magical world is so ignorant" argument is lazy and kind of bigoted? You cannot generalize an entire population as ignorant. Muggle-borns and half-bloods exist. Not all purebloods would be ignorant. And Muggle libraries and computers are accessible.

  Also you should look into Gamps Law of Elemental Transfiguration when talking about creating matter.
#+end_quote

Who cares? They can create matter, that's all that's important. It's called the Principal /Exceptions/ to Gamp's Law for a reason, because things like food are /exceptions./ This isn't a valid counter argument.

  Aguamenti is also something else that's not explained well but stands to reason it's drawing water from somewhere else or combining existing oxygen and hydrogen molecules in the surrounding atmosphere into something else
#+end_quote

Well, we do have switching spells, but there's no reason to believe Aguamenti is one of them. Secondly, we see them conjure or trsnsfigure other matter too. There's zero evidence that all these trsnsfigured animals are just disappearing from somewhere.

The implications of your argument here, if true, would be /huuuge/ in the wizarding world. Why haven't we ever seen anything disappear if everything conjured or trsnsfigured is just being switched places from somewhere else?

Thirdly, magic does not care for science. It doesn't function by science logic. So why would it combine existing oxygen and hydrogen molecules?

Why would it even need to? The magic we see in canon is shown to be immensely more complex and incredible (Fidelius, fiendfyre, curse on the Dada position, the taboo, Horcruxes, time turners, acrruate models of the entire galaxy, etc).

I mean, just look at the human mind. We understand nukes. We created them. We do not understand the human mind. Yet wizards casually manipulate it. Wizards can literally manipulate time and fate itself.

But for some reason blocking nukes is too far? We can disagree on this of course! But there are so many things wizards can do that we can't, and we /can/ protect against nukes.

  As far as needing the energy of 250 nukes, where is that from?
#+end_quote

A bunch of scientific journals I read a few years ago. I'm at work but just look up "energy to create matter" I guess.
