I mean it makes sense. Would also work for not being able to make food out of nothing. All you would end up doing at most is making a magical representation of the food but it's not actually food, only looks like it. Much like how a patronus isn't an actual animal but a magical representation of one. Granted that's different but still you couldn't shoot Harry's stag patronus and make venison out of it.
