Why would the magical community know anything about radiation or how to stop it? Also you should look into Gamps Law of Elemental Transfiguration when talking about creating matter. It mentions food specifically that we know of but if you can't make food out of nothing then it stands to reason you can't make any sort of matter out of nothing. It looks like you can but it's all one thing transfigured into something else or conjured. Aguamenti is also something else that's not explained well but stands to reason it's drawing water from somewhere else or combining existing oxygen and hydrogen molecules in the surrounding atmosphere into something else. As far as needing the energy of 250 nukes, where is that from?
