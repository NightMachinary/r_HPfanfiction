Not necessarily. Conventional bombs deal damage mainly through shrapnel and blast of explosion, while nuclear bombs release a lot of their energy as heat and nuclear radiation. Protego and the like are transparent, so the flash and nuclear radiation are still a problem.

Shields are used to stop physical objects and (most of) magic from passing through. They don't block the light of sun, which is made by the same general process as light from atom bomb explosion, neither they stop the sound (Voldemort screaming at Harry to surrender on book 7). So flash and following shockwave are still threats.

I see what you mean, "magic can figure it out", except it apparently doesn't work that way since there is no shield (except physical object) that can to stop unforgivables, so it's more like "magic can fill in the gaps where you don't feel like doing it by hand, but you still need to figure out the process", ie you can transfigure pillows to cats but you can't (normally) transfigure lead to gold.
