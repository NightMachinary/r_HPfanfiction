  Protego and the like are transparent, so the flash and nuclear radiation are still a problem.

Why? If the shield charm is meant to protect, why wouldn't it protect against those things? Nullify the flash and stop the radiation. It's magic, and we see HP magic work on a conceptual level.

It would fit perfectly into canon if my interpretation was true. Extended canon supports it also, with Pottermore stating that magic generally overrides the mundane, and this is why wizards can cure any muggle disease.

(Edit: Not that my interpretation is the only interpretation!)

  They don't block the light of sun, which is made by the same general process as light from atom bomb explosion, neither they stop the sound (Voldemort screaming at Harry to surrender on book 7).

None of those things are direct threats though. Idk to me that's like saying a shield charm can't protect against hurricane winds because it doesn't protect against general air, or fire because general warmth can get through.

  except it apparently doesn't work that way since there is no shield (except physical object) that can to stop unforgivables
#+end_quote

Well, no shield can stop the Killing Curse. We don't have any evidence that says the other two can't be blocked.

A certain special magic being unable to be blocked by magic doesn't really lend credit to a stronger enchantment being unable to block against nukes.

  you can't (normally) transfigure lead to gold.

I don't think this is canon.
