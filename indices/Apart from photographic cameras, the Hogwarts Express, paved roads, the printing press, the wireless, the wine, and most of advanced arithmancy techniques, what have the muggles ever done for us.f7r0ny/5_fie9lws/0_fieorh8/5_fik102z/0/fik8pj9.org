If protective charms against bombs were already set in place, it's plausible that the same protections would protect against nukes. And given the bombings on London, such protections probably are in place.

I don't believe they have to know about any real details of nukes to block against them. A simple shield charm is meant to protect against general harm. There's not a different shield charm for every spell or every type of physical object.

We see wizards manipulate the human mind. We see kids transfigure living organisms. They probably don't understand the human mind or the anatomy of all the creatures they create, though.
