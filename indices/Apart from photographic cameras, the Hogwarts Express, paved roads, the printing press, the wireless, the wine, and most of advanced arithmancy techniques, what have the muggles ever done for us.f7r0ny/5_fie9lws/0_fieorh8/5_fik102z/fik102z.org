Can't defend against something if you don't know it exists. Americans kept Manhattan Project extremely secret, it would be obvious that Germany in alternative universe would do the same. And even if they knew it existed, there's another problem to consider:

During the Blitz, Germany used mostly He-111 which usually carried 8x SC-250 or 32x SC-50, or one SC-2000 and one SC-500. The biggest one, SC-2000, has around *900 kg of TNT* equivalent. Now, the Little Boy, weakest of the two, was 15kt TNT equivalent, not counting the flash and radiation, that's 16 times more than the biggest baddest bomb Germans dropped on London. So any ward that would straight up block the blast is out, because they were designed to withstand 900kg TNT, maybe double that, but not *15 times* more.

And... all that I said is useless because most likely wizards won't defend against bombs by blocking the blast and shrapnel, instead they would probably just redirect the bomb somewhere else, which won't work on Little Boy kind of bomb because it was air bursted at 1900-ish m, aka quite far from the ground.
