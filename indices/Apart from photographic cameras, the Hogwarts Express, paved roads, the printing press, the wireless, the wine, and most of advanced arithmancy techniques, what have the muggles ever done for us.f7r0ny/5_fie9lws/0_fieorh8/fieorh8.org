That's /highly/ debatable. First we would have to assume magical protections couldn't protect against nukes. Secondly, even if they couldn't, plenty of wizards live outside of London.

Really, the existence of nukes would be an argument against muggles. "They're literally wiping out entire cities, the barbarians!"

--------------

Edit: Since someone will probably argue nukes can get past magical protections, let me make my argument first:

First, it's magic. It bypasses all logic and science. Protecting against nukes would not be the craziest thing we see magic do.

Secondly, even if we want to look at magic from a "scientific" view, the energy of nukes is /nothing/ compared to the energy we see wizards use. Creating matter is no easy thing, and wizards do it with absurd ease.

Scientists have concluded that creating even one glass of water would need the energy of the equivalent of 250 nuclear bombs (the ones we dropped on Japan, I believe). If I wasn't on my phone, I'd gather sources for this. But look it up, creating matter is immensely difficult.

And yet wizards casually create huge amounts of water. So, energy wise, wizards make nukes look like TV remote batteries.

So either way you look at it, blocking nukes is completely reasonable.
