They are very good at creating energy (via matter), but they honestly don't seem that good at blocking it. If you look at the explosive spells that are being blocked with shielding spells, I honestly doubt they could block a nuke. And even if they can block the explosive force, I definitely can't imagine them blocking the radiation.
