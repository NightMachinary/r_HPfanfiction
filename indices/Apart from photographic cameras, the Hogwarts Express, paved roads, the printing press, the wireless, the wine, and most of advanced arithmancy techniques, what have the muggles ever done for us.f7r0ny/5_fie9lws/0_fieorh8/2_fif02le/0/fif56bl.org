Well, those are explosive /spells/. It's other magic. Nukes are not magic. And do we actually see shields fail against explosive spells ever in canon? Edit: No we don't. There's no mention of an explosion failing to be blocked by magic.

  And even if they can block the explosive force, I definitely can't imagine them blocking the radiation.

Why? If a protective enchantment is meant to protect, then it would protect against radiation too. Idk why people are so unwilling to believe that *magic* could do something that's not even that extraordinary.

The magic we see in canon is shown to be immensely more complex and incredible (Fidelius, fiendfyre, curse on the Dada position, the taboo, Horcruxes, time turners, acrruate models of the entire galaxy, etc).

I mean, just look at the human mind. We understand nukes. We created them. We do not understand the human mind. Yet wizards casually manipulate it. Wizards can literally manipulate time and fate itself.

I don't believe that nukes are somehow too much. Wizards do many other things that are well beyond nukes when it comes to the realm of possibilities.
