Even ignoring that this gets pretty darn close to violating the rule that wizards can't conjure food (my thought is that even if they transfigure something inedible into something edible, that thing won't have any nutritional value if they try to eat it), stones are irradiated too. Everything touched by a nuclear bomb's radiation is irradiated and will probably remain irradiated for decades.
