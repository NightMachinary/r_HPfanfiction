The issue with a nuke isn't the initial blast. The initial blast is bad enough. The issue with a nuke is the radiation. There is a reason why nuclear war would be the end of the world, and it's not because people think that every country in the world would be hit directly.

Think of Chernobyl. Think of how over thirty years after the disaster, it's still considered uninhabitable. Now think of a bomb designed to create that effect across a country.

The radiation would first hit everything--organic and inorganic--well beyond the blast radius. Billions upon billions of particles hitting you so hard and fast that it literally knocks electrons out of your molecules, destroying your DNA irreparably. Your DNA will struggle to keep doing its job to replicate and keep you going, and if you're lucky, it'll fail quickly and you won't have to go through the excruciating process of dying slowly and painfully. The radiation will linger in the cement, in the buildings, in the trees, so that anyone who handles them will also start getting sick. The radiation will poison the ground, and for decades afterwards every crop it produces will be full of poison, irradiating the jaws and stomachs and colons of every human and animal that consumes it, no matter how far it travels from the blast. Animals will die from radiation, and those that don't will die from starvation.

And even worse, the cherry on top, is that nuclear winter will begin. The soot caused by the blast will be ejected into the atmosphere, covering the sky in a black blanket and chilling the temperatures. The sky will hold the radiation, bringing it back down to the ground across the entirety of Europe in the form of rain and snow that poisons the ground and people there as well. Britain will have a winter that lasts for years, choking off even their poisoned crops, and after the winter is finally over and perhaps some people managed to survive, nuclear summer will begin.

The radiation and soot has destroyed the ozone layer. There is little to nothing protecting the world from UV rays. It becomes dangerous to go outside during the daytime because the sun burns so fast and hot and skin cancer is now on the rise. Temperatures increase, the glaciers melt, and the oceans rise. Most land is cracked from the heat or underwater, and there is little airable land left.

So no. It doesn't matter if Hogwarts gets over its sense of superiority and can wiggle its fingers and survive the initial blast. If the blast doesn't get wizards, and even if they magically cure all cancers, the starvation will still get them, along with a large chunk of the muggle population (though muggles have stronger protections against the effects of nuclear winter due to their food infrastructure (plus greater knowledge of nuclear holocaust) and thus would probably outlast wizards, there would still be mass death). If muggles really saw the need to nuke wizards, it would be all over.
