Many of the witches and wizards seem to think that muggles can't touch them in the first place. Muggleborns (especially once born after WW2) and half-bloods that keep in touch with the muggle world know what destruction muggles can bring about, but everyone else has no idea, and isn't likely to believe these muggle-raised people after sitting through the outdated muggle studies class. Sooo... How can they put up protections against something that they don't even know exists? The explosion, there may be a chance, but how can they block out radiation if they don't know the first thing about it? And the muggleborns and half-bloods only have the knowledge of a middle-schooler, so unless they went to do a bunch of research in their free time, they honestly don't know much more than the wizarding raised people either.
