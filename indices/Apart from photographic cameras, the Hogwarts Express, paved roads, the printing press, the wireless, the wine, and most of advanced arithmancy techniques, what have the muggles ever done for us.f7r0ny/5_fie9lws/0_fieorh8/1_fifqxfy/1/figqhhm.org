I think this is wizard-kind's biggest vulnerability: their ignorance and sense of superiority over muggles. They don't consider that muggles could ever pose a real threat to them, to the point where a guy in charge of dealing with muggle objects (Arthur Weasley) knows next to nothing about their technology despite making it his hobby as well as his profession.

Assuming that wizards could actually see the nuke coming and were able to set up sufficient protections against the blast, I don't think that they would have the humility to think that they should research further into the bombs themselves nor listen to any intrepid muggleborn that would try to warn them about radiation.

By the time they'd be seeing the effects of radiation on people's health, the land, and the weather, and by the time they'd realize it was connected to the bomb, I think it'd be too late.
