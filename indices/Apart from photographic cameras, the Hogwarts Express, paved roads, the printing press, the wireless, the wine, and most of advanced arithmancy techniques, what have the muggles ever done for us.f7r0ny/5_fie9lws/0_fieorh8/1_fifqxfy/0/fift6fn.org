  Many of the witches and wizards seem to think that muggles can't touch them in the first place.
#+end_quote

Considering this, and the fact no one argues against it in canon, isn't it possible to you that they believe this for good reason.

#+begin_quote
  Muggleborns (especially once born after WW2) and half-bloods that keep in touch with the muggle world know what destruction muggles can bring about, but everyone else has no idea
#+end_quote

Why wouldn't everyone else know? Entire cities have been bombed to hell by muggles. Even purebloods would know about entire cities being destroyed.

#+begin_quote
  isn't likely to believe these muggle-raised people after sitting through the outdated muggle studies class
#+end_quote

Pure fanon. There's nothing to suggest the muggle studies class is outdated in canon.

#+begin_quote
  How can they put up protections against something that they don't even know exists?
#+end_quote

They don't even need to know about it. They just need protective enchantments that protect against harm.

They create living organisms despite not knowing anatomy. They manipulate the human mind despite not understanding all of its complexity.

Wizards clearly do not need to know about these things in detail to use magic on them.
