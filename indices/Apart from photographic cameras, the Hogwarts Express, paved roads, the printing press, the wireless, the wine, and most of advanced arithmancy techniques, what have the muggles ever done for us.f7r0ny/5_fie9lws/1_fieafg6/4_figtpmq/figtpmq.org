The magical leaders don't really have to report, they do it out of politeness. Like, if a Minister of Magic /didn't/ show up to introduce himself to a muggle PM, the PM wouldn't even notice, since he wouldn't even know they existed.

And oh, they embedded Kingsley into the PM's security detail, with no one the wiser. They casually rescheduled a call between the PM and another foreign leader (I think America?) because it was more convenient for the magicals.

Magicals have infiltrated the highest levels of muggle government, can casually rewrite minds and hide themselves/information/physical locations, and no muggles even know they exist unless the magicals specifically introduce themselves.

They won.
