Not even remotely true. The wizards went into hiding for convenience, not due to a threat of extinction.

Chapter 1 of PoA makes it quite clear that muggles weren't a significant threat. It even implies you could argue that the witch hunts were completely pointless.

Furthermore, the worst tragedy of the witch hunts for the wizards were the Salem Trials. In which about 19 or so people died. And only /some/ were wizards. So the worst tragedy was /maybe/ 10 or so wizards being killed.

You don't think we built homes and boarded them up against outside creatures because we were in danger of being wiped out by squirrels, do you?
