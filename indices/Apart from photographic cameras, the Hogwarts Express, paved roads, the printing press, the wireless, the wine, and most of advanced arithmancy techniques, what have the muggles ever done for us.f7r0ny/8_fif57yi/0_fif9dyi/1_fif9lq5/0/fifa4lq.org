Flying is something WAY easier when you can break the laws of physics. A printing press is a quite simple mechanical thing, probably a little easier to build with magic but not that much more than without. Given that there's way more creative muggles than creative wizards (population sizes) it's likely muggles came up with it first. And it's a way bigger game-changer when you don't have magic.
