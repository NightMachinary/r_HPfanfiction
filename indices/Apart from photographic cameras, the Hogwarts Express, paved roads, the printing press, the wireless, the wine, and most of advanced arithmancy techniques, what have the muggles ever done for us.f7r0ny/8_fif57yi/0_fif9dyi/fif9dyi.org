I like reading printed/typed text more than handwriting. And an enchanted press is probably easier to run than to cast thousands of duplication charms a day for a newspaper. Plus a press produces consistent quality while duplicated books might have mistakes if the duplicator got sloppy with the wand movement. I don't want to cast hundreds of duplication charms a day only to then have to proof-read every book I made for errors. With a printing press it's enough to proof-read one copy and you can be pretty sure the others are the same.
