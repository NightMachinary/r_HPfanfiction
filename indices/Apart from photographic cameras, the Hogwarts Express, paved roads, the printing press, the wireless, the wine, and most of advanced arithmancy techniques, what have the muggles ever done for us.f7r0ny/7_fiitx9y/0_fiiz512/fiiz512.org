Doesn't Xeno Lovegood have some kind of magical printing press in DH? Either way they could just write out one paper and duplicate the whole thing with magic, no need for them to use automatic quills for each individual paper.

Arithmancy is a study of magic, and we're never shown if any Muggle mathematics even come into play. Hell, we don't even know if, in the Potterverse, mathematics are a purely Muggle concept or if wizards had a hand in creating them before the two societies separated.

I think Colin mentions that the film has to be developed into a certain potion before the pictures will move, although perhaps that's just for Muggle film and actual wizard film is different.

For food, Herbology is an entire core subject at Hogwarts, and, as you said, we see Hagrid having a garden, and the Weasleys are said to have a garden but the description is vague enough to either be an actual garden (but not well kept) or a "garden" of wild-growing vegetation. We do only see them shop for school supplies and not groceries. Is there even a grocer in Diagon Alley?

Now sure, Herbology is about magical plants, but if they're learning how to grow and harvest those then normal plants would be no problem. It's the same basic skill set, but the magical and dangerous plants require more care and caution. So I don't see any reason why most families wouldn't have their own gardens and grow most of their own food. Especially with magic being able to make it grow faster, duplicate it, and probably protect it from pests and keep it ripe. Families like the Weasleys would probably tend to their garden themselves, while families like the Malfoys would have their House Elf(ves) take care of it.
