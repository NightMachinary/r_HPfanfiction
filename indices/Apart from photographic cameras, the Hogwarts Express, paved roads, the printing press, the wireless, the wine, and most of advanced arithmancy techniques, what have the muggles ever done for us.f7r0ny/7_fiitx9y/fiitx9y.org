I hate this assumption.

First off, our introduction to the wizarding world is through the eyes of a child in one specific area of the Wizarding World: Hogwarts. We know almost nothing about the magical society and how it functions.

Secondly, in a world with instant teleportation, society would be vastly different than what we have today.

Why would wizards need paved roads? They teleport.

Printing Press: We know there are copying quills in HP (during OOTP and cheating methods). You have a couple hundred of these and your papers are copied in a few hours with no effort.

Arithmancy: Why do wizards need advanced techniques. Magic does not follow physics.

Photography: We have no idea who invented it first. Moreso, Photography in the wizarding world is more like a short video.

Wine: uh... Wine has been around for over 8,000 years. Not the best example. Especially as you have elf-wine in canon.

Food: They could probably grow food in a fraction of the time (look how big Hagrid's pumpkins got in a few weeks). We literally have no idea as it's never mentioned.

All in all, it is amazing that wizard culture is as similar to muggle culture as it is. If George RR Martin had done the world building, wizard culture would be more akin to entering an alien world than ours. Whole values of society would be different; our fears, goals and everything that matters in society...
