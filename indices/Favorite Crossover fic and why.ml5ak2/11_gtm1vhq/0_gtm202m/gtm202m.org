  Nicholas Flamel was famous for creating the philosopher's stone, but like Lockhart's smile it was all a lie. Flamel stole a part of the stone and it took Edward 642 years to get it back along with the souls inside of it, one which was his brother. But after traveling to Hogwarts to retrieve it, Dumbledore has other plans for the ancient hero. HP book 2/Brotherhood. Please Review.

  Of all things Edward was prepared for as the day of reckoning grew near, being transported from one world on the edge of war to another was not one of them. AKA: Edward gets accidentally summoned by Death Eaters, and neither party is happy. (Pre-Promise Day, HP book 5)

  When Roy Mustang went to retrieve his eyesight from Truth, he wasn't expecting to end up doing a job in exchange. It couldn't even be an easy job, of course, because Edward's assessment of Truth was a pretty accurate one.
