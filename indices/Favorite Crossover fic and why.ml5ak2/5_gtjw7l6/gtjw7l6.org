Here we go. Not counting Shezzas denarian series because everybody knows about it here are a couple of must reads:

linkffn(Kicking Gotham) and its sequel Linkffn(Toppling Heroes)

Following the DC theme here are two more.

linkffn(Death's knight) and linkffn(Death's knight: Revisited) both exeptional fanfics

For SW I see that the havoc side of the force has already been recomended. It is by far the best SW crossover (in my opinion).

Marvel: Here there are plenty of fics most of them mediocre and just poor refrasings of one of the avenger movies. However linkffn(Wand and Shield) really does stand out.

Nuhu has written several good crossovers and I would recomend checking them out. linkffn(Retsu's Folly) is just about the only good bleach crossover that I have found.

Not everybody has the same taste as I but if somebody wants more recomendations just comment.
