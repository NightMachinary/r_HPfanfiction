Star wars definitively has a bunch of really food crossovers with hp .but the buffy verse surprises me. I can only think of like 2 or 3 that I've read and while they were all amazing I just don't remember many that exist. Then again I haven't read one of the ones you recommended so I'm going to do that now!!
