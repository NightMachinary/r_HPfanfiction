I'm a big fan of crossovers by mjimeyg and Vimesenthusiast on ffnet. For example, linkffn(Potter's Protector by mjimeyg), linkffn(Ah, Screw It! by mjimeyg), linkffn(What's a Gungan? by mjimeyg), linkffn(A Third Path to the Future by Vimesenthusiast), linkffn(Magic of the Force by Vimesenthusiast).

I'd also recommend linkffn(It's All Relative on the Hellmouth), and can't help but plug my own crossover linkao3(15308061). My crossover was specifically written to avoid having OP ninjas just solve all the problems.

As for question #2, Star Wars and the Buffyverse seem to have the best crossovers. There's a good amount of crossover potential in the Dresden Files, though the fics I've found so far there have been darker than my preference, and in Naruto if the issue of the wildly different power curves is addressed effectively (usually by transporting Harry to Konoha rather than bringing ninjas to Hogwarts).
