It has a OP aristocratic!fem!Harry gathering up a posse, the antagonists are Ministry (incopetence&corruption) and Dumbledore (went senile in his old age)... Voldemort isn't a big deal, and after the HP story is done that cast act as Outside Context Problems for the Mafia where they then tread through that canon story with alterations... where the Leader also has gone senile in his old age.

The main reason I love it is the Author's writing style, where the characters think out their reasoning in a matter of fact manner while lamenting the stupidity of the situation.

  The immensely tall woman in front of the carriage was doubtless Madame Maxime, though Dorea really had to wonder about the thirteen-odd older teens shivering behind her. Hadn't they heard how abysmal the Scottish weather was? It wasn't exactly a secret! She was not surprised when their statuesque headmistress led them inside to warm up, though Dorea didn't think much of their intelligence if they hadn't thought of Warming Charms.
