One of my favorites is probably; linkffn(Harry Potter, Squatter by Enterprise1701-d) Because honestly it's just really nice and fluffy. Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20 by Sir Poley) I haven't read it in a while but I just remember it being amazing, the mesh of adding a character that has to use their universe rules in hp universe is just a really cool concept.

Question #2: honestly probably star trek crossovers have the best quality in my opinion, even if haven't read one in ages.
