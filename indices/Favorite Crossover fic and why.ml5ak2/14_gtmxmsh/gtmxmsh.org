There's a writer on AO3, MagdaTheMagpie, who's churned out 50 or 60 some MCU/Harry Potter crossover one-shots.

And I absolutely love #32, "Food for Thought". It's low-key, short, and lovely. Takes place entirely at meetings of the veterans' support group The Falcon's running in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, when a Pansy Parkinson who's not in a good place after fleeing Britain post-war to escape reprisals starts showing up for the free snacks.
