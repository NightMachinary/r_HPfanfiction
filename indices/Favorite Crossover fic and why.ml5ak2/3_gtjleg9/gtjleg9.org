Mine is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9905105/1/][To Ride Upon Svadilfari]] by [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/1693442/][Evil Is A Relative Term]], a crossover with the Avengers. It has some of the best world-building and characterization I have ever seen. The characters are all really nuanced and the relationships are so complicated and wonderful to read. Sadly, it is abandoned, but it was so good while it lasted.
