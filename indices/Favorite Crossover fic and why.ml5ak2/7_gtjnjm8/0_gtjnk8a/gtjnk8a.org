  Steffon Baratheon has changed Westeros with his presence, but the Game has just gotten more dangerous. King Robert travels north to get a Hand and a bride for his son; Steff and Joff contend with the new players in the game all while trying to figure out who might have had Jon Arryn killed. In the North, cold winds stir as ancient foes awaken. To the East, dragons are born in fire as a conquest is planned, and in the South, a king is crowned amidst chaos.
