*The Storm Prince* by witlessmaester is my favourite HP/GoT crossover. The writing and story is good, Harry loves his siblings and it heads off into new directions. There is also a part 2 but it isn't complete and has been on Hiatus since January 2020. The author mentioned they kinda drove the story into a wall and need to rewrite it. I hope it isn't abandoned.
