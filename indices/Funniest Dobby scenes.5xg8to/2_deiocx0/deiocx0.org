A great one from the Parody Peggy Sue fic /Oh God, Not Again!/

Harry's marginally friendly with Draco in this fic and he asks him to ask Dobby to not "try to save his life" or "get him sent home."

Draco, bewildered, does so, but there's still the Rogue Bludger incident.

/"I thought Draco asked you not to save my life or get me sent home!"/

/"Debby wasn't trying to save Harry Potter's life, sir. Debby was trying to break Harry Potter's arm."/
