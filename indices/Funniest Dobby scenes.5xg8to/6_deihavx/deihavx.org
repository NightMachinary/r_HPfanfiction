I'm not a fan of Dobby (My first thought about his death was "Thank God."), so I tend to skip over any mention of him in a fic.

That said, my favourite Dobby scene is actually from /The Warp Zone/'s "If Harry Potter had Facebook". It's a video, not a fic, but it's the only time I've ever been entertained by Dobby.
