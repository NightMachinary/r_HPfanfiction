OK, this fic (Phoenix by Keira Marcos) was taken down until she completes it, but I will post the actual scene(s):

#+begin_quote
  Dobby appeared with a blanket and tucked it around Harry with a frown.

  “I leave my Harry Potter alone with Dumbles for just a few days and look what happens,” Dobby said with a sigh and a severe shake of his head. The elf inclined his head. “Dumbles be removing ward on Muggle house?”

  Dumbledore looked at the elf over his glasses. “As a matter of a fact I did.”

  “Good. Dobby not being able to get proper revenge with protections in place,” the elf cracked his knuckles and popped away without another word.

  Sirius looked at Dumbledore then at Amelia Bones who had followed them into the office. “Is that something we should worry about?”

  “Whatever he does to them, they deserve,” Dumbledore said.

and, later in the same fic:

  Albus sighed. “Harry, my boy, call your elf.”

  “Dobby.” The elf appeared immediately. He was dressed in a pair of combat boots and a miniature set of military fatigues.

  “What...” Minerva huffed and turned to Harry.

  “Don't look at me like that,” Harry protested. “He's on a /mission/ and needed a proper uniform for it.”

  “You should see his ninja outfit,” Zale confided. “It's great.”

  “Dobby be very stealthy ninja,” the elf declared.
