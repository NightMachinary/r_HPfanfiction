Going by JK's usual conventions, I'm inclined to say "Flooed" (stressing the capitalisation here, too).

On a related note, I get annoyed when people add unnecessary apostrophes like that. It's /Imperiused/, not /Imperio'd/. The other Unforgivables aren't given equivalents in the books, but /Crucio'd/ and /AK'd/ are just... no. To quote Michael Jordan, "Stop it. Get some help."
