The only problem with this topic is that it is incredibly spoiler heavy.

For me, its the end of The Firebird Trilogy, specifically the fate of one of the main characters. It's like a dagger to the chest =, (

Similarly, the St. Mungo scenes from both Restoring Hope and The Dementors Stigma.

Humor wise, chapter 17 or 18 of A Black Comedy.has incredibly amusing name pun scene.
