While I'm definitely not convinced of the rest of the fanfic's quality (or even if it's actually Harry Potter. The more I read, the more it seems like original fiction wallpapered over, there's so little it actually has in common with Harry Potter beyond character names), Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality's Battle Magic army fights. They're very imaginative and very funny, something that, regardless of any shortcomings, can be applied to the rest of the story.
