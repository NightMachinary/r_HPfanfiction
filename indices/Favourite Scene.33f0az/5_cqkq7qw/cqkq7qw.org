[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10339852/6/The-Many-Harry-Potters-of-Little-Hangleton][This one-shot]] the rest of the collection are humorus but it really is this one i find to be the best because it makes sorta fun of the entire WBWL concept. (I like that concept) and the way the one-shot is setup with only dialog really gives the one-shot charistma.
