Presumably Vernon maintains a job at Grunnings as some kind of middle manager. I'm not saying that he'd be brilliant at politics but I think he'd be competent enough, and certainly bitter enough, to intentionally vote in ways to ruin Harry's life for no reason other than that he /can/. The Potters historically always voted for one party? Well, Vernons now a straight line party voter for the opposition.

He doesn't know, or even /care/, why cauldron bottom thicknesses matter but if James and Lily Potter would have wanted them to be thin then by god he's voting for an increase. He signs his name with a flourish and every time he thinks about how those freaks upset Petunia on their wedding day.

Lucius Malfoy would ordinarily kill a muggle, for no reason other than /being/ a muggle. But this muggle is so far voting in his favor...? He and Vernon are content to never speak or even acknowledge one another.
