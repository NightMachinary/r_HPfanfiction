Love this! And thanks to you I am now imagining Vernon Dursley becoming one of the most well-read people in Wizarding Law and Government? Why? Because Vernon Dursley's got to make sure he screws with Harry every way he can - so he reads up on things like cauldron bottom thickness, international sport events or maybe that rule change in Quidditch (and Quidditch in the first place) just in order to make Harry's life just a bit harder.
