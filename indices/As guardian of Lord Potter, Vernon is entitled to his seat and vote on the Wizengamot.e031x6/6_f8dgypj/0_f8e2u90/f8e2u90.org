Oh, shit! Accepted by the wizards after all, Petunia goes on to become a pure-blood wannabe, glossing over her less-than-pure background and sucking up to any pure-blood that would give her the time of day. Like, Vernon had never had any desire to be anything more than his idea of a proper British man, but Petunia had always had a vaguer longing for "something more," and would be just as happy accepted into the wizarding world as the upper classes of muggle society. She'd jump into it, but the pure-blood bigots would eat her alive. Maybe Harry would have to save her from a Death Eater assassination plot.
