Vernon walked into the Wizengamot chamber with one thing in mind: to clean up these namby-pamby wizard types.

"I vote to reinstate capital punishment!" he declared, the first moment he was able to speak.

Albus Dumbledore looked down from the Chief Warlock's seat. "Mr Dursley, regrettably the wizarding world has never abolished such punishment. There is nothing to reinstate."

Vernon sat down, the wind temporarily taken from his sails. No matter... a stopped clock was right twice a day. It was inevitable that wizards would get /something/ right.

His next opportunity to speak came five minutes later. "I vote to eradicate income tax!"

Albus Dumbledore sighed. "Mr Dursley, wizards do not pay tax."

Vernon gaped. /No tax?/ He sat down again, his world tumbling down around him. How could /wizards/ get things so right?

It took some time to recover from his shock, but when he did, he took the chance to speak once more:

"I vote to leave the European Union!"

Albus Dumbledore pinched the bridge of his nose. "Mr Dursley, wizarding Britain is not part of the European Union."

Vernon turned to Petunia.

"That's it," he said, his voice firm. "Pet, pack up the house. We're moving to Diagon Alley."
