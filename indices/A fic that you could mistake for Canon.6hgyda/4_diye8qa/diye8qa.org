linkffn(Secret Keeper by ermalope) If Dumbledore made Snape the secret keeper to Lily's and James home. Everyone is in character and the fic is canon consistent other than that one change.

linkffn(Percy take the wheel) Molly Weasly is killed in an accident that puts her husband in a coma and its up to Percy to take charge of his family so that they are not split up. This fic is a WIP, but interesting so far.

linkffn(The changeling) Ginny is sorted into slytherin. The style of writing is quite different from JKR but the fic is canon consistent of what could happen if Ginny was sorted into a different house. Does have some mild Harry/Ginny pairing moments I believe later on, but it's a very small part of fic.
