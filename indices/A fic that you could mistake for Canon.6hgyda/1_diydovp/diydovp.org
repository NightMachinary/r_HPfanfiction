I'm really recommending this a lot lately, but "Hogwarts Houses Divided," which takes place eleven years after the Battle of Hogwarts, is so damn near the tone and feel of canon that I could have been fooled; the only real divergence is that a certain Theodore Lupin is Sorted into Gryffindor (because this fic was written before we got the info that he was a Hufflepuff in canon).

The new students, and a few of the teachers, are mostly OCs, but pretty much all the canon characters appear, in bigger or smaller roles, and they're all pretty much perfectly characterised. This is the sort of fic I could see happening during the nineteen-year gap, easily.

It's also a /really good story/. I still think it's one of the best HP fanfics I've ever read.

Almost as close, but not quite, is the "Weasley Girl" series. It's an AU where the change is that Ron Weasley was born a girl and given the name Veronica. It starts out with the scene where Harry's about to meet the Weasleys for the first time at King's Cross, and sort of goes from there.

The tone and feel is very close to canon, and the characters feel like the canon ones... (There's apparently been a few complaints that Snape is a little too nasty, but I think he seems perfectly IC.) The Fem!Ron is a little different, obviously; there's a lot of canon Ron in her but she's definitely her own person.

The plot, though... pretty much goes off the rails straight away. A lot of canon events still happen, but because the Weasley dynamic is different, Harry's experiences are different, and different reactions lead to different plot developments. Around the first Halloween things go off in their own direction... but in a way that you (or at least I) think "Yeah, I can see how that could have happened in the canon world."

It's not AS good as "Hogwarts Houses Divided," but it's still pretty good.
