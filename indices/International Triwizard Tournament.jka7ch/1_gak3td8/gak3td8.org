I don't think there's a Japanese competitor but the fourth book of Pureblood Pretense has a 9-competitor tournament with people from Africa and America. One of the better constructed Triwizards I've seen.

It's not international, but I'm also a really big fan of the Junior Wizarding Decathlon in the Alexandra Quick series.

The only issue with both of these is that you have to read through three or four previous instalments in the series to get to the tournaments and understand what's going on. They're both very long, but they're also both very good.
