Yes, 'pureblood culture' is a total fanon invention, created by people who thought Purebloods were some sort of sophisticated aristocracy.

On the other hand, Purebloods were not villains in the Books either. There was no glorious class struggle between tyrannical Purebloods and oppressed Muggleborns. Most in the DA and Order were Purebloods, and the war was mainly fought against Purebloods of the opposite ideology. Known Muggleborn participants beside Hermione, Dean, and Justin (even he went missing in the entire Book 7) were non existent.

Muggleborns made it to Minister (Nobby Leach in the 60s) and at least one department head (Dirk Cresswell) at the time of Voldemort takeover. It's interesting to note that Cresswell's heritage was only exposed through treachery, meaning that Ministry jobs didn't require applicants to specify their blood status.

In that particular fic you mentioned, it's on my favorite list and I still like it. However, the part about Sirius suddenly warming up to 'pureblood traditions' just feels incredibly OOC. Sirius was well know to piss on what his parents stood for, and he should even more so after suffering 12 years wrong imprisonment.
