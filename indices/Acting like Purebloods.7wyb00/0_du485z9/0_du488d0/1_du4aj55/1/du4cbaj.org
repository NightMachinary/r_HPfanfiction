It might be, but either way it's not something that I can see any of the main characters adhering too. It's worse in the fic as well as it literally come out of nowhere in the last few chapters, it's like the author wanted a certain amount of chapters but ended up finishing the story too early so they had to make up something else to fill in the remaining chapters, it was basically the equivalent of a tv show having all their filler episodes after the series finale instead of spread throughout the season.
