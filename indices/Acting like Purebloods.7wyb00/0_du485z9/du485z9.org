  why are so many authors obsessed with this apparent stuffy and backwards culture that in cannon very few people actually care about

I was under the impression this was 100% a fanon invention? I don't recall any times in canon where any characters acted this way, are there some? Certainly Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle never acted like they were going by 16th century aristocratic etiquette rules. Neither did Lucious or Belatrix or Snape. Not many other pureblood slytherins even had much dialogue that I can remember, Pansy and Milicent had a few lines I think, but again no weird etiquette rules.

And then beyond that I don't recall pureblood culture in general even being a thing. There were some superficial differences between Wizard and Muggle culture, but there didn't seem to be anything Pureblood specific, or similar to Pureblood culture in fanon unless I am forgetting something. They had different pop culture, but it was more alternate versions, e.g. beedle the bard instead of grimm, weird sisters instead of muggle rock bands, quiditch instead of soccer, etc, not really completely different in nature, just different instances. They also didn't use muggle technology, which is part of culture, but that's not really what most people mean when they talk about pureblood culture in fan fiction and is again just them having alternates for the same stuff, quills for pens, floo/night bus/apparition/port keys for cars and planes, owls for post office workers, etc. And yeah there fashion was different too, but its not like that would take more than a short period for a muggle born to familiarize themselves with, and no one ever commented that Harry or Hermione were wearing incorrect or odd clothes.

You can infer they had different views on political systems, freedom of the press, corruption, needed safety measures, treatment of prisoners, etc, which are big cultural differences. But again that's usually not what stereotypical Pureblood culture entails.
