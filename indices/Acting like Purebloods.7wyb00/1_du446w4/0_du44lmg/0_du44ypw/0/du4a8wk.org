The Ministry of Magic we experience in the books isn't /that/ different from governments throughout history, either when faced with what we'll call generational evil (Bin Laden), or when taken over by generational evil (Hitler).

Incompetent leaders with a biased media defending their actions and undermining their detractors? Yup

Throw away criminals to soul-sucking demons? We don't have soul sucking demons, but Gitmo and black sites like Abu Ghraib? Japanese internment? Yup yup

We don't have a direct version of putting dementors at Hogwarts, but an estimated 210,000 civilians were killed during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, so, y'know, not a huge premium was placed on making sure only enemy combatants suffered while we tried to fight Al Queda

I dispute that families were okay with squibs being killed. We're told that families often sent squibs away to live among muggles, which is debatably cruel or in their best interests, but is definitely not murdering them.

Once Voldemort came out into the open after OotP, he was opposed until he killed the Minister of Magic and installed a puppet.

I'd advise you to look into how schools were allowed to treat kids up to like the 80s. Corporal punishment was the rule, not the exception. It's still legal in like half of US states (Jesus Christ, America, get your shit together).

Dumbledore organized his resistance from Hogwarts, but he didn't face off against him at Hogwarts. Not sure what you're basing this on.

Bullying isn't exclusively a magical problem. Nobody at Hogwarts committed suicide from being bullied, which puts Hogwarts ahead of today's schools.

With the exception of Lockhart and Umbridge, none of the teachers are incompetent. Muggle studies only exists canonically when its teacher is murdered for teaching it too well. Harry doesn't pay attention in History of Magic, and doesn't try in Divination. Yes, Snape is a bully, no denying that. He doesn't try to murder or torture anyone, though.

Other than recognizing that, due to Voldemort inadvertently making Harry a horcrux, he'd have to die, he isn't willing to sacrifice any students, and he believes that if Harry willingly offers himself up, he won't actually die, so that's questionable.

Yeah, love potion is a weird grey area JK left, where it's sold by the twins at their joke shop, but in the same book, it's how Voldemort's mother conceived him.

That's an... aggressive description of legilimancy.
