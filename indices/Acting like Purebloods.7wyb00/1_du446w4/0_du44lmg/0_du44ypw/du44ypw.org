Many readers don't (or don't want to) see past the fantastic facade of magic and don't realize what a horrible dystopia Magical Britain actually was:

- Where the likes of Cornelius Fudge, Dolores Umbridge, Rita Skeeter, and Lucius Malfoy controlled the government and the media.
- Where the government would throw anyone it wanted to be tortured by soul-sucking demons.
- Where the government would place these soul-sucking demons around the only school of the country, just to catch one prison escapee who had never been convicted in a court of law.
- Where members of even 'enlightened' families such as the Longbottoms felt it was ok to murder their own children born with disabilities (Squib).
- Where a murdering psychopath was running almost unopposed by the government, calling out for genocide and mass torture.
- Where government officials could torture school children without repercussions.
- Where the supposedly wise and powerful headmaster would use his own school as a battleground to face off the above murdering psychopath, amid hundreds of children.
- Where school bullies ran unopposed and some openly called out for murders of a certain minority.
- Where half of the teaching staff (DADA, Potion, History, Divination, Muggle Studies) was incompetent, bullies, or actively trying to murder/torture students.
- Where the supposedly wise and powerful headmaster would resort to sacrifice children in his desperation to stop the above murdering psychopath.
- Where the use of date rape drug went unpunished or even seen as fun.
- Where they raped other people's mind whenever they felt like it.
