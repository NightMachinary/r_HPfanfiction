I would think that if the wizards were capable of creating an obliviate spell, aurora would at least have created something to return those memories... otherwise you can commit a crime, get rid of the witnesses, obliviate yourself and not even truth serum could say you're guilty... there's probably somekind of artifact that can restore memories... i think i remember a fanfic were neville's remember ball had this function were if a dark red light shines when you're touching it, it means you been obliviated and when that happens you just put your wand on the remember ball and it restores your memories... and that's pretty op, canon remember ball was useless... i can almost imagine Dark Harry pulling a Kira (where he touches the notebook and suddenly remembers that he is Kira)
