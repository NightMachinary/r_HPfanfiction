My headcanon is that there are two modes of Oblivation:

- Time-based: i.e., "Erase the last X minutes of memory." This is easy and isn't prevented by Occlumency, but is easily detected. Also, the amount of time it can cover with any amount of accuracy is very limited. It's what a typical wizard would use on a typical Muggle who saw too much.
- Legilimency-based: This version requires Legilimency to target the memories to be erased. It can erase any memory the Legilimens is aware of, and it can be undetectable if done particularly well, but a sufficiently skilled Occlumens cannot be Obliviated this way.
