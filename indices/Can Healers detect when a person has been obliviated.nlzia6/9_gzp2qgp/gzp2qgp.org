From what I remember, there are 3 cases in Canon where a wizard manage to detect that someone has been victim of a memory char, and manage to find the true memory. First you have Voldemort, that discover Barty Crouch Jr survival thanks to Bertha Jorkins, even after Crouch Sr oblivated her. And then you have Dumbledore who managed to find traces of Memory Charms in both the mind of Morfin Gaunt, and the House Elf that served Mrs. Smith (forgot the name).

But, while it is technically possible to detect a Memory Charm, I doubt Mrs Pomfrey would be capable of it (at least in Canon). Outside of the fact that Dumbledore and Voldemort are both Master of the Mind Arts while Pomfrey is not (it is implied in OotP that Snape had to teach Harry Occlumency because he was the only person able to do it in the castle outside of Dumbledore), but also because they had special circumstances. In Voldemort case, he was examining every memory of Bertha Jerkins, pretty much discovering the Memory Charm by hasard (and breaking her mind in the process). As for Dumbledore, he only found the Oblivation's traces because he was looking for them, years after the events.

Anyways, in my opinion Pomfrey should not be able to detect a Memory Charm. She may suspect potentially suspect that it is what happened depending of the behaviour of the patient (if he acts like Lockart in CoS, or just have a suspicious "hole" in his memories), but shouldn't be able to confirm it like Dumbledore could. But that's only in Canon, and you are totally free to give Pomfrey some knowledge in the Mind Art in your story if you want.
