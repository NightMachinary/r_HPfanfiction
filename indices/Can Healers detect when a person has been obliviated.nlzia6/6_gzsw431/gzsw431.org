I don't think there's a real answer for your question, but personally I would invent a kind of Mind/Memory healer that specializes in cases such as Obliviation and helps people recover their memories, if possible, or their lives after incidents that involve some kind of damage, distortion or destruction to their mind. They would have to have studied every case of Obliviation ever recorded, and have a lot of background information in magical (or muggle) psychology, psychotherapy, or physiatry (these are what comes to mind) and probably have a lot of knowledge and application of the Mind Arts.

Maybe a school nurse such as Madam Pomphrey would be able to diagnose memory loss or modification, but not do much about it, and would call a person who specialized in the field from St Mungos.
