It is canon that after the CoS events, Gilderoy Lockhart was delivered to St. Mungo's long term care, and by the time Harry & company went there to visit Weasley Sr., he had already regained some faculties. Still a moron, but not a veggie.

So, we know a full Healer could diagnose it. We know a specialist can heal it.

Does Mrs. Pomphrey? Possibly. But once the claim is made (Person A rushes in Person B, claims B's been memory-charmed), she could check for irregularities on them both. Primarily, this would be a check for compulsions and potions on Person A. If they came up clean, then Person B could be moved to St. Mungo's non-critical care.

While a serious problem, and one that can get worse with time, it is by no means urgent. In fact, it's even possible A and B would be sent back to class, with an appointment with a Healer schduled to sometime that week.
