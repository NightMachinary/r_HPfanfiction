Hogwarts, the order and the ministry reads harry potter, Says the story has been removed.

Reading at hogwarts, a philosophers stone also says the story has been removed

Same goes for the weasleys read harry potter book one. Seems every fictionhunt story is deleted

Under a watchful eye had to be dropped immediately as without the actual book in front of me to jump back and forth, i had no clue what they were talking about. Some quotes to indicate what was going on would have made it readeable. Giving the others a try though
