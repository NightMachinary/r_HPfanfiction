I personally agree with this recommendation, Enter the Dragon is such a good story. I think the best part of it is that for all of Harry's innocence (and he IS innocent, he still has a 10 year old mindset), he still realizes that the world he lives in is a terrifying world where the magical people dealt with forming their own 'world' by /mind controlling the rest of the world/. It's a world where Britain is progressive with outlawing slavery in 1963 and Vlad the Impaler rules most of Europe and the Middle East, and they love him as a Folk Hero for it (he's virulently anti-slavery).
