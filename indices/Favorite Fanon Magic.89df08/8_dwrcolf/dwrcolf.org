My favourite is Arithmancy from Pet Project.

When I first read how Professor Vector was working with it I was just amazed!

I'm not very talented with maths to be honest, but imagining making up advanced and complicated arithmetic equations which represent people or situations is so interesting! And then for that to become visual in the form of a glowing grid like matrix where all the equations are working together and impacting each other.

So cool!

When the trailer for Fantastic Beasts came out I saw a glowing grid thing and I got so bloody excited.

Maybe this is canon, but I don't think I ever read it quite like I did in the fanfic.
