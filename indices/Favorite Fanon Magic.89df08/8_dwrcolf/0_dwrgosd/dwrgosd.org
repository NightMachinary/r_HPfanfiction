I loved that part too! Professor Vector is just so awesome in that fic, it really made me like her character to the point where I wish she was actually portrayed in canon like that. I do believe the author got the idea of the glowing 3d matrix grid that represents equations that determine events and possible futures from somewhere else though. I recall a note in one of the chapters where she says that it came from a certain book/source (I think it was a book?).
