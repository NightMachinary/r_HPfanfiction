Agreed, the use of divination in that fic is very good. I love how seemingly one of the most useless subjects actually turns out to be really useful and powerful. I especially like imagining the reactions of all the characters who think it is total bullshit (namely McGonagall and Snape) when they actually see it successfully used to get accurate information and do things.
