[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][The Sacrifices Arc by Lightning on the Wave]] has some pretty interesting magical concepts. Some specific concepts:

- a King Fisher curse that plagues the victim repeatedly without abating
- specific concepts regarding magical core binding (I don't want to reveal too much as it's a plot point)
- Pureblood rituals ingrained into daily life: alliances, truce rituals, and courting rituals
- Specific aspects of Light and Dark magic that are only accessible by people Declared to each (again, major plot point, but a Declared Dark wizard has specific tools available that an undeclared or Light wizard would not)
- New magical systems introduced from outside communities while remaining native to the geographical lore
- Magic relating to family Houses (ie Malfoy Manor and the Potter's ancestral home) and specific geographical markers

This series also delves deeply into mind magic and Legilimency/Occlumency and provides some unique and wonderful visualizations of the magic.

As discussed in other threads, it has aged into a series filled with cliches, but the series ran from 2005-2007. Take it with a grain of salt and I think you will find some wonderful moments.
