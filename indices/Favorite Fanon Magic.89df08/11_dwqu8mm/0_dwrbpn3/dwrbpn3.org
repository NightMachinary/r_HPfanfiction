  it's just... I like canon, nonmagical Runes, as just this fancy, purposefully-hard-to-decipher cipher alphabet made by wizards as a test of will for anyone trying to learn from an old grimoire --- it's just a cool idea, and creates far less plotholes with canon events

Okay but Latin.

A whole hell of a lot of the spells that they use are Latin or derived from Latin. So by learning Latin as a language you would also be learning spells - although not the wand movement that went along with them. Not to mention a wizard conversing in Latin would have to be awfully careful.

Nor were they invented by wizards. Runes are also, as far as we know, /younger/ than Latin and were initially the province of nations which hadn't been Romanised, so mostly Germania and Scandinavia. However, once they were in use they were used in various formats into the sixteenth century. But we do have historical evidence of runes being used to do magic, or being used to do what the carvers /believed/ was magic - there's a Swedish runestone which says roughly "I conceal runes of power and anyone who breaks this stone will die".

So there's certainly historical precedent for having a stone carved with runes being magical or powerful.
