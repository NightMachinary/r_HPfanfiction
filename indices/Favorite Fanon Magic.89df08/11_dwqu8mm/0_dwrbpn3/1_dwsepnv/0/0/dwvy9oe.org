That's something, certainly, but it does have to be pointed out that even without going into possible wizarding shenanigans we already have two runic systems that bear the name of “futhark”: elder futhark, and younger futhark. As such, it is possible that “/the/ futhark” does not mean any specific one, or even that Madame Rowling just used the word “futhark” to mean “these be runes” without regard to what is actually called with this name and that thus it means some wizarding-only runic system.
