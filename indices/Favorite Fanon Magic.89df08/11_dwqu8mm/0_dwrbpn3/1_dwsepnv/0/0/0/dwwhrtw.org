Elder and younger futhark aren't separate runic systems, they're the same one at two different points in history, with a few runes dropped as the language changed. Move the elder futhark across the sea and have it adopted by a slightly different culture and it becomes Anglo-Saxon futhorc, which needed extra letters, probably to cover all the word-borrowing the angles and saxons were doing from the brythonic and cumbric speakers they were settling among. Runes after that are either mediaeval or modern runes and thus outwith the scope of the Hogwarts course.

My headcanon? The rune-stones that claimed they were magical writing are, in-universe, right and it's possible to work magic by writing it down with sufficient informational density, which means that you have to do it in a script in which the letters have both sound-value and individual meaning, as runes do.

This also accounts for the ancient egyptian practise of writing protective spells for their dead on the inside of tombs in hieroglyphs, spells that have to be broken by the likes of Bill Weasley. Each hieroglyph has a rebus-like sound value /and/ a determinative meaning.

Doing magic in forms of writing where the letters have only sound-value requires additional ritual, hence the curse-scrolls and written amulets that archaeologists keep digging up. And the now-extinct folkway of burying your enemy's name, written on a stone, to sympathetically bring about his actual funeral.
