If utterly non-canon things are allowed, I must say I like all the Transfiguration worldbuilding in HPMOR. /Unlike certain screenwriters we could name/, I'm not under the misapprehension that it's at all canon, but nonpermanent Transfiguration is a cool idea that lends itself well to the observed uses of Transfiguration in canon, with a few clever tweaks, and it leads to a great reveal in how the Philosopher's Stone works. Also from HPMOR and sequels, the whole Interdict of Merlin idea. Again, "ancient magic was more powerful" is not a trope I think is /canon/, but HPMOR does it (and explains it) brilliantly and it all ties together with the Chamber of Secrets and Flamel and Hogwarts itself.

On a wholly unrelated note, Arithmancy as spellcrafting. Divination in general is somewhat lame, and acknowledged as such by wizardkind, so having not one, not two, but /three/ different Divination electives seems ludicrous even by Hogwarts standards --- whereas a spellcrafting class fills a hole. And having it be a pseudoscientific process with cold hard rules makes it all the clearer why only geniuses (or at least very bright people) are seen crafting spells. I just like it. So I've transplanted how Arithmancy works in, say, /The Arithmancer/ into my headcanon by calling it "Charms Theory".

One thing I am neutral about is wards and runes. They can be done right, and don't rub me the wrong way in the same way that magical cores or elemental magic do, it's just... I like /canon/, nonmagical Runes, as just this fancy, purposefully-hard-to-decipher cipher alphabet made by wizards as a test of will for anyone trying to learn from an old grimoire --- it's just a cool idea, and creates far less plotholes with canon events. And if permanent wards as their own branch of magic /were/ a thing, there are too many things you would expect to see that you don't: targeting wardstones when attacking an enemy base, a Ward class at Hogwarts, etc.
