I have to agree with you here. Canon's take on it, off-handed mentioning of some spell names that don't seem to have a common basis without going into detail, hinting about effects and never tying down what a ward is and what it isn't is far more interesting and 'magical' than the subtle-as-Nelson-Muntz approach fanfiction commonly takes of nickle-and-diming any magic to death.
