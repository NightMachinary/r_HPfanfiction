Because they represent the creativity and dedication of the HP fandom, how many other fandom have developed such complex pieces of fanon, essentially something we heard being mentioned once or twice during the whole series? It's something that we created, writers developing the idea in their stories and readers debating it on sites like Reddit. It's something we all worked together to make, it's become so complex that most people believe it to be canon. In a world of magic, we helped create more of that childhood wonderment that we felt reading the HP books for the first time.
