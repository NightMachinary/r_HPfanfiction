From Prince of the Dark Kingdom - the existence of a potion that was the opposite of felix felicis. Instead of making you extremely lucky, this potion is like a poison that plagues you with bad luck. How things just slowly go wrong. Starting from the smallest things like tripping down the stairs, forgetting about an important test, losing glasses and ending in events just that could result in getting the target killed.

I like the idea that the liquid luck potion has an opposite. It is quite brutal, but also kind of entertaining to read about.
