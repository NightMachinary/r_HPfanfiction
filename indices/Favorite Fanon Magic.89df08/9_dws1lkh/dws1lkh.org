Since no one's said it, Wild Magic from Prince of Slytherin is super cool. Mostly because no real fic I've seen explains (1) the origins of magic (why can all races use it but on wizards cast spells), (2) why accidental magic exists, and (3) how come western wizards use wands but other countries don't.
