Harry's 'sixth sense' for magic from the Merging was pretty cool. Also, Harry wasn't the only one who had it, and it had some serious drawbacks.

(I don't think the cloak conceiled the sounds they made while wearing it, so it didn't stop Mrs Norris from smelling Harry either. Also, the Tale of the Three Brothers is a fairy tale, so it might have been a bit exaggarated.)
