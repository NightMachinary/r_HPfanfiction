I had a somewhat similar idea a few weeks ago (exam times brings out the best of us), but I don't think I have the guts to actually write something like that.

My idea might be a bit AU regarding magic, and revolves around Muggleborns who are not allowed to attend Hogwarts (beacuse Voldemort), and doesn't really know about what magic is. Then one day they are abducted and forced to compete in a Hunger Games/Battle Royal kind of game, with one difference: They have to learn magic in order to defeat the others. No silly muggle weapons, but little cards that tells them how to do different kinds of magic, shields, spells etc. They have to use these informations to create traps, and most importantly survive whatever the evil wizards have though out.

If a muggleborn survives the games, he/she would be quiet a competent wizard in the end.

If I would be a writer this would be a survival + learning and adapting kind of story and not a bloodshed kind of thing, and definitely not resolve around Adava Kedavraing everyone until one remains.

Also if someone do try my idea, or know something similar, I would be happy to read or even help with ideas/betaing :)
