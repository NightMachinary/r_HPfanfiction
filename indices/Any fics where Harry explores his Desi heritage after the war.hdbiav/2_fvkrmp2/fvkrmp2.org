I like the idea because it'd be unique/interesting to read in a fic (compared to the billions of other tropes that are cringe-worthy now), so I'm interesting in recs too, but /canonically/ Harry having Indian heritage? Uh, that's... uh, it's bull built on 'evidence' (read: coincidences and wafer-thin conjecture) so flimsy it makes Lockhart canonically look like Dumbledore, heh.

Plus, I've heard from people in passing that those who are either Indian nationalists or those who think Indian culture is the greatest thing since sliced bread are the ones who rabidly believe this 'theory' (I'm not calling you one of these people OP, just that it's a massive thing with them).
