The "dark" part is because Harry's hair is black while most of Book!Dursley's were blonde(I think Petunia was blonde too).

Harry doesn't have Indian ascendancy as far as the books are concerned, I now finally understand why some people draw him with darker skin, despite the fact there's nothing in his family tree to indicate that. Heck both his parents where white, all pictures and drawings we have of them are like that.

When JKR chose the actors she knew exactly how the should look like, even if she decided to allow Hermione to change later because it would earn her points and it's not like it would matter to the plot anyway.

I honestly have never heard of this theory before, nor have I seen any fic that even claims this, some of them claim he has Spanish blood(because Salazar is a Spanish name) or even Irish due to his mother's red hair. But Indian, lol.

It would be interesting, maybe a way for him to connect with the Patil twins.
