I've generally found most attempts at making Harry an Indian to be half-baked ideas without fully being fleshed out. Quite often they change the name of Harry to Hari, but never change James Potter to something else. I've even seen Fleamont and Euphemia being named the same! The name James sounds pretty English and Christian to me. But they argue James was celebrating Diwali - a Hindu festival.

As an Indian, I get too boggled down by the logistics in these stories even though I was initially excited to see this trope.

Honestly, I would be glad if fic writers stopped spelling /Parvati/ as /Pavarti/ (sounds too much like /poverty/ for my comfort). I consider dropping fics because of it but remind myself to be kinder since I mispronounced Hermione for years.

Sorry for the rant! Couldn't help myself ðŸ˜¬
