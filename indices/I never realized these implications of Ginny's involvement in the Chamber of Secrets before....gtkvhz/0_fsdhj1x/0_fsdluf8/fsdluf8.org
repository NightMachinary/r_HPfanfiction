Percy does notice that she looks sickly and takes her to Madam Pomfrey for a Pepper-up, but he has no way of identifying why she is sick unless she opens up herself. Maybe it is wishful thinking on my part to hope that even if McGonagall doesn't do much she would confiscate the unknown artifact the way she did in third year when Hermione went to her about the Firebolt.
