The experience Ginny went through could be considered an allegory for grooming and child abuse. It's completely normal that a child wouldn't reach out to an adult and that they may behave in a way that seems to be counterproductive/put themselves in further danger. I feel really uncomfortable at the thought that an eleven year old girl would be blamed for not behaving as a logical adult when scared, victimised and lonely.
