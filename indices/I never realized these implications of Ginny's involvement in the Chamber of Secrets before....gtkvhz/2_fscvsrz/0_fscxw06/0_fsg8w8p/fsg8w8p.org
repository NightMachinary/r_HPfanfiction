The books are from Harry's POV. We know things that happened to/by other characters but we don't know the reasons WHY, unless Harry also has that information. Especially in the earlier books, Harry didn't care to know Ginny beyond her being Ron's little sister and as such he has no idea the reasoning behind her actions. You, yourself, are just speculating at her reasons for her actions based on what you think is normal for an 11 year old.

Why did she try to flush it down the toilet? We don't know. Only Ginny knows. You say it's because she had to know it was somehow related to the attacks... well, I could say that maybe Tom said something mean to her completely unrelated to the attacks, but that an 11 year old couldn't handle and she tried to get rid of the "friend" she thought she had and didn't associate the diary in any way with the attacks.

When it comes to waking up with blood on her... I mean it's so easy for anyone, including adults, to disassociate from the reality of a situation... an 11 year old waking up with some blood on her could easily just not process it and pretend it didn't happen or was more like a dream than reality, and since we dont know how much blood exactly she also could have just pretended to herself that she just cut herself somehow..

Her stealing the diary back could also be explained away as her simply not wanting Harry to accidentally learn that she had a ridiculous crush on him from the Diary, and in no way related to her thinking the Diary had anything to do with a monster attacking people at all. What 11 year old do you know would want their diary in the hands of the person they have been talking about in it, whether the diary talks back or not?

Again you are coming at this with all of the information Harry has and are assuming that the rest of the characters all have that same information, which is just not correct. And you are making assumptions and adding things from your own personal POV which, idk I don't know you and it could be right, but when you have all of the information it's easy for people to assume they would have connected the dots/done things differently...but for the most part we are all dumb 11 year olds who never would have thought "I've got some blood on me. I must be responsible for turning people into stone over the course of a school year."
