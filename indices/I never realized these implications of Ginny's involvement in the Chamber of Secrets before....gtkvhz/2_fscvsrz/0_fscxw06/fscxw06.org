If she no had no idea that the diary was related to the attacks, why did she try to flush it down a toilet?

She doesn't have a memory of killing the roosters, but she knows that she wakes up with blood on her body on the day of the first attack and again when Justin was petrified.

And then she stole the diary back.

Obviously she knows it is somehow related to the attacks. There were no attacks in the months she didn't have the diary. She steals it back and later two more people are petrified.

And do you think rumors of Hagrid being arrested would not have spread? I'm pretty sure I remember Lockhart bragging that he knew it all along it was Hagrid and would caught him if he had the chance. Also Draco Malfoy wouldn't have shut his mouth about his father's perceived achievements.
