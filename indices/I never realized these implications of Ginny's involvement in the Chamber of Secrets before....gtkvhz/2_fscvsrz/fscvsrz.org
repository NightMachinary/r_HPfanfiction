How in the world is she supposed to know that Hagrid is linked to the diary??? She wakes up with a memory loss every time - that's what she said in book 5 when Harry is worried about being possessed. She doesn't remember what she's done and what Tom makes her do, she doesn't know that Tom Riddle is Voldemort and the Heir of Slytherin. She's 11 years old, perhaps lonely, and she found someone writing kindly to her and being supportive (even though it was just acting on Tom's part).

The thing about being possessed is that Tom takes over her body and controlling her actions (yes, because she trusted something she shouldn't), and it wasn't inherently Ginny who was doing all those things. Dumbledore said it too; Voldemort has fooled older and cleverer people.
