- Ginny had the Diary for a good while, before going to Hogwarts, she had already been writing in it, and it was already slowly draining her life away

- Ginny is eleven, in a new school, surrounded by new people, why would she trust the adults? It's pretty appropriate to a child to think that they might get in trouble, Percy briefly saw something was going on with Ginny, but nothing else was pushed through.

- While kids definitely aren't stupid, it's rather normal to let your fear and uncertainty get you down, and not talk to anyone about it, so it makes sense why she didn't tell anyone

- The Horcrux was controlling her, she was a victim, just as much as the ones who had gotten petrified, she shouldn't be punished for it. Definitely warned, if anything like that ever happens again, but not punished.

- Dumbledore put on the ring, despite knowing that there were risks involved. Harry, Hermione and Ron were all influenced by the locket, during their hunt. If Dumbledore, Harry, Hermione and Ron can be influenced into doing things/acting certain way they normally would, a at the time 11 year old Ginny Weasley definitely could have been as well.
