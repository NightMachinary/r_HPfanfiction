Merlin, Ginny was eleven when she was possessed by the diary and the diary systematically erased her memory every time it possessed her. Furthermore, Ginny flushed the diary because she thought that it was responsible for gaps in her memory, she didn't know anything about the Chamber back then. If grownups cannot resist the Imperius or a horcrux's damaging allure, why should an eleven year old be expected to resist it?

Furthermore, it is the Wizarding world where we have biting books ( the Monster's Book of Monsters), homework planners that remind you of homework and moving photographs and therefore, in spite of Arthur Weasley's warning of not trusting something if they can't see the brain, Ginny wasn't in the wrong to have trusted the diary.
