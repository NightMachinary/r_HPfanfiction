  How does this affect them when they understand that their sister could have stopped the attacks by simply speaking up?

In canon? Nothing. By common sense? Well, there is a reason why there is an age of criminal responsibility and I have no idea where Ginny falls there because canon shows nothing in that regard.

That being said, she is to blame for this mess no matter if there are legal consequences or not. At the same time, she is far from the only one at blame. Basically any named adult in the series other than Sirius and Lupin, the other Weasleys for not noticing that something was up and her dorm mates.
