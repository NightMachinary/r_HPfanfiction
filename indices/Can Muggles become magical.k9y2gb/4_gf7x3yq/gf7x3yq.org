I think Muggle bit by werewolf would die, but it is possible that some people considered to be Muggles are actually equivalents of Squibs (with a little magic, not enough for wand use, but enough to see Leaky Cauldron, Hogwarts, or dementors), so they can survive. That's at least as I understand “Tuum Fatum by DragonsAndOtters” linkao3(10294436) (of course, it is not canon, but it is my headcanon).
