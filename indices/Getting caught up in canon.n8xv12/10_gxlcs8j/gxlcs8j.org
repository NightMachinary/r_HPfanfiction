You can write the fanfic for yourself and you can do it however you like. I can't do anything about it even if I think your idea is the stupidest idea I ever came across, other than choosing not to read it.

However, I will assume that since you intend to make your work public, you actually expect people to read it. But if I'm searching for Harry Potter fanfics to read, I'm searching for something remotely similar to the original story because I loved the original story enough to want to get more of it... I'm not looking for a Harry who is the CEO of a corporation that makes the low-time journalist, Hermione Granger, his sex slave.

So, yeah, my opinion is that if you put yourself out there expect to be criticized. All authors are and they live through it. And expect even more criticism when you trick me into reading basically an extended version of a universe that I love but in fact I read a completely original piece of crap that borrow the names of the series I love for traffic. Also, no one says you shouldn't write something original, but if you are going to be original... go all the way. That way if your story is good, I can support you financially too. I'm not stuck on the HP-lore. I read plenty of other stories too.

So, yeah, to summarize it. If you want to write something for yourself do whatever you want but if you make it public expect criticism... it's part of life. If you do it for views, don't deceive your readers into reading something that they're not looking for by using the names from the universe you're basing your story on.
