Canon in terms of plot or world, though?

For plot, it depends on the point of change, I think. Say Harry meets Snuffles before summoning the Knight Bus (I've seen this done a few times). A lot can change or very little will change. In the latter case, Harry gets another companion (let's not forget Hedwig), sneaks him on the train, leaves him with Hagrid during the week. A source of amusement and activity that he probably sorely needs. Sirius also gets the benefit of this, gets to check out the lay of the land, perhaps gets to be a little more stable. Maybe sneaks into the Gryffindor dorms, but maybe not. Can still end in the Shrieking Shack. All the other stuff can still happen. So, fairly compliant and not necessarily a retelling of the book when done right.

OTOH, should Sirius as Padfoot interfere or even reveal himself to Harry, a whole lot can change. Lessons and classes won't once back at Hogwarts, of course, but if Harry is receptive, they may go to Grimmauld early. Or Sirius can get into Gringotts more easily. Or Harry can nab Scabbers before the school year starts if Padfoot recognizes the rat in time. Depending on the path, the Dementors might be recalled, the Firebolt incident might not happen, or Harry gets to go to Hogsmeade openly. If--for example--Hermione knows about Sirius and is sympathetic, she won't take the broom to McGonagall, which means no fallout with Ron and Harry about it. Poof! There's a bit of canon that no longer fits.

Granted, someone else might do it, so you keep the essence but change the events going forward, but it's believable/credible either way. But the more that changes early on, the less likely it is that it will end the same way.

World canon (worldbuilding and characterization) should not shift a lot, however. It's hard to keep characterization correct, but there would be certain core elements that won't change no matter the circumstances. I mean, can we see Hermione not liking to read and study? Or Ron not being focused on sport? And the way magic works should mostly fit into canon descriptions, albeit with a couple extra details thrown in. And so on. (Although once in a while, meddling with the numbers and calendar is acceptable, so long as it's explained, given Rowling's lack.)
