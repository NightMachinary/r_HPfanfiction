I feel that given everything of importance tends to happen around Harry, your 'type 1s' tend to either be oneshots/shorter fics or Marauder/Post-war fics.

For the second I feel that even then you have to be mostly canon complient, otherwise you lose the point of the AU. If you think about an AU as a thought experiment then you have a variable that you are changing, but you have to keep the 'control variables' the same, otherwise it can feel meaningless for the reader.
