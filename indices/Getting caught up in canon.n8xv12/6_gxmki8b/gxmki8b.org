I started fanfiction in a completely different fandom and realized there are 2 real categories.

There are the fics that explore aspects of canon. They use the perspective of minor characters, explore thought processes that aren't shown or written about, attempt to fill in the gaps or explain inconsistencies, try and predict the future, and so on. I honestly haven't seen a lot of these in Harry Potter; it may be more of a TV thing.

The other are the AUs, the what ifs, "let me change X and see what happens." Time travel, alternate dimensions, setting the characters in other places and times, different characters survive or die. A lot of the "Harry breaks free" fics fall into this category.

The first set need to be fairly canon compliant, while the second should have most of the worldbuilding details correct (location of the Room of Requirement, for example; or if there's a definite divergence point, everything should be canon up to that point), but can get away with more variances.

I've read ones that were pretty interesting but could barely be called Harry Potter fanfics because there were fundamental changes that lead to long author notes for every story explaining them. Personally, I don't care for this type, but a few do write an interesting enough story that I keep reading (looking at you, luxsolis).
