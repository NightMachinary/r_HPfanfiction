That's true, I was referring more to the former, where readers disregard a story simply because something fanon is included (wards, for instance). The latter reason I've definitely felt myself while reading some fanfics - like, wait a minute, why is it that Harry can now read minds, has perfect occlumency, and duels Dumbledore to a standstill when we've had absolutely no buildup to this?
