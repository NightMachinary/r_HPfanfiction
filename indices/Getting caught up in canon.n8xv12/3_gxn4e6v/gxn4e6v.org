I think there are two very different reasons why readers complain about divergence from canon.

One is if they can't wrap their mind around an AU concept and clicked the story because they liked the ship or whatever, only to realize that it's an AU where Voldemort never happened/Harry is in Slytherin/The Potters are actually alive/author decided to overturn the entire magic system into something with entirely different rules, and the reader doesn't like it.

The other reason, which I feel is much more valid to complain about, is when random things are changed from canon for no obvious reason. Like if the author has Harry practicing magic at the Dursleys during the summer with no issue, and when readers complain about the Trace, the author is like, lol there's no trace in this fic. Or a spell established in canon to do one thing does something else, just because, or if a detail about a character is changed without explanation.

It's perfectly fine to write a story where any of the above is true, but a good writer will find a way to establish that change in a way that makes sense within the established rules of the universe they're writing in. And that may mean rewriting all the rules, but be consistent, which is exactly what is lacking in the types of fics I'm talking about.
