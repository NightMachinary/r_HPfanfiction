Fair enough. I guess I'm just coming from the mindset that there is only so many things you can do in fanfiction that can remain canon compliant before people start beating dead horses. I would feel so limited if I left myself to the mercies of canon compliancy.

The biggest benefit I see in fanfiction is the freedom to deviate from the trodden path.

The fanfiction I am currently writing uses all the same characters and some of the main events from canon, but I have diverged from canon in a LOT of major ways from the very beginning. I have it set up where harry was still raised by the dursleys, but he doesn't know how he came to be in their care. His parents were good while they were in school but through poor choice in friends and their susceptibility to propoganda, they became death eaters at the end (harry is not and will not be a death eater). They eventually betrayed voldemort, but not because they switched sides again, but out of mutiny, and they died for it, neutering voldemort magically as they did so. This allows me to write a harry that is hated on both sides of the political isle and must forge a life for himself. No chosen one. No instant popularity. No prophesies, no horcruxes. Just harry potter with a dark lord that wants to use him to reverse the binding placed on his magic and then kill him.

I've placed children of death eaters in every house, just as I've placed non death eaters in every house because I don't understand how only one house can have death eaters, it makes no sense. I've made other changes as well.

It's going to be a really, really cool story with everything I have planned
