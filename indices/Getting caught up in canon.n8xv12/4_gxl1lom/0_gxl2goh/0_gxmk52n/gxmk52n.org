It depends though. I only write canon compliant stories. I can't write AU's I'm not imaginative enough.

But I try to take unseen scenes and see what those would be. So how did Amelia Bones die? Or Fudge meeting Sirius in Azkaban? Or Sirius getting into the tower.

All canon compliant but a story we never got to see in the books that's all.
