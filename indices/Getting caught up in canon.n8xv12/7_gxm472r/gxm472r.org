I mean, yes and no.

Some people do get caught up in canon for whatever reason and want fanfic to be canon compliant for whatever reason, but that's just as valid as someone going "Y'know what I wanna read? Snape as the main dancer in a drag-queen strip club by night and struggling barista-writing-a-screenplay by day taking new-to-drag Draco under his wing while he pursues his dream of becoming a professional cheesemonger-haberdasher".

Personally, I find there's plenty of place for both types of fic on my reading list. Sometimes I wanna read something that feels like Rowling wrote it, other times I wanna read the bastard narrative-offspring of a giggly fourteen year old One Direction Fan and a kid who's just discovered Nietzsche. It's not one or the other, it's both!

So long as you don't just copy something else directly, anything can be interesting. It's not about what story you tell, it's all about how you tell it. :)
