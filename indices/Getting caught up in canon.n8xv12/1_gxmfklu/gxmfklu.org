Sure you can change many things from canon, but you better explain them well and don't have them coming out of nowhere.

--------------

However, the absolutely worst you can do is change a bunch of things like characters' personality, their abilities, the world building, and the magic system, but then still have Harry fall to Wormtail in that Graveyard, or rehash every damn canon stations.

I know one fic that has Sirius raising Harry and the author writes well, but then after Harry goes to Hogwarts, every year is basically a canon plot repeat.

Just fuck that!
