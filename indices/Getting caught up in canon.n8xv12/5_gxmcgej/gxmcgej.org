And I've never understood people who say "it's fanfiction, I can do whatever I want."

I, and many other people, want stories that explore worlds and characters we already like. If/when we want new worlds and characters, we can read original fiction. And when authors make small changes that don't really matter, it usually feels more like they just don't know about, don't care about, or couldn't be bothered to check the source material. And that makes me less interested in reading what they're writing.
