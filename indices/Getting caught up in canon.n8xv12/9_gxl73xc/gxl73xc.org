I agree. Like I filet that people have their preferences for fic but there are so so many Harry Potter fics in the world, like why so they feel the need to be so loud in people's comments, just go read a fic that is tagged for canon compliance. If a fic is canon compliant people generally say so in the tags or synopsis

It genuinely baffles me when people leave comments like that, like no one is forcing you to read the AU, lmao
