I always feel the need to point out the implementation of the statue of Secrecy in threads like this. Before it wizards and witches likely lived amongst muggles but enjoying a better quality of life. When, at the beginning of the 1700s they diverged then that was before most of the major developments that make up everyday life today. When they separated they had solved problems for thousands of years that muggles were still struggling with. The quality of life must have been beyond compare, is it any wonder really if they looked down on muggles and anything to do with them?
