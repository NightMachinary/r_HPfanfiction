I mean, compared to the 1990s wizarding Britain was not far behind.

- no television as far as we know, true.
- however, radio is available
- video-telephony is there (floo)
- instantaneous travel
- big, international events are organized
- charms that automate a lot of stuff (See MACUSA scenes in the FB movies)

The internet was only just getting popular back then, and it is the hardest to replace with magic, although not impossible probably. Before the internet, I'd say wizards were ahead.
