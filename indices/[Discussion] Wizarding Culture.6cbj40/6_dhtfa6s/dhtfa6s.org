I totally agree with your theory. I also think that in addition to not needing most of the muggle inventions (e.g. who needs pencils when you have self-refilling, erasable quills?) the magical world were set back during the last few decades by an extra world war. While the muggles were inventing computers, space travel, internet etc. after world war II, the wizards were still busy getting harassed by Voldemort. The magical society's technological "stagnancy" is not so much an attitude problem, but rather because they haven't had time to pursue peacetime development yet.

If they were to conduct their own scientific research, of course, I think the tech they come up with would be tailored for their own needs rather than just a variation of muggle inventions.
