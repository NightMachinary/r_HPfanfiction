I was thinking about talking about the tech thing. I could easily see Wizards as having discovered most of modern science far before Muggles, if only because of the ease of observation. But they would not have pursued certain paths. DNA, for example, is something we are still working with and messing about with. But for wizards and magical creatures in general, I seriously doubt DNA is actually how their inheritance works, given that we have seen many crossbreeds between species which shouldn't be able to do so, Flitwick, Hagrid, Blast-Ended Skrewts etc.
