the thing about technology is even worse considering that the story takes place in the 90s and except television there were no technological devices available to the average person that the wizarding world didn't have a substitute for. And wizards are obviously able to recognize if a device is useful and necessary to integrate into society as we see with the ministry having access to cars and the daily prophet mentioning them without explaining what a car is. the knights bus is also showing how they can not only adopt new technology but also adapt it to become vastly superior to its original version
