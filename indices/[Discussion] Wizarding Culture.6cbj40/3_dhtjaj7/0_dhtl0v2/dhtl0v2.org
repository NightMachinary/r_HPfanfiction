This is more anecdotal for lifespan, simply because Rowling is annoying with not providing such information. But Dumbledore lived to about 120. We also know that Bathilda Bagshot, Grindlewald's aunt was still kicking around the time frame of the seventh book, which would make her at least 150. Possibly more. Griselda Marchbanks was the one who examined Dumbledore for his NEWT exams putting her at a similar age. Beyond that, we also can consider how old people acted in HP. Dumbledore and Slughorn were both of similar ages(give of take a couple decades) and were fairly active while we saw them, even dueling Voldemort, who was 60-70s himself. Grindlewald was the same age as Dumbledore, and lived in a dark dank corner of Nurmengard Prison, until being murdered, so it is obvious that he perservered through the unsafe health conditions.

Voldemort, Hagrid, and McGonagal were all of similar age, and quite active, without any signs of weakness, physically or mentally. I reckon that the life expectancies may be skewed by the fact that there was a couple major wars.

As for magic, how can you argue that Muggle's wouldn't restrict it, given our track record? Yes,it is a great tool to create utopias. It also can create weapons of mass destruction and control people's minds. With guns, most countries either ban them, or heavily restrict use, and force users to have licenses and background checks(in general, I know America has issues but that isn't relevent).

Next, I doubt that the mirror is that unique. If it wasn't bought, then chances are the Marauders made them, likely with the protean charm. The protean charm is able to send information, whenever the master item is changed. Galleons were inefficient because they needed to be inconspicuous, but there is absolutely nothing to suggest that they could not be scaled up, nor that the charm couldn't be modifed to do other things, such as Voldemort did when he uses the Dark Mark to give his location to Death Eaters so they know where to Apparate.

I am not sure the point you are attempting to make regarding wands. If the wizarding world disappears, then you have destroyed a society and tossed all wizards into a lower standerd of living, who are incapable of controlling their powers. Not only that, but I sincerely doubt that wandless magic is that rare. Quirrel, Snape, Voldemort, Harry, Dumbledore and Lupin(debatable) have all demonstrated some wandless magic. If you count the Animagus transformations, you also get McGonagall, Sirius, James, Peter, and Skeeter.

They Wizarding World may well be stagnent, but you have to question why. Snape invented a spell. Sectumsempra. It cuts things, and is basically no different from Diffindo, other than being dark magic and a bitch to heal. So if Wizards in general made all of their advancements around the time of the roman empire, then there isn't much need to make new spells if they are redundent. Muggles need to innovate, because we like to do new things, we like to improve things, and we like to make them more efficient. The wizarding world on the other hand, has no need for efficiency, because there isn't any energy cost. Anything new would need to be something esoteric which hasn't already been created.

On the other hand, Muggles, for advancements, have a much bigger population, and therefore have more technology explosion. Up until quite recently, we were playing catch up to overcome the influence of the Dark Ages. Rome after all, had engineering, math, and science on par with 1600's-1700's society (imo, I am no historian). There was even evidence to suggest that they used toys run by steam power, which could very well have kicked off the Industrial Revolution.

But in any case, what does the Muggle World provide? Communication in the Muggle world isn't superior, it is simply more complicated. As I explained, the internet is more or less useless for Wizards, and transportation is already covered much more nicely with Floo, Apparation, Portkeys, and enchanted objects. Could they potentially go to the moon? Yes, easily I would argue. Is there anything that is on the moon which they would want? No, I doubt it. Given the ability to expand space, and the small population, what kind of motivations would the Wizarding World have? They aren't imperialist, they are zenophobic and isolationist. They don't need land, they don't need resources, they don't have an economy which would benefit that much from either of those things, and scientifically, I would wager that they are ahead in some areas, and behind in others. Notably, they are ahead in the more applicable areas, such as time travel, and less so in genetics and quantum mechanics which they would have no particular use for.

And what would Muggles be able to contribute to the Wizarding World? I am not overly convinced that we could help them make new spells. Maybe give ideas for new spells, like a laser spell, but aside from things like that, I really doubt there is any real benefit to integration, and I would more expect genocide, exploitation and societal collapse on both sides if there was integration.

Utopias are great, but they are more or less impossible, and thinking they can be made with such a volatile situation is just asking to be burned.
