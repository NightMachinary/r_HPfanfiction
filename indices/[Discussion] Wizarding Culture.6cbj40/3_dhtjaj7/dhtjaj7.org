I have a few thoughts. Firstly, could you show me evidence that magicals live to 120-150 on average? Cause I'm pretty sure that's not true. I'm sure that the average is 100, since magicals have much better medicine than us, but that doesn't mean their body doesn't break down or suffer from mental problems like alzheimers.

Two, I think you're way off on muggle society integrating with magical society. Why would we muggles restrict magic, when it can instantly create things out of thin air, or maybe even cure diseases like cancer. Everything about magical society is a benefit to muggles. They have incredible abilties which can extend and make better the lives of every human on earth.

Three, you have some misconceptions about wizarding abilities. Instant communication isn't possible for everyone. The two way mirror is a unique device, and unless someone can figure out how they work, and mass produce them, then it will remain a unique item. Protean charms aren't this extensive communication device that you think it is. It alerts you when someone uses the other charmed item, but it can't send very detailed messages. Transportation is also a problem, since appartion can literally cause you to lose parts of your body. Apparition is also very difficult, and most wizards and witches prefer floo or broom, both of which require an object.

Speaking of requiring an object, 99.9% of spells require the caster to use a wand, and only very skilled individuals have been shown to use wandless magic. That means that without their wand, they're pretty much just regular humans. If the methods for creating wands disappeared, then the wizarding world would disappear.

And finally. The wizarding world is incredibly stagnant. Exactly eleven spells were invented in the 1900s, six of them by a single person. In the 1800s, only one. In the 1700s, only three. Spells can only be created by very powerful and intelligent magicals, and even then it very rarely happens. But look at the muggle world. Technology is constantly changing, advancing. The muggle world outperforms the magical world in terms of advancements, and I'm sure that eventually, we'll be able to replicate many spells and charms.

I'm ranting, I'm sorry. But I completely believe that it's in the wizarding world's best interests to unite with the muggle world.
