I think there are two major flaws with this.

First, computers and computer networking would certainly /not/ be useless to the magical world. The Hogwarts library, from the size we see in the movies, is enough space to fit enough storage to fit every book ever written, every piece of music, every movie, /everything./ Make that accessible remotely, anywhere in the world, and you'll have revolutionized the magical world. You might be able to replicate video calling with magic, but there is no magical equivalent to the internet.

Which brings me to my second point: You're assuming the entire magical world is capable of performing magical feats which put them on the same level as the muggle world. I don't think that's the case. Of course, none of us are capable of creating a smartphone. That's not a problem for us, because we have global trade and mass production. They might be capable of producing food and water with extreme ease, or curing most mundane illnesses, but that's not the same thing as being advanced.

Just as an example, let's look at instantaneous communication at any (reasonable) distance. There's no reason the magical world shouldn't have it. None at all. Yet, somehow, they seem to lack it. If there weren't enough cultural forces to feed its development in peace, there should have been in the /multiple wars/ we know occurred. If they were at all capable of easily producing artifacts capable of instantaneous communications, we would see it. Since we don't, it suggests either they lack the capacity to produce such artifacts, or they lack the necessary mindset to even conceive of them. Either way, this is the lack of adaptability and advancement the wizarding world is known for.

So, it seems to me that the wizarding world /isn't/ advanced, and in some ways, they could benefit massively from advancement. The introduction of technologies and ideas from the muggle world could easily revolutionize both.

As a side note,

  Let's assume that destroying the culture of minorities is bad. Because historically speaking, it usually is.

I really couldn't feel bad if the magical world lost their cultures. If you have the means to easily save the tens of millions who die needlessly every year, and instead decide to hole up in little secret clubs and design silly hats for fun, either because you can't or won't consider doing anything even remotely meaningful with your existence, your culture deserves it. The rest of humanity, who care about more than silly knick-knacks and bad alliterations, would only be served by the destruction of your culture and the theft of its secrets.
