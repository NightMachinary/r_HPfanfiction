I don't feel like you read anything I said at all.

  If you could travel anywhere, more or less instantaneously, and be able to duplecate books, that somewhat reduces the appeal of the internet.

Except for the instantaneously /from anywhere/ part, or the ability to search the contents of a book or categorize them in hundreds of ways.

  Regarding mass production, would it be at all feasible to place a factory in a town of 500, which is capable of producing a million pencils a day? It is wasteful, and really doesn't make much sense, especially if they can make their own pencils.
#+end_quote

But again, not everyone is a super-wizard. We barely see anyone except Hermoine and a handful of professors use any /really/ complicated magic. Either because they can't, or because they literally cannot fathom learning it.

  What on earth makes you think that they don't have instanteneos communication? What do you call the Floo? Or even a Protean charm, which is taught in seventh year. Or Sirius's mirror? Saying they don't have instantaneous communication is ridiculous.
#+end_quote

The fact that the mirror is this big important thing that /only Harry/ seems to have, or the DA coins which seem to be some kind of genius invention. Again, there have been /three wars/ that we know of that involved British wizards, and it's straight up not mentioned anywhere else.

  I really can't respect your last argument. Killing cultures and forcing people to integrate so that you can exploit their natural resources is exactly what led to colonisation and imperialism, which produced a host of societal problems and abuses for multiple African countries as well as other locations.
#+end_quote

No Imperial power ever seized a land because the people there were sitting on the Fountain of Youth and knowingly using it to water their daisies. It's far more complicated than "taking it is bad."

90% of what I just said was repeating myself. Now I know why I stopped coming to this subreddit.
