If you could travel anywhere, more or less instantaneously, and be able to duplecate books, that somewhat reduces the appeal of the internet. Yes, having cookies delivered to your door is great, but if there is a bakery next door, it isn't really that much better, and certainly not revolutionary.

Secondly, what metric would you use to judge the advancement of a civilization? They live with a high standard of living, in good health, long life, and without societal problems which plague us. Technological acheivements are only useful, if you can actually use them with any degree of efficiency. Regarding mass production, would it be at all feasible to place a factory in a town of 500, which is capable of producing a million pencils a day? It is wasteful, and really doesn't make much sense, especially if they can make their own pencils.

What on earth makes you think that they don't have instanteneos communication? What do you call the Floo? Or even a Protean charm, which is taught in seventh year. Or Sirius's mirror? Saying they don't have instantaneous communication is ridiculous.

I really can't respect your last argument. Killing cultures and forcing people to integrate so that you can exploit their natural resources is exactly what led to colonisation and imperialism, which produced a host of societal problems and abuses for multiple African countries as well as other locations.

Deciding that killing off the WIzarding World is a good thing is essentially taking a isolationist society which has been historically persecuted, destroying their culture and making their people work for youor benefit, without any benefit to them, so that you can exploit them. That, is bad.

It is the same type of argument one would use to justify annexing the Middle East, taking their oil, putting their people into poverty and then outlawing their religion. It is bad, and civilized countries do not do that.
