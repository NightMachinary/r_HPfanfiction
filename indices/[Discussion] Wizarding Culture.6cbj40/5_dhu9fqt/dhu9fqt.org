  There are three main factors which make the Wizarding World look archaic. Their isolationism, their population statistics, and their culture creation.
#+end_quote

Wait, why don't you address the real archaic issues of the Wizarding World: Apparent despotism, lack of an effective constitution, lack of liberty, rights and protection of minors, social services, etc. The way the Government of Magical Britain operates makes this very clear in the books (attempted trial against a minor without representation, unilateral executions by head of state, incarceration without trial, Wizengamot acting as both judicative and legislative body + close ties to executive funtions...).

I mean, you make some decent points, but they seem very superficial and ignore the glaringly obvious fact that the enlightenment seems to have completely passed by the Wizarding World. Their culture works on entirely pre-enlightenment principles.

#+begin_quote
  so any books they do make would also be competing with books from the last couple centuries, meaning that their ideas and cultural progression would be much slower. Imagine our own society if half our population was regularly reading Victorian era literature. It would certainly skew societal values.
#+end_quote

Okay, here you give an explanation on why they are culturally stagnant. That's possible, I agree. It's still really sad and pathetic though, isn't it? I mean, muggle philosophy/economy/political books are available to them, you know? They are wilfully ignorant...

  Wizards have instantaneous communication with the protean charm and charmed mirrors, so cell phones are useless
#+end_quote

Hermione (a muggleborn!) is the only one we see who uses the protean charm in such a fashion. Wizards stick their heads into fireplaces or send owls (!!!) in order to communicate. Your argument is without merit.

#+begin_quote
  The internet is pretty much useless as well. They can communicate instantly in the first place, and there simply aren't enough wizards to put in the time to make the internet infrastructure and actually make content for it.
#+end_quote

Your argument seems to be missing an important point. Yes, they could do all that. Magic is absolutely magical and they should have the most amazing abilities. But they don't. There's no equivalent to the internet that we can see. No message-boards, no free press (except for one nutcase conspiracy magazine that no-one reads), no discussions, nothing. The fact that we can easily imagine all the great things that magic should enable them do is the reason why their world seems so sad and pathetic.

  Automation is wholly useless, because it is a small population which can make most items with a wave of their wand.
#+end_quote

How do they eat?! I don't think there are Wizard farmers (would be an important course at Hogwarts if there were). They seem to import everything from the muggle world, so they certainly rely on automation - they are just doing it by proxy. Independently they probably would all starve.

#+begin_quote
  How much can you learn if you can engorgio chemicals until the atoms are visible to the naked eye?
#+end_quote

Now you are just making stuff up, there's no indication that Wizards are even aware of the existence of atoms (and I'd wager a bet that they aren't if they can't wrap their head around electricity).

Oh, and don't forget you're defending a society that ostracizes squibs. Just imagine a culture that dehumanizes people with genetic defects and doesn't grant them basic rights: Oh right, you don't have to imagine, you just have to look at the worst atrocities of human history.
