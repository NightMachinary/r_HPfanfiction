I do want to preface by saying that I made some assumptions about your arguments which were unwarrented. Several other commenters were talking about integration, so I thought that was where you were going.

I worded that first part badly. As far as we know, the Minister is elected democratically, and I am willing to bet that it is heavily beholden to the civilian populous. Indeed, the wiki indicates the the Minister is democractically elected through a public vote.

Furthermore, my point is not really whether or not the government is bad, because we know it is. My point is whether the system is bad, and I don't think it is. Filled with corruption, yes, but the actual laws and structuring don't seem like a dictatorship.

As far as idiocy of a population, by which metric are you judging? The Enlightenment did not stop the World Wars, nor did they stop the Cold War. Technology, Philosophy and Reason are all well and good, but I am not seeing much evidence that the WIzarding World did all that much better than the Muggle wars.

As far as literature goes, maybe you are right. Perhaps instead of no communication, it was simply a one-way influence. Small amounts of Muggle books coming in, not overly popular but still having some influence. Given how the attitudes of the historical Wizarding Society seem to mirror some of the Muggle attitudes, it does make a certain amount of sense that it is possible for them to come in. However, even with that I would say they would be unpopular, simply because Wizards would not see much use in reading philosophy books from a society they deem to be inferior.

They have at least the Daily Prophet, Witch Weekly and the Quibbler. Given that their community is really quite small, I think that it is a fairly proportional amount of press.

Isolationism in the Wizarding world is the root of their insular ways and they cultural avoidance of Muggles. Corruption in the government is a different issue. It is like the United States. We have a cultural love of freedom and personal rights, but corrupt practices in the government are only slightly related to that.

Electricity that is used for devices. A lightning bolt and a light bulb run off the same fundemental force, but aren't anywhere similar in their effects. Why would the Wizarding World spend time trying to make Muggle technology common knowledge, when it is seen as a replacement for magic, a way to do the same things. How much of the population today knows how steam power works? I would argue that it is entirely possible that everyone knows the basic principles, but not how it is practically used.

I am pointing out that there is a double standard here, regarding morality of various nations. Judging the Wizarding World as worse than the Muggle one because they did discrimination is slightly ridiculous. Obviously, all countries should change and be better, and reforms are always good. But saying that I am defending a society which is evil is laughable when the one you defend is guilty of much the same.

And besides, where are you getting that Squibs don't have rights in the first place? We know they likely didn't around the 50's, since there was a Squib Rights movement around the 60's. But where is your evidence for them not being given similar rights by the government?

Yes slavery is evil. I am unsure of why that might be in question.
