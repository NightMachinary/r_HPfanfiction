  The Minister is elected, though we do not know by whom, though I would be willing to guess by popular vote.
#+end_quote

Why. Even in proper democracies (and Magical Britain gives little indication that it is one) like the actual UK the Prime Minister isn't elected directly. Not sure why you're making that assumption, there's no sense behind it culturally.

#+begin_quote
  This is simply because we see the Minister being obsessed with public opinion, and heavily dependent on it.
#+end_quote

That's meaningless. Even despots are worried about popular opinion to some degree. In fact the opposite seems to be the case: they are usually most obsessed with propaganda and being seen in the correct light by the masses.

  "We have to be seen going something". This does not give the image of a tyrannical government who can do what it wants, excepting of course the time it was taken over by a tyrant.
#+end_quote

But why? I disagree. That's exactly what populists do: They try to appease the populace by implying that they are finally doing something and they don't just stop with that position when they are in power. They always want to be seen as a 'Man of the people' (just like with Fudge, these are mostly lies). It says nothing about their democratic merits or people like Hitler or Erdogan would be the most amazing democracts ever.

  Enlightenment ideals have worked very well for Muggle society. However, the fact that they didn't magically jump over to the Wizarding World should not used as an excuse to destroy their culture.
#+end_quote

I'm not using them as an excuse. I'm looking at the things that are fucked up in Wizarding Britain and in large part lead to the situation they are in and realize that none (or very few) of these problems would exist if their culture had embraced enlightenment values. I mean, hello, the corruption in their government would have almost cost the life of their saviour and tried to ruin his life for defending himself (attempted trial in absentia without representation). How can you say I'm making excuses to 'destroy' them. These are objectively bad things without any merit.

#+begin_quote
  Next, the Wizarding World knowingly practiced a policy of extreme isolationism and xenophobia. Since they had been historically persecuted, I would argue that it is really pretty natural to do this, and avoid literature which not only doesn't take the nuances of the Wizarding World into account, but also doesn't particularly add anything to Wizarding Culture.
#+end_quote

Sure, that's a perfectly acceptable explanation for why they might be idiots. They are still idiots though. You're trying to convince me that they aren't idiots. Not how they came to be idiots.

#+begin_quote
  As far as communication like that, they have multiple newspapers
#+end_quote

They do?

#+begin_quote
  Don't forget the culture. Just as our society is moving towards globalism, theirs has done perfectly well with self-sufficiancy and being insular.
#+end_quote

There's nothing wrong with isolationism. You can have a perfectly acceptable society that's isolated from everyone else. Magical Britain is a banana republic. The isolationism is clearly to their own detriment if they can't figure out a decent system on their own (and don't tell me what they have is a working system, it is at the brink of hostile takeover all the time).

#+begin_quote
  As far as electricity, why on earth would they bother doing experiements with it if they weren't useful? Or even make it common knowledge?
#+end_quote

Electricity is a basic natural force. Wizards still interact with nature in various ways and we already know that Magic and Electricity do influence each other in some way. Electricity seems extremely relevant to Magic. Not to mention that they probably want to protect their houses from lightning strikes, no? Understanding electricity might be a good idea...

#+begin_quote
  We don't exactly have the moral high ground regarding discrimination. Basically everyone has done it, and for less reasons than the wizards did. Racism and homophobia? Their culture is different than ours, so lets enslave them and christianize them. A book some dude wrote thousands of years ago says that gays are evil and of the devil? Lets go ahead and persecute them.
#+end_quote

Hm, not sure why you're going into a tangent about colonialization. The separation of muggle and wizard world seems very necessary. They have need for reforms from the inside (just like all modern western societies have done).

#+begin_quote
  Comparatively speaking, their brand of discrimination makes more sense then our own. Not that it is right, but trying to argue that their side is evil is the pot calling the kettle black.
#+end_quote

Slavery is evil.
