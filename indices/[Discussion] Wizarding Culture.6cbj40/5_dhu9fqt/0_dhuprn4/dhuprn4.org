It is an interesting point you make in the beginning, and I won't deny that the government is certainly shady. However, is that a result of being filled with corruption, or was it because the government was set up wrong in the first place. Ministry employees seem to be a typical bureaucracy, not elected positions, but more based on merit. The Minister is elected, though we do not know by whom, though I would be willing to guess by popular vote. This is simply because we see the Minister being obsessed with public opinion, and heavily dependent on it. They have the papers spewing out propaganda, discrediting others such as Dumbledore and Harry, and give the impression that their grasp on power is really quite tenuous and dependent on their constituents. "We have to be seen going something". This does not give the image of a tyrannical government who can do what it wants, excepting of course the time it was taken over by a tyrant.

Enlightenment ideals have worked very well for Muggle society. However, the fact that they didn't magically jump over to the Wizarding World should not used as an excuse to destroy their culture.

Next, the Wizarding World knowingly practiced a policy of extreme isolationism and xenophobia. Since they had been historically persecuted, I would argue that it is really pretty natural to do this, and avoid literature which not only doesn't take the nuances of the Wizarding World into account, but also doesn't particularly add anything to Wizarding Culture.

Protean charms are instantaneous. We see Hermione and Volemort use them to great effect. Patronouses are instantaneos as well, or are close to it anyways, though that is limited by difficulty. Floo is also instantaneous, and since you can just Apparate to a place that you can use it, the effect is the same. I think your main argument against it is that you don't particularly like it, which is your prerogative, but doesn't exactly change utility and effectiveness.

As far as communication like that, they have multiple newspapers and radio, and really, that is sufficient. Don't forget the culture. Just as our society is moving towards globalism, theirs has done perfectly well with self-sufficiancy and being insular.

Automation is made wholly useless by the Duplication Charm. Since the only side effect of it is that it seems to make duplicated items more chemically reactive, Wizards could easily have a small vegetable garden, and live off of that. Or even just keep some food in the pantry and duplicate it every time you want to eat.

There is no indication that Wizards are not aware of atoms. Do you seriously think that given a thousand years, nobody didn't think to themselves, "Hey lets enlarge this and cut it in half. And keep doing it until we can't."

As far as electricity, why on earth would they bother doing experiements with it if they weren't useful? Or even make it common knowledge?

We don't exactly have the moral high ground regarding discrimination. Basically everyone has done it, and for less reasons than the wizards did. Racism and homophobia? Their culture is different than ours, so lets enslave them and christianize them. A book some dude wrote thousands of years ago says that gays are evil and of the devil? Lets go ahead and persecute them.

Comparatively speaking, their brand of discrimination makes more sense then our own. Not that it is right, but trying to argue that their side is evil is the pot calling the kettle black.
