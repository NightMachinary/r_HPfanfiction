So, your argument is essentially "Wizards are fine, leave them alone." I would be inclined to agree, if you will admit that first world countries should immediately cease all foreign aide to the developing world. This includes medical supplies, education, food, and infrastructure. They can continue to extract resources from developing nations of course, they just have to use their impressive armies and media skills from letting most of the populations of those developing countries know that they are being exploited. Oh, and rich people all have a right to their enormous wealth, even if they inherited it or got it through a windfall. They should never use their time or money to help those less fortunate. Instead, they should work to create a Utopian society just for rich people, keeping all those who are not as lucky as they are out in the cold.

See how stupid and selfish that sounds? The wizarding world is literally holding the cure to dozens of life threatening illnesses in their hands. They have the ability to end reliance on fossil fuels, reverse climate change, and create sustainable food sources. They even have the power necessary to help humanity advance beyond our own world and into the rest of the galaxy. They have a moral imperative to share their gifts with the rest of the world instead of staying in their ivory towers and looking down their noses at the rest of humanity.

Sure, destroying a people's culture is a sad thing, but what about say, the culture of Russia in the 17th century? Slavery, progroms, genocide, those were all parts of the Rus' civilization. And yet most people would agree that Peter the Great and Catherine the Great and their reforms were a GOOD thing, despite massively overhauling the culture of their country to get ride of many of its old culture aspects because they were outdated and wrong. The wizarding world is massively prejudiced against those of non-human or non-magical blood. Look at their treatment of centaurs, house elves, and in some cases muggleborns. They have restricted centaurs to reservations, enslaved house elves, and there were literal pogroms against muggleborns. This is a culture that needs MASSIVE reform. It is not "fine as it is."

I would even disagree that wizards have little to gain from integrating with muggle culture. They have everything to gain. With muggles on board, you don't need to devote wizards to mindless bureaucracy. They can get out and do far more productive things that earn them more wealth or even just have more free time. The wizarding world also lacks automation, and while in the case of a lot of magical products this may be impossible, for things like the building of houses, growing of food, and manufacture of common items they could outsource all of this to the muggles and get a huge return on their investment. Even from a purely selfish standpoint, do you really think there would be any poor wizards if they had even a halfway decent work ethic? People would be lining up to throw money at them for everything from curing their child's Type 1 Diabetes to making toys like flying cars.

And of course, not being isolated could very well lead to a cultural renaissance for the wizarding world. With more free time and wealth, they would have the chance to produce more works of art. Just like in Italy in the 14th century (driven in large part by more trade with the outside world) they could create a vibrant and vivid culture even as they are more immersed in outside cultural influences. Instead of the atrophying of the wizarding world and the death of their greatest minds in pointless bloody wars, they could focus their energies in positive and creative directions.

In short: no, hiding your light under a bushel is not the best course. You starve your flame of oxygen, and deprive the world of its light. Let your magic shine.
