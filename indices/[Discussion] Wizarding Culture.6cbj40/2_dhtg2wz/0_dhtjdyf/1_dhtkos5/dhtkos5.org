What's wrong with a positive point of view? There is no reason we couldn't decide to work together, especially if wizards decided to itegrate on their own terms and did so in a fashion that endeared them to the public. Heck, a charismatic and intelligent wizards could easily get themselves into office with a few good will gestures and start stearing their country in the right direction.

The economy would take a hit in various sectors as new "technologies" obsoleted parts of it, but other parts would boom as magic opened up new and previously unexplored sectors. The same thing has happened with the introduction of plenty of technologies in the past, and people thought the economy would collapse as jobs were destroyed. Instead, it simply created new, different jobs. Also, power wouldn't be free. Current power companies would be in a prime position to use their existing infrastructure to capture new sources of power that magic could supply, but they would still charge for it. Maybe it would be cheaper, but it certainly wouldn't be free.

In some regions, yes, the backlash would be awful. Being a wizardin saudi arabia would be a bad deal. So, why not offer free, no questions asked immigration to a country where they don't have that attitude? Since wizards would be a massive economic asset, that would make sense. countries that embrace magic and technology would experience a golden age. If wizards don't want to ingrate, let them have some islands or remote lands somewhere they can do their own thing. Eventually, such communities would atrophy and die, but that would be their own choice.

Sure wizards have enormous destructive potential, but they pale in comparison to what we can do now with magic if only because they are so few in number. I also don't buy the whole "magic can't be stopped by muggles." If muggles were no threat, why go underground? Why fear them at all? Just take over and enforce your will or don't bother hiding at all since you're not in any danger. Clearly, muggles represent some threat, or there would be no need for such measures.
