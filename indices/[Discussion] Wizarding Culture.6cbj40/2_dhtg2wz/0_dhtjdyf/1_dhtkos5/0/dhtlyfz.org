Historically speaking, we haven't had the best track record with taking over other countries to get their resources. Yes, everyone said that imperialism was great for building infrastructure and enlightening people who were not deemed to be as civilized, but capitalism and human greed made it fail, and Africa still has problems.

The economy would fail. Full stop. If a wizard can buy a generator, duplicate it a couple times, and then stuff Gubraithian Fire everywhere, then he has just made a company with basically no employees, or maintenance costs, and is free to completely under cut all the other power companies. Don't get me wrong, most powr companies we have now are scum, but they do still give back to the economy in some ways, such as paying their employees. A wizarding entrepreneur would basically become a billionaire, without need to do anything else. He may be in turn undercut by other wizards, but Muggles would be incapable of competing. A wizarding monopoly essentially.

Frankly, the fact of the matter is that capitalism is wholly unequipped to deal with magic. If your country isn't prepped to jump over to communism or something similar, then a large part of your society loses their jobs all at once. We are already seeing issues with that on the horizon with automation, and magic would be orders of magnitude worse.

And most wizards wouldn't want to integrate. Why should they? Is there any reason at all for them? Yes, you may attract some Muggleborns. But the rest of them? Why would they want to work for what is in their minds an inferior society, which has historically hated them and prosecuted them, and now wants to exploit their powers. It is like aid workers in Africa. Yes, they exist, but only small portion of the population would do that.

I doubt that wizards feared Muggles, but being continually persecuted and hated may well have something to do with it. Sure, adult wizards can cast Flame-Freezing charms, and be immune to burning, but those caught without a wand? Children? Muggle-born children? Arson and vandalism?

As for destructive power, I would imagine Fiendfyre being quite nasty. Since it is sentient malicious fire, setting it loose in a city center would inflict a huge death toll, and I have not seen any evidence that it stops without magical intervention. Alternatively, using a modified Geminio curse on C4 for instance makes dozens of duplicates per second canonically. I would be wiling to bet that it can be modified even more. What if you charmed dry ice to duplicate by ten every second. Imagine it evaporating and still duplicating, asphyxiating a city. That is simply speculation, but canon does not say it cannot happen.
