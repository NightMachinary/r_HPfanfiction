I think ultimately the difference is that you see an Apocalypse waiting to happen and I see the potential for the golden age of mankind. It's a difference in fundamental view points as to whether or not we can be trusted with great power and come out alright on the other side. Either view point can make for an interesting story as long as the author knows what they are doing and in fanfiction that is ultimately what matters.
