Regarding duplication, the wiki seems to indicate that it makes exact copies, but those copies are more prone to rot and tarnish. Chemically speaking, it is actually quite interesting. They aren't disintegrating, they are more reactive for some reason. My point still stands however. If you have just one regular generator, transfigured perhaps, and then Geminio that whenever one generator breaks down, you still have the same effect.

I wager that the limiting factor on duplication aside from the tarnish is the lack of magic. Magical items could not be duplicated, probably because the process of magical duplication messes up the charms.

Think about what is sold. For the most part, all of it is magical. Your quills are self inking or auto correcting. Brooms sweep themselves or fly, and trunks can have all kinds of neat properties. Of course, this would not exactly matter in the Muggle world. If you duplicate items, and then magically seal them with an Impervious charm, then they would be unable to react, assuming you vanished all the air and chemicals around it.

Wealth is only useful if you intend to buy things. What would a wizard buy? What could the Muggle world make and do that the Wizarding World couldn't?

Yes, Wizards feared Muggles in general and were paranoid. Somewhat like how we fear terrorists. The odds are better that we will be eaten by a shark, but we are still far more terrified of terrorists than sharks. I am also pretty convinced that Wizards would have a lot more to fear from muggles. Being an elite society which is far more advanced, and destroying the economy would not much endear wizards to muggles. Russia's economy is heavily based on oil and energy production. Having a population appear which destroys that would not exactly endear wizards to a government such as that, and I could easily see them being restricted and persecuted.

Fiendfyre as the easy example is quite nasty. Because the other weapons you listed have bad properties of their own, but they don't go out of their way to hunt you down. You can still run from white phospherous and be reasonably certain that it isn't going after you specifically. And similarly, we don't actually know what stops Fiendfyre. We have some indication that magic and incantations can stop it, but we haven't seen it burn out on it's own, and I frankly doubt it would. If it has a degree of sentience, which there is a lot of evidence for that being the case, then it would actively go after fuel to keep itself alive. Drop that in a city, and it jumps from car to car, attacking gas stations. It is magical fire as well, and the amount of fuel it gets does not necessarily correlate to the intensity of the flame. We saw in the Room of Requirement that there were flames covering everything, burning it, melting it, and twisting it into ash. The Diadem Horcrux touched it for a couple seconds at absolute most, and was rendered a charred blackened chunk of metal which broke apart seconds later.

That, combined with things like Basilisks, and Nundus would be absolutely devastating.

Inevitability is not the argument here. The books took place in 1990s, and didn't have those problems. I would fully expect the world to be heading towards apocalypse though if Wizards get exposed, unless they all fuck off to Mars, where they can be safe. Maybe leaving a couple people behind to catch Muggleborns.
