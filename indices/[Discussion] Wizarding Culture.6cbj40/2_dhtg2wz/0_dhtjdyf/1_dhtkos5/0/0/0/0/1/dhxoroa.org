The best way to prevent tearing each other apart is to create some kind of co-dependency, just like US and China today who are supposed to be rivals and at each other's throat. However, those two countries have such an intricate economic link that any hostile moves on the political level are quickly moderated by business communities and their horde of lobbyists.

For examples, Muggle Britain might depend on wizard support in terms of national security (defense against both foreign magical and mundane threats), healthcare, R&D, and country's overall competitiveness. Magical Britain would then get strong economic benefits and Muggle collaborations in maintaining the SoS from the general public.
