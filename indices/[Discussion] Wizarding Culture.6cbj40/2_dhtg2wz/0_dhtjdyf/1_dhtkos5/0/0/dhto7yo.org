Can wizards duplicate advanced mechanical items and have them still work? The books made it seem like that sort of thing eventually would wear off or break, and the more complex it was the faster it would break down and/or return to its natural state. It's clear there is some sort of limit to being able to duplicate things, because wizards do still have an economy and certain items are extremely valuable. Since this is the case, there is no reason to think that it would destroy the entire muggle economy as there is some sort of limit. Even if it was just an inability to duplicate electronics, things now rely on integrated circuits so much only very basic items would be able to be duplicated ad nauseam, and those might break down rapidly enough that there would be little point.

Most wizards will want to integrate as soon as they figure out they can get fantastically wealthy by doing so. Sure, you'll have a few diehards who won't want to, but history has proven that people will take the wealth and power over the security and comfort.

So, exactly, wizards feared muggles. They were not invincible. Even an adult wizard with a wand has to rest, and since wizards are so heavily outnumber, they had reason to worry.

White phosphorous, napalm, fuel air bombs, and of course, nuclear weapons all laugh. Findfyre is dangerous sure, but its not any more dangerous or destructive than any number of things we can do and have a whole lot more control over. We can already gas or blow up entire countries, the wizards wouldn't be bringing anything new to the table there. Sure, the wizards could do stuff like that, but so can muggles. Since that is the case, why do it? Why not integrate peacefully? Especially since in the end, continued hiding of the wizarding world is doomed to failure. With cell phones, the internet, and live broadcasts, it would only be a matter of time. Back when information only traveled as fast as a man and you didn't have vivid proof in moving picture, it was a lot easier to hide a secret society. Now? Forget it. Once something like that ends up on youtube, instrgram, or any streaming service, its simply a short countdown to people figuring it out.
