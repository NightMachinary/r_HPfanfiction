You make good points, but you are also looking at such things from a positive point of view. Neither our society, nor WIzarding society is at a place where they can successfully implement such things. There was another thread which I commented on a couple weeks ago that was talking about integration, and I listed a number of reasons why it wouldn't work.

For one, the economy would collapse. Completely. Power companies and all their employees would basically be permanantly put out of work. Anything which requires automation could be replicated by enchanted objects. Item duplication is also a problem. What happens if some wizard thinks its funny to duplicate precious metals and crash the economy, assuming that the goblins don't do it first.

Next, you are proposing to take a nonviolent, fairly progressive and advanced minority group, and completely destroy their culture and force them to work for our society. Yes I am sure it would be great for our civilization to rely on magic, just like the American South relied on slavery and forced work.

Not to mention that Muggle society would basically require heavy limits of magic, and have it only working for societal benefit. Wands aren't guns. They are the equivalent to technology, and taking that from wizards is essentially dragging them into the stone age, as if we had banned electricity and all petroleum products such as oil, gas and plastic.

So just to summarize before proceeding, this is exploiting a historically persecuted minority group, destroying their culture and society for the benefit of who? The first entreprenuers to get them as fast as possible?

So next, the backlash against such a thing would be horrific. Wizards aren't stupid, and unless you can provide a really really good reason why on earth they should voluntarily destroy themselves, then you will most certainly see wizards engaging in a wave of terrorism and guerilla warfare worst than anyone could imagine. They can turn invisible, silent, and teleport, and magic cannot be stopped by muggles. They do after all have what amounts to weapons of mass destruction, such as fiendfyre, basilisks, nundus, and the like. That is without even considering what the Department of Mysteries might think up when under existential threat.

While wizards and muggles reuniting may be a potential utopia, I would argue that it would be a global catastrophe, worse than anything anyone has ever seen.
