How can you argue wizards are nine violent on the large scale when we know of large groups of wizards dedicated murdering the hell out of muggles and other wizards? Voldemort and Grindlewald could not have been so dangerous if they didn't have wizards lining up to help them. For the love of Merlin Grindlewald wanted to take over the world and enslave muggles and damn near did too.
