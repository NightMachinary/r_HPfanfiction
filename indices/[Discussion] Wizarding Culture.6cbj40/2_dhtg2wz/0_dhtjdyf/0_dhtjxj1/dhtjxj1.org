I'm not sure that I can agree with "nonviolent". Maybe it's just because they're Weasleys but both Ron and Ginny, two central, "good" characters, reacted violently to their peers because of words.

Ron hexed Malfoy for calling Hermione a mudblood. Ginny hexed Zacharias Smith for badgering her about the Department of Mysteries.

Can these teenagers who would otherwise be okay to be out and about in the non-magical world (I mean, 16 and 15 years old) be trusted not to whip out their wands and start up another round of witch hunts just because they're annoyed at muggle curiosity and rudeness?
