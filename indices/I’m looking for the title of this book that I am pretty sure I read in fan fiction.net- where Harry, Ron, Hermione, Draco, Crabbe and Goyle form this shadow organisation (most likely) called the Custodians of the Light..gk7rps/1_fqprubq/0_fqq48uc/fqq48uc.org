I thought so too at first... But a few days after I read a few chapters, I decided to just finish reading the whole book, and somewhere along the way, I found that I actually liked it. Long story short: I binge-read it and my mum scolded me for not understanding the value of sleep.

I like the idea behind the pic, I guess.

There was basically nobody opposing Voldemort properly in the books except the Ministry and the Order of the Phoenix. But the Ministry was in the pockets of the rich purebloods and the OotP -no matter how good their intentions were- didn't actually do anything.

The point that almost nobody knew that the CdL was run by literal children and got duped was just another plus.

It may just be me, but I personally felt that the author of the book has truly understood all the characters and has conveyed the plot to us beautifully.
