Personally, I can see the appeal of that method to a writer (and indeed I've used something like that in an unpublished fic), but as a reader it tends to bother me. It can be done well, of course, but oftentimes it is not. My biggest complaint is usually that authors use this invisible time period to pull out deus ex machinas to save themselves when they write themselves into a corner. Basically, writing in the "middle" of the fic can be done well, but if there's something game-changing in the past, it should probably be at least alluded to or else it will come across as bad writing.
