It can work - it depends on the details, of course. A story where you regularly flip back and forth would in my opinion, work better than a few lengthy flashbacks introduced in other chapters. But you might consider simply starting at the beginning, or just explain the past in the present instead.

I planned something similar - flashbacks - for "Divided and Entwined", but dropped the idea since it was simply too much to cover in flashbacks (40 chapters once I was done).
