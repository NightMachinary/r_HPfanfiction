This is totally a personal preference, but I love it when a writer just writes as if the backstory is already known to the reader. That way i get to experience the present flow of time without any jarring interruptions, while I also get to piece together the facts about the world as I go. This way makes me feel very immersed into a story and somehow makes the world feel more authentic than if everything is just explained to me ad nauseam.

Of course the skill is in writing things in such a way that they feel like you're just mentioning appropriate facts to the situation, while really you're doing exposition of the world.
