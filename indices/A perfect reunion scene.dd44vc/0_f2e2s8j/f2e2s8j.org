OK, this is probably too stereotypical and sentimental, but I just like the meeting of Harry and Ginny in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3301733/chapters/8499589]] and then of course [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/601124/chapters/1233595]] (the whole story is excellent and I feel very underrated).
