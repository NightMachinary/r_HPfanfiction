There's a smaller all girls school in London called â€˜Miss Cackles' Academy for Witches' and Mildred is a distant cousin of maybe Hermione or Luna.

The Hallow family are somehow related to either the Blacks or Malfoys.

Miss Hardbroom and Snape are pen pals and they complain about Mildred and Harry respectively.
