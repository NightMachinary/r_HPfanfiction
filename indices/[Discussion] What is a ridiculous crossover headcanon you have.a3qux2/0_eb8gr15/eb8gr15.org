After reading "The Wasteland" (an HP/LOTR crossover) by The Carnivorous Muffin, my headcannon is that the One Ring is a sentient horcrux.

Also, I like to think that the Philosopher's Stone is people Ã  la /Fullmetal Alchemist/, with false stories of an alchemical recipe spread around to ensure that no one suspects the truth and tries to reproduce it.
