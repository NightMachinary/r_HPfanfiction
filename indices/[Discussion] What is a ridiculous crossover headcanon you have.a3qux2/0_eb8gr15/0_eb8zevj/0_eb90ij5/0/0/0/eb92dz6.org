No, because the ring wants to be with Sauron and works to get its bearers to Him. Its shown that Sauron knows where the wearer is when they put the ring on but he doesnt know exactly where they are if the ring isnt being worn. At the same time the ring does everything in its power to corrupt the person holding it by making false promises. Its why Hobbits make the best ring bearers they tend to be content with life compared to humans dwarfs and elves who all will want something (power for elfs, immortality and power for men and riches for dwarves)
