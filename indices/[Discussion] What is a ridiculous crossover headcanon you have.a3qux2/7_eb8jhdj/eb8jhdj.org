HP/SG1

- The SG1 team blows up Apophis' ships on the same day Voldemort is killed. Some wizards see the flash of light but just assume some idiot was celebrating the end of the war.

- In America, both the President and Vice President are told about wizards. Kinsey is horrified when he finds out and part of his plans involve using alien weapons against what he calls 'godless beings'. He is seriously the 'thou shalt not suffer a witch to live' type. He's a fanatic, but there's actually a lot of heads of government who view the Stargate as their way of becoming equal with wizards.

- Nirrti is so obsessed with advanced humans (hok'taur) because she found some early wizards while the Goa'uld still ruled earth.

- The Veil is a result of those early wizards trying to use magic to replicate the Stargate. Sirius is on some planet very far away.

- Plus, since I headcanon that the Ancients are just an advanced form of the Force Ghosts from Star Wars, I guess Star Wars also exists in this reality.
