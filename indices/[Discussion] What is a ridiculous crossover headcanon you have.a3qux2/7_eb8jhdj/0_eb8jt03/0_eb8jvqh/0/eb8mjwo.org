You're welcome. But, ah, how does that work? At what point did wizards get so confused as to think their pseudo-Stargate was actually a door to the Afterlife? Considering that A) doors to the Afterlife are supposed to be impossible, so wizards would have very strong initial skepticism for such an idea, and B) the Veil is studied by Unspeakables, whom we have every reason to believe know their stuff.

Also, it seems that Sirius's interplanetary adventures must have ended in tragedy not too long after the beginning of his journey... since we do get confirmation he's quite dead by /Deathly Hallows/. Do you have any particular idea of how it all went?
