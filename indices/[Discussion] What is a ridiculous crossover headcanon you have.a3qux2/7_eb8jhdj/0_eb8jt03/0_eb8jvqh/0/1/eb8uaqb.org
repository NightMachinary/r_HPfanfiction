The actual Stargate was buried and forgotten to keep Earth safe. It's possible wizards did the same with the veil. While I don't consider interviews canon, I do remember Rowling saying saying something about the veil being there as long as there was a DoM, leading to the idea that it was maybe rediscovered much later and the DoM was built around its biggest mystery. Note that unspeakables studying it doesn't really mean they understand it yet. It's in a research area. Something falls through and cannot be located anywhere on Earth: it no longer being a part of this world is a logical idea.

As for the second part, the resurrection stone is the most suspect hallow to me. The idea that people who loved and died trying to save Harry walked him to his death is creepy and wrong. The suggestion is that it's not really made by death and the other Hallows don't work as intended either. Moody can see through the cloak and the wand is not unbeatable. It's a wizard trying to make something with a human's limited knowledge. It's a fake, an echo from your own memory and controlled by your own needs and emotional state. That's why Lily/James/Sirius walked Harry to his death. That's why the third brother didn't get what he wanted from his echo and ultimately killed himself. None of the Hallows do what the legend says they do.
