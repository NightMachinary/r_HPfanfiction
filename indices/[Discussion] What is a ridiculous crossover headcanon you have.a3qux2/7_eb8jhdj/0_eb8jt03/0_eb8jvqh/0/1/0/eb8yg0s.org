I think the Resurrection Stone is flawed enough as it is --- it only brings back ghost-like shades, rather than perform /actual/ resurrection. Plus, since Heaven is awesome, not only do none of them want to stick around the Earth, but they'll have a tendency to make death sound so great that they'll drive whoever they talk to to suicide.

From the way the scene is played off, I think Rowling really didn't mean for the Stone-Ghosts to be fakes; the sadness, the flaw in the Stone is in the very idea of bringing people back from the dead, because it's against the natural order and none of the people involved will be happy with the results, least of all the dead people. As for their "walking Harry to his death"... first, it was kind of necessary under the circumstances; so I'd liken it to family members standing around someone dying of an untreatable illness or something like that. The death is inevitable and it's sweet that they're there with them till the end. Second, for a slightly edgier take on it: they've all been dead for a while and clearly love their Next Great Adventure in the Afterlife... so of /course/ their attitude towards death would seem creepy and flippant to the living.

As for Moody seeing through the Cloak, in fairness, we never find out where /the Eye itself/ came from. It's popularly reckoned that it's an artifact as unique and powerful as the Hallows themselves, either created by Dumbledore for him (which, as Dumbledore could dispose of the Cloak for study, would explain it) or an ancient relic Moody got on an adventure.
