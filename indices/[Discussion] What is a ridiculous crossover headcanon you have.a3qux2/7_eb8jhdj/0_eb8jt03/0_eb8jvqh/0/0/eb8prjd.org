  At what point did wizards get so confused as to think their pseudo-Stargate was actually a door to the Afterlife?

Well, that part of the world has been held by lots of people over the centuries. The Britons, the Romans, the Britons again, the Saxons, the Danes - back and forth between them and the Anglo-Saxon proto-english for about a century - and then the Normans. Written records being lost would be more likely than not, frankly. Thereafter, guesswork and conjecture being elevated to the status of Known Fact takes care of the rest. The Unspeakables may be clever wizards, but they're still wizards, a breed capable of clinging to startlingly obvious nonsense in the name of tradition.
