I've outlined a story with basically this premise - the Ancients went to the Galaxy far far away (Andromeda in my story) in addition to Pegasus. That's why there are humans there. Obi Wan finds an abandoned Stargate on Tatooine with enough charge for one last intergalactic jump, and he goes through with Luke when the empire finds them before the events of A New Hope. Force-sensitives are the same as muggle-borns in my story.

I hope I get to write it eventually
