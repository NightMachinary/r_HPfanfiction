With the exceptions of /Witches/ (though even that can be handwaved away as those "witches" actually being what /Harry Potter/ calls Hags), most of Roald Dahl's work fits in extremely well, really. /The B.F.G./ is another easy fit --- small population of violent, caveman-like Giants? Check. The Queen is weirdly not surprised to learn Giants are real... almost as though she already knew about magic in general? Check. Etc.
