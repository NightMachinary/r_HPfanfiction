I know this one. It's basically a Hermione-centric zombie apocalypse story. Let me see if I can scare up a link.

Found it! Took me a while because I thought the title was *Eleventh Hour* but couldn't find it anywhere. Turns out the title is *11th Hour* (which is completely different as far as a computer is concerned). linkao3(129845)
