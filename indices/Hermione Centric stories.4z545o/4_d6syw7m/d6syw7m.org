My story "Harry Potter and the Spygirl" might fit. Hermione has had the skillset of a James Bond-type Agent implanted as a child (She's a female Version of "Spyboy"). Comes with some baggage and problems. Not too long though.

She's a strong character in all my HP stories, but in some she's paired with Ron, and others might be a bit too dark - it depends on how you view civil wars - and she's not that often "Action Girl".
