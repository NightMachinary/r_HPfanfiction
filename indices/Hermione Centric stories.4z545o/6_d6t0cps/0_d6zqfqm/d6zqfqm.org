Thanks for the rec.

It's well-written, and I've read through quite a bit of it, and I'm not seeing the "powerful" or the "badass" parts, nor any meaningful trend in that direction. Does it get better later on?

For someone who's been raised for the job, she's gotten no training or preparation for being a spy beyond what social skills a pureblooded girl would get (in this AU, where purebloods are a pseudo-Victorian aristocracy with formal courtship and chaperones and all), and she is, overall, significantly less driven or proactive than her canon counterpart, so she doesn't seek out any training or preparation, either. [1] She actually comes off more innocent, ingenuous ^{^{^{not}}} ^{^{^{ingenious,}}} and generally vulnerable than canon, which would be good if it were just a facade, but her internal monologue confirms that it's not a facade.

Also, nothing she's done so far has had any effect on the storyline, with Stations of Canon --- including those involving her! --- fastidiously revisited, even if there's no reason for them to be. (Her eventual love interest and increasingly manly man) Theodore Nott have actually done more than her.

Random thought: Can anyone name a fic where Harry is raised by Sirius (or Moody, etc.) with the stated intention of raising him to defeat Voldemort through magic and sneakiness (as opposed to moral purity and courage), but where those raising him don't actually teach him anything except for deportment, and certainly don't have him practice any combat- or espionage-related skills, magical or not?

[1] I'm pretty sure the only mildly age-inappropriate spy-related magic she's used was a Disillusionment Charm in her 4th year.
