  Hermione Granger returns to England after years away. Things have changed back home, but so has she; though Hermione doesn't know just how much. No one ever said change was easy and in her case it is downright dangerous, but she wouldn't be alone. Not only do drastic changes affect Hermione's life and magic, but she will also end up bound for life to another. Hermione/Multiples
