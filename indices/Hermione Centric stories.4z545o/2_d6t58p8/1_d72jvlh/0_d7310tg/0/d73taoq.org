No worries. As someone pointed out to me a long time ago, what a magical/combat training montage does for some readers and writers, a makeover scene does for others: both are scenes showing the protagonist proactively altering themselves in order to obtain more power --- though of different kinds.

But, the two kinds of power differ in an important way. The power of the training montage puts the ultimate agency in the hands of the protagonist: it is the ability to do things /to/ others, and those others do not get to choose whether it is done to them; whereas the power of the makeover puts the agency in the hands of those whom it seeks to affect, by at least signaling the ability to do things /for/ them, and they can choose to simply reject the signal.

The two kinds of power are not mutually exclusive, of course, but in a fictional narrative, they compete for in-story significance: the more impact one has, the less impact the other has room for. In other words, why would a Makeover!Hermione need to hex someone into doing what she wants them to, when she can just bat her proverbial eyelashes at them and have them do her bidding to please her? And, conversely, why would a TrainingMontage!Hermione need to spend time styling her hair, when a demonstration of human to newt Transfiguration gets compliance much faster?

I think the OP was looking for those fics where Hermione has the power of the training montage, with less emphasis on the power of the makeover. Those tend to be rather difficult to come by.
