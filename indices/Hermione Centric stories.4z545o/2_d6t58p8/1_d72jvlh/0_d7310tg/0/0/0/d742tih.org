I understand that much --- though I don't think the high heels were worn out of practicality. But then, what drew the Slytherins to her was her post-makeover appearance and their lust for her, not power or reputation. That was revealed later.

Now, I admit that I only got as far as the end of the doctor's appointment, and I stopped reading after that. (What got to me was that the portrayal of Hermione was too childish and flighty for my tastes, unbefitting her canon personality and her experiences as a war veteran and an adult. Hermione may be miserable, she might angst, but it never stops her from pressing ahead with what needs to be done.)

Mind spoiling me as to whether it's romance and lemons for the rest of the story, or whether there is a plot, a physical conflict, Hermione actually accomplishing big goals with powerful magic?
