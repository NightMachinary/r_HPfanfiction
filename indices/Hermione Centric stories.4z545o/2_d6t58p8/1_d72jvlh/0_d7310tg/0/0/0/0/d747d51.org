Part of the draw was magic, which without going into too spoilery detail, was vital. Initial attraction isn't to be dismissed, but what came after that was more than appearance.

I thought the portrayal up to the part you read to was kind of fitting. She escaped into her work, left everything behind, and suddenly she can't do anything right and is in system danger of death again. She had reached a breaking point before leaving the country, was able to grow and revaluate what was important to her. It didn't seem too far of a growth from the canon backbone we saw, but that might just be where we disagree :)

The bulk of the story is the journey to actually be able to use her new/different abilities without getting killed in the process. There is conflict, but the scenes with conflict-action were short and contained. Then there's the romance and smut, which does relate to the plot itself regarding the magic.
