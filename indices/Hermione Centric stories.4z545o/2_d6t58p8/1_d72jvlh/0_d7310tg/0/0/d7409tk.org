While all that is true, outside of the beginning of the story, Hermione's change in appearance isn't what makes things happen for her- her shift in ability, and supposed different/more powerful magic give her a change in status, as well as make her as a person more powerful. The change in appearance (at least the hair, which in the narration was the outstanding part of it) was out of practicality first, wasn't it? Especially since she went back 'home' on short notice because of her new condition.

Idk, as a reader I saw the change in appearance as a small story element and not actually important beyond the beginning. But I can certainly imagine some readers seeing that as a distraction or major element!
