Firstly, /are/ there any readable Krumione fics that actually feature a badass Hermione? They have the makings for one heck of a power couple, and it could be an interesting way to bring out Hermione's more cosmopolitan side. Most of the ones I've seen are these elaborate portrayals of Eastern European courtship (based in Regency Romance) with Hermione having very little personality.

Also, there's this whole subgenre of fics --- disproportionately many of them being Snamione --- where Hermione is trained to be this badass spy/assassin for the Order, who somehow manages to forget all her hard-earned skill when the author requires Drama! or needs to visit a Station of Canon.

Regarding the recs,

- linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology by jacbok): currently /the/ Slytherin!Hermione fic.
- linkffn(Reign of the Serpent by AlphaEph19): a heavy AU where Salazar won.
- linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation by Robin.Drew): Hermione as a rational!protagonist.
- linkffn(Mudblood Mistress I & II by JoseHood): another Slytherin!Hermione fic focused on her progress as a witch.
- linkffn(Harry Potter Without Harry Potter by Nim-the-Lesser): Long story short, Hermione's parents pull her out of Hogwarts, so she tricks her way into Durmstrang...
- linkffn(Adorable Violence by Cloud Zen): a crackfic featuring Harry trying to keep a somewhat sociopathic Powerful!Hermione only held in check by being attracted to him from being too destructive.
- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Witch Queen by TimeLoopedPowerGamer): : a non-crackfic featuring Harry trying to keep a somewhat sociopathic Powerful!Hermione only held in check by being attracted to him from being too destructive. (But seriously, Harry is sent into the past by a Powerful!Hermione who'd gone Dark in an AU where they weren't able to find all the horcruxes.)
- linkffn(The most gifted witch of her age by Bagge): a one-shot featuring an ActionGirl!Hermione.
- linkffn(Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation by Vera Rozhalsky): a slow-burn post-Hogwarts Hermione/Neville romance; not very action-oriented, but Hermione is casually shown to be a very powerful witch. For example, she spams Fidelius Charms to hide her affairs.)
- linkffn(Heap Coals of Fire on His Head by White Squirrel): Voldemort wins. Hermione makes the best of a bad situation. Poor Draco.
- linkffn(Strangeness and Charm by Consume): Hermione is Tom Riddle's equal in magic.
- linkffn(Reconnaissance by Albernheit): Hermione talks to Hogwarts.
- linkffn(Kick in the arse of the Wizarding World by Alrissa): Hermione sends herself a care package back in time.
- linkffn(Labyrinth by Kroontjespen): A very Riddle-like Hermione comes to Hogwarts, with Harry in tow.
- linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Prince of Serpents by CreatorZorah): Harry accidental magics himself into a more cuddly version of a basilisk. Hermione adopts him, and ends up doing some badass things as a consequence.
