If you don't mind snarry as a semiside line, this savage serie is what you look for. I also should warn you for it's sexual explicit content involving minors. It's basically the scenario where Death Eaters take over the Hogwarts.

1. The first one is brutal, but it's still bearable.

   And Just Plain Wrong by Amanuensis

2.The second one is so sick I don't want to ever read that again. I'm serious, I was really fucked up after finishing that.

Damage Control by Juxian Tang

1. This is just Ron and Wormtail sequel, but it's not bad.

Cut With Diamond by Eodrakken

Hope you enjoy it. :)
