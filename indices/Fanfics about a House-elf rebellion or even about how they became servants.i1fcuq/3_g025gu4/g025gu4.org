In [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Blue_Steel/index/][Blue Steel by Jeconais]], Harry allows all the elves to partake of his magic without obligation, which frees them from being servants to other wizards, and allows them the opportunity to come up with a way to stop relying on magic from wizards.

I can't come up with a title, so I suspect it's one chapter in someone's collection of one-shots and story starts, but I recall one in which Harry and Hermione tell Dobby and Winky they want to be friends without bonding them as servants, which allows the elves to reverse the situation, leaving wizards world-wide bonded as slaves to house elves. The enslavement of elves had been how the wizards ensured that they weren't wiped out by the house elves.

I recall another story where there was an actual contract that the elves made to put themselves into servitude (I don't remember the reason why they did it), but treatment of them had deteriorated over the centuries. None of the wizards remembered the existence of the contract, and they were surprised when the elves declared that the contract had been broken (I think). Again, I can't remember the title. Sorry.
