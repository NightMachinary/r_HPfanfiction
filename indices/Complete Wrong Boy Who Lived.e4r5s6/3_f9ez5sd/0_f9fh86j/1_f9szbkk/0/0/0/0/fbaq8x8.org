A lot of text for no substance.

If you regularly find good slashfics, then you have a bad taste

If you regularly find good het fics, then you have a bad taste. There is not many good fics to begin with.

With over 800k fics (on ffnet, not counting ao3 etc) there is still less than 1000 good fics, and of those, there's not many good slashfics.

If good slashfics were as common as you say, how have I missed them then? Been reading fanfics for a decade and I don't really have an aversion to homosexuality to begin with.
