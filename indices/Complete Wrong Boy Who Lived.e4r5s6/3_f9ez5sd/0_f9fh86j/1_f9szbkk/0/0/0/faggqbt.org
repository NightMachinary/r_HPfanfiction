You clearly don't read enough slash (or any slash at all) to make that judgment call (also once again it's a game of statistics, femslash is very small in the HP community so there is /statistically/ absolutely no way it has a larger pool of better fics than het or slash or gen).

And better writers don't tend towards het. By saying that you're implying either a) only inexperienced/young authors are interested in portraying homosexual relationships, or b) men are better writers than women (because obviously women are the target demographic for slash meanwhile most men write het). The first is wrong because being interested in homosexuality is not age/skill reliant. At worst the first implies homophobia and the second implies sexism. Neither of which are true.

Obviously it's no secret that teenage girls love slash. But come on dude. The HP fanfic community is way over a decade old (as you even said so yourself!). Plenty of teenage girls are now grown women who are still interested in slash (note: this coincides closely to the decline of Drarry fics and the surge in popularity of more mature themed LVHP/Tomarry fics).

Clearly very few to zero teenagers (male or female) are going to be banging out gorgeous pieces of literature. But to claim that the slash community is made up of only teenage girls is absolutely false. The HP slash community has no less amazing adult writers as the het community (more I'd argue due to the sheer size of the community). You're simply conflating the sheer number of teenage girls in the slash community with the overall number of great stories.

In simpler terms: 10 good fics out of 1000 bad fics is still equal to 10 good fics out a 100 bad fics.

Also, the ooc complaint? The het community is just as much a culprit of that crime as any. In fact, all the complaints you mentioned are equally as prevalent in other types of fics too. All except character bashing, I'll give you that. But obviously stories with character bashing aren't going to be listed amongst the good stories.
