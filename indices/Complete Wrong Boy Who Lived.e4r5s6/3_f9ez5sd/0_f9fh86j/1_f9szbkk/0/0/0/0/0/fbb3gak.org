I don't regularly find good fics. But you claimed that most of the good fics in the HP fandom reside primarily within the het and femslash genre. That is absolutely false. You claimed that “slash fics make up less than 5% of good fics” which is, once again, /statistically false/.

No substance? You've yet to counter my evidence using basic statistics with anything of substance yourself. You have no first hand evidence.

You're only claiming what you claim because of a baseless believe that slash fiction is somehow worse than other fiction. Just because you have no aversion to homosexuality doesn't mean you don't have representation bias based on your fanfic preferences. Do you seek out slash fics to read for enjoyment on a regular basis? No? Then you don't have enough experience on the topic.

You do see how it's kinda ridiculous to try and argue with someone who has far more experience with a certain subject than you about facts you basically made up?
