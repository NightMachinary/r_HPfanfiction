I've barely ever seen any good slash fics, the only ones I've ever seen has already been recced on DLP. And of those good ones, the majority is femslash.

The reason why slash tends to be hated here on this sub is not as simple as people disliking slash due to sexuality. If anything it's more that some people on this sub has some degree of standards (not reading absolute trash), especially considering that those standars are already quite low.

I'm sorry if I don't want to read:

•No plot fics

•Super ooc fics (I can accept some degree of ooc ofc)

• Shit writing (grammar, telling instead of showing, can't handle more than one plot point at once)

• Butchered characterization, a lot of slash writers tends to make the homosexual part of a character the main point of the fic, what's the point then?

• A ton of slash fics tends to contain too much bashing. Come on, it's not 2006 anymore, excessive bashing hasn't changed for shit,it's not creative, it's flawed, it's too often used by the author to justify screwing characters (s)he hates.

• Homosexual slash fics written by teenage girls, pretty self-explainatory

My point is not that writing het makes someone a better writer.

If anything, better writers tends to write more het than slash. The demography for the authors matters a lot
