Hard disagree on that front as someone who reads slash, het, and gen.

Maybe in another fandom this is true, but considering the bulk of HP fics are slash, statistically it means a good percentage of the “good fics” also happen to be slash fics. You're pulling that 5% out of your ass lmao.

Like no seriously, where are you pulling this statistic out of? The representation on this sub? Because this sub is notorious for hating on slash fics and is absolutely not representative of the larger HP fanfic community.

Writing straight ships doesn't suddenly make people better writers lmao. Nor vice versa.
