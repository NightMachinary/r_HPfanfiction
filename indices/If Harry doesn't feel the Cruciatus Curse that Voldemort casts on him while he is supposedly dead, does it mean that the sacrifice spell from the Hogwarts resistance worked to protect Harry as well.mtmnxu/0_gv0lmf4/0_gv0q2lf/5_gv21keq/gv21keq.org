  It's the same as that bullshit about dark wizards not being able to make patronuses.

Wait what? That doesn't even make sense. Magic is a skill that *can be LEARNED*. That's why you have *CLASSES for magic.* The ability to cast a patronus (or any other spell for that matter) shouldn't depend on which side you align yourself with.

*IF A SPELL EXISTS THEN EVERY WIZARD SHOULD BE ABLE TO LEARN IT (PROVIDED THEY'RE SKILLED ENOUGH)!*

Hell, even Voldemort should be able to cast a patronus. I refuse to believe that the guy didn't have a single happy memory in his life.
