Imagine if the bad guys had as much hax as the good guys, and just nerfed the Order's magic with a sacrifice like that. Fucking Bellatrix could do it if she genuinely loves Voldemort. Or Narcissa for Lucius. Or does love discriminate between "good guys" and "bad guys"? Bad guys don't get to love each other? I want to see a fanfic that actually turns the tables like this.

It's the same as that bullshit about dark wizards not being able to make patronuses. Like just because you're "dark" you can never feel real happiness in life, never have cherished memories? What about memories from BEFORE you went "dark"? Or do those stop counting for bad guys once you've made the change to being one?

All the bad guys are humans too, and assumedly have normal human emotional ranges and capabilities - barring Voldemort I guess? But whatever. I contest even that, and I think he could've even loved someone if he wanted to.
