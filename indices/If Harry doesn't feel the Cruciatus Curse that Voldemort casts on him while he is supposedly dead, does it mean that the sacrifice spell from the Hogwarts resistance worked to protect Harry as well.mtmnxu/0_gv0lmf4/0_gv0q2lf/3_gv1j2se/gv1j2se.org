Bellatrix would need to be given the honest option to live if she gives up Voldemort and then choose to sacrifice herself for Voldemort because she loves him for the protection to come into place. I'm also not sure how aggressor/victim dynamics play into this. Bellatrix tends to be the aggressor in most situations. The love protection came into place in situations where the people sacrificing were defenders or fighting to protect one another and ward off their aggressors.

Also, the magic definitely does seem to favor "good" people, but honestly, is that really a bad thing? It didn't stop Voldemort from becoming so powerful, ruining so many lives, and casting powerful magic of his own like the DADA curse.
