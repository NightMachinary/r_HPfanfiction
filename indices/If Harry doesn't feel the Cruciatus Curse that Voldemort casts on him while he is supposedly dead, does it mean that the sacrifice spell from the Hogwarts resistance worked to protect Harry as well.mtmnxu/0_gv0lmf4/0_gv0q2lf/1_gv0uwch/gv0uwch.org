Snape casts a patronus just fine, and while he's a sympathetic character, he's still very much a dark wizard, with blood on his hands. I don't think that rule is absolute.

Who would Bellatrix sacrifice herself to neuter? Dumbledore? He'd have to kill her. And presumably ritualistically - the whole deal: offering to let her live, her protecting voldy, choosing to sacrifice her life for him. Death in battle wouldn't do it, or every other person would be triggering it. ... Doesn't seem like Dumble's style.
