I headcanon myself that Patronuses work not on "Happy memories" per se, but instead is a powerful Magic that is based around protecting that which you love, which also fits with the theme of Harry's Stag and Snape's Dow. That would also explain why a Dark/Sociopathical Wizard always fails to materialize one, they don't truly love anything.
