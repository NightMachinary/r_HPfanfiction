linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution)

Voldemort is dead but the Wizengamot is still in the hands of the old families. They try to regain some lost power with a new marriage law. The DA decides to do something about it.

Shortly afterward, war breaks out across Europe. The french duke tries to intervene, the bastille is stormed, Grindelwald supporters try to take over magical Prussia, the russian muggleborns don't like being treated as curse fodder and rebel, Viktor Krum is accused of plotting to overthrow the government due to his correspondence with Hermione and reacts by overthrowing the bulgarian government, and there's a flying tank patrolling the english channel.
