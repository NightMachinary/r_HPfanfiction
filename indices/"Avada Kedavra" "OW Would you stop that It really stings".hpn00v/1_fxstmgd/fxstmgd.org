When I read the title it made me think of Mad-eye's comment when teaching about the killing curse. Something along the line of the whole class could cast the spell and not even give him a nose bleed. I could see this becoming the Hogwarts version of the tide pod challenge. A bunch of stupid kids running around casting AKs at each other to see what happens.
