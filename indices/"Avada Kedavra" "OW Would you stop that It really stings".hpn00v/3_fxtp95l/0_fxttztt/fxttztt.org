Now I need a story where the Weasleys single handedly defeat Voldemort and his death eaters. Molly feeds the Carrows love potions and locks them in a room, Ginny fangirls Snape to death, the twins prank Bellatrix Lestrange until she kills herself in frustration, Lucius Malfoy is bored to death by Arthur talking nonsense about Muggle technology, Percy is the bureaucrat from hell and of course Voldemort faces the worst of them all, Ron Weasley, who somehow defeats the dark lord by stomping his feat and acting put out that /he/ wasn't chosen as Voldemort's nemesis.
