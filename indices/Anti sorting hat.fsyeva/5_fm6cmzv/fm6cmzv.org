I feel like it is this way for complicated sortings. Hermione was between gryffindor and ravenclaw and (i know she asked but still) she would never have made friends or grown as a person in ravenclaw. Harry couldve been slytherin but maybe he needed the bravery and shit from gryffindor in order to survive. Then you have obvious placements that are just there because they fit (Ron, Draco, Lavender)
