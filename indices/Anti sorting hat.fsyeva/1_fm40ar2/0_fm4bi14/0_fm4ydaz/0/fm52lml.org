In canon Arithmancy was just divination with numbers instead of tea leaves. And Ancient runes was just old language. Learning what a symbol means and stuff. And to be honest I don't think there are many people who would just learn for the sake of learning and especially not 11 year olds. Even Hermione learned to get the approval of her teachers.

Harry was pretty hard working. He might not always succeed in what he was trying to do (he could not figure out a way to breathe underwater) but he tries very hard.
