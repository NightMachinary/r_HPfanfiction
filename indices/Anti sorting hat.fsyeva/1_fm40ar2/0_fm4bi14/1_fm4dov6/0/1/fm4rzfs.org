Maybe not odd, but I'd like to learn it a lot earlier... 6 yrs old, "uh oh, the ball landed in the neighbour's field or our cow pasture" 11 yrs old "where'd I put the curry brush" 16 and dropped the truck keys in the parking lot and they skidded away. 21 with the flu and don't want to get up to get more Kleenex (I prefer Puffs brand). Today, working from home bc of COVID19, wish I could summon the coffee pot from my make shift office (the living room couch, my lap is my desk, and wriggling out from under this old clunky laptop is a nuisance and the floor is hazardous with my niece and nephew playing Legos since their e learning is done for the day)
