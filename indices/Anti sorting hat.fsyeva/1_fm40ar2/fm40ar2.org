I feel like this wouldn't work, because it would just group similar people together anyways. So all of the brash Gryffindors who have to learn subtlety become brash Slytherins who can't learn subtlety because there's no subtle slytherin in their house - all the subtle slytherins are in gryffindor, and can't learn bravery and brashness because they're all subtle.
