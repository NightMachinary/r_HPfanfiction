I remember reading a fic like this. Everyone was comfused at first but by the time the hat got to Draco (who was sorted in Hufflepuff) people were realizing that something was up. When Ron got sorted into Slytherin everyone knew for a fact that something had gone wrong. The parents, students, and teachers were all outraged and the hat refused to resort.
