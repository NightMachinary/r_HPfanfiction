Even if it were plausible, to be honest, it just bores me. Too many fics out there, particularly crossover ones, seem to use it as a crutch to fill story time when they are done with a romance thread that leads to the protagonist sleeping with their current partner. Smutfics with otherwise interesting settings have Harry hook up with a character, them join the harem, and then there are no smut scenes with that character ever again, all you get is one with each new female that joins.

I like smut. Smut is great and fun. Smut without fluff and smut for the sake of smut get boring. When you could substitute the female for any other character in any fandom or even straight up remove them and not impact the story in any way, I just wonder what was the point.

If you design a setting in which a harem makes sense, it could be bearable, but I haven't really seen any. Even most threesome stories don't make much sense to me. A lot of writers seem to think having close friends of the opposite gender who aren't sexually or romantically involved is boring or unrealistic, and I just don't get it. I've abandoned a lot of stories that were labeled with one pairing and then had a 3rd character thrown in in the middle with no real reason. Good stories otherwise, but too many just make no sense.
