We must keep in mind that is is a generally considered theory that the magical world is a bit "behind the times" when compared to the muggle world. Because of magic, there has been less need to push certain types of progress forward and as such, changes come slower more often then not, and things like gender roles, and sexual/marital/partnership changes are included in that.

Its therefor perfectly reasonable to see harems or similar situations as a part of magical society, in Britain or otherwise. Although personally i find Poly relationships more likely in terms of being accepted and practiced in the wizarding world.

Throw in the fact that magical power can equate to "strength", "attractiveness", "success", or the ability to provide and support, and it becomes even more likely that such a person could pull in multiple members of the opposite sex quite easily should it be acceptable in the society (or even if its not).

There are other components as well that could play a factor.

One such example would be an imbalance of wizards vs. witches. There are multiple possibilities for this. More likely possibilities such as gender roles in such a society, meaning more men die then women (due to fighting, dangerous jobs, and more), leading to an imbalance in the sexes and less wizards then witches. Or less likely possibilities such as the mixing of veela blood into the wizarding world leading to more women born then men.

I could drone on but I think I have made the point that the combination of the Wizarding world advancing slower then the Muggle world in culture, gender balance, and other such aspects, combined with unique situations within the Magical world, could easily lead to the acceptance (even if its not common) of Harems or groupings of a similar type. More then likely the acceptance of Poly relationships if nothing else.
