Not necessarily, although canon Wizarding Britain sucked in many ways, it didn't seem to have the Muggle racism or sexism. We have never seen any evidence of that in the Books.

Given how easily available contraceptives and magical healing were, Magicals should be more liberal with respect to sexual activities, too. In addition, with all kinds of physical altering/enhancing magic, I think they would be far more likely to use sex as a major form of entertainment.
