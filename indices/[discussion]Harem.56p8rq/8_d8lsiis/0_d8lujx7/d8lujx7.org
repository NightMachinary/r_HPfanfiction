One consequence people tend to overlook when they construct harems in HP is that if a few wizards get all the witches, so to speak, then the other wizards will marry muggles. Which will mean more half-bloods, and likely a lot more muggle influence in a big part of society. A part which would likely be opposed to the harem system.
