I'm actually not quite certain that it would take a lot of world building. If you make harems a status symbol - something only the richest, most powerful or most famous wizards have, with the vast majority of the people living monogamous - then you don't need to change that much. That witches are equal to wizards would make an actual harem just that more impressive.
