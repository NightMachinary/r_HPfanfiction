  A part which would likely be opposed to the harem system.

Which then would give some actual reason to the Death Eater organisation :P

Obviously any harem story would have to do massive amounts of worldbuilding to withstand closer inspection. One way I did it once was to make the witch - wizard ratio roughly 10:1 - with 10 boys to a 105 girls in Harry's year (I think Firebird also did that).

Whatever solution authors think of, it always requires a shitton of additional worldbuilding.
