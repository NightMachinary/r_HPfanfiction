I always liked the idea that there is/was a tradition of Covens in magical Britain and the entirety of Europe (maybe even globally). In that context, a harem would be the Coven + one or more wizards, with the High Witch, the leader of the Coven, also as the leader of the harem.

But Rowling never went out worldbuilding for the question what it could mean that the "power difference" between men and women is basically non-existent in the magical world. Witches are equal to wizards in magic, but for familiarity sake (I suppose), Rowling kept the traditional gender roles. Its just one more evidence of the very thin worldbuilding done by Rowling.

So any sort of changed gender role, such as the position of a High Witch, or the role of a wizard in a Coven-harem, would have to be explored. In any case, AU's are inevitable.
