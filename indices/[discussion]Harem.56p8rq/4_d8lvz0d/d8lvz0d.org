Since polygamy has been outlawed in Britain for so long, I feel like trying to incorporate it into the HP series would remove the Britishness of the story, and Britishness is one of the core features of the thing.

Not that you couldn't write a good fanfic that incorporated the concept, but you'd need to do a lot of worldbuilding just to get the reader to accept the setting before you can even tell a story in it.
