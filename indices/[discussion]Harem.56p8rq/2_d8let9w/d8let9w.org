it's like that damn trunk and all the titles and a few billion galleons. a story I really otherwise like does a huge harem (7 or 8) and tries an equal/loving/consensual relationship.. it's not successful, at least to me and it drags the story down. could be cultural blinders but I'm just not interested, so I don't read them usually. the trio forming a relationship might be alright, they at least have background. there's a couple of h/hr/luna's that are pretty fun to read but in the main? nah. the energy would be better spent on smart bad guys.
