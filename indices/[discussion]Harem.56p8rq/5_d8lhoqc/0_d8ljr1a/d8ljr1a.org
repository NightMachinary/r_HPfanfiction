Sorry, but I think /Firebird's Son/ does a terrible job of it. The characters claimed that the reproductive role imbalance was a pressing issue but few of their actions matched that. And what I read of it didn't quite match "female-dominated" as much as I would expect.

Increased homosexuality, decreased emphasis on romance, and serial monogamy are alternate ways to address a gender imbalance on a social level. Interbreeding with Muggles, aromantic sexual intercourse, artificial insemination, adoption, and possibly magic offer ways to address the effects of a reproductive role imbalance on population size and access to pregnancy for those who want it, and some of those solutions grant a reasonable chance of having magical offspring.

If the imbalance is toward people who bear children, you don't need to worry about population size so much -- a population that's 70% female will have 40% more offspring than one that's 50% female, all else being equal. If it's the other way around, well, I don't think I've read a fic like that, but population size becomes an urgent concern.
