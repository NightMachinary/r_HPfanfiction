I think I would have liked Firebird's Son a lot more without the harem aspects, actually. Or if that portion had been turned down a bit. Intentional or not, harem fanfiction does have a bad habit of devolving into something that sounds an awful lot like wish fulfillment.

It felt like "Let us take a break from the interesting parts of the story while Harry appeases this erupting volcano of female hormones with his super virile male body, for only he is manly enough to sooth the raging vaginas surrounding him."
