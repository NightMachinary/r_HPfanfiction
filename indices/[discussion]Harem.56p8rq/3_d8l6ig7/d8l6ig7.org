Despite the fact that there are SOOOOO many fics out there that operate on the thought that the Wizarding world was/is as oppressive to women as the Muggle one has been, historically speaking, there's not really much evidence for it. Thus, I don't think Harem societies would ever actually be a thing. Like you, I think witches would never put up with that kind of crap.

If, on the other hand, we were talking strictly poly-amorous relationships, that would be something else altogether. I don't think it's necessarily outside the realm of possibility for them to want to "share their love", just that it would be so gendered.

Edit: Also, I think that Harem is pretty much all teenage wank/adult rich man wank.
