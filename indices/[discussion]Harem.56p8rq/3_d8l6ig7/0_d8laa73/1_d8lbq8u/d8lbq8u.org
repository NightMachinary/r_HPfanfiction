Well of course, because that's the world we live in and the world she's familiar with.

However, as far as the character and the tone of the books themselves, it's pretty apparent that it's meant to be equal between the sexes, since the platform for inequality in these books are based on blood status.

But honestly, I never thought of the only women as just staying home to raise kids instead of working, I just figured they were unnamed, just like there unnamed men working. Keep in mind too, that of course a lot of women are going to be teaching, because Rowling did try to make it more equal, and the only way to do that in a setting at a school is to make a lot of women teachers.
