As far as Molly getting a job during the school year, we don't know either way really.Personally I doubt she's actually employed anywhere but its entirely plausible that she brings in some extra income in other ways. For example, they live out in the country and have a largish garden, perhaps she grows stuff (like potion ingredients or simply food) to sell at market. We know she knits sweaters every year for Christmas, perhaps she spends her time making hand-crafted goods to sell. Just because she's a stay-at-home-mum doesn't mean she doesn't contribute to the family's income in ways that, historically speaking, lots of women from low-income families often would.

As far as the teachers go, we don't actually know a lot about most of them outside of the classroom. Some of them may indeed have families that we don't know about. In some cases they may have had families at one point but lost them to the rather bloody war their society suffered from.
