I think you're considering this is a rather Muggle way. In the Muggle world your job is considered a major indicator of your capability, intelligence, ambition, status, power, etc. This seems to hold significantly less so in the magical world. Molly Weasley being a housewife didn't stop her from killing one of the most powerful and dangerous witches in Britain. And the job which seems to indicate the greatest ability with magic is teaching, which is relatively low in terms of status/political power.
