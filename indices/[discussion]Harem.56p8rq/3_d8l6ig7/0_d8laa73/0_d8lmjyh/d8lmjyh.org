  The only known women whose jobs don't fit 'female' roles are Amelia Bones, Mafalda Hopkirk (the witch who is impersonated by Hermione in DH), Bertha Jorkins, and Umbridge, who all work in the ministry.

There are others. Millicent Bagnold (who was /minister/). Griselda Marchbanks. Gwenog Jones. Betty Brathwaithe. Madam Edgecombe. Rita Skeeter (who is employed as a journalist and therefore counts as one, regardless of what you consider to be journalism). Celestina Warbeck. Probably more whom I forget.

Celestina, Edgecombe and Rowena Ravenclaw have families. Not too many male characters have families, either.

Only known stay-at-home mums are Petunia and Molly. Just because Lily and Augusta's professions aren't mentioned, doesn't mean you can assume they're not working.
