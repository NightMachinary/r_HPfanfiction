Definitely makes sense. That's actually part of what makes good Weird Fiction. Keep it simple, otherwise it becomes too weird for people to get their head around and relate to. The Fallen London writing advice basically boils down to 'simple and specific'. Though that's a tangent I can ramble off onto for days, so I'll cut it off there. :D

Conciseness and simplicity are some of the hardest Writing Virtues to learn, you're definitely right there. I like the way you put it though, that simplicity 'eases you into the more complex parts of the story'. It's like layering, right? You start off with a simple foundation, then build more and more onto it until you've got a house that Edith Finch's family would be envious of.
