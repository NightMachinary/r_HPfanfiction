“Tom Riddle first met Death on the train to Hogwarts, although he did not know it at the time.” This is the first sentence from the story October by The_Carnivorous_Muffin Again there is this sort of simplicity to it that grips you and eases you in to more complex parts of the story. In my opinion being able to explain and write things in a simple way is an art form and very difficult. But if you're able to attract the readers attention with a short and simple beginning everything else is secondary. This doesn't mean that I don't love descriptive or flowery language in fact I love it. However, in my opinion even if you're going to be descriptive in your story the reader should be able to tie things up in their mind, meaning that however absurd your world is there should be a few loose rules to not divert the attention. Idk does that make sense?
