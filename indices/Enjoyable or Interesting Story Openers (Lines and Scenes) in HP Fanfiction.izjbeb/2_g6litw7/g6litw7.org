From my favorite WBWL fic, *Subversion* by Myricle. It tells you all you need to know about the story in three paragraphs. The entire fic is superbly written; such a shame it's abandoned.

  When the World Cup Disaster began, I was sitting in the Top Box with the Minister of Magic shrieking in the seat beside me.

  On my left, Draco Malfoy followed the game with an intensity and enthusiasm that he rarely allowed himself to display. Beyond him, Theodore Nott had barely taken his Omnioculars from his head since the game began, though he seemed to divide his attention between the players and the crowd, enjoying the opportunity for unrestricted people-watching. Theo was never as into Quidditch as most boys our age seemed to be, and I had worried beforehand that he might get bored. When I noticed the amusement on Theo's face, a part of me relaxed.

  In the lowest seats of the Top Box, my twin brother Jim was screaming up a storm, and the Weasleys and Uncle Padfoot were cheering right along with him. I liked the Weasleys well enough, and I loved Uncle Padfoot, but four years after being Sorted into Slytherin, I knew my crowd. They understood.
