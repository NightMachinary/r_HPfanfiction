Indeed. That's the delight of Lovecraftian Horror, and kind of psychological horror in general. To paraphrase Alan Wake (who IIRC was quoting Stephen King?), it's the unanswered questions in the beginning that keep us reading in hope of finding the answers, not the Lore Dumps.

That's kinda part and parcel of the Cosmic Horror genre, and definitely a reason I love it too. The utterly alien is fascinating to try investigate like that, really grabs hold of my curiosity and intrigue. And the surrounding universe always interested me as well - the sheer expanse of it all and the integration and dynamics of it into the greater whole, filtered through our limited perceptions and understandings. Especially the old Victoriana Psychology stuff the older-setting stories try to integrate - that interests me on a professional standpoint too. The idea that there's such a thing as too sane. Quite odd to contemplate. :)

I do enjoy the opposite end of Cosmic Horror too, actually. Things like the Fallen London series or the Laundry Files series, or even Welcome to Nightvale. The kind of 'daily-grind'-ification of the abstract weirdness is utterly fascinating too. Like not having an Elder God hiding in your toolshed is the weirder option. :D
