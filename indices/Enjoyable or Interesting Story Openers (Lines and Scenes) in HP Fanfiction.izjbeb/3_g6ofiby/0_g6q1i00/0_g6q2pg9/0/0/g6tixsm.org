Wow now I want to steal your reading list! You explain things so eloquently! I love Night Vale but haven't heard of the “fallen London series” and Laundry files series so I'm excited to check it out! If you like cosmic horror or even horror in general I would really really recommend you the podcast the Magnus archives it's absolutely fantastic and everything you explained that you enjoyed is definitely in there! Even my username is named after on of the characters.
