Oh my God you're so cool and lucky! Honestly I'm pretty much open to everything! I don't know everything about steampunk but there is a book called Mechanique: a tale of the Circus Tresaulti by Genevive Valentine it's about a steampunk dystopian future were a mechanical circus is at war within. It might interest you. Also do you like sci-fi specifically authors like Philip K Dick? Because if you like stuff like cosmic horror and the transcendence of reality. I think you will really really like the book Ubik which deals with the crumbling of reality as we know. Anyways thank you for taking the time to write all your insightful comments Now I have so much to check out and I'm very excited!
