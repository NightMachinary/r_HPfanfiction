I don't know about the first, but I definitely agree with the second. He was such a delightfully nice guy to a heavily fangirling teenager.

I have not read either of those things, but they both sound right up my street. I'm a big Philip K Dick fan, though I've only read Man in the High Castle and Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, so I'm pretty sure I'll like that. Genevieve Valentine is such a cool name, too. Definitely sounds like the sort of person who'd write stories about a steampunk circus. :D
