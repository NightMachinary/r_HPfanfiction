Thank you! I volunteer in a lot of roles where explaining stuff is a vital skill, so I'm glad to hear I still got it. :)

Fallen London is a series of Video Games (Fallen London, Sunless Sea, and Sunless Skies) about if Victorian London got stolen by bats and dragged into an underwater cave where things are Weird. They're incredibly good Weird Fiction. The first one is a free interactive fiction browser game, the latter two are more actively interactive in the traditional video gaming sense.

The Laundry Files is a published novel series by Charles Stross that basically asks what it would be like if the British Civil Service had a department to deal with Cthulhu. It does turn incantation into mathematics and technical science a bit too much in places, but it also has pentagrams made of electricity and lasers because of it, so I forgive it that indulgence. :)

You have good taste, The Magnus Archives is great, though it really requires you listen to catch everything and get the atmosphere and I haven't been able to find the time to stay caught up. I'm still somewhere near the end of Season One. Life shit, y'know? :)

I've actually met Jonathan Sims a couple times at the Edinburgh Fringe - he was part of a Steampunk Storytelling band called The Mechanisms. Basically, they took old myths and folklore and turned them steampunk (eg. the tale of Ulysses becomes a film-noir-ish interrogation about the passcode to a vault by shadowy minions of powerful families ruling a planet-city), then sung about them in a very burlesque sort of fashion. I'd thoroughly recommend you youtube them, they're fantastic if you're even vaguely into Steampunk.
