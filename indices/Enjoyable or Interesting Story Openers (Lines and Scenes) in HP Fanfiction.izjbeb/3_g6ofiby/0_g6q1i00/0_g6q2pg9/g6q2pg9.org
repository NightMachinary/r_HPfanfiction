Aghhh Finally someone else who enjoys Lovecraftian Horror !! What I also like about the beginning of this fic is the ambiguity of it all. A lot of authors start with an info dump that will really deter me from even trying to read it. But explaining just enough to entice and holding that bit of mystery throughout the story really is the thing that really makes me stick with a story. Showing less makes the imagination go wild and I wish more people did that. I want to be just as curious as the protagonist of the story be confused, gripped, excited, nervous. But when the narrative structure just explains everything in great detail in terms of exposition it makes me stop right from the beginning. The monsters are vaguely explained in the story “Eyes” but never enough to actually draw a clear picture. Always just out of reach in the shadows but still overbearing in its presence. So indescribable that it transcends. Which is what I like about Lovecraftian horror and why I prefer it to Gothic or slasher stories. It's so vast and awe inspiring that you can't even explain it.
