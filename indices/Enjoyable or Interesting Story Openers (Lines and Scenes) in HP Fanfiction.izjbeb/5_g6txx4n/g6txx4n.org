“I remember waking on the day before the end of the world.”

The story is called Countdown by Silens Cursor and it's a one shot. How can this first sentence not intrigue someone?

“These are the last words of a dying universe. My name is Harry Potter and I just destroyed everything; space, time, space-time, matter, dark matter, anti-matter, all twenty-six dimensions of our fragile little world in the twinkling of an eye. The fabric of creation peeled apart, cut to ribbons under the blade of my will, wrenched apart particle by particle. They gave me a universe and I reduced it to dust. Accidentally, of course.”

Also this story called The Sun Dog written by enembee The accidentally of course part really does it foe me with it because it reminds me of hitchikers guide to the galaxy.
