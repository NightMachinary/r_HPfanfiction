I feel like I'm probably one of the few people who actually like Fleamont and Euphemia. In fact, I like the new info on the Potter family tree, mostly. I find it hilarious about the hair potion thing.

I like the idea of Charlus being like a cousin or something to Fleamont, though. And I wish we knew more about Dorea and Charlus over all.
