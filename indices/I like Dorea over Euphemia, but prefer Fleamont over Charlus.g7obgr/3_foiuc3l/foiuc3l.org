Charlus is a stupid name. I'm aware that one or two real examples exist, but it sounds like someone lazily tried to make the name "Charles" sound Latin. Like Johnus, or Stevus, or Jeffus or something like that.

Fleamont is also a stupid name, but it's stupid in a funny and interesting way. Fits perfectly with the Harry Potter setting. Angsty fanfic authors who want everything to be superserious and grimdark won't like it, of course.

Euphemia is also an excellent name in the setting. It's well-known but old-fashioned, so you'd encounter it often in history books but never meet anyone called that. Fits with lots of other wizarding names.

Dorea, according to wikipedia, "is a Gram-positive and nonspore-forming bacterial genus from the family Lachnospiraceae, which occur in human faeces."
