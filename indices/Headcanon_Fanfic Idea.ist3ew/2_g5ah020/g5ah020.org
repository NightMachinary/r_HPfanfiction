I assume you'll get similar feedback to this: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ismnna/headcanonfanfic_idea_originally_posted_on/]].

To reiterate the main ideas of those who commented that I agree with, it feels like you're trying to solve problems that don't exist and create flaws where there aren't any. As Sercoat notes, the three OCs find this information, hand it over, and then are surprised when HRH do things with it? And you're giving the canonical main characters flaws so that your OCs look better?

Calling it an AU does not excuse inconsistencies within a story.

And of course, your introduction makes me think you're only looking for praise, not actual feedback.
