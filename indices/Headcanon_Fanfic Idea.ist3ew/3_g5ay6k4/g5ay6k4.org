  Angeli is a sweet, Hufflepuff, muggleborn, Muslim girl. Her father is a bit abusive and possibly an alcoholic, which led to some trauma and general shyness.

I am a bit confused about that point. Is the father also a Muslim or did she get the religion from her mother?\\
Because while it's technically possible, it is a bit strange to make an alcoholic of someone from the one religion that forbid alcohol, and not something I have ever read about.

For the rest, I don't really have much interest for this prompt. It's doesn't change anything from canon, except that, rather than being the hero of the story, the MC are a bunch of morons unable to solve the mysteries by themselves, and who steal the "limelight" from your OC by not giving them the credit they "deserve".
