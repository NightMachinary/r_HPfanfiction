Is is just minor subplot in the series “[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts by Forest_of_Holly]]“, but the main character befriends Snape in the very critical life-threatening situation, and she is since that moment his fanatic fangirl. And everybody who knew him long time are like “Snape? Really? Awesome? Are you sure we talk about the same person?” Perhaps not for this subplot, but generally the series is great in my opinion.
