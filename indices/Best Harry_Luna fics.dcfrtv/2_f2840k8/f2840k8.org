As was recommended, Arpad Hrunta is a safe bet, his fics are amazing.

Another author to recommend is JJ Rust, he has a lot of short Harry/Luna stories from a bygone age. linkffn(4390341) - this is one of them, there are a lot more.

There is Firebird's Trilogy if you want be depressed, since it's Darth Marrs - linkffn(8629685)

Quidditch World Cup is a nice one - linkffn(6862426)

Learning to Love Good - it's just a classic, which I have a fondness for linkffn(7284443)

Same with Luna's Hubby - linkffn(2919503) <<< ^^^ those two are probably not the BEST, but they were staples in the dry Luna/Harry well, back in the day.

Birth of Bardic Magic, because I love magic based on music, it clicks with me - linkffn(7971405)

She Who Hesitates, we need some fluff and smut in our lives from time to time - linkffn(7524855)

And finally To Get a Date, this is jlluh, so expect wackiness and fun - linkffn(12629461)
