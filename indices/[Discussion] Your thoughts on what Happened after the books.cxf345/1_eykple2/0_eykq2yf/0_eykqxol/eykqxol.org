According to [[https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/theatre/a-brutal-dark-time-real-life-heartache-behind-harry-potter-play-20190521-p51pkb.html][this article that I read,]] the playwrights were given advice straight from JKR's mouth on how to write and portray her characters, but ignored it to project their own issues into the character dynamics. So it's not like they didn't /understand/ the characters from the book, they just didn't care.

  While writing the script for Cursed Child, Jack Thorne endured a private agony. 'Every aspect of the show,' he says, 'is infected by that.'

  In Cursed Child, the now-adult Harry is bewildered by the prickly defensiveness of his teenage son, Albus. He tries to talk some sense into the boy -- and when that fails, he shouts something that sucks the air out of the room.

  "One of the notes I got given was, 'Make sure Harry is still likeable', so I cut that scene entirely," Thorne says. "Then John goes, 'Where the hell is this scene?' and he put it back in ... I think it's a scene parents really relate to."

.

That scene that parents relate to is the famous Yelling Harry one.

    *HARRY (seeing red):* Well, there are times I wish you weren't my son.

    *There's a silence. ALBUS nods. Pause. HARRY realizes what he's said.*

    *HARRY:* No, I didn't mean that . . .

    *ALBUS:* Yes. You did.
