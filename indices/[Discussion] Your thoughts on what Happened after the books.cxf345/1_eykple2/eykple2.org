Ron and Hermione go to marriage counseling after Ron reveals he was so drunk at their wedding he couldn't remember it, and admits he has a problem with alcoholism, which led him to give Albus a love potion as a gift. As a result of her parents' possible divorce, their daughter Rose tries to get their attention by acting up at school and bullying her cousin Albus for being in Slytherin.

And now to blow your mind: /it's based off Cursed Child canon./

  *HERMIONE:* Ron, whatever this is, I've got ten minutes until the goblins show up to talk security at Gringotts ---

  *RON:* I mean, we've been together so long --- and married for so long --- I mean, so long ---

  *HERMIONE:* If this is your way of saying you want a marital break, Ron, then, to be clear, I will skewer you with this quill.

  *RON:* Shut up. Will you shut up for once? I want to do one of those marriage renewal things I've read about. Marriage renewal. What do you think?

  *HERMIONE (melting):* You want to marry me again?

  *RON:* Well, we were only young when we did it the first time and I got very drunk and --- well, to be honest, I can't remember much of it and . . . The truth is --- I bloody love you, Hermione Granger, and whatever time says --- *I'd like the opportunity to say so in front of lots of other people. Again. Sober.*
