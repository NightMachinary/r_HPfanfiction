That would be ideal, though statistics would imply that that's rarely the case. Life can often get in the way and force two people to take different, incompatible paths. On the other hand changing in order to be with someone isn't always what's best for you, and sometimes by the time the original change that created the rift between you and your loved one has set in, you have already fallen out of love and there's no point to it anymore--- I've a bit of personal experience on that one. It's a very case by case situation, really.
