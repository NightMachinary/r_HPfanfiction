Lmao did I say that you should include graphs and pie charts in fics? My only point here is that as much as as much as you want to call divorce and the other murkier aspects of romance "cynical", they are still a very real, mature part of romance and as such, it deserves consideration when imagining the mature lives of mature characters, as is this thread's purpose.
