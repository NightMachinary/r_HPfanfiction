  Mate i'm not the only one that points this out about you, it's every thread about Ron lately and your post history reflects that. It's not any criticism of Ron, it's you specifically (and two other users) that show up in every thread about him with this mad vendetta and tbh you ignore everything said to you and I just think it's fair that other people know not to waste their breath.

I don't ignore everything said to me, I tend to reply to most of it and argue my point of view on a book series, you're the one who aggressively goes after people the moment they criticise Ron at all as haters. I've actively said I don't think Ron's that bad a character, I like aspects of his character moments and arcs, I just tend to think that certain arcs/gimmicks were overused to create drama for little reason bar other character's story and he was underutilised as the series went on (which became more focused on Harry and Hermione to the detriment of many a character) and as a result I don't particularly like or dislike him as a result, he just sort of "exists" at times.

Simply because I disagree with your view of his interactions with Hermione or Hermione's characterisation towards them isn't sticking my head in the sand. Yes they have a deep friendship but I don't particularly agree it's really painted as more than that until HBP, which is the book that seemed to be where many of the most remembered romances suddenly took up a lot of the story (Fleur/Bill, Tonks/Remus going from one-sided to relationship, Harry/Ginny with the whole "lion" business, Ron Lavender then Hermione implied at the end of the book, the revelation Voldemort is nasty because of love potions and false love or something) and therefore to my mind comes across as something else tat Rowling didn't plan from the start but as she went along.

And replying to one person only to then go to someone else all to insult the former is the metaphorical going behind someone's back.
