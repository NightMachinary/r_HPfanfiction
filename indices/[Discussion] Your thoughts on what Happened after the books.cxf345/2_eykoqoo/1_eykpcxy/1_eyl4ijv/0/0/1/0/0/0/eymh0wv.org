She's friends with Ron and cares for him, much like she cares for Harry as well, but it's not until HBP where suddenly it's shown to be so deep.

Ron is shown to be jealous of the attention Hermione is receiving and wanting that attention in book four onwards, Neville and Luna are side characters for most of the series so, yeah why would it go into detail about them?

You see any criticism of Ron on here as proof that person hates the character and you're telling other users that I must hate him simply for criticising aspects of his characterisation.

Amazingly talking crap behind people's back doesn't make you out to be that nice a person...
