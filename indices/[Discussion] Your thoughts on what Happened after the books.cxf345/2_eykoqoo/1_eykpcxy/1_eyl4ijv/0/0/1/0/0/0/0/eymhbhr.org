  She's friends with Ron and cares for him, much like she cares for Harry as well, but it's not until HBP where suddenly it's shown to be so deep.

Yeah like I said, I doubt you'd be willing to look at any of their interactions in another light.

  Ron is shown to be jealous of the attention Hermione is receiving and wanting that attention in book four onwards

This is just ridiculous.

  You see any criticism of Ron on here as proof that person hates the character and you're telling other users that I must hate him simply for criticising aspects of his characterisation. Amazingly talking crap behind people's back doesn't make you out to be that nice a person...

Mate i'm not the only one that points this out about you, it's every thread about Ron lately and your post history reflects that. It's not any criticism of Ron, it's you specifically (and two other users) that show up in every thread about him with this mad vendetta and tbh you ignore everything said to you and I just think it's fair that other people know not to waste their breath.

Also I question how you think a public comment on a discussion board is talking about you behind your back.
