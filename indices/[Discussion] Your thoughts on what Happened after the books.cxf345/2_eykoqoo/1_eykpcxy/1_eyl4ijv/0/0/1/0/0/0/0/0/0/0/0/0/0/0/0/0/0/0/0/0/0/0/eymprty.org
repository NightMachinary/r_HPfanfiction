I've quite literally quoted several insults you sent me, which come in different replies, with your very first comment of this thread claiming something that wasn't true...

I shouldn't have to put up with personal insults on a discussion simply because you don't like my interpretation of a fictional character, nor should the onus just be "ignore it". You just shouldn't say it.
