  I'd like to be left in peace, that means you stop responding which each time comes with more and more insults.

None of this is true. I'm not insulting you. I don't need to stop responding, I'm not stalking you, and you're free to just not reply. Please refer to my other comments for the rest, I've stated everything already and you've ignored it.
