Nah mate I'm just telling you to move on. You're the one getting really triggered and personal about this. I deleted that comment because you said it upset you and that's polite, even apologised for it. I did explain why I wrote it. Maybe if you want to be left in peace you can just stop replying to me with this nonsense and move on with your life? It's a discussion board and I get notified every time you reply.

Again though there's basically no chance you're really reading any of this because you're still demanding I rewrite something I already wrote.

Let it go and move on with your life. It's a discussion board, nothing important.
