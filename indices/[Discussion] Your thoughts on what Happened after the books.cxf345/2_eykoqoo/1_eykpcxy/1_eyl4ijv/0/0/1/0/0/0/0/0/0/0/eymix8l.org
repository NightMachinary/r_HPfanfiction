I said you aggressively go after people, a well known term of expression, wading into threads to claim they're haters and that therefore other people should "not bother".

You couldn't actually highlight anything in particular I've done to warrant that other than just that I was present on a couple of threads where Ron was brought up /by someone else/ I then replied with my response to the arguments they were making.

If a person had brought up Astoria/Draco in a response about wizarding marriages we'd probably be discussing that but they didn't.

Stop putting words in my mouth and if you don't like me then maybe you can just move on rather than talking crap about me simply because I have a different interpretation of a character than you.
