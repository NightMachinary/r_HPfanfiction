You've been nothing but insulting this entire thread:

#+begin_quote
  " No one mentioned Hermione up to now lol."

  "Absolute nonsense. Krum alone disproves that."

  Also Hermione is clearly shown to be interested in Ron but I get the feeling you'll reject that.

  it's you specifically (and two other users) that show up in every thread about him with this mad vendetta

  I'll delete that other comment but it's difficult talking to someone that just replies "actually no it's not like that because I don't like it"
#+end_quote

You claim stuff happened, I refute it, and then you just conjure up something else with no reference to your previous claims. You dismiss anything I'll say before I even say it while accusing me of not listening to anyone. Even the admittance about the previous comment you deleted comes with this hackneyed backhanded justification for it.

And now it's all "triggered". For your comments about me your own conduct is rather petty at this point and, once again, you aren't able to provide anything of substance to justify it other than you don't like my interpretation of what a character would be like /after a series has ended/.

I'd like to be left in peace, that means you stop responding which each time comes with more and more insults.
