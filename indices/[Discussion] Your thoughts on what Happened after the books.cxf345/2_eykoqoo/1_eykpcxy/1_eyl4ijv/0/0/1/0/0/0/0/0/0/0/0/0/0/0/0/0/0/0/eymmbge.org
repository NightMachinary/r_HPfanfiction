You came into a thread, made an insult about me because you thought I was someone else, deleted that when I challenged you about it, and since then you've just been throwing weird shade at me for no reason.

All because I have a different interpretation of a novel than someone else, to whom I didn't insult or argue theirs must be rubbish or lies. Just that I didn't agree with it.

I'm still waiting for an explanation of why you did this and if you don't have one maybe you should stop talking to me and just leave me in peace?
