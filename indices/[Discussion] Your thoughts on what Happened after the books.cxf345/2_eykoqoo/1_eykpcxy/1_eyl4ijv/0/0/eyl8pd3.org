Except Hermione isn't from Wizarding Britain, much of her arc revolves around that entire issue of her having serious issues integrating with Wizarding customs and society (SPEW for example). She's always been of an activist/career-minded disposition while Ron is a bit immature and needy of attention.

Not doing the whole Harmony "she should've married Harry, because he's amazing" rant (until the sudden turn in Book six Hermione always came across as rather asexual to be fair) but to me they worked as friends who at the end of the day, after debating/arguing, had the benefit of separate bedrooms and the ability to go somewhere else if they had enough of sharing a space with that person. Completely different world when you have to see that person every day, share finances, and at the end of it share a bed.

Rowling and Watson have both at times stated any marriage would likely breakdown and require counselling, if not divorce, and from the books it's hard to disagree with that assessment.
