But will they? Because at times his flaws seemed to come back worse when he got too much attention. None of that deals with the fact much of the time he and Hermione are arguing to at least some degree with only Harry as their commonality, that they'd likely argue over Hermione pursuing her career while he sort of relaxes in post, he immediately fell for what's her name in HBP the moment he was paid attention to by women (which could lead to gossip in future putting strain on his relationship).

In my view there's just too many questions and issues that get in the way of "and then they were happily married with two kids 19 years later" when their issues take up a large page total of seven books.
