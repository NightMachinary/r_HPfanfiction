If you appreciate 'hurt-comfort' themed stories then you might like some of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2256653/Na-hiel][Na'hiel's fics]]. They've written a few m/m/m Harry focused stories, though the characters are usually heavily OOC. In particular, "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12050840/1/Feathers-and-Fireballs][Feathers and Fireballs]]" is probably closest to the harem idea though it's far from the usual relationship dynamic.
