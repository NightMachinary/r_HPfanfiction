True enough, but it can be interpreted as such because there is no balance, no counterweight. No quote and no action where either Dumbledore or one of his allies actually played for keeps. I'm not even talking about killing here, but a few broken or vanished bones would do wonders.

In fanfiction, anything can happen. In non-AU fanfiction, anything not disproved by canon can happen. Since there is not a trace of anyone on "Dumbledore's side" being proactive or effective before the Battle of Hogwarts (or at least nothing noteworthy enough to be remembered - I might have forgotten something) then deriving the no-kill rule is perfectly valid response given what IS shown.

Add in the emphasis and condemnation of murder by Dumbledore during horcrux discussion, and the no-kill conclusion seems almost reasonable. (Nvm that killing=/=murder). It's by no means THE ONE AND ONLY TRUTH, but it didn't come from nothing.
