Antony444 definitely has a very unique style. (Possibly they're not a native English speaker? I haven't asked.) It took me a few chapters to get used to it, but I can read it without thinking "that's odd". I've been reading their fic linkffn(The odds were never in my favour) lately, and I think the worldbuilding is really good.
