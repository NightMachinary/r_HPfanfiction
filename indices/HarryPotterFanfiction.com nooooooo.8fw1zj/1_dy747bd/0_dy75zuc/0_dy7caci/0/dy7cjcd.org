I have no idea, but in the last weeks leading up to the shutdown they removed the comment sections to prevent other archive sites from “advertising” and they removed the options to share and print stories to prevent readers from making pdf files of their favourite stories.

Maybe he was trying to prevent reposting by people who were not the author, I don't know. It strikes me as a scumbag move, though.
