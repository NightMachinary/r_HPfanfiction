Hoooo, boy. Especially if the author wants to, say, give Harry PTSD, or other behavioral issues, and they feel like they have to "justify" it --- by piling on the hot pokers and belt scars for angst!points. It comes across as entirely excessive and honestly (imo) a bit offensive. And it's so, so obvious when they're wholly /un/informed.

Early childhood abuse can manifest in so many ways --- aggression, impulsivity, dissociation, hypersexualisation, etc, along with behaviors that no one wants to talk about +like, how many fics feature fecal smearing? if we're going for realism points,+ --- and it's not okay to completely brush the very real signs/symptoms of that in favor of "shy-and-stuttering-Slytherin".

TLDR; Abuse! is not! just! an easy! plot device!
