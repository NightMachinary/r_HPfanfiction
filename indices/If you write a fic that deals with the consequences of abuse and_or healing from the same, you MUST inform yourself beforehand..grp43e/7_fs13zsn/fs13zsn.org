I would also add: you should think if abuse is even needed in your story. I've read so many fics that have a decent, well adjusted Harry and then just randomly throw in something like "oh, and then the Dursleys beat the shit out of him for three months straight", but then it never comes up outside of that. No revenge, no court cases, no screaming at Dumbledore. Just thrown in there because it can. In my opinion, that detracts from the story. And is also probably the most overused cliche in HP fanfic history.
