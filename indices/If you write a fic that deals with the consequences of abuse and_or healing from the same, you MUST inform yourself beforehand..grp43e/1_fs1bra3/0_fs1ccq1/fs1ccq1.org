I was thinking the exact same thing. It can't be any worse then when I have to watch someone use a computer on tv or in a movie. I think there is a line though. You have to make an attempt. For instance, NCIS doesn't even try. Their computer stuff is all bullshit to every degree possible. So there is a threshold, but usually even an attempt is good enough to pass my sensors for it.
