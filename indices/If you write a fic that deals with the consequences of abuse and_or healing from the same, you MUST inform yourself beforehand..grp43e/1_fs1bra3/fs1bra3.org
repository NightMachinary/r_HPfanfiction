Gee, I hate to be that guy, but I feel like your post is a lot like if I, as an educator, complained about how fanfic authors need to bone up on pedagogy before they write a classroom scene. As long as the appropriate trigger warnings are present, I say BRING ON the half-assed psych treatments. It isn't any worse than what JKR herself did to teachers.

That said, immersion-breaking is a problem in all forms of storytelling, with almost every major field of work. Ever talk to a programmer about "hacking" scenes in TV and movies? Yikes.

So, just as a matter of good writing in general, it's helpful to look up /anything/ instead of winging it. I probably spend /too much/ time with historic "magic" to drop half a reference for flavor. It's the least I can do to look up, say, the actual symptoms of a panic attack before describing someone's reaction as such. Thanks for the reminder!
