IMO with EVERYTHING out of the ordinary in any fanfiction. Don't write about disablities if you know nothing about them, abuse or anything, just do some research first. I think I read one that said that because harry was autistic he was some incredibly intelliegent savant who couldn't be manipulated, which isn't what autism is at all. It can kinda kill a fanfic with these sorts of things.
