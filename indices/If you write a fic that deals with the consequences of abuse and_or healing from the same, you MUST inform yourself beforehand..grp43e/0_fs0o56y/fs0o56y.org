I agree both with what OP is saying and with a lot of what I've seen in the comments so far, but also, being someone who's experienced first hand some of the types of abuse Harry suffered in canon and a lot of the common tropes in fics, I do sometimes enjoy reading just horribly inaccurate takes on these sorts of experiences and what comes after.

A lot of that, I think, has to do with wanting the content that comes with poorly written abuse angst fics (mentor snape, living with the weasleys, and other escapism fics are ones I particularly enjoy because, for me, reading fic is my own escape, and I like for that to be reflected in what I read.) I like poorly written abuse fics because, quite often, harry gets his happily ever after, and I get to read that amazing fluffy sweetness in whatever form it takes without being triggered, because if angst is written badly, it's not gonna give me angst. So I get to envision coming out of a horrible situation (or at least, someone else getting out of it) without having to relive a realistic horrible situation.

And if I'm in the mood for angst, not just the happy ever after recovery part, I can read really horrible scenarios and have a real grasp of how inaccurate they are, so again, it doesn't affect me too personally.

Well-written fic is always great to have around, and I love reading something and being utterly engrossed in it, coming out crying, and knowing that the author couldn't have done a better job than they did, but also. A round of applause for writers of bad fic, without whom some of us wouldn't be able to stomach getting to the tropes we really wanted, needed for our own form of escape.
