I love your comment. Thank you so much for writing it.

  One example of a work that contains sexual violence that is terrifying in its implication and actually very scant in the physical violence itself, is This Tangle of <snip>. This is a dark fic au, inspired by Lolita, with Tom riddle as hermiones step father. If you're only chasing violence for the yucky horror of it, it's much scarier when it's realistic.

That sounds terrible, but not in a qualitative sense. I recently watched PhilosophyTube's video essay on that book, and it just reaffirmed that I never want to read it. That sort of thing is for more inquisitive intellects than my own, honestly.

This entire topic actually touches on one thing I've noticed about fics which deal with real-world contemporary issues, like abuse or transitioning, which is that the fic does not really benefit from being set in this universe. For instance, a fic that has a trans!character will very often have them essentially take the routes present irl, with HRT and similar, instead of using the uniqueness of the setting to breathe some charm into the story.

For instance, I've never read a fic that dealt with a trans!character through a slow process of transfiguration, or with a psychologically-damaged!character through the canon (and fanon) mind magics. I think these would be great fics, honestly. The first would be an exploration of what it is like to be trans in the wizard world (ignoring that JKR is a filthy TERF), while not totally ignoring the setting or magic system, and the second would be an interesting explorative story about wandering and coming to terms with the damage to one's mind, but from a more active viewpoint.

The second story could be arranged episodically, with each therapy session being one chapter, and the story dealing with one specific thing through Legilimency - the therapist enters their mind, and they work their way through a representative mindscape, equating various "physical" things for mental traumas and treating them as they go along.
