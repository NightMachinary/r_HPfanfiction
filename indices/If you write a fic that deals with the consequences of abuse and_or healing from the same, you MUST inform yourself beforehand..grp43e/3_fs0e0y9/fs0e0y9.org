I do agree. As someone with formal training and personal experience with types of violence that I often see represented in fanfic, I find myself skipping chapters or quitting works altogether. A very obvious one is that people extravagantly overplay the physicality of violence without considering the psychological aspects which are actually far more terrifying, even to read about. The mental aspects are the scariest, and when I see fics like the Dursleys breaking Harry's arm and beating him within an inch of his life, I wonder if they realise that it's a bleak caricature that misses the worst parts completely.

If you wish to read dark fics with violence, realism is important in that it makes it darker and possibly also more meaningful to engage with themes critically. I recently wrote a scene where hermione survived an assault and has flashbacks in the shower. Fleur collects her, calms her down and pains her nails to distract her from the physical sensations she remembers. This is realism, dark, but also helps readers to be reminded of the reality that we as women face when we experience violence - and how we help one another and survive afterwards. We are people.

For children surviving abuse like Harry's, get online and read family law cases. Many cases are not as bad as the facts of his life, but still are devastating. If you want to write violence, look at the violence already available to us. One of the more upsetting cases I've had to read recently had very little physical violence. It involved a child being locked in a shed, not dissimilar to a cupboard. Also children of abuse in many fics are written to be meek. This is not realistic, typically. Look at care-experienced children, foster children, and our behavioural issues. We aren't a very meek lot.

One example of a work that contains sexual violence that is terrifying in its implication and actually very scant in the physical violence itself, is This Tangle of Thorns linkffn(12108523). This is a dark fic au, inspired by Lolita, with Tom riddle as hermiones step father. If you're only chasing violence for the yucky horror of it, it's much scarier when it's realistic.
