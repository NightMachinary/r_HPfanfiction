Agreed. Far too much I see people either under or overestimating, both by large margins, the consequences of mild/heavy abuse.

Don't want to deal with it? Either make the Dursley's just be assholes to Harry and him being a bit shy and with adult trust issues.

OR just imply some stuff and give him the basic package of flinching, trust issues, and low self-esteem, without describing everything and steering the story away from it ASAP.

THERE, no need to describe in detail beatings and psychological abuse, canon already has enough of it, and you won't need to read some depressing psych papers and theory to write a believable character study on how Harry is healed from his childhood by love and support or how it makes him into Tom Riddle 2.0 (now with the 10+ charisma and the ability to love).

I just prefer to gloss over it a bit or make Harry have slightly different experiences than canon(like having a crappy bedroom instead of a cupboard).

Maybe I make a bit more aggressive and impulsive so when he gets magic he actually severely retaliates instead of just taking it.
