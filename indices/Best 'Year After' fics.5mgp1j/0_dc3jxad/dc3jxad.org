This is right in my wheelhouse. I've read all of the following complete fics recently, and recommend them:

linkffn(Australia by MsBinns) linkffn(The Last Enemy by continuedinterests) linkffn(Faintest, Slimmest, Wildest Chance by Keeptheotherone) linkffn(The First Day by Little0bird) linkffn(Grave Days by Northumbrian)

I've also been enjoying linkffn(Keep Me Where the Light is by JKButcher), though it's just getting started.
