If you're into romance, linkffn(Saying Yes) and linkffn(A Bit Unhealthy) are both good.

I don't have many more "Year After" fics, but I do have "next-gen" fics (Harry's kids and Teddy's generation) if you're interested.

EDIT: It's the wrong "saying Yes". [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9336215/1/Saying-Yes][I meant this fic]].
