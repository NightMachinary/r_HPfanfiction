Interesting, found a few I hadn't heard of before that sound interesting, so thanks for sharing!

Just a minor note: In your description of Strangers at Drakeshaugh, you use the phrase "deep-seeded". I believe it's actually "deep-seated" - I can't find an origin for the phrase that sources agree on, but most of them agree that it's seated, not seeded. Hope I didn't come across like an ass with this!
