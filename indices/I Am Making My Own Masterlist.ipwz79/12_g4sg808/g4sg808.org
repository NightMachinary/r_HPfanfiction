Nice compilation!

If you have been reading or plan to continue reading a lot more in this fandom, I would strongly suggest adding more to your notes and descriptions to help you if you're looking for one of these again. Using Delenda Est as an example, I imagine if you read 30+ stories with this pairing, some of the details may blend together and it might be hard to figure out which is which later.

For example, my masterlist has a column for Sortings that differ from canon, to help keep track of the ones with Ravenclaw!Harry, the Golden Trio all in Slytherin, Gryffindor!Draco, etc. There's a column for which years the fic takes place (e.g., 1-3rd year, 7th year-2 years post war, 1945, etc.), a column animagus transformations, patronuses, and who lives/dies that's different from canon. It may seem silly to put in so much detail, but after 500+ fics listed in the last 3 years, plus many more forgotten before I started keeping track, it's really helpful when wanting to compare details or give a recommendation.
