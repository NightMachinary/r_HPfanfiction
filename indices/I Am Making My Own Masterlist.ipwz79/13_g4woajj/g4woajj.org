I like your summaries, and I am going to read(or re-read) some of what you recommended)

I would just like to point out, that according to Author notes, the "canon" epilogue of Letters is in Chapter 21 and is very much Harry/Fleur, it's the Alternate Epilogue that's +bullshit+ not "canon". Still one of my favorite stories.
