My list:

Seventh Horcrux by Emerald Ashes- It's basically Voldemort took over Harry's body when the events of Halloween happened, and is now pursuing his true goal: trying to become a Hogwarts professor. Absolutely hilarious, and brilliantly written.

Potter Who and the Wossname's Thingummy by ForrestUUID Technically a crossover with Doctor Who, but not much so. Very well written, quite worthwhile. Keeps you thinking.

Oh God Not Again by Sarah1281 Hilarious take on the time travel do over tripe. Very original, well-written, highly recommend.
