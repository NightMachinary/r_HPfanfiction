I'll check out what you posted, but I think you are missing out if you have never read Blood Magic by Gateway Girl.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/719610]]

I read you don't care for slash, so I'll tell you upfront that Blood Magic has some Snape/Lupin, but it is not the main plot of the story. Main plot is that it is Severitus and Harry and Snape struggle to build a relationship.

Another set of fics that has been around for ages and that deserves more recognition IMO would be Angie Astravic's work.
