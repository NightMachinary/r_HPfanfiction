I highly recommend Birds of a Feather by Babylonsheep. Its a time piece of Tom Riddle in his Hogwarts years, but if Hermonie was born in that time period with him instead, it's very interesting and very well written characterization and very good at bringing you into the 1940s mindset. It's not complete yet though, and hasn't gotten a new chapter in a bit idk if author intends to complete it and just taking a break or if its abandoned still great
