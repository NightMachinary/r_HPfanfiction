While you and rpeh make several valid points, it seems that you're neglecting the reason why this story gets the following it does. It's because HP fanfic is so inundated with Lord Potter of Hogwarts BS while doing nothing with all the possibilities it offers.

Yes there's no conflict, but imo that makes sense since this is set in post-war. It's meant to be a slice of life story that doesn't focus that much on magic because that arc is considered to be over based on the setting. If I wanted magic, there are tons of fics that cater to that. Whilst the story is set in a magical world, people seem to forget that even wizards & witches have jobs. While some occupations are lucky that they deal with magic on a day to day basis, there are also a lot won't be able to do so. Apart from magic, all problems of the mundane world is mirrored. This story is a breath of fresh air to the community of HP fanfic full of OP Harry, Lord Potter of Potter, Black, Slytherin, Gryffindor, etc., sex fics, and the like.

Also, it's not fair to harp on the grammar of this story to the point of labelling it as "dreadful", whereas HP fanfiction contains a fuckton of stories that seems have not been proofread but still has a large following.
