  Also, it's not fair to harp on the grammar of this story to the point of labelling it as "dreadful", whereas HP fanfiction contains a fuckton of stories that seems have not been proofread but still has a large following.

Less bad is still bad. Just because other people do it worse does not mean it's good or should be praised.

  Whilst the story is set in a magical world, people seem to forget that even wizards & witches have jobs. While some occupations are lucky that they deal with magic on a day to day basis, there are also a lot won't be able to do so. Apart from magic, all problems of the mundane world is mirrored

You're lecturing a guy who's written multiple fics that deal with exactly that and manage to do it with plot and characters that are more than just a list of names on paper.

Novocaine is plotless and dull. Arguing that it 'doesn't need conflict' because it's post war just points out how pointless the whole thing is. Conflict doesn't need to be people hexing each other. There's no difficulty in it, nothing feels earned, none of the characters develop at all, and, as [[/u/rpeh]] says nothing happens. It's the same thing over and over and over and over. Some conversations are repeated verbatim. Everything goes exactly the way Harry wants it to.

Novocaine is only popular because of the pairing. And because it updated frequently enough at the start to get everyone salivating about it. It does almost every technical aspect of actual story writing poorly and will continue ad infinitum until he gets bored because there's not plot. I'm also not sure how it can possibly be a breath of fresh air because what you cite it avoids...is literally the first chapters that boils down to 'who has what political seat even though it doesn't matter because Harry is the Hegemon.'
