You're making it sound like I don't criticise other stories. Definitely not true. Inter alia, I've criticised - and been criticised for criticising - Seventh Horcrux, which I consider to be one joke spread thinly over 100,000 words; A Black Comedy, which is *no* jokes spread over 250,000 words; and several other popular stories. I also praise stories quite often. It's how I started working with [[/u/TE7]] for instance.

On the grammar issue specifically, I've stopped reading plenty of stories because of poor grammar alone. On the other hand, once or twice, I've been gripped by the plot enough to offer to help out. In fact I did it just the other evening on a Discord channel, where a writer with English as a second language was... having trouble.

Other witches and wizards do have jobs. We see quite a few of them in canon and we see that, magic or not, a lot of jobs are still utterly tedious. In fact if you had to come up with one single theme for the seven canon books, it would be "Not even magic would be a panacea". But even when Rowling is writing about dull magical jobs, they're still magical. Self-inking quills, flying memos, rain in an office, and the like. If you're taking the magic out of a Harry Potter story, why not go the whole way and take Harry Potter out too?

If you want to see well-done slice-of-life stories, there's a good set by [[/u/FloreatCastellum]] at linkao3([[https://www.archiveofourown.org/series/1344409]]). Or try TE7's own linkffn(Vitam Paramus).
