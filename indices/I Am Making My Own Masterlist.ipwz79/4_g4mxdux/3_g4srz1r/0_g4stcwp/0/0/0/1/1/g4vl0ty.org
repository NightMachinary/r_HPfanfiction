Well it seems that you're a person of good taste, just with damn high standards lmao. It's a wonder you can find stories to read. As a plebeian in reading and writing, I yield to your well-reasoned out points.

This is just out of curiosity and totally not meant to seem like "oh yeah, well can you do it better?" kind of question, but if you were say, a beta reader for the story, what would you suggest to make it better? Not the author of this story btw, just legitimately curious.
