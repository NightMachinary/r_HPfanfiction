Well, those tropes that I cited are terrible simply because most of the time that this setting is used, only one thing is focused on. One fic I recall has the lordship trope, where Harry inherits Black, Potter, Slytherin by conquest/or his mom (somehow), and Gryffindor. Now nothing is wrong with using tropes, but if you're going to use it, at least do something with it. This story continues on where his titles are simply used as foil to make Harry even MORE ostentatious.

Have you ever played a game where you maxed out your level, finished all your missions/quests and there's simply nothing left to do? Well this story feels exactly like that to me, except there is the purpose of rebuilding/improving the infrastructure of the wizard world as well as giving more opportunities to muggles, since that's also a common trope where muggles are marginalized in the magical world. That's why this feels like a breath of fresh air.
