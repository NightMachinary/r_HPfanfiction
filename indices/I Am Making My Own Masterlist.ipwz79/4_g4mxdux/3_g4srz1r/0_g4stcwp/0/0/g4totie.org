I didn't get as far as [[/u/rpeh]] but to tack on to it all, no one ever responds in way that feels authentic. There's never a scene of Harry offering to help someone and getting a response of, "Eh, thanks, but no thanks, I'll figure it out." There are people that, you know, like to accomplish things themselves. Everyone falls right into line.

You can jumble around half the names in the story and nothing changes.

The opening politics drags for all eternity and can be boiled down to nothing more than a list of names Harry now controls because plot reasons. And those reasons require a lot of suspension of disbelief for what is otherwise presented as a modern society. And, as of like twenty chapters later, or at least what felt like that long, it hadn't had any bearing on the story after it was discussed. Which make me wonder why we bothered spending so much time setting it up.

The Ginny subplot falls flat on its face as the only real conflict between the two boils down to Ginny would rather be her own person than Harry's trophy girlfriend. Harry starts throwing money at everyone in an attempt to become a political hegemon for....reasons...and never even talks about it with her and then we're supposed to be surprised when she has little interest in it. Breaking up over that is the most authentic thing in the story, except that it's done in such a robotic, almost transnational manner that it seems almost comical.

There's a lot of sentence structure issues and comma splices and the like, rpeh even points one out above while harping on a different issue. That alone becomes distracting.

I'm shocked it's got the following it does. It seemed very flavor of the month when it first started getting recommended. And I'm also almost positive I'm to blame for the Daphne/Lawyer troupe but...ugh. At least one or two of my readers picked up that Harry was using her when he'd fuck her.
