Really? Okay then.

There's no conflict. The story can be summed up as "Harry fixes the world by flinging huge amounts of cash at everything". Every problem that comes up is dealt with this way within moments of the issue being identified. Every other chapter seems to have a former classmate with a problem coming up to Harry, who hires them, throws cash at the problem and then moves on.

The writing is, at times, laughably bad. In the very first chapter we get the incredible line

  "This was my father's business," said Daphne. "Unfortunately, he was murdered by Death Eaters two months ago."

...because everyone would describe their father's murder as unfortunate after two months, right?

Don't try to claim that Harry and Ginny splitting up is conflict either. The author is set on a Harry/Daphne pairing so simply moves the totally undefined Ginny out of the way and brings in the totally undefined Daphne instead. There's no romance, no wooing, no actual love: the switch has all the love interest of a set of Ikea instructions. Remove girlfriend A and insert girlfriend B. Jane Austen must be gutted she didn't manage anything so glorious.

I read a recent update to see why one or two people still think this is a readable story and it started with a healer having a headache, then a long discussion about renovating a hotel, and Fleur walking around an apothecary. There was zero plot movement, zero magic and zero interest. Oh - I see it's still the latest chapter. What else?

  While the GSC team finalised the details of Prisma, across the country at the James Potter Institute, the Cornfoot brothers had a meeting with the Institute's lawyer, Pearl Proctor-Langley.

That's seriously a line in a story about magic? I've seen episodes of The Apprentice that have more to do with magic.

I've previously described Novocaine as "A story about accountancy set in the Wizarding World" and that's basically it. The whole story is full of boring characters doing boring things. If you're an accountant wanting to read about accountancy then you might get something out of it. Everyone else should steer well clear.
