Dude, this isn't print. This is a completely different media, so you can do different things with it. You don't have to read it in one sitting (though I do have to say that I read Atlas Shrugged in one sitting, and NO ONE outside of Russian literature drags things on as long as Rand did). There are multiple ways you could keep track of where you are. You could download it as an epub or pdf and use a reader that can keep track, bookmark whichever chapter you're on, leave the tab open, a word document or notebook note, and so on.

Also, for something like ASOIAF, they'd probably do multiple omnibus collections for the series, like two or three books each. See the omnibus collections for The Belgariad and The Mallorean.
