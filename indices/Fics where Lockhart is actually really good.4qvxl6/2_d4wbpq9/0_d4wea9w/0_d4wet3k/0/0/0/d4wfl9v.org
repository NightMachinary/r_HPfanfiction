They can't omnibus ASOIAF, because like I said it already begins to push the limit of what can be printed. Heck, quite a few countries have had to /divide/ books like ASoS for publication in other countries.

Knowing when and how to split up a story is also part of being a good writer. It may be a different class from original works, but this is one place where fanfiction shows its lack of editing. At the least this writer seems to have delineated their story.
