I think I've actually figured out what exactly unsettles me with single fics that are that long. They tend to run into structural problems, with everything building to one far-off climax and the author neglecting to keep up the regular, normal book length payoffs. It was an issue with ASOIAF too; the last two books were actually planned out as one and they kind of suffered for it (plus we haven't actually gotten a payoff yet).

Plus I don't trust the author's ability to keep pumping out to the 1.5 or even 2 million mark, so I usually don't pick this sort of fic up until it's complete. I'm not saying it's definitely the case with this author, just that it puts me on guard.

Do you know what chapter the first year stops at? I want to give the story a try anyway.
