I want to say 35, but he has the breakdown in the author's note at the end of the first chapter. Second year is done too, and third year is being written and will start being posted on Sep 1st.

I do want to say that first year isn't great, but that's because his purpose is to subvert the usual WBWL and Slytherin!Harry tropes, and first year is when he establishes the tropes in order to do so.

EDIT: 1st year ends chapter 34.
