So, I'm reading it again, because why the fuck not? and I was reading the authors notes because, again, why the fuck not? and the author discussed splitting the series. Apparently he had put it up to a poll, and the majority outcome was have it as one long fic, but there was still a good number for splitting it up. So he's going to do years 1-4 as one file, and 5-7 as another.
