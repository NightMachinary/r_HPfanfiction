A lot of the novels of the 19th century were published serially. Dumas wrote like that. Though I don't agree with the idea that reader input will lead to crappy fanfiction - sometimes, a review will raise a point or question that fits in very well, and in the electronic age, editing and rewriting past chapters is far easier than in the 19th century.
