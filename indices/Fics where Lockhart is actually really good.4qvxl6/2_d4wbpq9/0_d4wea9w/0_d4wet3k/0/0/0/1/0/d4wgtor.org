I did the same, but regretted it. Accidentally advance the story progression bar at the bottom? Good fucking luck getting back to the page you were previously on in a timely matter. The tiniest of bar advancement is hundreds of pages. Then you are left just swiping individually for like 50+ pages to recover.
