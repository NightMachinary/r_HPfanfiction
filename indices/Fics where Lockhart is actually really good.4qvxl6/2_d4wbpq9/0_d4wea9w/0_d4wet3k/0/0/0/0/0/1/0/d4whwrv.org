I'd be happy because 1.5 million words in seven fics is a hint of story structure, planning and editing. One /can/ do the structure, planning and editing and put it out in one fic, but you'd damn well better give me a properly formatted epub with a well laid-out table of contents, like an actual omnibus.

And that's another thing, I'm not committing my time to a single fic of that scale unless it's complete. With multiple fics I can just grab the complete ones and move on.
