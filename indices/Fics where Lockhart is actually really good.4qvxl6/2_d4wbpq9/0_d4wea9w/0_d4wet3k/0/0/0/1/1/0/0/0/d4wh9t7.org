Oh, definitely. In some ways it reminds me the most of pulp fiction magazines from the 20s-40s, where stories would be printed chapter by chapter in sequential (or at least chronological) order by issue.

A particular example is actually older than that, with Dickens' Great Expectations (which I hate). That was published serially, and Dickens would alter the plot based on how the readers reacted or wrote in, leading to an incredibly twisted and meandering tale. This is very similar to those crappy fanfictions where the author puts up polls for what should happen to the story.
