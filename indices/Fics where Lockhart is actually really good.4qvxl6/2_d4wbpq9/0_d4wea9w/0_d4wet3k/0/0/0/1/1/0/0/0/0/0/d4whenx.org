I agree with you on the matter of good reviews being useful. I'm particularly thinking of the type of fic where the author doesn't have a plan for the plot, and keeps asking the readers to decide where the story goes. That's what I've got the issue with.

And I didn't actually know that about the 19th century stories. Makes sense though, now that I think of it. I only knew of Great Expectations because that fact came up when we read it back freshman year of HS.
