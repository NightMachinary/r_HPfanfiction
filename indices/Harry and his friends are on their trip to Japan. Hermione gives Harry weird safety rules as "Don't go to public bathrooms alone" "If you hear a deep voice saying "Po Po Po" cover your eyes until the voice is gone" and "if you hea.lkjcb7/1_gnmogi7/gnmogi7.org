Plot Twist: because of the unusual side-effects of his dying and then returning through one of the most obscure, convoluted loopholes believed possible (and the energies of the Stone, not the others Hallows), Harry has a relatively uneventful trip.

Why? Because to supernatural entities, he scares the shit out of them: from their perspective, it's like seeing something that's paradoxically alive but dead walking around mixed in with a bit of Lovecraftian Elder horror.

Harry blinked at Hermione, who had frozen stiff. "Why did that woman just shove her head in that toilet?"

"...It's fine, Harry. Everything's fine."

He frowned: that had become her new mantra this trip. Every time they saw a stranger acting... well, /strange/, she'd repeat it over and over while trying not to hysterically laugh.

It was even weirder when that nice lady with the scarred cheek took one look into his eyes and then threw herself off the balcony -- when he looked over, he presumed she'd disapparated or took a portkey or something, as there were no signs of her.

Japan really was a strange place.
