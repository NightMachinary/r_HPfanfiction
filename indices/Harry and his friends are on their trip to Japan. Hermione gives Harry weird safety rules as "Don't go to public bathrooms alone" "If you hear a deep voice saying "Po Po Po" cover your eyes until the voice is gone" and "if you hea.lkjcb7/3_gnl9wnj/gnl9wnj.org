Another story that scared me straight as a kid (why was that website named scarystories4kids, it SHOULD NOT be for kids) was the Japanese lady with a medical mask one.

“If you see a Japanese lady with a medical mask over a scarred mouth and she asks “do I look pretty?” you have to give a neutral answer. If you say “yes” then she gives you a matching smile, if you say “no” then she kills you for disrespect.”

I never figured out what a neutral answer could be.
