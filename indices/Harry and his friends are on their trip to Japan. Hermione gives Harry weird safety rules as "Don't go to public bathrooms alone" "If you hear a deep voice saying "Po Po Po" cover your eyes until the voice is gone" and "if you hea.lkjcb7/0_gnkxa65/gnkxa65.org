The only reason I know of these urban legends are because of the Scared to Death podcast by Dan Cummings. He researches topics like a bored Ravenclaw and tells them on his podcasts(Time Suck being his main), the Scared to Death podcast is my favorite of his. You should listen to it.

The story of The Woman with the Long Neck (po po po) is terrifying. Follows a boy who saw her, and what the grandparents had to do to keep him safe from her that same night while trying to escape her and the village, kid was barred from ever going back to that town and even was a bit haunted years later. It's a good story, very scary, so I don't want to spoil it, but damn it's a good listen.

Dan has told some of these other japanese urban legends too. I would totally read a harry potter story in japan where he encounters one of these scary beings.
