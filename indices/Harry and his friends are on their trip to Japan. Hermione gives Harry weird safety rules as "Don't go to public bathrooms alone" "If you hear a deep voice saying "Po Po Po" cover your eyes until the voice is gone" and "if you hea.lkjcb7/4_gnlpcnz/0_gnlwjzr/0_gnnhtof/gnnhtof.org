Or the Head of the group heard that /the/ Harry Potter, Vanquisher of Dark Wizards came to Japan and ordered a preemptive strike. Harry is just like "I just wanted to go on vacation! I had no intention to fight anymore dark wizards!" and then he does it anyway, because that's how he is.

Edit: In general, Dark Wizards reactions to Harry being either frightened panic or /I'll prove myself better by besting you!/ is pretty hilarious to me.
