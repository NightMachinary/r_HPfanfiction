Nah. Buying American cars wasn't done back then and tbh it still isn't really. We drive on opposite sides of the road so it's not the safest thing in the world for a start, unless you can afford to have it reworked to be right hand drive, and in all honesty American cars don't have the best rep over here, unless you're a collector.
