Yeah that absolutely wouldn't have been a "normal" car on the roads of Southern England in the 80s and 90s- it would have stuck out like a sore thumb.

People just didn't have American cars here back then. For his regular car he'd have had a top of the range Rover. No way is he anything but a Rover guy- middle class and British. And if he wanted an expensive "weekend car"- a classic Jaguar. Still middle class and British, but not affordable to the majority and the epitome of luxury.

If he was going to go for something really really flash, like OP says if James bought him something super expensive to build bridges, then an Aston Martin. DB5 or 6. James Bonds car.
