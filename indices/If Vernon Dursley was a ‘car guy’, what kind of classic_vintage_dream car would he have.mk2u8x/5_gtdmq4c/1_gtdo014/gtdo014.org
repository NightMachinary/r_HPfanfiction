See, my idea is that the car is/was a gift from James Potter, kind of a “I'm sorry I was a jackass” peace offering combined with a wedding gift. I had read that Rowling says James embarrassed Vernon during a double date/meeting and the car was a way to make amends.

I'm viewing James as someone who has thinks that words alone aren't enough to properly apologize, and he intended to hand the car over in person but the whole Voldemort thing forced them into hiding.
