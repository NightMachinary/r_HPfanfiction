For nice, tory-voting Surrey businessman, Vernon Dursley, he's not going to drive a Dodge Challenger. It'd be an american ‘yob car' and thats even if he's heard of it. American Cars (except Ford) only really came to the UK in the past decade and the only time I've seen an ‘muscle car' here was when I was on D of E in the Arrochar Alps because they were filming the introductory advert for the Mustang (c.2015) which had just been imported.

We can estimate Vernon's net worth roughly. A four bed house in Surrey at today's prices goes for between £500k - £1 million depending on the type. So we can roughly say he probably drives a new-ish mercedes, Jaguar, Bentley Continental or maybe a Rolls Royce Corniche. He appears to have a lot of money to throw around, but I can't decide if he's new money or old money (Yes, Class dictates the type of car you drive). I'd bet on the former, which means he's more likely to have flashier cars and visible wealth.
