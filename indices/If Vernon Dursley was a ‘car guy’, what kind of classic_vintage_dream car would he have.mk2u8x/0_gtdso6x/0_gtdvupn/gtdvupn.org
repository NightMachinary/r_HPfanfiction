Except the Dursleys would have bought their house in or before 1981, when the average house price was around £24k (so say 30 in the London commuter belt) and the average wage was around £8k- so let's say Vernon earned 10 or 11 as a junior management person. Three times your wage was the average mortgage loan back then, so he will have comfortably been able to afford Number 4, yes, but that doesn't sound like "a lot of money to throw around." Surrey and even London were affordable to the middle classes up until the 90s. Even ten years on, at the start of the series, the Dursleys are comfortable but not "rich." Vernon has a higher wage as he's now quite senior, but the cost of living has gone up.

The Dursleys are, I wouldn't even say "new money." New money indicates lottery win or got lucky with setting up your own business. Richard Branson is new money. Alan Sugar is new money. The Dursleys aren't "monied." Vernon still has to work- even though his income is clearly high enough to have a comfortable standard of living on one wage. They're middle-middle class- Vernon clearly comes from a better off background than Petunia (and Aunt Marge with her tweed, brandy, and dogs seems somewhat upper-middle)- him being a public school almunus and wanting his son to go to the same institution screams upper-middle; but the obsession with "normality", the constant car washing/polishing, the perfect lawn, the overly fussy decor and matching suite and all that says more middle-middle, or even aspirational lower-middle mindset.

So, that said, I'd agree with you the best car for OPs idea is a Jag. A Merc would be something Vernon would want, but also it wouldn't stand out. For someone of Vernon's class status and social attitudes, especially at the time, a sporty Jag would be the one- it's luxury but it's not gauche, it's British, and everyone knows the value of it. It shows you have more disposable income than the average but it isn't in-your-face. The neighbours would be jealous, but they'd also find nothing to criticise.
