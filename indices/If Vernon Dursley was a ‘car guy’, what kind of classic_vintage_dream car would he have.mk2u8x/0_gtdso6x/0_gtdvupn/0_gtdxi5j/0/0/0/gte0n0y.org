True, "the director" would imply that he's the boss. But then there are other types of directors especially in a big company- you can be the financial director or the sales director or the director of HR (not that I can see Vernon in HR, he is very much not a people person!) Plus even if he is the head honcho, being CEO isn't synonymous with owning the company, if it's not a family business CEO/director is still very much a salaried position and you're answerable to the owners and or shareholders.

I feel like he's worked his way up to Director from starting as like Sales Manager or something, but it's very much not his company. He's the boss but not the owner, idk why but something about the Dursleys lifestyle makes me think he's still beholden to /someone/ in his working life.
