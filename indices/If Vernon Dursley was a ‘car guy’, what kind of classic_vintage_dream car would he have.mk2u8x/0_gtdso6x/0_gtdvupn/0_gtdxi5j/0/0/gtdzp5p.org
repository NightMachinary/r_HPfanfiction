Hmmm in PS, it's stated as ‘Mr Dursley was the Director of a firm called Grunnings which sold drills' Now unless I've had a very strange experience, through school and such but whenever I've someone be referred to as The Director it has almost always meant the Head of the Company and/or the owner, at least up here where I live. In the Scots translation, he is referred to as the ‘Heid-bummer', which translates as the Head or Boss.

It could also be likely that Vernon's parents may still be alive and holding most of the family money but this is entirely suppositional.
