At the time IIRC a lot of companies gave their employees cars as a benefit to get around income taxes.

For a big executive car, maybe the Ford Granada? Alternatively, a Ford Sierra Sapphire RS Cosworth for a fairly hot mid-size family car? These were both Ford UK cars, Ford Sierra was very well selling and the Cosworth had high performance and racing pedigree, and probably wouldn't have been too expensive?
