linkffn(13352687) This story actually features a Gryffindor Harry and will cover all seven years, which is something I've never seen before. In this story, he is actually driven and his introduction to the magical world comes in a very different way than in canon. This mixed with a more intense environment at Privet Drive changes his character quite a bit, and there is no golden trio in this fic. It's about to enter year 2 and will start uploading weekly every Sunday starting this one at least until the end of year 2.

linkffn(13507192) I know this story is super short currently, but it will also cover all seven years and features a Slytherin Harry who is more realistically effected by his home life, but not some dark lord in training either. This fic is a bit more heavy on the AU side. It will follow certain elements of canon, but Halloween, and more importantly, the events leading up to it in 1981 went very differently than they did in canon. This story updates every Saturday. Fair warning, it is a WBWL story and does contain a Female Voldemort, so if that's a turn off for you, there is that.
