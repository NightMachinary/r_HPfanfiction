Come on! Hinny IS the canonical pairing, so there is no need to have disclaimer for few weirdos who really passionately dislike what JKR designed. I am not saying that it is wrong to be Harmonian or another weird animal of such kind, but to have disclaimers against Hinny seems like too much. Besides, the blurb of it from the bot has Characters: Harry P., Ginny W., so it is kind of obvious.
