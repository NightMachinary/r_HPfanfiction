To be honest it doesn't bother me at all. But there are some people that seem to absolutely loathe any Harry/ Ginny stories. Which is really weird to me since they are characters from a book and not real people. I was quite shocked when I started to read fanfiction and discovered the absolute hatred some people have for Ginny and Ron. I mean I understand not liking certain characters, but hate? That seems a bit like going overboard. They might be a minority, but it's a pretty vocal minority. The amount of fics bashing Rin and Ginny is staggering.
