Given that I believe most authors (and readers) of fanfiction stories are teenagers (or close to it), I have [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/review-of-escape-and-mr-and-mrs-percy-weasley.html][my theory]] that this is mostly a teenage reversal of authorities. Everything good is suspected to be bad and vice-versa. Hence, so many “Light is not so light” (aka Dumbledore-bashing) stories, or good Death Eater stories (Dramione, Drarry). And thus the official pairing is rejected as wrong out of bat.
