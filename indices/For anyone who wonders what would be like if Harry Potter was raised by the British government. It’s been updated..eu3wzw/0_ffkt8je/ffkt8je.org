In the completed [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6652537/1/Quoth-the-Raven-Nevermore][Quoth The Raven Nevermore]], Harry gets raised by one of the Beef-eaters of the Tower of London, monitored and aided by several government agencies.

The name comes about because Harry is a natural Animagus with the form of a Raven, but the story as a whole is heavy on traditional mysticism and lesser-known folklore. Those who have never heard of the three-fold goddess Morrigan will be rather lost in several of the scenes.

Warning, it is a Harmony fic.
