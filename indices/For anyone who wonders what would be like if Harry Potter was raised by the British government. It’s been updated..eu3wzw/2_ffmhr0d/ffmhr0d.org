You know what, I love you a bit and I hate you a bit.

I love you a bit because I did not know this fic up until now. So thanks for that.

And I hate you a bit, because I know a story that has the exact same orogin (Vernon dead of heart attack, Harry raised as a "Royal Ward" - thats also the title) and that hasn´t been updated in a while, so I read your post, got really happy (because my dumb brain thought an new chapter of Royal Ward was up), then got really sad because it wasn´t.

​

But now I am happy because I have a new fic to read. So thanks for that!

​

Edit: "Royal Ward" was / is based on "Hatal Fart Attack" by Corwalch
