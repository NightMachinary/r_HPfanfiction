Seriously now I'm just imagining Mrs. Weasley send Harry a howler about the Triwizard tournament and it scream about him not putting himself in Unnecessary danger by volunteering for lethal tournament and Hermione or Ginny getting to angry Add Molly for doing that and how it affected harry and One of them sending Molly Weasley a howler back that absolutely rips her apart for assuming She knew all the circumstances of the situation based on the newspaper Instead of writing and actually asking Harry What happened Like any concern Edson actually would before screaming at them.

I'm picturing Molly Weasley getting chewed out in the middle of Diagon alley by a Howler in Hermione's voice. And Molly actually learning a lesson from it
