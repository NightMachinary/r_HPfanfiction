At what point could you frost a mirror enough that it would be considered non-reflective enough to /not/ count when it comes to reflecting the basilisk's glare?

Because technically all matte materials - like the Hogwarts castle walls - are reflective. Diffuse, but still reflective - that's why they're visible. Most students in the castle were probably subject to the Basilisk's glare at some point.

Side note: could you get petrified if you're blind?

Could the basilisk petrify itself by looking in a mirror?
