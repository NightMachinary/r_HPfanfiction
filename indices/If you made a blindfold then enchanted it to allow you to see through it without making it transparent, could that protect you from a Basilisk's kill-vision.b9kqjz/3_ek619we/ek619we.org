You would still be petrified. The sight of the eyes causes petrification, at least in every instance of the books. Also, its likely that the spell would be overloaded, if the vision properties are anything like its venom properties. A support of that is it destroys that one boys film out of his camera.

In every instance of a character seeing some form of the eyes, they are petrified. We know it has to be the eyes because Harry could watch its shadow without harm and Fawks took out the eyes.

So, that means an enchanted blindfold that allows you to see through it, would still petrify you. At that point, it is a glorified mirror around a corner or seeing through something like a camera or a ghost.
