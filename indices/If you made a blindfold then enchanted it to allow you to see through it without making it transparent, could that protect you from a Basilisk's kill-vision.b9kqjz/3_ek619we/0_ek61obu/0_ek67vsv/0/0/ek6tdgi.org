Well where does inanimate to inanimate transfiguration fall? Are the aware of things like the basilisk, the coming war, etc. Is the SI muggleborn or a mondo in the body of a pureblood child?

How are you approaching Harry Potters ridiculous soft magic system? Are the power cores and levels or is it a matter of will, intent, and emotion?

Enchanting is pretty high level and the purposed blindfold would need to hold the magic and be capable of surviving the murder haze of a creature stepped in magic with one goal/intent.
