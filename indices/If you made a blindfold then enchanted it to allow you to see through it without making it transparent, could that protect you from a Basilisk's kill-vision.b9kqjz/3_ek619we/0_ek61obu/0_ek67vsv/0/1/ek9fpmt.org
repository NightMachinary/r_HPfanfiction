Your solution is simple then. Dont go down there like that. An intelligent driven magic user would not face a Basilisk alone without a 100% sure fire way to kill it before it killed you. Its possible even a transfigured rooster wouldnt work as the magic would know that its not real.

The solution to forcing the situation though could be to use the curse krum used on the dragon at its eyes by knowing general snake biology. You could levitate boulders above its head, dropping them, as snakes have been rendered blind IRL like that, and if you do it that way, you could argue that it cant see you therefore it cant kill you with its gaze.

To kill it though, id go with its own venom route. No snake is immune to its own venom (exempt for certain species) and i dont think a Basilisk is immune. When it goes to bite, blast a fang off center, get out of the way. Done. It just stabbed itself with its own fangs and killed itself.

Basically study snakes, and figure out how to do that blind before hunting down a giant snake that kills you by looking.
