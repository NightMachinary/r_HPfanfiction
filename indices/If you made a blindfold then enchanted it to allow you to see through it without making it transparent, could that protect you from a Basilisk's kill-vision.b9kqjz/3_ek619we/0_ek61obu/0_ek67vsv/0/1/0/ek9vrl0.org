I'm not willingly facing the Basilisk, I'm getting stunned in the back by a possessed Ginny and waking up in the Chamber with Riddle getting ready to do his big monologue.

The specifics of how I intend to kill the snake involves transfiguring a sufficiently large rock into a spear, then banishing it into the beast's mouth when it's open. I figure that only the scaly parts of it are highly resistant to damage, and the roof of it's mouth should be vulnerable enough for a heavy, pointy rock launched at speed to pierce it.
