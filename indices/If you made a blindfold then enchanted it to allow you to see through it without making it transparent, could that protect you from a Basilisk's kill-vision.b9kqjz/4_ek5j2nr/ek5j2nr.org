I feel like it requires mutual eye contact. You have to meet its eye with your own. Two way mirror, enchanted blindfold, things like that? I'd say you're fine- you know, except for the fact that you're standing in front of a basilisk.

The more interesting thing to me is the question of glasses. There is a glass barrier between your eyes and its own. Same basic concept as Colin's camera and the Hermione's mirror. Is there a minimum prescription that would change it from Kill to Petrify? Or is there something more to it?
