I think that it might differ between the books and movies. True, the movie shows the red flash, but I think that's only because it is un-cinematic to not show a flash of something. I'm sticking to my guns that it is never mentioned in the books what color crucio is, so it is technically fanon. Thank you for providing the link to this though, it is a fascinating video!
