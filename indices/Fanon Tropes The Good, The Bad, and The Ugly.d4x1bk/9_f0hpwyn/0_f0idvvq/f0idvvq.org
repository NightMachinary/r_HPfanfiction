Eh, the Imperious is shown a few times in the movies, and it's almost entirely different every time. When fake Moody uses it, it's clear and invisible, and the person is completely normal, another time the victim is almost rabid and their eyes glaze over, and it's even shown as a sort of mist that the victim breathes in, which makes them look extremely high.

Imho it depends on the caster - a skilled wizard is able to do it covertly and the victim behaves in exactly the same manner as before, except they follow the command, less skillful castings completely disable the victim's higher brain functions and turn them into little more than a trained animal, and less skillful, but also less malevolent, castings make the victim high enough that they don't care about much of anything.
