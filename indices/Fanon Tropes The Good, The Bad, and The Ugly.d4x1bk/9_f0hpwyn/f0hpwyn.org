" , or that /Crucio/ is red (it's actually clear, lol) " actually, in the movies, the Cruciatus IS red, it's the IMPERIUS that is clear, but on topic....i don't care for the "ron the death eater" trope where he is as bad as Malfoy or worse, yeah i don't particularly care for ron but that's just taking it too far IMHO
