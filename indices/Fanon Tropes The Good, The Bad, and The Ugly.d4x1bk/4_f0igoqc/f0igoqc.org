I feel like most tropes are ... neutral. They can be done in a good or bad way.

That being said, let's see... I would say that some that lend themselves to /generally/ being in bad fics include: Soul bonds, marriage contracts, light lords, hyper manipulative/dumb dumbledore, Lord Potter, and the super friendly goblins b/c harry asked them something nicely. All of these /can/ be done in a good way, I feel - but I've found that most of the fics I've seen with them tend to make me run away fast. Oh, and add hyper manipulative 10 years olds talking in stilted 'political' terms ;)

I like the fanon tropes with Daphne/the other slytherins, because they're fun to have in there (and them all being evil would be no fun). I actually kinda like the concept of 'magical cores', or something to that effect to show what we kind of intuitively get from the books - that there's some amount of magical power innate to different people, it's not just an on/off switch. That's a bit of a cop out though, because it'd technically fall in the above category - but I like more explained/explored magic systems, though I don't like those that put firm numbers on it or treat it as an excuse to just make Harry insanely powerful.

A more fleshed out world in general is also a lot of fun to explore - though I wouldn't call most of the fanon tropes there /amazing/ in my book :)
