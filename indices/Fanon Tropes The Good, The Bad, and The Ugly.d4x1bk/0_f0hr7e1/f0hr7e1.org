Good: fleshed out other houses and schools (even though it can really be all or nothing sometimes) and a good and /consistent/ magic system.

Bad: black/white morality. Also "we're the good guys so we don't fight, we just serve as target practice for our ennemies to kill and torture).

Ugly/Bizarre: these fic where they change a few letters in a name and they do it consistently, like Hagwarts instead of Hogwarts.
