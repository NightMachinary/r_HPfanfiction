Ugh I know. I'm writing a Draco time travel fic and was struggling with all of that. I generally prefer gen stories because I think there are more interesting themes out there to be explored than romance, but...

my cursed child Draco, who has lost the love of his life to a blood curse, is suddenly back at Hogwarts with his wife, 13, alive. I can't just not address it. But at that age, kuds aren't even interested. I'm a teacher and my students have their first “relationships” with 12/13 and that's one day relationships that usually don't even get to holding hands before they are over. At first I had Draco not worry much about it because he assumes they'll eventually get together just like they originally did.

But one year into the story they are best friends and the Yule ball's just around the corner and suddenly the whole thing is a problem again because he only has three options: be the only one not having a date, asking someone else who he doesn't have feelings for on a date, asking his super young wife out on a date. Option 1 and 2 also risk that his wife goes to the ball with someone else. He struggles with this a lot. But then he discusses it with a friend and his friend says

“are you sure though about the whole age thing? I mean you are 14 in everything but knowledge and experience. [...] I don't think a real grown up would have such an easy time being friends with so many kids. We should bore you to tears with our petty little problems, really, but we don't. I never feel like I'm talking to an adult when I'm talking to you. Grown ups also don't eat like they're a human trash can. They aren't as moody and prone to temper tantrums. They don't get into prank wars with other students [...] and they certainly don't use their time throwing paper planes at other students during lessons.”

And the conclusion that Draco (and I) came to was that it's not just the mind that decides your age. It's the body and hormones as well. Hormones are what make teenagers moody, hyperactive, eat a lot, grow,... so I don't think it's too much of a stretch to assume that if you are in the body of a kid and are effected by a kid's hormones which make you think thay Quidditch is more exciting than girls, then that makes you a kid. I mean, if taking hormones can turn a man into a woman, I assume they can also turn a man into a child...

For me that solved that problem. But I had to think a lot about what defines age and so on. Draco then asks her out on a date and they kiss and then their relationship isn't the focus of the story anymore. I assume it will be relevant again soon when she figures out he's a time traveler and has to come to terms about it in her own way.
