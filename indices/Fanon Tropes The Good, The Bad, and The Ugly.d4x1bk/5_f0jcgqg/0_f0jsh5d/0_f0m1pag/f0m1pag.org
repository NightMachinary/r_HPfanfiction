I would love to see this done well. Like how the hell do you navigate this insane mish-mash of feelings?

Presuming the MC isn't a pedophile, there's not going to be any romantic oomph to those feelings, since your hindbrain is gonna clearly tell you that this child is, well, a /child/. But the love, the affection, the emotional intimacy are all going to be there and be so /so/ powerful.

And how do you navigate the fact that this other person will quite literally never catch up with you? Even if you could avoid nasty-ass grooming behavior, when that person is 13-ish, they're gonna wanna start making out with other 13 year olds, and the time traveler is, presumably, going to be a sought-after target.

So lets say you tamp down on that and can deal with the trauma of watching the partner you've exclusively loved for decades fumbling around with other people. Then you get a bit older, and now here you are at 16 or 17 or whatever and you finally think you can begin something like an adult relationship with your beloved, only to be struck with the horrible realization that over the past seven years, your love has only grown into a teenager (still basically a child) while you've grown from a, let's say, 35 year old into a 42 year old.

More than that, you're an adult who's gone through a strange, traumatic, surreal experience, thereby growing even more as an adult. You've matured into comfortable middle-age while the target of your love is still a (blegh) high school /kid/.

What do you do? Wait another five years? Now you've moved further into middle age and finally, finally, your beloved is an adult, although very much a /young/ adult. But at this point, if you've tried to do the ethical thing and stay hands-off, your love has almost certainly moved to someone else. Maybe even married, given the Rowling-verses ludicrously young marriage ages.

In the end, I think this story done well ends up becoming this heartbreaking Love in the Time of Cholera type plot, except without the "happy" ending of the main characters ever getting together.
