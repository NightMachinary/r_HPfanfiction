Excellent list, that I heartily appreciate! Especially that training isn't an instantaneous thing- took me months just to be able to run any decent distance, and for Harry to go from one lap to fifty in the course of a week is absurd. Also, your point on the weird relationships that are often portrayed, between kids and de-aged adults, or between teacher/students, or even worse, between mortal enemies, is spot on!
