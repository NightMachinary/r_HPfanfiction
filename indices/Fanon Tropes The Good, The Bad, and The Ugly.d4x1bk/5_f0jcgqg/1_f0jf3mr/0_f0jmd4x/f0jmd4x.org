I don't mind imbalanced pairings in smutty oneshots, where they serve to scratch someone's itch.

But in more plot-focused things it's icky to have a relationship between people who clearly don't have the same amount of power.

There's a reason why student/teacher and employee/boss relationships between consenting adults are forbidden or at least strongly discouraged. Having a teenager involved just makes it so so much worse.
