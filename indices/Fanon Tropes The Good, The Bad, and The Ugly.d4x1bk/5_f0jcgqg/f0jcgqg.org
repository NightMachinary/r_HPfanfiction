Like:

- additional world building, the world is a big part of the appeal the books hold for me
- Lily having done something that actually defeated Voldemort on Halloween
- Snape or Malfoy getting an redemption arc (assuming it's done at least somewhat well)
- good do-over fics
- getting good evolves a lot of effort
- creature fics that are well written and don't involve mating or soulbonds (I'm assuming this exists)

Dislike:

- Snape is super-attractive
- Harry is the first person ever to remember a goblin's name
- Ron is only friends with Harry because he wants to use Harry's fame/money
- either everyone is gay or everyone is straight and everyone is paired up at the end
- teenagers swearing undying love as an important plot point
- Dumbledore is obsessed with Lemon Drops (Shebert Lemons are mentioned /twice/ in the entire series, once in the first chapter and once as a password for his office)
- Luna is obsessed with pudding (she expresses her hope for pudding, i.e. dessert, being served at a feast /once/)
- training for a summer results in teenagers being at magic than almost everyone else
- blatant americanisms

Hate:

- Voldemort is actually the good guy/right about blood purity
- heavily imbalanced relationships, especially student/teacher
- Harry is abused to the point of near-death by the Dursley
- do-over fics where the mentally 30+ main character grooms their eleven year old love interest
- being forced together by a soulbond or marriage law as the basis for a happy-ever-after relationship
- eleven year olds spinning political intrigues
- complete character transplants where at most a cartoonishly exaggerated trait remains of the canon character
