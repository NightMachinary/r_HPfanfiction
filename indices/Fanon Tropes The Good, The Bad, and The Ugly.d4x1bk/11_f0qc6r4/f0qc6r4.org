Honestly, this sub applies the word "trope" so broadly that it's more or less completely lost its original meaning, so for the purposes of this thread, I'm gonna take it to mean "recurring elements in fanfics, no matter how minor or broad." Dunno if that's what you meant, but I made my best guess.

The Good:

I genuinely can't think of a single thing that always piques my interest in an HP fic; I'm truly drawing a blank here. I guess meaningful content, but even by the crazy broad definition I'm using here, I'm not sure if that counts. I seriously can't remember the last time I found a fic and enjoyed it on more than a surface level.

God, that's depressing.

The Bad:

I'll admit, this is tricky for me, since most story elements/premises that are the obvious picks for this section are things that, at least in theory, I quite like, but which are "developed" and presented with the subtlety, grace, and compositional skills of a wild turkey. Which, if you've never seen a wild turkey is . . . [looks at notes] none. That said, I've got a fair few things that I really wish would just die:

- Teacher/students pairings that are meant to be seen as romantic rather than creepy and abusive
- "Supremacist/anyone whom said supremacist believes to be subhuman due to their birth" pairings full stop
- The Death Eaters are really the good guys: no they aren't, they are racists. Stop trying to rationalise racism.
- Evil Dumbledore with no point (a story in which an authority figure is the main antagonist has a lot of potential if it actually bothers to do anything with that dynamic)
- "Movie characterisations are what the lord intended!"
- Dan and Emma Granger. Rupert bothers me slightly less, but only slightly.
- Bellatrix was brainwashed into becoming a death eater; forgive her, readers: she knows not what she does
- "Dark lord" being a "dark wizard who amasses a following" rather than a title Voldemort gave himself because he's obsessed with making himself seem impressive
- "Master of death" being taken literally, especially if owning all three Hallows somehow makes a person invincible or outright immortal
- "Realistic" takes on the HPverse, since they're usually just the author copiously handwaving away any perceived breaks from reality. For instance, saying that Harry's reaction to the Dursleys' abuse was unrealistic and making up a magical explanation for said reaction rather than changing it to something more extreme.
- Speaking of: cartoonishly abusive Dursleys
- Evil Weasleys
- "Malfoy was right all along!" Nope, he really wasn't.
- Malfoy hates Hermione because of who she is as a person; it's nothing to do with her birth status
- 11 year olds are somehow competent politicians. Most actual politicians aren't competent politicians. That said, a fic where all the Slytherin kids /think/ that they're brilliant politicians in the making while all of their parents are fully aware that it's basically just a game they're playing could be a lot of fun.
- Characters with no self-awareness whom the author clearly isn't portraying the way they think they are. For instance, a Harry that's meant to be badass, but is really just an inept whiner who constantly fails upwards.
- The MC is the author's stand in who exists to tell all the characters who are wrong™ about how they're wrong™, whereupon they immediately change their ways to be right™

The Ugly:

I'm choosing to break this down into two sections: one for theoretically interesting ones that are overused and always bad, and just plain /weird/ shit.

- Indy!Harry
- James and/Lily survived to raise Harry
- Harems or polyships: I feel like I need to justify this, so check out [[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JhSyKaXczGI][this video]] for context on why I'm interested in the former (specifically the more general parts of the video, not so much the ones about QQ in particular), and as for the latter, so long as it's an actual exploration of how a polyamorous relationship can work and not just "Harry gets two girlfriends because he deserves them and women are trophies," I'm down
- Harry has a sibling
- Uncommon Harry ships
- Fred and George have very similar but ultimately distinct personalities
- Harry can tell the twins apart

And now, the weird shit. Hoo boy.

- werewolves can smell everything, including abstract concepts (this also belongs in the "please die" category)
- A/B/O. Nuff said. (This does, too, incidentally)
- Voldemort/Dumbledore saying stuff like "thee" and "thou"
- Snape has a kid
- Voldemort has a kid (inb4 anyone gets any ideas, I will never accept CC as canon)
- Dumbledore has a kid
- Snape and James were fucking
- Snape is Harry's biological father
- Long-"distance" time travel
