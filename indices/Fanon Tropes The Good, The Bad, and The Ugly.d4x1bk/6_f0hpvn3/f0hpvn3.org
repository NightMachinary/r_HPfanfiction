I both love and hate Helpful!Goblins... It can be a fun thing but also annoying as hell depending on how it's done.

Lords aka Lord Hadrian Potter-Black + four other titles just because... Both some of my favourite fics have Lordships in them and some of my most loathed...

Hate the Death Eaters are the good guys trope... Hate it

Love bashing fics that are well written but also love Harry's friends being ride-and-die levels of loyal

Love Harry fucks off and gets his own life fics, love them so much, especially other schools or xovers

Love a good Snape is Harry's dad

Hate Harry/Snape, Harry/Voldemort (I will make exceptions for Harry/Tom), hate most Harry/Draco

Love a good slash fic

Love abusive Dursleys so long as it doesn't stoop to rape
