Oh I like that. Just a tiny cute little nod to the name "Hermione" that's also bland enough to go unnoticed if you're not paying close attention.

That strikes me as a perfect way to use a reference in a work, as opposed to the hamfisted bullshit most fanfics have of just full-on quoting Princess Bride or something. Make it subtle, specific, and not the kind of thing that's going to jar you out of the flow of reading.
