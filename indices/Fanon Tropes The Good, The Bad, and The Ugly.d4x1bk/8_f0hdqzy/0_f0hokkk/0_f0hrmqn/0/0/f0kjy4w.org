I agree, but also I think Dan and Emma are common enough names that they also qualify for being subtle enough. I didn't even get the reference until I saw people bring it up in pet peeve threads. I didn't really like the movies and don't think about them as much as most people though. (My mental Harry and Hermione don't look much like Dan and Emma)
