Honestly, for me, it's the reverse. Sure, Dan and Emma originate in a really nauseating streak of Harmony wank, but they're named that in so many fics that for better or worse, I've come to perceive them as their actual names, and when an author names them something else, it's jarring. Of course, Hermione's parents aren't generally prominent enough that naming them something different is enough to hugely impact my enjoyment, but I notice. Similarly, we thought James' parents were Charlus and Dorea for so long that I can't endorse Fleamont and Euphemia. It just feels wrong.
