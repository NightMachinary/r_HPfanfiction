So? Perhaps the house where all the bigots end up in is truly a shithole. Canonically, almost all Death Eaters we know of came from there and not one of them ever called Malfoy out on his behaviour, which means that no one was bothered by his calls for racial purges or behaviour towards Hagrid and Buckbeak.

I'd much rather read a developed Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff than a fic trying to come up with ways to have "good" Slytherins.
