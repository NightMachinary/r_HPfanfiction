Again, they had no issues with Malfoys behaviour. No one wanted to fight against the evil mass murderer who was carrying out a systematic campaign of racial purges. Not one ever asked to fight for Harry and/or Dumbledore. The two Slytherins on their side were Andromeda Tonks, kicked out of her family for her life choices, and Slughorn, who couldn't go back to Voldemort after spilling the beans about the Horcruxes. Not one student from Harry's age group. That tells me everything I need to know about Slytherin.
