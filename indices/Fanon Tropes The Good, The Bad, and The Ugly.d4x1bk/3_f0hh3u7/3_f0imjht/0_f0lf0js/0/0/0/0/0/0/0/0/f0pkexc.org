I was being facetious. What I meant is: it's a perfectly reasonable supposition that any Slytherins who stayed to fight would have kept quiet about it. Three canonically did exactly that (plus at least one underaged Gryffindor), and while I'm not gonna pretend that they weren't Death Eaters (well, I don't think Crabbe and Goyle technically /were/, but they were very much in Voldemort's camp and it's not a meaningful distinction), it makes perfect sense that more Slytherins would have done the same, with roughly even odds of fighting for either side.

Edit: which, to be clear, is /not/ evidence that there were Slytherins fighting for Hogwarts in the final battle. Given how Rowling wrote the canon members, and has written about the house as a whole during and after publication, I'm close to four-million percent certain that she didn't intend for there to be. I'm just saying that if you want to headcanon that the Slytherins we don't get to know are decent people, there's nothing stopping you. I mean, you specifically don't seem to want that, which is equally fine, of course, but, y'know, people in general.
