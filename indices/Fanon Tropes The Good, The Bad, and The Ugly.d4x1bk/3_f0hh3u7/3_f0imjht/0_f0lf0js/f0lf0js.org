We know Crabbe and Goyle are dumb Slytherins. We know Bulstrode and Parkinson are ugly Slytherins. And we know Malfoy and Parkinson are bratty Slytherins. But we can still guess that most of Slytherin *isn't* dumb, ugly and bratty, because that's seriously unrealistic. 25% of children are not evil.

So I think it's neat that fanon has collectively decided that Daphne is good-looking, Theo is smart, Blaise is charismatic, Tracey is a half-blood. Those contrasts are needed, otherwise Slytherin becomes a lot more boring, and stories set in Slytherin become much harder to write.
