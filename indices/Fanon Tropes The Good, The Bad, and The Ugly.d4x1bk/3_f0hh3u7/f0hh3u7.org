ITT: Pet peeves

Anyway, I think fanon gets a bit of a bad rap. Sure, it's mostly shit, but it's still better than /Cursed Child/ right?

*The Good*

I really like fanon Slytherin. Yes, Daphne Greengrass, Theo Nott, Blaise Zabini and Gemma Farley are basically fanon inventions... but I'm /glad/ that they exist. Because otherwise you're stuck with morons and brats: Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, Bulstrode and Pansy.

*The Bad*

Light magic / light wizards. I think it feels weird and video gamey, and clashes badly with the morality and magic systems in HP. Also, writers don't have a good grasp on what 'light magic' may constitute, apart from the Patronus Charm.

'Magical Cores' is a more common pet peeve around here. I think that's another example of 'video-game fanon' that clashes with and mundanises canon.

*The Ugly*

Marriage contracts and soul bonds. I'll admit to pre-judging here, since I've read very few of these fics. (If anyone has good fics that do these, I would be interested in recs.) But it seems like lazy and fluffy plotting to me. Also, while soul bonds could /plausibly/ be compatible with canon, life debts and marriage contracts ... do not.
