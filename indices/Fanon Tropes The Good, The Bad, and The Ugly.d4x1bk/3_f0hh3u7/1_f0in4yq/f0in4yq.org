Whoops, that one went right over my head. I think I saw the word Peeves and just skipped right over it. Thanks for the solid response though! I'm going to go check that thread out as well.

Edit: damn, there's like, 5 currently ongoing threads about this, they just all use the word peeves. I'm kind of embarrassed...
