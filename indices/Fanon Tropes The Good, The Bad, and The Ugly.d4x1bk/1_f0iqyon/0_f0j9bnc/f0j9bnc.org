/Every/ muggleborn laughing at /every/ muggle reference while the purebloods stand around dumbfoudned. You telling me they've /all/ read/watched LoTR in 1991? Just once I'd like someone to make a reference and look expectantly at Hermione who responds "Huh I don't get it. Oh Doctor Who? Yea I've seen it but I was like 5 years old at the time. He wore celery or something right? I don't remember him having a scarf" or "Star trek? Is that the movie with the laser swords?"
