Most of all, everyone having read Lotr at 11. It's not exactly the most read book amongst pre-teen (moreso in the 80s/90s). Narnia or Enid Blyton books, those could be expected, maybe the Hobbit; having muggleborns to think the sun will petrify trolls, or re-naming Fluffy as Timmy, or even asking about pizza-eating magical turtles, is much more plausible than quot(h)ing The Raven and the ring inscription (in Black speech). We're talking about eleven years old who then live 3/4th of the time in a culture where those works are probably unknown, not about angsty and/or nerdy teenagers going with english litterature for their A level....
