*The Good*\\
- Non-canon pairings. I like a well-written non-canon pairing, though I tend to avoid Harmony, most Drarry, and Snape/anyone.\\
- Different genres! The Harry Potter universe is possibly only surpassed by the Star Wars universe for how well different genres can fit into it. Romance (of course), mystery/whodunnit, crime thriller, supernatural, coming of age, war, horror, dystopian, legend, historical fiction, legend, etc. I would love to see a Western HP story that contains the elements of a Western but is set in modern-day UK.\\
- Wizard politics. While most commonly done over-the-top and unrealistically, wizard politics can be fascinating and I enjoy quite a few fics that contain lots of wizarding political drama. Though I will say most fics with politically savvy children are a bit much, though there are some notable exceptions.\\
- Non-Harry POV. I like reading stories from most other perspectives.\\
- Crossovers. I've read a handful of good crossovers (and dozens of bad ones), and my favorites are Mass Effect and Star Wars, and I'm still looking for a really good HP/Pokemon crossover.\\
- Unique ideas, including fun oneshots.\\
- Quidditch. I love Quidditch in stories. I wish there were more Quidditch-oriented stories, especially ones featuring Oliver Wood and/or the Gryffindor Chasers.\\
- Competent professors. I like it when the professors actually do their jobs and inflict punishments and rewards in ways that make sense.\\
- PTSD Harry. Not angst-Harry, because PTSD and angst are /not/ the same thing. But I enjoy reading about a Harry that comes out of the war with scars that are a struggle for him to heal, and require help from his friends. It's why I find Auror Harry to be rather uninteresting.

*The Bad*\\
- A lack of editing. There are so many fics that would be greatly improved with basic spellchecking and grammar checking, and with a quick read-through or a beta reader. - Naming Hermione's parents "Dan" and "Emma"\\
- Moldyshorts/Umbitch/Dumbles/other shit nickname\\
- "pup" "cub" or anything of the like. I recently had to break a habit of flipping off whatever device I was reading the fic on every time I encountered pseudo-pack language.\\
- Extensive pop culture references.\\
- Seer Luna. Please, no. She's /odd/, not /genre savvy/. And her oddness is just plain fun. Please don't ruin it by making her quirks have a purpose. Same with Dumbledore. Let him be eccentric for the sake of being eccentric, dammit!\\
- Glaring Americanisms.

*The Ugly*\\
- Agenda fics, in which the author has a clear agenda (political, racial, character-bashing, etc) that they hammer home with all the subtlety of Hagrid appearing on peoples' eleventh birthdays. Sadly, a lot of shipping fics can fall under this because many contain copious amounts of bashing.\\
- Smut that contains nonsensical harems, A/B/O dynamics, extensive noncon, etc. I have not yet found a good harem story despite having no problems with the idea.\\
- WBWL. This is only placed in the "ugly" category because, like harem fics, I have not found a good WBWL fic. I have read some decent stories in which Harry has siblings and/or the Potters are still alive, but it seems the entirety of WBWL fics are mediocre at best, and that's if you're being generous.\\
- Fanon Hermione in general. I love canon Hermione so much but fanon Hermione is typically unbearable. And it's sad, because I've never had nearly as much difficulty writing a canon-compliant Hermione as I have Luna or Sirius. I am not sure why so many people struggle with her character.\\
- Magical cores. While not a bad idea in theory, it's most frequently implemented to explain why Harry and/or Hermione have Merlin-levels of power.
