linkffn(My Lord Harry Potter by Mugglebeene) and linkffn(Harry Potter and the Peverell Legacy by tartan-slippers) are the two I could remember the names of, and very different, but I've read other good attempts too.

The old Teacher's Lounge forum on FFN had challenges for reading and writing what got called LBPB (Lord-Baron Potter-Black) fics and quite a few were well written and funny.
