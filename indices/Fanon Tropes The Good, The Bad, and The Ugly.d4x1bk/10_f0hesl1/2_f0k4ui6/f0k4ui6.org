Huh, I think that I might actually have a slightly more than token disagreement with you on the good.

- The wizarding aristocracy is pretty much always done horribly and pretty much always copies real-life Britain. It has no basis in the plot.

In exchange I do like it when an adult takes Harry under his wing to learn politics. Harry is a huge celebrity, and fics that have a helpful mentor Dumbledore that isn't just a boring wise wizard are great.
