To a certain extent I'd say that all fanon is bad, in that it shows laziness on the part of the author and tribalism on the part of the fandom. There's a certain amount of /wink wink nudge nudge/ about these tropes, like the author and the readers are loudly repeating private jokes to show off the fact that they have a common history together.

However, the more "general" a trope is, the more forgivable I find it. The best tropes aren't so much specific story elements as much as they are themes.

*The "Good"*

- Harry gains access to the wizarding elite/aristocracy and learns their ways. Frequently done very badly (see below) but can be executed well (see: Out of the Night).

- Harry becoming more proactive.

- Harry's latent magical talent (e.g. Patronus, ability to resist Imperius, overcoming Voldemort in priori incantatem) being properly developed.

- Development of the mind arts. Again, is frequently done very badly.

- Exploration of new locations within Hogwarts.

*The Bad*

- Lord Potter-Black.

- Helpful goblins.

- Magical cores/expendable magic.

- Magic being explained with physics/being likened to energy.

- Magical theory being mathematical in nature.

- Muggle weapons/military tactics used to solve magical conflict.

- Mindscapes.

- Fragile Harry i.e. a Harry who is in some sense emotionally damaged by the Dursleys/his experiences.

- /Everything else/ (Snape as Draco's godfather, Dan and Emma Granger, trust vault, etc.)
