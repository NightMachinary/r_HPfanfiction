I wish I could remember the name but I'll describe it and maybe someone here knows it. Basically Hermione figures it out and she and her parents help him get away and live with them then she and harry start a support group for abused students with mcg and snape as faculty advisers. Ends up with them making friends with a couple slytherins and a few other students like Neville and luna. Also has harry/Katie bell(I think) and hermione/fred/krum.
