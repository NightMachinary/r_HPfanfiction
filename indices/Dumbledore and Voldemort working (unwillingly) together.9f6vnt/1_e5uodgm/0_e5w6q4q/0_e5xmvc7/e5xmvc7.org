I read some of the first book and it really seemed not my style. I'm always a fan of political fics, but this one didn't have any hints towards any action. The prowess mentioned seemed to indicate a reason to have little conflict. I'm sure it could easily have good action later, but I prefer the learning magic and Hogwarts setting. A great story, but it's not my style.
