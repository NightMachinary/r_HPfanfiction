Tom, as a student before he even discovers the chamber, becomes a target of assassination by Harry who has travelled through time to kill him. So he has no choice but to stick with Dumbledore even if he doesn't trust the professor.

I really liked that the story was from Tom's POV, I can't say more without spoiling the fun but it was interesting to read a young and inexperienced Tom Riddle that actually does make him seem like he's a student that's stuck in a situation that's out of his league. Not to mention how Tom's and Dumbledore's portrayal was some of the best I've read.
