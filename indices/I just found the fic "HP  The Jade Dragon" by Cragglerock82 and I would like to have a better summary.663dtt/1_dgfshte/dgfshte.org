It's a harem story, but one with slow progress though.

The fiction is reserved for people who want something entirely 'new'. 90% of the fic takes place outside of Britain, and a large majority of the characters are rather bland OC's.

All in all, I was intrigued by it at the start, but found the story rather dull and at times just plain boring. I basically skim through the new chapters, but the story utterly failed to drag me in.
