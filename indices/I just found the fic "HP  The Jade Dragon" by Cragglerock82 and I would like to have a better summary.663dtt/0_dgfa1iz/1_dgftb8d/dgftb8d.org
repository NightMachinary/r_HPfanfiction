  Master Kuzuko was delighted to find that Harry and Hermione were both very quick studies and by the end of the lesson they had been able to cast the 'Plaga' spell which acted and had wand movements like striking someone with a sword, 'Pugilo', which they already had cast during the power ranking test. She also showed them 'Dutus Plaga', which was mace strike and while powerful wasn't as hard hitting as a hammerstrike but still powerful and the final spell she taught them was something called 'Katano', which she explained was like hitting someone with a samurai sword as it was powerful but more importantly with enough power behind it was capable to slicing through their opponent's shield.
