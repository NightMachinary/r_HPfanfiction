Hermoine. I've run across this a few times already where it wasn't just a typo, the author used this spelling every time. I can see why people would think it was Ginevra or even Delores, as both names aren't mentioned all that much. But for characters like Hermione, who gets mentioned very often, I'd expect fan fiction authors to know how to spell her name.
