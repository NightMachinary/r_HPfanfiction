Yeah. I have a few scripts I can paste in the chrome-console to fix stuff like this. Here are my most used ones:

Remove crossovers in any listing (for examples communities)

#+begin_example
  $(".z-list").filter((a, b) => $(b).text().indexOf('Crossover - ') !== -1).map((a, b) => $(b).remove());
#+end_example

Replace a word

#+begin_example
  var searchFor = "MacGonagle", replaceWith = "McGonagall";
  $(".storytext p").find(":not(iframe)").addBack().contents().filter((i, e) => e.nodeType == 3).map((a, b) => { b.textContent = b.textContent.replace(new RegExp(searchFor, 'g'), replaceWith) });
#+end_example

Just open the developer console with F12, go to the console-tab and paste it there. Of course, to replace a word make sure to actually replace MacGonagle and McGonagall with the right stuff.

Usually the fics aren't worth dealing with it, but I had a good one, and just couldn't bear it after a few minutes. Note that this only works on ffn

I also have one to deal with annoying separators that I can dig out if you want.
