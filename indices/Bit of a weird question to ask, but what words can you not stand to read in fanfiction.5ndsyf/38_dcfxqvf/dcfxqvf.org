"One", as in "one Harry James Potter" (the middle name thing, also annoying) or "one Hermione Granger". When used properly, it's pretentious enough - but people keep misusing it, or even worse, adding "the" in front of "one", which is just wrong. Just use the characters' names like a good narrator and stop trying to sparkle.

Also, not a big fan of "Griphook". Unless its being lampooned fucking MASTERFULLY, the whole "I remembered a goblin's name and now we're BFFs" thing that that name heralds makes me want to stab.

Other irritants have already been mentioned, but I'd like to make special note of (1) uncreative adjective use ("greasy" Snape, "smirking" Draco, etc.) and (2) the dumbass nicknames, like calling Snape "Snivellus" (or worse, "Snivellous"... where'd you get that "o"?), and childish variations on Voldemort. It's not brash, cheeky, funny, or even confrontational... honestly, I'd get more of a laugh seeing Harry call someone a cunt... picture it...

/"Potter, detention! Just like your father!" Snivelliousity Snape spat, his greasy hair dripping greasy sweat down his greasy hooked nose./

/His fierce jade eyes glowing with untold power, one Harry James Potter, Heir of Myrrdin, met the greasy black eyes of his perpetual tormentor, and cocked his messy-haired dome to one side, "Snape," he sighed defeatedly, "why do you have to be SUCH a cunt?"/
