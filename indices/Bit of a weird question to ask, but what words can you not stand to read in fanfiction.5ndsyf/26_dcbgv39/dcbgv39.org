Trail/trial annoys me. So does whilst and similar words. Especially when an 11 year old is saying it. I can /maybe/ buy Hermione saying it but not many other kids.

Also words that should be contractions but aren't because the author refuses to acknowledge that contractions are an accepted and proper use of the English language. Like saying can not and not can't. Once in a while is fine but when your entire fic has no contractions at all it sounds stuffy and stilted to me.
