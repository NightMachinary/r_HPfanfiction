  Anime sources often have a distinct aesthetic, and set of signifiers that are, literally, foreign to English-language media. In comedy anime, for example, a large sweat drop may appear on a character to signify not that they are sweating, but that they are uncomfortable or embarrassed. Anime fans are proficient in reading these symbols, but this may be a barrier to understanding for those new to the medium.
