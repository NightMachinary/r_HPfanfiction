It's mostly just (what I assume are) british sayings/customs that can gnaw at me sometimes. These may be canon, or may be little0bird-isms because I've read their work so much.

"Merlin's holey Y-fronts" - this needs to go and never be said again.

saying "mo" instead of moment

"Father Christmas"

"Happy Christmas"

"Beatific(ly)"

Also just the weird usage of please throughout the books, I can't give you an exact quote because that would take some effort, but what I can remember is something to the effect of Hermione being called on and and beginning her question with "Please Sir/Miss/Professor......." but she wasn't requesting anything.

And the last thing would be the prevalence of sleeping in night gounds. Like as far as I know according to my personal experience night gounds are specifically reserved for people over the age of 60 and insane asylum patients.
