It's not really a word, or even a specific phrase. But whenever someone horribly overestimates the amount of time an action scene would take place in it hurts my soul. It does NOT take 30 seconds to a minute to cast two spells and kick someone. The next time I see that I'm going to genuinely have a tantrum... A very manly tantrum... with a machinegun, and a cigar.
