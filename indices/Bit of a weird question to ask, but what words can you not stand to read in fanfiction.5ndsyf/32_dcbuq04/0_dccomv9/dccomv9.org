I remember reading a series that had a good plot but the dueling was a big feature and was terrible.

Character A: "Five second incantation"

Character B: Waits patiently for spell to hit. Looks down and journals about effects of spell. Spends a moment recalling countercharm. Theorizes about nature of spell and countercharm. Casts countercharm. Casually aims at Character A. "7 second incantation"

Character A: Waits patiently for spell to hit.

Or there's the classic mentioning of times. 'Usually duels take only ten minutes each (WTF?SRSLY), but Harry's megaduel took three hours' (OMG, has this author never been in any sort of physical confrontation?)

Totally agree with you, a little bit of combat realism could go a long way.
