  Why aren't there more Stephen Hawkings?

Well, by this logic, most people /can't/ be Dumbledore for the same reason most people can't be Stephen Hawking: most people don't have that level of native talent or intelligence. I actually don't have a problem with that as long as Dumbledore's power level (for lack of a better term) is more along the lines of Usain Bolt or Stephen Hawking than it is Superman or Professor X.

I'll note that we do get one clue from canon, where Fake!Moody is describing the Unforgivable Curses:

  "/Avada Kedavra's/ a curse that needs a powerful bit of magic behind it--you could all get your wands out now and point them at me and say the words, and I doubt I'd get so much as a nosebleed."

Taken literally, this would suggest that one Death Eater is more powerful than an entire classroom full of fourth years (assuming Barty isn't lying). I suspect the real reason is more along the lines of "You have to mean it." But it does still suggest that magical power levels are a thing, since the students didn't see anything wrong with that statement.

My headcanon is probably closer to HPMOR, where more powerful spells are indeed "smarter" and more efficient, but spamcasting any spell for long enough will tire you out.
