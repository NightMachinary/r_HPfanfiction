  So hypothetically, two wizards equal in these areas could duel ad infinitum?

Yes. We even saw it when Dumbledore fought Voldemort. It was only Dumbledore's superior /use/ of magic that won the duel, not his inherent or trained up power with which he outlasted Voldemort.

It also didn't take Harry physical strength to hold the Priori Incantatem, but Will.

I do concede, however, that in one way both parties can eventually be exhausted. Magic certainly takes focus. We all know that doing something for a long time lets focus slip. I can only guess that wand movements, incantations spoken or thought,... become off with time due to the casters mind having exhausted itself.

  Then why aren't there more of him?

Why aren't there more Stephen Hawkings? Because it's damn hard to wrap your mind around concepts of such abstractness /and/ make use of them. I'm thinking in a population around the 15.000, which is an often used estimate based on the numbers we get to see, having 2 geniuses, Dumbledore and Voldemort, is a very good average for a nation.

And we also know, because it is told to us, that just a league beneath those two goliaths, we have a wide variety of wizards and witches who count as above average, or even masterful in their skill. Minerva McGonagall, Bellatrix Lestrange, Flitwick, Snape, Sirius, Remus, Tonks, Kingsley, Moody,........ Why aren't there more of them? I think there are enough.

But I will give you that: We are only told they are skillfull witches and wizards, but never really see it. However, this is a general shortcoming of Rowling's writing and I always chose to interpret canon in the light of Rowling's tendencies, shortcomings and strengths and not just latch onto some perceived hole in the lore steming from an authors focus.
