I definitely agree with your points, but I still think there are some inherent differences in magical strength from person to person. I don't think two people each using a banishing charm on a ball will produce identical results. However, there are definitely some exceptions. An Avada Kedavra used by a Death Eater will produce the same results as one from Voldemort himself.

I would argue that there are more Hawkings but they aren't as well known. This is also assuming some or all factors of intelligence are not genetic. It is possible that more magical goliaths exist but are not involved in the story.

Also, although I don't think there's any way to directly compare the above-average population, there must be another factor to put a younger witch i.e. Tonks on the same level as McGonagall, who clearly has the experience advantage.
