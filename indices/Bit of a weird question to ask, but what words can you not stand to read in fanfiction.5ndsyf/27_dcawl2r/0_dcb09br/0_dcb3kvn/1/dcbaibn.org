  Knowledge, Wisdom and Skill are the limits of magic

So hypothetically, two wizards equal in these areas could duel ad infinitum? My personal view is that magic is like a muscle. Work with it and build it up to make it stronger, but eventually your spells will lose strength and focus.

Then why aren't there more of him? I understand not everyone has the age/wisdom/drive to become his equal but your telling me theoretically only one or two wizards per generation will work toward that goal? I guess it depends on the population size but it seems unlikely.
