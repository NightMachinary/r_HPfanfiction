  Basically, there have to be some limits, or it breaks the story

This is what I don't get. There /are/ limits, without exhaustion or cores. Knowledge, Wisdom and Skill are the limits of magic. The mind sets the limits. Dumbledore isn't so powerful because of his magical muscle being super-strong or his core super-big. Dumbledore is so powerful because he delved into the depths of magic and has an understanding of concepts that most of the magical world finds utterly incomprehensible. Its not your magical stamina or your manapool that sets the limits, its the capacity of your intelligence, of your creativity and your dedication to learning and growing.

That has always been the greatest about Harry Potter. It wasn't some magical system that kept the limits, it was only the characters and their minds. In HP, in theory, the limit of magic is infinite and in practice it is as limited as you let yourself be. In theory, everybody could be a Dumbledore.

And wasn't that just the greatest message Rowling was sending there?
