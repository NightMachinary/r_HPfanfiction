That's a bit silly. McGonagall clearly had the knowledge, wisdom, and skill to make 32 giant chess golems in first year that acted independently and with some permanence. The board even created more between games, the pieces lasted for years, and they couldn't simply be hit with a finite.

If it wasn't mentally or physically debilitating to do so, she could simply transfigure endless amounts of them, only pausing to eat or sleep. There could've been potentially thousands of the things following the lead of the Hogwarts' suits of armor during the final battle if she'd given herself enough time to prepare.

Rowling left things open-ended enough that having factors like a finite 'pool' of 'mana' or tying that into one's physical state is only sensible. It's certainly the most obvious solution without introducing new elements.
