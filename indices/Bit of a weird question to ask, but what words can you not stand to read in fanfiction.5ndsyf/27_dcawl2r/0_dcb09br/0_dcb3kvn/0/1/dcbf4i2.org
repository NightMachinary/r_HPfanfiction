  If it wasn't mentally or physically debilitating to do so, she could simply transfigure endless amounts of them, only pausing to eat or sleep. There could've been potentially thousands of the things following the lead of the Hogwarts' suits of armor during the final battle if she'd given herself enough time to prepare.

Time is another constraint.

(In a tabletop roleplaying game I play, GURPS, time is the primary factor limiting magic items -- you can cast a spell ten times in a row and repeat that every hour, but if you want a magic staff to replicate the same spell, it's three years in the making. I think they took balance a little too far...)

For the chess set, it didn't take more than two months of dedicated effort to produce it -- she might have spent the summer hols on the project. McGonagall might not have started preparing in earnest until 1995, and Hogwarts fell in, what, 1997? That left two summers of dedicated preparation. She could at least have generated 64 animated statues, I'd think. But if there were other preparations she wanted to accomplish, ones that were perhaps more effective, then it might have been unreasonable for her to complete those and the statues both.
