  It's certainly the most obvious solution without introducing new elements.

But... you are introducing new elements. That's literally what you do. You introduce a manapool to the lore instead of trying to figure out some way to explain things /without/ introducing something new.

Yes, Rowling did leave things open ended. Which is a great thing, giving us fanfiction authors all the freedom we want to write and do whatever. It frustrates me greatly that so many authors then go ahead and introduce a video-game mechanic. Tying the magic of Harry Potter to a stamina/manapool mechanic defies the message of the books, which is why I despise them so.
