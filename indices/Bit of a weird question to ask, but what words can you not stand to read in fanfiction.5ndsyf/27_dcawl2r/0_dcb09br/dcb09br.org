I don't use magical cores; the whole concept is silly. But I do see magic as being a finite "biological" resource, like glucose or oxygen. Under normal conditions, if you're healthy, you don't have to worry about running out of any of them, but if you do the magical equivalent of running a marathon (whatever that might be), you're going to be pretty exhausted. Basically, there have to be /some/ limits, or it breaks the story.
