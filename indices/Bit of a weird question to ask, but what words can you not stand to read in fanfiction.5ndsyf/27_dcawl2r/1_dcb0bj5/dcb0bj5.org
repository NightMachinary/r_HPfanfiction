  Seriously, don't include magical cores in your fics. Ever. As inspired as your use of them may be, don't include them.

I'm fine with them. Magical cores in fanfiction can do the same thing they do in games: introduce resource management which makes fights more interesting. That can be /good/ (for example, a number of fight/duel scenes in Dodging Prison).

It's bad when it's just an excuse to make Harry OP so that the fights /aren't/ interesting.
