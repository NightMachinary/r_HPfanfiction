  Magical cores in fanfiction can do the same thing they do in games
#+end_quote

Dear Lord that sentence made me cringe. Thats the same mindset that lets movies about videogames become shit.

Other media means other rules. Ressource Pools in videogames are interesting and exciting because you engage in a competition that includes the management of said ressource in real time, with real counters and as of yet undecided outcomes.

As long as the author doesn't include an actual counter, any number and any status of a core you read is a completely arbitrary number that only serves to build some cheap tension. There is no inherent excitement in the matching of two energy pools in the media of text and prosa. None. Magical Cores are a cheap out, as they let someone simply state "Dueler A's core is depleted. Now Dueler B has the upper hand." - or you get the infamous Anime-galore scene in which Harry has his core deplete and through +the power of friendship found in the Guild of FairyTail+ some herculean effort and maybe some screaming he overcomes the enemy anyway, because of course he does. It gets authors out of the precarious situation to actually think of how a character would have to out-think an opponent by creativity, intelligence and tactics.

Also, if that is different in Dodging Prison, then that's nice for the fic. I never understood what the fuzz was about with that fic. I only remember that he, a 20 year old (?) thinks about stealing the eight year old girlfriend of his brother. Yeah... that was the point I kinda noped outta there.
