"core" "magical core"

I get an eye twitch every time I see it written. /Especially/ if its written like its just a fact of canon, as if the fandom /knows/ there are magical cores, when there is not even a hint of such a thing existing.

I have stopped reading good fanfictions because magical cores or magical exhaustion was mentioned. It just kills one great aspect of Harry Potter, being: /no goddamn manapools/.

Seriously, don't include magical cores in your fics. Ever. As inspired as your use of them may be, don't include them.
