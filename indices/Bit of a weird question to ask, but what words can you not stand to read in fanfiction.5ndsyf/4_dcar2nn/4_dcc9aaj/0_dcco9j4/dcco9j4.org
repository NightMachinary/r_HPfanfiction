It's completely reasonable to struggle, it's hard! I've been called out on anachronisms in my latest fic that I hadn't considered. I don't include spellings for this reason - I'm not going to adapt my writing for the comfort of an American audience, you shouldn't have to for me. We can all learn to adjust.

But when it comes to words and phrases, certain things can be jarring. It's not that your characters have to talk like they're in Downton Abbey, but try to think whether you've ever seen/read anything British where they've said it. You'll gradually learn which words to pick up. It's a good idea to make friends with a Brit who doesn't mind answering your questions or giving your work a quick read through (Hi!)
