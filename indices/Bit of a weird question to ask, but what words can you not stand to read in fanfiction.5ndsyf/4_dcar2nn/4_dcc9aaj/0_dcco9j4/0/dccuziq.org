Thanks! That's pretty great advice! I'll keep at it. I've definitely noticed sometimes where the characters don't talk quite right- usually it's Snape sounding a bit too casual or the word "mom". You know, really obvious stuff. I want to get better partly because it probably bothers people who recognize it more, and because it's just fun to learn the small differences in words or phrases, haha.
