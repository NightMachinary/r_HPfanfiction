I'm not sure what you mean by modern, I think I'm a bit older than you so I would dispute that it is modern. However, I did look at the OED and its is American in origin, with one of the earliest written uses in the UK quoted from The Mirror from 1968

'1968 Daily Mirror 27 Aug. 7/5 If people insist on talking about her boobs, she would rather they called them boobs, which is a way-out word,..rather than breasts.'

You live and learn.
