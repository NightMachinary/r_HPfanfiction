Well we do have bacon and fireworks in the UK, with an entire evening set aside every year to set off fireworks and burn effigies on bonfires. Some of us even have boobs too, though I would prefer authors used the proper British term "tits".

But actually as OP was looking for words rather than broader American concepts/themes like guns or Harry having st Mungo's bills to pay (annoying enough), so I was thinking more like sidewalk instead of path/pavement, blocks instead of streets or alleys, candy instead of chocolate, references to downtown and people saying God dammit.

I appreciate people don't always know the British equivalent and although it can irk me I'm not someone who insists authors need to use British spelling (unless you whinge about me using single quotation marks...), but I think people should at least try to remember that the series takes place in the UK.
