#+begin_quote
  But how the hell did people come up with that apostrophe?
#+end_quote

That phrase is often used to denote residency, so people probably saw someone use "The Weasley's" to refer to the Weasley home, misunderstood what the person meant, and then started to use it as a plural denotion.

#+begin_quote
  Let's go visit the Weasley's
#+end_quote

This refers to going to visit the home.

#+begin_quote
  Let's go visit the Weasleys
#+end_quote

This refers to going to visit the family of people.

Its an understandable mistake, if a little annoying one.
