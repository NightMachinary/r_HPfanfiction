[[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/punctuation/apostrophe][Oxford dictionaries]] said we use it after if you're not using s's, as does [[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/learningenglish/grammar/learnit/learnitv57.shtml][BBC]]. The HP novels also use:

#+begin_quote
  On the other hand, allowing Harry to disappear to the Weasleys' for the rest of the summer (GOF, Ch3)
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  the Weasleys' house burst with the strange and unexpected (COS, Ch4)
#+end_quote

(That's UK editions, 2004 reprints and the digital releases.)
