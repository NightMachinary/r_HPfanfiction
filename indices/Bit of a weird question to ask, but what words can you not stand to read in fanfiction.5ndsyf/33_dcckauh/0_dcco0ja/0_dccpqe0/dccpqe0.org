You would actually need an apostrophe in the first example, it just goes after the s rather than before. In full the phrase would actually be "Let's go visit the Weasleys' home." 'Home' (or whatever other location they're at) is implied, which is why we can drop it, but you should still use an apostrophe to denote the possessive, and because it belongs to all the Weasleys instead of just one Weasley the apostrophe goes after the s. (Theoretically you could use Weasleys's, but that's apparently supposed to be used only when you pronounce the extra s, e.g. Jones's, but personally I never like seeing it. I think it looks weird.)
