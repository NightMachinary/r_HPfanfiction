But any definition of the word "scream" describes it as the /sound/ So you can't have a silent scream, just like you can't have silent thunder or a silent boom or silent cacophony. All those words describe sounds. If you're talking about the face someone makes when they scream, that could be a grimace probably.

And I believe they do mean silent sobs, which makes me wonder why they don't just say "silent sobs" as it sounds a lot better. Or if they wanted to get adventurous they could write about emotional people who actually make sounds. :P I think a character losing control and emoting loudly has a bigger impact than all this "silent" nonsense.

Edit: "sobbing" is a noise too. Huh. So let's just go with my other idea and nix the whole "silent" thing altogether. :D
