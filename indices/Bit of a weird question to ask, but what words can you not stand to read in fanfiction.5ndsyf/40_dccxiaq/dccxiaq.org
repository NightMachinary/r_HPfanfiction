I completely agree with OP with <insert colour> orbs. Crimson orbs, emerald orbs, sapphire orbs etc. Then there's ridiculous colours eg.cerulean, a colour I think only exists in fanfiction. Cringey curse words are a pet peeve too. But by far the worst is epithets, particularly when trying to avoid shared pronouns, for example:

#+begin_quote
  The older man looked into the younger man's cerulean orbs and cried 'oh my goddesses'.
