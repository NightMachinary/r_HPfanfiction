Mine is kinda weird but it is when "man" is over-used rather than just saying "him" or the person's name. Here is an example:

"Snape's eyes closed and Harry wondered if the man was going to finally pass out. He carefully climbed back onto the bed and worked to finish healing all the wounds. Once done, he checked on the man, realizing he was breathing evenly."

It is all over in the fic [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=10818&chapter=21][Secrets]] by Vorabiza and is what makes me hate that fic even though it is really popular with Drarry fans.

Similarly, using too many descriptors in place of people's names or pronouns - like "she couldn't take her eyes off of the raven haired boy." I guess it is considered good writing to have descriptions, but everyone knows what Harry looks like, so it just makes me cringe when I read it.
