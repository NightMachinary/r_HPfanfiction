Giving epithets (short descriptions in place (or as a prefix/suffix to) a name) is an ancient technique to break up the flow of monotony by referring to someone by name or a pronoun over and over again. It was first used (commonly) by Homer in his Illiad and Odyssey. Though it has fallen out of practice in modern writing because most people prefer a snappier read, which epithets crush rather adroitly. I understand why you might get frustrated or turned off by it. But seeing things like that is the mark of a well read author. Though the constant use of 'man' is just lazy.
