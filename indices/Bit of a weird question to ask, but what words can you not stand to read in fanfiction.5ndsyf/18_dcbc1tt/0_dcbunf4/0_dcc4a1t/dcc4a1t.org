  But seeing things like that is the mark of a well read author.

You've obviously never read a fic where an entire thousand-word scene can include one mention of each characters' names, but fifty mentions of their hair colour, eye colour, body shape, height compared to other characters, mood, gender, and various other ways of refering to a character without using their name.

That's not a mark of being well-read, that's a sign of someone who's been told by their teachers to avoid repetition or "be exciting" and never realised that there are extremes they really don't need to go to.
