  But seeing things like that is the mark of a well read author.

To echo [[/u/SilverCookieDust]], I don't agree with this---well, not completely. You can tell when somebody uses epithets well---and sparingly---that it is a well read author. But often, it's very probably somebody who read other fanfiction and after reading "green orbed boy" decided that it is an awesome thing and like many authors before wrote "something like this, but /more/".

I once nope'd out of story, which was written like this:

#+begin_quote
  Certain bushy-haired girl smiled at her best friends, smallish green eyed boy and tall, gangly redhead. The green eyed boy with messy hair said: "You're one of a kind, Hermione".

  The buck-toothed girl replied: "Thank you, Harry."

  "Lay off, mate", said the tall redhead feeling his ears heat up at this.

And then it continued exactly like this for hundreds of thousands of words.
