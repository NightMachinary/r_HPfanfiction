Hmm. I wonder if it would actually ever fit for Dumbledore. Let's test it out.

- Dumbledore's wrinkled and saggy cheeks puffed up as he collected the air in his mouth, forcing his crusty lips shut to make sure he'd acquire the necessary effect when he'd pop his P. Once he accumulated enough pressure, he opened his mouth, letting the air escape, jiggling his lips and making the skin flaps on his cheek flap freely for a fleeting second before resting back down. Tossing a self satisfied smirk over his shoulder, Dumbledore lit a big fat blunt, spun around on his swegway, and rolled off into the sunset.

Yep. It fits.
