Prologues where literally nothing happens there besides being something to get you interested in fic then everything past that goes to complete +udder+ utter shit. If writing a prologue please use it in some way or another.

Also those stories written in such a way that it is impossible to follow along and know what is happening, especially when it is a good story just hard to follow
