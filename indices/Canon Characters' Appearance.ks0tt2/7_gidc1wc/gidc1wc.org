The more I read fanfics the more indian Harry becomes in my head which is weird. Because I'm remembering two Harry's. Old Harry from when I first read the books and now-Harry after reading so many indian descriptions of his hair and skin tone and parents.

I read Marauder fics so I've vivid images of them...

Remus is very tall. 6'5 ish. Long arms and legs that sorta hang from his body. He's always stooped. His skin is very pale with pink scars running across his nose and cheek dotted with freckles. Everything about him is knobbly, every joint and elbow. You don't often see his eyes but they're a light brown, hidden under a brown/blond messy mop of light, thin curls. He smokes and has this sternness to him. A sarcastic smirk that seems to live on the curve of his lip. He is either concentrating so hard there's a crease between his eye brows or he's raising one eyebrow at you as though questioning your decisions. He doesn't need to talk much. He is sarcastic just by looking at you ðŸ˜Š. He is casual and reserved all at the same time. Hands in his pockets and always leaning on something. It makes him look cool but it's to take the weight of his joints. He limps slightly when he walks. Hes one of those people who wouldn't take up space in a room but when he does he commands it. Can take on the whole world just by raising his chin and standing up straight (not that he does it often...) And God love this boy but he is always in brown and beige.

I got carried away sorry. I'll be here for days if I do the other three ðŸ˜‚.
