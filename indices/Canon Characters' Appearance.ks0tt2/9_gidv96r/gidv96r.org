Ron is tall and lowkey kind of buff, he gives off rugged mountain main vibes,

Draco is posh aristocratic type prettyboy vibes like the kpop boys.

Harry is dorky cute, messy hair, big glasses, kind short for a dude but not too short, sometimes indian sometimes not depends on the story

Pansy/Ginny both give me super hot tall leggy model vibes, with Ginny being more fit and she has abs

Luna is kind of on the skinny side and of average height, she also gives off that soft prettygirl look that kpop stars have

Hermione is short and depending on my mood either lightskinned or just white, and pretty curvy,

Blaise/Dean are the epitome of tall dark and handsome straight up
