In theory I don't mind Indian-heritage Harry and black Hermione, but I've begun to associate them with types of stories I don't enjoy. I found that when authors do decide to specify their races, it's rare to merely mention it and much more regular for race and racial discrimination to be a major theme of the story. That in itself is /not/ a negative thing, but it is also not something I personally want to focus on in a HP story, you know? (Some that I've read can also be quite heavy on teenage angst so there's that deterrent too.)

As for how I visualise characters, I'm mostly influenced by the movies. Just can't help it, the image exists and it pops up! There's only few characters whose actor counterparts I do/can disregard; The Marauders. Gary Oldman included, as much as I like the man.

To me, adult Sirius usually resembles [[https://pin.it/7gC2EIE][Aragorn]] from LOTR films but with [[https://pin.it/6CjB0ma][Rufus]] Sewell's general eye area (My headcanon Sirius needs open lids, I'm sorry Oldman, Mortensen..), and the teenage version resembles a model I found on pinterest, [[https://pin.it/5BwrAkK][Maxene Danet Fauvel]]. From there I intentionally continued searching for photos of boys/men onto whom I could project the rest of the Marauders. Here's what I've ended up with: [[https://pin.it/5HL0wpB][Dan Stevens in the role of Peter P.]], [[https://pin.it/3ApSCZh][Luke Powell as R.A.B]] (not part of the squad ik, but usually involved in their stories), [[https://pin.it/6ZEdgUb][Tobey Maguire as James P.]] (but with coarser hair and a more pointy nose)...Remus I haven't quite settled on yet, but something about this [[https://pin.it/2uJBEdW][young man]]'s face speaks to me. The expression is very reminiscent of the film (adult) Lupin, I think.

Also there's Walburga Black who seems to be by many fans imagined as [[https://pin.it/99PCdAC][Eva Green]] and I could get behind that one. But then I saw this [[https://pin.it/aAT4lm2][lady]] and my brain just claimed /this woman gave birth to Sirius Black!!/

And of course! Here's [[https://pin.it/Fw9x4CS][Lily Evans!!]] Something about her face resonates right for the role to me. There's the trademark red hair green eye combo, naturally. The only thing I see different in my mind's eye is that her lips are much thinner than the good lady who's likeness I linked.

Hermione is amongst those who's actress imprinted onto me, but I definitely do imagine her with curlier and more voluminous hair than Emma has.
