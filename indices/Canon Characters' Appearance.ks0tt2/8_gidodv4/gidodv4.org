I love this!!

I dont really see the skin colors as different. I mean, I see characters like the trio, Oliver Wood, Katie Bell, Marcus Flint, etc as white but characters like Dean, Lee, Angelina, etc. Are black and Cho is asian. I just don't picture it as any different, haven't really ever thought it honestly.

1. Harry is short. He and Hermione are kind of around the same height. And some writers write him as having longer hair-nooo I can't picture that. In my mind, his hair is how Daniel had his in PoA.

2. Seamus is short like Harry but maybe a little taller. They're the shortest boys in their dorm (I like short guys so this is kind of where this comes from lol)

3. Katie Bell is a blonde. She's of medium height, not too tall or too short. She's a tomboy, so she's always seen in something casual when not in her quidditch/school uniform and her best friend is Oliver. She usually wears her hair in a high ponytail or two braids (where they start at the top of her head)

4. People usually write Marcus Flint as being super tall and with a lot of muscles. I don't see it. In my mind, he's of average height, maybe learning toward 6' but he's not really muscular. He also secretly has glasses but he doesn't like to wear them because they almost look like Harry's

5. Bill, Charlie and Percy are the taller Weasley boys. Ron is taller than Hermione or Harry but he only stands at 5'10 or 5'11. His older brothers (the three I mentioned) are over 6 foot

6. Colin Creevey has dirty blonde hair but Dennis is a brunette.

7. Percy has bright blue eyes (I don't know if this was mentioned in canon or not) and if anyone paid attention, those were his most expressive feature.

8. The Dursleys are brunette. Dudley eventually got himself in much better shape. Vernon did not

9. Adrian is pretty much how his actor looks in the 2nd movie
