Draco is almost as tall as Ron but carries himself much better (shoulders rolled back, walks with his chin lifted up, etc). Like I think I imagine around 6'2" ish for both. Harry is barely 6'0", and I cringe at fics that write him being one of the tallest characters (not sure why every characterization is a valid one!!!). Hermione and Luna are average height at 5'5", and I always imagined Ginny as being on the short side, like 5'3".

Didn't imagine Indian Harry until I started reading some fics, but I really do love the idea of him having some color to him! It's something I can't unimagine. I have a harder time with imagining Hermione as Black for some reason (even though as a Black woman I desperately want to), and I don't think any of the Weasleys are completely covered head to toe in freckles in my head. Draco and Luna are extremely pale.

Draco does not have silver hair, it's just blond, (I think I imagine Luna's closer to this silver color that I see in so many fics) Hermione just needs some good conditioner so I don't typically imagine her as having this massively bushy hair, and Harry's "messy hair" is a mix of neglect and genetics. And the Weasley's hair is orange!!
