Oooh I think I can definitely see a light-skinned Hermione! I completely agree with you about how the actress for cursed child and Emma Watson both weren't completely accurate in the way someone like Rupert Grint was for me (he's the closest to my imagination of Ron, although in my head Ron's face is thinner), which is why I might struggle with imagining Hermione as being dark skinned. And I completely agree with the malnutrition having a role in Harry's height, and I think Ginny being short is fitting for the running joke of short people are the most fiery :) Just seems funnier in my head to have her wildness in a smaller package!!!
