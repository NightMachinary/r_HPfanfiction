Harry is described as short in the first few books but is actually described as being kind of tall in the last few. While I don't think he's as tall as Ron or other tall characters, I don't think in cannon he was suffering from the effects of malnutrition. I think he just had a late growth spurt. I'd say his height by the end of the books was probably 5'10 or 5'11
