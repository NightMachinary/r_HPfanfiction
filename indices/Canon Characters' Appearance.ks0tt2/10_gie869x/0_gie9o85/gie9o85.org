The reason why Harry is often short is due to the effects of malnutrition. It tends to stunt growth. I imagined Ginny as short too, I wonder why that stands out. As for Hermione being black, I tend to imagine her as having a lighter shade of black skin, with her having surprisingly light hair. The actress who they got for cursed child was good from what I could see, but I couldn't see her Hermione any more than Emma Watson. I have a hard time picturing a massive bush on her head too, especially in their later years. Once it gets to that point conditioner doesn't work the same.
