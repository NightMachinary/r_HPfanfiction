Because I picture Harry with curly hair, I imagine James's haircut emphasizes the windswept curls, while Harry just has a mop on his head. I like the idea of them having those same appearance quirks, but presented in different ways. Like they both have the windswept messy vibe, but Harry's has his Dudley cast offs giving him more of an, 'I don't care' vibe, while James has expensive and well-fitted clothes that he messes up for the appearance.
