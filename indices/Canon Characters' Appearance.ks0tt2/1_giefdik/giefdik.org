Overarchingly, a little by how JKR portrayed them canonically (in description), but mostly their actors/actresses (for example, Emma Watson with more bushy hair than the elegant curls she had in the later movies) that JKR had direct hand in casting -- so no Blackmione or Desi-Harry (those two always make me facepalm, to be honest).

The one exception is that I always picture Ginny not as Bonnie Wright but as a younger-looking Karen Gillan.
