Because there's no evidence whatsoever of Harry having Indian ancestry aside from some vague, coincidental connection about Diwali happening the same time as Halloween. You may as well claim Lily Evans/Potter had veela or vampire ancestry by the same logic. Heck, it's so vague that it'd even embarrass conspiracy theorists!

I mean, it's great for an AU fic and all, but these people genuinely believe that canon Harry, the guy we see in the books and portrayed by Daniel Radcliffe, is Indian in some way.

Frankly, it and Blackmione are appropriations of white characters. And no, before anyone thinks "it", I'd be just as pissed if characters of other ethnicities were claimed to be others, too. HP is surprisingly diverse and has undertones of acceptance and anti-racism (in the form of blood status) -- you don't need to create or force diversity.

Amusingly enough, Desi-Harry was originally pushed by Indian HP fans who were also of a nationalistic bent (yeah, I have no idea either why they were trying to claim a skinny white kid with green eyes as being Indian in some way), and it took off in the Indian HP fan community, which spread out into the main one.
