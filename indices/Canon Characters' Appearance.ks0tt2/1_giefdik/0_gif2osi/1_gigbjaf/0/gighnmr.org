Why would we all be upset about you thinking that characters are canonically a different color? The whole point of this thread is to share our opinions. I've not been trying to criticize yours, but to understand them. If it came across as me criticizing them, I'm sorry. I've been trying to respond to everyone, as I like it when people respond to my thoughts as well.

I hope I can speak for everyone posting on this thread that we aren't picturing them as different races out of a desire for forced diversity, or a nationalistic bent. I'm white, and I still picture Harry as Indian. [[/u/Flat_Ear6039][u/Flat_Ear6039]] is apparently a black woman, and she doesn't see Hermione Granger as black.

The thing I'll criticize you for is critiquing these people for not being 100% canon-compliant. We're writing /fanfiction/. These characters aren't defined by their skin, and the story doesn't in any way thematically revolve around the color of their skin. The worldbuilding doesn't fall apart if a character changes color. If it did, I wouldn't picture Harry as Indian.

This isn't a knock against you, I have no issues with the characters being white.

>I mean, it's great for an AU fic and all, but these people genuinely believe that canon Harry, the guy we see in the books and portrayed by Daniel Radcliffe, is Indian in some way.

But this is insulting. We do not picture them that way out of malice or ignorance. We do it because it makes sense to us. Sorry if this is a bit rude. I understand why you picture them like the actors, but not all of us do. Your image makes perfect sense, there is no need to criticize others for picturing things differently.
