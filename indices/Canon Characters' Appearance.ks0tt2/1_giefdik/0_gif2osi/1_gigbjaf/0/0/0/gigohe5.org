No, I definitely understood your views from minute one. To be honest, I didn't like the Ivy/Harley done in Harley Quinn. It's been done better, and Kiteman was pretty good. I'm happy to see that your point was that we can't change the canon, not that it was wrong to picture these characters as other races. I'm a bit disappointed in some of the characters who seem to be defined by their diversity, rather than just them being diverse. I didn't love Miles Morales until Spider-Verse, and I don't think I'll ever like Riri Williams.

Here's a thought though, why do we care so much about the races for these characters? I mean, it's not super important world-building, like in Earthsea, or crucial to their arcs like Remember the Titans. It's just their appearance. It's the same as imagining a pretty-boy Draco, or Post-DH Ron having a beard. I will never argue Harry actually being Indian, but I do like him that way. It feels like an issue which only matters in the terms of movies, or more visual media. But who knows?
