Because, in this day and age, if you voice an opinion that may seen controversial to other people, you often always get screamed at for 'being' a number of things, such as being a racist, a sexist, homophobic, or even the (misused) term of being a "Nazi" (and a shit-ton of other things). It happens anywhere and everywhere: from Reddit itself to forums, to YouTube comments. We live in an age where people are, well, complete snowflakes.

For example, on one forum I criticized the Harley/Ivy ship in the show Harley Quinn for a number of reasons: one, the relationship build-up was rushed, compressed, and actually unhealthy (as Harley has a co-dependency on Ivy). Ivy was also seriously dating and slated to marry Kiteman, and had genuine feelings for him, and the Harley/Ivy thing has been done to death so much that I hoped they'd go Kiteman/Ivy because it'd be a refreshing dynamic change from other media portrayals.

Within five, maybe ten posts, I was generally painted as being a homophobic bigot because I dared to have the audacity to criticize a LGTBQ relationship. So, yeah.

I guarantee you that someone reading my other comment right now is thinking "pft, what a Nazi" for having a differing view from them. It's just how the world is now.

Anyway, there is a difference between writing stories that have an AU element that diverges from canon and settings that are completely AU: the former is altered canon to fit the writer's needs, like a new branch growing from a plant, even if the branch ends up becoming something unrecognizable from the main plant -- it's still from canon. The latter is changing the plant itself, which is what I see Blackmione and Desi-Harry as part of. There's nothing wrong with that obviously (in fact, a good few of my favourite fanfics go in this direction), but there are people who genuinely believe that this plant is the canon one (to re-use the analogy), or try to change it as being the canon one.

  But this is insulting. We do not picture them that way out of malice or ignorance. We do it because it makes sense to us. Sorry if this is a bit rude. I understand why you picture them like the actors, but not all of us do. Your image makes perfect sense, there is no need to criticize others for picturing things differently.

You and others can view Harry as being of Indian ancestry: that's obviously fine and is your personal prerogative/thinking, but reality and canon says differently. Harry isn't Indian, unless something new from JKR says so. He's a skinny, white dude from Surrey that's an underdog hero, for better or ill.

Unfortunately, while you and others like you are different, there are those out there who are determined to retroactively alter characters to fit a narrative -- that includes gender and ethnicity. I've seen it across so many communities with so many different characters, it's actually disheartening (their rhetoric can be literally boiled down to "white is bad, must be diverse! It's not racist if it's against whites!").

Heck, we're even seeing it in comics, these days (although karma seems to be catching up with Marvel and DC on that front).

So, I think you can understand why my views are such.
