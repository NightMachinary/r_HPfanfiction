I really like her art, it was the cover art for the editions I had. I didn't quite have that same reaction to the actors, because after the Earthsea* special I've become unable to actually see actors as the characters for adaptations. But I definitely have issues imagining Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson as Harry, Ron, and Hermione respectively. The books just add so many minor details that they couldn't use because of the fact that they hired actors as children.
