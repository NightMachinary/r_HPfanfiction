Yeah, the Horcrux marks Harry Potter as the boy who lived. No Horcrux = died to avada kedavra = didn't live.

But still, a way for Harry to be the Horcrux and Neville to still be the 'true' boy who lived is simple - Neville has the 'power he knows not'. Ofc, that power can't be something stupid like the 'power of love'.

How about the ability to teleport anyone you can set your eyes on into the core of the Sun?
