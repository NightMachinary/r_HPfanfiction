There would be no struggles for Neville, but since the protagonist is Harry that's a moot point.

But yeah, a revenge fic against a antagonist who has the power to teleport you into the core of the goddamn sun seems like a impossible premise. Even if it was written, it would be more Dies Irae rather than anything like usual Harry Potter novels.
