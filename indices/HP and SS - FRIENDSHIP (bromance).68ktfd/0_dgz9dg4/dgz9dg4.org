linkao3(Swung by Serafim by flamethrower) has a fantastic Harry/Snape friendship. Probably the most steadily developed and realistic one that I've seen. It's also nice that it didn't fall into the usual tropes of Mentor or lovers like most fanfiction. Not slash.

linkao3(Chrysalis by starcrossedgirl) This has Harry and Snape bonding through ptsd after the war. It's slash. Very good.

linkao3(Stillllife by pir8fancier) also has a friendship and it develops quite uniquely into a romance. Slash.
