The closest I've read was [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/viewstory.php?sid=1348][A Place for Warriors]]. In that story, Harry and Snape become friendly in the canon setting, however their friendship is not as warm as what you are looking for.

In addition to the other suggestions in the thread, you also can browse fics at Potions and Snitches within the [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/browse.php?type=categories&catid=21][Comrades Snape and Harry]] category to see if anything tickles your fancy there. All the fics listed will be Gen (no slash).
