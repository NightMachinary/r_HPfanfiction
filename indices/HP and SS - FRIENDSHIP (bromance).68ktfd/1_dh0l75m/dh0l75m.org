Possibly this one, which is Snape/Harry but takes a while to get around to it, linkao3(1130477).

Harry, Ron, and Hermione invest in a magical antiques business, and they hire Snape to help them identify and restore pieces. Harry is married to Ginny at the beginning, but the marriage ends during the course of the fic, and Harry starts hanging out with Snape. There's a warm friendship vibe among the Trio, and Snape is mellower but not utterly unrecognizable.
