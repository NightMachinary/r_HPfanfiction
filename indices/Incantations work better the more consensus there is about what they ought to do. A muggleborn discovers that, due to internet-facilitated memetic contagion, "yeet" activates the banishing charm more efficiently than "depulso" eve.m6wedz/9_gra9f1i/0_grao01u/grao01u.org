Lol, except by tea-bos who attempt to use British slang and spelling to make their fanfics feel more immersive. I read a fic once where Harry lost the ability to cast in anything but Parseltongue but incantations didn't translate and he had to figure out what he intended the spell to do when he first learned it and it worked like this.

PS, I like your name. My husband and I have had several discussions about the differences between HP universe magic vs. Full Metal Alchemist. He was /not/ happy when I told him about McGonagall turning her desk into a pig in the book.
