After one insult too many from the Malfoy Harry had enough. Brandishing his wand, he screamed "Yeet!" towards the Slimy Snake. Spell resulted from the wand was so powerful, it ripped the earth in half, Sending the half containing Malfoy and the entirety of Slytherins towards the Sun thirty thousand times faster than the Speed of Light. Sheer Kinetic Energy resulted from the collision with the sun send shockwaves through the Harry Potter multiverse, destroying every version of Harry Potter universe containing Dramione, Snemione, Drarry, Tomary, Snarry, Indy Harry and Ron Bashing plots. After this multiversal Cleansing, Backlashes of the Magical shockwave erased all knowledge, hints, and proofs left of Draco Malfoy and Slytherin House or the Half of the world containing them from the world and the minds of the people except Harry. As the athmosphere of earth evaporated to space due to loosing half of its mass, Harry lay there dying like everyone else due to lack of air, A smile was on his lips as he thought it so worth it and he would do it again.
