Ginny was definitely present in Year of Darkness...but I just felt that she was just there to fill a spot. I think she holds a lot of potential as a main character (she's got gumption, she's probably very worried about her family, and she has all those demons in her past from the diary). It's been fun putting it together.

An OC can totally work. Also, I don't know if your story centers on this, but you can even pull a character who didn't go to Hogwarts. Voldemort made school education mandatory for all wizarding students in the UK. So you can have someone who was home schooled or sent somewhere else. That would be an interesting story as well. In fact, anyone's opinion outside of the main trio during this time would be interesting, lol.
