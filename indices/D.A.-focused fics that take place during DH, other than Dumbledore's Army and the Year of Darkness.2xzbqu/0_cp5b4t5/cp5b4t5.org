That was my issue with Year of Darkness as well. Neither Ginny nor Luna were romantically involved with anyone during that year, and they weren't utilized to their full potential as far as character development. I've actually been working on a story as well, with Ginny as the main character (because she rarely gets any spotlight outside of being Harry's love interest, sadly), but it will be awhile. I want to completely finish it before I post it.
