I've wanting to write a nice long Ginny-centric D.A. multi-chapter forever, but I haven't been consistent and it's a long long way from being finished. I love Ginny, and want to do more with her character.

I think Year of Darkness has become head canon for a lot of people, and it's so in-depth that it might kind of scare people off. But I do think there's a "niche" for a DA fic that puts more emphasis on Ginny.

Also the author has an /insane/ history, I can't even wrap my head around all of that level of drama and destruction.
