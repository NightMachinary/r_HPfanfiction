I'm currently writing a 10-chapter novella that follows one of the DA members during that year. Depending how that goes, I'll be adding others following different members, all set in the same 'universe'.

I'm just getting started though, 2/10 chapters posted. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11079096/1/Seven-Devils][Seven Devils]]

It's a sadly under explored year with a lot of potential so I hope to see more fics about it.
