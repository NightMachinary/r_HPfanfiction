I can deal with OOCness if there's a justification for it, if the entire premise of the fic is that it's an AU where a single life changing event has occurred to a particular character then I can accept that, I just really dislike fics where characters are different for no reason.

I can deal with certain characters acting differently if that's the point of the fic, you can't exactly have Harry become a Dark Lord or have Draco Malfoy renounce his family due to his love for Hermione Granger without some change in the character's personalities. Otherwise it's a total turn off for me I mean I'm sorry, but despite any questionable actions Dumbledore isn't actually vying for the death and misery of your favourite characters and unless there's some serious time-travel fix-it going on, Tom Riddle isn't gonna be all sunshine and rainbows either.
