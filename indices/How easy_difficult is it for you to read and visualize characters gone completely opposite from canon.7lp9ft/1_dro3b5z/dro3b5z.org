I just wanted to speak to one part of this post in order to say that I find it incredibly easy to visualize Voldemort having a child with Bellatrix. Don't imagine he was in love with her, or that he had any desire for children or an heir, or even a sex drive. Nope. None of that.

What I think about is, "Bone of the father, unknowingly given, you shall renew your son!" Body parts of family members are clearly powerful ingredients in dark rituals. And the child of Voldemort and Bellatrix would be a /firstborn/ child on both sides. Think how many jokes there are about people trading or signing away their firstborn. Clearly they're valued property for some reason.

Yep, if you ask me, Voldie's daughter is pretty damn lucky dad popped off when he did because if he'd won she would have been chopped up for potions ingredients long ago and never lived to adulthood like in the play.
