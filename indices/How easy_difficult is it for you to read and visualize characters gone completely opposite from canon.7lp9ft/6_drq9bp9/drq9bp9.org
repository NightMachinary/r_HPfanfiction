How you women can think this pale guy is hot is beyond me (yes, I am male but I can admit that somebody like Pierce Brosnan is attractive!)...

Still, it depends on the character! Harry being OC and maybe cruel? Yeah, that I can do!

Draco however? If there's a turning point event? Maybe, but not enough to make Hermione/Draco or Ginny/Draco possible! Draco IMHO just doesn't deserve a GF, he deserves a prison cell till he dies of old age IMHO and that's why I just can't read fanfictions that include Hermione/Draco...give him some pureblood-flozy and that works (still makes me cringe and wish that he is dead, but I can live with it!)
