Is it? Can you write a Harry the Genius fanfiction with canon Harry as the "driver"? No way mate! Canon Harry isn't a genius, he has no drive, he is a lazy fuck and should IMHO have died in the end (heroic sacrifice! To show that you need to actually prepare yourself to survive situations like that and that manipulative headmasters aren't good people to put your trust in!)
