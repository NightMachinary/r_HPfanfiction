To me, OOC is the worst and most often committed crime in fanfiction. It is my biggest pet peeve. There's a way to write a story with keeping the characters as close to their canon selves as possible, if you don't you're basically just slapping the same name onto an OC. Now there are those fics where people change who they are etc. This can be done well according to the character, how well thought out it was, why they turned, how long it took (It shouldn't be anything like a few weeks, it should be months--again according to who the character is, what happened in their lives etc).

Some characters you can't change, I feel, without ruining them, like Voldemort or Bellatrix, I just got done torturing myself with a fic where Bellatrix/Harry are in the Chamber of Secrets when Harry rapes her to avenge Sirius, she likes it and in 2 minutes they fall in love, he helps her escape and keeps her hidden, all in the first chapter. It's just not plausible, if you wanted to attempt to make it so you'd have to really work hard at it, not chapter 1, not after them talking to each other in what would be 2 minutes in real life.

Things like this are not okay. I could go on forever about this
