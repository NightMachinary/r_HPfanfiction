I never understood how anyone found Draco good looking. I think that is mostly due to a German YouTube parody in which Dobby describes Draco along the following lines:

#+begin_quote
  You ought to know the boy. His entire body is thoroughly coated with lube. Even his hair is dripping with it. Do you know the expression "crawling into somebody's ass"? [sucking up to somebody] He takes that literally.
#+end_quote

Having seen that ten years ago I could never unsee that mental image and the fact that Draco has two boys following him everywhere did not help. And to me as a guy, a good-looking man is Arnold Schwarzenegger in his prime, not some 16/17-year-old wannabe member of the magical Hitler-Youth.

Nasty Ron, however, is something I have no problems imagining because I had more than one "friend" fuck me over. Perhaps I am just cynical but I can totally see Ron being a dick and turning on Harry or Hermione happening. I can get behind a Machiavellian Dumbledore who uses Harry as a pawn but an evil Dumbledore or Death Eater Ron is just too OOC to be convincing. Same with Ginny or Molly slipping Harry a love potion. That seems somewhat plausible. But Molly running an empire with her potions or a happy Weasley family potion scheme is too far fetched.
