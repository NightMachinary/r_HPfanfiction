These are not two words I'd use together. But I guess it comes down to preference.

Personally, I never saw how Draco was forced to do anything. He had choices (sneaking his mother to Heathrow under an invisibility cloak and running to Auckland, going to Dumbledore for help) but he chose to commit treason, use Unforgivables and he broke the Geneva convention in the process, making him a war criminal. A suitcase filled with Galleons would have set them for life but he made several assassination attempts instead of running if he was not into the cause.

I mean, yeah, he was in a tough spot but he really just got what he asked for (the return of the Dark Lord) and others had a way worse hand to deal with. Andromeda, Edward, Teddy and Nymphadora "I have to die for the trope" Tonks, Harry "I am fate's bitch" Potter, Fleur "Molly, Ginny and Ron are my in-laws" Weasley, Hermione "JKR thinks that fighting and belittling makes a successful relationships" Weasley or even Luna "My mother died and my father is no fit caretaker" Lovegood to name just a few.
