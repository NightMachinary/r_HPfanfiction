  These are not two words I'd use together. But I guess it comes down to preference.

Yes, I can see that. Angst (in moderation at least) is a guilty pleasure of mine, but I can understand why someone wouldn't like it. I have moods where I enjoy it as long as it's not too much which is why I enjoyed his arc. I don't think that he was a good person or that he did not have other choices or that other characters did not have it worse. I just find the actor attractive in real life which helps me feel better about him and enjoy the arc of "snobby rich kid given almost impossible task he doesn't want to do by organization he thought was awesome and him freaking out about it". I am sure he could have left the country, but that would be a lot more boring to read about instead of watching him struggle with actually killing someone after all his talk about how great the death eater ideals are.

I do like redemption arcs though and the thought that people can change for the better even if they start out as a total asshole, no matter how unlikely that is. Not someone I would ever want to meet in real life, but entertaining and interesting to read about or watch in movies/TV. Seems to be fairly common and popular trope for a lot of fandoms so I can't be the only one either since those characters are often very popular.
