I grew up with the Harry Potter movies and Draco has always been Tom Felton to me. Even when he was younger I have always thought he was kind of cute/not bad looking, now as an adult I think he is quite attractive so it's I think easier for me to visualize him as not a bad guy. I am not a fan of the gelled hair look, but without it he looks fine. I don't know if I can say I care for Draco that much, but his arc in HBP was wonderfully angsty and did a good job of portraying him more sympatherically as someone who has been forced to do things that he doesn't want to do at the threat of his family and his own life. He seems nice in real life too so it's easier to ignore his bad and whiny behavior in the movies.

Plus I saw him in Arrow recently and he has gotten better looking I think (Or maybe I am just over the phase of where I used to be into emo looking guys, haha).

But as a girl, I have to say that it may be that I just don't find Arnold or any super strong muscle guys very attractive. Someone like present day Tom Felton is just way sexier to me than bodybuilder Arnold in his prime with bulging muscles or his terminator look.
