Yeah! Could go for some mononymic thing-suffix kind of names too. Ravensholme or the like. Or something named to mark something local, maybe it's built on a green hill in Wales so the place is called 'bryn gwyrdd'. Plenty of ideas for names, and I say that as someone who can't name places for shit.

Still gotta keep it short though. Remember, people have to shout this shit out when they're floo'ing.
