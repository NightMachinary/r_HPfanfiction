I mean, we've never really seen the Magical World be all that good at security. Their unrobbable bank was basically robbed twice (Quirrell only didn't get the Stone because Hagrid had removed it earlier), Hogwarts basically had an open door danger policy, and the Ministry would lose a fight with a badly behaved blancmange. So, it'd fit for them to not really take that into concern.
