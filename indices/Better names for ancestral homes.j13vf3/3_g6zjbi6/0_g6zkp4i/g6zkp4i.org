I love your first few points and yeah the Malfoys coming over with William the Conqueror makes sense for them to have a keep or something that later developed into one. it wouldn't surprise me about the long bottom and I'd love it to be true it's a shame Jkr was so ignorant. While we don't have as fleshed out as a history of the blacks so we can't really say how the black estate is and what it consists of as we know that they at least think they are wizard of royalty and in a world like there's high society wouldn't let them get away with claiming that especially in a world with the Malfoys I wish we got a bit more insight into his inheritance from Sirius and how it's worked because the inner details really make a story for me
