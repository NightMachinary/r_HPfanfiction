I doubt most of them know to be honest it doesn't seem like something they would know I know they'd know the main family history but that seems irrelevant as once you get to a certain level like them it's just assumed they've always been there and we can tell that Malfoys are likely lower then the blacks as the next head of the family married a black from the cadet line and Belatrix married a lestrange who are also a massive influential family. We don't know if they all claim that it could very well be a title that slowly became associated with them over the years
