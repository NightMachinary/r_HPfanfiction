My own headcanon for the Longbottoms, as an old family from a part of the country with a deep magical heritage is that their family seat is Malkin Tower. It was the home of the family at the centre of the Pendle Witch trials: in our universe, its location is lost to history. In the Potterverse, there's a parcel of land on the moor above Newchurch-in-Pendle that's hidden from the muggles...

(It also remedies JKR's shocking ignorance of the /actual/ magical history of the country her books are set in.)

Malfoy Manor makes sense in light of the bit JKR gave out about the Malfoys coming over with William The Bastard: Armand Malfoy was granted the manor for services rendered during the Harrying of the North, and the family have lived at two sites within the Manor: up until the 17th century, in Malfoy Castle on the highest hill in the Manor. Thereafter, on the proceeds of nefarious dealings they built the current Malfoy Manor House on a stretch of upland across the river from the castle in order to get away from their muggle tenants in the village.

Grimmauld Place is only one of many houses included in the Black family entails and was the only piece of real property settled on Sirius before he ran away from home. The settlement was ironclad enough that it couldn't be revoked when he went to Azkaban, although everything else in the Black estate beside some minor investments got settled elsewhere while he was inside. The Blacks aren't as 'ancient' as they crack on they are, so the property portfolio didn't include a castle or a stately home, just a /lot/ of really nice houses all over the place. The result is that when Harry inherits from Sirius all he got was really just the house and some cash.

(In case you hadn't caught on yet, I do actually know how real property and inheritance law and settled estates work: Sirius had living family when he got imprisoned and they absolutely would have cut him out of as much of the inheritance as they lawfully could.)

Want me to go on? I've got a lovely one for the Parkinsons on the basis that a family by that name endowed a chapel and school in the Forest of Bowland...
