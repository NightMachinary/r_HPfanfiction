Literally there's so many names if they insist on having the family name in it to switch it up a bit like it's unlikely to even have their family name as the actual name of the house it may informally be called Malfoy Manor but it likely has a proper name. And the grumpily place thing annoys me aswell especially when they try say it's the black ancestral home like no that's just their London home they very likely have a country estate with a stately home
