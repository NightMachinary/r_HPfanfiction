Agree so hard. It's one of my smaller pet peeves when every ancestral home is named manor -- Potter Manor, Longbottom Manor, Nott Manor, Greengrass Manor. I've even seen Weasley Manor and people calling Grimmauld Place ‘Black Manor'. It's honestly annoying. ‘Malfoy Manor' has its merit because of ‘M -- M', but there's so much more words authors could use -- estate, hall, lodge, park, cottage or it could simply be a name without a mention of a family name like Netherfield or Pemberley. It's a small thing but one that can make story less generic and more atmospheric.
