I have a headcanon (and it's something I intend to include in any future story I may or may not write) that the Greengrass ancestral home is called "Verdant Villa", in part because it's an actual Ancient Roman Villa that's been maintained, and occasionally refurbished (with actual windows and the like), since the oldest ancestor of the Greengrass family to live in the Isles (though the surname is a few centuries younger than said ancestor) was granted the plot of land in Roman Britain.
