One of my biggest pet peeves about HP is the lack of friendship between Hermione, Parvati and Lavender. It's definitely something I've made an effort to rectify in my current long fic. It's not central to the plot yet, but I'm toying with the idea that it could be. There's one scene, where I've written a monologue of sorts for Lavender that she delivers to Hermione where I've created some background for her family life, that I'm quite proud of. I can't wait for people to read it!
