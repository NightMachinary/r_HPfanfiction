Ah. The OC does have better social skills than early-canon Hermione, but she still has most of those traits (except for the Emma Watson related one).

In any case, "prejudices" in this case is a mater of being firm in one's ethics, and "ignorance" is natural for a Muggleborn, and room for character development. "Bossiness" is just another word for assertiveness and leadership (though practically never used to describe a man's behaviour---funny that); and outside of bashfic, the things she "nags" about are usually a good idea anyway. Getting rid of those traits sounds like the makings of a profoundly boring and ineffectual character.
