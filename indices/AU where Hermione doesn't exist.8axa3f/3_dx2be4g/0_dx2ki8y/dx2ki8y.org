Not OP, and I love her canon character, but fanfiction tends to twist her into things that she never was. Hermione is neither supposed to be a Wikipedia sex goddess nor a weird rule fetishist past year one. Sadly, those are the two dominant characterisations which you'll find on FFN. She probably wouldn't be the most pleasant person to be around (unless you are into nagging), but a few vocal users here forget her substantial contribution to Harry's success and only see her as a magical Hitler reincarnation eager to suck Dumbledore's dick because she is a good sheep following his vision of the "Greater Good".
