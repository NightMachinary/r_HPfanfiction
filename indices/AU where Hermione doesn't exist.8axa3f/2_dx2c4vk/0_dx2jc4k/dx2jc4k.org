They didn't need Hermione's clue to find the Chamber. If Harry didn't seem to know what the monster was, Tom would probably have tols him in his Evil Monologue.

There's a lot more to consider, though. Why could we guarantee that Ron got bitten by Norberta? Maybe Harry was helping Hagrid that day in this AU, and he was careful enough not to get bitten? Also, what if Hermione stopping Quirrell also stopped him from getting caught? Or what if Snape were just seconds away from breaking the curse?
