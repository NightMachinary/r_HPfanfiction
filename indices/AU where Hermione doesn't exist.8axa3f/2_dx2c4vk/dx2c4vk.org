There's the Unicorn At Hogwarts, but it just puts a different studious socially-awkward bookworm (Twilight Sparkle) in Hermione's place. Plus it never got tremendously far.

--------------

...Now you've asked, though, I wonder, what does happen without Hermione? Aside from Harry & Ron's written homework slipping a bit?

Well, for starters, in the first book, Quirrel probably succeeds in jinxing Harry off his broom in his first Quidditch match. Dumbledore isn't at that match (in the book, anyway), so if Flitwick (local charms master) isn't quick enough to slow Harry's fall or McGonagall doesn't soften the ground in time...splat.

How would the episode with Norbert(a) play out? If Hermione's not there but Ron still gets bitten, will Harry be able to move the crate by himself (with a levitation charm, probably)? Would the detention in the Forbidden Forest still happen?

What about the second book? It's Hermione who manages to put Harry's hearing voices together with all the other clues to figure out the basilisk; are they lost without her? Do things actually go better, with Ron connecting more with Ginny (since Hermione isn't around to draw his attention) and inadvertently helping her fight off the diary? Or does the lack of a muggleborn friend place Harry under more suspicion when he's outed as a Parselmouth?

Hmm, I wonder what else...[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6qebmq/removing_the_weasley_family_from_the_cannon_plot/][there was a question a while back about what would happen if there were no Weasleys, too.]]
