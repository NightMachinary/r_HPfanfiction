I will be the first to admit that I never really cared too much about the holy grail legend, but by the little I know of it (mostly from Indiana Jones and other miscellaneous bits of media) it would guarantee the one who drinks from it immortality, now, translating it into the HP lore (namely that Helga Hufflepuff is dead) it could be that it has an effect similar to drinking unicorn blood, just more benign, it wouldn't be permanent, but by drinking the user could survive whatever is killing them at the moment until the drink leaves their system, though it would be a coin toss if it would heal the damage or just make it so the person survives it.
