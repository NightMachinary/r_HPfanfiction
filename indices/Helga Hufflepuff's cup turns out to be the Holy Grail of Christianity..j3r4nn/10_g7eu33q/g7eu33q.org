  Lucius Malfoy: The Castle Arggh. Our quest is at an end! Dark Lord be praised! Almighty Dark Lord, we thank Thee that Thou hast vouchsafed to us the most holy- [twong baaaa] Merlin's Beard!

  Harry: Hello daffy Death Eaters and Mister Malfoy, who has the brain of a duck, you know! So, we DA fellows out-witted you a second time!

  Lucius: How dare you profane this place with your presence!? I command you, in the name of the Dark Lord Voldemort, to open the doors of this sacred castle, to which he himself has guided us!

  Harry: How you Death Eaters say, I one more time-a unclog my nose in your direction, sons of a window-dresser! So, you think you could out-clever us DA with your silly knees-bent running about in dancing behavior! *I wave my private parts at your Cissy, you cheesy lot of second hand electric donkey bottom biters*.

  Lucius: In the name of our Lord, we demand entrance to this sacred castle!

  Harry: No chance, Death Eater bedwetting types. I burst my pimples at you and call your door opening request a silly thing. You tiny-brained wipers of other people's bottoms!

  Lucius: If you do not open this door, we shall take this castle by force! [shit splats] In the name of our Lord and the glory of our-- [shit splats again] Right! That settles it!

  Harry: Yes, depart a lot at this time and cut the approaching any more or we fire curses at the tops of your heads and make castanets out of your testicles already! Ha ha!

  Lucius: Walk away. Just ignore them.

  Harry: And now remain gone illegitimate faced buggerfolk! And, if you think you got nasty taunting this time, you ain't heard nothing yet! Daffy Death Eaters! Thpppt!
