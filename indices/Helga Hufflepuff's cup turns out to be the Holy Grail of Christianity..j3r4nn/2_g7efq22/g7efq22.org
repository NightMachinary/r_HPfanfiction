Just imagine if this had an abridged series. It would look something like this:

  Ignotus sighed as he sat on the top of the Astronomy Tower, deep in thought. He was considering his new Master -- a young witch who summoned him to the mortal realm once again to fight in the upcoming Holy Grail War.

  He... wasn't sure what to think about her. She had some strange ideas (like suggesting to /carpet bomb Hogsmeade/ to see if any Masters come out), she preferred to call the tournament they were now engaged in “Murder-death-kill”, and then there was her insistence that he was, in fact, some sort of demonic figure from Muggle mythology. On the other hand, after spending a full day with her, he had to begrudgingly accept that Hermione was, in fact, a talented witch.

  “What's your wish, by the way?” he asked the witch, who was now looking over the Forbidden Forest from the edge of the Tower. “I want to double-check that I'm not getting myself involved in anything /ridiculously evil/ right now”

  “Sorry to let you down, but no such luck.” she responded. “I just want the Cup.”

  “You want the Cup?” he asked, surprised. “Just the Grail and not the mana reservoir within?”

  “I just want to stand over the corpses of six fallen heroes drinking butterbeer from a goblet touched by the blood of Christ.” Hermione shrugged. “Teenage girl stuff.”

  ...

  ...

  ...

  “Fuck it, I'm in! I'm all about that zero-accountability life!” Ignotus proclaimed, and then -- for the first time since he arrived in this world -- bowed to Hermione.

  “I humbly swear, my Master, that together you and I are going to /fuck up all the witches/.”
