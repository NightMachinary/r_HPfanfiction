I just realized: she could also summon Diary!Riddle. He's closer to the other interpretation of Satan as the suave tempter who disguises himself as an angel of light.

That's another fic I'd read - I don't think I've ever seen one where Hermione gets the diary. In a close-to-canon universe, it'd work. Horcruxim are secret enough they probably aren't explicitly against any rule, and Tom could easily help her study and even pass on secret insights, so if he plays it the right way he could definitely use her. And without her to figure out the monster is a basilisk, Harry will be in dire straits.
