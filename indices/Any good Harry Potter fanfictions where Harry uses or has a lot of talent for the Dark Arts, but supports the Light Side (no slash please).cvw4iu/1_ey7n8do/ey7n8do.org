linkao3(The Hero With The Hidden Face) [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20119738/chapters/47662957]]

This story along the lines of what you're asking. It's not gotten far yet (only 3 chapters) but it's about a Harry who learns about the Dark Arts early from notes left by his parents as a means of self-preservation, and the struggles he will eventually face balancing his proficiency in them while wanting to do good. It's intriguing! There's promise of in-depth exploration into how certain aspects of the dark arts work and such.
