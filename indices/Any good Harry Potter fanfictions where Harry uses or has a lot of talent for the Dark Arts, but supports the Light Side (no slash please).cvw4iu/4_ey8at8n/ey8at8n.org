First, I want to throw out that there aren't really 'Light Arts' in Harry Potter in the sense that most fantasy settings posit. Rather their is the Dark Arts, which are a malignant thing designed for the most base of human nature, and everything else. Intent matters obviously, but the purpose of the dark arts is almost exclusively to 'harm,' and often functions solely through the most vicious and perverse intents.

Anyway, as for Harry using the Dark Arts, well a lot of fics waffle on this without actually committing to the reality that excessive use is probably associated with character personality (violent person used by people who like violence, etc.). Nevertheless, some examples of Harry using the Dark Arts for the sake of good people:

- linkffn(The Lesser Sadness): hands down one of the best time travel fics that you will read with some truly imaginative dark magic. Short but absolute gold.
- Linkffn(On the Way to Greatness): depicts a believable Slytherin!Harry using whatever means he can to survive, getting particularly vicious by 4th year.
- Linkffn(The Unforgiving Minute): an absolutely brutal display of magic, gore and destruction as Harry speed runs Voldemort's defeat in under 12 hours.
- Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Unlocked Knowledge): a lesser known fic, but has Harry learning from a pseudo!Tom Riddle in his head post OotP. Harry starts really throwing around the dark stuff by chapter 11.
- Linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane): so there is a lot here, but a shorthand is at one point Harry learns how to use a Cannibalism Curse. Yeah, that happens. Best part though? Dumbledore taught it to him.
- Linkffn(The Denarian Renegade): sort of a crossover, but Harry is basically raised as a fire-magic happy arsehole with the barest pretensions to being good.

There's more, but those are certainly standouts.
