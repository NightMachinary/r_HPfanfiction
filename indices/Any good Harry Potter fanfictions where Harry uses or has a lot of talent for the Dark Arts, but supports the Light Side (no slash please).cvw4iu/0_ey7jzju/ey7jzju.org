[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12155794/1/Honour-Thy-Blood][Honour Thy Blood]] comes to mind. It's a canon divergence fic where Arcturus Black survives in hiding, rescues Harry from the graveyard, trains him, and teaches him a blend of Potter and Black family spells. Turns out in this fic that Arcturus and Harry's Grandfather were decorated WWII era vets who fought together on the front line, and as such, a lot of the spells Harry learns are brutal, ruthless, and terrifying if learned by the wrong people.
