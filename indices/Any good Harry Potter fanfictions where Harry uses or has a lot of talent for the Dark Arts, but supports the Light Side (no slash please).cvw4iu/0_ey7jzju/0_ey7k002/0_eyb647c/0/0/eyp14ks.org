ah yeah, oops on that. I don't use reddit that often save for finding out about Fanfiction (pretty much addicted to it. I've read near 250 or so stories)... or if I'm bored.

Well as I said I'll give it a shot. It just takes me a while to read a few chapters of what everyone else is recommending and seeing if I like it or not. So yeah, I've got like 18 tabs open for fanfiction. 2 have not made my interest thus far.
