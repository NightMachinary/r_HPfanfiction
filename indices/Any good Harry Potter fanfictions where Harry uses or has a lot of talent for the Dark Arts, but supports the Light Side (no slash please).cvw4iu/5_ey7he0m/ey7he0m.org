Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux) has a magically talented Harry who works extremely hard to learn both the Dark Arts and more traditional Light magic like the Patronus charm.

He's not exactly a paragon of the Light, but he's also not throwing his lot in with the resurrected Voldemort.
