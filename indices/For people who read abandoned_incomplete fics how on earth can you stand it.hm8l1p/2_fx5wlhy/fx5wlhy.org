I enjoy good writing, whether it's complete or not. Witty banter and exciting duels are enjoyable for their own sake, and don't have to be part of a whole.

Fics with really interesting overall plots that seem to need completion, I just consider as extended prompts. They're interesting setups I can continue with my own imagination.

And of course, there's nothing quite like the thrill of subscribing to something that seems abandoned, then getting a surprise update years later. That's way more fun than just getting the whole story at once. Although sometimes when I get the writer's version of the ending, I'm a little disappointed since it doesn't seem as good as the one I was imagining.
