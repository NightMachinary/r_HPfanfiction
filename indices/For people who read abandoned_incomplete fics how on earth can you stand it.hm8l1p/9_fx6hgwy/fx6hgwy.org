It's like death. I always remember that God's question from “Joan of Arcadia”: “Would you rather [boy's name] was never born? Aren't you thankful for all those moments you could spent with him, even when you couldn't spend more of them?”. It is the same.

And when the pain is too big, I write a sequel. ;)
