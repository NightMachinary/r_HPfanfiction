I very rarely am reading a fanfic for the /plot/, whether the fic is complete or incomplete. Even complete fics rarely have satisfying endings, because endings are probably the hardest thing to write well. To be blunt, fanfic writers aren't great at plot/conflict. If I want that, I'll go read Brandon Sanderson.

I read fanfic for the sandbox element. So long as a fic contains something of /substance/, it rarely matters to me that the story it is telling is incomplete. That substance can be worldbuilding, interesting character interactions, "fixing" canon, etc. It doesn't have to be plot.
