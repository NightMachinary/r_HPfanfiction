  There are lots of way to abandon a fic, and I hold up linkffn(Three Black Birds) as my favorite abandoned fic, not only for the quality of the fic itself but also because the author posted the outline when they abandoned it, so it helps with the whole “unresolved ending” thing.

My favorite author did this for his fanfic series too, for Kingdom Hearts.

While I wish he could have finished it, I am still quite satisfied by what he envisioned.
