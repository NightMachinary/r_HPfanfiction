It depends on the fic of course. There are lots of way to abandon a fic, and I hold up linkffn(Three Black Birds) as my favorite abandoned fic, not only for the quality of the fic itself but also because the author posted the outline when they abandoned it, so it helps with the whole “unresolved ending” thing.

I'll also echo other responders on both sometimes there are truly amazing fics that are abandoned, and if you read enough fanfic, at some point I'd rather read unfinished fics I love than completed works that are barely worth the time. And some of them might get finished eventually, who knows?
