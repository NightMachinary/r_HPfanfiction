For me it's about new ideas. The search for something a little bit different over-weighs the frustration of incomplete stories. Also, sometimes even when the full story isn't finished, a key aspect of it is resolved and that can be satisfaction enough to override the disappointment (e.g. Sirius being proven innocent or that moment when characters get together after a slow burn build up).

I do have some criteria, to make sure there is enough content to be worth it. Not just a word count but the word/chapter ratio. I wont ready anything that is under 1000 words per chapter but for something WIP I look for a minimum 20,000 words posted with approx 3,000 words per chapter. I also only start WIP stories that were updated within the last 12 months (gotta have some hope that it'll continue) and if it's older and abandoned I want at least 80,000 words, though over 100k is better.
