As everyone else who has commented so far has pretty much said, good writing is good writing, whether or not the story is complete, and I can always have fun trying to imagine where the story is going next.

One reason I don't avoid stories that aren't marked complete is that I've also found that the "complete" tag or its lack is not always a reliable indicator. Some authors mark a story as complete when they decide they're not going to write any more of this story, whether it's at a logical stopping point for a story arc or not. That's frustrating, because an abrupt stop makes it feel like they've lied to me, or cheated me out of something. (I know, free ice cream, but ...)

Other authors don't mark as complete stories that they /do/ stop at the logical end of an arc. Even if the author originally intended there to be more to the story, it feels satisfyingly complete to me.

The only incomplete/abandoned stories that really bother me are the ones that can barely be described as a start. It's a matter of effort required on my part compared to the return, really. Sort of like if the first book had ended when Hagrid said, "Harry, yer a wizard." At that point, you don't have a story, and you don't have a plot, and I don't have a reason to want to continue unless it's a new story. If it hasn't been updated in several years, I'll be sorry I wasted the time reading that much. Given that I enjoy one-shots and stories that are complete in less than epic length, sometimes I end up wasting the time.

That said, one thing I've seen done (/very/ rarely) that I like is a final chapter in which the author says, "I'm never going to finish this story because reasons. Here's where I was planning to go with it ..."
