The one nice thing about the quarantine was that a handful of fics that I considered in "abandoned territory" (more than 2 years since last updated) were updated by the author. So there always is a sliver of hope that the story will eventually be updated.

Does it drive me a little crazy that the story "stops" before it hits the end absolutely. But I still enjoyed what I read until that point. And like some other readers I can imagine where I want the story to go.
