Some of the best fics I've read happen to be unfinished. As the other commenter said, I even re-read them periodically. Part of that is to enjoy the writing that captivated me the first time. Life is a journey, not a destination. Yes, it's disheartening and frustrating when the story ends abruptly, even the ones that end at a good stopping point.

But I am also an optimist. At least two of the unfinished fics in my collection have started having new chapters after literally years. Never say never.

That said, if a fic is clearly labeled as abandoned, I will not start reading it. What I hate the most are authors who abandon their work but, instead of saying so, mark it complete. There's a special hell reserved for them.
