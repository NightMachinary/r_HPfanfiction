There are a lot, so I'll name the only one that I read any of, which is Arithmancer. It's Hermione-centered (she is a math whiz), but follows the usual cast through Hogwarts with Harry doing about the same stuff, with Hermione having a much bigger part. The first volume is 3 or 4 years, the second volume "Lady Archimedes" is (I think) the rest, and then there's what I believe is a post-graduation sequel called "Annals of Arithmancy". I've only read the first volume. It might be the kind of thing you're looking for. I had mixed feelings. It's an engaging read but I felt that once the main idea had played out, continuing was just more of the same.
