Post Final Battle Sacrifice. Harry wakes up as kid/baby Dudley. Snape wakes up as kid/baby Harry. Harry isn't quite all there. Think along the lines of Luna Lovegood. Now /Harry/ has to make sure Harry doesn't die prematurely. Both of them. And deal with /himself/.

Did that make sense? Good, because I read the fic and I still don't understand that sentence I typed.
