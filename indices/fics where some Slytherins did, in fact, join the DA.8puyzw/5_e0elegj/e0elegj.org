It keeps with canon, so they don't join the DA but it's all about Slytherins and a lot of them are fighting back against Voldemort (creating their own groups-but it's a series so it's a bit later on). My favourite aspect is actually the implication that one of the members of the Slytherin Quidditch team is actually really good friends with Ginny.
