What are you basing that conclusion on? The actions of maybe 20-30 people? There's a scale, and a large difference between not being fond of muggle-borns and going on active killing sprees. The sample size isn't nearly large enough to make that conclusion, and there are plenty of awful people from other houses. Pettigrew was a Gryffindor, Lockhart was a Ravenclaw, etc.
