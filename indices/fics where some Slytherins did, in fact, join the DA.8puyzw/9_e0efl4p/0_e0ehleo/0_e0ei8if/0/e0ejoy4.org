Partly the name, but it's also canon that Daphne has a younger sister who ends up marrying Draco. It's a detail that makes her slightly more interesting. A couple early H/D fics also created fanon's Ice Queen Daphne, which really popularized her as a character and the pairing by extension imo. A few small factors can really snowball.
