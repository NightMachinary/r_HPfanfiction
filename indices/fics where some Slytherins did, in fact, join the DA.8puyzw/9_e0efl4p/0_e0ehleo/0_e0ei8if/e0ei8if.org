Harry/Tracey (not Harry/Tonks). Its less common by far than the Harry/Daphne pairing, which I suspect is almost entirely due to the name "Daphne" being more appealing than the name "Tracey" (stereotypes am I right?). If you want some examples, try James Spookie and his various fics with Daphne. Any fic where Harry dates or becomes more tolerant of Slytherins will probably involve them joining the DA (this an old axiom too, fics as old as Taking Control have touched on this as well.).
