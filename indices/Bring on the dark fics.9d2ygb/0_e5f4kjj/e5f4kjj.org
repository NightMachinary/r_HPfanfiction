[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9095016/1/Betrayal][Betrayal]], linkffn(9095016): Both Ron and Hermione left Harry behind, so he had to carry on the fight alone. One of my favorite Harry/Daphne.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/Broken-Chains][Broken Chains]] and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12040341/1/The-Stars-Alone][The Stars Alone]], linkffn(12040341;7718942): The first one is a Star Wars crossover, the second one Stargate. The stakes went from Magical Britain to the Earth and finally to the Galaxy . The bad guys in "The Stars Alone" made Voldemort appear benign and positively enlightened. Hermione and Luna have done tons of shit in this series.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4586362/1/Dark-Marauder][Dark Marauder]], linkffn(4586362): James survived, and Marauders went on a rampage.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994): I'm not 100% sure it's a dark fic, but there are many very disturbing scenes. The final battle (not against Voldemort) is totally awesome though.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4889913/1/Hallows-and-Pathos][Hallows and Pathos]], linkffn(4889913): Hermione got away too lightly here IMO.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2705927/1/Imprisoned-Realm][Imprisoned Realm]], linkffn(2705927): Its author spent 12 years writing this very dark dimensional travel.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9561455/1/Spectrum][Spectrum]], linkffn(9561455): Basically an one-shot, but it's the only time travel in which Hermione killed young Tom Riddle in the orphanage instead of raising or shagging him. She didn't stop here though.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925): Harry and Hermione had suffered horribly in this one.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11564067/1/The-Last-Enemy][The Last Enemy]], linkffn(11564067): One shot, Harry became a serial killer in search for immortality.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7135971/1/The-Voyage-of-the-Starship-Hedwig][The Voyage of Starship Hedwig]], linkffn(7135971): They almost went extinct, and yet they made it to another planet far away from the Earth. But Their troubles were far from over. Still the best 'Wizard in Space' fic despite many shortcomings.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4464089/1/Yellow-Submarine][Yellow Submarine]], linkffn(4464089): Very disturbing
