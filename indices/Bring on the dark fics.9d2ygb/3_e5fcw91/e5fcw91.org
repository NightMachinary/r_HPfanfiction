Linkffn(The Prisoners Cipher): Harry was a cackling maniac in the vein of Dr. No or Goldfinger with superpowers

Linkffn(Antithesis): A recent WBWL story

Linkffn(The Unforgiving Minute): One of the most brutal fics you can read with an actual story, Harry did not mess around here.

Linkffn(The Bonds of Blood): the darkest, most screwed up iteration of a soul-bond story I have ever read, but one that has always been more like what I would see happening from a soul-bond if it were real.

Linkffn(The Lesser Sadness): you know all those time travel stories where death or fate or something like that sends Harry back to change the future? How about if it was someone much worse sending Harry back.

Linkffn(The Lies that Bind): the beginning is banal and then takes a hard turn into insane viciousness that will give you whiplash.

Linkffn(On the way to Greatness): one of the most realistic portrayals of Harry got sorted into Slytherin out there (basically, being in Slytherin sucks).

Linkffn(Unatoned): murder-mystery style story with Harry/Daphne
