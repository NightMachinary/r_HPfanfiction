Yeah, in canon his angry outbursts are more on the order of "why is everyone keeping me in the dark? why do so many people think I'm lying? why are there so many things I'm powerless to do anything about? also I can barely get proper sleep and I have unresolved trauma from last year" which is understandable though it might be annoying to read. In my experience most fanfic authors don't know how to strike that balance at all.
