After doing a bit of digging, some magical families that are Pureblood may have originally claimed to be "descended from the gods". i.e., the surname "Gaunt" originally meant "of Gontia", and Gontia is an ancient Celtic goddess. So, too, is Morrigan, an ancient Irish deity whom the Sayres (another Pureblood family) claimed descent from.

As such, the Blacks, being Pureblood, and likely related to both the Sayre and Gaunt families at some point in the past, could always start naming new kids after the gods / goddesses from which they claimed descent from. One Sayre descendant (Isolt Sayre) even renamed / called herself "Morrigan", after her supposed goddess ancestor.
