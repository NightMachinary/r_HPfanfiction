Even the Malfoys are known to re-use names, with Lucius being the main one being re-used. Sort of like how some men are "John Smith the 13th". Seeing as how they are French in origin, it always surprised me how they did not use more French names, and instead, used mainly Latin ones. Heck, the Weasleys have more French names now, due to Bill marrying Fleur, with their descendants than the Malfoys do (Victoire, Louis, Dominique).
