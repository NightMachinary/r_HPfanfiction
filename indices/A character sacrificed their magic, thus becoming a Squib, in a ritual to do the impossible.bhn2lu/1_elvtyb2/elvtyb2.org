So ive been off the sub for like a year now. I don't remember seeing so many prompt posts back then im assuming they are something new? or is my memory just shit?

Either way, i know this is not exactly what you are looking for as its not something im writing but i remember reading a fic from the old days with harry doing a spell to take the cancer away from the father of a muggle family that he was good friends with. In the story wizards cannot get cancer or cure it but they can transfer it once, so harry is not stuck with terminal cancer.

The story was not super amazing by todays standards but i remember having good feelings back then.
