Well, I suppose it would depend on what the shield was made up of. From what I recall of Shield Charms, they're invisible, so maybe they're made up of some sort of energy which has no actual physical substance once dispersed? I can see destroying a Shield Charm in a forceful manner causing a concussive wave, tho. Something is there, occupying space and then suddenly it's not, so air rushes in to fill the space, generating the wave. Or, something was there and then is blasted to bits and the residual force of the blast causes the concussive wave. Hard to say since magical Shields are poorly defined in canon.
