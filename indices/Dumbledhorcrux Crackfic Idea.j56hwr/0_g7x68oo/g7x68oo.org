It's much more likely that the Resurrection Stone or the snitch that contained it was Dumbledore's horcrux. That's why he met Harry in Limbo. Where he went on to overcome his spirit and possess his body, banter with Voldemort like to a young student, call him Tom, offer him a chance at redemption, etc later even give "Harry's" son an atrocious name like Albus Severus.
