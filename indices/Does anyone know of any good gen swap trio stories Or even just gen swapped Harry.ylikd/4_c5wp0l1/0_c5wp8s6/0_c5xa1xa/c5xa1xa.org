Femmeslash and slash fics get a bad rap because most of the people writing and reading it are more interested in the sex than the story. But it can be good on occasion. Butterfly Effect is a good example. It has some sexy bits, which I'm not really a fan of, but it also has a fantastic plot and absolutely BRILLIANT characterizations.
