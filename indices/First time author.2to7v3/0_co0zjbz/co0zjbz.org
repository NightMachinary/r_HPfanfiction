Full disclosure - I have basically zero interest in reading a Hermione/Draco story. From my perspective, to make it work at all, you have to change the basic characteristics of their canon selves to a degree where I'd just assume read about two random OCs.

That being said, since you're giving it the old college try, and that's commendable, I did poke around your first chapter. You've got a couple basic red flags here:

Error in the first sentence; should be "Hogwarts Express," not "Hogwarts express." A minor thing, in the end, but to have a blemish in your very first sentence doesn't inspire confidence that this will be a fic with a high degree of polish or attention to detail.

Denoting POV: To step outside the narrative and tell us the POV character of each section is sloppy writing. If we can't tell whose head we're in from the writing, you have bigger problems, and if we can, it's redundant.

Short chapter: 1,000 words is not long enough to sink into. It's barely enough to be a teaser. I could live with this, if you did something in those 1,000 words that was blindingly fresh or tense or captivating, but...

All exposition: Your first chapter is like a first date - you need to put some real effort into putting your best foot forward. Introduce tension, conflict, newness. It should be plotted and paced within an inch of its life. Instead, this is classic 10th date, stay-at-home-with-Netflix-and-sweat-pants stuff. Nothing inherently wrong with it - a chapter of atmosphere and introspection can work as an interlude, for example - but you're not showing any leg, which means you're not doing a great job hooking me.

Show vs. tell: Another basic thing - okay, so they're meeting on a train, the war is over, they're going back to school, etc. You get a lot more conflict and tension and character development and all that good stuff out of presenting this kind of information as dialogue and action, rather than internal musing.

If you have Hermione think to herself, "the war was over and she had never felt happier to be alive," then you're just telling me she feels a certain way, and you lose.

If you can show me Hermione acting in a certain way, saying something to someone, injecting the pure, raw /feeling/ of what it means to come through a brutal war and be gloriously /alive/, and make me, as a reader, feel that on her behalf because I'm so viscerally right there with her and inside her head, then you win.
