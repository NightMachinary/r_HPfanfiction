To answer your questions I'm going to give you a couple of spoilers. First of all I'm going to deal with them hating each other by forcing them to live together. I was thinking to have them both named as head girl/boy and then make them live in the same dorm for their position. Then Hermione will attempt to be more open minded, and Draco having changed after the war will be more empathetic as well.

To deal with Ron, I think I'll just have him get jealous at Draco for spending so much time with Hermione. Then Hermione will finally realize his "idiotic" nature and kind of blow him off.

If you have any more questions Id love to answer them!
