/Ugh/

I just skimmed thought it it seems decently well written, But I'll wait until you have more written to give you an opinion.

Edit: Just to say that, I don't like Hr/D because it's maybe one of the most unrealistic pairings in the fandom (after Voldemort/Anyone, Snape/Harry, Snape/Hermione). I understand the appeal of Nerdy girl x Bad boy but after all that happens in canon and how Draco treats Hermione (and Draco Values) I can't see a way for them to start a relation ship.

Also, there is Ron who people just hate for whatever reason so he ends up being bashed or becoming some kind of rapist caricature, although in canon Hermione was headsoverheels for him. people just tend to handwave all the develpemnt from canon.

I want to read a good, realistic, well written D/Hr, and i would like to think that your fic would be the one but on the other hand I don't want to be disapointed.

So in conclusion let me ask you a few questions.

You say this story is D/Hr. how will you handle the fact that Hermione hates Draco and Draco hates Hermione?, How will you handle that after DH Ron and Hermione are an Item?, How will you handle Ron?
