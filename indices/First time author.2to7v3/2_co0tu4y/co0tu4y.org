Very interesting first chapter! You really made me curious about the story and so I kept reading :)

There were some redundant words here and there, and more sentence length variety would be awesome.

I loved how you put little snippets of detail here and there to really bring life to the scenes. Also, the subtle tone of each character's perspective was really nice.

Hope to see more chapters!
