Damn, I jumped ship on that fic when Hermione was killed off-screen in the second chapter, but it sounds like I need to muscle through it for sheer ridiculousness. That author's note on the latest chapter is giving me Perfect Lionheart and "Partially Kissed Hero" vibes. I love how ridiculous PKH is, it sounds like this might become another of my "So Bad it's Funny" collection.
