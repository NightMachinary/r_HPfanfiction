Haha, i am Communist! how совпадающий . Buddy, i'm one for ending oppression. Listen, I don't want this to go onto a all night long argument of philosophy , so I'll keep this short, Say... you run an online forum, and some lad comes along and start advocating Nazism, and putting swastikas all over a forum page. He is oppressing the right to freedom, He is probably an anti-semanticist, as well. You, being the owner of the forum, ban/whatever to this person, yes? This, Nazi is advocating Hate Speech against a peoples. Would you say it was wrong, then, to suppress someone's views? Look, Fanfiction, is a company, they have their own site, their own whatever. What I'm saying, is that NoodleHammer's hate reflects badly on them. imagine main stream media found out, that on a site with a large community, in the upper tier of the favorites section, that there was an author advocating Islamophobia in a story favorited by many people? Fanfiction, like PewDiePie was branded as a Nazi, would be branded as a Islamophobic site. I don't want that to happen to [[https://FFN.net][FFN.net]], i read most of my fics there. It is in the best interests of Fanfiction, and the Fanfiction Readers to have this literature removed.

Look, I'm sorry if people got upset by my first comment, okay? But it should be removed, ASAP, for the future of Harry Potter Fanfiction, and other fanfics.

Thank you, and до свидания
