Yeah! Censure and silencing always work!

This is speech against people who drive trucks into crowds and those indoctrinating their families into viewing that as acceptable. Not at all innocent. Very guilty, actually. The fact that nearly all of them are Muslim is just that --- a fact. I mean, has anyone ever driven a truck into a crowd of people, killing dozens, while shouting "Hallelujah"?

Now, where the author goes with it is strange at best and inefficient at worst. Many better ways in which a powerful wizard could steer a religion into a more civil place besides mass killings.
