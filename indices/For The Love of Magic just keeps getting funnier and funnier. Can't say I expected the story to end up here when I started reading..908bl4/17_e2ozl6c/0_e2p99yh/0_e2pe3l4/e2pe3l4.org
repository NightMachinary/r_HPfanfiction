  I mean, has anyone ever driven a truck into a crowd of people, killing dozens, while shouting "Hallelujah"?

Not that I'm aware of, but there was this whole thing with crusades awhile back that was pretty shitty. Not sure if you've heard of those.

But there's plenty of Muslims that /aren't/ radical- peaceful people that just follow a religion. Some of the people in that religion decided to make it a reason to murder people and spread fear.
