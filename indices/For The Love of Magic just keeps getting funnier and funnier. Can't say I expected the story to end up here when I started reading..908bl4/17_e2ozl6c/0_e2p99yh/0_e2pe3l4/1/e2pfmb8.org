I think if you want to portray Christianity as something bad, you're better off using paedophile/rapist priests as an example. The crusades are ancient history. Everyone did things that are abhorrent by today's standards back then --- if you didn't, you were conquered.

I'm not sure what you're disagreeing with. My point was that mass killings are no way of dealing with radical extremists --- especially if you have magic powers.
