I did not even know that the post existed. 260 comment, this story just gets so much attention :D. The quotes seem interesting. To me he is just a person that maybe got a bad experience with Muslims, got radicalized on the internet at some point by half-truths and alternative facts. Some points is his Islam rant paragraphs are atleast some part truthfull but then it goes to the rabbit hole. It sad because this seem like a prime example of what happens to the modern generation. They get desinformed and become super-leftwing or alt-right and put it is everything. They can't become friends with someone of other political orientation because of the intake of hate and information they get daily. It is just dissapionting.
