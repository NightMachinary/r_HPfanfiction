I enjoyed it quite a bit on my first read-through, the chapters written back then weren't as infected by the spirit of the time.

Sigh. And here I was waiting for it to get finished to have myself some more HP smutty goodness.

Although I haven't read the more recent chapters, so I have no idea what's going on with the story. So can't judge your quoted fragment either. Will see, I guess.
