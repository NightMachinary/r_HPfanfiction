Honestly? Because watching a mediocre fic turn into borderline neo-Nazi propaganda is funny. The actual content is just disgusting but the concept of some silly harem story turning into this in the space of about a chapter and a half? That's pretty damn funny to me if only for it's absurdity. Maybe I'm a little inured (I think that's the right word) to it by the constant mayocide jokes over on [[/r/drama]] but yeah. I thought it was kinda funny to have some harem story suddenly turn into a self-insert's genocidal fantasy.

Edit: maybe it's the whole irony of him being a shut-in with no social life and claiming that it's everyone else who's wrong about Muslims and the political state of Europe and the Middle East in the middle of some fantasy about him having magical powers and a harem? Idk. I'll let you know when I've figured it out.
