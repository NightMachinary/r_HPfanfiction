  It looks to me like an author taking Harry through the process of radicalization.

I think it's more likely we're following the author through his own and it's just showing in his characters. I thought the same as you during that first controversial chapter but the author's rants at the top of the chapter have convinced me otherwise. Though the fic is definitely a few steps up in complexity and length from the other stuff the he's written I don't think he's the kind of writer who'd go for something so complex. It would definitely be really cool though.
