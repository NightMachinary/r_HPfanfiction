It looks to me like an author taking Harry through the process of radicalization.

Harry is forced into hardship at a young age retarding healthy mental development. As a young person he becomes used to taking real world actions that have devastating consequences for the people he considers his enemies. He develops strong personal beliefs.

He's a person who was socialized badly in their youth and "might makes right" has been mentally ingrained into his thought processes whether or not he realizes it. He's used to taking direct action to fix what he perceives as a problem.

In the past this hasn't been an issue because the people he's had a problem with were obviously bad people. But now this major religion runs against his strong personal beliefs and he has the power to do something about that. Then he does.

He's an evil dickhead but from his point of view it's both logical and reasonable.

It would be kind of cool if Harry one day finds that he's become Voldemort and a prophesied savior is born to save people from him.
