The thing is, if a powerful wizard wanted to reform a religion, they could easily spend a few months, tops, to use the false memory charm to turn the most prominent and influential religious leaders around. You can dress it up as them having visions from god. No need for any pogroms or killings - just have influential people pass out decrees reforming the religion. Then spend a few years treating replacement leaders who try to form a backlash with the same spell until it sinks in. If needed, add some "Miracles" for the most stubborn opponents. Religious fanatics are really easy to manipulate if you can do magic.
