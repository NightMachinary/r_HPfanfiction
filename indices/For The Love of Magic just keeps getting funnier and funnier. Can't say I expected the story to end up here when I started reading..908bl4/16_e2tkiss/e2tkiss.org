Holy shit...... So glad I stopped reading the moment I saw hints of a harem. I checked out his author's notes on the chapter you linked and the last one and it's really fucked up. He has no understanding of history and it seems we're just getting a look into the author's unfiltered thoughts rather than Harry's.

A few quotes from his A/N that stood out for me (if you don't want to read through that garbage) -

From the "Guest review section" in chapter 53:

#+begin_quote
  *B. Netanyahu -- hate to break it to you, but Harry only despises Jews less than Muslims because they don't make as much noise.*
#+end_quote

Chapter 53 author's note:

#+begin_quote
  *You can wail about it all you want, but places like Africa and the Middle East are not exactly beacons of enlightenment these days. The backstories don't matter. Even if we humor the delusions some of you have and say that it's all the fault of the evil Europeans and USA and that those places would be utopias otherwise, Harry just doesn't* */care/*. He would sneer at a slave for not casting off their own chains or die trying.

  *Yes, I obviously hold some variation of these beliefs myself. Congratulations, you've discovered the concept of author bias. What an earth-shattering revelation. The very fabric of reality echoes with shock at the thought of an author whose writing is influenced by his personal opinions, especially on a hobby website.*

I've read some really, really dumb stuff on this site from stories with terrible English to Mary sues to Dark_Harry.exe to mpreg. And some of the authors had equally dumb rationale for the shit they wrote. But I've never come across an author's note as toxic as this...
