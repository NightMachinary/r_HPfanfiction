Maybe, but I think there's still a bit of a difference between a regular psychopath who just doesn't value any human life at all and an ideologically/politically motivated narcissist who murders subhumans.

At least in the usual evil!Harry fics he leans more towards the insane dude out for blood who needs to take revenge on all who wronged him.
