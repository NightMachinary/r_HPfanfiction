Those are the people that read the fix for what it is. A Harry that is a really egotistical and enforces his radically rational and quite bigoted beliefs. To me the story just made poeple express very funny and different opinions on the political parts of the story. To me it is the what the author always did, I read his Naruto fic an the base idea was quite similar. I have no problem with the story like every other one. It is just an extension of the authors opinions and ideas. And some people still like it.
