Weird thing is this guy has a history of doing this, he has a series of 4 stories that are very similar in tone to this one and they are all fairly strange. I think it was the third story of that series there was a bunch of omakes where he starting mocking religions, which he then put in as fully fleshed chapters in the fourth story. He was no less blatantly condescending than he is in this story, so I very much doubt he will give a single shit about all the gibbering people are doing, regardless if it is well deserved or not. Every single one of his stories are basically porn of varying degrees of quality as the main character ascends to ludicrous power levels and curb stomps various analogies of people/characters that the author doesn't like, the only people that would consider this one of his stories going sideways are those that haven't read any of his others.
