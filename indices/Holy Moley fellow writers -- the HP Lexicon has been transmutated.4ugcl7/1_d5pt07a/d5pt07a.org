I literally said "Holy shit" aloud at seeing this. I thought the site was dead as far as updates were concerned and it's looked the same for as long as I've been using it. Definitely a shock to see it so different.

I like the design, but I'm not thrilled about the new pages. Main example: the characters page. Before, you could pick a letter and see all characters of that letter, whereas now there's just 44 pages and a guess at where any one letter begins--awkward when you're looking for a certain character. There were also options to see all the members of a group (death eaters, students, teachers, etc) and that doesn't seem to be a possibility anymore, except by finding the page about that specific group. You also need to go back to the home page to see the main explore menus again (the dropdown in the topbar doesn't include them), which is annoying. ([[http://i.imgur.com/CTm3juO.jpg][Old Character Page]] vs. [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/character/][New Character Page]])

Opinion might change as I get used to it, but for now I'm on the fence about this makeover.

*Edit:* Also, I just found [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/event/amarillo-lestoat-dies/][this]] and I'm thinking JKR is not an Anne Rice fan:
