I noticed this a day or two ago. I use this site pretty much every day as it has the best compilation of information, but I'm struggling to use the new site. Like, on the old one when searching characters, you could just go to the characters main page and click on an letter and it would list all the people with that first letter in their name. But, you can't do that on a new one, instead, it just lists them all with 40+ pages, or you have to use the search bar for example "Shacklebolt" , but the results it shows are not intuitive.
