The HP Lexicon has been around for a long time - well before the wikia and it has always tried to adhere to book canon, separating that from what was changed for the movies or added by video games.

It appears that they've gone through a site redesign, and one that evokes a little of the current Pottermore style, if in a better way. More graphics, better link-backs and the option for each article to have its own comment section.

Of particular interest to me was this commentary for the article on Sybill Trelawney:

  Rowling's version was Sybill. In ancient times a Sibyl was a prophetess who, in a state of ecstasy and under influence of Apollo, prophesied without being consulted. So Rowling intentionally decided NOT to follow the spelling of the ancient seer because her character is more of a “wanna-be” seer. The US editors changed it, though, presumably because they wanted the name to fit the spelling of the ancient prophetesses.

  So does that strike anyone else as oddly as it does me? Why were the US editors allowed to change something like that? This was a specific, intentional artistic choice by Rowling. This is the kind of thing which makes Rowling's writing as rich and interesting as it is. But she let them change things. It's either that the US editors were too pushy or that Rowling was too easily pushed. While it's probably a combination of both, I think this is a clear example of how Rowling works with other creatives. And it's an important concept for fans to understand.

  Rowling does not look at canon the way we do. She doesn't come at things with the idea that she has the last word or that everything has to be the way she conceived it. She has no problem with changes to her world instigated by others. Not just any “others, of course, just certain ones, like the book editors and the film makers. This explains why she didn't step in and correct so many things in the films, such as the pronunciation of the name “Voldemort.” She's more than happy to be a team player and just go with it. Let them do their creative thing. Unfortunately, the literature, the depth, the richness is sacrificed.
