As do I. I'm certainly willing to give them a probationary thumbs up so long as their opinions don't intrude into the bare bones encyclopaedia. I couldn't find the section wordhammer linked on Sybill's article page.

The Lexicon has always had essays on shipping (many of them shockingly stupid), but they were never anywhere near the articles for the characters themselves. So long as that remains the case I don't really see how this iteration is different than the last.
