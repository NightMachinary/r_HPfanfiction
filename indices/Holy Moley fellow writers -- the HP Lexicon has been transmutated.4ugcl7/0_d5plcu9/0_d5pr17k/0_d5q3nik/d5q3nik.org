Well said, but the Lexicon mostly does a good job of separating their editorial stances from the bare facts of the series. Authors for HP fanfic really don't have many online resources to help check facts and keep their characters consistent.

The largest - and perhaps most frequently used - resource is probably the HP Wiki. Despite providing no sources whatsoever, their [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Draco_Malfoy][article for Draco Malfoy]] furthers the Felton Fans' agenda who insist that Draco must be 'clever:'

This is absurd.

The [[https://legacy.hp-lexicon.org/wizards/draco.html][Lexicon's article]] limits itself to /sourced/ data for both their extensive biographical section and brief profile.

While I don't think the Lexicon can publish biased essays like the one wordhammer mentions and claim to be a neutral authority, for the moment they're still the best resource.
