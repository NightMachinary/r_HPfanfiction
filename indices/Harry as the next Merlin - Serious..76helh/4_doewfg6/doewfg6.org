Semprini's has a series where by the end Harry has discovered a whole new way of doing magic, essentially reaches enlightenment, revolutionizes the way wizards are taught magic, and is absolutely considered the Merlin of his time. I enjoyed it a lot, and thought the author did a good job of making Harry's progress believable. it was written pre-HBP so is not canon compliant with anything past OotP.
