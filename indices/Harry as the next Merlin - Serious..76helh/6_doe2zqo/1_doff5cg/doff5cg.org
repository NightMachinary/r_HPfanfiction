This fic gets recommended all the time, but it's the only one at the top of the favorites lineup on ffn that I haven't read. I just can't get past the writing. The plot must be amazing for it to have so many likes because the moment to moment is... not great. Every now and then I'll try again because I feel like I should, but I've never made it past the second chapter.
