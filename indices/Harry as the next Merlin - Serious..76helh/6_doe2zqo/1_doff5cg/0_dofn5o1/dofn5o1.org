I read it, mostly because I thought the emphasis on runes was interesting like how in The Name of The Wind, Kvothe is an Artificer which is kinda the same and that was pretty interesting.

I don't think it's very good, I'd call it average on all counts, but somehow everyone still recommends it. If I had to guess, it's because some of the way magic is described is much better than in canon. There's more too it than the "swish and flick", also that it's kinda a wish fulfillment story where Harry gets sort of OP.

All in all, it's not worth reading if you're hoping to find anything unique, but that doesn't make it terrible. It has Harry/Luna which I was excited about since that is never a pairing that happens, but Luna in this story could be substituted for anybody else. I think Luna is hard to write well if she is more than a side characters, and in this she is #2 to Harry and she doesn't sound like Luna at all. It has a whole "masked vigilante kills death eaters" thing, and it's one of the worse ones that I've read. I don't really remember the overall writing quality, but I don't remember it being great; dialogue was passable, plot was passable, I don't think I've ever heard anyone claim it was amazing.
