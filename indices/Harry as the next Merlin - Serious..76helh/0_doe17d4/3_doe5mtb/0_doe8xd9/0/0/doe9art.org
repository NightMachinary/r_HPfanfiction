Most of the fem!Harry stories deal (almost) exclusively with the fact that "omg Harry is a girl", and how this would change things.

In ALJH we have a Harry who happens to be a girl. It's the difference between a Fic that was written around a pairing, and a fic that happens to have a specfic pairing down the line. Sure, it influences the plot, but it's not like the whole world wraps around that.
