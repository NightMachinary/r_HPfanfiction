  Dumbledore's chess pawn

This phrase drives me crazy. It so overused it's become a cliche all of it's own and it makes me not want to read the stories that contain it! Stories with Manipulative Dumbledore smack of paranoia and being written by people who secretly smoke to defy their parents and teachers with a "that will show 'em" attitude.
