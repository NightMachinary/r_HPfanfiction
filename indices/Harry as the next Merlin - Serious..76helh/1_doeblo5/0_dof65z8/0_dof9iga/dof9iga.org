That is true.but you have to say this is better than most fics. At least this shows how Harry got strong rather than:

“You are my heir, Harry” said Myrddin

“I am also the heir of 50 different founders and important figures”

“I have deemed you worthy. Here you go have my powers” blesses Merlin.

I liked the story the best whenever it was in the past and not the present. Even then I felt that the founders arc was the best.
