Yeah sorta. I guess it is kinda annoying that he encounters every famous historical wizard and that they all want Harry to be able to use their magic. But it doesn't really do anything too bad to detract from the story IMO, it's tedious sometimes because there really isn't much of a point as far as I can see. Even before they all start doing it, he's already one of the very best and certainly the most knowledgeable wizards in the world; it doesn't really make sense why he agrees to all that other than to kill time and to learn something new, which sort of makes sense in universe, but like I said it does get tedious to read.

But my main point is that all that nonsense isn't really a bunch of wish fulfillment stuff and that it doesn't make him OP.
