Personally, I enjoy infinite loop style fanfics: [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/TheInfiniteLoops]] While the Harry Potter universe is looping, I don't know of a compilation of all of the Harry Potter loops, most unfortunately. I find crossover content keeps the loops fresh, rather than the groundhog day style stories that restrict themselves to one particular universe exclusively.
