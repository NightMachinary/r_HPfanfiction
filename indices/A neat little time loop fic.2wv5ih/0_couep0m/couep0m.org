Sisyphus is one of my favorites. It's written with a kind of dry, wry menace that's very hard to pull off, and executed well here. So many great lines, like:

#+begin_quote
  There's no adventure to find who and what Sirius was to him, of course, as he already knows... and as he has no one to have adventures with.
#+end_quote

Also some great meta-commentary on the life cycle of a reader of fanfiction:

#+begin_quote
  He's spent time with Sirius now, asked millions of questions and gotten the same answers - a life where Sirius lives has lost its shine. He's saved Cedric dozens of times and watched him be killed equally as many times, and can't quite figure out what difference it makes if he lives or if he dies. His friendships with Hermione and Ron had been lived through so many times, that he no longer wants to remake them - after all the lives, he hasn't only gotten bored with his friends, but sick of them. He's replaced them many times with all sorts of people, with Neville and Luna and Dean and Seamus and Terry and Susan and Lavender and Padma and Parvati, even Draco and Daphne and Pansy and Gregory and Vincent and Blaise and so forth and so forth. Even they feel boring now.

Yeah. A great read. Short, and not at all sweet.
