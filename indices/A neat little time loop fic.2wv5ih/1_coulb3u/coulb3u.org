I love the fic /Getting the Hang of Thursdays/, in which Severus and Hermione find themselves the only ones able to perceive a dreadful timeloop which is degrading everything caught within it. It's quite long and very good, but right now I'm struggling to find a link to it, as the domain it was hosted on has lapsed. I'll keep looking and post a link if I can find one--it's definitely worth the read.

/Edit: There's a copy on Ashwinder [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=6501&i=1][(here)]] but it's got awful formatting, which is a bit of a shame./
