My picks for "Most Authentic Versions of Luna":

- The works of BrokenWingsHealed, beginning with "A Boy, A Girl, An Owl, and A Train Compartment".
- Some oldies but goodies: the works of Michelle-31A. I'm enclosing one of her funniest shorts, but I would certainly encourage you to dig further.
- "Tomorrowland" by winterfool (alias lavellenchanted on tumblr): possibly the best Harry/Luna story in existence, and the author is an incredibly sweet person who frequently responds to writing prompts on tumblr (but is currently on a bit of a backlog).
- "Crescent Moons" by demigoddesses. This is a sweet little piece of fluff.
- And if you'd like some good erotica (H/L are adults in all these stories), I think "In Spite of Nargles" and "A Life Very Much Less Than Ordinary" are probably the two best ones out there, as well as MayorHaggar's recent "We Wish You..." series.
