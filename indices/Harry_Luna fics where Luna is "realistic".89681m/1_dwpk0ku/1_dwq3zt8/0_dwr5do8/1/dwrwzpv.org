Tbh, it's so easy to subscribe to that theory. Every moment Harry and Luna share in OoTP feels really sweet and honest.

I think one the biggest problems people have with canon Harry/Ginny is the suddenness of it. It hardly feels earned to me. Compared to the subtle way Luna kind of worms into Harry's heart, Harry/Ginny seems rather shallow in comparison.

I mean, Luna and Harry's relationship changes so much over the course of book 5. There's a lot of real growth for both characters and you can see that just from reading their interactions.

I actually remember tearing up reading some of their moments in Deathly Hallows back in 2007, the mural on the ceiling, the patronus, the casual slipping of her name when Harry thinks about the people he loves...

Goddamn those lovely weirdos in the Hogwarts express, man.
