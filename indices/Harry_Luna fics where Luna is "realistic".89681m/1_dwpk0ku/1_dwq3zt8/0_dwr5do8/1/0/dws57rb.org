I love Ginny. She's a feisty badass. But that's not what Harry needs in a partner (although it's a nice quality to have in an adopted younger sister). He's already feisty on his own and doesn't need more fire. What he needs instead is someone calm and airy, someone who can just walk in the room and soothe him before she even opens her mouth to say anything because she already understands what he needs (and he knows she does). Look at Luna's very last appearance in the series: she creates a distraction so Harry can get away and have some peace and quiet.

Now imagine her doing something similar later on, after they're married: they go over to The Burrow to visit the Weasleys and some reporters show up at the door trying to get an interview with Harry. Arthur asks Harry if he'd like to use the Floo to escape, and Harry glances over at Luna, who just gives him this look of "I've got this." Then, while he escapes, she goes to speak with the reporters and completely disarms them by asking them questions about when they're going to cover various conspiracy theories from /The Quibbler/.
