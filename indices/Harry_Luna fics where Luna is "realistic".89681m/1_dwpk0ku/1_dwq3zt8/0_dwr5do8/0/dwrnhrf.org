JKR apparently had the final epilogue already written out by the end of CoS (maybe even by the end of PS/SS), although I could have /sworn/ Luna was being set up as Harry's future girlfriend/wife when I read OotP for the first time. For starters, her name was "Lovegood", and names in HP are usually a pretty good indicator of what role a character is going to play - but also, she was depicted as staring at Harry very intently, and there was a sort of unruliness and social awkwardness about her that seemed to fit with the neglected Harry we'd first been introduced to back in PS/SS.

I think that might be the problem with already being determined as to how you want to end a story: you don't anticipate what other characters you might develop later, who could possibly change how well your original plan looked. I'd like to at least know if JKR ever considered changing her ending once she'd created Luna and seen how well she and Harry complemented each other. I'd also like to know if she ever bothered writing (or at least drafting) an alternate "Harry-and-Luna" epilogue.
