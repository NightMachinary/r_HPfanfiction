Well, there's a post-war fic called linkffn(Unspeakable Beauty) where she, obviously from the tittle, becomes an Unspeakable 4 years after the war, and her personality is somewhat different, because of both the war and the fact that she "lost" her father, which was the link for her to those "animals". Quite sweet story, unfortunately, its abandoned.
