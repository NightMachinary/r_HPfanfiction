Theory: both Hagrid and Flitwick are part of an experimental wizard/creature breeding programme done by the unspeakables. Magical version of IVF obviously. They're the only two successful "outcomes," and Hagrid was taken away from his mum and sent to live with his human dad when she tried to eat him. Flitwick had a little more success with his creature side of the family, and spent all his holiday time at Gringotts with his goblin dad. It was so boring, he read book after book after book, and that is why he is now head of Ravenclaw.
