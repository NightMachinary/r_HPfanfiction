Centaur-shaped animals are a fun thought exercise. There's nothing wrong with redundant organs if the hearts aren't conflicting with each other. Personally, I liked a similar sci-fi race that had a secondary air intake at the small of the humanoid body's back that supplied the larger set of lungs. No sensory organs, there though. For the digestive tract, the most logical thing would be either a multi-chambered stomach, or a stomach on the horse body.
