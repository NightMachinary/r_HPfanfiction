Horses are not obligate herbivores; they can safely eat meat and will do so if they get the opportunity. They usually don't, seeing as they're built for grazing, and its not terribly good for them when they do, but some horses will stomp on birds that get too close and eat them if they're hungry enough.

A centaur would likely have no problems with an omnivorous diet, especially if the food is cooked for the human half.
