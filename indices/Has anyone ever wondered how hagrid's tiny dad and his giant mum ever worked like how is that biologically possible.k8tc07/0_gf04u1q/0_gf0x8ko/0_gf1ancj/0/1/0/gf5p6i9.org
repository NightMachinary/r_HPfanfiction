That'd be an ugly critter, but not something you'd want to fight in large numbers.

Inspiration! : DE's attack a muggleborn that gave up and left the wizarding world, that hates his boss at his cube farm job enough to cheat using magic to not work and still get paid, and spends all his time/money creating mix'n'match critters. Voldemort gets one junior DE back, bleeding out from a missing arm, tells the dark lord that there were /things/ at that house, so many things that shouldn't go together but have been joined. And they're /mean./ Voldemort looks into it, runs like hell when he sees the first basilisk/centipede, and it's FAST. He doesn't see super angry muggleborn guy mind-wiping and turning the surviving DE's into lamina/naga with magically altered basilisks.

A few years later, absolutely disgusted with how the Ministry allowed so many DEs to walk, he becomes a new dark lord, the lord of mis-matched beasts. He sends out composit hunting dogs and collects every muggleborn together, (HP goes along for the ride, meets new people that are JUST like him, is happier in dark lord legions than at his Uncle's) and trains them to be his army, working alongside his beast legions.

Raids in the night, he doesn't kill his enemies, no, the DE that got off become parts of greater creatures. He becomes the worst dark lord ever because he wins, and every foe that falls in battle has their mind altered and joins the mis-shapen horde. Harry and Hermione bond over creating lion/tiger/whatever-people, after raiding the London Zoo and Malfoy/greengrass Manor. (Don't worry Daphne! You're going to be our friend forever, we just need to make you better first!) When he runs out of obvious targets he sails to Azkaban, and uses the prisoners as parts.

The World trembles before the might of the BEAST LORD!
