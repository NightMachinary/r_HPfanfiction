It probably won't get started till I'm nearly finished with my current fic, but I have a 46k word, sometimes rambling outline for a fic where HP spends his early years, about from 7 till the goblet of fire, as a black panther. (Or similiar, it's a magical composite form) Essentially, Vernon gets caught stealing funds from his work, gets drunk, beats HP, gets drunker and is about to kill him when a 'Great Spirit' named Bast who is a powerful creature but not a God, (was known as a deity of protection, cats, perfume/ointments, fertility, pregnancy, children, music, the arts, and warfare; â€˜Bastet' was also depicted as the goddess of protection against contagious diseases and evil spirits) steps in to save Harry. Her kind have a law that keeps them from overly interfering in humanity, cause they don't actually want to be worshipped. But, because Harry needed the help, she's free to save him in the whatever way amuses her the most.

Harry spends his formative years wandering England, with a Fidelius like effect keeping everyone, including him, from realizing he's HP. Bast provides suggestive magic that leas him to learn to enjoy life, eventually he meets HG, realizes she can do magic like him and moves in with her. when Minvera shows up, the two of them have been watching anime as a source of figuring out their magic. Harry enjoys life as a cat for the most part, ends up truly hating the ministry, he collects a harem and accidentally an army of werewolves before the goblet forces the revelation. By then, Harry has raised a sailing ship from the depths, and used it to ward-break several private islands whose families have died out. He has been preparing for war against the british ministry for years, and doesn't see a reason to stop.

He also gained an animagus form of a gryphon, Thunderbird and Neimian Lion, and Hedwig reincarnated to this universe as a Thunderbird, (more war-like counterpoint to the peaceful phoenixes) named Static. Harry Potter becomes *the Beast Lord*, having built alliances with all sorts of creatures. Features a planned chapter with the Goblins Rebelling, trying to screw HP and the Ministry, and Harry yells "Curse you Goblins and your sudden, yet inevitable betrayl! Oh, if only someone, some wise and brave soul could have forseen this event! Oh, woe is us!" As his army of wolves, creatures, and golems (HP watched SW: Phantom Menace, and was inspired.) portals in with gear/etc specialized for fighting gobs in tunnels appears.

There's a strong focus on non-human magical creatures, HP working with anyone he can, students of Hogwarts creating pokemon knock-offs with magic, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo7XPvwRgG8]] being the magic to summon raised ships and call them to your location, /PIRATE MAGIC/, and a very bad-ass HP.

Also, it will probably have a lot of smut, so might not be for everyone, but I can add warnings for Ao3.
