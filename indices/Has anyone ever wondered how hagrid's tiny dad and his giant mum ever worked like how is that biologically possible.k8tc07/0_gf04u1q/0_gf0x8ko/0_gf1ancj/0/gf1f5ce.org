It feels weird to have an herbivore and an omnivore together. If I was going to stick animals together I'd choose an omnivore and a meat-eater. Horses go through a /lot/ of physical food, and they're sort of an inefficient (In that they don't extract as much nutrients out of their food as something like a sheep or goat with the four-chambered stomach.) eater. People called them 'hayburners' for a reason. Something like a tiger or lion might work out better.

It's also a good thing magic isn't real, I probably would have been the guy in highschool with an army of raven/housecat gryphons running around.
