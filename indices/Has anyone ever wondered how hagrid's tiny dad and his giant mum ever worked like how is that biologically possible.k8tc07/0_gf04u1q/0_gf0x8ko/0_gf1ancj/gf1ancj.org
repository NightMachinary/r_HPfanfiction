C.S. Lewis states clearly that centaurs have two stomachs and you must feed both the horse and human side, which is why no one likes inviting centaurs to dinner. I'd definitely expect JKR's centaurs to hold with this, and the only way I can explain it is to say it's magic, not science or even sci-fi.

Of all the organs I have to say it's the lungs that I'd never considered. But they are indeed the most problematic... is it possible centaurs take a long time to say anything because they're busy breathing in enough to fill two sets of lungs before they reply?
