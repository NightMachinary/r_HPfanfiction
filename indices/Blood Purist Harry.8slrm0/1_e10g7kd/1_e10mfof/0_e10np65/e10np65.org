He generally despises muggle, and looks down on muggleborns (he considers his mother a exception because she was powerful).

He doesent really regret being a blood purist, but reconsiders his opinion about muggeborns and thinks that while magical heritage helps a lot, it isn't everything. He also support a law to take away wizard children from muggle parents have them be adopted by wizarding famlies. He also only really dates pure-blood girls.
