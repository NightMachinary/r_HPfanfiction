Being raised by Voldemort in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2913149/1/The-Darkness-Within][The Darkness Within]], linkffn(2913149), he was a clear blood purist. He stayed quite loyal to Voldemort throughout this story, only turning against him when Voldemort tried to kill/torture his brother, whom he grew very attached to. Even then, he felt quite guilty turning against Voldemort, and much of the second fic in the series dealt with this issue. In the third installment, he swapped places with canon Harry, and he was still holding back when facing Voldemort.
