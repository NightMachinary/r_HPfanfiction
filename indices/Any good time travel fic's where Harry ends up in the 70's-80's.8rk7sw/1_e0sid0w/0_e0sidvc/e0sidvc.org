  After looking into Snape's pensieve, Harry makes up his mind to take charge of his actions. Before he can do that, he is sent back in time to 1975. He must find his own way back to the future without upsetting the timeline - but the Dark Lord is on the rise, and Harry's never been good at keeping his head down.Canon Divergent after "Snape's Worst Memory" in OotP.
