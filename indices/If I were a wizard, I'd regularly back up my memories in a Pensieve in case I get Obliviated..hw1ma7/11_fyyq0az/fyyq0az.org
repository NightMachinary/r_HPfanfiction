I don't remember if this is fannon or headcannon or actual cannon but I believe in cannon that their was a line about how if memory was removed too many times it would cause issues in Goblet of Fire on that muggle. I think that they also said something similar in Half Blood Prince for wizards volentarily removing memorys for recolection if done enough times, though we don't ever get a hard number but the danger is there. So I probably wouldn't do it regularly, maybe Yearly or every other year? I mean its degrading on your memories and adding onto that the actual degradation that comes from time and I would assume a wizard who meant well and did so ended up as a horror story in Mungos. Still in general a backup could be useful as it would prevent lock-heart situations.

TLDR; While somewhat useful when up against a novice or uncaring Obliviator up against a master it would be a lot more harm then good and while its something that should be done, it needs to be done sparingly.
