No. I'd half my lifespan to totally screw over a Dark Lord or two, who most definitely wouldn't expect weaponized use of a Time Turner, given that â€˜terrible things' happen to a wizard that messes with time. And given that older-me is the public one, I'd be testing that theory extensively; safeguarded by magical oaths of course.

I'm not really losing anything, after all. I'm a Muggle now, so I can accept a normal Muggle lifespan, I've not giving anything up, just not gaining anything either, there.
