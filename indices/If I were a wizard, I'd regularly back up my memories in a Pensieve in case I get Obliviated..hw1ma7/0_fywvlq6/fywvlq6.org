Have fun spending two weeks going through another two weeks of your life to find the 10 minutes that were wiped from your mind. That's assuming you had the time that day to spent half an hour pulling a day's worth of memories out your mind before it got obliviated.

Actually, the worst case is probably not getting obliviated. Then you spent two weeks going through your memories for nothing.

In short, there are better ways of protecting your mind.

Edit: In reply to OP's now-deleted comment regarding a filing system to better organize one's memories within a pensive:

  I mean, it seems from canon that you can call up specific memories at will. The organization isn't really an issue. The issue is that, by nature of having your memory wiped, you're not going to know you have been obliviated. It gets even worse if your obliviator uses the false memory charm as well. You'd be spending incredible amounts of time going through your memories out of the low chance you've been obliviated. You might as well just keep a detailed journal, it'd be more concise that way.

  Pensieve memories are exact. You'd literally have to look carefully through every second to make sure everything is consistent. Imagine if you're Fudge's assistant and he wipes the memory of seeing a sensitive file on his desk the next day, replacing it with a memory of a different file. You've spent 10 hours going through your memories of that day. Do you really think you're going to notice the discrepancy of a secret file on his desk?
