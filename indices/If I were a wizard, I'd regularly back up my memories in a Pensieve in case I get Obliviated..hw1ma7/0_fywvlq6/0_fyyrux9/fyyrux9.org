Maybe someone could build a Pensieve/Computer hybrid with encryption and a checksum feature. Any change changes the checksum which is easy to compare. Modifying a memory without changing the checksum would require reverse engineering the memory hashing algorithm. Modern cryptography has a lot of neat techniques for preventing people from messing with important data.
