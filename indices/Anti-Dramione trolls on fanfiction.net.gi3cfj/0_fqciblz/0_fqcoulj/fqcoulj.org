I agree that it usually does suck ass, but it can be done well and believably. The issue with it, like the issue with all the common tropes, is that a most fanfic writers aren't good writers. However, I'd say that after a certain point in canon, the idea of Draco and Hermione ending up together does stretch unbelievably thin.

The only pairing I absolutely stay away from is Harry/Voldemort because that is just wrong on so many levels
