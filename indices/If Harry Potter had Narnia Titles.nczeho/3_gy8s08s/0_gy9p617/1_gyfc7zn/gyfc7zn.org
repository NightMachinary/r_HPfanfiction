The letter, the stone, and the trapdoor

The book, the heir, and the chamber

The map, the wolf, and the traitor

The cup, the game, and the graveyard

The phoenix, the inquisitor, and the veil

The spy, the past, and the tower

The wand, the stone, and the cloak

I feel like 3 and 6 are the hardest to do this way, with 7, 4 and 2 as the easiest
