I would avoid using the same word twice and to avoid giving out too many spoilers I would go with:

1. The letters, the castle, and the mirror
2. The voice, the ghost, and the diary
3. The grim, the dementors, and the traitor
4. The broom, the herb, and the cup
5. The dreams, the pigs, and the seer
6. The war, the memory, and the assassination
7. The hunt, the death, and the immortal
