I thought you meant titles in the royalty sense of the word, which I also think could be neat.

The Pevensie kids all live to adulthood and become Narnian royalty, then revert back to being children when they leave. Starting the story /after/ Harry comes back from Narnia seems like a pretty viable way to give him lots of traits that authors seem to love giving him, without it seeming out of place. Mature for his age, cynical, overly-familiar with politics, skilled at magic, out-of-context magic abilities, etc. Benefits of time travel without the pesky future knowledge.

It also gives you a nice excuse for characterization flashbacks, a source of potential mysteries (people he only knew as adults in Narnia, now in the outside world as children?), and probably other potentially useful stuff without having to clutter the story with a full crossover.
