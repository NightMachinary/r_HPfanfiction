It's one of my most favorite fanfics ever, I didn't like the last/fourth part as much as the rest, but especially the second part is worth it on its own, and even the last part still had great things in it.

The way bonds and life debts work is a big part of the story, and I really like the way both were done here. I can't say too much without spoiling things, but they're well worked out concepts in this story. No two kids kissing creating a soul bond or anything like that.
