Many times, I'd agree with you. But there are also a lot of pranks that are done very well, and are the ones I'm curious about.

murkybluematter has written thoughtful and creative prank scenes that I've enjoyed (bathroom grape juice, school-wide notes). Her take on pranks is mostly what I'm thinking of -- ones that are decidedly not malicious, and designed to create a happy atmosphere. Pranks that include everyone, require effort, and expand on uses for magic. Another example was a fic where a Hogwarts hallway was enchanted to not let anyone pass unless they tapped out "God Save the Queen" across musically-charmed tiles. I'm not impressed by the magical equivalent of a whoopee cushion, no, but the ones that are absolutely riveting and effective for the story.
