I have to agree partly with what was said above: pranks sometimes derail the story too much, making it look silly.

Anyway, there's a funny one that I remember (although not very innovative) : Harry had somehow put a spell on Snape, and whenever he entered a room his cape would billow wildly and the Batman's theme would be heard from ... somewhere around. Not sure of what story that was from.
