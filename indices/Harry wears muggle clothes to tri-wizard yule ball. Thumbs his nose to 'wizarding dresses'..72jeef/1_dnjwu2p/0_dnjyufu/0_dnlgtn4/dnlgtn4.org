That's just stupid(no offence meant to you). I mean I asked for a slightly more rebellious Harry towards the uniform, not some stronger than dumbledore, and thinks muggles have it all figured out. I mean this is literally just around his clothing choice, and how he prefers muggle clothes. I mean if you went from america to india you would prefer to dress up in american clothes still, and that is all i'm asking for. Not one where he has a harem, or learns/gains all of voldemorts powers through his hocrux.

You know what I mean. Again sorry it's just how everyone seems to literally hate anything, but canon Harry annoys the shit out of me. I mean people write fanfiction for one of two reasons to either explore other characters, or change the story, and when you want to change the story suprise that is a different character who is NOT canon.
