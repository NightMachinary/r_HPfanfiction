  Do you have a main plot in mind as you write, or do you just write and see where your plot goes? If it's the former, how do you keep track of the nuances of your story/plot?
#+end_quote

I try to do a plot outline where I write down like 1-40 on notebook paper, and put the final scene I have in mind at 40 and the first scene at 1. Then I fill in the other 38 lines in the order I think I'd like to see them happen.

It never works out the way I planned it, but at least it helps remind me what my point was when I started. I redo this list periodically at least in my head, and write it down when I remember to do so.

Lately I've kept it as a spreadsheet and try to plan out each chapter in plotpoints instead. I keep fairly copious notes both on paper and on the computer of random thoughts that pop into my head.

And I have a beta/writing partner to remind me of what I've forgotten.

When I wrote Searching For The Power though, I had none of those things. I still had lots of nuance, but I had no idea what I was doing dropping those breadcrumbs until something snuck up on me and I went "oooooooh, so thats where that was leading." At least once though, that painted me into a corner and ended up with somebody dead.... so yes, keeping track is important; but you can do it just in your head if the idea is fully formed enough.

It also helps that I think hard and do a psych mock-up of each character important to the story. What is their motivation? What is their background? Where are they coming from and why would they respond to certain situations. At that point the story can write itself because you just introduce the scene, then let it play out.

  Where does your inspiration/motivation to write come from? Putting out 100k a month is rather tough, so I'm just curious if you write because you enjoy it of if it's a cathartic release or any other reason.

Most of my motivation comes from watching HP Fanfiction die... it has been such a large part of my life. Now all the "good fic" seems to have been written, the old authors are giving up, the new ones are okay but havent completed most of their stories and I hate taking a chance on a WIP only for it to die and never be written again.. (yes I know that is hypocritical of me)

Otherwise, there was a specific girl that inspired Searching for the Power. For the others the inspiration was really the above, being bored and doing something about it. I write mostly to entertain myself.

  I want to begin writing fan fiction. Any advice? (I'll take all I can get!)

Make sure you plan out the story before you begin.

Try to write on a schedule, any schedule. Be it once a week, every 2 weeks, or once a month. As long as you stick to the schedule you will get loyal readers and a fair number of reviews. When you go off schedule without warning, people begin to think the story has been abandoned.

Listen to reviewers but do not let them run your story for you

Write for yourself, if you don't enjoy it you won't stick with it. You can't please everybody so do it for you and others will agree.

Get a beta / pre-reader! Nothing can kill a great story quicker than grammar and punctuation.
