also a note: a chapter might only be 10k long, but my beta and I probably have conversation logs that are 60k on a semi-nightlly basis.

Being someone who just naturally has a lot to say in print/chat helps a lot when talking about writing a chapter a week. You dont have to write tat much, that often... but I'd have a 5 or 10 chapter buffer if you write slowly, to be able to post something for the readers when you get behind or have to go off schedule...

I need to take my own advice on that last one though, im currently in write/beta/post mode myself.
