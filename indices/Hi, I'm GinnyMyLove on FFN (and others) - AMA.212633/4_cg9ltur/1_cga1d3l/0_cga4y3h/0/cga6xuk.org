I found my beta by accident, someone I know in real life was reading the story after I told them I write fanfiction. Sent me a PM and I didn't realize it was the same person for like 4 chapters til we were talking IRL again.

When I beta'd for 'Love Has No Age' it was an open call asking for a beta, in an authors note.

You can join the various Yahoo groups for HP Fanfiction to find a beta too. On Fanfiction.net there are people who mark themselves as available for beta on certain fandoms but I haven't looked into it.

Basically, if you put it out there that you are looking, you'll probably get a few nibbles. Might post a chapter or two in those yahoo groups I was talking about, or online at your favorite site; then ask for beta candidates.

The best beta is one who understands your story and is willing to both edit it AND bounce ideas with you. But be careful not to abuse them or steal their ideas because they can decide to stop being your beta just as fast as they joined you (see authors note on the latest chapter of Animagus Mishap).
