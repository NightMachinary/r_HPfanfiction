  How much do you plan out stories before you start writing? Like how detailed do you go into side-plots and chapters and such?
#+end_quote

I typically get a story idea but don't write a single word until it is fully formed in my head. I like to know exactly which characters will be included and what the endgame is before I begin. Once it is all set up in my head I don't have to work at it, I just write what is happening in my head!

  How did you find a beta?
#+end_quote

I've worked without a beta for the longest time and did okay. But on the current story I had someone I know in real life offer, it took me months to realize the person who offered via PM was my cousin! So now we can hang out and bounce ideas off each other in person. Luckily we are both ADHD, both have extremely similar thought processes ... it is actually scary sometimes when we are chatting and both have the exact same though... it happens often.

  What type of scenes or interactions do you enjoy writing the most?
#+end_quote

I obviously enjoy writing romance and smut the most, though crack is probably my favorite wherever I can insert it. I love laughing at my own jokes, especially when I come back and read my own story years later. I often think "God this author is amazing!" before I realize I'm mentally masturbating.

  Ever thought of writing any next-gen Harry Potter?
#+end_quote

I've thought about it sure, just like I've thought about doing a Marauder fic. It would be much easier to be original... but I haven't read ANY next-gen and only one or two Marauder fics. I'd be coming at it completely out of nowhere ... and still likely end up using all the cliches without knowing it. They are cliche because they work.

  How long does it take you to write the typical chapter?
#+end_quote

It takes me a bout 5 days to write a typical chapter if I work on it every night. I can occasionally write an entire 10k or so word chapter in one night if I'm really on my game, but with life interfering it gets hard. When I wrote 'Searching For The Power' I actually wrote the first 170k words or so in one month.

No beta though, having a beta definitely slows things down because I like having his input on things, and because I have to wait for him to clean up my punctuation before I can post. I want to post as soon as I'm done, and I want to write 3 or 4 chapters ahead... but I can't make myself. I'm too eager to post it as soon as it is done; this means I have to make certain I know where the story is going so I don't contradict myself, or paint myself into a corner /cough-dead-character-cough/

  How much do you write/work on stories a day?
#+end_quote

I try to write at least 1k words a night, but it doesn't usually work out that way. Working on stories every single night is my hobby. My beta and I will chat about the story for hours on end without writing an actual word in the current chapter. We intermix that with life happenings and the current bleach or naruto manga as well, so it isn't all work.

Typical week... I probably spend between 7 and 20 hours on a chapter total. Only part of that is actual writing though.
