I've heard of you, but I have no idea how I've heard of you. But you like HPMoR, so you're good in my book.

How much do you plan out stories before you start writing? Like how detailed do you go into side-plots and chapters and such?

How did you find a beta?

What type of scenes or interactions do you enjoy writing the most?

Ever thought of writing any next-gen Harry Potter?

How long does it take you to write the typical chapter?

How much do you write/work on stories a day?
