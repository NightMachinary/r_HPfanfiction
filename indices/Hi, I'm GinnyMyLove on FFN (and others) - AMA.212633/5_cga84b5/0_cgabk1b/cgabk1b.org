I'm not really following any HP fic at the moment, started reading Animagus Mishap as my Beta was also, but not really "following" it.

EroNinja and Ahsikabi no Shinobi from the Naruto-verse are currently in my following stories. And I'm probably going to read "Here In My Arms" soon, a completed Rosario+Vampire fic recommeded to me by my beta.

Not much in HP interests me at the moment, that is why I'm writing.

edit: Letters from the Asylum is a fun WIP Crackfic that I'm following in HP
