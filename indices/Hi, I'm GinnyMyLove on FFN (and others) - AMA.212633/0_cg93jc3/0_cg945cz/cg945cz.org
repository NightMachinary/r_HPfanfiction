There is a lot about fanfiction that I feel "has been done already" so I try to stay away from it. That said, I'd like to write a full 7 year story but I'm super intimidated. The main problem being I know my strength is in romance and smut, and I'd be too tempted to start them young.

I think the only thing that distinguishes me from other authors are:

A) Word Count - I can crank out 100k a month when I'm feeling it. Large wordcount tends to draw in readers.

B) Characters - My characters almost all have a complete backstory in my head, and a full Psych workup so I know exactly how they will respond to any given situation and why. That means I have an idea for a scene, I put the characters into it, and then they do their own thing. I seriously just write down what they are doing, I don't have to think too hard about it ... voices in my head

C) Smut - Write what you know ... and I know sex and I think I understand women as well as any man can so it translates into well written smut. Even people who don't like romance novels can enjoy my version. Romance Novels *for men

I wish I were better at world building; the reason I haven't written my own original idea yet is because creating my own world is intimidating. I could write the hell out of TV episodes or possibly something like a Star Wars Novel... Except the other thing I wish I was better at is writing any sort of fight / battle, and controlling the plot for conflict and ending an antagonist.

Apparently I have no idea how to end Voldemort orignally. It's all been done so I usually end up phoning in an explanation for his demise, or come up with something ridikuous like having God go after him and capture him in chapter 3...
