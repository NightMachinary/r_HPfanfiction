Why is so hard for people to imagine that the stronghold built in the 900's started small and was upgraded over time? Of course it wasn't a stone castle at first. I'm convinced that the Room of Requirement was not added until much later, and Salazar's crypt was just a nearby cave until the structure grew to connect to it.
