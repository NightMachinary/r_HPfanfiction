The characters seem like blank slates as opposed to fully formed characters from a series we know.

'Umbitch', 'Sod off', 'Whatever', 'douchebaggery' - it seems very OOC for Ernie.

There's a lot of conversation, not a lot of description. The speech goes into several topics in quick succession, with the characters giving short but emotional responses to each of them. You can explain what's happening without having characters speak it.

I do like the idea though, would be good to see the reactions of Hufflepuff house to the seventh year. Could see it as a decent alternative to Year of Darkness.
