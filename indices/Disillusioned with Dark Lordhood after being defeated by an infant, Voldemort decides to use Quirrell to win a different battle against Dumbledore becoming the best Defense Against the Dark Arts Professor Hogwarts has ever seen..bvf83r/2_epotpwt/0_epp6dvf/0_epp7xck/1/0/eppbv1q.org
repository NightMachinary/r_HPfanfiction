It's meh. It's a huge author wank by Eliezer Yudkowsky who uhh is a divisive personality. I'm definitely more on the against side but I read the whole fic and most of it while it was a WIP and I used to think the author was one of the most interesting guys I'd ever heard of. It's kinda the daddy Rational fic similar to the Wave Arisen for the Naruto fandom (pretty good tbh) or the Metropolitan Man for Superman (actually freaking excellent, I'm not even into DC stuff) and there are various web originals that have a similar "Rational" aesthetic that are pretty great but I just overall kinda hate HPMOR in retrospect
