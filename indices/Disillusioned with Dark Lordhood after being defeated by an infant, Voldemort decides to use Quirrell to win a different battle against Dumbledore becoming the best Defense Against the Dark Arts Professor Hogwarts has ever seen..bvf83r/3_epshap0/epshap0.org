So in Wolf Lord, this is referenced sorta in a single moment where Remus mentioned the material left behind by Quirrell is halfway decent and what he is going to be building his own classes off of since he got the job a month before it started.

I feel like Voldemort wouldn't let Quirrell do a terrible job as a teacher and wouldn't worry about any student, not matter how well taught, being an actual threat to him. The stuttering was a cover and the garlic hid the smell, but I imagine Quirrell was probably a pretty decent teacher when you weren't being legitimized all class.
