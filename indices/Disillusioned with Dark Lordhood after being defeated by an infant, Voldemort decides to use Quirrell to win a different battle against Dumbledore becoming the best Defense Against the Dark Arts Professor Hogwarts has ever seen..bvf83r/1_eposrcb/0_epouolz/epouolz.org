I know of one where, after hearing the prophecy, Voldie decides he's given up so much to be alive already, and that he could give up England too. Who needs servants, an army or a country? He'd rather be alive, so he cuts his losses and quits as dark lord. He just up and moves to an island to wait ten centuries for the world to forget him.

I couldn't find the link tho', so I hope somebody else can.
