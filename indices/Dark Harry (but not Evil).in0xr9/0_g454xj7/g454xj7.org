Check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12723942/1/Out-of-the-Night][Out of Night by Raining Ink]]. It's a classic, sadly abandoned. linkffn(12723942)

There's also [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20049589/chapters/47480461][Evitative by Vichan]]. Sequels are in the works (can't wait). linkao3(20049589)

This doesn't quite fit your request, but I'm related to the author so I'll shamelessly family-promote. It has a dark-not-evil Harry: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23478781/chapters/57588097][A Linear Progression by billboard_dinosaur]]. linkao3(23478781)

Editing to add [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14931932/chapters/34592909][A Story of Mortality by this_bright_eyed_soul]]. linkao3(14931932). Very beautiful but sad. Not to mention it's complete!
