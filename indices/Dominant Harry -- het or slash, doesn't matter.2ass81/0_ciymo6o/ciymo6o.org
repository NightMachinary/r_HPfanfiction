[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8648528/1/Mirrored][Mirrored]] is a Harrymort one that comes to mind but it's a very odd dominance. [[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewuser.php?uid=163][Meri]] writes a bit of top!Harry snarry. [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/HecatesKiss/pseuds/HecatesKiss][HecatesKiss]] writes a bit of dominant!Harry but her writing is both excellent and very mechanical if that makes sense. I have some more slash based ficts if you want more.
