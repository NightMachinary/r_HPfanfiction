  I think you're overstating how weakened Dumbledore is at this point.
#+end_quote

he couldn't apparate himself and was clutching at his chest, and Draco hit him in the same moment Dumbledore choose to freeze Harry.

  but I don't think he'd be easily killed by a 6th year student.

He was wandless and weakened, I think you are underestimating how much of a advantage that is for Draco.

  The way Dumbledore goes about planning the Deathly Hallows to fall into Harry's posession is too convoluted otherwise IMHO.
#+end_quote

But there is no way Dumbledore could have planned for the Elder Wand to pass to Harry, even if for some reason he intended for Draco to become the Master. He couldn't be sure that Harry would defeat Draco before he sacrifices himself, or even before Draco is defeated himself. Also if Dumbledore had allowed Draco to disarm him, it wouldn't count as defeat, the same way Harry allowing Voldemort to kill him didn't count as defeat.

Harry basically ended up as master of the Elder Wand and owner of all deathly Hallows by sheer Luck. If anyone else had defeated Draco then Harry would probably never have ended up with it. In Malfoy Manor for example it could easily have been Ron who disarmed Draco and not Harry.
