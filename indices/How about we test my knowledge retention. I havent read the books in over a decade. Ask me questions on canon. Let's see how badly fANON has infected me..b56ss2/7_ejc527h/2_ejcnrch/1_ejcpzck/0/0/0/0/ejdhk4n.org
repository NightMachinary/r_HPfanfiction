  Dumbledore was able to magically hold Harry frozen throughout the confrontation, but couldn't disarm Draco?
#+end_quote

Draco was prepared for Dumbledore and Harry wasnt, nothing would stop Draco from shielding himself against Dumbledore, who was weakened and wandless.

​

#+begin_quote
  A much more likely theory is that he intentionally let Draco disarm him, so that mastership of the wand would become muddled after his death.
#+end_quote

​

No its not, having the Elder Wand loose its power is a much more desirable goal, then to have it pass to Draco.

#+begin_quote
  Nobody was witness to this scene except for Harry, so this was information only Harry (and Snape in the film) could figure out.
#+end_quote

And Draco who could easily have shared it with the other Death Eaters and Voldemort.

#+begin_quote
  but why else would Dumbledore leave the Resurrection Stone to Harry
#+end_quote

so Harry could speak to his Friends and Family, but only when he was going to die. Maybe he even intended for Harry to speak to him.

#+begin_quote
  Why would he make Harry stand still while witnessing Draco disarm him?
#+end_quote

Because Harry was under the invisibly cloak and Dumbledore didn't want Harry to reveal his position to the death eaters and possibly stop Snape from killing him.

#+begin_quote
  there is evidence in the text to argue that the disposition of the Deathly Hallows were also very important in Harry surviving death and defeating Voldemort.
#+end_quote

No to the first part, yes to the second. Voldemort only lost because he was using Harrys wand, but the only reason the text states why he survived is this.

#+begin_quote
  ‘But if Voldemort used the Killing Curse,' Harry started again, ‘and nobody died for me this time -- how can I be alive?'

  ‘I think you know,' said Dumbledore. ‘Think back. Remember what he did, in his ignorance, in his greed and his cruelty.'

  Harry thought. He let his gaze drift over his surroundings. If it was indeed a palace in which they sat, it was an odd one, with chairs set in little rows and bits of railing here and there, and still, he and Dumbledore and the stunted creature under the chair were the only beings there. Then the answer rose to his lips easily, without effort.

  ‘He took my blood,' said Harry.

  ‘Precisely!' said Dumbledore. ‘He took your blood and rebuilt his living body with it! Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lily's protection inside both of you! He tethered you to life while he lives!'
