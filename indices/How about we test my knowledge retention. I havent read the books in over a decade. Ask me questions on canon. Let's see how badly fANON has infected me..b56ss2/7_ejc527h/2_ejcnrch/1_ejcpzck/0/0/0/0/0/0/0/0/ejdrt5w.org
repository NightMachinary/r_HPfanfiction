  You can't apparate in Hogwarts.
#+end_quote

Firstly Dumbledore can apparate to Hogwarts, and I actually meant that Dumbeldore wasnt able to apparate to Hogsmeade and Harry had to take them both.

#+begin_quote
  I'm talking about before he was disarmed.
#+end_quote

Draco wasn't even in the scene before Harry head somebody yell Expelliarmus from outside the room.

Its likely that Dumbeldore was caught off guard as well. The only time Dumbledore and Draco were in the same room Dumbledore was wandless.

#+begin_quote
  He froze Harry there to witness his disarmament and most likely death.
#+end_quote

He froze Harry so he wouldn't intervene, Dumbledore froze at the same time Draco busted the door open.

  Draco was an ideal person to gain mastery of the wand because he was in Harry's "weight class" in terms of combat ability and magical knowledge, their previous antipathy and the current circumstances basically guaranteed Harry would seek conflict with him in the coming fight, Draco's unique position as pampered son of precariously positioned yet still important Death Eaters means he would be too cowed to attack anyone, yet have protectors who would keep him from being attacked, insulating him from most circumstances where he would be "defeated".

And what if Voldemort decided to punish for not killing Dumbeldore himself, or if it were Ron or Hermione who succeeded in disarming him.

#+begin_quote
  It was a very tenuous plan, but when you go back throughout the books, so many of Dumbledore's plans were.
#+end_quote

But why would he use such a plan when in canon he stated his actual less complicated plan.

​

Look here

#+begin_quote
  ‘But you expected him to go after the wand?'

  ‘I have been sure that he would try, ever since your wand beat Voldemort's in the graveyard of Little Hangleton. At first, he was afraid that you had conquered him by superior skill. Once he had kidnapped Ollivander, however, he discovered the existence of the twin cores. He thought that explained everything. Yet the borrowed wand did no better against yours! So Voldemort, instead of asking himself what quality it was in you that had made your wand so strong, what gift you possessed that he did not, naturally set out to find the one wand that, they said, would beat any other. For him, the Elder Wand has become an obsession to rival his obsession with you. He believes that the Elder Wand removes his last weakness and makes him truly invincible. Poor Severus ...'

  ‘If you planned your death with Snape, you meant him to end up with the Elder Wand, didn't you?'

  ‘I admit that was my intention,' said Dumbledore, ‘but it did not work as I intended, did it?'

  ‘No,' said Harry. ‘That bit didn't work out.'

and

#+begin_quote
  ‘That wand still isn't working properly for you, because you murdered the wrong person.

  Severus Snape was never the true master of the Elder Wand. He never defeated Dumbledore. '

  ‘He killed --'

  ‘Aren't you listening?

  *Snape never beat Dumbledore! Dumbledore's death was planned between them! Dumbledore intended to die undefeated, the wand's last true master! If all had gone as planned, the wand's power would have died with him, because it had never been won from him! '*

  ‘But then, Potter, Dumbledore as good as gave me the wand!

  ' Voldemort's voice shook with malicious pleasure. ‘I stole the wand from its last master's tomb! I removed it against its last master's wishes! Its power is mine! '

  ‘You still don't get it, Riddle, do you?

  Possessing the wand isn't enough! Holding it, using it, doesn't make it really yours. Didn't you listen to Ollivander? The wand chooses the wizard ... the Elder Wand recognised a new master before Dumbledore died, someone who never even laid a hand on it. *The new master removed the wand from Dumbledore against his will, never realising exactly what he had done,* or that the world's most dangerous wand had given him its allegiance ...'

  Voldemort's chest rose and fell rapidly, and Harry could feel the curse coming, feel it building inside the wand pointed at his face.

  ‘The true master of the Elder Wand was Draco Malfoy.
