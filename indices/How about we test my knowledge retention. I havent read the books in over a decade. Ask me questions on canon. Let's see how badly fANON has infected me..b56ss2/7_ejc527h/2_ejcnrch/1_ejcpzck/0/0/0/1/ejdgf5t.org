For the stone, there are several theories that go from "manipulative Dumbledore using the stone to push Harry one final step toward his death" to "gentle old man wishing to give one last memory to Harry before he makes a sacrifice he may not come back".

But for Draco, I don't think it was a plot about the Elder Wand. I think it was more showing the foresight of Dumbledore.

He probably knew that if Draco was here, other Death Eaters would be near. Disarming Draco (no matter if he could or not after the potion) would have probably been enough for Voldemort to considere his task a faillure, and so kill him and his family, something he tried to avoid all year. Knowing Draco would not be able to finish the job and wait for Snape was a dangerous bet, but it's Dumbledore and not even his worst supposition.\\
So rather than disarming Draco, he did the most important thing for him, stopping Harry to act. If Harry was not paralyzed, it's pretty much assured he would have tried to protect Dumbledore, even if it means facing the whole pack of Death Eater. And Snape really would have had a hard time to not get him killed or captured if he was faced with him on top of the tower, unlike later when all the other focused on their escape.
