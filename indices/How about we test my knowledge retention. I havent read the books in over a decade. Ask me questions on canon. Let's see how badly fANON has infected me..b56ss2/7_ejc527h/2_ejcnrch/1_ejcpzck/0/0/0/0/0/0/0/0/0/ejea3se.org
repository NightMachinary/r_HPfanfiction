  Draco wasn't even in the scene before Harry head somebody yell Expelliarmus from outside the room.

You're assuming Dumbledore needs someone to be in the same room to perceive them.

  *Its likely* that Dumbeldore was caught off guard as well. The only time Dumbledore and Draco were in the same room Dumbledore was wandless.

That may be your reading of it, but it's not mine. Draco was stressed out because he didn't want to kill anyone, but he was also stressed because he knew that Dumbledore was a lot more powerful than he was. He didn't know how real his advantage over Dumbledore was. What I'm saying is that Dumbledore, the man who could defeat Grindelwald and stalemate Voldemort in direct magical duels, *chose* not to defend himself from Draco's disarming.

  But why would he use such a plan when in canon he stated his actual less complicated plan.
#+end_quote

The placement of the Elder Wand is indeed really tenuous and random. But the Resurrection Stone is much clearer and direct. Why leave Hermione a book about them? When there are several Horcruxes to be found and destroyed, why the focus on the Hallows? Why is the novel that covers the destruction of the Horcruxes called "The Deathly Hallows"? Dumbledore certainly attached more significance to them than you are arguing.
