  Draco was prepared for Dumbledore and Harry wasnt, nothing would stop Draco from shielding himself against Dumbledore, who was weakened and wandless.

I think you're overstating how weakened Dumbledore is at this point. I doubt he'd be able to survive a confrontation with Voldemort or effortlessly cow Bellatrix like he did at the end of OoTP at this point in HBP, but I don't think he'd be easily killed by a 6th year student. He let himself get disarmed because he never planned to fight Draco, not because he was to weak to do so.

I have never disagreed that the blood protection was what kept Harry alive through the killing curse (that would be stupid), but I contend you are downplaying the possibility that Dumbledore arranging the disposition of the Deathly Hallows was a measure to add an additional safeguard that Harry would survive. Dumbledore speaking to Harry in the afterlife is after it happened, and this Dumbledore obviously knows that the blood protection is what pulled through in the end. The way Dumbledore goes about planning the Deathly Hallows to fall into Harry's posession is too convoluted otherwise IMHO.
