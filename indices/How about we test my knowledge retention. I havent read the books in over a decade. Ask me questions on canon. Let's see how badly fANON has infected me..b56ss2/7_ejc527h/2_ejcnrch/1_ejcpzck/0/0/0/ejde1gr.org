  Dumbledore never planned for Harry to receive the Elder Wand, or to become its master. Dumbledore planned to die undefeated and for the Elder Wand to loose its power, its only because he was so weakened by the potion in the cave that Draco was able do disarm him.

Dumbledore was able to magically hold Harry frozen throughout the confrontation, but couldn't disarm Draco? That's ridiculous. A much more likely theory is that he intentionally let Draco disarm him, so that mastership of the wand would become muddled after his death. Nobody was witness to this scene except for Harry, so this was information only Harry (and Snape in the film) could figure out. Voldemort thinks Snape had mastery of the Elder Wand, and this is another thing that saves Harry IMHO.

  Also the hallows except for the wand dont have masters

I didn't mean that the cloak or stone acted like the wand.

  in case you forgot the Tale of the Deathly Hallows was just a legend, Dumbledore mentioned to Harry that they were merely three powerful objects created by the Peverell brothers.

Then why did Dumbledore hide the Resurrection stone inside the snitch to "open at the close"? Obviously the blood protection was planned far longer than the hallows, but why else would Dumbledore leave the Resurrection Stone to Harry, and a book with important hints about their significance to Hermione? Why would he make Harry stand still while witnessing Draco disarm him?

While the blood protection is the main reason Harry survived, there is evidence in the text to argue that the disposition of the Deathly Hallows were also very important in Harry surviving death and defeating Voldemort. To me this reads as someone who's made a long planned safeguard but added something else in the last minute just in case.
