  he couldn't apparate himself and was clutching at his chest, and Draco hit him in the same moment Dumbledore choose to freeze Harry.

You can't apparate in Hogwarts. It's the whole reason why Draco took a whole year to fix the Vanishing Cabinet.

  He was wandless and weakened, I think you are underestimating how much of a advantage that is for Draco.
#+end_quote

I'm talking about before he was disarmed. Draco was almost pissing himself, no matter how much of an advantage he had though.

He *chose* to let himself become wandless, because he wasn't going to fight Draco. You're talking about the situation *after* Dumbledore made the decision, which isn't that relevant.

  But there is no way Dumbledore could have planned for the Elder Wand to pass to Harry, even if for some reason he intended for Draco to become the Master.

He froze Harry there to witness his disarmament and most likely death. Draco was an ideal person to gain mastery of the wand because he was in Harry's "weight class" in terms of combat ability and magical knowledge, their previous antipathy and the current circumstances basically guaranteed Harry would seek conflict with him in the coming fight, Draco's unique position as pampered son of precariously positioned yet still important Death Eaters means he would be too cowed to attack anyone, yet have protectors who would keep him from being attacked, insulating him from most circumstances where he would be "defeated".

It was a very tenuous plan, but when you go back throughout the books, so many of Dumbledore's plans were. Sending Fawkes with the Sorting Hat against a basilisk? Sending two 13 year olds through time to rescue an innocent man against hundreds of Dementors? Spending a year doling out pieces of Voldemort's life story? Hiding the Resurrection Stone inside a snitch to only open when Harry's about to die?
