Dumbledore never planned for Harry to receive the Elder Wand, or to become its master. Dumbledore planned to die undefeated and for the Elder Wand to loose its power, its only because he was so weakened by the potion in the cave that Draco was able do disarm him.

Also the hallows except for the wand dont have masters, in case you forgot the Tale of the Deathly Hallows was just a legend, Dumbledore mentioned to Harry that they were merely three powerful objects created by the Peverell brothers.
