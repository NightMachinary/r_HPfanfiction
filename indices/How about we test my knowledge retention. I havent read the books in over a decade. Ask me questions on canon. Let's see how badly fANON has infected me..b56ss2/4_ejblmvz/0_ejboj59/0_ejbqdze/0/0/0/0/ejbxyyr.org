Tempus also isn't canon. Wizards use watches, its even a tradition to receive one when they turn seventeen. Also in the scene you meant Harry mixed up the incarnation of the growth charm and the colour change charm and had a rat grow to the size of a badger instead of turning it orange like he was meant to.
