There are wards in canon, however they are NEVER actually referred to as wards. The word “ward” in reference to such spells is never used.

Examples of spells that are a type of ward:

Muggle repelling spells around Hogwarts, the leaky cauldron, and the quidditch stadium

The seventh book where the trio cast spells to keep where they're camping hidden

Apparating/disapparating restricting spells

The magic protecting Harry at the Dursley's.

I'm sure there are more, but this is what I can find quickly. I hope that's enough.
