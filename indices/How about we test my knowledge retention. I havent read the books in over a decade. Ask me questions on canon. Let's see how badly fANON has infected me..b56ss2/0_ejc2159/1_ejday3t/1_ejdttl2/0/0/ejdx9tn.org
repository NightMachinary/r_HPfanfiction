I suppose the main reason would because than particular bit of fanon builds on what few sparse details we were given about the Potter family to reach a logical conclusion. It makes the world feel deeper, I suppose?

Fleamont came out of nowhere and was a completely new character with no previous links to any established characters. To me, it felt more like Rowling forgot about Charlus and Dorea when she was writing about James' family.

What even happened to those two? What was their story? How did they get married? When and how did they die? What happened to their unnamed son (who everyone assumed to have been James).

Rowling stated that Harry had no living family so that means Charlus, Dorea, their son and any potential grandchildren are dead. This made sense if you assumed Charlus and Dorea were Harry's grandparents and James their son. Without that assumption? We get a whole lot of questions.

What happened to them? How were they related to James? Will we ever get more information on them? Were they a detail Rowling included and then completely forgot about?

I don't think James and Sirius being cousins cheapens their friendship. Remember that Sirius hated his family. Wouldn't knowing James is the son of a Black made it less likely for them to become friends and not more? It also introduces another "good" Black. Slytherin being portrayed as the evil house is one of HP's often criticized flaws.

I also really liked the idea of Harry and Draco being cousins. Another very petty reason is that I like the name Charlus much better than Fleamont. It keeps to the Potter naming scheme.
