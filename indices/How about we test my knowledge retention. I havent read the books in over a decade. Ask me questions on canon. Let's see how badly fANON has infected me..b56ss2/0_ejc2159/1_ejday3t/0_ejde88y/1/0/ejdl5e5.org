  "A week ago, a student was taken from our midst.

  "Remember Cedric. Remember, if the time should come when you have to make a choice between what is right, and what is easy, remember what happened to a boy who was good, and kind, and brave, because he strayed across the path of Lord Voldemort. Remember Cedric Diggory."

- Dumbledore, Chapter 37, GoF.

Nah, I guess Dumbles was lying and manipulating all of Hogwarts the whole time. He must have known that Cedric was secretly a Nazi on the inside, and had to make sure Harry felt enough survivor's guilt to go with his big plan to take down Voldemort.
