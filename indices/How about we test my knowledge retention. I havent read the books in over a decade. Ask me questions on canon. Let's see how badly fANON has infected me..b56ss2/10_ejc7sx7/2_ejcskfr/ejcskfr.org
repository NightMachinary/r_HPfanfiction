Is super trunk real? Moody has a seven compartment trunk and if magic beasts is canon, yes.

Can magic be quantified or somehow measured? No.

Is the Trace on wands? I don't believe so.

Does Dumbledore believe in prophecy? He does not. But he knows Riddle thinks he can subvert it.

Does Dumbledore believe in Greater Good? No, this was Grindlewald's mantra.

Does Dumbledore give every Death Eater a second chance? No.

Is Dumbledore manipulative? That's a bit perspectivey.

Does the Order of the Phoenix abide by “no killing” rule? Fanon i believe. Though Moody didn't kill during first war I think as he was said to have brought in most death eaters i think.

Does Hermione worship authority and rules? No, but she does trust in adults too much.

Does Hermione always panic in a fight? No.

Does Hermione have problem producing Patronus? I do not remember. Likely yes due to it being such a difficult spell even for adults.

Does Hermione want to go with Harry to face Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest? Can't remember.

Is Ron a stupid jerk? Personally, yes.

Is Ron redundant for the Trio? No. And the golden trio is not a canon term.

Does Ron agree with Snape that Hermione is an “annoying know-it-all”? Since she was crying due to essentially calling her a swot, at one time he did.

Does Ron betray Harry after the names of the TWT are revealed? No, he's just a cunt. Though he kinda didn't tell harry about charlie and the dragons i think? Maybe a hair.

Does Ginny use love potion on Harry? No.

Does Molly use love potion on Arthur? I think she was joking with ginny and hermione.

Does Arthur really have a problem understanding the function of a rubber duck? God, that is in fanon so much but i'm sure it's asked in canon of mr granger.

Do (some) Death Eaters know that Voldemort is a half blood? The ones who knew him at hogwarts as riddle would think him a mudblood at first. His parentage mighta been leaked later but it's not ever actually mentioned in canon i believe.

Are Neville and Luna getting together? No. He marries bones's bff iirc. Luna marries rolf scamander and promptly murders him for his money then she and ginny run off togethef saddling harry with three poorly named brats while ron sells hermione to an oil sheik and promptly dies from his stomach bursting due to eating his wand thinking it was a candy one. Fleur leaves bill and consoles harry along with a pack of veela.

Wait, that's my fix it fic.

Are Ginny and Luna friends before Year 5? I feel like no. Though the families do live nearby one another.

Does Luna have seer abilities? No.
