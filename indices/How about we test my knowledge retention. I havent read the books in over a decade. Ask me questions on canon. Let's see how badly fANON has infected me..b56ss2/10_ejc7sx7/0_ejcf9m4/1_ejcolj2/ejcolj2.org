  No, it's on the residence of a muggleborn minor I think? Which is why Dobby triggered the Trace

Its actually on the underage wizards themselves, but it only reports that at the location magic has been cast near an underage wizard, it doesn't specify who used the magic or even whose trace it was. Dumbledore explain this when he mentions how Voldemort got away wit killing his family when he still had the trace.
