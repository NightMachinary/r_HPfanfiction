1.  Kind of, real Moody is in a room inside a trunk with multiple compartments. Also if you count Fantastic Beasts as canon (bleh) you can fit a whole ecosystem in a case.

2.  No, but some wizards are described as having gravitas or radiating strength (Dumbledore)

3.  No, it's on the residence of a muggleborn minor I think? Which is why Dobby triggered the Trace

4.  Kind of, he doesn't seem to think they are inevitable but rather important

5.  Hell no

6.  Nope

7.  No, like in the 7 Potters fight they shoot to kill

8.  No, she worries about expulsion but she is happy to brew illegal polyjuice and is the first to criticize Umbridge.

9.  No, she comes up with some quick strategies such as escaping from the Lovegoods' house

10. No, she easily makes a corporeal patronus in the DA

11. I don't think she is ever offered the choice

12. All teenage boys are stupid jerks. Ron is a good person in addition to being a moron at times

13. Subjective but I don't think so; he adds needed humor and Harry notes that when Hermione is your best friend, things are kind of boring

14. Before they are friends Ron calls her a know it all, which leads to the troll bathroom scene. But after, no, he gets mad at Snape over that

15. "betray"? No, he becomes frosty and distant until the first task ends

16. Ew, no

17. Probably not, Molly just mentions brewing a love potion in her youth but there's no reason to believe she used/uses them

18. Probably not, but it was a funny movie line

19. Probably yes if they knew him at school since he went home to the orphanage in his earlier years

20. No, but they should have

21. No, Ginny calls Luna "Looney"

22. Not that is shown, although who knows what she's up to off-screen
