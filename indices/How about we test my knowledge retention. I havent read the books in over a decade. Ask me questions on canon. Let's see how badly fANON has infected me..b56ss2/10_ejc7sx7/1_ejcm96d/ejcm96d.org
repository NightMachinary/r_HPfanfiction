1.  Multi-compartment trunks are real. Super trunks, complete with libraries, kitchens, and ballrooms are not.
2.  Sort of? I mean, partially successful spells do have some effect - it isn't like a true or false flag, so there is some sort of measure.
3.  No. Dobby is able to fool the trace into thinking the Hover charm came from Harry, even though Dobby doesn't use a wand. And Crouch Jr uses Harry's wand in the Quidditch WC final to cast the Dark Mark, but no letter came.
4.  Yes.
5.  Yes.
6.  He gives Snape a chance to redeem himself even though Snape hasn't done anything worthy of being given a chance. But that's just Snape. He doesn't do anything for Sirius, even though Sirius actually fought on his side.
7.  Absolutely.
8.  Probably not. When two sides fight, with lethal force being used by one side but not the other, it doesn't take long for the side with killing intent to come out on top.
9.  She does in the first few books. With each book, her belief in authority reduces.
10. No. When Dolohov begins to cast the purple curse at her, she immediately silences him - even though she forgets about silent casting, this does show remarkable presence of mind. Same with the situation in Luna's home.
11. She produces a patronus just fine inside the RoR during the DA session. She does have some trouble in the final battle though.
12. Nope. She has no idea that Harry has decided that martyrdom on the word of scum like Snivellus is a good idea.
13. Not really. He's a jerk, but the trio are all jerks.
14. No, not really.
15. Ron calls Hermione some form of know-it-all at least once a day, but he doesn't agree with Snivellus when he calls her that.
16. No. Harry says someone entered his name to try and kill him, Ron asks who, Harry gives a lame response and later calls Ron stupid. The End.
17. No...although the chest monster is dodgy.
18. Yes.
19. In the movies, he does.
20. Yes.
21. Nope.
22. Yes, they used to be friends as children.
23. No.
