1. Is Draco gay?
2. Is Harry bi?
3. After the battle of Hogwarts, does Harry testify at Draco's trial? Does he testify at any trial? Does he see Draco at his trial? Is Draco given a sentence? Is anyone given a sentence? Why does every fic include this but completely disagree on the details of it? I'm so confused here.
