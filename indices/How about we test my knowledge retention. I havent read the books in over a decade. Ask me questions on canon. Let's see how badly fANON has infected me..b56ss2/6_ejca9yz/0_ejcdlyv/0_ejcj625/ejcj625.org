Thanks. I don't think I've read a Drarry or Dramione fic set after Voldemort's defeat that doesn't mention the trial, which is weird.

Also, I'm a bit salty about the anti-Drarry / anti-slash / anti-shipping sentiment in this sub. I just find them such an amusing pair. Why the hate? I read fanfic for the romance - I find a lot of fanfic better written then most romance novels, and I like having established characters in my smut because I don't really get off until I know the characters and JK has done most of the hard work there already.

Just... Why the hate? I just want to hang out and celebrate how awesome fanfic, specifically, HP fanfic is, within an active community, but this community just downvotes Drarry so hard. Like, why the hate guys? I get that it's not everyone's thing but I can't be the only one who enjoys it? It's weird to me.

Sorry for the rant, not really directed at you, I'm just salty.
