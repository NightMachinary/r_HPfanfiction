You got Questions 1, 3, 4, and half of 9 correct. The answers I was looking for, and their common fanon alternatives, are in the spoilered section, and are as accurate to the books as far as I could make them. (I checked the books as I wrote the questions.)

I give you 3.5/9. Sorry mate, but you've been fanon'd!!!
