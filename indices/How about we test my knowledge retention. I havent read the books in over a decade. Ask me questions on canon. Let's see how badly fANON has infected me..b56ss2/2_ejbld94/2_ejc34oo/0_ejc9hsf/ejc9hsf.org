That sounds like a JKR-ism to me, since she's never been one to keep good track of times and dates... leading to Hogwarts' school year always starting on September 1, no matter the day of the week, and students are expected to get their class schedules and start classes the very next day.

It doesn't make sense to deliver Hogwarts letters to students in October, or in Hermione's case, in September. Dumbledore had trouble tracking down DADA teachers and didn't get them until July or August. They set their own textbooks, and the school supplies shopping list changed by the year depending on who was teaching. Not to mention that the letter also comes with a train ticket, giving kids who received theirs on their birthday 11 whole months to lose it.
