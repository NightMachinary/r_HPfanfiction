  students receive their letters on their Hogwarts letters on their 11th birthday does seem to line up with canon.

It doesn't. Harry got his letter on his birthday through coincidence. Uncle Vernon had been taking his letters away before Harry could read them for the whole week before, leading to Hagrid being sent to pick Harry up when Vernon took the family on the run.

  why she or her parents would voluntarily decide to send her to Hogwarts a year late.

Because the Grangers were told that Hogwarts was the best school of magic in Britain, and not studying magic was dangerous to children living in the muggle world who can't control their bursts of accidental magic.

The books make it out like the Grangers and Hermione aren't even that close, so I don't see why they wouldn't send their magical kid to magical boarding school.
