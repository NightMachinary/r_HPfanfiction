I don't know if I agree with your comment that Hermione and her parents aren't close. They're close enough that they went with her in her second year to Diagon Alley to help her buy supplies, gone camping together, went to the theatre in London (I think), and they're close enough that Hermione felt the need to protect them in the seventh book by erasing their memories of her and sending them away. That doesn't sound like a family that doesn't want anything to do with the other imo...

Honestly wouldn't surprise me if the policies of things in the wizarding world aren't enforced/enacted consistently since it's a lot of stuff for J.K. Rowling to keep track of when it comes to dates and the small details. Especially since she keeps adding more and more stuff to the world post DH, but it's her world so she can do whatever she wants with it.
