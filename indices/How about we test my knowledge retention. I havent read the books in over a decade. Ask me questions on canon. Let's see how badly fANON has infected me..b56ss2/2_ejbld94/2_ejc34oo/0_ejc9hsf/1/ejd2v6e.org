Even though I agree that a lot of Rowling's comments she releases outside of the book series are unnecessary/inconsistent, having students receive their letters on their Hogwarts letters on their 11th birthday does seem to line up with canon. Remember that Hermione was basically a year older than Harry and Ron and while also starting in the same year. If she got her letter on her 11th birthday (ie. Sept.19, 1990) she would've had to wait to the following year to start her education at Hogwarts (which she did). If she got her letter at the start of summer 1990, I can't imagine why she or her parents would voluntarily decide to send her to Hogwarts a year late.
