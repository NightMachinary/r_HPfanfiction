Eh, Hogwarts letters sometimes do come on the student's birthday. For example [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/professor-mcgonagall][Pottermore]] says

#+begin_quote
  Minerva never forgot how much her mother cried, when the letter of admittance into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry arrived on Minerva's eleventh birthday
#+end_quote

(and Pottermore further says that McGonagall's birthday is [[https://www.pottermore.com/explore-the-story/minerva-mcgonagall][October 4]]).
