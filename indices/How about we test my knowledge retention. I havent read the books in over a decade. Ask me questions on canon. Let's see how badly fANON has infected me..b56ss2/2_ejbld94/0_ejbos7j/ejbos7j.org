Yeah, Little Hangleton is not a Yorkshire place name. I like to imagine it's in Sussex, because that's where Hangleton is, but it's probably somewhere Devon/Cornwall-ish based on ruralness and middle of nowhereness?

I thought Spinner's End had been fanoned to Yorkshire despite being unknown?

I am 100% cool with everyone being in Yorkshire though.
