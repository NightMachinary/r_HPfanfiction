Hangleton is in Sussex and is pretty teeny weeny itself. Hangleton is a suburb of Hove. Also, to get little in its name and be a village you're so far out of London as to be ridiculous. Like, Greenwich Village isn't, but you're talking some Oxfordshire nonsense at the very least by the time you get far enough away.

Could be the Norwich type areas and that whole lobe to the east of London.
