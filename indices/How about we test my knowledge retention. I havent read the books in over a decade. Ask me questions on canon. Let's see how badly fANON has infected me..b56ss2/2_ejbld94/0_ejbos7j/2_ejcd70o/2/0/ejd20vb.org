Well, admittedly all I know about forest hills it that Peter Parker lived there at some point, and It sounds more like a suburb than a neighborhood to me.

And my only experience with suburbs (if I'm even right about this) is Breezedale, an old town that eventually got sucked up by Lawrence. My dad says that when his grandpa was a kid living in Lawrence he and his friends used to race to Breezedale and back on their horses when church got out. And now Lawrence has not only absorbed it, but grown past it!
