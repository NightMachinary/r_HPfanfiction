I always just assumed that Hangleton was a London suburb (like Forest Hills is to NYC, or Breezedale in Lawrence, KS) and that Little Hangleton was a suburb of Hangleton in turn. Probably because I know two British cities, London and Stepford-upon-Avon. And I'm not even 100% sure the last one is real.
