Little Hangleton is definitely not Cornwall. The name is completely wrong for Cornwall, it's not Kernowek at all. We know Little Hangleton is approximately 200 miles away from Little Whinging, which we know is near Heathrow Airport. If we draw an arc 200 miles in a circle from Heathrow, you're either in the middle of Cornwall (which we've ruled out), in the Northwest of Wales (impossible for the same reason as Cornwall,) leaving the remaining arc between just north of Liverpool to just north of Hull. So it is in northern England, and Yorkshire is probably the most well known part of Northern England, which is why most people probably place it there.
