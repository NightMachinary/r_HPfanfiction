How do we know it's near Heathrow? I thought we just knew it was in Surrey. Depending on where you place it within the county, Little Hangleton could be in Kent?

It really really doesn't sound like either a Yorkshire place or a Yorkshire place name. I mean, try saying it with a Yorkshire accent? Doesn't work at all.
