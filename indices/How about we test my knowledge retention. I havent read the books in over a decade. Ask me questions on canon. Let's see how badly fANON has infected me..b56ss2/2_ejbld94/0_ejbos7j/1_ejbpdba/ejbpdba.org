Almost every fic I've seen which uses the Riddle house, the graveyard, or the village, sets it in Yorkshire. It's become fanon'd to the extent where I think it's weird to see Little Hangleton in any other county than Yorkshire. It's probably because [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Little_Hangleton][the HP wiki page]] has an uncited statement saying Yorkshire. I'm not sure about Devon or Cornwall though, as Ottery St. Catchpole (the Weasleys' village) is in Devon.

Spinner's End is in Cokeworth, which [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/cokeworth][has a Pottermore page.]]

  Cokeworth is a fictional town in the English Midlands where Harry spends a night at the Railview Hotel with his aunt, uncle and cousin Dudley. Cokeworth's name is supposed to suggest an industrial town, and to evoke associations of hard work and grime.
