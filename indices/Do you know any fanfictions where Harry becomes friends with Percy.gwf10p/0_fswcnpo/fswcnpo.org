They're not really close, but Harry helps to avert Percy's estrangement from his family in Nightmares of Futures Past. He gives Percy more insight into why people might want to break rules to take a swing at Draco Malfoy, and gets the twins to ease up on him, as well as telling the whole family about the future war, leading to Percy helping out against Barty Crouch at the World Cup, at peril of his employment, and being comforted by his father.
