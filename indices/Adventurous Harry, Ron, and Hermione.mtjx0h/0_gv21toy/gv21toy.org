linkffn(Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis by Starfox5) has the trio going on tomb raiding adventures. It's actually a sequel to linkffn(Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider by Starfox5), which focuses on the eponymous character's adventures, but also features interludes involving the trio exploring Hogwarts.
