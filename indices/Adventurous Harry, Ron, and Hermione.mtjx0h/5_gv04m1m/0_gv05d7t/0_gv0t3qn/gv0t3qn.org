Why is it wrong that three best friends decide to pursue a romantic relationship?

You will be surprised how well poly relationships can work in real world. [[/r/askreddit][r/askreddit]] talks [[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ivbcrl/children_of_poly_relationships_what_was_it_like/][about this topic]] from time and time, and that particular thread has overwhelmingly positive replies.

In HP world, the Trio has such a deep bond that I can absolutely see a poly relationship working out well between them, perhaps even better than standalone Ron/Hermione or Harry/Hermione.
