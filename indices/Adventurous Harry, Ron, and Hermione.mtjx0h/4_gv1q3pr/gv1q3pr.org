[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12302907/1/Si-Vis-Pacem-Para-Bellum][Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum Chapter 1, a harry potter fanfic | FanFiction]]

In this fic the trio knows it gets in adventure and try to prepare for it. That means that they get willingly in a lot of adventure's. Like using the Room of Requirement as their personal portal to (I believe) Monte Carlo were they go to to have fun with Sirius.

The fic certainly get's weird but there is also a lot of drinking, adventure and slight violence....
