A lot of people consider it to be a self-masturbatory fix it fic that the author uses to explain everything he doesn't like about HP; some feel more strongly about it than others. Personally, I just don't find it gripping at all. It falls into the category of fics that I tend to avoid (anything that involves Hogwarts in some way lowers my interest quite significantly).
