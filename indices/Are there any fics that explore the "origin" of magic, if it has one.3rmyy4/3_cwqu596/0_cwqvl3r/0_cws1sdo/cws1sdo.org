it changes sharply two or three times. the first few chapters are tons and tons of exposition and a bit of funny; but if you didn't like chapter 5 where he's interacting with draco, then you probably won't like it until about chapter 30. I'm sad so few fanfic people like it, the things that are good about it are quite good. The things that are bad about it, on the other hand, are in fact really annoying. Once it gets out of the weird "teaching mcgonagall" stage, it becomes more of a typical "mary sue" thing for a while, like what you get in "summer of badassery" fics. Also, it turns out the author does, in fact, know how children work, and there is a very good reason he's a child genius. It's just not obvious at first.

As for your request, he gets into it a fair bit, but then moves on to having to actually do shit. It isn't just a "let's be nerdy in the hp universe!" fic, it's that and also "oh shit I need to actually fight".

So I dunno, I'd say read to maybe ch7 or so if you ever consider giving it a try again.

Also, is it actually the case that it's hated here?
