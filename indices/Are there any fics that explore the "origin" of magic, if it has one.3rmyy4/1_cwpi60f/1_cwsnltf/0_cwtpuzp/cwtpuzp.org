Would you be interested in having the German bits corrected? There's a few errors, f.E.

"Meister will fräulein zu sehen." should be "Meister will Fräulein sehen", at least, which is still weird enough that it probably fits the strange speech patterns everybody uses for elves.

"zu" + verb is an infinitive clause, but here "sehen" is a modal verb. In English both are constructed with "to", but in German only infinitive clauses rule "zu".
