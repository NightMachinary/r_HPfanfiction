I recall a Harry gets deaged story in which Dumbledore actually cares for Harry; he gives him the Dumbledore name. Snape likes him, but he doesn't know that it's really Harry. There's some drama when Snape finds out. Sorry, I don't recall the title and a search didn't find it. I think it was on fanfiction.net.
