Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina)

Harry's wish for a better life time travels back and changes a small detail in the marauder era. Regulus survives, learns to master Apparition and Portkeys and becomes the Black Phantom, the single vigilante anti Voldemort fighter with more success than Dumbledore's entire Order of the Fire Chicken. He constantly apparates around in the middle of every battle and summons birds to make people think that he's an animagus.
