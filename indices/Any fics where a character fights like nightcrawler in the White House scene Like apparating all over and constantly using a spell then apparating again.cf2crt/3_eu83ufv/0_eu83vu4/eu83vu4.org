  For this prompt on the kinkmeme:After the Grindelwald incident MACUSA and MoM are holding a dueling competition. Originally Newt only came to be support for his older brother and his new american auror friends. He's not comfortable at such events. Some asshole who wants to take revenge on Theseus for humiliating him the year before, thinks ge can get it by challenging Newt to fight in front of everyone. Anything goes. Before Graves can intervene, Theseus smirks and accepts the challenge for Newt.Newt procceeds to wipe the floor with him by using apparation, martial arts and an impressive list of spells, leaving everyone who was worried gaping. Theseus, proud and protective older brother that he is, admits on being responsible for the latter two.
