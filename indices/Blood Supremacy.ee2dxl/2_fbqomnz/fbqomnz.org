I think I prefer "old blood", "new blood", and something like "part blood" if it's /really/ necessary, even though it somewhat reminds me of the "part-jew" in nazi germany, something I think JKR wanted to imply. Gets rid of the strange "purity" talk, as well as the borderline slur that the word "muggle" is.

"old blood" is relatively neutral and doesn't have any strong positive or negative connotations to it (the word can mean stale, decaying, rotting, but also experienced, sophisticated and established), same as "new blood", which is at once good a word for good (new, fresh, never-before seen, innovative) and bad (inexperienced, unfamiliar, naive, etc)
