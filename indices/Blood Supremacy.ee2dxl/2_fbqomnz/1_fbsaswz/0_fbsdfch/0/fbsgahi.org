No-maj was spelled with a dash in fantastic beasts, so I just generalised that formatting. I agree it sounds a little unnatural in spoken English and the slang spelling would be different. I was pointing out there's already another canon word to describe nonmagical people, which imo could end up being the "official" or ministry way to describe them. In the real world, people use both LatinX and Hispanic to describe people from that region, but Hispanic is the term used for official records. Does that make sense?
