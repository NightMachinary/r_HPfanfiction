It's a good word on paper, but doesn't really flow all too well into spoken language, especially "no-maj", which is... really bad linguism. Like, there is nowhere that "magic" would in any way turn into "maj" in spoken language drift, it's a more complex word than before, mostly because of the "j", which becomes a sound that's very rare in american english at the end of words. Sure, "Magic" has it, but there's something hard in "Magic" that's not present in "Maj" - something which would definitely carry over and color the written term.

If the J has to be in there, then the slang term doesn't have a dash in the middle, and the first word isn't unshortened:

Muggle -> Nomaj

Oldblood -> Olmaj

Newblood -> Numaj
