I think that's the point of pureblood though. The types of people who use the terms frequently are blood supremacist and think they are better for having more magical blood. The logic, much like real world racism, breaks down once you think about it. Are you a mudblood if both or your parents are muggleborn? what if all of your grandparents are?

if in a fic you wanted to give your characters a better way of talking about magical ancestry when they aren't a particularly prejudice character i think the muggleborn/mudblood distinction is good or for purebloods saying they came from an old wizarding family world work.
