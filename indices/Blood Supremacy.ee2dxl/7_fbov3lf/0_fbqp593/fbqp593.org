good luck with that, because that's not how it works irl. Or we wouldn't STILL have a problem with racism across the entire planet.

Sure, I'd love for the world to work like that, and with continued efforts it may eventually look like that, but this kind of comment doesn't work and is counter productive. I don't know what you think, but people aren't all idiots except you - we know that it would be better, it just doesn't work.
