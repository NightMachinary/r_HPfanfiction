A Pureblood would be someone that does not have any muggle or muggle-born blood in their family tree. One site I read says "Most wizards and witches consider an individual to be a pure-blood if his or her parents and grandparents were not Muggles or Muggle-born".

So one could be a full blood without being a pureblood. If all four grandparents are magical, the person would be a fullblood, but if one of those grandparents is a muggleborn, then the person, while technically a fullblood, would not be a pureblood.
