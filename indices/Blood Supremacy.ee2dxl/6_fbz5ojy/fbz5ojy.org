I have a rather rigid headcanon on what the various terms mean exactly and when they apply. However, I also consider it completely groundless in how things actually work "scientifically" and basically only used by blood purists.

But if you want to actually use the terms to clarify which background the person have, you're basically stuck. I think the best alternative in that case that doesn't require inventing new terms is "Muggle-raised". It's also more practical since Harry, while technically a halfblood, is for all intents and purposes a muggleborn.
