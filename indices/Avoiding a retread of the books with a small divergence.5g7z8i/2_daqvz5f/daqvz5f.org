Ginny really needed a friend, so Tom exploited that vulnerability, and isolated her so that she could only rely on him.

I see Tom bribing Hermione with knowledge. He might even be able to turn her against teachers and authority figures by casting them in a bad light. Censoring knowledge, supporting a system that excludes muggleborns, creatures, etc. He might even be able to get her to do a ritual with subtle consequences that help him control/ influence her more without her realizing it.

If Tom was smart, he would have a large amount of control over her before doing the first blackout, since she'd be more likely to go to her teachers or friends than Ginny was.
