There are two ways for bits that are the same or almost the same: provide a summary after the whole thing happens, e.g. by having the characters discuss what happened, or show it all from the perspective of yet another character, one whose perspective will allow you to keep it fresh.

But there's also obviously going to be bits that are very different, and those you can put in your story with no worry.
