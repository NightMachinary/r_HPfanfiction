I agree that Harry and Ron would notice something. Especially considering how upset she'd be when she realised she might be responsible for the attacks. It wouldn't be like the time turner because the whole point of that was that it helped her hide what she was doing. If she starts looking upset and scared all the time, Harry and Ron (especially Ron) would demand to know what's going on, and I'd think she'd crack.

I think Hermione, especially at that point in the story, would also be more likely than Ginny to feel a burning need to tell a teacher. Even with the diary's influence, I can imagine her just screaming out a confession during the middle of a transfiguration lesson.

A more boring alternative is when Riddle finds out Hermione is Harry's best friend, he just manipulates Hermione to give Harry the diary ASAP and then the story become Harry with the Diary. And I don't think she'd keep it in the girl's dorms, I vaguely remember Ginny taking it with her everywhere (could be totally wrong), so I think the boys would see it.
