They spent much of that year estranged due to Crookshanks vs Scabbers, they also knew that something was up. They would notice something, that doesn't mean they would know what or why, completely different things that you can play off in different ways. If you knew that something was wrong they would investigate but if the diary was kept in the girls dorm then they would never see it, there is no evidence but it is a source of conflict. Alternatively the writer could have the diary exposed early and play off that.
