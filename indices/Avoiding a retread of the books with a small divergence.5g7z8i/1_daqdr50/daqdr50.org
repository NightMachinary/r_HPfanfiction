She's much closer to Harry and Ron, they'd notice something was wrong whereas Ginny never made friends in her first year, they all thought she was normally tired looking and obsessive about her diary. Hermione was the one to work out it was a basilisk, now personally I find it unreasonable that she was the only person to figure it out but that's what cannon suggests. We know Ginny is actually mentally quite strong so maybe Hermione is weaker and more open to possession, Tom wanted to meet Harry Potter, to talk to him, can he do that to her more often? Kill off Hermione and you have a more interesting series all round and I'd check it out. Would it drive Harry and Ron closer in their shared loss, would they split, would Harry pull the crape he pulled at Dumbledore's funeral and try to isolate himself? Come fourth year if you keep the triwizard this will affect Harry's preparation and spiral.
