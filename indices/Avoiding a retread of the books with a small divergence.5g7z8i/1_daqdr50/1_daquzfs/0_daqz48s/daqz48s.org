What you might consider is that the horcrux was made by carving up Tom's soul, his very humanity. If voldemort has no remorse/guilt/compassion etc is it because he's a natural born nut case or did they get carved off in making the horcrux. Remember how charming Tom was compared to Voldemort. If so you could diverge from cannon big time by having all the good bits of Tom in the diary but compelled to open the chamber. How are you going to get a Pyrrhic victory without someone dying, what else is the huge cost going to be? Remember a pyrric vitory is one in name only, in all other measures you lose.

Voldemort 1.0 was revived by Pettigrew escaping in the third year, if you want that accelerated Pettigrew either has to get away earlier or you need a new way of doing it. Are you going to have two Voldemorts running around, how do they interact? What real difference does any of this make. If Ron dies for the pyrrhic victory then Scabbers doesn't go back to Hogwarts so nobody notices him leave. Is that satisfying? What changes without Ron? Harry might get closer to Neville or he might go super loner, would he blame Hermione for being weak, would she blame herself? These are kids and there is a track record of leaving them alone to wallow in misery after traumatic events. How does this affect them? Hermione doesn't have the same wizarding background as the Weasley's just remember the devil's snare in Philosopher's stone, she probably wouldn't even question a diary that talks back, if anything she might look up Tom Riddle and be honoured, he would appear to be a muggleborn who became head boy and set academic records.
