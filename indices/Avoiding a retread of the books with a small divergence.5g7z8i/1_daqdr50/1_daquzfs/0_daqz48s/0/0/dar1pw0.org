Are you going to make people care about Colin first or is it just going to be thrown in first? Would have said 'us' but I filter out any stories with Hermione listed so I'll probably never read this. Two Voldemorts eh, begs the question, does Voldemort share power with anyone, even himself? You might find Tom wanting to work with Harry against Voldemort in an enemy of my enemy sort of thing where both sides know that the moment this ends they're onto each other. Would Tom's life be bound to the diary still if Colin dies? Would Tom be mortal or would the other horcruxes apply to him AND Voldemort?
