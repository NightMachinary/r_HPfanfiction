I think having two Voldemorts running around will probably be the best course of action. As for Pettigrew, I'm not sure what to do with him. For the Pyrrhic Victory scenario, I planned for Colin Creevey to be sacrificed in order to bring back Tom, which I think would make the necessary character development for Harry and Hermione happen.
