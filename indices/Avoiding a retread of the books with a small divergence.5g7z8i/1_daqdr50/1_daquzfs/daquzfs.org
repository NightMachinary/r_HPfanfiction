Hmm. This comment has given me lots to think about. I won't be killing off Hermione in my story (to be honest, I don't think I could live with myself if I killed her off). My overall plan was to accelerate the Trio's development, and create an "Empire Strikes Back" moment for the Trio. Whether or not that means that Tom wins in the end by being resurrected, or it's some kind of Pyrrhic victory for Harry, I'm still deciding.

I think the way I'm going to counter Hermione's intelligence is by making Tom act in such a way that Hermione never has a reason to think he's suspicious (after all, he's merely a discarded NEWT Charms project that gives advice to students!). Once shit hits the fan, I'd imagine Tom would then shift to blackmail to force Hermione into compliance.
