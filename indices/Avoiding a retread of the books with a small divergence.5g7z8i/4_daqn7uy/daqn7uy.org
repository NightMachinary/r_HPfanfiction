Well, first you have to decide if Hermione would try to keep the diary a secret in the first place. She's not Ginny. She is very likely to reveal the diary by asking teachers about the spells behind it. She's also smarter than Ginny - see how she solves the basilisk question - and might not drag things out that long.

Basically, it would not be a minor difference. The whole diary plot could (and maybe should) be solved far earlier.
