Consider the things that are affected by Hermione having the diary. Most obvious is her being petrified and her part in figuring out the basilisk--how much effect will Riddle have on her involvement in the trio's investigation, and how does it affect Harry and Ron's discoveries both in terms of how they discover things and when. Also consider whether Riddle could have enough effect on Hermione to keep her from suggesting the Polyjuice plan.

You could also mix up who gets petrified. Everyone was saying Harry had reason to attack people in CoS, but all the victims except Justin had connections to Ginny--she liked Mrs Norris, she was Herbology partner with Colin, and Penelope Clearwater was her brother's girlfriend. With Hermione under Riddle's control, the victims could be people she has greater connection with. That also means either finding different ways for them to only be petrified or consider the implications of having one or more students killed, both to Hermione dealing with it and how Harry is treated--being suspected of murder is a lot more serious and parents or school governors might call for his expulsion.
