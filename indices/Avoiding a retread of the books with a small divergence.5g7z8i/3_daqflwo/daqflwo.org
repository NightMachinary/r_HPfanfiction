It all comes down to how reasonable you can make it seem that Hermione wouldn't immediately tell an adult (Dumbledore, McGonnogal) about a Diary talking back to her. I guess Voldy could tempt her with knowledge at some point, but it doesn't get you over the hump of her listening to him in the first place.

It certainly wouldn't be a minor divergence though.
