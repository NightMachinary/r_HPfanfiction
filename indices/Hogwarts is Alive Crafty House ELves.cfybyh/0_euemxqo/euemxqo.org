Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Unexpected Power) Has a sentient Hogwarts. It's also got some stuff that I personally find . . . underwhelming (the protagonists are way too powerful in relation to the antagonists in pretty much every way, things in general just go too well for them for there to be any real tension, and while I might be misremembering, I'm pretty sure it does that thing where it maims minor characters in order to make it seem like the Death Eaters are more threatening than they actually are), but it was one of the first fics I ever read, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't have a bit of a soft spot for it.

I assume that its title is pretty common, so here's a direct link in case the bot goes for the wrong fic: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9444812/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Unexpected-Power]]

Edit: the bot got it right! Good bot!
