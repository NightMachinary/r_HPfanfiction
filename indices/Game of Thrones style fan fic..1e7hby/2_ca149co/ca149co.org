[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor]] Rated: M Summary: AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE.

The first one or two books probably aren't quite 'Game of Thrones-ish' but they're very good on their own and are necessary to understand the later books which assuredly contain blood, sex and politics (as well as death...) As far as families go, it features the Light and Dark pureblooded families (some new, some not). It's absolutely brilliant!
