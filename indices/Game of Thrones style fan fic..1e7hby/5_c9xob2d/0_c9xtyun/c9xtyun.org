any of them actually good? I've only tried a few Harry/Many but their plot could be summaraized as "Hermione/Dumbledore/Inheritance Managing Goblins hand over half the world and majority of England's female population to Harry. Voldermort might have been seen once getting drunk in some pub once in between all the orgies.."

If there are any fics from that genre that actually seem like someone with a brain wrote them and even try for ASOIF's power struggles and intrigues I would very much like some recommendations.
