I'm a fan of powerful!Harry fic, so my recs are always skewed that way. There's some really good action and some violence in [[http://jbern.fanficauthors.net/To_Fight_the_Coming_Darkness/index/][To Fight the Coming Darkness]]. It's a story I've read several times and like quite well.

I would also love to read a more GoT sort of Potter fic if anyone here recs one!
