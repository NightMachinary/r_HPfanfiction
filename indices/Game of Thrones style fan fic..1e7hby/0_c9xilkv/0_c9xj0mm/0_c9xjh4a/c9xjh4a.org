Well, /now/ that is true, since they've both made the leap to film/TV, where there are still relatively few fantasy options.

However, I read ASoIaF several years before I picked up the HP books (which I thought were 'for children', and as a 9th grader at the time, too immature for me). I had friends who were into epic fantasy like aSoIaF and Wheel of Time, and friends who were into Harry Potter, with very little overlap.

I was pretty turned off by the whimsical nature of magic in HP at first, but JK Rowling is an awesome writer and was thus able to win me over.
