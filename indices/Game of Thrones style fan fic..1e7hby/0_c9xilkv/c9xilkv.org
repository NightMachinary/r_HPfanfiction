I haven't seen any that really reminded me of GRRM style. I think the general cutesy-ness of JK Rowlings world and the grittiness of GRRM's world don't necessarily attract the same audience.

By the way, if you haven't read the books themselves, I highly recommend them; even more blood, sex, and politics than they can get away with on HBO. Also, the writing is really good and he switches between characters /every/ chapter, something that is pretty unique in fantasy.
