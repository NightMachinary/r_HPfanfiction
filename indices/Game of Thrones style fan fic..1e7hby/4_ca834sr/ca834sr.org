Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness trilogy sort of follows this path but not so much in the families area, the sex comes up occaisionally and politics doesn't /really/ hit until the third book.

Be warned, while it's certainly a good read it is unfinished and there hasn't been any sign of the next book in some time.
