Training I guess. When I was in primary school the kids who read the fastest got prizes. They'd give you an essay, short story etc and time you. When you're done you take a test to make sure you understand the content. One of the prizes were Donuts and I love them. I used to read constantly so I could get a donut. Which is what earned me the nickname DeDeDonuts. Which is often shortened to DeDe. I'm in my last year of highschool now but I still read a lot. If I push myself I can read about 1000 words a minute give or take 20 words. I usually read at 800 wpm though. If push it, I could probably finish all 7 in 20 hours.
