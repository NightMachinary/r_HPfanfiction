I can push 1200 wpm but definitely not at 80% comprehension, I'd say on an easy read maybe 50%, on a difficult read if I can even maintain that speed then 25%. I tend to be at 600 wpm or so normally. With Harry Potter though at one time I could read the first two books in under an hour total because I had literally read them hundreds of times and I wasn't so much as reading them as I was seeing words and remembering the next. I was a bored kid who only owned two books in English in a foreign country. Of course, now that it's been years I can't even come close to replicating that feat.
