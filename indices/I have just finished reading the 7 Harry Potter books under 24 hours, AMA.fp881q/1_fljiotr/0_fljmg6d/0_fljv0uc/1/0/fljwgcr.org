Why thank you. I'm almost 30.since I was 12 I've probably read over 75 million words of HP fanfic not including rereads. Im running out of even half decent fics to read :(

I should probably read something else than fanfic. Lol. I do sometimes. My biggest hobby is reading.

I'm so fucking glad ebooks exist. I used to lug around at least 2books a day. Maybe 3.
