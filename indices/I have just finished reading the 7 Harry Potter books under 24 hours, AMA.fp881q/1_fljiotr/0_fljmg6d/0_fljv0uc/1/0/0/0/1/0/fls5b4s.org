The Sacrifices Arc/Saving Connor series is one of the best out there. Yes, it has slash but I'll read Gen, straight, slash, femmeslash, trios.... Anything but teacher/student or cross generation romance. I hate harems but I'll read them if the rest of the fic is good or at least interesting (I'm running out of reading material).

There's a few others that I personally think are better than the books, but the sacrifices arc is simply amazing. The author warns for every instance of "graphic slash" so at least there's that if you don't like slash.
