Yes. My reading habit has almost completely shifted from books to fanfic. Currently I am trying to read a few more books again, because the physical feel of a book is just another experience. Though I have to say that I was suprised when I read some actual books again that there were fanfics which in comparison were of greater writing quality than "professionally" written pieces
