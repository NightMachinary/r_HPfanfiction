There's nothing wrong with it especially as long as your comprehension keeps up with your decoding. I just have to explain it to parents who are surprised when their kid's comprehension level doesn't match their decoding level. (Probably not your problem) :-). Personally I learned to read this way because I taught myself to read before Kindergarten and just ignored the lessons on phonics. I didn't realize what phonics was until I had to learn to teach it in college, but it solved the mystery of why my spelling was horrible.
