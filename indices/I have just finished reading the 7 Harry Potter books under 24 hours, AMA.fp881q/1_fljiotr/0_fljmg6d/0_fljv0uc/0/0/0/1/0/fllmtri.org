This is super interesting, thanks for sharing. I think literacy is the reason one of my friends who is deaf (uses cochlear implants) learned cued speech as a kid. His mom did the research and found it helped develop both speech and literacy. He also knows ASL but happens to be from a family of hearing people, so communicating in a variety of modes was important for him.
