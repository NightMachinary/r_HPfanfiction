I learnt phonics as an adults and I am convinced it has slowed down my reading, although probably increased my spelling/reading accuracy (I am/was terrible for swapping the middles of words out). I think a fear of getting things wrong/forgetting any detail has also impacted on it (and, ironically, on my memory for reading).

I'm partially deaf as well as autistic (but didn't get hearing aids until after I could read), so I simply never managed to learn phonics until I needed to in order to teach children.
