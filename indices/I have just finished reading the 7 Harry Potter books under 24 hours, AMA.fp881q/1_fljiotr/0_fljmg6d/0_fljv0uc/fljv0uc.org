I read at 1000 wpm. I've been in a medical /psychology study and that number is from theso I know it's accurate. Depending on the reading material the speed can go from 800 (dense textbook) to 1100 (childrens or YA book). All of this is with pretty much full comprehension, although at 1100+ I start to lose comprehension.

I'm pretty sure it's a savant skill, I'm autistic. I've always naturally speedread since learning how to read when I was 3. I process the words /sentences differently.

However, I didn't know I was in the top 1%. Neat!
