It means they read at a minimum 768 words per minute. The average for an adult is somewhere between 200 to 300 wpm.

Like 1% of people can read 1000 wpm or above.

So its incredibly possible to read a million words in a day. I read at around 660 words per minute.

It would take me 27 hours to read all seven books.
