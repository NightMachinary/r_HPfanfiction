Ohh, I'm on the second short story collection right now! I've been at that place since January, admittedly, but once term's done I plan to pick it up again. I've watched the TV show (how I got into it in the first place) but other than that I know nothing about them. I'm looking forward to a mostly-unspoiled epic fantasy story. I don't think I've gotten into a new one since I burned through all the published ASoIaF novels in 2011
