Way back when, someone did a comparison of Harry's yeargroup to the 1991 census. It's basically perfectly representative of the UK in 1991 in terms of ethnic and geographic diversity. Even Padma and Parvati, as twins, fitted in a weird way, because to be perfectly representative there should have been more than one (but less than two) British Asian (in the UK sense, not the American sense, before anyone gets confused) students. Higher proportions of non-white students would have implied that magic was not evenly distributed through the population, and right now you'd have people complaining about exoticism and JK Rowling implying that POCs have magical powers or are closer to nature. What Hogwarts looks like is like random children were chosen from across Britain, with every child equally likely to be picked.

Americans just assumed it was artificially homogeneous because it didn't reflect the demographics of America.
