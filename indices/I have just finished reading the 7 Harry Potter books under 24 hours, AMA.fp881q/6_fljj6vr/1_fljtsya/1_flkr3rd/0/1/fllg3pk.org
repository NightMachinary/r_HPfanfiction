Interesting that someone looked this up; I've had almost exactly the same discussion with rl friends regarding this and that often criticisms ask for a greater representation of US-demographics than those of the UK at that time, and to a lesser extent now.

That's without taking into account that wizarding families are often from rural areas.

Of course, it should mean that the demographic in Albus Severus' year looks different to that of Harry's.
