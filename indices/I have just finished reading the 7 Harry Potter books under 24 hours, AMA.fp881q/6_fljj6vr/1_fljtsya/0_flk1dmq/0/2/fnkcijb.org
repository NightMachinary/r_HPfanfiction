Went to school in Texas. It was still widely used in every school near me, including my own. They were called "swats" which was done with a wooden paddle with holes. I had to get them for tardis in place of going to detention for 2 or 3 weeks after school. You had to have a witness in the room while they were done to you. I suppose it was to ensure that you weren't getting the shit kicked out of you. So, I had the sweetest and kindest older lady counselor looking right into my eyes while I got about 10 swats.

I couldn't put my ass directly on the chair afterwards for a few days, but I remember it feeling worth it at the time to be able to hang out with my friends before I had to go to work after school instead of sitting in detention for weeks.
