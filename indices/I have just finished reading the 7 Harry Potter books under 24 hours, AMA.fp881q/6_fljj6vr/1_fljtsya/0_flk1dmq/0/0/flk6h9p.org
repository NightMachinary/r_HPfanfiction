Wow. Seriously? It hasn't been legal in public schools for at least 30 years where I'm from (Argentina), because it definetely wasn't when I was in primary school, although I /know/ for a fact my father went to a catholic school that still used corporeal punishment in the 60s. I just cannot image it being legal in 2020, it just boggles my mind.
