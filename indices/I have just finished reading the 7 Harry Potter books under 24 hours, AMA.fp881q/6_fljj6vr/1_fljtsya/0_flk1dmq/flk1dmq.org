Agreed! Some years ago, I discovered that corporal punishment wasn't publicly banned in schools until 1986 in Britain. This blew my mind. It was still allowed in private schools until the late 90s and until the early 2000s in Scotland and Northern Ireland.

OOTP was set in 95-96. JK has said that Hogwarts is NOT a private school and that tuition is free, but the letter of acceptance and boarding aspects of the school are generally private school practices. By that logic, it wouldn't have been long since they were allowed to implement whipping as a punishment in public schools. However, we know that Dumbledore never allowed “the old punishments” which were far more torturous. I would imagine he felt similarly about whipping, the most widely accepted form of corporal punishment, which is why Filch and Umbridge would be excited about getting the Approval for Whipping form.
