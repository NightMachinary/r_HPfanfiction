I am finishing with OotP, and you know what is treated surprisingly lightly? Whipping students! Filch makes comments throughout the books about chaining students, whipping them and such. Like, WTF? When the twins set the swamp on Umbridge and then leave Hogwarts, we see Filch giddy that she had signed a form to allow the whipping of the twins. I am truly disturbed by this...
