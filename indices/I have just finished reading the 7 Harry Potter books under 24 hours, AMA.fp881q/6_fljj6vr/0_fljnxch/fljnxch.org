Definitely most disturbing was the approach to love potions.

Not only are they sold to the general public, not classified as dark magic or anything or even a restricted substance, not only is Amortentia taught in Potions, but most importantly there is just no social stigma around them. Nobody really cares that Romilda chucks love potions around, being drugged is apparently ok in this society. The Imperius is unforgivable, but love potions are fiiiiine.

Also, in CoS on Valentine's day, Lockhart mentions that Flitwick is really handy with 'intoxicating' (not sure about the precise translation) spells. Basically Rohypnol from a wand.
