I just re-read this scene to get a sense of it all, and I think it's definitely possible that Lockhart, who thinks it's totally fine to erase people's memories and take credit for their work, is also totally fine with Flitwick's Entrancing Enchantments, but I don't think there's enough to show that Flitwick himself necessarily shares this view. For example, he could know about them for purely academic or even counter-charm purposes, but not use or condone their use. Or he could be embarrassed at Lockhart's "compliment", or anywhere in between. Either way, I don't think this scene says much about Flitwick except that he knows a lot about the subject he teachers.
