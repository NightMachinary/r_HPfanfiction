I forgot about most of the random stuff Lockhart spouts, as well as how he had Harry play the roles of characters from his books, that was fun to be reminded of.

​

My favourite book is probably HBP - not much for the teenage drama, but I really enjoy getting to know Voldemort through memories, how they always have a different perspective. Seeing that for Hitler would be awesome.

​

My least favourite - at least from my current point of view of someone who knows the books quite well - is the first book. Not much happens throughout the whole book, it mostly focuses on worldbuilding which is unnecessary once one knows the world and overall... It's of course great when you're 8, but it really is more of an introduction.
