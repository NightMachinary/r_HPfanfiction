I definitely forgot just how much space both Hagrid and Peeves get in canon.

Hagrid especially surprised me, as in fanfiction (at least in my experience) he gets sidelined a lot, but I would wager that he is easily the most present, most talked with adult, at least in the first four books.

And Peeves is just eveeerywhere, I am now even more baffled by his exclusion from the movies. Peeves is always doing something, throwing stuff, singing catchy tunes - I reckon he gets more exposure than Dumbledore until book 6.

I also somehow managed to forget just how awesome Mr. Weasley is. Honestly, what a guy.

As to the change in opinion - I honestly started quite liking Rita Skeeter. She is just... good at what she does, she likes to do it, she doesn't mind the hate... I would classify her as a Chad.
