  As to the change in opinion - I honestly started quite liking Rita Skeeter. She is just... good at what she does, she likes to do it, she doesn't mind the hate... I would classify her as a Chad.

See, this is what makes Rowling Rowling and not some fanfic author - a lot of people predicted that Snape had been in love with Lily, but no one predicted that in the middle of Voldemort taking over the world Rita will publish a trashy biography of Dumbledore.
