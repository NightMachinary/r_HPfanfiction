See I see the daily prophet as a tabloid, similar to the daily mail here in the UK. Yes Katie is a total troll but her attitude and beliefs and the way she speaks is very similar to how I imagine Rita to go at.

Actual broadsheets in the UK are for example the Guardian or the Financial Times. Considering the crap the Prophet put Harry under I can't imagine it as anything but a tabloid tbh.
