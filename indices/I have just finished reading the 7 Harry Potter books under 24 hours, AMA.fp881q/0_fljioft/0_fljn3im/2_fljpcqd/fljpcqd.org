I'm trying to not reread the series currently so I can forget as much stuff as possible and try re-experience the books as much as possible, but what with studying and whatnot and cancellation of exams I'm free again, and I forgot just how much I love Peeves until you mentioned his name again.

This is probably a bit common but I've never not loved Rita as a character. She just fits the role of a gossip mongerer very well; definitely one of the characters that makes the series stand out for me.
