If the focus is on the quidditch match itself and not other elements happening during the match (the players, the crowd, politics, etc.) then I think you need to change the snitch scoring. I personally cannot get invested in the intricacies of quaffle play knowing that it all comes down to the snitch anyway. So in canon its either an over 150 point blowout and the snitch doesn't matter or everything that comes before the snitch catch is essentially irrelevant. You could argue that a team trying to stay within 150 points matters, but in that case you could still lower snitch points and achieve the same result without the massive imbalance. Unless of course you are trying to show that Harry or whoever is basically carrying the team to victory by themselves.

The other way I've seen to avoid this is a heavier emphasis placed on total scoring in terms of league position and goal differential. So teams are still working for every goal because it might affect their seeding or toward the House Cup at school. The problem is this becomes a little dry for fanfiction readers many of whom I'm guessing aren't big sports fanatics. There's a bit in the books about Harry only catching the snitch when they're up by a certain number of points but that's as detailed as it gets.
