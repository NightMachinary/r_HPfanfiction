Based on the reviews I received for a fictional group stage of the 1994 World Cup, people liked it when you:

- Write the commentary, only use the character viewpoint to put emphasis on a couple scenes (use radio commentary for football as an example)

- Keep things simple. Even if you make the Quidditch pitch 200 yards long, the players will cross it in a couple seconds. A firebolt can do nearly 300 kph.

- Stick to known terminology. No one will know what an Takeshi play is supposed to be, but terms like cross, pass or shot are well known.

- Write multiple shorter (1k words) matches instead of one long one. Things get repetitive otherwise.

- Try to give each team an individual character. One might have excellent team work but is lacking on the technical side, the next one has a superb keeper but otherwise mediocre players, one might have perfect offensive plays but suck at defending and so on. Also think how these would interact with the opposing team.
