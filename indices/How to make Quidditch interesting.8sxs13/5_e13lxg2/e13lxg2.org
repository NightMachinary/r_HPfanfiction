I personally don't think any sport translates to text particularly well. Quidditch in particular is as much a spectacle as is it a sporting event. For something to be interesting we need to care about it, it needs to be made important to us. There needs to be stakes. Why should we care about the result of a quidditch match? I don't think its possible to capture the atmosphere of a live match in text form. Quidditch is quidditch I don't think the rules need changing but I struggle to think of a story that features sport as anything other than a plot device.
