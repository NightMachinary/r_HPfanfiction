Several fics show Harry in a different position, usually chaser (ex. HP and the Prince of Slytherin).

Other fics toy with the rules of quidditch (ex. The Quidditch World Cup, Vitam Paramus, The Firebird's Son: Book 1 of the Firebird Trilogy), including seekers being more involved or beaters being able to contact other people.

The reason quidditch is often boring is because in canon the actual matches are ways of setting up /other/ plot points. In PS, making it appear like Snape is cursing Harry's broom (red herring #1). In CS, Harry's arm is broken so he can spend the night in the hospital wing where he speaks to Dobby for further exposition and sees the next petrified person.

The point is, quidditch seems to be best when it is serving to advance another part of the story.
