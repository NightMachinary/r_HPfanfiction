the thing is, I love a fic with a good romance subplot. I swear they used to be everywhere, but now it's either "genfic with no romance at all" or "basically just a romance fic" with no in between. I don't think it helps that I want my fic to go in the m/m direction either, given that that alienates fics even more for a lot of people. this isn't just for hp fics necessarily, just something I've noticed in fandoms in general. oh well. I just want to write it for myself more than anything, and if it makes even a few people happy, that's all I could ask for.
