Well, the thing is fanfiction in ye olden days (+15 years ago) was much more segregated than it is today, with sites like say the die hard Sink Into Your Eyes for H/G fans. This meant pairing was usually how people actually looked for fanfiction (and indeed this often why people get into ff in the first place).

Fast forward to today, now most of these have shutdown and agglomerated into a handful of broader websites like [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] and [[https://archiveofourown.com][archiveofourown.com]], with a few broader niches like DLP, spacebattles and sufficientvelocity holding out as commentary/critique sites and forums. Thing is though, most people get into and stay in the fandom mainly for the cliches and pairings, which is why the primary search category ends up being pairing, characters, and genres.

By the time they have 'grown' beyond just looking for pairing, 90% of people have lost interest and/or moved onto other fandoms to do...well basically the same thing. This makes gen fics difficult to get readership in general, because most gen fics are more like actual novels than the bulk of the pairing/character/wish-fulfillment fics I just mentioned. Those are, if anything, more analogous to trashy romance novels you see at airport stalls and trucker stops.

*And no, I don't mean this to offend people who like or read pairing exclusive stories*. Its merely an observation born from the trends in this and other fandoms, not meant as derogatory against peoples' individual tastes.
