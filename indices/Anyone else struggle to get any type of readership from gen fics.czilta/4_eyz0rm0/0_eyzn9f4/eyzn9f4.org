It's also because when a fic doesn't focus on pairings, it has to rely on the skill and originality of the author to carry it. A task that many fanfic writers are not up to. This is by no means me throwing shade at any authors on the sub, just a comment on Sturgeon's Law in general. I myself have a few incomplete fics out there that are just crap.
