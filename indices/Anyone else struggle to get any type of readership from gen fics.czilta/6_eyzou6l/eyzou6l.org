Hi [[/u/hava_97]]! I've read this fic and I've commented on it before! You're a great writer, and it was pleasant to read (in terms of spelling, grammar and style). From what I remember of this fic, for me the issue was that Lily... Was disappointing. She's the woman who defeated Voldemort and yet she lets Narcissa Malfoy push her around like some kind of Mean Girl. She tells her son to stay out of trouble and not fight against blood purism.

Another thing I rather disliked is that the "racist" characters in the fic, Narcissa and Draco, seem to be shown to having a rich inner life. An inner life that the narrative respects, if not the protagonists. It's just not my cup of tea, I much preferred J K Rowling making these characters look ridiculous (as well they should be given their ideology). This is just my preference, I wouldn't take it as an indicator of the quality of the fic.

For me, having one of Harry's parents survive would change so much. And you have changed so much, its not nearly as bad as that Everybody Lives series. But I just see certain things as being that way for the sake of dramatic tension and it grinds my gears. I guess the feeling of not being listened to or thought delusional (Lily believing that her other son survived) is a rich well for tension and drama but for me it just makes me mad.

I bookmarked it and resolved to read it again when it was finally complete. Because at the stage the fic was in when I first read it, it was just too annoying to me.
