heya! I remember you! you gave me a bit to think about then when you commented, and even more now! I'll definitely give what you've said a good think through, I think i just didn't develop lily's side of the story very well, because I totally see your points. I focused much more on her sons' stories when i was planning it, plus this is my first time trying to write a big fic, so there were bound to be weaknesses. thanks for giving me some great feedback!
