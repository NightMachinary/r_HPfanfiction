Yeah, I have a Hermione/Tonks oneshot and it was not very popular on FFN. It used to be my only fic more successful on Archive until TemporalKnight came along and promoted it in a chapter of "Potters against the world". That were a few fun days with a hundred emails each.

Also, I'm glad you enjoy my other fics.
