  Ao3 is not a place where you will get a lot of attention. I have a fic called "No Longer Alone" on FFN where it sits at 260k hits and 2200 follows. On Archive, it has 4200 hits and 115 kudos. That's simply the nature of Ao3.

To be fair, although I am much more active on AO3, I follow a lot of recs from this sub to FFN, and your fic was one of them. The AO3 Harry Potter fandom is 1/4 the size of the FFN fandom by fic count, and as you noted elsewhere a lot more of it leans queer. But there is a lot of discussion under the fics I read and follow.

I really like this fic, and I'm gonna give it a re-read to catch myself up soon.
