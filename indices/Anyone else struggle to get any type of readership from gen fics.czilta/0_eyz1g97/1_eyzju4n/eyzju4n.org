  Ao3 is praised for its culture of dialogue, but I have yet to find evidence of it even existing.

My experience is extremely similar to yours. I get way more feedback from FFN, and when I reply to reviews about half the time they respond back. On AO3 I get about a tenth of the response and no one has replied yet.
