Ao3 is not a place where you will get a lot of attention. I have a fic called "No Longer Alone" on FFN where it sits at 260k hits and 2200 follows. On Archive, it has 4200 hits and 115 kudos. That's simply the nature of Ao3.

I had two PM exchanges on archive which resulted from reviews, and both times it was me reviewing other stuff. Meanwhile, on FFN each update gets me a few PMs. Ao3 is praised for its culture of dialogue, but I have yet to find evidence of it even existing.

Are not a guarantee for success, unless it's a popular queer pairing because that's where the reader-base is to be found. Although I think that this is more to the fact that Ao3 allows you to search for F/F fics as well as specific pairings, which makes it a lot easier to find rarepairs.
