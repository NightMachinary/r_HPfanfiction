From what I can remember of fic site statistics, I feel like AO3's readerbase is more skewed towards pairing-centric fiction, and romance fiction will therefore get more readership and traction. (It's just a mad theory of mine, but I think being able to very easily filter characters and pairings seperately makes the pairing-minded more likely to use AO3 over other sites with different navigation structures.) Try not to compare your fanfic to stories in different genres, since those genres will have different levels of popularity. I agree with other posters here that crossposting to fanfiction.net might help, since I personally am a gen fan and find most of my favorite reads there as well.
