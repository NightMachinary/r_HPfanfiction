While I haven't posted any of my fanfics on the web yet, I myself don't read gen anymore (I started out with fictions considered that in the early 2000's, but I've since then matured a bit ;) and just like relationships are the spice in real life, I like them in my fiction now, too - but I don't want them to take center-stage at the expense of everything else...just like with spices: Put too much in and the food tastes like garbage and is worse than bland food without spices!)
