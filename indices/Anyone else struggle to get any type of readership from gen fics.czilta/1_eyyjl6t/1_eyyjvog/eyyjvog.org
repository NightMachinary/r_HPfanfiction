that's a good idea actually. I haven't been in this sub for long, so I didn't know if it was okay to do (as I said, noob). thanks for responding! I'm gonna have another look at the plot plans for now (I spent a few months away from the fic and only just got back) so I think I'll just draft up a bit more and add the tags once I'm 100% sure of the direction I'm going in.
