Try promoting it here? I have searched by ship before so gens wouldn't come up. What I really care about is /avoiding/ ships so if I think a fic just has untagged ships I might skip it for that reason... I once came across a fic that was MARKED HHr where Dramione happened.

I have read quite a few gen fics that were recced here or in the discord though. I particularly like when people rec stuff on the discord and I can just ask questions, or more often, read the answer because someone else has already asked.
