I suppose my romance story gets proportionately more views but that's coming from an extremely low base. Romance is somewhat more popular than gen, but I don't think it makes as much difference as people say. I struggled to get much attention on any of my fics and I don't expect it to change now. Sadly, I think it's my writing people don't like.
