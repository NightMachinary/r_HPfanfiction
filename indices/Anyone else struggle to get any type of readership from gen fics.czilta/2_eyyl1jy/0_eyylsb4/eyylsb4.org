yeah that's a good idea. I'll tag them as slow burn, given that someone else said that some people will skip fics if they're worried a pairing they don't like will show up. thanks!

I've actually cross posted to ffn already, and it's got slightly better results there. I'll just have to keep going with it and see where it ends up. :)
