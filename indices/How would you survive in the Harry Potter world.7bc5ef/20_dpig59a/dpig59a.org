Assuming it's also 1991, I stay mostly hidden in the background at Hogwarts while trying to confirm all those fan theories about ways wizards could make money. After 5th year, I /nope/ my way back to the USA, take whatever money I've earned from my schemes and invest it into Google, Apple, Facebook, Twitter, etc.

Wizards can go die in a hole, for all I care. I'm going to play the part of a rich muggle.
