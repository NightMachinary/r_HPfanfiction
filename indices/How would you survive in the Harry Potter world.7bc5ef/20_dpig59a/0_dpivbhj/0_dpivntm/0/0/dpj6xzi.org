Can you tell I'm not an experienced investor? And that I was only born in '96? The concept of financial experience doesn't really even start for me until '08.

So within the context of the prompt, I'd use those years in the 90's to build up my magical skill and baseline capital before seriously investing in the early 2000's using observations from 2008 onwards.
