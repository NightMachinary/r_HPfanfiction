Fics of this sort are written, they're called self-inserts(SI). They're awful, as you might expect.\\
It is an interesting scenario to think about though, I did it a lot when I was young. Harry Potter offered me an escape from my life growing up. Some of the first things I ever did on the internet were seeking out information about Harry Potter, and finding communities that grew up around the mutual love for the series.

To answer your question; I'd go to Hogwarts, tell Dumbledore everything, then I'd be a wizard. I suppose being forced to go through adolescence a second time would be a fair punishment for such a reward.
