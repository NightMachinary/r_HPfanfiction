People here have the need to constantly mention how stupid they find an idea/premise. It's rather annoying seeing the title of a post, seeing that there's comments, assuming they're recommendations, but instead just seeming somebody saying that the type of story OP is looking for is stupid and terrible.

EpicBeardMan answered OP's question though, so I think he's fine.
