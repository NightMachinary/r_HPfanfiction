I stay in England and go to Hogwarts. I try to find Harry on the train and get him to join Slytherin(my house) and befriend me(the kid has no experience with friends so it would be easy). Later I get him to help me steal the philosophers stone without telling him what it is( I could beat every obstacle except the mirror and thats why I need Harry) then I would flee the country now rich and immortal and go to Durmstrang to finish my magical education. now I would anonymously send Dumbledore an Owl containing a letter that tells him about Quirrel, about Sirius and Pettigrew and about the locations of the horcruxes, warn him about the ring, tell him about the chamber of secrets and harry being a parselmouth and a horcrux.

Now I am at one of the best magical schools in europe learning to be an awesome wizard, am incredibly rich, immortal and Voldemort is dealt with. But I would feel pretty guilty, because Harry is most certainly going to permanently die.
