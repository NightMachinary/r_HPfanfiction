Get sorted into Slytherin and become the ultimate double agent.

Actually that sounds like too much work. I'd probably want to get sorted into Ravenclaw to stay a bit off the radar. I'd definitely want to learn occlumency asap. And then I'd */ransack/* the Room of Requirement, because can you imagine all the cool shit that's in there? All the while I'd be subtly helping the "good guys".
