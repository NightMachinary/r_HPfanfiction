I'd try to learn occlumency and the patronus charm as soon as I could, then I would try to find a way to be immune to memory charms, if occlumency doesn't do that.

After that, I would try to learn every protective enchantment that I could, including the fidelius charm, then build a little hidy hole, buy a house elf, and then try to stay safe for the rest of my life.

Thats assuming that I'm a wizard. If I were a muggle, I'd be fucked.
