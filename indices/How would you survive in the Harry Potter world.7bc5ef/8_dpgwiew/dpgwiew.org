get sorted into hufflepuff. don't need syltherin / gryffindor drama and fuck ravenclaw because im not going to join a house with a riddle-me-this door.

use anonymous letters through my bank to offer to sell dumbledore the info I have on voldemorts horcruxes. probably 200 galleons or so.

invent something that can be the basis for a good business. this entirely depends on what magics are available to learn. GTFO by moving to america before the battle of hogwarts.

if i can't move to america i'll probably just live in the room of requirement for a few years.

my invention... im thinking wizard computers. a logic gate is a logic gate whether it's ropes and pulleys, electricity, or magic. either that or study how a pensive is made and create a gaming-pensive and game-creator suite.
