Writing a fanfic about just that at the moment ([[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/wandless-hp-si.42588/][Wandless by fflai (SV)]]), will release Chapter 2 this evening.

I won't spoil the plot here, but definitely going to Hogwarts. Would you really turn down the chance with all your knowledge about England? You don't know if Magical Germany is better at all, for example, it might be horrible! And contrary to fanon, Dumbledore isn't evil, he just makes mistakes that can probably be avoided.

Generally the genre of "Self Insert" fanfics is what deals with that, sadly there are only like 5-10 good ones in the HP fandom, a recent recommendation thread is [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/70zyai/selfinsert_fics/][this one]].

My personal recommendations are (in order):

- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/wand-hp-si.4477/][Wand by Hiver (SV)]] - while his spelling and grammar isn't always the best, hiver writes very fun stories, that feel authentic - his OC simply feels alive.

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8586147/1/][A Curse of Truth by butalearner (FFN)]] - it's also a nice fic, canon-like universe and a paranoid author. The ending could be a bit better, but I really liked the story.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-perks-of-survival-hp-si.311621/][The perks of Survival (SB)]] - the premise is awesome, the worldbuilding was also intersting in this one, but IIRC it is a bit of a different universe.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11691332/1/][So How Can I Weaponize This? by longherin (FFN)]] - fun fic, fun premise, but not exactly Harry Potter universe again.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12369247/1/Triumphant-the-Dreamer][Triumphant, the Dreamer by Shadowblayze (FFN)]] - "Big Sister of Harry"-SI, it's a rather fun story, even if the insert is definitely the biggest Mary Sue ever. Still fun for a while, don't judge me.

These are best ones that came to my mind, so I hope you might like this in addition to the discussion.
