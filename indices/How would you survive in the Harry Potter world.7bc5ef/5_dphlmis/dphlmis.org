I'd probably be "fuck yeah" and imagine myself being super studious or something since magic is so interesting, and I'd be the next Minister of Magic, or Voldemort, or Dumbledore or some shit that is recognized and powerful and renowned everywhere.

But then I'd realize I'm just the same exact person and magic is not that much interesting when it involves study and I'd just become some mundane, regular, uninteresting teen that probably couldn't summon a patronus before having sex and I'd reach 17 year old wondering what the fuck to do with my life.
