Go to hogwarts get into ravenclaw if the sorting hat takes requests and keep to myself to change canon as little as possible while exploiting the Room of Requirement for all its worth Till fourth year we're I make my first change by poisoning Cedric before the third task with a non leath poison that will slow him down so Harry is the only one to make it to the cup at the centre of the maze.

Then hope that my time abusing the Room of Requirement over the first four and a half years has been enough to make a difference.

It fifth year I would be a background member of the D.A. And make my second big change by make Umbridges trip into the forbidden forest at the end of the year fatal and have her death blamed on the the giant spiders to give a reason for them to be exterminated before the final battle.

After sending Umbridge for her date with the acromantula I would take the knight bus to London and then make my way to the ministry sneak into the department of mysterys and then when the death eaters split up to hunt Harry and his friends take out the death eater one by one using a combination of stealth liquid luck and silent casting to hit each in the back with an invisible spell of my own making.

As you can tell I am aproching combat from the mindset of Squad two from bleach:

"If your comrade is being defeated, you should see it as an opportunity. Rather than standing in the way, you should stab the enemy in the back".

Or at least the first half of it
