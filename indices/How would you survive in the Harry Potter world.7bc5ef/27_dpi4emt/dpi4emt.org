Well, with your particular set-up, I'd check the year and decide based on that. But unless it was extremely inconvenient (such as being 11 in 1996 or 1997, which would basically make me dead weight), I'd go, for reasons that I feel should be fairly obvious (check flair if in doubt), though I doubt I'd be very involved since I know the whole thing ended up alright and I wouldn't want my involvement to break stuff.

Now, it gets funnier if it were the actual 11-year-old me who learned that she was a witch, because the me at that age would survive “barely” but it would definitely be an interesting ride. Assuming that I'd get to get involved with the plot it would lead to some “canon fixing” because even at that age there were certain ... parts of my character, that would have caused some changes, such as the fact that even then I knew better than to sign something without learning what exactly it does (think of the DA parchment, and how it would go if people knew it was cursed before they signed it), and the fact that I had some ... issues, that I had to work through but really wouldn't be able to in the wizarding world and that would probably end up traumatising someone a bit (imagine year 6 with an addition of a girl who was willing to love potion herself and point herself at Harry in order to understand what love is, only she would do it after asking Harry if he blamed someone for doing something when they couldn't control themselves because they drunk a weird potion). Probably wouldn't get involved with the plot at all during the last year, as I'm way worse at having the courage to stand up for myself than I do for others (the latter of which would require going on the camping trip, but an underage character they need not), but instead would go stealth amidst the muggles, though that could be of use to the trio for obvious reasons (a potential safe place) so that too, though minor involvement, may change something.

I'd probably cause many a character to want to stun me whenever they see me, on principle.
