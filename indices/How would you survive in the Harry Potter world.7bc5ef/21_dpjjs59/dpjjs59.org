How it likely will go down:

I arrive in North Korea with no kind of communication to the wizarding world.

Because a ‘magic pub' is probably easy to find.

Don't find it, get stabbed and sold to some brothel because I neither have any ID nor do I have enough money(because I am 11) and can't pay for housing.

..................................................................................................................................................................................................

How I would like it to go down:

First Year: I arrive in my London and get to Kings Cross station, as it is the only landmark that I can find in Muggle London.

I go through the ‘portal' and find someone that can take me to Diagon alley.

Getting to Diagon alley, I search for a way to send an owl.

Having sent an owl, I hope for someone of the staff at Hogwarts to meet me.

Go on the Shopping tour, can't buy anything extra and only second-hand things.

Wait for September 1:st, during waiting time learn some ‘fire' magic that can be fired of quickly. Earn some money through safe bets, like calling my parents and asking for some. (Also when I'm talking to them, perhaps explaining what is happening. Let the ‘magical' of my parents explain to the other..)

Start by getting sorted into Slytherin for my first plan to work.

Because of previous knowledge, I avoid Harry Potter as much as possible, in order to preserve knowledge about the future.

Let Harry deal with the ‘Snape is evil, we must stop him' farce.

When Quirrel is dead and lessons start again, wait until we perform the ‘small creature into matchboxes' transfiguration. Set Pettigrew aflame. Offer to buy him a new rat if caught. If not caught, imply it being Seamus Finnigan's fault. Malfoy will probably help fuel this fire as Finnigan is a half-blood.

..........................................................................................................................................................................................

Second Year:

I can't deal with the Basilisk so Ginny will be the next point to strike.

Steal the diary.

‘Accidentally' get sent to the Headmaster's office whilst carrying the book.

Get him to notice the diary, he will hopefully recognise it. If not, get it back to Ginnys possession.

Let Harry deal with the Basilisk problem. ...........................................................................................................................................................................................

Third Year:

Unlikely to happen, but if Sirius still escapes:

Have the fat lady torn.

Make an effort to make Harry go into the Forbidden shack, when it is not a full moon.

Like a surprise attack by a crazy madman, that has kidnapped Ron to make Harry go to the Shack. (Ron is just stupefied somewhere in the garden outside of the Hogwarts walls, so the Marauders map can't see him). .........................................................................................................................................................................................

Fourth Year:

Unknown if Voldemort is acting behind the scenes during the Triwizard tournament.

Use a wait and see approach.

Harry is not the extra champion. Good. Do nothing. Harry becomes the extra champion. Bad. Do something.

Check Moody. It's unlikely I could get the hip-flask, so main focus is the first DaDa lesson. If the same, not Moody. If changed, maybe Moody.

If the Tournament gets to the labyrinth, get them to change the last task. If unchanged. Get an unbound portkey and bind it to the spot the trophy will be and the front of the stands. Use a broom and fly over to the trophy. Leave your portkey, take trophy.

Here there is two options: 1) I get to meet Voldemort. Hurray! Death if I don't use the portkey again. Continues in 2) I am portkeyed in front of the stands with an audience watching me. Being expelled is the only reasonable conclusion to this. ......................................................................................................................................................................................

The world is saved. Now all I need to do is find them horcruxes.

I can't get them so I have to hope Dumbledore believes me when I tell him that they exist.

After they are done, I finish my schooling and get a job as a clerk in some store.
