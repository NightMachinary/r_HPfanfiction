The outcome if I do nothing is pretty good. Some deaths, yes, but the result could be a lot worse. That good result came about as the result of a long string of relatively unlikely events, the occurrence of which sits on a knife edge. Any small change could very easily derail the whole sequence of events which resulted in victory.

You'll probably do the world a favour by refusing to meddle. Not to mention your own life expectancy.
