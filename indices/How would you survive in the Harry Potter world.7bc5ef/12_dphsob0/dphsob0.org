Be sorted into Hufflepuff. I was sorted into Hufflepuff on Pottermore and in most sorting quizzes I'm sorted into Hufflepuff, plus I'd be away from the drama of Gryffindor/Slytherin and as much as I hate to say it I don't think I'm smart enough for Ravenclaw.

Befriend Susan Bones who is the niece of Amelia Bones, a woman who from just the few moments with her seems pretty strict but fair in the terms of justice. I'll tell Amelia about the Horcruxes, about Sirius and Peter and everything else.

And then once I tell Amelia I'll likely tell Albus, but I'll only tell him after I tell Amelia, always good to have back up help. Trusting Rowling's writing I'll say that he believes me, I could always be given Veritaserum as well, that way he'll have to believe me.

Try to help Dumbledore with Barty Crouch Jr, Sirius and Peter. Make sure there's no way that Harry can do the tournament. If he somehow does end up doing the tournament even though hopefully by that time Barty Crouch Sr and Jr are in Azkaban, I'll need Amelia and Albus' help making sure the portkey doesn't go to the graveyard.

I'll learn Occlumency, help Harry and co out with spells and training. Maybe even start up Dumbledore's Army early on. Quirrell is awful in first year, Lockhart is no better. Umbridge is horrible, and if Barty Crouch Jr is in Azkaban at this point and Dumbledore gets Mad Eye Moody I'm not too sure how he'll do teaching students, it would be great to be able to keep Remus since he is the only good Defence Professor, but if I can't I'll help Dumbledore find a good Defence Professor.

Make sure that the Horcruxes are destroyed, find a way to destroy the Horcrux that is inside Harry so that he doesn't have to be killed. And for something minor find a way to get rid of that annoying portrait of Sirius' mom. Although hopefully at this point Sirius is out of Azkaban, raising Harry someplace else entirely and it is unplottable.
