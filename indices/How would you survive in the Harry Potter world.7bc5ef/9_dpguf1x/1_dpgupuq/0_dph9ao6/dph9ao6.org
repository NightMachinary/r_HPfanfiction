High up on my priority list would be to find it how much of fanon is canon, as that would decide what I do. But if want to be in the middle of it, probably in Hufflepuff it ravenclaw and with on inter house unity, as well as teaching muggleborns pureblood traditions, and purebloods about the achievements and dangers of the muggle world. I'd want to learn occulamcy before getting anywhere near Snape or Albus (or Quirellmort). Ideally I'd be at least a few years older than the golden trio, and if I was my current age I'd want to be the muggle studies teacher and change things as a teacher.
