I'd stay in England, try to get sorted into Griffindor but probably end up in Hufflepuff any way. I'd try to befriend the trio but end up being seen as this weird Hufflepuff stalker girl instead. Susan Bones and Hannah Abbot seem like people I'd be friends with in real life anyways. I can be kind of competitive academically, so I can see me and Hermione having a rivalry (as I kill myself trying to out study her but try not to appear that I'm killing myself to do so). I'd blow off Astronomy though. It seems like stuff muggles have already all figured out.

I'd try my best to gather some information to get Sirius freed. I think I'd use a cover that I was a magical Nancy Drew junior detective. I'd learn some detective spells and something that will "surprise" reveal Pettigrew in the middle of class (humano revelo?). Private detective seems like it would be a cool career as an adult anyways.

I think I'd also sell homemade house memorabilia during Quidditch games. Money is most likely going to be an issue. I could probably get decent at transfiguring things into pennants, giant foam hands, buttons, etc. Maybe see if I can get permission to sell some hot chocolate if the profit margin seems worth it?

I think there's a good chance Dumbledore would erase my memory or something (or just think I'm nutters) if I came clean right away. I'd try my best to get rid of the Horucruxes myself before Voldemort is resurrected, at least the more easily accessible ones. The diary I could intercept during Lockhart's book signing. I'd make a show of looking for something and after Malfoy walks out ask Ginny if she'd seen my diary. Then the damn thing goes in the room of requirement and I don't touch it until I can destroy it. Honestly, figuring out how to destroy the horrucruxes would be the hard part (volcano?). Nagini, Voldemort, and probably the cup (although I'd try to find it) would be up to Dumbledore or Harry.

I'd try to learn Occlumency in the mean time, just in case the shit hit the fan and I had to confide in Dumbledore anyways. I don't think Dumbledore's evil, but I don't want to take the chance that I'm memory screwed and sorting gum wrappers with Mrs. Longbottom in Saint Mungos.

I'd try to track down Umbridge's brother and get some proof of her half blood status for just in case black mail/give to Fred and George and see what they can do with it.

Assuming if I could get around the trace (or it didn't work because my "soul" was older) and If I didn't have any kind of "family" to go to during the Summer I'd make myself an aging potion and then get a real estate agent to show me a foreclosed house somewhere out in the country. I'd then proceed to break a shit ton of laws and memory wipe the real estate agent and various muggle bank people that it even existed. I'd then make it unplotable. Then I wouldn't have to hide in the Room of Requirement every summer. Or I'd wimp out and not do any of this, but think about it a lot. lol

Oh and I would definitely befriend Luna in second year. I would not take her being bullied well. There'd be some shoe stealing thieves that would find they now have to poop through their noses.

Sorry for the big block of text. lol I've been flirting with writing a self insert.
