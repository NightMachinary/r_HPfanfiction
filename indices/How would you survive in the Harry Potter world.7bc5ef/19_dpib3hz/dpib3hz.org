Okay, I will write my answer from two perspectives, one from actual 11-year old me and one from the perspective of me now transported to my 11-year old body.

Actual 11-year old me, without prior knowledge of the plotline: I don't know. I was very nerdy and academically inclined as a young kid, almost like a Hermione but without the courage. I think I would probably not want to go to Hogwarts because "that's not the right thing to do! I need to get a /real/ education" or something... However, I'd probably get harassed from the Ministry to go to Hogwarts! Once I got there I wouldn't get involved in anything; it sounds too dangerous. When the war gets more dangerous I would probably just try to stay at home...

With prior knowledge: Hm, I don't know how I could convince people to /believe/ me if I tried to solve everything beforehand. So I would try to transfer to another wizarding school as soon as possible to be safe, knowing that the environment would likely become more dangerous in a few years. Maybe in America or something?
