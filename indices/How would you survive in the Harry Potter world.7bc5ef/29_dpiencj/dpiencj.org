Legal guardians make it hard to make your own choices.

Let's assume I'm in an orphanage. My legal guardian would probably be thrilled at a boarding school taking me free of charge for ten months out of the year. I might be able to influence them, but the prospect of improving everyone's lives by a substantial margin would tempt them. I'm not enough of a smooth talker to dissuade them.

Orphans have trouble getting adopted overseas. I'd have better luck in that regard if I were in Cambodia than the UK.

I would try to give people more knowledge and get out of the way. I'm a flee-er, not a fighter. I'd point Dumbledore to the Room of Requirement if possible to get rid of the diadem horcrux, and then I'd sort through its room of hidden things to earn pocket money (and do something about the vanishing cabinet).
