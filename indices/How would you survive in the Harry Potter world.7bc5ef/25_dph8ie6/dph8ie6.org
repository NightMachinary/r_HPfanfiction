I'd snag a time Turner, and fake bodies for everyone who died. Use my knowledge if how and when they died to switch places with them under polyjuice, drop the fake body and timeturner out when they "died" to save myself. Either that or a construct could die.

Let everything play out as before, only now there's a bunker with Sirius, Hedwig, Dumbledore, Remus, George, tonks, Moody and anyone else in it. They bunker down until the end and then they are released, alive.
