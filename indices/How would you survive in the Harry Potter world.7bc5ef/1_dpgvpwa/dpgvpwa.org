Since you wrote that I remember all of the books content, this is going to be one hell of a fixing-marathon for me.

- Go to Hogwarts (Hope for Gryffindor, but any house would work. Slytherin would just suck because could you /imagine/ sharing a dorm with Malfoy?)

- Become friends with Harry (which also would be vastly more difficult as a Slytherin)

- fix stuff left and right

Frankly, I'd mostly focus on making the Resurrection not happen at all. Which means getting Pettigrew imprisoned and consequently Sirius free.

I'm not sure if I'd reveal to Dumbledore that I know whats gonna happen. It would probably make many things easier. If he knows how to imprison a spirit, for example, we could trap Voldemort at the end of the first year from where I can reveal to Dumbledore the existence of the Horcrux /plus/ the existence of the Horcrux in Harry giving the old man enough time to research how to remove said Horcrux without killing Harry. He would have enough time without doom looming over everybody's head, since Voldemort would be imprisoned in spectral form within a saltmine turned atomic waste dump under a Fidelius Charm, or something. Plus, if I tell Dumbledore, he can get the ball on Sirius rolling through some pretense. Which is a gamble, to be fair, but I'll trust the intention of Rowling's writing and assume Dumbledore would be supportive here.

If I could get Voldemort removed from the immediate equation, I got a lot of space to breathe. Second year is easily fixed. You remind Ginny what a shit idea it is to write in something that talks back. If the advice isn't heeded, you turn her brothers on her. If that isn't enough, you write a letter to her father. Simultaneously, since I already talked to Albus (I'd totally be on first name basis already), I can tell him that the diary is a Horcrux and he could just trade Ginny the diary for a Kneazle she can talk to when shes lonely.

Third year will probably be the most normal one ever. Pettigrew is already in Azkaban, Sirius out of it. We have Lupin as a Defense teacher. I'd probably make it my mission to try and break the curse on the Defense position. Lupin for another year would be dope. Also, who's interested in seeing what happens when a timeturner produces paradoxes? Everybody? Good! 'Cause you bet your ass I will try that. Will there be 2 Hermiones? Lets hope not. Can you imagine that conversation? "Hi, mum and dad. I time-cloned myself and now you have twin daughters."

Fourth Year is already fixed. No Peter - no signs of the Dark Lord - ergo, no Crouch junior. Still... I'd probably check on Alastor Moody, should my mission fail and Lupin isn't Defense Professor in fourth year. Then again... I'd check any Defense Teacher. Unfortunately I am neither a Cursebreaker, nor old enough - and to be quite honest, probably also not as handsome as Bill Weasley, so asking Fleur to the ball in the hope of pairing myself up with the quarter-veela probably isn't happening. Maybe I'd ask Hermione before Krum does it? That would probably depend on who I like and whom I don't like at this point (and if there are 2 or more time clones of Hermione). /Anyway/ - I can assume that Harry isn't part of the tournament, so we're cool there. If somehow, for some reason someone /did/ infiltrate the tournament and Harry is part of it, well... Dragons, Mermen, Labyrinth and I'll research how to dispell portkeys. I'm just not entirely sure where that portkey would lead anyway, since Voldemort is still chilling in the deepest cavern of some radioactive saltmine nobody but Dumbledore remembers the location of.
