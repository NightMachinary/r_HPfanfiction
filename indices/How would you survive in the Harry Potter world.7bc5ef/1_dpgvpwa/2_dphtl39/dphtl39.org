Most of your plan is brilliant, but this one:

#+begin_quote
  Fourth Year is already fixed. No Peter - no signs of the Dark Lord - ergo, no Crouch junior. Still... I'd probably check on Alastor Moody
#+end_quote

I'd send an anonymous tip to Amelia Bones about Barty Jr, so that he got the Dementor's Kiss and his senior got to send to Azkaban as payback for locking up Sirius.

With respect to the Diary, just tell Dumbledore Ginny was writing in it. Let Dumbledore show who T.M. Riddle really was to Ginny.

Finally, I would ask Hermione out IMMEDIATELY, or Luna?
