  I'd send an anonymous tip to Amelia Bones about Barty Jr, so that he got the Dementor's Kiss and his senior got to send to Azkaban as payback for locking up Sirius.
#+end_quote

Yes, but only if I can't get one thing to happen. World Cup, right? Barty in an invisibility cloak right behind Harry and Ron. Would be a shame if someone tripped, wouldn't it? Maybe grab the cloak in a wild dash to get balance back, and maybe dump butterbeer all over it.

Because honestly, I don't know and do not want to find out if Aurors can track anonymous letters if they really want to. It will do in a pinch, but even if Operation World Cup fails I'd still rather just go to Dumbledore with that and let him handle that. If push comes to shove, he'd have more options to explain stuff away.

  With respect to the Diary, just tell Dumbledore Ginny was writing in it. Let Dumbledore show who T.M. Riddle really was to Ginny.
#+end_quote

Probably, yeah. Fast and quick. I'd still get her a Kneazle, though. There was a reason she wrote into that diary and someone to talk to would probably do her a lot of good if that someone doesn't possess her.

  Finally, I would ask Hermione out IMMEDIATELY, or Luna?
#+end_quote

I love the character of Hermione, I really do. But I won't make a definite statement on this because I can't say if I still do after sharing - what - a good 250 to 300 days with her in the same dorm for 3 years? For Luna the same. I probably love talking to her from time to time, but I am not sure if I'd be cut out for a closer friendship with Luna Lovegood.
