Ya know, people bring this up all the time, and IIRC the canon ruling was don't trust something if you can't see where it keeps it's brain or some such.

Which would sound like a good rule, regardless of the exact phrasing.... but Sorting Hat. Which has no brain, is a magic item, and is trusted to look through children's minds AND make life changing decisions for them.

It's kinda sets a rather bad precedent that sounds like a magic diary is great idea, and I'm surprised most of the rich kids don't have one.
