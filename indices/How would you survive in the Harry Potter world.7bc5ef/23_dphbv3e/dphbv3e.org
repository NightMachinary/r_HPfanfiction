Honestly, based on my personality, I'd be in Gryffindor or Slytherin (hopefully Gryffindor). Lay low for a while. Study magic really hard because, you know, IT'S MAGIC! Once I know my way around a spell or three (around 3rd or 4th year) start to subtly make friends with Harry and gang. Join the DA and demonstrate my (hopefully) strong magic skills, gain their trust. Doubt Ron and I get along, at least at first, due to my massive crush on Hermione (Emma), but may the best man win.

At this point I'm probably more qualified than the ministry six, except maybe Hermione's knowledge and Harry's experience, but certainly better than Ron, Neville, Luna & Ginny. So naturally it would be the ministry seven.

Sixth year I secretly take the dark mark, betray the gang to Voldemort, revealing I'm actually Riddle's son, my name was an anagram for I AM TOM RIDDLE JR'S SON obviously.

The rest is history.

Third paragraph is a joke, but who knows. Maybe Hermione chooses Ron and I'm consumed by jealously.
