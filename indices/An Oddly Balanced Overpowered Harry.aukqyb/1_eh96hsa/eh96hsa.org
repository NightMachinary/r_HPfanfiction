I don't understand the appeal of this story after reading 2 and 1/2 chapters. Harry killing the Dursleys? Fine, okay. Harry being delusionally psychotic and lines like

#+begin_quote
  He imagined the awe-inspiring sight of all the broken dead bodies in a sea of red ooze and giggled again
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  "I shouldn't kill them," he said to himself with a sigh. The idea of cutting them into pieces and rearranging their body parts imagined quite appealing. "the headmaster wouldn't like that."
#+end_quote

are just silly and lame.

Edit: Okay, I somehow read 12 chapters of this to see if it got any better. I now feel the same about Worthy of Magic as Roger Ebert felt about North.
