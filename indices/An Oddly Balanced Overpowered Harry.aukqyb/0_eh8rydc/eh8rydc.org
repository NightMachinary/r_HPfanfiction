I mean.. I feel like that's just how most decent/good powerful Harry fics are. They don't have /stupid/ OP Harry. He's really strong for his age, but he's not pummeling Dumbledore at 11 years old. I can't say I've heard of many even half decent fics where he's capable of that.

Many of these are a something of a threat, but that's because they're older.
