Overpowered means your power is over that which would be expected. A two year old who can bench 100 pounds is overpowered while a 25 year old body builder lifting 100 pounds isn't overpowered.

Harry is overpowered because... His has power that you wouldn't expect an eleven year old to have! /Drops mic/
