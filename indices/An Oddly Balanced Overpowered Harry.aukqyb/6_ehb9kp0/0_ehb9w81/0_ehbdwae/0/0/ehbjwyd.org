Simple. You cannot be overpowered if you can be overpowered. What I mean is if ther are multiple beings in a setting that can beat said overpowered character, than he cannot be overpowered. Powerful, sure. But if someone has more power than him than he's not overpowered. Superman is a good amount of the time overpowered in his stories, because other beings have to use trickery, or underhanded tactics, but Harry has many people in that story that can beat him. Not even only top tier, but most adult wizards can beat him at the point you seem to be referring to. So in every possible way you can think of he's not overpowered. Prove me wrong, go on I dare you to tell me how he's overpowered in that story.
