The definition is not the arbiter of definitions. It only speaks for common usage. There are words that exist that aren't in dictionaries and words with completely different meanings that the dictionary fails to catch. Does a word not found in the dictionary suddenly lose all meaning because it isn't there? If all dictionaries vanished tomorrow, would language collapse? The answer to both is no.

It saddens me to see someone attempting to be intellectual to fall for such a simple mistake.
