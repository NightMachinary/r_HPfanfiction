It's less an insult and more of a hint that you need to recognize what you're doing. Either way, I've realized I care more about sleeping than responding to you. I'll probably continue when I wake up though. You see, I have a principle that someone who rejects reality multiple times has shown a sufficient level of dishonesty for me to disregard them without being dishonest myself.
