But he's clearly not. To be overpowered is to not be balanced, what you said is a literal oxymoron. You cannot have a balanced overpowered character, because to be overpowered means he has no equal. That's why it's a powerful Harry story, and not an overpowered Harry story. Just look up the definition of overpowered.
