What you mean is a powerful Harry, not an OP Harry. Sure maybe he's OP compared to the students of Hogwarts, but that does not make him OP in the setting of the story, because there are plenty of people who can offer him a challenge. He is powerful, not OP. Please learn the difference, one can be challenged, the other cannot.

Thanks,\\
