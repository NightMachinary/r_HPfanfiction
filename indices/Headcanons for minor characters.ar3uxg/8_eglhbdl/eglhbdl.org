For the Next Generation

The Cursed Child does not exist.

#+begin_quote
  Teddy Lupin:
#+end_quote

The son of Remus and Nymphadora, Teddy was raised by Andromeda, with Harry having an active role as godfather. He joins the Aurors, but he is more interested in what it means to fight for a cause than the actual battles.

  Rose Weasley:
#+end_quote

Sorted into Hufflepuff

I like to think that Rose has a special bond with Neville and Herbology is her favorite subject. She is somewhat distant from her mother, who is very involved in the Ministry, while Rose despises government and bureaucracy in general. Rose has a habit of falling asleep in the library--though her favorite place to read is outside the Herbology greenhouses. She goes barefoot at every opportunity and carries schoolbooks and storybooks around constantly. Her favorite stories are the Dr. Doolittle books by Hugo Lofting. She grows up to own a greenhouse and sells plants to potion makers.

  Hugo Weasley:
#+end_quote

Gryffindor

Hugo is fascinated by story and myth and the name Hugo. He carries around a copy of /Les Miserables./ Due to the size of the book, nobody notices that it isn't a textbook. He is meticulous and organized--his speciality being able to push Rose's buttons, for his own amusement. He knows exactly how to make her scream, how to make her laugh, and how to make her cry. Hugo was able to out-wrestle and out-rough-house her by the time he was six. Their dynamic is not completely antagonistic though--as much as he likes making Rose scream, Hugo is also the one who reads to her when she's sick in the Hospital Wing.

  Fred II Weasley
#+end_quote

Gryffindor

Despite being fascinated by pranks, he spends too much time on the technical breakdowns for the "perfect prank" that he never actually has time to pull them. As a result, all the professors think he's the most well-behaved Weasley of the lot.

#+begin_quote
  Roxanne Weasley
#+end_quote

Ravenclaw

The smallest of the Weasleys, Roxanne makes observations. She sits still and watches and makes records--she got the idea from Hugo, who records everything that makes Rose scream--but decided to do it for everybody. She grows up to be a historian.

#+begin_quote
  Molly II Weasley
#+end_quote

Ravenclaw

Molly, Percy's oldest daughter, is every bit a mother hen as her grandmother. She also favors some Muggle tools, taking after her mother. She wears glasses like her father.

  Lucky Weasley:
#+end_quote

I'm going to assume you meant Lucy. Percy's second daughter, I must confess I hadn't given any thought to until I read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8035006/1/The-Noticing-of-Lucy-Weasley][/The Noticing of Lucy Weasley/]]. So yeah, a girl who idolizes her daddy and acknowledges the importance of pencil pushers.

  Scorpius Malfoy:
#+end_quote

Scorpius Malfoy was sorted into Hufflepuff. He yearns to become a Healer. A quiet sort, he is utterly baffled by the antics of the Everyone Else. Being an only child and having no cousins close to his age, the way Albus and Rose and Lily can argue to the point of screaming one day and the next save one another favorite deserts is among the strangest thing he's ever seen.

  James Sirius Potter:
#+end_quote

Gryffindor

Given my inclination for Lucy, I find that James is not entirely unlike his grandfather, only with a far bigger ego. Delighted to be the son of heroes, James has a highly inflated sense of self. While popular among his classmates, he alienated himself from many of his cousins. To give him much needed discipline, Harry sends him to spend a summer with his Muggle cousins. Without his wand. The months away are deeply transformative, after James sees one of his cousins take on a gang of bullies despite being outnumbered four to one.
