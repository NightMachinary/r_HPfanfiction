Jimmy Peakes and Colin Creevey were together. Jimmy never really recovers from Colin's death, but he stays close to Dennis, who marries Gabrielle Delacour.

Later on in life, Harry and Ginny realize they fell in love with /images/ of each other. They only got married so quickly because the society was pressuring them. However, they choose to stay together for the sake of the children. Around that same time, Al "Don't call me Albus" changes his middle name to Rubeus, which also helps to heal the family. Harry finally realizes the difference between infatuation and love.

Hermione and Ron were also pressured to get married and have children after Harry and Ginny had James. It takes them a /long/ time to settle their differences, but by the time Rose and Hugo reach school, they're... /reasonably/ happy together. Hermione resents Molly, though, who was the person who did the most pressuring. Every so often, Ron and Hermione take a vacation, away from his family, to reaffirm their love for each other. She works as a legislator for a long time before becoming the Headmistress after the kids graduate from Hogwarts.
