Lavender and Pavarti were in a relationship which surprised everyone and yet no one. They had a hard time after the war because lavender, being obsessed with looks, was extremely insecure about being scratched and turned by fenrir greyback but after a long talk with bill weasley who could relate (not completely because he wasnt turned like she was but also had scars marring his face) grew up to realize that looks weren't everything and adopted triplet girls with parvati.

Percy Weasley bent the rules once in hogwarts and that was only for his late night snogging (almost shagging) sessions with Oliver wood. They later married and opened an orphanage for the children of the war. (Molly knits every single one of the children sweaters every year)

Hermione becomes an unspeakable which creates an even bigger rift between her and Ron. They ultamitly divorce on good terms after talking about it like civilized adults. None of their children hold it against them and Ron still meets her for brunch every Saturday.

Ron eventually marries padma and they officially open a small shop together that sells thing secondhand or at a lower price but still in pristine condition. Ron never wants anyone to feel like he did with too short robes and battered books.

When teddy is unconscious after falling down the stairs at Hogwarts his metamorphing stops and reveals his true looks with his father's sandy hair and his mother's original silver-grey eyes. Mcgonagall takes a picture and he crys when he sees it. (He kind of looks like a wolfstar baby but that's just the black genes ðŸ˜‰)

Neville becomes the head of hufflepuff house once sprout also retires from that position. In his opinion it was the proudest day of his life when he introduced the first year hufflepuffs for the first time.

Luna finally proves the existence of hundreds of 'made up' creatures. She often wonders if the ravenclaw bullies are still laughing.

Charlie Weasley is Pan and never settled down with anyone but he does meet up with hagrid and Newt scamander once a month to chat about creatures and they finally free up to 14 dragons from the underground of gringotts bank.

Susan bones becomes the minister for magic after following in her aunts footsteps and changes everything. After 30 years of re-elections she settles down happily having rid the government from as much corruption as possible. She marries Terry boot at 21 and they have 2 childeren.

After much hard work from the golden trio Regulus and Sirius Black both get the recognition they deserve and Regulus ever gets his own memorial in hogsmeade and an Order of Merlin 1st class.

The atrocious Narssisistic statue in the atrium of the ministry gets taken down and is replaced with a war memorial that is highly detailed and made of purple crystal. The names of every muggle, wizard, witch and creature casualty from both wars and the war with grindelwald are marked on it.

Fireworks are made illegal without the proper paperwork and precautions after too many accidents. PTSD is a real thing that effects almost everyone in the magical world. The colors and sounds look to much like spells.

George makes talismans and jewelry that blocks out triggers and candy that helps with trauma and nightmares. It saddens everyone that they sell out in the first day.

Neville pours his family fortune into the long term ward at st mungos and the medical research labs. After 12 years he is able to cure his parents.
