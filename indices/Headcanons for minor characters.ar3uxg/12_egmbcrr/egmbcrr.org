James Sirius Potter (2004) is in Slytherin. He's partially neglected by his parents, and as a result he's extremely close to Teddy and Andromeda. He tries to do everything that's expected of him but his parents never acknowledge it. His Hogwarts class is the biggest one in recent history because everyone started having children after hearing Ginny Potter was pregnant.

Albus Severus Potter (2005) is in Gryffindor. After learning the truth about Snape, and some about Dumbledore, too, he grows to resent Harry. He absolutely hates his name and wouldn't saddle it on anyone. He also wants nothing to do with Scorpius Malfoy, who's a stuck-up snob in Al's opinion (but actually he's jealous that Scorpius is close to Rose).

Lily Luna Potter (2007) is a romantic as a child, but then she realizes her parents' marriage is a sham. She has a lot of insecurities when she starts dating because she's not sure she can distinguish between infatuation and love. She's in Ravenclaw.

Susan Bones works in the bookshop. She's married to Ernie Macmillan.

Harry discovers that he has some distant cousins through Marius Black. One of these cousins married Penelope Clearwater and they have children around James' age/a little older.

Ron and Hermione have an amicable divorce once Hugo starts at Hogwarts.

Neville and Hannah have children closer in age to Lorcan and Lysander. They're all a few years younger than Lily.

Zacharias Smith has an "oops" baby with Romilda Vane. He walks out on them, but the baby forces Romilda to grow up in ways she never expected. She ends up marrying Dean Thomas later on.

All three of Bill and Fleur's children have blond hair, but Louis doesn't get actual Veela traits. He's best friends with Fred 2, who's the same age as him. They're a year younger than Al and Rose.
