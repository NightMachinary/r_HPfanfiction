I'm fairly certain that it is a [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/649126/James-Spookie][James Spookie]] fic. If that notion of mine is correct, it would either be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10649604/1/The-Legacy-Preservation-Act][The Legacy Preservation Act]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8678295/1/Things-We-Do-For-Love][Things We Do For Love]]. I'm checking, but I think it is one of those two.

EDIT: Not The Legacy Preservation Act. That one was a Harry getting a coat/jacket from Daphne. Check back again later.

EDIT EPISODE II ATTACK OF THE CLONES: I'm a goddamn witchdoctor. It is 100% linkffn(Things We Do For Love by James Spookie). She makes the joking comment in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8678295/12/Things-We-Do-For-Love][chapter 12]].
