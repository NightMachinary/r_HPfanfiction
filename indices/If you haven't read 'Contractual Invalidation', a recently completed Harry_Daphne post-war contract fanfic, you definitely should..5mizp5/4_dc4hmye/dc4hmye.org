I'm looking forward to reading this, but I'm apparently I'm incapable of reading fanfiction right now. I think the coffee is making me cantankerous. Once I got passed feeling like

#+begin_quote
  The Auror office was a peculiar place. It was the main sub-section of blah blah blah
#+end_quote

and now I'm stuck at

#+begin_quote
  He never planned to stay a simple Auror forever, of course
#+end_quote

Harry doesn't really do plans. At least, he didn't when he was younger. Of course, he can and probably did change and mature and all that. But I doubt canon Harry thought past becoming an Auror. So claiming he always viewed becoming an Auror as a stepping stone is sitting wrong with me.

I need to bake some cookies or something. I don't know what my issue is. Just pissy I guess
