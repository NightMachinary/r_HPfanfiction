I read a couple of chapters several months ago. What I didn't like was that Daphne had no choice but to date him. Well, there was a choice - marry him or date him. Compared to Harry who could break the contract at any point. I know that it is addressed couple of times in the starting chapter. Harry does have his doubts. But really? Forcing someone to date you? Who does that?

And there was this (alluded) part that James mentioned in the contract - that the contract was only valid if Daphne was certain 'sizes'. It's like "my son won't marry your daughter. Unless she's super hot. In that case, yeah, he can own her." (and yes, 'ownership' was the word used in the contract) Really? Let alone the whole treating someone like an object, but there's no way Lily would have gone for that.

I guess the second point boils down to the contract part of the plot - which didn't make it good at all for me.

That aside, the writing is pretty good. It is very engrossing - reason for which I read several chapters before giving up. The characterisation is interesting. It's not cannon. But none of them is like super-perfect. Each of them has their own flaws and qualities.
