I feel like they addressed the fact that Harry was a huge asshole for doing that pretty well. Seems to be a part of the plot. They talk about it a bit in the beginning and a little more later on, and at the end of the day I never found it too terribly outside Harry's apparent character and motivations.

James and Lily buying off on the contract was a bit outside of my suspension of disbelief as well. Plus there was a scene where Daphne reflects on how hard it was to meet the physical requirements of the contract and that was a little too disturbing for what was meant to be a throw away joke IMO.

Overall I think the good points outweigh the bad especially in the trope ridden wasteland that is H-D fics.
