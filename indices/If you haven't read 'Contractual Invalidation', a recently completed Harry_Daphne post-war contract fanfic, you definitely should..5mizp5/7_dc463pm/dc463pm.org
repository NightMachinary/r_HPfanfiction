It was a fun read, I just never really understood /why/ the contract was made in the first place. We don't have a ton of honest-to-goodness canon personality for James and Lily, so I would have liked a little more time spent on explaining why they would have done such a thing. James "looking out for Harry" was a cute gag, but seriously, why'd he do it? Why'd Lily go along with it?

I can buy a legal marriage contract because those things have existed and in a smaller scale still exist today, and this is hardly the most obnoxious use of the trope I've seen. But I would assume that most people would be a bit more curious if they found themselves in one.

Edit: It's 6am and I haven't had my first cup of tea. Talking gud is hard.
