linkffn(Contractual Invalidation) for those who want a ffnbot link, or downloads or whatever.

A fun fic, plays with contracts, Ice Queen-ish (phrase never actually used, but gives the feeling all other fics fail to), a sneaky Harry, fun worldbuilding and a celebration of things fathers do for us.

4/5, 9/10, 6/7. Worth a read.
