I'm actually not sure if you're joking, but there would not be more than one. Think about when Hermione and Harry travel back in time. They go back three hours, and when they get back to present time, they replace the old Harry and Hermione. On a typical day, let's say Hermione uses the time turner for a class. She'll go to one class (say Arithmancy) then turn back time and go to the other (say Divination) During that hour, there is one Hermione in Arithmancy and one in Divination. But when the hour is over the Hermione that was in Arithmancy has used the time turner so she IS the same Hermione that's in Divination. That's why Ron and Harry notice her disappearing sometimes. Once the window of time travel is over there is ONE Hermione. Not two.
