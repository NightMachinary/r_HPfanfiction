Bill and Ted disagree. So does Austin Powers.

I think I remember Dumbledore telling Hermione to make sure she and Harry didn't see themselves while saving Sirius, but I don't know if that's just a Ministry regulation, a "you could unravel the space/time continuum" warning, or what. And since Harry did see himself and it was ultimately beneficial, I don't know if that rule applies.
