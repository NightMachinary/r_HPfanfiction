Can't be bothered to start linking things but look at warhammer 40k, dark souls and a few of the star wars fics in crossover sections on fanfiction.net. I think it was Darth imperius' stories that i read a while ago which were very decent star wars crossovers if that is your sort of thing and I don't think that they contain any slash.
