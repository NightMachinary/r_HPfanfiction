Ok so I'm not answering the promt but there exists a Dramione fic that when Hermione gets drunk, she tends to apparate on the spot and go do some PETA level shit like freeing kittens. A small hum is all the warning Ron and Harry usually get before she apparates. In the story, Draco has to learn to deal with this and hijinks ensue.

If anyone knows what I'm talking about, link it! I'm awful at favoriting fics
