“So um, Roger I would like to apologise once more for Hermione's behaviour...” Harry began, stopping to nervously clear his throat before looking briefly back up at the nearly naked man and his current(equally nude) partner.

“Hermione had a tough day and...well she had a few drinks and got into a bit of a tiff with Ron and, well, she mentioned you tried to ask her out before you left and seemed to suddenly think you were a...better fit now.” The scarred boy awkwardly finished as he nodded to the face down, stupefied Hermione slumped over the shattered remains of Roger's possibly antique coffee table.

“I would secondly like to apologise for failing to restrain Ron, or trying to calm him before he followed her into the floo-I'm sorry their fight escalated into your home.” Harry plowed on, unable to look at said home owner in the face and instead glancing at where Ron was laying sprawled out over a broken (also possibly antique) grandfather clock.

“However, I would like to know-since it started the duel in the first place /why/ when two people, known across Britain as a couple, stumbled into your living room arguing, neither clearly in their right state of mind while you were...engaged with another women-did you suggest a foursome?”
