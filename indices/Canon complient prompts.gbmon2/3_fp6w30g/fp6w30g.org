Sure, I'll give it a go.

- After helping the Gryffindor Quidditch team achieve victory, Harry attends his first ever party.
- Disappointed by the wizarding world's taste in music, Hermione and Dean join together to introduce the rest of the Gryffindors to decent music.
- In order to improve their proficiency in Divination, Parvati and Lavender began reading fortunes for the Gryffindors. It was only a matter of time before the sickles came in, and chaos not too long after.
- When Seamus and Neville have to work together in Potions, Snape almost has a heart attack when he realizes what's in the lesson plans for the day.
- Ernie dreaded going to his first meeting as prefect. Ever since he found out that he had been made prefect, he knew that he would have to work harder than he'd ever work to help those around him, especially after Cedric's death. The moment he stepped in the prefect's carriage, however, he knew things were only going to get worse.
