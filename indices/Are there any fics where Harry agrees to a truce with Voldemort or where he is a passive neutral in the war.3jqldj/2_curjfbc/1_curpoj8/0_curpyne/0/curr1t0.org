He was tricked by a seventeen year old, who seemingly had far better long term vision than Lord Voldemort. Hence incompetent. It also undermines the brilliance of Voldemort's coup in canon via which he kept the entire country in doubt and fear, and common people would never have got the opportunity to run behind Harry as they did here.

But that is hardly the only thing wrong with the story.

  here had been rumors that Potter was descended from Gryffindor, but who would have thought that the mudblood was descended from a squib branch of Ravenclaw? And that the Longbottom brat was descended from Hufflepuff? They somehow managed to have the school's magic recognize Potter as a Slytherin descendent, giving them ties to all four of the founders and the right to claim the school their ancestors had founded. Under this magic and logic, they had removed 'their' library and family effects from the building.

Lol. Really? The descendant of the founders, all coincidentally belonging to Harry's year. And Harry is the heir of Gryffindor and Slytherin too. How convenient.

Then the other stuff: Impenetrable family blood wards (if they exist, why did Dumbledore put Harry with the Dursleys?), constant mention of phrases like the 'light side' and 'light profession', Hogwarts conveniently becoming dead because the author said so, the idea that none of the DEs have any idea how to run a country despite Voldemort's intelligence and many DEs being prominent politicians from canon and general contrivances that Harry and co. somehow foresaw but Voldemort was blind to.

Oh, and this:

  Without muggles or Light fools for Voldemort to torture, the only fools available were us.

  With every setback, our Lord became more and more out of control and everyone knew it.\\
  You see, we'd never mentioned his tendency to break out in random crucios as the urge hit. Guess that secret is out. One day he moved through Hogsmeade and the Alley crucioing everyone he saw wearing glasses.

Yes. Because Voldemort needs a constant supply of people to torture or he wouldn't survive. Seriously? If canon shows us anything, it is that Voldemort has endless patience. Showing him as an incompetent, torture-happy fool wins no points from me.

And all this is in about a thousand words. The premise is stupid and Voldemort's characterization is terrible. Hence Fail.
