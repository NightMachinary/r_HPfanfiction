Yes, there are, but sadly, they are usually wizard/Wizarding Britain bashing fics, where Harry escapes Britain and basically writes a self-righteous "fuck you" monologue to be published in the Prophet. Not that I don't kind of agree with that, but it's usually too boring and one sided. I think it would take a really good writer to write such a fic in an actually interesting manner.
