#+begin_quote
  Immortality is not all it's cracked up to be. At least not when the only other immortal around is your worst enemy and possibly the closest thing to a friend you have left. The war ended over a hundred years ago and Harry Potter and Tom Riddle have each been enjoying the quiet life, and politely ignoring each other. However, war is coming and enemies abound. AU. Complete.
