You need to read Sesc's linkffn(By that Last Candle's Light). Very well written, like all of Sesc's stories and I like it despite Harry's OOCness. It was going to be Harry/Bellatrix story, but alas, it was abandoned before it went anywhere.

Oh, and this is one of my favorite scenes in fanfiction:

  "So prove it, then!" I snapped. "Prove to me that you are strong enough to master something as easy as your own fate. Here, now, and we will swear that neither will die at the hand of the other, and both can live. This is your final chance to break the cycle and correct the mistake that began in that pub on a rainy night. 'Either must die at the hands ...' No! We shake our hands. We walk away. We live, both of us. We are the most powerful wizards of our generations. If not us, then who?"

  The whipping wind was so cold, and it cloaked me like the warmest blanket. It whistled around us, tearing at Voldemort's cloak. My voice rose.

  "And the prophecy as a rule? For us? We long since gave up on complying with anything. Rules are only there to be broken. We swear not to kill each other, and force the world to change its course, force our will onto the outcome that is set. We prove once and for all that nothing is greater than magic. This will truly mark our power."

  Green into red, we stared at each other, his face oddly twisted, a strange, hungry look upon it; suddenly reminiscent of another expression I had seen, three years ago, on a boy named Tom Riddle, then as old as I was now. The hints of that boy were still there, breaking through the surface now, for a single, timeless moment.

The atmosphere Sesc creates is perfect for this, and it manages to make you buy the moment despite how unbelievable it might seem without context.
