Wow! I cannot tell you how much that means to hear! I'm eliminating the A/N (which was more of a note to beta readers), and re-editing the first chapter, cutting canon down to a minimum. I'm also reworking the 2nd chapter to make the rabbit a bit clearer, and to add more suspense with H and Hr being tracked in the dark by the snatchers.

You're right about the collapsing building. Re-reading it, I think it is a bit much. I'll focus more on the chase through the streets, and work on making it less cheesy.

I'm glad you like the story, and I thinkthat means you'll like where it's going. Thanks you for your help! I'll gold you in a bit, when I'm out from the office.
