Very enjoyable read after that first chapter. At first I was incredulous after a few pages of by the book intro, but as soon as the AK hit the bell jar, it grabbed me and pulled me in. The next few chapters definitely give a feeling of anxiety, confusion, and anticipation, as Harry's whisked from one dream/reality/vision to the next. Hermione's weakness and vulnerability is a big change from what I usually read, but of course, you are drawing a world where at least teenage Harry and Hermione are truly human, with real reactions and confusion. Did find a few typos, but those can get weeded out with a beta reader or three. I have found myself having to go back and reread portions of different parts, because you definitely can pack a lot of detail into each line. Can't wait to read more.
