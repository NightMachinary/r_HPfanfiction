Thank you so much! First chapter edit is on the way, and I'm working on "unpacking" the chapter to make it smoother, focusing more on suspense and less on action-packing and details.

There's just so many details that I want to include, but I know I have to weed it out.

Thank you for your complements! I'll let you know as more of the fic is completed.
