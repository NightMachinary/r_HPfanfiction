Nah, it's quite common for stories to say that there will be X awesome changes and then you start reading it and see that the story is just a canon rehash with rather inconsequential change and ended up abandoned somewhere in the second or third year. Harry getting adopted by Lupin with a teased Fleur relationship seem oddly susceptible to that.
