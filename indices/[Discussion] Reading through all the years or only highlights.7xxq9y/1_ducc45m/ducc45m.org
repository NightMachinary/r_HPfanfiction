Personally I hate canon rehashes, i've read the books. Canon rehashes with minor au elements are just as bad.

I like what many original fictions do, where they just start the story and the more boring past elements are referred to in the dialog or character thoughts. Not flashbacks, like some fanfics do, but just a few sentences that allow you to get the general gist.
