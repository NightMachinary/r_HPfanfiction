It's worth noting, though, that the vast majority of Naruto-style SI's are really isekai stories; the tradition of labeling them SI stories is a quirk of the fandom due to the enormous influence of Dreaming of Sunshine and the countless works it inspired. For instance, the author of Deja Vu no Jutsu has other "SI" stories on her account with main characters that have entirely different histories and personalities.

Granted, the same is probably true of a good chunk of the stories listed on this page, which were almost all written after DoS and probably inspired by its fandom.
