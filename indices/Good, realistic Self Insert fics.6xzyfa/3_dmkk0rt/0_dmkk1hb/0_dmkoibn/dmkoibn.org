Tried to read this one once. It starts out okay but the main character really starts to come off as inappropriate towards Hermione. It was weird because he actually had some chemistry in the beginning with Hermione then the author took it too far and it came off skeezy. Then there's some random Ron bashing in the middle to get Hermione/Harry together.

Also, special wandless magic user warning.
