I won't try and speak for other readers, I'll just explain why I enjoyed it so much.

First, my ideal fanfic includes a dark/gray and powerful Harry who is shipped with another dark/gray character. Second, I can't stand fics where Harry and his ship instantly bond and have feelings for one another, I usually can't make it passed the first few chapters of those stories. Third I enjoy any story that can introduce OC's or a new world. BWL does all three of these well imo.

Lastly, and this is specific to BWL, I feel that Santi did an amazing job of keeping the reader on their toes trying to guess the character's true motives. With most fanfiction authors I can usually guess what the characters are going to do and what is going to happen in the story. While reading BWL I enjoyed the second guessing that I would do every time something new was revealed about Calypso.

While I admit this was one of the first fanfics that I read and have since read dozens, I find it very hard to recapture the feeling I had while reading the BWL. I distinctly remember not wanting to put my iPad down at night because Santi left me wanting to know what was going to happen in the next chapter.
