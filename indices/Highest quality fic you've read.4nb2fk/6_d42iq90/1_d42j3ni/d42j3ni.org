I forgot about Stages of Hope. It was extremely well written and the author did an amazing job of making the reader become emotionally attached to his versions of Harry and Hermione.

I absolutely loved The Sum of Their Parts up until the last chapter, the ending felt so rushed to me, I feel like it needed somewhere between 3-6 chapters to properly close out the story. My guess was always that something came up in the authors real life and they didn't want to abandon the story, which is some consolation.

As for the other two, I never read incomplete or abandoned stories, I have the Changeling marked as one to read once it's finished and the third part of BWP is abandoned so I won't be reading the first two.
