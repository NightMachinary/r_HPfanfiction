I don't really think bwp is particularly well writtn. It's GREAT to see ron/ginny in a timetravel fic, but i gave up halfway through. I don't want or need "harry kills voldemort in a week " fics - which is how the author defends it - but he made everyone involved into real idiots. Their halfbaked plans keep backfiring and harry, for reasons I can t get into, forgets his invisibility cloak at one point. Just leaves it on the ground. I can deal with the weird treatment of the weasleys since their timetravel affected things. It's the agonising stupidity of the characters that gets me. I dunno, I couldn't take it anymore after a while. It's a shame, therr's some cool hints at future conflict with umbridge and stuff, but ymmv, definitely.
