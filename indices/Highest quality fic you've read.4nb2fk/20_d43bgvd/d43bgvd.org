I'll nominate linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20).

It dives into humor enough to be called a humor fic, but it's also pretty serious. It is one of the few fics I've read that gives agency to a wide range of characters -- Draco, Lucius, Bellatrix, Snape, the main OC, Voldemort, the Muggle OCs, they all have their own plans that they try to advance, piling up on each other.

The writing quality is good enough not to distract me, which is what I mainly seek.

The main character doesn't crowd out their supporting allies too much. Harry's pushed to the background, which I personally appreciate, while Hermione is the straight person and the voice of common sense.

The production quality is pretty good -- low on misspellings, malapropisms, missing punctuation, etc.
