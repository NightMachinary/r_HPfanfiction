*How to use the Bot:*

Use the following:

- Fanfiction.net - linkffn(...)
- Archive of Our Own - linkao3(...)
- HP Fanfic Archive - linkffa(...)
- Fictionpress - linkfp(...)
- Adult FanFiction - linkaff(story URL only)

For example... with linkffn(...) In the (...) you can do the following:

--Linking by the title usually works - example: linkffn(An Unhealthy Fixation With Aurors) -- Linking using title and author will work more often due to more details - Example: linkffn(Emperor by Marquis Black) -- You can also use the fic code (in the URL) - Example: linkffn(5904185). This way should always work.
