I was really into fanfiction years and years ago (like before DH) and am only recently getting back into it so I'm not too familiar with most things written in the last few years but one of my all time favorites is "an unhealthy fixation with aurors" by oynnej. It's more mature than the original series but I absolutely adore how the characters are written and the plot is like something out of a NY Times best seller
