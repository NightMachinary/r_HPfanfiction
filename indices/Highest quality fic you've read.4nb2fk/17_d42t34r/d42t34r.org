In terms of writing quality, I'd recommend Unatoned -- linkffn(8262940).

Other fics I'd recommend with fairly high quality writing (that are quite well-known, I think, and have good ideas) are:

Wit of the Raven, linkffn(2740505);

Circular Reasoning, linkffn(2680093);

Hit The Ground Running, linkffn(9408516);

The Art of Self-Fashioning, linkffn(11585823);

and Ectomancer, linkffn(4563439).
