My favourite now is Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man, linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin]]) and not because of grammar (English is not my first language so not sure how well it is written) but because the plot is very interesting and it also includes grey Harry. The plot may seem clich√© but I promise, it's so much better! It's totally worth reading. I consider it a high quality fic because there is no bashing, it is logical, it doesn't follow canon at every turn, and, although the main plot idea with the wrong BWL is overused, all the other things are really original and well-written.
