Several of the ones I was going to suggest are already listed, but there are several that many might ignore, but I really think are more deserving of attention:

First: I'm Still Here by kathryn518. Its confirmed still being worked on, although has not been updated in some time, but its a VERY in depth story with lots of interesting aspects. It may not be everyones cup of tea but its worth reading. linkffn(9704180)

Second: The non traditional "Emperor" by Marquis Black. This is super AU HPFF. So AU it could honestly be its own story separate from any HP connection. But its worth a look. linkffn(5904185)

Also cant forget about Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. Not the best writing per say, but the quality level of the story itself and background is very high. [[http://hpmor.com/]]
