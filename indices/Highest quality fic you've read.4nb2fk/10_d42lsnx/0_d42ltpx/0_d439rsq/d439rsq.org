What makes you say that Emperor is well-written? You could take a butcher's knife to it and make it better. And it's inconsistent. There's a fair number of infodumps throughout and a ridiculous number of characters, which kills the pacing sometimes. Granted, I wouldn't say it's outright badly written, but imo it's certainly not in the running for highest quality.
