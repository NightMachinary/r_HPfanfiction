Seconding this. Emperor is so bad. It's indescribable, really. The author somehow found a way to make magical war boring. I checked out about 3/8ths of the way through when I realized I was just skimming the cliche boring bits to get to the action, then skimming the action to get back to the plot.

Also I'm really not a fan of the Edgy Assassin Femme Fatale trope, which iirc features pretty heavily after a while.
