I tried getting into I'm Still Here, but after the chapter long description of Iris (Think that was her name, the Fem!Harry) and Hermione's friendship at Hogwarts, where it was basically just a rehash of canon Harry's adventures and which we were already told about a chapter before, I couldn't get into it. Especially not when the author randomly threw in Ron bashing and decided to call that long chapter a 'brief' description of events.

Emperor is amazing, though.
