Er, I don't think The Boy Who Lived should even be in the conversation for "best written". However, saying that has nothing to do with how good or bad it is (which I am refraining from). There's plenty of grammar mistakes in it, a few typos which somehow made it past 5 betas, and some general sloppiness at times, all stuff that relates to raw quality.
