Culture Shock was incredible. It led me to the Culture series.

When you read the Culture, you'll understand why Harry compares the Sorting Hat to rape. In a world where sanctity of the mind is held in the highest regard, where your memories and thoughts are the only thing you truly own, someone rifling through your mind without your consent would indeed be as bad as rape.

I've not found a sci-fi fic anywhere near Culture Shock's calibre. And the Culture has to be my favorite sci-fi series.
