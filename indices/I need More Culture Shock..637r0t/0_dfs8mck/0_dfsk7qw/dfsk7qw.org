Damn you meddling kids for stealing my prized arguments. anyways aside from reiterating the above comment I shall also add that you basically made a request for something before ruining your request. you took the two most important aspects of culture and a culture/hp cross and ruined them. You took culture which is a highly advanced society and asked a member of said society not to rationalize "magic" at all, like not even try, and then as tusing said think that taking the sorting hat/legillimancy and decided to not equate that to rape or some other heinous crime where you have a highly advanced rational society wherein the most important thing about oneself is not their body nor possessions but their mind. Besides where magic is *mind* over not only matter but reality itself the invasion and violation of said mind should be looked upon by any rational as a heinous act of the highest degree akin to rape and murder being the violation of the body and soul.

Mind, Body, and Soul, are the most important things to both and reasonable person with a shred of self worth.

Then again, maybe you are of different opinion not being able to have your mind violated and having the violation of the soul as something that, not having anyone to tell of the experience, seem inconsequential.

edit: removed shitpost from shitpost and got a legitpost? what the hell did I just do.
