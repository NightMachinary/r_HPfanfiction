[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6562075/1/Isis-s-Bane-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire][Isis's Bane And The Goblet Of Fire]] is a HP/Stargate crossover which has a not-dissimilar setup and has actually been completed: a 14yo Harry is summoned to Hogwarts for the Triwizard Tournament after growing up fighting go'a'uld, practicing wandless magic, and acquiring technology. It's readable. Maybe read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4564625/1/Isis-s-Bane][Isis's Bane]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4564882/1/Isis-s-Bane-Tar-Chell-s-Wrath][Tar'Chell's Wrath]] first (previous stories which explain how he got there). linkffn(6562075;4564625;4564882)
