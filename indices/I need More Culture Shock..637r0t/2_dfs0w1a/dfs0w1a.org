What about linkffn(I Still Don't Know What I'm Looking For by kathryn518)?

Its a Star Wars crossover, with the typical Magic = The Force spiel, but a Harry who makes quite clear that if anything, The Force is only a very small part of Magic. It has some great character, for the price of being /reeeeeally/ slow.

A great fic, but unfortunately (at least for me) written in first person, is linkffn(The Havoc Side of the Force)

You could give linkffn(The Difference One Can Make) a chance. Its a GoT - or rather an ASOIAF crossover which doesn't shy away from explaining the stuff found in Westeros to you.

I don't know any crossovers with Culture, but maybe these strike your fancy?
