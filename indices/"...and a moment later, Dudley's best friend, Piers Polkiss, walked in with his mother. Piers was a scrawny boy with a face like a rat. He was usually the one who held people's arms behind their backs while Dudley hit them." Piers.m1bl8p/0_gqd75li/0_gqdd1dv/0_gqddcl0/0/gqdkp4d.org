Well crap. I'm kinda sad about having been beaten to the punch. I almost want to down vote myself now. Thanks for sharing though. That rap/poem is really annoying

The way I came to the idea was really random. I was looking for the part in Sorcerer's Stone about Harry's accidental apparation to the school roof when I saw the introduction to Piers as scrawny and rat-faced sidekick.

P.S. The same page mentions Mrs. Figg breaking her leg. I wonder how she did that...
