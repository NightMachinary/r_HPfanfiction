I can think of two that have been around for a while, but it's been forever since I read them. The first is /Altered Destinies/ linkffn(3155057). Older Harry, younger Tom, time travel.

The other has older Tom who never became Voldemort and I think 18 year old Harry. This one wasn't that much to my tastes (some of the pairings and plot points annoyed me), but it's certainly not a bad story. /A Riddled Universe/ linkffn(8678567).
