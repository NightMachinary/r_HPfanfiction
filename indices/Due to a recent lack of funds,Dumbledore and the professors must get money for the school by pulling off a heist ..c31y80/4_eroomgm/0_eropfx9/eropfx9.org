I'm going to expand on this idea in terms of DnD.

Dumbledore rolling up as a human warlock with disguise self and high Charisma. Flitwick as a halfling (goblins aren't generally good around people in DnD) rogue. Sprouts a half-elf nature cleric. McG is a druid who can only wild shape into cats. Snape is a drow ranger who specializes in herbalism and poisons. Hagrid would be a firbolg (half giant isn't really a thing afaik) barbarian multiclassed as a beast master ranger.
