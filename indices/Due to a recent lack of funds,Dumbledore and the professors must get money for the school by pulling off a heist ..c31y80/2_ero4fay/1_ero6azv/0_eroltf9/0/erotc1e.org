Holy shit, Harry Potter would actually fit great into a Series of Unfortunate Events styled narrative. I'm really tempted to try to write that now.

The second book even features an Incredibly Deadly Snake in both cases, and that minor detail makes me love this concept even more.

"But Professor, the Incredibly Deadly Basilisk isn't actually deadly at all! This is all a ploy by Lord Voldemort to scare everyone and somehow steal my inheritance. Why can't you see that Ginny Weasley is actually Lord Voldemort in disguise?"

"Don't be ridiculous, Harry. Everyone knows that Lord Voldemort does not have red hair. Ginny Weasley has red hair, and therefore could not possibly be Lord Voldemort."
