Oh, I really like the idea of a secret organization of wizards testing gifted Muggles to introduce them to the concepts of magic. Hell, how else would you keep and test forbidden Dark knowledge? /Only let the people who can't use magic learn about it./

VFD. The Vault of Forbidden Darkness. The secret room at the bottom of the Department of Mysteries. So dangerous is the knowledge that members must have their brains extracted toward the end of their lives, so that their ghosts can't spill the secrets. Those brains are so full of Dark knowledge that they come alive, lashing with caustic tentacles at any unsuspecting Weasley that falls into their grasp.

I like this a lot.
