I always thought ASoUE would fit nicely in the Potterverse. The VFD could be an offshoot of the Order, or reformed death eaters. The baudelaires could be wizards. The Mycelium would be a herbology project from hell. It doesn't even visit many real world locations, so all of the places the Baudelaires visit could be wizarding locations.
