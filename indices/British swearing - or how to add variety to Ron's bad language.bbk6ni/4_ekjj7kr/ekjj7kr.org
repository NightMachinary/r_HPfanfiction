I disagree with a lot of that list. Minging and munter were both acceptable to say in front of a teacher, which is the clearest definition of a swear word IMO.

And clunge was made up by The Inbetweeners as a fake word alternative to minge that could be said on TV - the whole purpose of it is that it isn't a swear word.

Equally, ginger? As a Scot I'm insulted.
