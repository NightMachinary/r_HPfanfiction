It's worth bearing in mind that with the more obscure swear words, rarely will anyone be using ALL of them. You're raised around a certain amount of them, and go onto to pepper your language with those. Eg. I say ‘prat', ‘twat', ‘prick' but have never gone round saying ‘pillock'. So don't over do it - pick a few funny ones and run with them for a character.
