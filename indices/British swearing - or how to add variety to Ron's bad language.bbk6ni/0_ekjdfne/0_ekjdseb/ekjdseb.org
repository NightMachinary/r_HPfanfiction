I supposed to do with context- it's Ofcom that's compiled this so they're talking about tv. Perhaps they're referring to ginger being used as an insult/slur, although I agree I raised my eyebrows at that. I would consider arse and bloody as very mild swear words though - wouldn't expect to hear them on cbbc for example!
