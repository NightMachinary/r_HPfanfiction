Where is "here" for you? Everywhere I've been in the UK (am English) considers "bastard" to be a pretty severe swearword. It's a word my parents would have slapped me for saying up until being about fifteen, and one I'd rebuke a child for saying now. I'd put it on a rough par with "shit", "bitch", at an estimate. If "fuck" is A-list, "bastard" would be B-list.

You're right about "ginger" though. Though gingers are the collective butt of a lot of jokes, so there's probably a "social justice" thing going on there.
