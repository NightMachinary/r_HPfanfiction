That's your own opinion though. I'm not offended by any particular swearwords - I consider them all simply to be words. I use a lot of harsh language in my own daily life... but then, I'm Northern. None of that changes what is and isn't profanity, though. A good measure of profanity is what would or wouldn't be acceptable to say to a child, or for them to say to you - and it's no more acceptable to call a child a "little bastard" than it would to call them a "piece of shit", "cockwomble", or "cunt".

Invariably? I knew a ginger girl at school, who grew up to be a huge whale with a bright orange afro. Not really beauty if you ask me :-P
