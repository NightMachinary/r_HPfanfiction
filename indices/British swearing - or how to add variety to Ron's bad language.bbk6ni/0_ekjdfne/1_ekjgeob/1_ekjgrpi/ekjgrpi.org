Cheltenham. As an adult it is really used in a humorous way as in â€˜ah you bastard!'. I would never use fuck in my day to day language nor shit, I'd rate bastard along with bollocks as a light, barely curse word. I don't actually use any of the words I'd rate as actual swearwords at all (fuck, shit, c-word etc).

And I've always been jealous of gingers, they invariably grow up to be beauties!
