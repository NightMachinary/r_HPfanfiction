That goes with a lot of things. Saying that my cousin is a dick (or a bastard, or a bitch, or a shithead) is probably going to elicit a laugh, but calling my boss even something as mild as a pansy (or a nancy, or a milquetoast little child) would get me fired with extreme prejudice although that would be extremely satisfying some days.
