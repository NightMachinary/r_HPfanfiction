That list omits the most important part: context. As a very simple example, were I to call a female colleague a "minger" I might well end up getting fired, but shouting "Fuck!" would probably make people laugh - unless clients were around. Like "minger", ginger, bint and munter are also insults rather than swearwords.

"Fuck" is so versatile. "The weather is fucking awful" will probably be allowed in most adult environments but "Fuck you!" wouldn't.

I have to say I'm surprised how spread out the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_dirty_words][Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television]] are: from Medium to Strongest.
