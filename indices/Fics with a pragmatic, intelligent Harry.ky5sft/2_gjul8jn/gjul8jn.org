Linkao3(A Journey to Emilio by Supermouse)

I'm offering this because in this story Harry is /very/ motivated to push his magic as far as he can make it go. I don't think it counts as bashing (Dumbledore pressuring Harry to stay with the Dursleys no matter what and being Very Keen to have Harry under his thumb are both canon and he isn't cackling or plotting evil or anything).

If you like the first three chapters or so (they're very short) you will probably like the rest, since it's all in the same style and stays in theme.
