There's no Dumbledore bashing in linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense), and although Harry has unusually large magical reserves, they are as much of a hindrance as a help; she just wants to brew potions, but being exceptional means that people like Tom Riddle want to manipulate and control her or just outright steal her magic, and her identity ruse is taking more spotlight than she planned for.

She is, however, very pragmatic indeed. Canon Harry was offered Slytherin; this Harry truly belongs there, because she has a goal - learning potions from Professor Snape - and she'll sacrifice whatever it takes to succeed and survive. She has a serious work ethic and is a born planner. Yet her friendships constantly struggle, as she can't fully trust and rely on her friends.

It's quite an original storyline, drawing inspiration from canon but completely reimagining it rather than just retelling it.
