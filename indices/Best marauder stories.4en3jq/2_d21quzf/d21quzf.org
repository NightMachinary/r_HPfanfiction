[[http://fictionhunt.com/read/7287445/1][All these Complications]]: An AU where Regulus lets Sirius know about the existence of horcruxes. One of my favorite fics ever.

linkffn(If I Die Young by Annie Lockwood) is one of my favorite romances. Fast paced (a lot of marauder era stories are overly bloated) and really good writing. WiP.

Also, linkffn(Fool Me Twice by DawnieS). James/Lily AU, lots of courtroom drama.
