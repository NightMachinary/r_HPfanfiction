linkffn(Tears on the Blacony) Probably the most definitive romance marauder era series. Lots and lots of drama. More than you can shake a stick at really.

linkffn(Against the Moon) A story that spans the entire time the marauders are at Hogwarts.

There isn't a whole lot of marauder stuff that isn't slash, wolfstar (Remus/Sirius) is a very popular pairing so it's very common to see it.
