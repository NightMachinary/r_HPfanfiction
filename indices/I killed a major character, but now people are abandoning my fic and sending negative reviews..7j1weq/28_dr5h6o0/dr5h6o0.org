Writing fanfiction doesn't provide you monetary gain or involves pressures of professional editing and publishing. Therefore, there is precisely zero reason for you to write anything except that which you like, or change your story to satisfy anonymous people online.

If you feel that someone's review gives you valuable insights related to the quality of your writing, characterization etc., then by all means take those to heart. I haven't read it, so I don't have any opinions on those. But you don't owe your readers, who can easily jump to another story, anything. Just as your readers don't owe you allegiance or have to go easy in their assessment.

Admittedly, I'm not an author, so I don't know firsthand what it's like to have your story read and judged by the multitude, but at the end of the day you are (I assume) an anonymous online writer and have the freedom to write just about anything imaginable. It would be a waste to succumb to crowd pleasing.
