You did not need to kill Hermoine to get that effect. You could have simply had her be badly injured and it would have made more sense. Your readers would still have gotten a better sense of the gravity of the situation as Harry would have. He would still have had a good reason to search for the stone and to train and study harder. He would also have had a reason to get to know the politics of the wizarding world . Hell, you could have had Ron or Harry himself injured badly to get the effect you wanted.

I literally hate stories where Hermoine is killed off this way so I would have read your story up until this point and then ditched it. I'd feel pretty much the same way about Ron or Harry dying this way.
