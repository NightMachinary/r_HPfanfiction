Doesn't matter to me at all. I could have done that without killing off anyone. (not to mention that an 11 year old Harry and "understanding of the politics of the Wizarding World" usually don't go together in my mind). And "being dead" and "having a central role" don't go together at all, unless you're talking about ghosts - and I'm not interested in a story with perpetually 12 year old ghost Hermione.
