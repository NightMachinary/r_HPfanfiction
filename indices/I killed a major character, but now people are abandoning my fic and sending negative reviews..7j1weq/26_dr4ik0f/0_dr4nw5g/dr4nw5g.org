That actually sort of makes sense.

But I stand by the death as needed for the story, it gives Harry a further incentive to train/study harder, gives him a reason to return to searching for the Stone, and gives him an understanding of the politics of the wizarding world.

And Hermione will actually have a more central role now that she's dead.
