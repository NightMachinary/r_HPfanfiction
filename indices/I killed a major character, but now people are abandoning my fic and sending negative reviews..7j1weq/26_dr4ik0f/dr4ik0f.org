I can understand people abandoning a story - as the dozens of pet peeves threads show, people abandon stories very quickly.

That said, I won't even start reading the story. Not just because I'm not interested in the kind of stories where Hermione gets killed off, but because I hate the "it was realistic" excuse. As the writer, you are in complete control of the story. If you don't want a character to die, they don't die. And since you wanted Hermione to die, I don't want to read your story.

But I wouldn't want to read your story even if you retconned it - since you wanted Hermione to die, you certainly cannot expected to give her a central role, so, once again: Not interested in the story.

That doesn't mean your story is bad or others shouldn't read it - just that I don^{t} have any interest in it.
