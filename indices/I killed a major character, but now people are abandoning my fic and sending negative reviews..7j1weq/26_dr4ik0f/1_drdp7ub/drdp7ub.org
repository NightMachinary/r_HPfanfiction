Tl;DR I REFUSE TO READ ANTI HERMIONE STORIES.\\
You didn't need to say anything, anyone would have guessed you'd refuse to read it.

  but because I hate the "it was realistic" excuse. As the writer, you are in complete control of the story. If you don't want a character to die, they don't die. And since you wanted Hermione to die, I don't want to read your story.

This is BS and leads right back into 'No Hermione, No Read' policy. A paragraph to say the same thing?
