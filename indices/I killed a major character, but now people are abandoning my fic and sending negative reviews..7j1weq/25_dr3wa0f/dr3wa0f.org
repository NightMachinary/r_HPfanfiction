It's a bit surprising the first time it happens, but often people don't really want to deal with things like that in fanfiction and are looking for a perfect world free of conflict. Don't change you're plan that'll make you hate the story. Relish it. Feed on it.

The meanest and cruelest reviews I've ever gotten were when I teased that Daphne might have slept with someone who wasn't Harry in a drunken night of rage. And they were hilarious to read. People have awful views of the world.

I honestly can't wait until I finish my current fic as I know what the reviews to the last few chapters are going to be already and I'm giggling waiting for them.
