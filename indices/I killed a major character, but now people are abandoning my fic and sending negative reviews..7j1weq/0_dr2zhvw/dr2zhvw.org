Oh, never change it. You have a story: you tell it how you wish. MOST readers will jeep reading and be GLAD that there are real stakes at play here.

Some readers are very very young, and don't pick up multiple layers of meaning; some readers never did very well at school, and might struggle with foreshadowing and the like; other readers are straight-up idiots, want to be contrary, and would happily read a fanfic where everything is apple pie and ice cream all the way through.

A well-executed character death is a great thing - don't feel bad for killing characters off. Once your story is finished, people may appreciate ut more.
