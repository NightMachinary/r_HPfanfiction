I haven't read your story so I can't comment on it specifically, but for me I'll abandon a fic when a MC is killed of is because:

1) I chose to read the fic specifically for that character i.e. wanted to see them explore the situation presented, so with them gone, my interest goes too.

2) The killing off of the character gives me insight into the way the author sees the characters/story as a whole that makes me feel it isn't going to be for me.

3) The killing off was stupid and nonsensical and makes the story less interesting/boxes it in for later chapters.
