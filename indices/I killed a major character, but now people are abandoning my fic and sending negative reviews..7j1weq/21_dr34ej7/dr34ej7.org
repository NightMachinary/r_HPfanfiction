I'll admit I can understand them, I had to stop reading SDDJ when one of the characters died. It was a really well executed death, but I'd grown really attached to the OC. Genuinely the only fanfic I've ever cried over. I might pick it up again and go past it but who knows. That being said, would I have wanted the author to do it differently? No, I'm sure the death was important to the plot, people die, it is war.
