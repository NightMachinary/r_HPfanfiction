Do not change the story but maybe put a warning at the start of the story that there will be major character death. Because some people (myself included) do not want to read a story where the main character, love interest or parental figure kicks the bucket halfway in. Foreshadowing in nice and good but you can miss it quite easily on the first readthrough. I mean by now most people know about the Red Wedding but are still caught off-guard when they get to that part.
