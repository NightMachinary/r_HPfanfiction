I have mixed feelings about the warning. I don't like the "spoiler" aspect of it in the sense I'm constantly wondering who is going to die, but I can understand not wanting to read about a certain character dying. My personal feeling is if I'm committed to the story and it's well-written, I may be totally gutted at one character's death, but I'm going to keep reading because that makes the story what it is.
