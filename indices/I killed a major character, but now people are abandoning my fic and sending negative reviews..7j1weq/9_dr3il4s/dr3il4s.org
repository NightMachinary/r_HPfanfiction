I would advise you to write the story you want to write, unless you're only writing for approval. You think George R.R. Martin didn't get hate mail for the Red Wedding?

Personally: Yeah, I'm never reading your story. I hate when that happens in HP fanfiction. I am definitely one of those readers who is mainly here for fixfics. I've dropped other stories for the exact same reason people are dropping yours. Sometimes it doesn't matter how good the writing is if you don't care where the story goes next.
