There are three large pitfalls with this. Two of them are objective problems and two are contextual problems.

- You're invoking the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffedIntoTheFridge][Stuffed in the Fridge]] trope unless you handle it exceptionally well. Even if you /do/ handle it exceptionally well, your readers have experienced dozens of bad examples before reading your fic, and that means it's hard for you to make it work.
- HP canon is skewed male. DCU canon is skewed male. Unless you put in a lot of effort, you're killing off one of the only female characters you have available.
- Hermione is a widely loved character.

My personal rules for killing off major characters are:

- Their death should emphasize their agency, not their helplessness.
- Their death should reflect their character.
- They should get a Crowning Moment of glory / awesome / what have you in it.
- They should not have been the only character in a minority group that was significantly present in the story. (There's a trope about lesbians on TV shows -- they never last more than a season before they're killed off. Brooklyn 99 had to explicitly warn viewers in advance that their new queer couple wouldn't be killed.)
