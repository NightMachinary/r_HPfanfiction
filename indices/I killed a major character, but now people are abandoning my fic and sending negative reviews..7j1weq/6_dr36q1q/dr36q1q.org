You should definitely carry on the way you originally intended. If I learned anything from watching Glee it was that pandering to fans /never/ ends well.

That said, do you have a content warning that there is going to be a major character death? You said it was heavily foreshadowed but sometimes readers don't pick up on the clues. I know that (especially these days) I'm not looking to read a story with a major character death (this goes double for a character who didn't die in canon). I would never write a bad review because of it, but I wouldn't be inclined to read the story.
