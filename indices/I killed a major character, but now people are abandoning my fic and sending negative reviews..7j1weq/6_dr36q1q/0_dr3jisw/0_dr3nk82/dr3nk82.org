Pretty much the same as you, I tapped out 5/6 episodes into season 4 but watched the season 5 episode right after Cory died and like 3 or 4 in the final season just to get some closure.

Between Cory's death and Mark (Puck) and Naya (Santana) turning out to be bad news I can't even watch the reruns anymore.

I definitely just pretend the show ended after 3 seasons though.
