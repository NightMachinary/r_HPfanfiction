[Spoilers EVERYTHING]

The death of a major character has to be done in a good way.

Losing against the arch nemesis and not getting away is a good way.

Getting betrayed by someone you treated misserably all your life is a good way.

Slipping on the staircase is a bad way, it reeks of drama for dramas sake.

It's a scale, your hermoine vs troll fight is in my oppinion a bit more on the stair case side of the scale.
