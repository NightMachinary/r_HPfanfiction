Keep in mind, for every 1 person flipping out, there are likely tons more reading it who are not. Major character death tends to cause this so its perfectly normal. People connect with or love a certain character and if they die... well... they get upset. Imagine the backlash after some of the character deaths in the HP books, Sirius especially. Guaranteed JK got some hate mail although by that point it was probably screened out via her publisher so she never actually saw it lol.

Keep writing, it will pass.
