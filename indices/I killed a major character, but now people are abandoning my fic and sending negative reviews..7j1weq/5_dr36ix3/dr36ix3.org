So what? It's you story, you tell it how you want to tell it.

Any reader who feel entitled to a certain ending or a certain story direction should just write their own story and stop bothering you.

Besides, maybe you loose some readers now, but might be appreciated by far more readers for this in the future. The backlash now doesn't mean the story is going to be liked any less in the long run. In cases like this I can easily see the opposite happening.
