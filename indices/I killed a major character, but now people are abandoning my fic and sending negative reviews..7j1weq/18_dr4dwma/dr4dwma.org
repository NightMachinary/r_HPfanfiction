Seems like you came here for vindication and got it.

For another perspective, ask yourself if you gain more from killing off the character than keeping her in. I've found the outcome doesn't need to be positive, so much as leave your readers satisfied.

If the death achieved something, even if just for shock value, great. If you left people thinking, 'well, that was pointless,' you can expect a backlash. Take heart that at least it means your readers are emotionally invested, even if you can't read them as well as you'd like.
