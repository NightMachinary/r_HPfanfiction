It's your story, your choices. That being said, that seems a pretty lazy/uninspired way of killing off that character. I haven't read the rest of your story, so I can't understand the context, but I anticipate I'd be somewhat annoyed too.

However, being about to promote a visceral fan reaction is probably a good thing.
