I would argue Rowling didn't make the goblins one dimensional. Of course, we only see it from Harry's perspective, which is limited, but I think it's there. In book seven, we get a glimpse into a complex world of goblins: their own history and customs with regard to ownership, but also their inner disagreements. Bill mentions that only a faction of goblins believe in ownership of items not passing down with inheritence. The goblins in the woods traveling with Dean and overheard by the group demonstrate different goblin perspectives on Voldemort, from being interested in what rights he could give them that other wizards haven't, to being sceptical of their role as a lesser race, to feeling that neither side respect goblins or their interests. The OP here describes goblins as being "ruthless businessmen and warriors "-- but neither of these are really supported in canon. Firstly: they own the bank, yes, but it's not clear that they are "ruthless." Hagrid warns Harry not to double cross them in book 1, which turns out to be good advice, but isn't that true of everyone? And much that we hear about goblins is from wizards, who are prejudice against them. Secondly, are they ruthless warriors? Hermione makes it clear that they are not more or less ruthless than wizards. I see Griphook as a complex character. He wants to believe Harry is capable of respecting a promise to a goblin, but when he is ultimately proved wrong, as he always suspected and feared that he would be, he has no problem returning the favor.
