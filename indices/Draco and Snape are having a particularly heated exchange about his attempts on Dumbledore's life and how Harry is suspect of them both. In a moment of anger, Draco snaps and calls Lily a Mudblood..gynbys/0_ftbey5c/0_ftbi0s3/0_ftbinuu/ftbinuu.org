You know, I find it funny that the Dursleys insulted Harry's parents more than Draco did, at least so far as I can recall.

Draco said they came to a bad end for making the wrong choice, but that's not an insult.

On the other hand, Marge insulted his mother, "If there's something wrong with the /bitch/ there's something wrong with the pup."

I swear, Marge is probably the only person I want to punch more than Umbridge.
