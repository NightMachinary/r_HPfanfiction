People are afraid of things they don't know and Vernon knew very little about magic. Perhaps he thought it evil. So MAYBE you could say that how he acted towards Harry was him trying to protect his family from it and maybe Harry himself too (stopping him from going to Hogwarts)? This is a real longshot.

And he must have been good at his job, since they lived in Surrey ( I understand it's expensive). Does that count for anything, lol?
