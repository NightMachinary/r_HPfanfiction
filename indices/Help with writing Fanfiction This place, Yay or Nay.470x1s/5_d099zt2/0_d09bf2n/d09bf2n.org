This subreddit is good for canon/fanon discussion as well as reviewing/reading, but it's not as good for writing help. There is [[/r/FanFiction]] which seems to be more oriented around writing, as well as reading, and the difficulties encountered therein.

If you want to throw around some ideas in real time or just have a bit of a chat, come over to our IRC channel ##hpfanfiction (there's a link in the sidebar.)
