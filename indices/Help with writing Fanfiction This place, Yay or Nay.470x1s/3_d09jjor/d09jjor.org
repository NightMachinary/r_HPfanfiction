Right now you've got the barest idea, so your next move is to think hard about what interesting changes come from that moment of divergence---preferably ones you haven't read before.

I try to stick as close to the canon /tone/ as possible, because that's part of what I love about the books, but you kind of have to stray from the canon plot when you do one of these divergence fics, just because other people have already covered the ground on any of the common points.

I don't read Draco-centric fics because I don't like the guy, so this may be extremely common. But the question that comes to mind for me right away is: This doesn't make him any less of a bigot, right? Harry is much more likely to be the one influenced by Draco than the other way around since he's the one being assimilated into the culture, which means your heroes are both bigots. Which is interesting, but I don't see how you get to very many canon plot points with such a different Harry. So every time you're about to rope a canon plot point in, think, "Is it really possible for this to happen with my characters as they exist now? If it isn't, what happens instead?"

Don't underestimate this: /Nearly everything/ is affected by this change. If nothing else, on a very basic, cynical level, JKR relies on Hermione constantly for plot advancement: Much of what happens is driven by Hermione being a smarter, more driven researcher than anybody else.

Sure, you can just make somebody else a really smart and driven researcher, but at that point why diverge from canon at all? How would Harry and his complacent, drawling Slytherin friends reach their goals, and how would those goals differ from Harry, Ron, and Hermione's?
