Remember, you don't have to follow canon completely in things that normally wouldn't change despite the divergence. Not all of the horcruxes must be in the same place, or only destroyable by the same things, and the obstacles in the Philosopher's Stone don't have to be the same. This is one thing which 99.99% of fics ignore, and it's just a canon rehash with different characters and relationships then.
