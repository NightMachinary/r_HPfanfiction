I don't read Draco/Hermione but for some reason it doesn't really bug me. I've read a couple with that as a background pairing (I mostly read Harry-centric). But for some reason I just can't stand Draco/Ginny. I don't care if others like it. Everyone has their preferences but I just can't read it and I don't know why. Maybe because I'm I'm a huge Harry/Ginny fan? Idk.
