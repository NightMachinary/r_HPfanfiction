When it comes to discussing canon, you're definitely at the right spot.

When it comes to discussing Slytherin!Harry, yea... maybe. Not the most original thing, so enthusiasm might be low.

If this is becoming a Drarry, you may want to change forums. As far as I can see, there aren't much fans of that here.
