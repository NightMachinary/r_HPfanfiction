I feel like in the right circumstances, if Draco and Harry became friends at Madam Malkin's Robes, then Harry might have been looking for Draco on the train and never met Ron until after the sorting. By that point, Harry would probably be a Slytherin. Even if Harry realizes Draco is a bully by that point, his house is set. Or maybe Ron comes across as the bully because Harry is more sympathetic to Draco.
