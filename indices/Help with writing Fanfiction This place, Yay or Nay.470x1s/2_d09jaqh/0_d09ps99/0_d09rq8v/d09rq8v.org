  Even if Harry realizes Draco is a bully by that point, his house is set.

I'd read that fic. Harry seeks out Draco on the train, but doesn't find him. Listens to the Sorting Hat telling him he could be great in Slytherin + Draco just went there...and then he finds out that Draco's a jerk, and people like Ron don't want to make friends anymore because he's a Slytherin.
