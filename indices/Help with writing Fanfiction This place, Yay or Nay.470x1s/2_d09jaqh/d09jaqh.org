Feel free to post a link to a Google doc with your first chapter. Or PM me if you'd like. I'm always up for reviewing stories.

I've gotta say, though, that this:

#+begin_quote
  Draco doesn't make an ass of himself when getting fitted for robes. This leads to him properly befriending Harry.
#+end_quote

doesn't follow for me. Even if Draco hadn't shown his bigotry so early in Madam Malkin's Robes For All Occasions, it wouldn't have mattered. Draco was quite cruel to Ron on the Hogwarts Express by mocking what was most important to Harry: having a loving family. I /really/ liked this scene in PS because it showed us something unique in three very different characters in a wonderfully concise manner. Draco demonstrated that not only is it important to him that a person be of 'proper' lineage, but they should /also/ have the 'right' views on what makes someone worthy of being a member of magical society (e.g. being a bigot). Ron got embarrassed at his family's poverty and angry at Draco's taunts. Harry rebuffed Draco's attempts at friendship thanks in no small part to his experiences with another bully: Dudley Dursley.

You're going to have a very difficult time convincing the reader that Draco and Harry are capable of being friends in a PS divergence.
