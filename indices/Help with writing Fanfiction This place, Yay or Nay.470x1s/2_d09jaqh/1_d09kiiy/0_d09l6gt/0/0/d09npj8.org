  Unless Harry is more politically inclined and sees that being friends with Draco is an easy tool to gain that power he desires?

I agree that this could be a compelling motivation. It might lead to a very different Harry who uses the bigotry of others to bring about reforms. This would be difficult to do, though, as the protagonist is still eleven-years-old and I can't imagine magical Parliament bending to the whims of a Hogwarts student. Harry has also never shown much of a drive to seize power, so he'd need an extremely compelling reason (e.g. imminent threat) to have such a drastic change to his canon personality.
