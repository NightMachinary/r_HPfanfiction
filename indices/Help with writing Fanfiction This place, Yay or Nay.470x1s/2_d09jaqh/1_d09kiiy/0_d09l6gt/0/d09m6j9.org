But, if Harry has no practice in defending himself from bullies, would he be less willing to argue against those with conflicting ideals? This Harry would have very little experience in confrontation, after all.

In the AU I described, I think it would be normal for a child to desperately just want his family to /notice/ him. To finally stop ignoring him. This trait can manifest differently depending on how the OP would like the direction to go, but it's not a far stretch to presume that a naive Harry could believe more power = more likely to be noticed. Though, I agree that Draco's bigotry would probably still make Harry angry. You're right on that. Even in this scenario Harry would want to prove that no matter his heritage or history, he can still be worthy of attention and friends- even if he is unable to vocalize this at the time. Hm. Unless Harry is more politically inclined and sees that being friends with Draco is an easy tool to gain that power he desires? That would need a whole other butterfly though and I'm pretty sure it's been done before.
