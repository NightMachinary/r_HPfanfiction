Eh, I'm not certain Harry would ever have this thought. It seems sycophantic and I think that would be OOC for him. On the first train ride, we see that Harry is capable of disagreeing with bullies right to their faces, even if he's outnumbered. That tells me that Harry would rather risk losing a fight for speaking his mind than cave in to conventional 'wisdom.'

I think your other point about Dudley's early behaviour has a lot of merit. It's one of the small things an author could change early in their AU divergence that would drastically alter how Harry Potter tackles conflict. I don't think that a less confrontational Dudley would make Harry willing to give Draco's worldview any credence, though. At that point, would he still be Harry Potter?
