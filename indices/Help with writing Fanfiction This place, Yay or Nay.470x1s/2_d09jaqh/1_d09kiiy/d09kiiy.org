Well, that would be an interesting idea though. What if Dudley hadn't been a bully? Assuming he picked up that behavior from his father, that's where the "one change" would need to happen. The Dursleys as a whole could have simply completely ignored Harry (thus keeping him with an undesirable home life) and that could give [[/u/Dezmar-sama][u/Dezmar-sama]] enough wiggle room to alter/enhance certian personality traits with Harry. It could also allow for the thought of, "Maybe I just wasn't worthy? Perhaps Draco can teach me how to be worthy." Or something.
