I do try to make things interesting without going all Mary Sue territory... Sometimes I do have to scrap ideas because they are just too... "Perfect" in world.. I like making Harry arrogant, I like having him more reserved than Canon. He's conflicted about the people he calls friends, because of the first war. He's upset about the rest of the world looking to him as some sort of savior hanging out with "the wrong sort". He's weary of Dumbledore instead of trusting and compliant. I try to make it so that anything and everything that happens happens as it did in Canon unless Harry being in Slytherin could/would affect that.
