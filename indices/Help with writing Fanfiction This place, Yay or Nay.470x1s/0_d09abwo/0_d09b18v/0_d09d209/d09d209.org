Don't bother sticking to canon. Most people who've read fanfic knows exactly what happened as canon, and would as such likely skip sections that merely reiterates canon from a slightly different viewpoint. Well, I assume so. I generally just avoid fics like that altogether.

Instead, butterflies. Butterflies are the bread and butter of good fanfics. We want to see how you can twist canon until we can recognize what's going on, but don't know for certain what's going to happen next. See if you can put in a scene where something seemingly irrelevant is discussed, only for it to have huge consequences a year or so later. Have Lucius discover how the Dursleys treated Harry (but avoid blowing it out of proportion), and use that to discredit Dumbledore, rendering the dairy forgotten. Instead, do something like having Harry stumble across the Room of Requirements, and have one of his friends put on the Diadem, and carry out an old plot of Voldemort's. These are just examples, mind.

By all means, focus on how your Harry differs from the one in canon, but make sure that you don't leave your readers bored in-between divergent moments, and most of all, keep them guessing as to what actions will change things utterly, and what will end up the same, despite all the butterflies.
