Yes. I have a fic which on paper sounds very good but I question if I can write it.

The basic premise is the Ministry is controlling everyone like a dystopia. And Ootp and DE are two rebel groups that fight each other and the ministry.

Sorting hat knows a way to end the civil war and finds Harry Potter a expelled student from Hogwarts, and they have a journey together with more characters joining to make a sort of group.

In the end Harry would sacrifice himself to save the day from a cross dimensional ritual to stop the bad guy (who is not Voldemort) who wants to rule all universes.

Think of Harry like Solo from Star Wars. I have it all planned out and even a sequel.
