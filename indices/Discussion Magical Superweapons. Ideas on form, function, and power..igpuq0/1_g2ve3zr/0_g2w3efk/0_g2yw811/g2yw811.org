Dementors can't be destroyed but apparently they can't pass through solid objects like walls and their hovering is limited to a bit faster than running speed. Those are pretty major weaknesses, so it should be totally doable to catch them, then once they're immobilized just launch them into deep space. Muggles could probably do it if they could see Dementors; hunt them down riding on motorbikes that are faster than Dementors and catch them with lassos, then put them into solid steel cages and mount them on top of an Atlas or a Delta. If one cage containing a Dementor weighs around 140 kg, a single Delta IV Heavy should be capable of sending 100 of them towards a rendezvous with Venus at once.
