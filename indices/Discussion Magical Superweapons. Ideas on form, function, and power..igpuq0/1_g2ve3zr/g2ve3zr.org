While it is not mentioned in the books, Rowling later explained (on Pottermore or something else) that the British Ministry of Magic "discovered" the island of Azkaban after the death of its previous occupant, the Dark Wizard Ekrizdis, died and the protections failed.

Since the Dementors were already present on the island when the Ministry went to investigate, and that we do not have any other informations about this specie, it is not impossible that the Dementors were a "magical weapon" created by Ekrizdis. If it was the case, I think that a bunch of unkillable, soul sucking monster who generate an aura of despair qualify as "Superweapon".
