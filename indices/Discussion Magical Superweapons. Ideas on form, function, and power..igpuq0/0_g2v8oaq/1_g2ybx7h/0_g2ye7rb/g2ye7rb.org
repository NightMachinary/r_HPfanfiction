Nundu's breath carries death and disease, and a magical one at that if it can wipe out dozens of wizards and their villages.

It's certainly far more effective at killing wizards who possess an innate resiliency to mundane poisons.

A lot of assumptions about the effectiveness of muggle protective equipment against magical disease, given how conceptual and powerful magic is in canon. You can drink a potion to cure disease, close a wound with a flick of a wand, teleport and conjure matter, but it's dragon pox, a magical disease, that poses a real threat.

Additionally, the effectiveness of chemical weapons is constantly overestimated by people. They're more psychological and mutual destruction via contamination. Delivery of chemical weapons via artillery renders a percent ineffective. It took hours to build up the concentration to start killing people en masse in the Iraqi attack.

They're a poor man's nuke; they leave long term consequences wherever they're employed. They're good at killing muggle civilians, honestly pretty bad at killing soldiers, and would be completely ineffectual against wizards who are highly resistant to chemicals. Muggle bioweapons would be more effective as wizards can still get infected, even if they might be able to easily cure them.
