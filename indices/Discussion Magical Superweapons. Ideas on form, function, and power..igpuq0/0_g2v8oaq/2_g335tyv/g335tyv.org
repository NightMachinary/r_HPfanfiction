Nundu aren't exactly common though, and it would be incredibly difficult to safely collect their breath for use as a bioweapon. On the other hand, mandrakes would be terrifyingly effective when properly deployed.

As for the killing curse, I dislike it because, in my opinion, it's a boring piece of magic. Instant death for anyone you hate enough to cast it. If it was nearly impossible to cast, even for most of the more talented Death Eaters, I'd like it more. It would emphasise how vile Voldemort is that he is capable of tossing them out like candy. As is though, why even use other spells on enemies when you can just cast several of those at them until they can't dodge any more. Just my personal opinion.
