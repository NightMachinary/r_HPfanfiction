Mandrakes and fwoopers. Better than a basilisk really, since it works by sound and can work around corners and walls. Nundu's breath is the wizarding bioweapon which seems similar to your Breath of Morpheus, only it kills instantly. These are all canonical (or not all, depending on whether you count pottermore and the fanastic beast book).

I'm not sure why you dislike the killing curse, but I actually quite like it.
