Don't recall the fwoopers, but mandrakes most definitely. Anyone close enough to hear dies. Drop one of those in a crowded place, and you're talking probably hundreds dead.

Put one in front of a live TV or radio broadcast, and potentially millions (unless it has to be heard directly by the ear for some magical reason).
