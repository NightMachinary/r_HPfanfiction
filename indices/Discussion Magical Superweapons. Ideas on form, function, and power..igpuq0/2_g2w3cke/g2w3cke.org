AK is signifcant because its (mostly) magically unblockable, and because it requires a malevolent state of mind to use. Its not a WMD, no.

I think that equating the basilisk's power to a nuke is a bit much. You have to look it directly in the eyes, and sooner or later they'd figure out to clear the area and just gas it or shoot it from the air.

A Nundu would be worse- probably faster than a basilisk, and poison breath. Its never been taken down by less than a hundred wizards IIRC.

Fiendfyre, deployed in a dense urban environment without warning, or at a major event, could kill thousands, perhaps tens of thousands.

I've often thought about portkeying explosives or poisons into a place for a surprise attack.
