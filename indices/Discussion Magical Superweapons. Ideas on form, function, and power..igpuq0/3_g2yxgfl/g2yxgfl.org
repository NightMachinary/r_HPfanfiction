How about the Vanishing spell? It can be cast in modified forms to vanish exactly what you want gone while not affecting what you want to keep. Cast it at some uranium ore, removing everything but U-235 and you can easily make weapons grade fissile material.

Now a switching charm can be used to effectively teleport items between fixed positions, very handy for instantly assembling a critical mass. No need for complicated explosive lensing.

Combine that magic nuclear weapon with a portkey, and you effectively have an untraceable ICBM. Your enemy's place might be charmed against arriving portkeys, but you don't really need to hit it exactly when you're sending a literal nuke.

Pretty much any skilled wizard with a decent knowledge of spells and a few months or years studying nuclear physics could pull it off. That's easy enough that there's a sizeable danger that some psycho might actually do it.
