I think it came from something old (Star Trek maybe) where in the fandom 2 male characters were usually paired as either good friends or as partners, and slash or no-slash (as in the slash between names in a ship) was used to identify between the two. After that, it just sort of became used for male/male.

Edit: so I scrolled down and I'm apparently right.
