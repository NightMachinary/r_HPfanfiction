So I did some digging, and I'm pretty sure that it start back when Star Trek was popular, and particularly fics featuring Kirk and Spock.

Kirk+Spock friendship fics were referred to as Kirk&Spock, shorthand &\\
Kirk+Spock homoerotic fics were referred to as Kirk/Spock, shorthand /

For a while, known as 'virgule', the proper literary term for /, then changed to the slang 'slash'. From there, the term migrated to indicate all homoerotic fic, and femslash/femmeslash got started to refer to lesbian ships.
