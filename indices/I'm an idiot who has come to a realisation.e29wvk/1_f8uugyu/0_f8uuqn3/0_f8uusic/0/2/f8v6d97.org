It's out of a need to differentiate for finding stories, probably. Like how my favorite pairing is often a side pairing, and it's harder to find it as the main one, I have to sift through other stuff. Fics of lesbian relationships are just more rare, so harder to find if all under 'slash.'

Some sites call it femmeslash.
