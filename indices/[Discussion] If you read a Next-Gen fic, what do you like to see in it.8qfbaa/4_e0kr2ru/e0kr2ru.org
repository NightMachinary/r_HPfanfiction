No overprotective parents! We are talking about a generation that fought a war and that can lead to that (wanting to protect your kids from having to go through that!), but I for one HATE overprotective helicopter parents (who at worst spy on their kids and make them wear GPS tags (a tracking charm in HP), have spy-software on their devices (PC, laptop, tablet, cellphone etc.) and block websites they don't agree with and (even worse) search their kid's room, schoolbag etc. regularly...etc. etc. (add other NSA-Spook things here, like going through people's trash etc.!)) with a passion and would love to deport them all to an island where they can spend each day spying on each other (note: I'd keep the kids here!) so that they feel watched, judged etc. all the time (and learn that this is not ok and that even kids have a right to privacy! I mean if a kid trusts you, then said kid will come to you if it faces problems it can't handle by itself!)

Good romances (maybe even some that piss the parents off!), some danger and mystery (and no parents coming to the rescue all the time!).

Also: Disagreements with the parents (I'd love a kid who knows everything their parents did during the war and disagrees with them on the how and maybe even on the why! Example: A kid of Harry that thinks their 'crux-hunt with the tent is the stupidest idea ever, especially in a world with the fidelius charm and other concealment spells! Hell a kid that thinks Voldemort wasn't so wrong (disagreeing with what he did maybe, but not why he did it and not with his end-goals!) would also be cool!)

ps: Ich habe fertig :) (translation: I am done) - Sadly I haven't seen many (if any) good next-gen fanfiction (especially since I kind of dislike that the old "heroes" kind of get the Luke Skywalker treatment - "Out with the old, in with the new and if we have to kill "the past" in order to do it!"...not to mention that I think them marrying that early and having kids is so unrealistic (especially for someone like Hermione! She's muggleborn and most of us muggles don't have kids till we are in our thirties (if at all! I mean I myself don't have any and don't want any either!))
