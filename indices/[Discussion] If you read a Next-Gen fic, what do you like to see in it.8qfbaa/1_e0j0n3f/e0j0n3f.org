Definitetly dealing with the fame of their parents is one of my favourite aspects of many Next-Gen stories.

I also like them being their own people and not just mere imitations of their parents. Additionally, their years at Hogwarts should be their own thing rather than just a Harry Potter repeat.

They should have friends outside of each other as I personally think it's a bit boring to have only their relatives as friends. I think that they should have some form of conflict with some of the members of their wider family as well.

An improved Ministry, expansion on the wider world and magic is also something I prefer.
