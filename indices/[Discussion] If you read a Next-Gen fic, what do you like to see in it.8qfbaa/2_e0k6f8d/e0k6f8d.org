I don't see why you can't have a next gen story and ignore bits of the epilogue.That being said, what I would like to see is if they feel the weight of the world's expectation. How have their parent's dealt with that. Some rich kids know they can get away with anything because of who their fathers are and go off the rails. Some, like the royal family have the importance of who they are drilled into them and tend to be respectful people. Could a parent hide their past from their own children? Do the kids know what to expect?
