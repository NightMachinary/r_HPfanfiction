I agree. I always wondered why Albus was the one who was cursed and not James, him being the eldest. I know a lot of people do stick him in that box of being like his grandfather, but very few develop him into a three dimensional character with actual human feelings, rather than presenting him as just an arrogant arsehole, with a crush on a girl he can't get.
