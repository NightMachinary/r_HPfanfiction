I've never understood why people focus on Al because it would be /James/ who would be feeling the most pressure. Based on the Epilogue, both he and Lily are forced into boxes where they're expected to be their namesakes. Al, on the other hand, is allowed to be himself. This story, while told from his POV, won't actually about /him/. I also ignore all information published after DH and sorted the kids based on the characteristics presented in the Epilogue, so Al is definitely /not/ in Slytherin. The only thing I take from CC is that Harry is distant from his other children and focuses most of his attention on Al because we got hints of that in the Epilogue, too.
