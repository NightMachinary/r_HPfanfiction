I have been working on a Next-Gen fic for many years now, and I write James as stuggling to live up to his father's reputation. I think it's interesting to see how parentage affects how the kids act and their relationships with other people and how they are treated.

I like to acknowledge the Epilogue as a base for the newly introduced characters, and have elected to ignore the Cursed Play.
