Were you by any chance inspired by SCP? It has a very similar vibe.

What does the dementia actually feed on while the person is trapped? And what happens when they cannot feed? (They cannot move, after all.)

It sounds like a Dementia feeds off the mind while the Dementor feeds on the soul? Maybe together they feed on all three (the body, also). I remember reading an absolutely horrifying vision of dementors in [[/spoiler][https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7713063/1/Elizium-for-the-Sleepless-Souls]] which might help you with ideas.

What would the combined form be called?
