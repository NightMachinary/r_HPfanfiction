Secure contain protect? Not directly but i have read their stuff before so it could be ancillary.

I would think as a minor(?) demon, they're immortal and only need to feed to reproduce when the male half is there. I like the feeding on body bit. Perhaps as it feeds, it turns the embraced into a new child. OOH. And because their soul was removed by the dement, they want A NEW ONE. But because they can't have one anymore, they jist steal others'.

I tried reading that before but was unimpressed. I'll try again.

A dement, I should think.
