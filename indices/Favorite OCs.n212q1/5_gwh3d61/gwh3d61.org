It's still sadly unfinished and seems destined to remain that way, but the best OCs in the fandom are Merlin, Rahn, Rahji and Ayati from linkffn(A Long Journey Home by Rakeesh). Those characters take on a life of their own.

Titus Button in TE7's various stories, most especially linkffn(Vitam Paramus) is another great OC. Always the friend who's there no matter what happens. A voice of reason amongst more emotional characters.
