I quite enjoy Rose Peta-Lorrum from Harry Potter and the Girl in Red. It's a D&D fic in the vein of Harry Potter and the Natural 20, but that follows a similar starts-whimsical-then-rapidly-descends-into-darkness path to canon. The series description says it all, really:

#+begin_quote
  An innocent, delicate flower is ripped from her home and dropped into a world where nothing makes sense. Armed with her intelligence and imaginary friend, and owning nothing but the magical clothes on her back (and anything that will fit in her picnic basket), Rose Peta-Lorrum must now survive the trials of the Rowling Plane.

  Warning: Starts out light and cracky, but gets darker the farther in you get.
#+end_quote

(Rose is neither innocent nor delicate)
