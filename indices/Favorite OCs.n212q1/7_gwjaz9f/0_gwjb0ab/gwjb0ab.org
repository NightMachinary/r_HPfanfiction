  The fiasco at the Department of Mysteries sent Harry to the late 19th century. Stuck in this farce of home, who can he really rely on? And should he really trust this Albus Dumbledore? Harry swore he was going to go back to 1996 and save his friends and everybody in his time whose existence is being threatened. But how? At what price? And what will be left of him in the end? HP/AD
