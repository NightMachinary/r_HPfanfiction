The /Second String/ definitely comes to mind for this since it is full of OCs and 'blank slate' characters like Griselda Marchbanks and Caradoc Dearbon. I loved the OCs in this, especially Pel and the barflies. I liked that all the OCs were real-seeming adults, not kids, and each was given real characterization. Other than Pel, I loved Dalcopp, the drunken lift repairman (based, I think, on the character Norm from the old sitcom "Cheers"), who could have been a throw-away character or there just for easy laughs but by the end was tragic and heroic and human in a really touching way. linkao3(15465966).
