  All of Wizarding Britain suffered in the war, but few suffered more than Hermione Granger. After over a decade away, the brightest witch of her age is returning to England to take a position at Hogwarts. But although Hermione survived the war, she isn't quite the person she once was. While Hermione struggles to find happiness in her new life, some of her most treasured companions struggle to come to terms the ways their old friend has changed. In the end, whether with old friends, old enemies, or new proteges, this fic follows Hermione as she (hopefully) learns that she still has people in her corner, even after all these years.
