As far as the "blank slate" characters, the Daphne Greengrass of "What's Her Name in Hufflepuff?", linkao3(22283053), is one of my favorites. She can talk to turtles. And she knows a very useful spell for identifying rocks.

I'll also say the Albus Severus Potter in "Progress, Not Perfection" is an excellent depiction of what a toxic little shit a teenaged boy from a privileged family will always be.

As for purely original OCs, I jave a huge soft spot for Gemma Rees of Loose Cannon, linkao3(26804215), which is teeming with great OCs (Lucinda Bellamy nee Spoonwocket is another great one).

La Pantera from Accidental Animagus, linkao3(14078862) is an excellent Dark Lady OC.
