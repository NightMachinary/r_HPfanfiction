I found these two which aren't really A/B/O but good anyways.

This first story is very well written. I loved the characterization of Fenrir in that. Of course it was a bit ooc but very good. (Werewolves and Wizards don't mix) Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8434153]])

The second fic is not to everyones liking but it's written well enough so I linked it too Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/899336]])
