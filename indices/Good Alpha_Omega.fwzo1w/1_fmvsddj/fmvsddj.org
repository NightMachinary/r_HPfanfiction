I absolutely love A/B/O fics. Unfortunately I am reading in a lot of other fandoms and it's been some time since I've been reading A/B/O fics in the HP fandom. I like to think that my taste in writing has improved over the years and thus my bookmarks in terms of A/B/O in the HP fandom are not the best. Nontheless. Here are the two fanfics which I think you might like.

One is 30k the other one 16k. Sorry that i couldn't find anything longer.
