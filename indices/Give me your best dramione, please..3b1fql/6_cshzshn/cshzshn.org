My three favourite dramione stories:

- linkffn(lost images by evilgu) <- this was the first Dramione I read.
- linkffn(vengeance by elizaye)
- linkffn(the die by colubrina)

These Dracos might be a bit too nice for you (especially the last one), but I really liked them. I haven't read half of the stories you mentioned yet, so I will check those out myself, thank you for those :).
