The Fallout is beautifully written - I haven't read it in ~3 years or so (actually, that sounds like it's about time for a re-read!), but I remember the prose being lovely. Gravity is my favorite redeemed!Draco. And I've read We Learned the Sea like 3 times... I think it's a great fic that doesn't white-wash Draco's past. It's another redemption fic too, but I definitely think it has its darker elements.
