Well, you've read all my stuff it seems, so I'm going to drop a bit of a random one: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10473466/1/Fate-be-Changed][Fate be Changed by Araciel]].

It's a bit random because it's barely a crossover. It calls itself a crossover, but it's a 'Harry reincarnated as a girl Hobbit who can barely even remember her former life' crossover. However, the characterisation is just done with so much love and attention that I found myself unable to not love it.
