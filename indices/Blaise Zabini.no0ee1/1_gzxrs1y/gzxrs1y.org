In canon, he's a he. But we didn't know that at the time. Pretty sure his gender wasn't confirmed until book five?

Personally, I thought Blaise was a girl because of a character in another series from that time period. (Who was, incidentally, also a witch). Don't remember which book, but it was the night world by LJ Smith, of vampire diaries infamy. You know, the series that was supposed to have a finale during Y2K and we're. Still. Waiting. Gah!
