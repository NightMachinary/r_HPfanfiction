Blaise Zabini appeared for the 1st time in the "Philosopher Stone" (where he was the last student to be Sorted), but only his name was mentioned there and his gender was not known until "Half Blood Prince" (since Blaise is technically a neutral name). During this period, Blaise was often used as the "Nice Slytherin's girl" that can show Harry that not all the Slytherin are bad (pretty much the same role that is now played by Daphne Greengrass).

Most of the fics with a female Blaise are ancient fics from that time. But even if the character lost a part of his popularity (being replaced by others), some people still want to write about him, and some also wants to write him as a girl (sometimes as an hommage to these old fics).
