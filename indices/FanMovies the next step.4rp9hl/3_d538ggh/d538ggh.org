TBH I doubt much will happen of it. First you need a fic of sufficient popularity and quality to turn into a short movie. Then you need funding or a bunch of people that don't mind working for free. Thirdly, you need someone with great editing skills.

There are technical limitations as well. The more CGI you use the higher the computing needs go.
