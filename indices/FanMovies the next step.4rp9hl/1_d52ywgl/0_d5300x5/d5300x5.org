Agreed - I have very demanding tastes and of all the short HP fan vids I've seen (including the homemade music videos), the one I linked is the only one that meets my expectations. For me, it's a combination of the acting and camera quality - it needs that studio feature look to it.

I think the biggest problem we'd face is getting the funding...Especially if the Fanfiction we were adapting revolved around a ship that not everyone loved.
