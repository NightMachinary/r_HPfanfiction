I've wanted this for a long time, and I think someday we'll get there, but the reality is it's incredibly difficult, expensive, and time-consuming to make even a short film that's worth watching. The people who made that video did a kickstarter and they also made the Greater Good video in 2013. That's less than an hour of content in four years.

(also, had no idea the Severus Snape one was out, so thanks for the reminder to watch it!!)
