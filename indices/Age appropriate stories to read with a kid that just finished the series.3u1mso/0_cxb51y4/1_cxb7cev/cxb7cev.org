Thanks for the suggestions. I'm looking at my list of favorites and some other lists and almost every one is either too mature, as in how do you explain to a child that Dumbledore might not be the good guy, or something like Make a Wish where they couldn't possibly be old enough to understand the historical or literature background enough to enjoy it, and it would just be a waste of time to read huge portions of it, or too sexual, even if its subtle, or too gory. Next gen is definitely the way to go, but I really don't read much of it because I'm not generally not looking for stories suitable for a kid =/
