My son's first fanfiction, which he read back when he was nine and finished the series, was linkffn(The Best Seven Years by Blu Taiger), a Calvin and Hobbes crossover.

About this time, he and I conspired to co-write a short and very silly Star Wars crossover (the Omake linked [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/11/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][here]]; warning: the main bit of story, a sequel of sorts to "Sirius gives Harry The Talk," isn't age-appropriate.)
