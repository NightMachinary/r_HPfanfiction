Harry held the diary, said the ritual words, and at first, it seemed whatever was supposed to happen failed.

Harry didn't feel any different. There was no flash of light. He stood still in the dark, quiet Chamber, save for Ginny's soft sobbing and the ominous hissing off somewhere shadowed.

Then the scar burned.

/"Well, this is awkward,"/ said a cool teenager's voice in Harry's head.

"Ow!"

/"Oh, that damnable fool."/

"Hhggg!"

/"I can feel it too, you know."/

"Then make it stop!"

"Harry? Is that you? What's going on?" asked a small voice near Harry's feet, somewhere to his left.

"Nevermind -- ARGH!"

/"Oh, fine. Here, for both our sakes!"/ Like a tap opening, the blazing pain sort of siphoned away into a dull thrum in a matter of moments.

/"Occlumancy, naturally. You'll have to pick it up. And you can just/ think, /by the way. No need to announce yourself for my sake."/

"How?" Harry wondered, then caught himself. /"How?/" he thought, rather loudly.

/"Tom Marvolo Riddle. I am Lord Voldemort. I thought it clever at the time. Oh what a fool we were."/

Something touched Harry's foot, causing him to recoil and bring his wand about.

"Protego! Locomotor Mortis!" Harry incanted, immediately.

"Hmmmf, Harry!"

"Ginny?"

/"Good instincts, boy, if a bit touchy."/

"Ginny! I'm so sorry! Here." Harry undid the charm, then had the strangest sensation of déjà vu.

/"Starting to understand, are we?"/

"Ginny, I'm sorry."

"What for?" Harry could see her now, withered away, big brown eyes staring up at him, lost and pleading. "We're not supposed to be here. We're in danger."

"No, not anymore."

/"Oh, he's beginning to understand..."/

"Harry?"

"Ginny, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."

"Harry? What's wrong? What's going on?" Ginny pleaded.

"No one," Harry started, "is going to hurt us anymore."

And with a few breaths of Parseltongue, Harry heard the King of Serpents beckon.

/"Yes. Now you understand, don't you?"/

"I'm afraid," Harry continued, "that I've found myself. All ourselves. It is going to be very difficult, Ginevra."

"What? What's going to happen, Harry?"

"Everything."
