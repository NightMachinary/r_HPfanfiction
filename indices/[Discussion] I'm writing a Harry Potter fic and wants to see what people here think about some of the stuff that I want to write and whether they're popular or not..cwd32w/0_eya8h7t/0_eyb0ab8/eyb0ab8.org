Yeah... it sounds like a completely generic indy!Harry bashing fic from 2008, with incredibly minor variations - "Yes, Harry will inherit multiple lordships, but my Harry will have 2% less wealth".

The only distinguishing feature is having another villain more powerful than Voldemort... which does not seem like a good idea. Power inflation = meh.
