From what you've described on this tread, I feel like you're trying hard to inform us that this will not be like the others lord Harry fics, but I don't actually see what's making it significantly different, if at all. If you want to write OP Lord Potter with a harem fighting against manipulative Dumbledore and meanies Weasleys you can do so and you don't need to justify yourself.
