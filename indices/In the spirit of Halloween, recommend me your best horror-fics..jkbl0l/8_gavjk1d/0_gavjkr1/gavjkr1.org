#+begin_quote
  Draco Malfoy is convinced that his mother has been murdered, not committed suicide, the way the Aurors have decided. He demands that Harry Potter, disgraced Auror, help him investigate to prove it and catch her killer. But the longer Harry and Draco investigate Malfoy Manor, the more Harry becomes uneasily aware that there is something strange about the stories Draco is telling him---and the little room that's always kept locked.
