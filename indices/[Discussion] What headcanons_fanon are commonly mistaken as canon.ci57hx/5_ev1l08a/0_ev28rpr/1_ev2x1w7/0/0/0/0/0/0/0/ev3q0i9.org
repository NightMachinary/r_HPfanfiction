Yep! I hate that trope. Whenever a fic just has him as a dentist, I'll favorite it.

I can see the combination as a side-effect of the mental strain, rather than Harry starts breathing heavily from excessive uses of magic.

To keep up reflexes and a minor amount of movement, exercise is fine. To make it seem like Harry is unique or something, that's just stupid.

Prince of Slytherin has quite a few interesting elements, but the whole Wrong Boy Who Lived Genre with alive parents just seems wrong, as does a good Lucius Malfoy.
