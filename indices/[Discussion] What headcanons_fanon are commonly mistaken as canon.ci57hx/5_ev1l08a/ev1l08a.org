The Tempus spell, but I haven't seen that one much.

Magical exhaustion, getting tired from doing magic, but not being tired from the action of waving your hand or something like that.

A magical core that is what allows wizards and witches to use magic, and that squibs just have small cores.

There's a way to remove the Horcrux from Harry's head without killing im, this is murky, because for all we know, there's a ritual to purge a soul from something, alouth this would be safer for another Horcrux, but would have a higher risk of purging both souls.

Also, the Weasly's already being in the Order of the Phoenix, I've seen this one in some fanfics, not sure if this is a popular mistake.
