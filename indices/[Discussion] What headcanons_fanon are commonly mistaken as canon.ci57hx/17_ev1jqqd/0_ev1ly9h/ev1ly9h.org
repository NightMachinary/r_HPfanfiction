Technically, it /was/ stated in canon, just with a corollary.

What she /wasn't/ called was ''Brightest witch of *the* age' - which implies that she is the most intelligent witch in a specific period of time. That's the one I've seen which is definitely not canon.

What Lupin actually says is

#+begin_quote
  â€˜You're the cleverest witch of your age I've ever met, Hermione.'
#+end_quote

(Brightest is used in movie canon)
