I'm not. Dumbledore's theory is that if Harry willingly sacrifices himself, and Voldemort 'kills' him, Harry will survive the Avada Kedavra. But either way, Harry has to be hit with the killing curse. If Dumbledore is wrong, then Harry dies and the 7th horcrux is still destroyed.

There's no version of Dumbledore's plan that doesn't involve Harry standing in front of a killing curse.
