And we just fundamentally disagree. He was willing to risk Harry's life on an untested theory about how an unprecenteded intertwining of magic and souls would counteract an unblockable, otherwise infallible killing curse.

When he told Snape that Harry needed to be told he was a Horcrux, the only thing that *had to happen* was for Harry to be hit with a killing curse. That the rest of the pieces fell into place (Harry did so willingly, didn't fight back, Dumbledore's theory was correct, and Harry chose to go back from King's Cross instead of continuing "On") was all a bonus. It was a desired bonus, but it was not a necessary one. Dumbledore's plan would have been successful even if Harry was hit with the killing curse and killed outright.
