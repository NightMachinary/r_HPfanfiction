Yes, he is using Harry to end Voldemort. But he isn't grooming him to die. He isn't trying to sacrifice a child. The prophecy makes Voldemort feel threatened by Harry so for the rest of Harry's short life, he will be hunted by Voldemort. Dumbledore planned to manipulate Harry's death at the right moment, so it'll allow Voldemort to die, rather than dying in vain.

Yeah it's pretty messed up, but it's not like Dumbledore had a choice. It was either protect Harry until both of them eventually die by Voldemort's hand. Or use their deaths as a catalyst for Voldemort's mortality.

Still Dumbledore should've done things differently. But a character without flaws is a boring one.
