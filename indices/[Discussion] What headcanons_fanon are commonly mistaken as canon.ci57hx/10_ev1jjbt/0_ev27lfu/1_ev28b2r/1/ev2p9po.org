"Harry was going to die anyways..."

...unless someone tried to do something to specifically protect Harry from dying. Like, oh, I dunno, maybe not keep him in the exact same community where the "sadistic, insane Dark Lord" is guaranteed to come back and look for him? I mean, that's almost as bad as hiding a priceless artifact in a school full of kids, and then telling them to not go where said artifact is kept because it's dangerous. Who in the right mind would do something that dumb, right?

I find it impossible to believe that there was nothing that could at least be attempted - like send him abroad with a changed name and maybe some surgery to change his looks. It's not a guarantee, sure, but it's also not specifically grooming him to die. And if the prophecy is genuine, the eventual confrontation will happen regardless. And maybe Dumbledore is wrong that Harry has to die - he's not omniscient, is he?

The point is, Dumbledore leaned into the prophecy and accepted it in a way that led to grooming Harry to die, instead of actually trying hard to protect him, give him a good childhood, and find a way to help him avoid death. A bit like how Voldemort leaned into it and actually ended up marking someone. Had he ignored it, maybe he'd have been better off.
