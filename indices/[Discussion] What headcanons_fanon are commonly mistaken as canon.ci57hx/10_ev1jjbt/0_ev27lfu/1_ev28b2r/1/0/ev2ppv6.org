To hide would force Harry to live in fear constantly. To be worried all the time whether or not every new person he meets is a death eater. I don't know what kind of life that is, I would rather be dead.

Voldemort would eventually take over Europe because no one besides Harry can kill him. And then he would take over internationally. Eventually Harry would be found and killed.

His life of paranoia and fear would eventually end with death eventually.
