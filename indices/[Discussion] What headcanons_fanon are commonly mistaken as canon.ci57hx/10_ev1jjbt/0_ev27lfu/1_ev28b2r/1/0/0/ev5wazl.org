1. Who said he'd be hiding? With a new name and face in a new country, he could live a relatively normal life. Most of those who go into the Witness Protection Program don't live in constant fear. They are "hiding" from their old friends, but they aren't hiding from the people around them. They have houses, go to school, get jobs and do the things everyone else does. Harry, being raised in that situation, wouldn't know anything else and thus wouldn't make the sorts of mistakes that tend to out such people.
2. Much of what you describe is already a factor in canon - worrying about the people he meets. Except that in canon, he has a lot more cause to worry because he's living in an area which has the highest concentration of Death Eaters and Voldemort Supporters in the entire world. Getting away from that can't possibly be /more/ risky. Thus there's no need to think that every day would be burdened with paranoia and fear - certainly no more than he needs for his situation in canon, and probably quite a bit less.
3. For most of the time that Harry was growing up, the threat was Death Eaters, not Voldemort himself - and when it was Voldemort, it was always in the context of Hogwarts. It seems to be that someplace other than Britain and Hogwarts would have produced a much lower degree of risk and far fewer deadly situations. For example, I doubt that Malfoy would have been able to release a Basilisk in a school in Bolivia. I don't even know if Malfoy would know where Bolivia is, much less have a way to learn that a white kid of the right age was going to school there.
4. There's nothing in canon that says that Voldemort wants to take over even all of Europe, much less the world. Sure, it's plausible - he's ambitious, after all, but it's not a certainty.
5. Although it's not certain, it seems plausible that someone other than Harry can "kill" Voldemort's new body just fine. That wouldn't end Voldemort entirely, but it would deprive him of a body and the means for effectively leading his Death Eaters for a while. It certainly wouldn't contradict the prophecy.
6. Just because Harry's the only one who can kill him doesn't mean that every one of Voldemort's plans will be a success. He can be prevented from conquering Europe /and/ not be killed. He can just, you know, not win. So long as he leaves the battlefield alive (without or without a body!), the prophecy hasn't been violated.

I never suggested that there are ways to keep Harry /perfectly/ safe. We can probably assume that that's not possible. Therefore, moving to another country and living under a different name will still come with some risks for him. The question is rather what's /more/ safe (and what's more conducive to a happy childhood). I suggested a means for accomplishing that - and one that wouldn't even require too much magic. I'm sure there are others.

Dumbledore didn't do anything like that. There's no indication that he even tried - and given his position with the ICW, he definitely had the means and contacts. Instead, he kept doing things that kept pushing Harry and Voldemort together. Snape was an irredeemable ass, but I think his conclusion about how Harry was raised was more accurate than not.

Note that Dumbledore didn't utter even a word of disagreement when Snape said that. In other situations, Dumbledore definitely did dispute Snape's comments, including where Harry was concerned.
