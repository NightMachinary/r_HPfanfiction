He didn't groom a kid to die. Harry was going to die anyways because a sadistic, insane Dark Lord was trying to murder him every chance he got.

The mistake Dumbledore was keeping all the information to himself. He assumed that Harry dying was the only way to defeat Voldemort. It might be true or maybe there was another way around it. Maybe if other people had the info, they could've found something.

Either way, Dumbledore, after a century witnessing 2 dark lords kill his friends and family, is clearly tired and mistake prone. I don't like Dumbledore very much, but I do understand his reasons.

People also argue that Dumbledore planned all that blood/love sacrifice thing, but I don't believe it. TBH he was praying and winging it in the general direction.
