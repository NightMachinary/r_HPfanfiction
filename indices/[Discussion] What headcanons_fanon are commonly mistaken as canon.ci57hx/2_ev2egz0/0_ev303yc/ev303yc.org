This one annoys me a lot. Isn't the whole point of fanfic to take an existing work and expand on it?

Using gred and forge so much takes a concept and does the opposite of that: it flanderises them and strips their ability to come up with more than one joke at a time. It's as bad as the lemon drop obsession.
