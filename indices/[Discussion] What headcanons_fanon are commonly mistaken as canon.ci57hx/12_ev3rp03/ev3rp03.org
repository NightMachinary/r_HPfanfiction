'The Black sisters where in Hogwarts with the Maruaders' always aggravates me; the same with messing up the the order of birth of the Black sisters. Bellatrix was born in 1950 for sure. Andromeda was born a couple years later. Narcissa was born a couple years after Andromeda. James and Sirius were born early 1960/ late 1959.
