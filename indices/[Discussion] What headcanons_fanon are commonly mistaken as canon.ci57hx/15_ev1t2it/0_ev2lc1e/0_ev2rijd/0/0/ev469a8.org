  As a category of charms, I think it would have potential in a fic.

They're not just charms though. This is why I'm against the use of "wards" - not because the word isn't mentioned in canon, but because it results in people treating "property protection spells" as a unified body of magic.

But in the books property protection consists of a large variety of charms, curses, hexes, jinxes, creatures, and even transfiguration and potions. And more often than not, the way wizards protect property is not by preventing entry, but by allowing an intruder to enter but impeding them in some way after entry with e.g. magical traps.

The canon system is so much more interesting and varied than a magical bubble of protection with various "rules" coded into it like an algorithm, which is what most people mean when they say "wards".
