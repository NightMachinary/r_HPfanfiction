It's pretty hard to argue against you isn't it. You make valid points.

I'd argue the canon system of magic is primarily dominated by charms.

That being said, I get what you're saying. Magical defenses are more nuanced in canon, as seen with Voldemort's locket cave.

But I have nothing against the name for some of the general charm protections. Whatever they used on the hunt, sure. The fidelius, definitely. Making a building unplottable, good.

That being said, it's rarely done well.
