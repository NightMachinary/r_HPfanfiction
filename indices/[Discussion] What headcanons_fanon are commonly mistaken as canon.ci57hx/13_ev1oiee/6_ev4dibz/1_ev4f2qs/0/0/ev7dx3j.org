the evidence you gave shows that you have to want to see the person suffer, that is not even close to them requiring hate. Harry definitely hated Bellatrix but wasn't able to torture her because he lacked the sadistic perspective required, in Deathly Hallows he knows about this and manages. I dont see where you get hate as requirement from the quotes you gave.
