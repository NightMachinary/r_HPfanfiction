Since you added more things.

#+begin_quote
  1)Susan Bones being an orphan. While there is no direct evidence in the books for this it does mention her entire family being killed by death-eaters with absolutely no mention of her parents anywhere in the books but a fleshed out character for her aunt. At the very least it is something we can infer.
#+end_quote

No, it mention specifically the family of her uncle being killed by Death Eaters.

here

#+begin_quote
  There were relatives of their victims among the Hogwarts students, who now found themselves the unwilling objects of a gruesome sort of reflected fame as they walked the corridors: Susan Bones, who had an uncle, aunt, and cousins who had all died at the hands of one of the ten, said miserably during Herbology that she now had a good idea what it felt like to be Harry.
#+end_quote

If Susans parents died it surely would have been mentioned when Harry talked about their similar experience of loosing family.Not to mention that her parents not being mentioned doesent make being an Orphan Canon.

  2)The Marauders being pranksters.[mischief makers],([[https://www.pottermore.com/collection/who-were-the-marauders]]) while not explicitly pure pranksters they almost certainly did pull pranks, hell they had a secret map that tould them where everyone was and the password was "I solemnly swear I am up to no good."
#+end_quote

Being a rule breaker doesn't mean youre a prankster, everything we know about them shows them breaking lots of rules like being of of bounds, becoming animagi, or cursing other students, none of what we know points at them pulling pranks. If no Prank was ever mentioned, then them being pranksters isn't canon.

  3)The killing curse killing by removing the soul. While it is uncertain if it is an artifact of the horcruxes, Voldemort described the curse as ripping his soul from his body.
#+end_quote

He described dying as ripping the soul from his body, we already know that your soul doesn't stay in your body when you die, and we already know that removing the soul doesn't kill, thats one of two things dementors do. The killing curse killing by removing the soul isn't canon.

#+begin_quote
  4)Transfiguration is temporary. JK Rowling has actually weighed in on this an said conjuration is temporary.
#+end_quote

She said conjuration specifically is temporary, there is no canon evidence that transfiguration is temporary, we even know that wizards believe that transfiguration isn't temporary because Quintapeds are belived to be transfigured wizards(umcomfirmed but people believing it shows its possible). Unless you have any instance of a transfigration wearing off, or Rowling saying something about it, then Transfiguration being temporary isn't canon.

#+begin_quote
  5)The creation of Horcruxes affecting Voldemorts sanity. Professor Slughorn states that "it will split your soul", and Voldemort says "I was ripped from my body, I was less than spirit, less than the meanest ghost . . . but still, I was alive." Obviously this had an effect on his sanity.
#+end_quote

I feel like with this one you weren't even trying. Nothing in your quote shows how it affected his sanity.He became a wraith when he died, there is nothing suggesting that it affected his sanity, it was even mentioned that his mind was unaffected

#+begin_quote
  "Yes, I think so," said Dumbledore. "Without his Horcruxes, Voldemort

  will be a mortal man with a maimed and diminished soul. Never forget,

  though, that while his soul may be damaged be-yond repair, his brain and his

  magical powers remain intact. It will take uncommon skill and power to kill

  a wizard like Voldemort even without his Horcruxes."

  6)The Black family having a library. They are an old powerful family with a history of dark arts practitioners as well as a Hogwarts headmaster in recent memory, if not a library they had a lot of books.
#+end_quote

having a couple of books on blood purity isn't the fanon associated library of hidden forbidden magic, and those few books on blood purity are all we saw in canon. Unless any library is mentioned, it isn't canon. in fact nothing in canon suggest that there are even lots of privately owned books on dark magic.

#+begin_quote
  7)Vodlemort regularly tortures his followers. Well he crucio'ed peter for letting Crouch Sr excape in the goblet of fire and he crucio'ed another in the graveyard. He also commanded draco to crucio rowle. In Order of the Phoenix he is talking to a trembling rookwood, who acts like he was tortured. All in all he seems on board with using it on his followers as a disciplinary tool.
#+end_quote

There are three instances in canon where Voldemort tortures his followers over a period of about 3 years all for seirious fuck ups, that isn't the constant torture that fanon shows him to do pretty much every day.

#+begin_quote
  8)Magic breaking all technology. It is known to interfere with electricity to the point of them not working. It wasn't stated if magic was outright breaking them or just causing them to stop working.
#+end_quote

In Canon some technology doesn't work in environments with lots of magic, but it works fine with technology in general and as far as we know it doesn't break it. We know its even possible to use magic on technology without any problem, with Arthur Weasley even fixing an electric fire with magic. Unless you have any thing that suggest magic affects technology in general this isn't canon.
