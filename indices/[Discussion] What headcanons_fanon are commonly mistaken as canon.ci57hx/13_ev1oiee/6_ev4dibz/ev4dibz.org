I didn't read all of them, but this is not a perfect list. Unforgivables do require hate as said by Bellatrix 'You need to mean them, Potter! You need to really want to cause pain --- to enjoy it --- righteous anger won't hurt me for long --- I'll show you how it is done, shall I?' with Snape saying 'you haven't the ability or the nerve' to Harry when he attempted to use it again. It is actually fairly well established in cannon that the more sadistic and hateful, the more powerful the cruciatus.

In the case of the killing curse we have Barty Crouch Jr say 'The Killing Curse is a curse that needs a powerful bit of magic behind it --- you could all get your wands out and point them at me and say the words, and I doubt I'd get so much as a nosebleed.' and it is the killing curse so you must want to kill someone.

In the case of the Imperius curse, we have no evidence of needing to be really anything to use it properly.

Here is a list of the dubious ones I see on your list that I haven't bothered to grab citations for (I am editing in cites as I go along):

1)Susan Bones being an orphan. While there is no direct evidence in the books for this it does mention her entire family being killed by death-eaters with absolutely no mention of her parents anywhere in the books but a fleshed out character for her aunt. At the very least it is something we can infer.

2)The Marauders being pranksters.[mischief makers],([[https://www.pottermore.com/collection/who-were-the-marauders]]) while not explicitly pure pranksters they almost certainly did pull pranks, hell they had a secret map that tould them where everyone was and the password was "I solemnly swear I am up to no good."

3)The killing curse killing by removing the soul. While it is uncertain if it is an artifact of the horcruxes, Voldemort described the curse as ripping his soul from his body.

4)Transfiguration is temporary. JK Rowling has actually weighed in on this an said conjuration is temporary.

5)The creation of Horcruxes affecting Voldemorts sanity. Professor Slughorn states that "it will split your soul", and Voldemort says "I was ripped from my body, I was less than spirit, less than the meanest ghost . . . but still, I was alive." Obviously this had an effect on his sanity.

6)The Black family having a library. They are an old powerful family with a history of dark arts practitioners as well as a Hogwarts headmaster in recent memory, if not a library they had a lot of books.

7)Vodlemort regularly tortures his followers. Well he crucio'ed peter for letting Crouch Sr excape in the goblet of fire and he crucio'ed another in the graveyard. He also commanded draco to crucio rowle. In Order of the Phoenix he is talking to a trembling rookwood, who acts like he was tortured. All in all he seems on board with using it on his followers as a disciplinary tool.

8)Magic breaking all technology. It is known to interfere with electricity to the point of them not working. It wasn't stated if magic was outright breaking them or just causing them to stop working.
