Time Turners can change the past that you don't know for sure happened. Like Harry couldn't have saved Buckbeak if he had seen it getting killed but he didn't. He heard something and assumed he was killed. He maybe could have replaced it if he had seen its death because it didn't affect him directly but if he was to lose an arm I don't think he could change that because he's certain that he lost his arm.

Harry surviving the AK because of two souls is partially true. It's that and the fact that Voldemort had taken his blood and thus Lily's protection.

Voldemort torturing his followers is seen multiple times (which is stupid but he does when he's displeased by them).

Voldemort being less of a threat than Grindelwald is never stated but Grindelwald was a Dark Lord opposed by multiple countries and Voldemort was mainly a threat to magical Britain so in a way he was less of a threat. The only "redeeming" thing is that he practically achieved sort of an immortality. Thing that Grindelwald didn't (yet because you never know with JKR retcon)
