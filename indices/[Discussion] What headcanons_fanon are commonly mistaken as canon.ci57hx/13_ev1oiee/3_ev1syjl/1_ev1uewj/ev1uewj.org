Everything you said shows that I have choosen the right things to include in a list of things people mistake as canon.

  Susan's whole family except Amelia was killed, it's canon
#+end_quote

No it definitely not, it was her Uncle and his family who were killed.

  Time Turners can change the past that you don't know for sure happened. Like Harry couldn't have saved Buckbeak if he had seen it getting killed but he didn't. He heard something and assumed he was killed. He maybe could have replaced it if he had seen its death because it didn't affect him directly but if he was to lose an arm I don't think he could change that because he's certain that he lost his arm.

No, Time Turners can change the past in general, Hermione even warns Harry that they have to actively avoid doing that so they dont accidentally kill themselves.

  Harry surviving the AK because of two souls is partially true. It's that and the fact that Voldemort had taken his blood and thus Lily's protection.
#+end_quote

No, Harry survived because of a number of things, The blood in Voldemorts veins containing Lilys magic, Voldemort using Harrys own wand to kill him, and Harry actively choosing to walk to his death knowing he would die. None of the reasons we know of include that Harry had 2 souls.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort being less of a threat than Grindelwald is never stated but Grindelwald was a Dark Lord opposed by multiple countries and Voldemort was mainly a threat to magical Britain so in a way he was less of a threat. The only "redeeming" thing is that he practically achieved sort of an immortality. Thing that Grindelwald didn't (yet because you never know with JKR retcon)
#+end_quote

Firstly, like I said before only Voldemort is ever called Dark Lord, secondly the books explicitly mention that in the book of the most dangerous dark wizards of all time Voldemort is number 1 and Grindelwald number 2.
