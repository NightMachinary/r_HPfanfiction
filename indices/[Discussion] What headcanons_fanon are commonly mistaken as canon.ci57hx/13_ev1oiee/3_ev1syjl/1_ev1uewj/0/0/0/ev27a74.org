Didn't know for the Pottermore article. I won't argue that she said it can be done.

But so this means that if one kills his father in the past and is then "un-born" who kills his father? If the father is also "un-born" to balance it well the son is even less here to "un-born" himself and his father. But ok let's say the time stream corrects itself with a vengeance, how people in the present know that someone was "un-born"? If they disappear because their parents never made them, well no one would remember them because they never existed in the first place so you couldn't say they're "un-born". Even written thing about them or their achievement would disappear. It would more likely break the time itself and the existence. Or impose a parallel reality on the first time stream? Said time stream wouldn't exist anymore so yeah, reality extinguishing event. But with no proof.

Ugh that's why time travel is a tricky thing to introduce in a story. Except "do-over" (like saving a game shall we say), parallel timestream and my assumed version of JKR time travel all the other bring to impossibilities and brain damage.
