  Time Turners being able to change the past one's own past wouldn't be logical because of the usual paradox problem.

No Time Travel in Harry Potter is able to change the past and cause Paradoxes, Hermione even specifically mentions that wizards have killed both their past and future selves, Rowling even mentioned on Pottermore how dangerous Time Travel is and that a witch accidently caused lots people to never be born one time.

This is what Hermione Says

  “Exactly! You wouldn't understand, you might even attack yourself! Don't you see? Professor McGonagall told me what awful things have happened when wizards have meddled with time... Loads of them ended up killing their past or future selves by mistake!”

and this is what Rowling said on Pottermore on her article about time turners.

  ‘All attempts to travel back further than a few hours have resulted in catastrophic harm to the witch or wizard involved. It was not realised for many years why time travellers over great distances never survived their journeys. All such experiments have been abandoned since 1899, when Eloise Mintumble became trapped, for a period of five days, in the year 1402. Now we understand that her body had aged five centuries in its return to the present and, irreparably damaged, she died in St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries shortly after we managed to retrieve her. What is more, her five days in the distant past caused great disturbance to the life paths of all those she met, changing the course of their lives so dramatically that no fewer than twenty-five of their descendants vanished in the present, having been “un-born”.
