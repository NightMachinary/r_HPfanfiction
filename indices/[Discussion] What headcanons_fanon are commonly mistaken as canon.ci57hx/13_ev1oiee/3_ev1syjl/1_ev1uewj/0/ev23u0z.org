For Susan yeah I got mislead by the wiki.

Time Turners being able to change the past one's own past wouldn't be logical because of the usual paradox problem. If Harry lost his arms and went in the past to retrieve it he would maybe get it back but wouldn't have any reason to go back to save his arm thus losing it again so they may say so but that doesn't seem to work (Cursed Child notwithstanding but I consider it non-canon). With what Hermione says, if Harry killed himself in the past he wouldn't go back in the past to kill himself. She was more likely worried that he would kill his future self in the past. I think that's also why JKR made her time travel in the 3rd book as I described in my previous reply.
