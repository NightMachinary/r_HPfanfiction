The Marauders being pranksters

#+begin_quote
  “Precisely,” said Professor McGonagall. “Black and Potter. Ringleaders of their little gang. Both very bright, of course --- exceptionally bright, in fact --- but *I don't think we've ever had such a pair of troublemakers*---"

  “I dunno,” chuckled Hagrid. “*Fred and George Weasley could give 'em a run fer their money.*” ^{POA 10}

Dumbledore planning for Harry to die.

#+begin_quote
  “So the boy ... *the boy must die?*” asked Snape quite calmly.

  “And Voldemort himself must do it, Severus. *That is essential.*”

  [...]

  “We have protected him because it has been essential to teach him, to raise him, to let him try his strength,” said Dumbledore, his eyes still tight shut. [...] If I know him, he will have arranged matters so that *when he does set out to meet his death*, it will truly mean the end of Voldemort.”

  Dumbledore opened his eyes. Snape looked horrified.

  “*You have kept him alive so that he can die at the right moment?”*

  “Don't be shocked, Severus." ^{DH 33}

House elves needing to be enslaved

#+begin_quote
  “Oh no, sir, no,” said Dobby, looking suddenly serious. “ '*Tis part of the house-elf's enslavement*, sir. ^{GOF 21}

  “Kreacher is what he has been made by wizards, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “Yes, he is to be pitied. His existence has been as miserable as your friend Dobby's. He was forced to do Sirius's bidding, because *Sirius was the last of the family to which he was enslaved*, but he felt no true loyalty to him. ^{OOTP 37}

  “*The house-elf's highest law is his Master's bidding*,” intoned Kreacher. “Kreacher was told to come home, so Kreacher came home. ...” ^{DH 10}

Voldemort regularly tortures his followers

#+begin_quote
  He pressed his long white forefinger to the brand on Wormtail's arm. The scar on Harry's forehead seared with a sharp pain again, and *Wormtail let out a fresh howl*; Voldemort removed his fingers from Wormtail's mark, and Harry saw that it had turned jet black.

  [...]

  “Master!” he shrieked, “Master, forgive me! Forgive us all!”

  Voldemort began to laugh. He raised his wand.

  “ *Crucio* !” ^{GOF 33}

  He barely made it: Bolting the door behind him with trembling hands, he grasped his pounding head and fell to the floor, then in an explosion of agony, he felt the rage that did not belong to him possess his soul, saw a long room lit only by firelight, and the *great blond Death Eater on the floor, screaming and writhing*, and a slighter figure standing over him, wand outstretched, while Harry spoke in a high, cold, merciless voice.

  “More, Rowle, or shall we end it and feed you to Nagini? Lord Voldemort is not sure that he will forgive this time. ... You called me back for this, to tell me that Harry Potter has escaped again? *Draco, give Rowle another taste of our displeasure. ... Do it, or feel my wrath yourself!*” ^{DH 9}

  [...]

  As he did so, he gazed down at the tiny body, and his scar prickled and burned, and in one part of his mind, viewed as if from the wrong end of a long telescope, *he saw Voldemort punishing those they had left behind at Malfoy Manor.* ^{DH 24}

  [...]

  The Elder Wand slashed through the air and green light erupted through the room; the kneeling goblin rolled over, dead**; the watching wizards scattered before him, terrified**: Bellatrix and Lucius Malfoy threw others behind them in their race for the door, and *again and again his wand fell, and those who were left were slain, all of them*, for bringing him this news, for hearing about the golden cup--- ^{DH 27}

Harry being short

#+begin_quote
  Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but *Harry had always been small* and skinny for his age. ^{PS 2}
