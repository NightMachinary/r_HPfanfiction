Harry was against killing civilians, not against killing in general, in that same night he shot 3 death eaters of their brooms knowing it would kill them and even mentioning later, that as the reason why he disarmed Stan who was obviously under the imperius.

Later in the book he kills quite a few other Death Eaters and Voldemort and never bats and eye.
