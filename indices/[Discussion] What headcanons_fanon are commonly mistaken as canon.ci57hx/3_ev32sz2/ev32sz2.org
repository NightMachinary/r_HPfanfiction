That Lily dropped Severus because he called her a mudblood. That should be justification enough, but I often see fans argue that "it's just word under duress" and that she should forgive him for it... forgetting that in the HP world it's a racial slur. But in the flashback and with JK's add ons, it's clear she dropped him because this wasn't the first time he used the word mudblood, that he was hanging around death eaters, and experimenting with dark magic.

TLDR: It wasn't just the mudblood, it was the final straw in Snape doing increasingly shitty things that made Lily drop him.
