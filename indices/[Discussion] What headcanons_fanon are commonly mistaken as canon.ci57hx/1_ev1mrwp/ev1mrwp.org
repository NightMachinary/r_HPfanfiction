Notice-me-not charm

Warming charm (though there is a drying charm that shoots hot air at the target, this isn't the same thing as my-negligee-is-good-to-negative-ten-degrees)

'Point me' only points North, like a compass

Tracking charms

Wards that work like logic traps

Pepper-up potion doesn't act like an upper; it's a cure for the symptoms of the common cold. For magical ritalin/B complex/caffeine, see Wide-eye potion, though that was introduced in Pottermore for the online potion-making game. What's more, fanon assumes that wizards don't get sick, when they regularly do. They just have a bunch of cures they don't share with muggles.
