Welp guys I was completely wrong! It isn't even a Harry Potter Fanfic or the Universe! It's a Diviner, Analyst, or Seer from Sufficiently Advanced Magic (Arcane Ascension Book 1) by: Andrew Rowe. I read so much HP FanFics, WebNovels, Translated Chinese Novels & Manga and then regular old Fantasy n SciFi novels! Sometimes I just get them all mixed up! But I found it and it's awesome! Thank you guys for helping though I'm Reread dodging soon and going to check out the other recs!
