Oh gosh I have tons :) More so with Lily and Hugo because I prefer to write about them more than Rose/Albus/Scorpius.

- Lily Luna Potter - She takes after Ginny in appearance, short, red-haired, brown eyes and lots of freckles. She had the choice between Gryffindor/Slytherin and chose Gryffindor, although that was more because a couple of her friends were sorted there before her. She loves Quidditch, where she plays Keeper and eventually becomes Captain. She's cheeky and more than a bit reckless.

- Hugo Arthur Weasley - He's that bored genius child who isn't challenged in school and devotes his time and energy into getting into mischief. He manages to get by with good grades with minimal work, frustrating Hermione to no ends because she knows he's wasting his potential. I see him being a combination of Hermione and Ron in terms of looks. He's tall, blue-eyed and red-headed, his hair is very curly. He hates flying and loves wizarding rock. Thinks himself witty, although he can be offensive at times.

- Colin Thomas Longbottom - an OC, but he's in my next-gen Headcanon so it felt wrong not to include him. He's the eldest Longbottom child and has a brother and two fraternal twin sisters. He's the quieter and more responsible member of the Lily/Hugo/Colin dynamic. He's easily embarrassed, especially by his 'dorky' father who teaches at Hogwarts. Not the greatest at communication, especially when it comes to girls. He's outdoorsy and likes Herbology and Care of Magical Creatures, along with actives like hiking, swimming, camping.

- James Sirius Potter - James is more a blend of both parents. He's got messy, reddish-brown hair. Sorted into Gryffindor. He's the wild child and there were a few rough years n his late teens / early twenties where Harry and Ginny didn't approve of his choices or friends.

I tend to stay away from Rose/Scorpius/Albus just because they're written a lot and people have pretty firm views on them. I tend to think they're not that close. Rose is a Ravenclaw and has her own friends. Albus and Scorpius are Slytherins and roommates, but not best friends.
