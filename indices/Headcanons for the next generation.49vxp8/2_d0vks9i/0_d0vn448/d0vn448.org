Same about the main characters' kids! I really veer away from stories where they're a trio or they're the primary focus. I feel like fanon makes the Potter-Weasleys... sickeningly functional? Like everyone gets along with each other and are perfect easy-going kids. I like it when family is awkward or just plain doesn't get along, or maybe they don't even know each other all that well. For me, Rose/Scorpius/Albus are split into Ravenclaw/Slytherin/Hufflepuff and annoy the heck out of each other.
