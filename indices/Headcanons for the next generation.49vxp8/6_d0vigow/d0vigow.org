The Potters, the Malfoys, the Weasleys and the Parkinsons reconcile over shared drinks following a rather nasty dispute between both sets of Quidditch fanatics.

Pansy Parkinson and Harry Potter faced off against Draco Malfoy and Ron Weasley in an impromptu hexing brawl that set Chudley Stadium on fire, After the arrests, trial and subsequent acquittal of all parties involved in exchange for footing the repair & therapy bills, both Gryffindors and Slytherins started a political alliance that would live on in infamy-thanks, in large part, to the number of screaming matches the allies engaged in when they thought nobody was nearby.
