I could talk endlessly about mine and... I accidentally just did:

- Fred Weasley II became one of my my favorite next gen characters after spending two years of being the most frustrating PoV to write. I write him as a straight-laced adrenaline junkie--the stuffy but incredibly competent point man for your Hogwarts heists. Self-conscious about his coolness and comes off as a dork because he's surrounded by his family at school who totally know better. Wishes he were more than a sidekick but is only held back by himself.
- Albus is a simultaneously naive and wise Hufflepuff (I might just love contradictions in my characterizations). If there were a Captain Planet/HP crossover, he'd be the Heart. Steadfast in his beliefs even if they sound super cheesy to everyone else. Can literally talk to Quidditch equipment. Trains under Charlie to become a dragon keeper.
- Rose, for some reason, I think of her as a screaming harpy that doesn't chill until her twenties. Carries a lot of imagined pressure around.
- Lucy is an Slytherpuff art student. My friend writes [[http://hpedit.tumblr.com/post/107542892621/in-the-opinion-of-most-a-slytherin-hufflepuff][my fav version of her]].
- Scorpius is a budding entrepreneur, because one version of my Draco became a businessman postwar. He's kind of lame and has terrible fashion sense because he's rich and he can. He earnestly Believes In People but is an asshole about it, because he wasn't socialized very well (he was largely raised by his favorite house elf). Loves his father but they don't see eye to eye at all about the future of the wizarding world. [[http://hpedit.tumblr.com/post/124683392090/part-i-the-dreaming-cynic-part-ii-the-cynical][A dreaming cynic]] (ah, the contradictions again).
- Might as well introduce [[http://hpedit.tumblr.com/tagged/beatrice-chang][Beatrice]]: Cho married a muggle after the war, and I imagine him as a science researcher who left her after the pressure to keep the magical world secret became too much for him. One of their daughters Bea has an interest in her father's field and magic at a young age and probably a genius IQ. Grows up to be an eccentric inventor who tries to find ways to get the Wizarding World up to speed with the Muggle world. Nearly breaks Hogwarts.

I write a few next gens, but these are all from a story of mine that I consider my "headcanon" next gen.
