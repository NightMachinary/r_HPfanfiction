-James Sirius best friends with his cousin Fred II and become the greatest Hogwarts pranksters since Fred and George. Both in Gryffindor. James end up being Gryffindor's Seeker. Prejudice of Slytherin despite what his father has taught him (has trouble accepting his baby sister being sorted Slytherin.

-Albus becomes best friend with Scorpius (their fathers would love that (; ) Either Gryffindor or Slytherin as long as they end up friends. Plays Chaser on his House team. Struggles with having such a strong resemblance to his father, doesn't like all the attention he gets.

-Scorpius being nothing like his father (besides in looks) was when he was in school. Maybe a tad prejudice against Gryffindor's just because of how some of them treat him due to his families mistakes regarding the War. Again best friends with Albus. I imagine him and Lily Luna eventually falling for each other (repeat of falling for the best friends little sister) I think it would be cute. His father isn't exactly pleased about their relationship at first but comes around quicker than expected, his mother loves Lily.

-Very ambitious, as the youngest Lily Luna wants to stand out from her family (who are primarily in Gryffindor) she ends up in Slytherin and is happy about it, except James has trouble accepting her as a Slytherin. A bit rebellious. Ends up being a star Quidditch player (Seeker) gets on the team her first year. Brilliant at potions. Ends up with Scorpius. (Some of her extended family has trouble accepting that though)

-Rose is a daddy's girl but just like her mother when it comes to school. Not a big fan of Scorpius because of all the things Ron's told her about his family (Ron never could let his hatred for Draco go, Harry did although they'll never be best friends) Rose used to be closest with her cousin Albus but when he and Scorpius became such good friends they drifted apart.

-Hugo is just like Ron, feels like he's not good at anything compared to all his cousins. Him and Lily are best friends. ( I don't really have much for Hugo)

-Don't really have anything for the other cousins Sorry this was so long
