You're not the only one who doesn't think about Hugo. I forget he exists sometimes. I thinks it's the epilogue. We learn something about all the trio's kids except for Hugo. Rose has her mother's brains. James is the dramatic one who likes a laugh. Albus is quiet and insecure about his future. Lily clutched Harry's arm and cried about Hogwarts, mirroring Ginny in PS. Scorpius has the distinction of being the only Malfoy kid.

But Hugo? All we know is that he talks to Lily and they both laugh at Ron's jokes.
