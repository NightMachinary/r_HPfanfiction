-Rose is just as smart as Hermione but has the humor and reckless side of Ron

-Albus has middle child syndrome and feels like he doesn't quite fit in with his large extended family

-James is the "cool kid" and plays up who his dad is instead of getting embarrassed by it like Albus

-Lily is just as fierce as her mother once she gets to hogwarts, and also has a mischievous streak
