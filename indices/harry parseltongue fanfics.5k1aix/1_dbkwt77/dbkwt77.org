There is a lot of parseltongue in [[http://keiramarcos.com/fan-fiction/harry-potter/harry-potter-the-soulmate-bond/][Harry Potter and the Soulmate Bond]] (site requires signup to view fics). Not just Harry, he has a whole conclave of parselmouths. And at least 6 pets/familiars. It's complete, and 386k words.

I've heard at least one report that signups aren't going through, pm me if you'd like an ebook.
