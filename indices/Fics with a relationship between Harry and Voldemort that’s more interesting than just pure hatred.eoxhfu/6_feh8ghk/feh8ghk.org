Well, Limpieza de Sangre has already been recommended (which is absolutely amazing), so I'll fall back on some of my other recommendations.

linkao3(3136634) /grandloves/ is a fem!Harry/Voldemort fic. He realises that Harry is his horcrux in the graveyard, and takes her under his wing.

!linkao3(12983913) /Triple Trouble/ is a fic where a Dark Lord Harry from the future travels back in time, bringing the killed Voldemort and Grindelwald with him. All three are attending Hogwarts together, and Tom hates how friendly Harry keeps trying to be with him. It's hilarious.

linkffn(11358664) /Warning Signs Read Desolation/ is an abandoned but very good mentor!Voldemort fic.

linkffn(12492170) /Devil Take the Hindmost/ is another abandoned fic. Harry was able to mentally communicate with Voldemort from the moment that their connection was formed, so she's very affected by him. She even helps him get his body back far earlier than in canon and considers him to be her best friend. the fic technically pairs them, but it never got to that point in the story before it was abandoned.
