linkffn(12021325). Antithesis is kinda like this. Harry (or Adrian) has a really difficult relationship with Voldemort. He is adopted by Voldemort, and is “raised” by Bellatrix and other death eaters. He has a really fucked up childhood and is pretty unstable (mentally). He's incredibly conflicted about Voldemort and tried really hard to impress him. It's such an incredible fic, definitely one of my favorites. Linkao3(32915175) Ouroboros has Voldemort kinda protecting Harry from a young age and he becomes sort of a father figure. If you're ok with Tomarry, EclipseWing (on AO3) writes incredible fics. They always have such interesting relationships. Linkao3(15873207) has Harry suffering from Stockholm syndrome after being kidnapped by Riddle. Linkao3(17541269) Has a really cool premise where many wizard have been reborn/reincarnated as mutants (similar to x-men). Harry and Tom escape from a mutant rehabilitation facility together. Sounds strange but it's really good.
