Potions are created from substances that have concepts imbued into them. Magical substances hold more "concept" than non-magical substances.

They are added together and a witch or wizards magic binds them into a finalized form. This is why a muggle cannot brew a potion.

This also means that not only do you need good form to make a potion, you need the correct mindset for your magic to bind it properly. Mechanical perfection can still produce a ruined potion if the brewers magic is binding it incorrectly.

Magic itself is about intent and visualization. Neville fails because he believes he will fail.
