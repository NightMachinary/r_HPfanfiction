I like what Steelbadger did in /The Shadow of Angmar/, but I think I like HPMOR's view of potions better. Potions use the energy of the magical ingredients that go into the mix - which can make them very powerful and dangerous at the same time. Young students can't cast powerful spells yet because they still need to grow into their magic more, but they /can/ brew powerful potions if they're talented/smart enough to do so (ala Hermione and Polyjuice) because the magic comes from the ingredients.

Thus, when something goes wrong, it can go very wrong.

Potions are powerful and dangerous things.
