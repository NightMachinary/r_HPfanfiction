I always liked the idea of potions being chemistry+magic. Just like with chemistry, you can really fuck up in certain concotions. But instead of elements and molecules that have very exact functions, we use toadsfoot and pinecones. Why do pinecones add a naturey component? Because magic. How exactly does putting some soot into this potion give it heat-resistant properties? Because magic.

Something that takes a real master to truly excell at. There isn't a single way to make a wart-removal potion: there are as many ways as you can figure them out. The only limit you have is that of your knowledge and imagination. Snape may teach one way to make a potion, but he could make a few completely unique ways to get the same result.
