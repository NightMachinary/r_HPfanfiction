I have the view (influenced by multiple stories) that potions are essentially stationary spell matrices created by the potion master and held in place by the ingredients. It would also explain why Neville was so bad at making them, as he was never that great at spell work in the beginning. Also, from HPMOR, the amount of power present in a potion directly corresponds to the amount of energy required to make the ingredients. That would explain why certain potions require inane ingredients, like the toenail of a 100 year old Crumpled Horned Snorkack.
