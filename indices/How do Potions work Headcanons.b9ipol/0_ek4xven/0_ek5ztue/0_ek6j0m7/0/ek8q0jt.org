Not just Snape, even McGonagoll and Flitwick are barely adequate. They might be geniuses in their fields, but their way of teaching is so...bland and old fashioned. Wand movement, incantation and monotonous practice. And rote memorisation of them. Nothing so exceptional.

Hagrid would be an awesome teacher, if his sense of danger wasn't addled.

Lupin is clearly the best. Case closed. He might not be experienced as McGonagall or Flitwick, or Genius like Snape, but he actually knows how to teach! His way of teaching, way of conducting obstacle course as exam, they are so ingenious!

And ironically Barty Jr. was one of the best teachers.
