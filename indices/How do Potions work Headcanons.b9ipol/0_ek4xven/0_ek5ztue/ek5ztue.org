I have same view too. Potions are just like chemistry except with magical elements added to them. Neville doesn't do well because he is too nervous. Ron doesn't do well because he just tries to blindly follow the instructions without knowing the principles behind them. Hermione does well because...well she's Hermione.

Anyways, it's more of Snape's fault that he is a crappy teacher, even though he is genius at potions. I mean, /"Instructions are on the board, the ingredients are in cupboard, now brew the potion"/ isn't exactly what you call proper teaching.

That doesn't sound like a teaching of a potions master. That sounds like a teaching of an overworked, underpaid, mediocre teaching intern. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

If I were Snape, I would never let them touch any ingredients or brew potions until after three months, when they know sufficient theory and precautions
