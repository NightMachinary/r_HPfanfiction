I always assumed nevilles potions were volatile because he got too nervous to follow directions correctly. if potions is similar to real life chemistry, you can really fuck shit up if you mix stuff that you shouldn't be mixing. i mean even in middle school we had those shower things (though no one used them)

i assume potions work because chemistry and biology are a thing and then with magic you have extra powerful drugs pretty much that can do magical stuff like transfigure yourself. i believe a wit sharpening potion is mentioned in book 4 and that's kinda similar to say aderall or ritalin. and the pepperup potion could be similar to like 5 hour energy or something. A calming draught potion would be like xanax.
