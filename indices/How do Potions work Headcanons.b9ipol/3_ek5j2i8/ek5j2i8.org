So I love this quote; Cooking is an art and Baking a science. That like cooking fresher ingredients are better, depending when you add spice has a different effect depending on when you add them. Also weather you dice or slice also has an effect, things cooking faster or slower depending on its size. Some things cook faster than others like peppers compared to carrots and there flavours change depending on how you cook them, Take Potateos for example, you can fry them, roast them, steam them or boil them and they taste different each time.

So I think potions is like cooking except with magic, there is no foolish wand waving because the stirrer or spoon to stir the potion acts as a weak conduit infusing the potion slowly and consistently with magic. Different stirring techniques are necessary depending like in baking you can beat something in like eggs or fold im slowly to keep in air or whisk to combine and airinate ingredients. I think that the anti clockwise stirring is to reverse or slow down the process because we are working with magic so ingredients may be more of a catalyst than others therefore the need to slow down the reaction time. The baking part comes with the timing and exact ingredients. When making cake or cookies you can be lax with measurements but for meringue, mousse, cheese cake you must be more specific or your cake falls, your meringue is a mess and your cheese cake tastes weird. So I think you have to be very specific with potions, subtle with adding things, Neville is to nervous so he may add things to quickly not adding things gradually, where Harry and Ron lack precision. Hermione does well because she studys but also because she seems like someone who would be exact. Ingredients play a vital role aswell as magic. Fresher the better or depending when they are picked, like wolfsbane ingredients would be picked near a new moon because the werewolf is less active/weak that time of month instead of a full moon. Healing potions would have perhaps honey or ginger for their healing property's added at the end because magic is about intent so aswell as magical ingredients muggle ones can be used depending on their association or superstition surrounding them because magic is weird and doesnt always make sense. Cauldron's would also make a big difference, silver for sleep potions because silver is associated with the moon and night, pepper up in gold for daylight, but can be made in pewter. The difference would be like buying a microwave meal insted of going out to a restaurant or homecooked meal. Like it jist takes practice, a chef takes years to master their skill, and not in every area like a pastry chef of bakers ect. I think potions is like that as well a potioneer could be a specialist in healing potions, another in pastes, bodily enhancements, curing curses, defensive potions ect.

I didnt realise how much I thought about this untill I started writing so I hope this helps.
