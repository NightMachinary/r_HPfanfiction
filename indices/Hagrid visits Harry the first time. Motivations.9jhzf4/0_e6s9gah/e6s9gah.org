It was nice that it was Hagrid that showed up to give Harry his letter. Im not sure Mcgonagall, of Flitwick would of knocked a door down, bent Vernon's shotgun, and given Dudley Lardass a pig tail for the way they treated him. To think, if Hagrid hadn't picked Harry up, he likely would of never met Hedwig. I think Hagrid's motivations were to James and Lily, and he would of been deeply disturbed to find out how the Durleys treated Harry when he was growing up.
