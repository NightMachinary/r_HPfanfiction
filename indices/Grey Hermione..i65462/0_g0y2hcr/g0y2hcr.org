To me, an apathetic Hermione won't really be Hermione anymore. That said...

I don't know any fics that matches your description exactly, but there's a mediocre one-shot linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3615864]]) that matches some elements of the description.

Some decent fics that feature a Grey!Hermione:

- [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][/Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived/ by Diane Castle]]: Nonmagical AU in which Hogwarts is a school for superspies; everybody is pretty ruthless, though.
- /Dangerous/ by Black Lotus takes place a decade or so after canon and has Hermione leading a terrorist organisation against a backsliding Ministry. It went down with the original Granger Enchanted site, but there are copies of it floating around.
- linkao3(Making Their Own Heroes by slythernim) and sequels have Hermione trick her way into Durmstrang (It's a long story.) with many of the attendant consequences.
- linkffn(Remedial Lessons by SymphonySamurai), ruthless!Hermione.
- linkffn(For Lack of a Bezoar by BolshevikMuppet99), Harry and Hermione go on a Roaring Rampage of Revenge after Ron is killed.
- linkffn(Divided and Entwined by Starfox5) has Hermione leading a paramilitary group.
- linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology by jacobk) is still the best Slytherin!Hermione fic.
- linkffn(New Blood by artemisgirl) takes a bit too much fanon onboard, and I feel that prophecies about Hermione undermine her ethos, but it's still worth reading.
- linkffn(Hermione Granger, Demonologist by BrilliantLady): a fun read.
- linkffn(Purple Like Violets by Flye Autumne), an up-and-coming fic, though I don't know how much Hermione will be left by the end.
- linkffn(Requiem by Flye Autumne), a heavy AU.
- linkffn(Agent Double O Hex by KafkaExMachina): Harry is raised by James Bond; Hermione by recurring Bond villains. (A few episodes up.)
- linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution by Starfox5): Harry and Hermione go a bit Veil-crazy in their efforts to reform the wizarding Britain.
- linkffn(Spectrum by Consume): Hermione goes back in time to stop Riddle and, for once, doesn't get sidetracked. The problem is that she doesn't stop there.
