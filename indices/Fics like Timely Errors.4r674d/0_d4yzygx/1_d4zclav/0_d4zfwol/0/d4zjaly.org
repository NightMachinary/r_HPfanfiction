The "old English bit" is an attempt at using familiar (or informal) pronouns, yes, as English used to have before the formal became the sole mode and the informal was dropped. That's called the t-v-distinction in linguistics.

But it's also about wrong 2nd person conjugation. "Hath" is a 3rd person verb form, not second.

My native language still has them, and so I can't help but notice if they are used this persistently wrongly. It's supposed to signal times long past and authenticity, but it does the opposite.
