I haven't really found anything else like it. Most time travel fics it seems have the traveller staying there, and the whole story takes place in that time. However, linkffn(2814526) has Harry travelling back to the founder's time, for a relatively short amount of time, then going back. linffn(2690076) features Hermione and Fred travelling back for a year, then going back.
