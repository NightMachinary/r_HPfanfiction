I always thought it had to do with the fact they were learning it in the Room of Requirement.

So the Room not only enhanced harry abilty to teach but also the student abilty to learn.

If when harry called the room he specifically had in mind that he was going to teach the Patronus charm that day then that is what he Required, so that is what the room gave him.

I wonder what the Room of requirement would have given harry if he had thought to ask for a room were he could learn occlumency?
