  So the Room not only enhanced harry abilty to teach but also the student abilty to learn.

  If when harry called the room he specifically had in mind that he was going to teach the Patronus charm that day then that is what he Required, so that is what the room gave him.

  I wonder what the Room of requirement would have given harry if he had thought to ask for a room were he could learn occlumency?

So, I know this is a common fanon interpretation of the RoR, but as far as I know, there isn't good evidence that the room is super capable of handling esoteric requests, and it certainly doesn't give the /best/ option for whatever is requested. Asking for a "place to hide things" gives the same giant junk room every time, despite there being way better ways to hide things. Dumbledore gets a room filled with chamber pots when he needs the restroom, despite the castle actually containing modern plumbing.

Plus, it's better to assume that characters are reasonably competent and that there's a reason the world works as it is, and a learning enhancing room located in a /school/ going completely ignored and unused for a thousand years is a step too far IMO. I think it's much more likely that the RoR is just a kind of quirky room that can change its furnishings and there isn't a lot of value in a shapeshifting room when you have a castle filled with specialized rooms so it was forgotten over time.
