  Does the fact that Harry is able to effectively teach several members of of the DA how to cast corporeal patronae undervalue his own abilities and achievement or does it stand as a testament to Harry as a teacher?

1. It shows Harry's chops when it comes to teaching the understanding of how to face the Dark Arts, dark wizardry and dark creatures.

2. A bunch of 4th years up trying to learn it in a nice, comforting setting with all their friends is no where near as impressive as a 13 year old learning it by going face to goddamn face with dementors for months (all evidence shows that the boggart as dementor is indistinguishable from a dementor (EDIT: actually, the boggart!dementor would be weaker, forgot about that) as long as someone hasn't cast Riddiculous or whatever the charm is both spelled and actually called) on end, culminating with the successful casting during time travel shenanigans while driving off a veritable miasma of dementors.

3. We don't actually know how many people achieved a full-on corporeal Patronus. I just checked my copy of that chapter, and it says "The few Patronuses people had managed to conjure faded away into silver mist, leaving the room looking much darker than before." So, the only number we have for how many people were successful is "few." Now, as far as I'm aware, few is not an actual number, so we're going to need to ballpark it. We know it would be more than one, as few implies plural. It would therefore put two as the minimum. Which coincidentally is the number of people specifically stated to have a corporeal Patronus (Cho, Hermione) though Seamus had one very momentarily but could not hold it. So what would be the upper limit? The definition of few includes a component denoting that it refers to a small amount. So I would say the upper bound would probably be 5. So ~2-5 people actually successfully cast one. And I would argue that it is Hermione, Cho and one to three NEWT students based on how difficult we know the Patronus to be and how damn good Harry is at Defense Against the Dark Arts.

I blame the movie for people thinking that the Patronus isn't actually a difficult thing to do.

EDIT: Corrected some wording to properly state my points.
