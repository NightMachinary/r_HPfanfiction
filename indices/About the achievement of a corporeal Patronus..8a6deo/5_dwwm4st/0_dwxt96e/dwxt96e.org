The dementors are all on Azkaban and the patronus has no other use but to protect you from dementors and lenifolds (that live in the tropics).

(The ordinary citizen is not part of the 'Order of the Phoenix', so Dumbledore probably won't tell the public that patroni can deliver messages. That way there is a way for messages to be sent to people without suspicion.)
