I think a lot of it is a sign of how good a teacher Harry is. But it's also a sign of how bad Wizards are. It really can't be that hard of a spell, most of them are either too lazy to bother or too stupid to learn or teach properly.

I don't think it diminishes Harry's achievement. It's still hard and he's really young when he does it.
