There is also this to consider:

The Patronus is only designed to protect from Dementors.

The Ministry controls the Dementors.

The Ministry doesn't want anyone not on their payroll (like Aurors) to be able to fight the Dementors, because in their mindset, only they have control over the Dementors. But they can't make it illegal or they would be seen as deliberately setting up people to have their souls sucked out, so instead, they keep it off the curriculum. It's already a difficult spell, so it doesn't take much logic to figure that you would need a DADA NEWT in order to learn to cast it.
