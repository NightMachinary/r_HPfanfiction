  1 When Harry repelled a hundred Dementors at the end of PoA, he was casting from across a lake, at Dementors who were going after his time-clone, so he was casting on the "easy mode".

Don't forget the other explanation, that he gave at the end of PoA...he knew he could do it because he had already done it. Turns out this matters a lot in a spell that's based entirely on the mindset of the caster.
