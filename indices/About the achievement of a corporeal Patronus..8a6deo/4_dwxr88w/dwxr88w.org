I can't speak to Harry's pedagogical talents, but here are some thoughts about the Patronus:

1. Patronus is not a spell that requires a lot Patronus-specific of skill or practice: it took a 3rd-year Harry months to learn, whereas DA students, about 2-3 years older, learned the basic form in two weeks. That suggests that the general magic skills acquired in those years help.
2. Environment matters: casting in a comfortable setting among friends (e.g., DA), or even in a neutral setting (e.g., outside the Diner, or at the end of PoA^{1} ), is much easier than casting in the face of a Dementor, because Dementors suppress the very emotions needed to cast the Patronus (e.g., Harry's training, Hermione in the Ministry, battle of Hogwarts).
3. When casting in a difficult environment (i.e., in the face of a Dementor), the caster's emotional disposition and ability to persevere in the face of adversity are the decisive factors. Harry is brave and stubborn to the point of recklessness and wears his proverbial emotions on his sleeve, so he can push aside Dementor's depression and /just feel/. A more cerebral character (e.g., Hermione) falters, because how can one be happy in a world where money and blood matter more than truth, where slavery is commonplace, and where everybody leaves their homework to the last minute unless you nag them?
4. While [[/u/Jahoan]] brings up an interesting point about Ministry's incentives, I think that the main reason Patronus has a reputation as a rare spell is much more pedestrian than that: the Patronus Charm is utterly useless to the vast majority of the wizarding population. It's a very narrowly tailored spell only useful to those who either 1) interact with Dementors and Lethifolds in some capacity or 2) know Dumbledore's Patronus messenger trick. So, yes, it's not on the OWLs; that doesn't mean it's beyond OWLs, only that OWLs cover more useful spells.

^{1} When Harry repelled a hundred Dementors at the end of PoA, he was casting from across a lake, at Dementors who were going after his time-clone, so he was casting on the "easy mode".
