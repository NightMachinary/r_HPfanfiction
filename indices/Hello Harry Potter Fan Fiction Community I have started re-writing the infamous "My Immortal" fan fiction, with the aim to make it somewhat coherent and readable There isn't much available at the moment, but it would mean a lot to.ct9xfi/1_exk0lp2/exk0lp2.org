please let me know if i'm overstepping with the constructive criticism or anywhere else!

the voice you have for ebony is well done. it definitely feels similar to the author's voice in the original. it's sort of manic and rambly and self-conscious, like a real teenager starting a journal for the first time. it fits the epistolary format of the story you're doing, and it interprets the original story in a way that makes it make more sense.

on the flip side, the way it's written seems self-conscious and overly aware of what it's doing. it's pretty clear you set out with the goal of "fix my immortal," and i'd say you focus too much on fitting in all the details of the original story and making explanations to fit them in a more realistic setting. in an epistolary format like the one you're using, it can be difficult to "show don't tell," so it's understandable when the explanations feel kind of forced, but it's still a problem. this is closely linked with another element of your story so far; we're constantly reading an uninterrupted monologue, and especially with the kind of character ebony is it gets tiring/overwhelming.

if i were you, i would try to mix in other perspectives on the world of the story. maybe we switch back and forth to a more traditional format and follow ebony around throughout her days to get more of a grounding in time and reality. alternatively, maybe we read the journals/letters of her friends as well.

by the way, the journal format is a really good idea for conveying the sort of "biased" feeling of the original; the feeling that we're only seeing one (weird, twisted) view of the story and from a narrator who really wants to portray herself positively at all costs. i wouldn't have thought to make that format choice!

even if you don't continue or finish this, i'm glad you posted it! cause it's a pretty fun take on a fascinating artifact of fandom history, and it really got the gears turning in my head.
