This is the main issue I've encountered when writing this - how true do I stick to the source material? That was such a fundamental thing to decide for Ebony - do I keep her as irritating and narcissistic, or try to write her into a somewhat likable character? I decided to take the second route, so that anyone who decides to read it could root for her as a protagonist. That being said, I did try to make her rambly and somewhat flawed to capture some of the original traits of her character. I do understand where you're coming from though - does my explanation of how I've decided to write it make more sense?
