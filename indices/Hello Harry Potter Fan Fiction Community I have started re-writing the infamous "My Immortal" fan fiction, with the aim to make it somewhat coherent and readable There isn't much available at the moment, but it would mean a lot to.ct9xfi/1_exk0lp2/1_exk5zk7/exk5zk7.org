I agree with the journal format being the best device for description based upon Ebony's narcissism. My feedback is that she isn't narcissistic enough at all. Tara wrote this fic in a story narrative so it justifies opening with a thick description of Ebony. But Ebony presumably already knows who she is so the opening description can be littered throughout.

And it needs to be punchy and irreverent. She's a self obsessed teen and a Mary sue... Bold, rash and filled with hormones.

She might write:

October 11th

I fucking hate Lavendar Brown! That stupid prep was starring at me when Draco came up to me today. If she wasn't there with her band of preps, it would have made it perfect when Draco said hi to me in the perfect weather. It was raining and snowing! I'm such a goff, I love it when it rains and snows. It reminds me of the song lyric from Good Charlotte's (enter some lyric here I have no clue).

I fink Draco likes me. I looked really good today as I was wearing a black corset with matching lace around it, a black mini skirt (etc etc). I think lavender mucst be jealous of me because I'm a vampire and I have long black hair that reaches my mid-back and icy blue eyes like limpid tears.

And I'm a vampire!
