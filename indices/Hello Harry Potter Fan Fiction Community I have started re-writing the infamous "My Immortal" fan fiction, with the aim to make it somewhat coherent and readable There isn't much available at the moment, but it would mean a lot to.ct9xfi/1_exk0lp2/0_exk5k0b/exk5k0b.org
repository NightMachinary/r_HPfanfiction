Woah, thank you for the awesome reply! I don't think you can overstep with constructive criticism - and what you've given is great! I wasn't planning on telling the story through more traditional means, but now I definitely will, whem Ebony is finished introducing "her" world.

As an adpiring writer, the positive comments made me feel really good, so thank you for that too! :D
