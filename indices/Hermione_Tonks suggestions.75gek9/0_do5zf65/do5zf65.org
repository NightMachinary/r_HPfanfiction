First things first, I have toyed with the idea myself but found it difficult to write both in character and make their interactions believable. I see the main focus of the ship to be their differences and the way they complement each other. Tonks is an adult who had some problems growing up (her mother was cast out of the family and therefore no magical relatives were around, she was/is reduced to a sex doll and is a half-blooded daughter of a blood traitor). Hermione is a little too eager to grow up and prove herself better than the "Old Blood" expected of an "upstart mudblood". She is too serious and Tonks is not serious enough. Their mental ages meet somewhere in between and that opens the doors for a new perspective of the magical world. I always imagine Tonks living in both worlds, enjoying the comforts of both, magic and technology, apparating across the country to see Saxon or Iron Maiden or quickly hopping across the Channel for an evening out in the clubs of Paris. Also please avoid any long yearning for Remus or Ron and a slow-burn plot that takes three years to be resolved. The story would be better if the focus would be how Hermione and Tonks face threats together and not how many decades needed to pass in order for them to get together.

I think that an OotP setting would be best. At that point, their relationship has the potential to achieve a lot of changes to the overall plot without being completely unrealistic. Tonks arresting Umbridge would be pointless because the charges would never stick but Tonks being a solid foundation for Hermione and help her to shoulder some of the burdens of that year (OWLs, Umbridge, Voldemort, Harry being angsty) is a good starting point. Imagine Hermione sneaking out under Harry's cloak to meet with Tonks in the Shrieking Shack or pretending to spend a day studying while going on a date with Tonks, who takes her to Dublin, Manchester or some other place Hermione has never been. Paris, Brussel, Amsterdam, Frankfurt/Main and Cologne are closer to London than Inverness, therefore a magical would be able to apparate there easily. Because Tonks knows a thing or two about fighting (her mother was raised a Black and Moody helped things along even further) the DA takes a different route, possibly being smaller because Tonks understands that you and your friends are more important than a bunch of strangers.

The other option would be an HBP setting, possibly with their relationship starting at either a Hogsmeade weekend or at one of Slughorns parties (the man would certainly be interested in the metamorphic auror with House Black roots, who happens to be stationed in Hogsmeade). If you go with HBP I would advise against following the canon of the book and the escalation of the war because there are limited possibilities how an added Tonks could influence the events, especially if she is not with Harry (and we are going for Tonks/Hermione here). Avoid the "camping trip/Horcrux hunt" at all costs because there are smarter ways to get the job done (like renting a random flat somewhere in Norwich and putting it under the Fidelius or any other sane plan).
