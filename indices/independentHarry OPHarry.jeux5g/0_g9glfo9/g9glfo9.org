*The Election of 2000 (excerpt):*

â€‹

*/Wizengamot:/*

/Dear Mr. Potter/

/Your fellow Indies would like to know how you'll be voting/

*/Harry:/*

/It's quiet uptown.../

*/Wizengamot:/*

/Dear Mr. Potter/

/You know that Fugde won't stand a chance, so who are you promoting?/

*/Harry:/*

/It's quiet uptown.../

*/Wizengamot:/*

/Dumbledore or Riddle?/

/We know it's lose-lose/

/Dumbledore or Riddle?/

/But if you had to choose/

/Dear Mr. Potter/

/You know that Fugde won't stand a chance, so who are you promoting?/

*/Dumbledore and/* */McGonagall:/*

/It's a tie!/

/It's up to the Wizengamot!/

/It's up to Harry!/

*/Harry:/*

/Yo!/

/The people are asking to hear my voice/

/For Britain is facing a difficult choice/

/And if you were to ask me who I promote.../

/Dumbledore has my vote!/

/I have never agreed with Dumbledore once/

/We fought on like seventy-five different fronts/

/But when all is said and all is done/

/Dumbledore has beliefs, Riddle has none!/
