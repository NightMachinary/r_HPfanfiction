Harry/fem!Harry, because I like when Harry has someone who's been through terrible shit too and has also managed to get back up each time they get beat down. I greatly dislike pairings where the girl is just a pretty face who can't do shit. Part of why Ginny is good for Harry is because she's been beat down by Voldemort, too, and still stood tall afterward.

Also, incest.
