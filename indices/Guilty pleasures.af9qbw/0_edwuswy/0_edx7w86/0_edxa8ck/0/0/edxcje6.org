Yeah, I doubt that Bellatrix was planning trickshots. And Tonks also came out of duelling her knocked out and not mutilated or a vegetable, which adds credibility to that theory.

Then again, my headcanon is that Bellatrix and Andromeda kept getting along even after one of them became a Death Eater. Just imagine Tonks coming home after the Azkaban breakout only to find her mother and Bellatrix having tea.
