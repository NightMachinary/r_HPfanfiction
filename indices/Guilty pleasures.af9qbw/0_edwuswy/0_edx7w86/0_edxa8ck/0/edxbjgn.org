I find the idea of some Bellatrix/Sirius stuff interesting now that you bring him up. Always thought it was odd Bellatrix and him seemed to be toying with each other during their duel and not going after each other very hard and that Bella seemed to fire a shot of red light(stunning spell) at him instead of avada kadavra. maybe if he hadn't stepped in front of the arch and got knocked in he'd be okay. anywyay i find the idea that Bellatrix didn't full yhate him despite what she says to add excellent character depth to her and maybe his being a Black counted for something to her after all.... very very deep down.
