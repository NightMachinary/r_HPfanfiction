My guilty pleasures are multi ships (usually Snape/Harry/Draco, Harry/Draco/Lucius, or Hermione/Draco/Lucius) or a Lucius ship with Harry or Hermione. Even better if Snape and/or the Malfoys are still arrogant pricks (though not to Harry/Hermione).

I also don't mind a good super powered Harry or time travel fic (even better if you put the two together).
