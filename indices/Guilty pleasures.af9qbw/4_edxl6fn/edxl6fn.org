You almost have my preferred ships down perfectly. Including Harry/Bella as a guilty pleasure. I also try to read Harry/Tonks but sadly it's very rarely good. Especially stories during Hogwarts tend to come out lacking in that regard (only good one I read in that regard was a great Teddy time travel shortstory).

As for guilty pleasures I like Hermione/Fleur, Hermione/Bella, Hermione/Narcissa, Hermione/FemHarry. I'd also like Hermione/Daphne but can't remember ever encountering that pairing (besides harem/multi fics). At this point I'm not even sure if it's a guilty pleasure anymore to be honest.

I'd say harem fics are an occasional guilty pleasure, but they are often of dubious quality and more likely than not someone enters the pairing that I don't like.
