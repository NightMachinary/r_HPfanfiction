When it comes to pairings? Nah. I like what I like. I may enjoy certain pairings more than others or in a different way, but I don't consider any lesser or more indulgent.

The same cannot be said for fic. There's a very specific kind which I'd liken to a romance novel. Imminently readable, on the light side, and mixed with just the right tropes or characterizations. Given the proper mood, I'll eat those up with a spoon, regardless of any other flaws.
