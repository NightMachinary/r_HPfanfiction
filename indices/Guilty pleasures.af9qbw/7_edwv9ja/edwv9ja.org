Don´t judge me, okay?: I like Evil!Dumbledore, especially if the author does not absolve the Death Eaters of anything, if the fic simply adds a second Dark Lord into the fold.

The worst Dumbledore is, the better.

Everytime there is a " greater good Dumbles" I am reading it; I know, i know, but I like it...what can I do?

and yes, I am also down to Weasley bashing...other than Charlie and Bill, I enjoy fics bashing each and evyr Weasley for the most stupid and ridiculous reasons ( but I do not care about Potions Queen Molly and Potions Princess Ginny...)
