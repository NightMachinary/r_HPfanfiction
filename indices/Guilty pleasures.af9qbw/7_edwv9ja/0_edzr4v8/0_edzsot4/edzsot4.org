Crack - fic - the Goblet of fire gets pissed and "punishes" all the injust

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12053026/1/The-Goblet-s-Revenge]])

​

Vernon despises wizards, but instead of blaming Harry, he prepares him ( Dumbles is very stupid here and Harry is in love with Millie if I recall correctly)

​

Hermione is concerned about pimples and wants to cure skin cancer; the world is changed

​

A very lucid Harry Potter does what every lucid person would have done: runs! Dumbles cannot let him go ( Luna x Harry)

​

IMO, the most inovative AU : Harry Potter cannot use a wand, but he can use his joystick. Harry-multiple; Harry against males ( actually take a look at the author other fics- the true daughter of the Blacks has also a very interesting A.U and Bill Weasley is the bad guy there)

​

Literally laughed my ass off...the will reading is a work of art. Did not like the middle as much, but the ending is also fine.

BTW, do you have any recs too? Looking for something new...
