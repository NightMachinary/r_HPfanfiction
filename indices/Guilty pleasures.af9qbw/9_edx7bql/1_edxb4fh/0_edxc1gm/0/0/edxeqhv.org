linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10974516/chapters/24435873]]) fics like this where Hermione goes back in time to meet her while at school and stop her decent to madness interest me but again time travel can be too much of a cop out for some people and this one seems like it will go unfinished :( . Alot of the pairing is just smutty one shots nearly always bellatrix kidnapping Hermione and very dub con....I get it Bellatrix is the ultimate "mistress type" and people love all the whips and chains stuff lol but I need a little romance or emotional connection to get invested please people!! haha though...I'd maybe like to see something with a dark Hermione who maybe captures Bella alive after the war and have her put Bella in her place for once :)
