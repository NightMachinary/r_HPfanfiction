I'd love a story where Bellatrix gets together with Hermione without torturing her or killing Sirius. Sadly, the Bellamione community seems to be in favour of making their relationship as problematic as possible instead of doing what is common in Harry/Bellatrix and consider a decade in Azkaban as sufficient punishment (or they write out her crimes altogether, something which I am not a fan of).
