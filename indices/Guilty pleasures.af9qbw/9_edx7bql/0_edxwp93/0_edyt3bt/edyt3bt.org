linkao3:([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15842229/chapters/36893670]]) this fic pink and blue is what got me into hermione/luna really long(maybe the longest Luna/Hermione fic ever written not sure) mostly fluffy cute fun for ages but got a plot later on and is going a tad dark now bellatrix is a character also a tad smutty at times.

linkao3:([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2573990/chapters/5726924]]) then theres the famous crazy little things probably the most loved Luna/Hermione fic in the tiny amount of fics there are but the longer pink and blue goes on the more it may take the crown.

linkffn:([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7693287/1/]]) This is a good Pansy/Hermione one imo

​

linka03([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6623722/chapters/15156934]]) fond of this Hermione/Pansy one as well

​

linkao3:([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6339199/chapters/14523508]]) This Pansy/Hermione is a fav but it starts as pure smutty but gets a tad more romatic with plot as it goes on
