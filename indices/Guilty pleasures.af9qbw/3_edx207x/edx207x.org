I really like smart evil characters as protagonists:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106): Harrymort is evil, without question. He even admitted that "murder was a great stress reliever". On the other hand, his thought process, his actions and their consequences are totally hilarious.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929): Grindelwald, although having a noble goal, really struggled in not committing some serious atrocities. Despite his 'restraint', he and his followers compiled a huge body count, and spread chaos and wars all over Europe. Harry and his friends really profited from all that mess.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12614436/1/Hermione-Granger-Demonologist][Hermione Granger, Demonologist]], linkffn(12614436): This Hermione is definitely evil as she considered Voldemort an ally and furthered his and the devil's cause, but she's so adorable at same time.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): Ok, maybe this Harry is still only a vigilante, but he and his friends are getting progressively more brutal and ruthless as the story goes on.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8192853/1/Yes-I-am-Harry-s-Brother][Yes, I am Harry's Brother]], linkffn(8192853): Despite his murders and creepy relationship with Tonks, I do enjoy this fic and its Voldemort.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6160345/1/My-Slytherin-Harry][My Slytherin Harry]], linkffn(6160345): Maybe they are not evil yet, but this Harry/Ginny pair really likes to torture their enemies.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10972919/1/The-Evil-Overlord-List][The Evil Overlord List]], linkffn(10972919): Tom and 'Jerry' make a superbly evil duo.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12980210/1/I-Am-Lord-Voldemort][I am Lord Voldemort?]], linkffn(12980210): A new fic I recently found in which an SI replaced Tom Riddle. Still extremely evil, but at least this person's evil has much better purposes.
