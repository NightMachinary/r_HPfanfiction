Well, I don't have any when it comes to ships, but I do like stories where the main character gets magically (or whatever) changed into a girl and the story then proceeds to pick up the pieces. Although really I just like stories where the main character is a girl but at the same time want them to not be too out-of-character from the get-go, and it's quite common for people who write stories where the character has always been of the opposite sex to end up making the character in question too different.

Also, stories where the main character provides a lovely commentary about anything and everything, such as “Seventh Horcrux” ... or Haruhi ('tis a Japanese thing), because in the light novels Kyon snarks at everything like 110% of the time.
