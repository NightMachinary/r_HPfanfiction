That's definitely my go-to guilty pleasure. It's fun, funny, and a masterfully executed "OP, time-travel, ass-kicking Harry just kicking ass left and right." It's roughly novella length and knows not to overstay its welcome or over-do the jokes (my major complaint about the other two well-regarded comedies - A Black Comedy and Seventh Horcrux).

But, it's not very good as an actual, dramatic story. Plus, its got this disquieting vibe of misogyny and a heavy dollop of assholery. I /shouldn't/ like Harry as much as I do (sorta like how you're /not supposed to like/ Walter White in Breaking Bad). So yeah. Guilty pleasure for sure.
