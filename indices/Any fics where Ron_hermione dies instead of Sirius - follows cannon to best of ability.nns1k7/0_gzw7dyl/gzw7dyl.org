Awesome idea! I really think more fanfic authors need to have some of the kids die during the DOM fight, if just to show the Death Eaters are fucking seriously bad business in a world without plot armor. Ron/Hermione both dying there would do that, and also give Harry some great character development going forward.

Maybe it would make Harry reconsider the insane idea of bringing kids along with him to confront who he seriously believed was Voldemort himself torturing Sirius. Seriously what the hell did he expect they were going to do? Face off against Voldemort and win? Without plot armor, and if Voldemort really was there from the start, they all would have died.

Make it a disaster and have all his friends get killed, and Harry has to live with that being his fault. He could seriously reconsider his reckless idiocy in face of real deadly threats. Just because you get lucky before doesn't mean you get lucky again.
