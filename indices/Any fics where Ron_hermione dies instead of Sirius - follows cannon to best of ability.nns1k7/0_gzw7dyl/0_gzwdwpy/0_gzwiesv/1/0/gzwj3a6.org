Yeah, thanks! Already got some ideas on how this would alter canon. For one thing, he smashed the prophecy in front of the Death Eaters, which means Lucius could use a pensieve to let Voldemort explore his memory of that moment and hear the prophecy in full - if Lucius didn't hear it himself (the only reason Harry got away is that he let him go because of that, maybe).

For another, sort of wondering if Harry wouldn't try to make new friends in a desperate bid to get back what he lost. Maybe turn it into a Harry Lavender thing. Or Harry Parvati. Not sure. xD After a major withdrawal and depression period, maybe. Except I'd want him to get actual mental health help for this shit...

Either way, it could be a nice way to have Harry make other friends.
