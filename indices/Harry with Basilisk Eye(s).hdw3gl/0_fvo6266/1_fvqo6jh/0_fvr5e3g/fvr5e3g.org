The summary for this story has one line of text (17 words. "As he slays the Basilisk, Harry is doused in blood and venom......some gets in his eyes."

It then has 22 lines of Character tags and then 21 lines of additional tags. Basically 158 tags (369 words).

The bot is good for giving you the summary of the story and some information in terms of completion status, published date, word count etc. But the real benefit is the summary. Using the bot for a tag heavy fic is not worth it. You would get one line of summary and then more than a page of tags.
