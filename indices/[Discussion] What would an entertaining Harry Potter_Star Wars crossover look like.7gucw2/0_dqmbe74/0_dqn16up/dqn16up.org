I agree on putting Potter characters in the Star Wars universe being way more interesting than the reverse, but I don't necessarily think multiple transfers is a bad thing. The problem isn't having too many Potter characters, it's having too many characters in general. If you have the entire Potter cast plus every Jedi Master ever, how are all of them going to get screen time to make each interesting and something readers look forward to?

The aspect I would want to see/write that I don't feel like has been done properly before is synergy. I feel like wizards and Jedi/Sith should be complementary, each side bringing something that the other either can't do at all, or at least can't do effectively.

For example, Force users aren't bothered by just about any number of blasters, so I would have a Shield Charm not protect against energy weapons. On the flip side, nothing the Jedi can do can match apparition or transfiguration. The universe I imagine has both light and dark wizards as much as light and dark Force users and characters with similar goals would gravitate together. Palpatine has Voldemort while Yoda has Dumbledore sort of thing.

The reason I bring it up in response to your post is that balance is a lot easier to achieve (or pretend) if your characters have different strengths. Then their strength becomes situational rather than just a flat hierarchy of Yoda = Palpatine > Obi-Wan = Harry > Ron = Jar Jar or something.

Of course, in my potential universe a wizard can't be Force sensitive and vice versa. Technically. Like anything else, rules are made to be bent (but not broken). >:)
