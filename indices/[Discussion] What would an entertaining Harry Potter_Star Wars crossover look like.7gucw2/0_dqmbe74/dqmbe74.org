The hardest part is keeping balance (pun intended). Like, if you just add Harry to the story and have his abilities be super OP and everything rolls over to his jaw-dropping magical prowess, it's hard to keep the story interesting. Sadly, that seems like where a lot of SW crossovers end up, and while some of them manage to keep it entertaining for a few chapters, eventually it just turns into the same old shit we've all read a million times.

I'm currently working on an HP/SW crossover myself, so I feel like I have some insight, and let me tell you, it's a ton of work to balance everything. I did it for the nanowrimo challenge, so I'm sitting on slightly over 50,000 words in the story (a bit over 8 chapters), but I've come across the opposite problem. I've normalized things slightly too much, using simplistic reasoning as to why Harry can't just save the entire universe with a few OP spells, and coupled with my own mediocre to average writing style where everything comes off as slightly too boring, it's a real struggle.

As for your specific points- 1) Harry doesn't need to be the one to save the galaxy personally. Worldbuilding and character examination is more interesting imo, but there always has to be an ultimate goal. I don't like the idea of Harry just being the unknown guy lurking out there who sighs and goes "fine, I'll save you, just give me a minute" and then does everything with minimal difficulty.

2) Clone Wars is my favorite era. It seems to be the most popular one as well. I think a lot of that is to do with just how good the Clone Wars tv show turned out to be, and also because that's the era we probably just have the most information on. There was also a lot of good video games during this era. I don't really find late Galactic Empire that interesting, and going earlier into Old Republic results in not very original stories I've found (though I've only seen a few).

3) Honestly, I find HP being in the SW galaxy waaaaaaaay more interesting than the reverse. Adding in more HP characters other than HP tends to be an unneeded distraction. Like, you don't need portraits of his past wives to lord after him, or Luna as some army general. It's just baggage. Give Harry a clean slate.

Lastly, I know there's plenty of people that just want good SW crossovers to read. There's too few of them. I can count them on one hand with fingers still left over. So pretty much any story at this point is worthy of consideration. You just have to be very careful about how you portray Harry, and be careful of falling into the same traps that have ruined other SW crossovers. Maybe think twice if you decide to make him a bounty hunter/jedi/sith, and be careful about how you want to portray magic in a universe that has the Force.
