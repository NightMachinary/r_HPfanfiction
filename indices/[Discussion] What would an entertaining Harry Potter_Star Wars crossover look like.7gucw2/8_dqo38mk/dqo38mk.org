I agree with that others have stated - the best fics tend to be where Harry is inserted into the SW universe.

Now that isn't to say you ~couldn't~ do it the other way around, but you would have to do it without the tech. In every x-over with SW chars/powers into the HP universe, you inevitably have the massive difference in tech levels arise, where the protagonist has to whip up some tie fighters or some such.

Because, really, you need the tech to make the lightsaber. And who doesn't love lightsabers?

As an idea, consider a bungle in the jungle style adventure, Harry going curse breaking with Bill, somewhere in Africa (because hey, that place is huge and grossly underused in fanfics), where they/he discovers an ancient sith/jedi temple. All ruins, no tech to speak of. Maybe a damaged holocron stuck on repeat, beyond repair (first repair spell on it shorts it out and it disentergrates or some such). Harry is incredibly engrossed/attracted to the idea of a monastic / mystic order.

Go from there. No light sabers (unless you sneak them with magic instead of tech), no insane tech. I'd read it.
