  The Lightsaber was like that if i remember correctly.

No it wasn't, that's what I'm saying. The author brought in a bunch of bullshit about "sorcery" which was basically magic used like the Force, and it was automatically evil and created a ton of manufactured drama that ruined the story.

Unless I'm mixing it up with a completely different story, but the fourth chapter of The Lightsaber is called Sorcery so i think it's the same fic. I can't really read the whole thing right now.
