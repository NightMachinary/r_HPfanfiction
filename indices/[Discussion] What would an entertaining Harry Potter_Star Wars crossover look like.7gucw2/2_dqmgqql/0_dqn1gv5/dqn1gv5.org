I like this approach, though they don't necessarily have to be reborn into the universe. I could see a timeline something like:

- Harry defeats Voldemort canon style
- Some stuff happens
- Harry and whoever else gets flung into the SW universe
- Some years later, after HP characters get used to the universe, the story starts.

Doing it like that retains a lot more of the Harry Potter character and the feeling of being a stranger, but also doesn't bog the story down explaining all the details to Harry and others.

My plot bunny with the Fidelius protecting Jedi from the purge actually starts with Harry and friends being couriers/smugglers. They started legit shipping, but realized magic's ability to hide things could make them a lot more credits for little more risk. The Harry and friends that finally meet the Jedi not only have a bit of universe knowledge, but also are a bit scruffier from their adventures.
