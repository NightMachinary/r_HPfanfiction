Personal I would love to see more of a Side Story, that either doesn't often or doesn't at all intersect with the main story line. Like Harry ends up in the SW Universe with a Friend or two builds a small crew of like a Battle Droid and some cool aliens and then become Smugglers/Bounty hunters. Do we see Light sabers and Jedi? Fuck yeah! Is that the main plot? No, it's more about grabbing that next paycheck and carving a bigger piece of the world for themselves.

Use of different Droids, OC Droids. No reason for The MC to always have 3PO, R2 and or BB-8 or even worse HK47. Their are trillions of Droids, it doesn't have to be the 4 of them. Same goes for Jedi. Use the EU it's not Canon but it still exist
