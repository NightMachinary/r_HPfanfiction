There are a couple ways how a good crossover could work. There's "I still haven't found what I am looking for" in which MoD Harry takes care of Ashoka after she leaves the Order. IMO it would work better as a Harry/Ashoka instead of the muti pairing but that is just me. linkffn(11157943)

Harry saving Naboo would be an interesting premise, especially if he decides to train Anakin in magic instead of leaving him at the temple. Anakin grows up with his mother (I doubt it would be that difficult to liberate her, especially with magic) and close to Padme. Stuff is going well until the Clone Wars start and Harry, Anakin and Padme get sucked into the mess.

Harry reincarnated as Vader would make a good crackfic with him helping the Rebels or outright defecting.

There was a story in which Ashoka was thrown across dimensions and ended up raising Harry but I disliked that one because it was a Weasley and Lupin wankfest. But the premise of Ashoka being thrown into the HP universe has a lot of potential. Imagine Harry introducing his girlfriend Ashoka and everyone is freaking out because they think she is some sort of Demon.
