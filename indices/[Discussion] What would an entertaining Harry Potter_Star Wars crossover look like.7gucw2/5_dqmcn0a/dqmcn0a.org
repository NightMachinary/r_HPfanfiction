For me personally, getting the lore right to a certain degree is important, and any significant change better has a proper explanation attached to it. And I still consider myself being quite lax lore-wise. Just try to read some of the elitists' discussions out there...

Secondly, but this is one of the most important aspects to me when it comes to crossovers - the power balance. I don't like reading about Harry (or anyone, really) curbstomping his problems through the story (unless it's a crackfic, or comedy). But I will hate it even more, if a character, who was described as powerful and smart and experienced, suddenly got nerfed and acted like a fool for the sake of drama.
