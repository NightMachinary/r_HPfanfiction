I'll dump some I enjoyed:

linkffn(6353083);\\
plums's version of the above, linkffn(9068231), and his co-writer's story, linkffn(11157943);\\
most of Darth Marrs's stuff, including linkffn(11576387) and linkffn(10912355).

Preferred era would probably be the Clone Wars. A lot a variation in characters, plot lines to get involved in, and a generally less-totalitarian government, among other reasons.
