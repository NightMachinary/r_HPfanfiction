For me? Use the EU - not the new canon (Seriously story wise the new canon sucks! As do the characters...Rey is bland and overpowered (Mary-Sue!), Finn is just boring and not very competent (ok: What do you expect he's a stormtrooper), Poe doesn't have enough screen time to say much abaout him, Leia pisses me off (in the EU she is a fighter as well as a politician and a great diplomat, the new canon frankly shunts her into the role of military leader which wasn't really what Leia was supposed to be IMHO), Han isn't worth talking about (thanks Harrison Ford you asshole!), Chewie was always the side kick...and don't get me started on the fan-boy: Kylo "I live to fail" Ren, who gets beaten by an untrained girl and looks like an emo-kid (who ever selected this guy for the role really needs to see a doctor or something because you can't be this dumb IMHO!)...sorry, but I am more afraid of Child-Anakin than of him because I know that baby-ani becomes Darth "I find your lack of faith disturbing" Vader!) - and make it an epic! Make Harry immortal (or at least ageless and very hard to kill!) and make him show up at all the key moments (maybe even without influencing much, hell let him only give the main characters important nudges...with exceptions, seeing someone apparate with a lightsaber or turn invisible etc.? Yeah, tactical advantage baby!) but also give him something to do (I've read one where he's looking for Sirius and had jumped into the veil after liquidating all his assets and preparing for all eventualities)...nothing is worse than a powerful character with nothing to do

ps: But also don't make it a comedy! So no crazy Dobby killing people in creative ways while insulting Harry or something like that...!
