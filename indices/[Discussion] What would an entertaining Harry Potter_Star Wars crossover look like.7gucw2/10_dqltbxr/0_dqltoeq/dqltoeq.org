Powerless or incompetent villains annoy me quickly in any story, regardless of medium. Characters that have everything they want just aren't that interesting. Heroes don't always win and even when they do, pyrrhic victories are the best victories.

For example, sure, adult Harry would probably get along okay with some of the Jedi/Padme/whoever else. At the same time, Lucius Malfoy and Tom Riddle would both love Palpatine, particularly before the dissolution of the Galactic Senate.

Unrelated: I just imagined a scene where Draco meets Jar Jar. That could be /highly/ entertaining.
