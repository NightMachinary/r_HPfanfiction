Shrug. These fantasy analogues never work well, because the fantasy stuff has too many extras.

But yeah, as far as we can see in canon, house elves generally enjoy being of service. It doesn't really work to compare it to slavery in the US, unless you add or change a bunch of stuff.

For one thing- the wizarding economy wouldn't collapse if house elves went away.
