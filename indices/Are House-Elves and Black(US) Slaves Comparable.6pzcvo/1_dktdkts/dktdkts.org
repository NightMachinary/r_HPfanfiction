Why is the house elf included in the statue at the ministry when they are considered property? I realize this isn't answering your question but it has bothered me. The other two species in the statue are Centaurs and goblins who are sentient and free species. Mermaids aren't included even though they are also sentient and free. If we look at it as a statement, rather than a plot hole, then it should follow that elves should exist in a free state and the enslavement may be a recent thing. Perhaps it was originally bonding that was perverted to enslavement. The other option is that the ministry is stating that centaurs and goblins should also be enslaved. The mermaids are untouchable as they live underwater so the ministry leaves them alone.
