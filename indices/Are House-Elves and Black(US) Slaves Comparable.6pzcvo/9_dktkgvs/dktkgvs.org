I think a big problem is that we judge their society by our society's standards. In the context of our society, yes, they are slaves. Free labor. Hogwarts doesn't pay for them.

Except they kind of do. While I can't point to any references from the books, House-Elves presumably need to eat and sleep. This means that Hogwarts likely provides them with room and board. Again, I have no reference for this, it's just an assumption. What I can say is that Hogwarts treats its House-Elves much better than some other families treat theirs. So if room and board are required, that's money coming out of the Hogwarts budget and going to providing for the House-Elves.

As an attempt to remove our society from the equation, take a look at a different society. In the 1900s, it was a privilege to work in a big house. Working for a well-known, powerful family was something about which you could brag to your friends. Wanting to be a part of the family in the big house was seen as ungrateful, but working for them was acceptable. House-Elves take that to an extreme, yes, but the only big difference is that servants had lives outside of serving. House-Elves don't, and thus have no need for money. Dobby is seen as ungrateful for wanting freedom by the other House-Elves that don't know his circumstances. Even then, it'd be like someone saying "I just want to lounge around and do nothing all day". To House-Elves, you're either being a productive member of society by serving a family or organization, or you're a lazy, good for nothing waste of space.

Could House-Elves get by without serving? Of course they could. Are they slaves by our society's standards? Yes. But by their society's standards, they are hard-working, necessary elements of a society above their own.
