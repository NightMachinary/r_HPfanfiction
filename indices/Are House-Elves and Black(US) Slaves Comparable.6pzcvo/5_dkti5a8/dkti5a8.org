My thinking is that for most house-elves, their entire sense of identity, honor, and self-worth is tied to service. So in that way they're unlike many human slaves - a house elf likely has never imagined /not/ being a servant, and if they did they wouldn't know what to do with themselves. This is distinct from human slaves.

But the two concepts are certainly *comparable*, even if they are different.
