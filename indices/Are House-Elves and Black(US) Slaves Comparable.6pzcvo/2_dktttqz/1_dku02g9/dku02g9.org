Of the three named elves, all three of them loved working for a master. Dobby hated the Malfoys but he was an outlier. Kreacher was extremely loyal to the Black family - his previous masters told him, in ways he may have taken as an order, that Sirius is not a member of that family anymore. As far as Kreacher was concerned, Sirius was a random, disgraceful person who now owned the Black name. He saw Harry the same way until Harry helped him complete his previous orders to destroy the Locket - Kreacher then served Harry to the point where he actually ran into battle to assist him.
