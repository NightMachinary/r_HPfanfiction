Of course house-elves are comparable to slaves - they are slaves in Harry Potter. They are sapient beings with emotions, able to reason and speak. And yet they are property of wizards, magically compelled to obey them, to the point of hurting themselves as punishment. They can be tortured and cannot leave, not even flee.

The very first elf we meet is abused, hates serving his evil owners, wants to be free, gets to be free, and is very happy to be free. Of the three named elves we meet, two hated serving their owners, and would have left them at once if they could, and the third was banished for no fault of her own, after serving faithfully for decades - which would drive anyone to depression.

More importantly, Dobby proves that house-elves don't need to be slaves, meaning that all the drivel about house-elves culture, and respecting how they want to be slaves is garbage - and a stark reminder of the start of the new "Birth of Nation" movie, where the slave owners want Nate Turner to teach the other slaves that God wants them to obey their masters. If that had succeeded, would we claim that Blacks want to be slaves today, and would we talk about how we have to respect their culture? This and the other the fan "argument" about house-elves being better off as slaves parallels the drivel apologists sprouted in defence of slavery in the 19th century. Dobby even speaks like a blackface clichee.

The parallels between house-elves and real life slavery are really obvious.
