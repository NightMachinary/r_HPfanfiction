The main diffrence between a human slave and a house elf except the magical abilities is that house elves are magically forced to obey their masters orders, there isnt even the option of disobeying and facing punishment or the possibility of escape just obeying the orders. to be fair they can interpret order diffrently than they were intended but even then it can be assumed that they would face punishment. I think that because of the magical bond house elves convinced themselves that its only right for them to be enslaved and thats how things are supposed to be. So I think yes they do generally enjoy being enslaved(as long as they dont have to do duties for people they believe to be morally in the wrong) but that is because that is the only way for them to cope with their own enslavement. I also think that generally freeing all house-elves would be a bad idea, but the best way to improve their situation would be to make sure the house-elves are actually with masters they respect and whom they enjoy living with, otherwise they should at least for a while stop bonding newborn house-elves to magical homes and see if the house-elves that grew up free would want to become slaves and if not stop the bonding all together
