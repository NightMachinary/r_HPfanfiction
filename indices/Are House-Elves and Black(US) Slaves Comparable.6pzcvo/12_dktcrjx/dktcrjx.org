No.

House-Elves would be like our intelligent robots in 25-50 years, or like Data in Star Trek, or like the Replicants in Blade Runner.

EDIT: I don't understand the hate I'm getting for my comment. Our real world will soon develop intelligent, if not sentient, 'products', and we will also face the ethical dilemma in how to treat them. Are you going to still treat them as 'traditional' products, which means you can abuse and destroy them whenever you like; or treat them as fellow intelligent species and grant them significant, if not equal, legal rights?

EDIT: House-Elves Rights are not something abstract or fictional issue for me, because a very similar situation is shaping up in real world.
