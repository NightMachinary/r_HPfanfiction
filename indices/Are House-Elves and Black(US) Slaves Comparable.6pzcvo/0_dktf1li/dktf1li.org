This is a whole big discussion, so I'll just point something out about Winky.

Let's forget for a moment that she's a house-elf. Pretend that she is a human maidservant who had spent her whole life working for a family (as had her mother before her, etc., perhaps), changing diapers for their son, watching him grow up, become a terrorist, helping cover up his escape. And then, she is betrayed and dismissed to spare her master embarrassment.

She finds another job, sure, but it feels like taking charity. All the other servants disdain her for having been fired, and the only one who is even remotely supportive is considered to be insane by the others.

Now, how many /humans/ wouldn't drink themselves half to death over that?
