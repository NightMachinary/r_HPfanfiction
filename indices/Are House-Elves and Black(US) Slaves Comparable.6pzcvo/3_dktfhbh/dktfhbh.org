I would say that house elves have been raised/brainwashed to feel like they have to be enslaved. It's not so hard to convince people of something that goes against their best interests as long as you get to them at a young enough age. My grandma was from the old country and was convinced up until her dying day that women's brains were smaller, and when it came to her kids and grandkids she practically had to be their slave because that was her main purpose in life.

So the house elves feeling compelled to punish themselves and to dread the very idea of being freed doesn't seem unrealistic. I would imagine certain slaves throughout history have felt the same. It's easier to break free of that horrible thinking when you're treated as badly as Dobby was and slaves in the Americas were.

We don't know the origins of house elves, but we do know they can be happy free. Dobby only seems to benefit from being freed. He is understandably used as a comical relief, what with his adorable mismatched socks and diminutive size, but his craziness is anything but funny. Imagine being forced to violently punish yourself repeatedly for doing things you know are not in your best interest, like trying to make sure Harry Potter doesn't die a horrific death. Imagine having to punish yourself for almost speaking ill of the people who mentally and physically abuse you. I think that'd break a lot of people. That Dobby is able to come out of it with morals, some sanity, his magic, and a determination to make something of his life is impressive. But you can't just forget everything you've been brainwashed to believe since birth, especially when you've lived as a slave for hundreds of years (as house elves are long lived). So it's no wonder Dobby falls back on doing the only thing he's known, being a servant. And it's no wonder he thinks he can be happy doing that.

I think most fics that say house elves wouldn't have magic or long lives, etc if they didn't have a bond are trying to make that slavery okay because a lot of people (myself included) like the idea of a servant who happily goes about and keeps everything clean and doesn't really take much in the way of maintenance (room and board, pay, being treated like an actual sentient being, etc). I'd love it if I never had to do dishes, take out the trash, or mop again. So I can see the appeal of owning something that does all that and can aparate you out of a tricky situation. And just because you might treat your slave well doesn't mean you're still not a slave owner. Also, the facility with which Dobby blasts Lucius Malfoy away from Harry in CoS after he's been freed suggests that house elves are not dependent on wizards for their power.

My favorite origin story for house elves is in "Not Not-Human" by Forensica X, a Harry Potter x Doctor Who crossover. Basically, wizards were jealous of elves, which were powerful creatures, so centuries ago they enslaved them and warped them until they became the small creatures we see in canon. They magically bound them so that they couldn't be free. Not because elves naturally needed to bond to humans. Excellent story in non-house elf aspects too. Human David Tennant Doctor and Rose raise Harry. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10462166/1/Not-Not-Human]]

In "Blindness" by AngelaStarCat, the house elves are dependent on a symbiotic relationship with wizards for their magic and for longer lives. However, Harry sets about changing the law so they're paid and have to be treated decently. An unexpected character opens what's basically a house elf staffing agency. WIP. Blind Harry who grew up to "see" magic since he can't see normally. An OP Harry who isn't a Gary Stu, but a complex character. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness]]

To sum it all up, as we don't know the origins of house elves, we can't say they're exactly like how slaves in the americas were, but they're very similar in how they were treated and how society viewed them. I would say they've been raised/brainwashed to believe that slavery makes them happy.
