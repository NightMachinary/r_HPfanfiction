I think your points have a few merits. I certainly see the comparison between House Elves and slaves, especially the ideology that the 'regimes of truth' aka the Wizarding World push. Just because house elves have been brainwashed into thinking that they cannot live without being enslaved, doesn't mean that they can't. Just a thought.
