Grindelwald was a Dark Lord of magic, so powerful and so wise he could wield the Elder Wand. He had such a knowledge of the Deathly Hallows that he could even stop death. Dark magic is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful, the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately he taught his lover everything he knew, then his lover defeated him in a duel and locked him in his own prison. Ironic. He sought the Hallows but they could not save him.
