/Alt. Universe: Fudge was right in OtP. Dumbledore is seeking more power and trying to take over as the singular authority in the Ministry. Unfortunately, nobody believes him and most people see it as him losing it due to stress from previous events./

"Are you threatening me, Master Auror?", asks Dumbledore in his usual grandfatherly manner.\\
"The Ministry will decide your fate.", Dawlish replies.

"I AM THE MINISTRY!"
