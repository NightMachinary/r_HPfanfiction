Felix Fortuna: Fortuna (Contessa) wipes her memories and de-ages herself through PtV means. Really only mentioned in the first chapter. From the second chapter onwards the story features orphan Fortuna getting a Hogwarts letter, going to Hogwarts, making friends, confronting mysteries (at least those mysteries she doesn't want an immediate PtV granted answer to), etc. My favorite HP/Worm crossover of the few available.
