I started it per your recommendation and it's excellent. Completely new characters in the beloved boarding school scenario, with /some/ allusions to the original HP story but almost entirely stand-alone. The one turn-off was that the series is based on America. Charmbridge is a very well-written school, but there's nothing quite like the quiet, quaint mystery of Hogwarts. :)

This is the sort of story I'm looking for, for sure. Completely 100% original characters based on the HP world. If anyone has any stories similar to this, please hit me up!
