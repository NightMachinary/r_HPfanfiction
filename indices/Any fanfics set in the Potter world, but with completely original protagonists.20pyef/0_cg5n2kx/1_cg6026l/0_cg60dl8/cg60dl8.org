Glad I could introduce someone to it. :)

It's a really well fleshed out version of Wizarding America that is neither a carbon copy of Wizarding Britain nor a MURICA-esque caricature where magical America is so much better than backwards ass Britain, which is what you often see in fics featuring America. I really like it.
