Do you mind next-gen? I'm rec'ing adventure fics/fics similar in tone to the original series but I also know shorter fics and more humor-based OC stories if you'd like those too.

- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=293736][It's Called Adventure]] is fun adventure fic with Hugo, Scorpius, and a now-Professor Neville, where they go on a hunt through the Forbidden Forest - /If romping through the Forbidden Forest on week-long escapades to hunt for a mythical plant doesn't seem normal to you, then you haven't met Hugo Weasley. Hinkypunks, nymphs, Acromantulas? Not a problem for this ragtag team of ordinary heroes./
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=290483][Morocco]] is a Rose/Scorpius action fic with great writing quality; reads like a film - /The world is in chaos. Fear reigns and the Wizarding world is in danger of falling to its new enemy - muggles. The Ministry has become a paramilitary organisation, determined to go down fighting. Sent to Northern Africa, Rose must help infiltrate the group responsible for such terror. War is imminent. The only question is, when?/
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=272808][Al Potter and His Very Epic Plan]] is about Al wanting to be sorted in Slytherin as part of his... epic plan! /Al's dad told him that Slytherin was all right, and that means it isn't fair how people treat them. Al's realized he has to fix this, and the return of the Triwizard Tournament to Hogwarts after 23 years might be the perfect opportunity to do so./
