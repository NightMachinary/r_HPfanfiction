Ah! That's much harder to find. I like to rec [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=288707][With the Devil]], set in Salem during the witch hunts and reads like a historical fiction (but not set in Hogwarts unfortunately). A far far sillier fic is [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=307662][Muggle Studies]], which has a few canon characters flitting in and out, but is mostly about the woes of the next-gen era's Muggle Studies professor.
