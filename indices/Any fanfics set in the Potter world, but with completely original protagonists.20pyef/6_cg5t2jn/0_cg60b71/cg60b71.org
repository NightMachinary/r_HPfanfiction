I don't mind next-gen, but I'm not a fan of reading about Hugo or Scorpius, or any of the next-gen characters. If you have a story set in that time-frame that follows the life of a random Hufflepuff fourth-year, or a Ravenclaw sixth-year, or perhaps a group of Gryffindor friends or shady Slytherin bullies... that's the sort of stuff I'm looking for.

In other words, if the character was mentioned /at all/ in the novels, he can't be a protagonist. This includes characters as minor as Fabian Prewett, Avery, Benjy Fenwick, and Hagrid's father.
