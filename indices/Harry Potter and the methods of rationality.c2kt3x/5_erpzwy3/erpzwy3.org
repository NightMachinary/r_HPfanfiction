Both times I've tried to read it, the 15 chapter long Azkaban sequence drains my will to live and I drop it.

I can tolerate an obnoxious main character who is an author self insert that speaks like the front page of [[/r/iamverysmart][r/iamverysmart]] all the time. I can deal with the Ender's Game nonsense, even the Moste Ancient Blade shite. I can even bear the whole "Quirrell is obviously a bad dude yet Harry continually stays close to him" thing.

But when you stretch a sequence that needed, at most, 3 chapters into being essentially a novel in its own right? And when you accomplish this mainly by having unnecessarily long internal monologues and page after page of ranting about transhumanism and dementors or nuclear weapons as an allegory for the author's opinions on AI research? Then you lose my good will and I give up trying.

It's a shame. The first third or so, where a smart science loving Harry applies scientific principles to magic, works on getting Draco to prove pureblood supremacy is nonsense etc was super promising. But then it essentially abandons that idea in favour of becoming Ender's Game and then becoming a weird Prison Break story.
