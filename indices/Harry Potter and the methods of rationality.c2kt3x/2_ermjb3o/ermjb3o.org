It's got some amazingly good and absolutely terrible properties.

It's quite well-written, the humor is quite good, it's got action, good worldbuilding, creative use of spells, a Voldemort who isn't a complete idiot and actual foreshadowing and clues.

But the main characters are all eleven year olds who act like young adults, and Harry's a complete jerk.

If you're willing to overlook the issue of firsties casting advanced spells all the time and discussing quantum physics, it's a pretty damn good fic.
