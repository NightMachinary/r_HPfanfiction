What @thrkleon was saying: there are people for whom it is THE BEST fanfiction ever, or perhaps the only fanfiction they are willing to read. There are other people who didn't like it for various reasons. I am in the second category (not overly aggressive, there are some parts which are interesting), but whenever I say it aloud, I am attacked by herd of wild gnus for desecrating their beloved story.
