There are a surprising amount of them, yeah. None where Harry is oblong though, just weird and esoterically mind-bending. :)

Firstly, my personal favourite is a series called 'The Master of Death, Eldritch Abomination' - [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/532063]] - where Harry got the Hallows and became Eldritch over a long period of time.

There's 'It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I feel fine)' - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12748842/1/It-s-the-End-of-the-World-as-We-Know-It-And-I-Feel-Fine]] - where Harry is sorta half Lovecraftian God-Thing. It's quite a comedic attempt at Lovecraft. Emphasis on attempt. :D

I'm not sure if Monstrous counts - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12754810/1/Monsterous]] - but he's relatively demonic in that, IIRC. I think it might've been for Eldritch-ey reasons?

If you don't mind crossovers, there's The Master of Death - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7779108/1/]] - which is a crossover with the Dresden Files.

The Nightmare Man is another 'sort of but not quite what you want' thing - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10182397/1/]]

I have to run for an appointment rn, but I think I've got more somewhere so I'll check when I'm back.
