There's linkffn(9911469) which starts out with a bit of a Lovecraftian feel though it moves into a bit more of a comedic tone as the story goes on. Cosmic horror elements remain but aren't shown to the reader in that tone. The problem is that the POV character is effectively the Eldritch Horror but doesn't see it in those terms. So, you have lots of events happening that would be straight out of Lovecraft and many side characters reacting appropriately but the POV is reacting as though it is no big deal.
