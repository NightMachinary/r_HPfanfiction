No, I don't think it is controversial because of PC reasons. It is really not very good, because it carries so many tropes, which make the story so clich√©, that (for me) it is almost unreadable. However, it was some time I tried to read it (I haven't finished), so I don't give you exact details. Lord Potter, unending wealth, goblins fixing everything, etc. All those tropes are there. Yes, the story is so old, that it wasn't that overused in these times, but now it is really hard to read.
