While everyone is entitled to their taste, calling a fic controversial just because you don't like it is, to be frank, dishonest.

The story is actually pretty typical of the time and helped create the tropes we're tired of now. I don't remember any Lord Potter or unending wealth, just a Harry raised by McGonagalls family in America. It was unrepentantly H/Hr with typical 2006 bashing, and so it's concepts are old, and maybe not to everyone's taste, but that is not controversial.
