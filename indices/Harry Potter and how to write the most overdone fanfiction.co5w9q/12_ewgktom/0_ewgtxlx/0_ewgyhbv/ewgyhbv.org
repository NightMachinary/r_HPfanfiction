I don't mind an animagus form - I mind a whole lot an animagus form that never contributes to the rest of the story.

It's the same with showing Harry's vast wealth in a lot of bad fics - so what? What difference does it make when he spends all his time in Hogwarts and doesn't buy anything that makes it so he needed more wealth than what is shown in canon?

Anton Chekhov would be so disappointed.
