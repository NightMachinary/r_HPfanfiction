I don't mind that as long as the story has some purpose for Harry to have that much wealth. Hell, even showing !HedonismHarry flitting from island to island that he owns with his harem would be a purpose. Not one I'd care to read about it, but there are people who want to read about that kind of thing.

The thing that is closer to objectively bad writing, if there is such a thing, is having Harry be mega-rich and never doing anything with it.
