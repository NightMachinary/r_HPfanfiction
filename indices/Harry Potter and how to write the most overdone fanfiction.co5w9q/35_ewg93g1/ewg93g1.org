You know why it's so popular? Because one person did it well, others copied and now everyone wants to do it. It's all trite, no uniqueness at all. Anything new and well-done (or just new) gets little to no views because it hasn't been tested and proven to be enjoyable for readers.

I do agree with the list though.
