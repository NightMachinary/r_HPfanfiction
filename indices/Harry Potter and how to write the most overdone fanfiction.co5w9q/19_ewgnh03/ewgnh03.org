I've found that I like the stories where Harry gets to be a kid. And I think it's because I really never got that chance so I like to live it through stories. I'm actually been posting a fic like that, where he gets to do kid things while the adults take care of the war.

Though I do have an Evil Dumbledore, it's not in a stereotypical way.
