This is something that has been on my mind the last couple days. I have some additions, some for fics where LV/TR is a main character.

He disappears for some time, something life-changing happens, he comes back a changed man - bad-ass motherfucker, darkish, blood mage, necromancer, dark wizard - ah no, it's a Dark wizard.

Long paragraphs of rants full of righteous anger, where Harry spreads out all the numerous wrongs that have been done to him by Dumbledore/the Wizarding world/his ‘so-called'/‘ex-‘/‘former' friends/the Dursleys.

Explosions of rage - again the righteous anger.

For some reason he gets a new name - whether he has to make a new identity, discovers his hidden ancestry - not James Potter's son! - or becomes Voldemort's right-hand man - and it's always something edgy and cooool.

He awakens ancient demon-blood magic-arcanist-mage-druid-high elemental powers.

He is stronger than all other wizards besides /maybe/ Dumbledore and LV and can duel them all into the ground after only a few months of training.

Dark cloaks.

Loads and loads of secrets. Secret powers, secret new friends, secret identity, secret secrets.

Did I mention the righteous teenagey anger?

The horcruxes made LV crazy and he finds a way to unite them with him so he isn't crazy anymore.

Or: Dumbledore used propaganda to paint LV in a bad light - he's really not that bad.

Or: Dumbledore dosed LV with a potion/put him under a curse that made him crazy.

For a slash fic: Harry is small and delicate and thin and cries easily and gets pregnant and generally fits the stereotype of a submissive woman to the t - only difference being his dick.
