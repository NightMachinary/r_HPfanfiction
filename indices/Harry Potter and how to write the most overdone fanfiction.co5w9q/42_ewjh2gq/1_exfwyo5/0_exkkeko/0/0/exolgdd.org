I mean at least the Harriet is marginally better than any of the Harold-of-the-stupidly-long-surname.

If you like that type of fic, the power to you though, but I just give up with them because most of them have a really unrealistic level of abuse in them, or are so unique in a story that they /probably/ should be a story of their own.

I get that it's most likely the easiest name to use as a genderbend, but there are hundreds of other names you could use, and you settle for Harriet? 'Kay then.

It's one of the reasons I love linkffn(Harry Potter and The... Wait, Scratch That by jobob) It's different and yeah okay, kinda tropy, but is really well done.
