It depends, like yeah, he's the biggest asshole going and is pretty much the wizarding world's version of Benito Mussolini, but I would think that he would know how to behave in proprietary settings, even if he didn't want to if it's only just to one-up them. High society would come down on him like a ton of bricks if he didn't.

I honestly get the feeling that he'd do it then once it was over, go home and bitch about it because it strikes me as a very Malfoy thing to do.

I assume it would be similar to him not bowing to the Queen in a crowded room, as an example, you don't need to, and are actually exempt it if you have movement issues, but even a bob of the head is more polite than just flat out doing it.

But then, I don't tend to write Lucius much, as I find him a tough character to pin down, so I'm probably wrong.

Edit to correct names.
