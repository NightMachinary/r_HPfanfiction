  -The inheritance test also showed Dumbledore put a block on Harry's magic. The goblins remove it and now Harry is as strong as Merlin.

You forgot the part where the block also sealed his magical abilities. So without it Harry is now a (at least partial metamorphmagus), an animagus with several forms including the incredibly rare Phoenix one and any other bullshit power the author can think off ("Shadowalker" comes to mind)

Of course, not of this abilities will be used more than once and be completely forgotten for the rest of the story.

Oh yeah and Hedwige is a Phoenix too, cause why not
