Omg i am laughing so hard. But everything is true. But the most i Hate is 'Polite Goblins'. However you treat them, it is in their very nature to be cruel and deceptive. It is like Snape is making love dovey eyes at you because suddenly you went brilliant at potions and you greeted him afternoon with a polite Sir and callled him a potions master. Sorry did not mean to ramble and didn't need that mental image. Yakkkk
