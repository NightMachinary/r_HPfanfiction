Reason number 394 why I read fanfics pre-OOTP.

I remember browsing once, and came across about 3 nearly identical stories like this from the same author, then a few more by other authors.

It begins to feel like a website generated story. "Pick Harry's pairing" "Pick Harry's year" "Bashing (Pick atleast 3) - Dumbledore [/] - Ron [/] - Ginny [/] - Molly [/] - Snape [/] - Draco [/] - Hermione []"

Those stories begin to drive me away from my preferred pairings and look for other stories.
