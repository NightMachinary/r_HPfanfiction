I have a better idea; when Harry inherits about a bazillion lordships, and is obliged to wear their lordship rings, but can't fit them all on his fingers at once, the helpful goblins put their heads together to come up with a solution.

A few days of heavy smithing and enchanting work later, Harry comes to Hogwarts wearing a suit of golden chainmail, each and every single individual ring being one of his lordship rings.
