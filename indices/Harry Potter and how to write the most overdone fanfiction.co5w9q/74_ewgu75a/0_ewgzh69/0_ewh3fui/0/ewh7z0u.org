I don't know, man. I've been reading fics for about... 13 years I think? and some of these tropes are just so very common.

It has nothing to do with fic length either. Harry Crow (not linking that) is 737,006 long, and it's pretty much unanimously considered as crap.

It doesn't have to follow every point in the formula, but the ones mentioned are considered the "bad" ones.
