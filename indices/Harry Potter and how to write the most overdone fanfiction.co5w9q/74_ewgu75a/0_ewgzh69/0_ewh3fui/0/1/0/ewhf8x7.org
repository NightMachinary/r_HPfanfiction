Harry is a perfect [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Sue][Mary Sue]] (Mart Stu?) character with pretty much zero flaws. There is no conflict at all in the story. No problem to solve. /Everything/ works just fine because Harry is just THAT awesome.

Hermione's personality completely disappears, leaving a drone who can only think of Harry and what would he say/do/think.

/Hermione couldn't help herself, without even thinking about her actions, she had moved across the carriage to sit beside Harry and already had him in a hug. "Oh Harry, you know I'll help you any way I can."/

*There and then Hermione decided that her new mission in life was to be the best friend she could to Harry, the first boy ever to hug her

Their first interaction.

/They get engaged at eleven/. I mean, if you don't find that absurdly creepy, I just don't know what else to tell you.
