This sort of thing reminds me of an essay I read about how white men have been sold a myth that they're entitled to the world, so they feel cheated when most of them wind up slaving away in cubicles like everyone else. They're waiting for their true identity to be discovered so they'll get handed the kingdom that is their birthright. This isn't just a Harry Potter thing.

Edited to add: The essay is [[https://medium.com/@IjeomaOluo/the-anger-of-the-white-male-lie-6f9a6e646d47][here]] if anyone wants to read it. It's about the phenomenon of the white male mass shooter. It's not racist to acknowledge that this phenomenon exists.

Here's an excerpt:

“White men are the only people allowed to fully believe in the American dream and perhaps that is the cruelest thing to have ever been done to them and the world that has to suffer their anger as they refuse to let go of a fantasy that we were never allowed to imagine ourselves in.”

Edited again to add: This spoof is great, but leaves out a few things, like the house elves Harry inherits. Yes Harry, your ancestors owned slaves, therefore you deserve to own slaves, and they know their place and are delighted to serve you.

Of course the cliche suddenly becoming rich and powerful has universal appeal, but this inheritance trope is more specific than that. This trope says that since your ancestors were rich and powerful, you deserve to be too.
