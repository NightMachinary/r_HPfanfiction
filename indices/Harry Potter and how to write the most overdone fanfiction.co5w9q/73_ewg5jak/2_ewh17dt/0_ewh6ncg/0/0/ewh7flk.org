This is literally the first paragraph of the link you gave me: “School of Resentment is a term coined by critic Harold Bloom to describe related schools of literary criticism which have gained prominence in academia since the 1970s and which Bloom contends are preoccupied with political and social activism at the expense of aesthetic values.[1]”

That's the entire point of Bloom's argument, that we shouldn't let political and social activism diminish our appreciation of important works of literature. I don't think the fics being satirized here qualify.
