True, different tropes cater to different tastes, what I fail to see how either of these fantasies correlate to the reader's or the author's racial background, the first trope you mention is one that you can easily find in Latin soap operas, which millions of people down here enjoyed prior to the internet becoming what it is today. I would know, given I grew up watching them.

The draw of "wealth and power inheritance" is it's convenience and expedience: it comes to you fast, out of nowhere and solves all your problems over night miraculously, like winning the lottery---you really think caucasians are the only ones attracted to such scenario? I'm not white and I can tell you right now I wouldn't mind stumbling upon some titles and gold filled vaults. Not one bit.

I would accept the argument that the trope is directed for people in the medium to lower levels of economic strata, but to make it specifically about white people? That's categorically false and sheltered view, I would say.
