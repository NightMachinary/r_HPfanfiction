The essay is by an American, so it describes US-specific race relations. No doubt people in other countries have different experiences and expectations.

There are various fantastical ways to suddenly solve all your problems. Inheritance is one, but there's also winning the lottery as you mentioned, randomly finding some amazing thing, etc. I think that in the US at least, whites find it easier to imagine themselves in a story about a suddenly inheriting their magnificent birthright than people of other colors would.
