There are different forms of vicarious entertainment. Inheriting great wealth and power just because you happened to be born to the right parents is a specific cliche. I notice that there isn't an overused trope about Harry's fairy godmother giving him beautiful robes so the princess will fall in love with him at the ball and he'll marry into wealth and power, thus live happily ever after. That's a different overused trope, catering to a different audience.
