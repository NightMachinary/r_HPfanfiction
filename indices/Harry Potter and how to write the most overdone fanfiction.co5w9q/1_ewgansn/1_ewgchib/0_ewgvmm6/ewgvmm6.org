He stood in the great Hall, devastated. First Ron had betrayed him, giving him up to Voldemort, then his sister attempted to dose him with love potions. His sorrow penetrated through his magical barriers, breaking down the locks and bindings the old coot had placed upon him. All across the world, Goblins bowed, they'd found their new king. He brought his head up, staring at his final adversary. Voldemort backpedaled a bit, his breath speeding up. The Seer, Luna Lovegood began chanting the prophecy. He simply stared at Voldemort, his orbs glowing a bright Avada Kedavra Green, his Raven locks flowing in the newly made, magical wind and with a simple whimper, Draco had burst from the crowd, screaming about how Harry was just a half-blood. And Harry, simply responded, "No, u."

The magical shockwave, First disintegrated Voldemort, who only managed out a whimper, before he was turned into a shadow. Malfoy was blown backwards, simultaneously dying and losing his marriage contract with Astoria Greengrass, who promptly started forming a soul bond with Harry. All across the world, people dropped dead, each and every one of them, marked death eaters.

On that faithful day, All of Dumbledore's work was reversed. The genocide of the German people, the Rawandan genocide, the assassination of JFK. All of these, and more were fixed, and the Weasley family was wiped from time. Finally granting Harry's true destiny. Having a harem, of all the girls in Hogwarts, and having their tits, and asses be huge.
