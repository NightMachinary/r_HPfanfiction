Thank you for the recommendations! I will look them up. Why did they take down "Nightmares of Future Past"?

I'm very new to this whole fan fiction thing! I just started reading fics and now I'm writing so I'm trying to learn all these rules and terms as I go. I'm also brand spanking new to reddit. I didn't even know this site had private messaging.
