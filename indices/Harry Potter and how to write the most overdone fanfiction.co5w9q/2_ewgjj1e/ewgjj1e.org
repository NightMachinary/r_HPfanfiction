You forgot the shopping trip!

One or two full chapters of going through every god damn shop in Diagon Alley, buying a trunk that has a full house inside, the super-duper ultimate wand with a core of a bunch of magical animals, a piece of a god and/or a legendary beast. The bookstore stop going into detail of every book he buys etc.

And talking about books, he finds out in one of his properties the diary/grimoire of Merlin and the founders plus of everyone who has ever been someone in the history of the Wizarding World, and he learns everything in, like, a week.
