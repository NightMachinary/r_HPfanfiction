I just checked, and apparently a godparent is a person who sponsor a child's baptism. They are sometimes also the legal guardian of the child in the event of the death of the parents. However, this requires mentioning in a will made with the assistance of an attorney. Essentially, a godparent is a informal position where as a legal guardian is a formal position recognized by law.
