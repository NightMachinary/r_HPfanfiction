  In addition to this I'm thinking acclimatization is more of a factor in becoming like Dumbledore or Riddle (who both have studied magic more extensively than many other witches and wizards).

I like this mechanic. Study and practice of greater and greater variety of magic results in a deeper and deeper intuitive understanding of and communion with magic, which, in turn, results in superior magical ability. This means that "magical power" is meaningful and different characters have different amounts, but it is a consequence of the character's nonmagical traits and actions, and different personality and actions lead to being attuned to different categories of magic.

  Magical exhaustion is a very realistic limit that is imposed in most fanon (not sure about canon).

It never comes up in canon unambiguously, that I know of.

  I don't subscribe to the notion that people have an affinity for occlumency however, it just seems to me to be based around mental discipline and fortitude.
#+end_quote

I think that Rowling kind of fumbled this one. Harry can't learn Occlumency because he wears his heart on his sleeve, but Snape, in his rant about people who could never learn it basically describes himself, while Draco, who's never done a subtle thing in his life (well, maybe, once, in his first year, with the "duel"), picks it up in two months so well that Snape couldn't get past it.

  Magical cores are really crude. It sort of reminds me of how people think massive, hulking bodybuilders are the epitome of strength, yet a 120lb, 6'4" man from Ethiopia can run 80 kilometers in a day. Both are impressive in their own right.

Indeed. If "magical power" is a thing, it's definitely not one-dimensional.
