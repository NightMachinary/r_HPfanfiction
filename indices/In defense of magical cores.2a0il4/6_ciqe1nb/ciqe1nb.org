  And limits are necessary... it's surely possible to do something "game-breaking"

Yes - and if you were adapting Harry Potter to a game, you clearly would need some sort of limit, either cores or something else.

But it's not a game - it's a story, it's a book. The real problem with magical cores is that they make magic boring, they simplify it. Harry is powerful because his core is very big - boring. Harry is good at a specific spell because he practised it for ages or has some sort of empathetic connection or deeper understanding of the intent and/or logic of certain spells - more interesting, more varied.

There are stories where the 'core' is somehow made complex and interesting - but they certainly seem to come across as a lazy crutch in a lot of story telling. And frankly it seems like getting worked up about 'game-breaking' in Harry Potter is a bit of a waste of time - the cannon is full of various game-breaking mechanisms.
