I like to think that casting a spell is like being good at basketball. There's talent necessary to be great at it. There are physical limitations. There's skill. There is practice. There's luck, intelligence, state of mind, confidence, and a trillion other small details that each are relevant, and make many people have many different styles, be incomparable to one another.

But in the end, it all comes to throwing the ball through a hoop, and the true greats, through a combination of all the different elements required, can differentiate themselves. Naturally, every one of them is a freak of nature, looking like they were created for this one action in mind with every inch of their body, how they move, how they think... everything about them just screams "this guy is inhumanly good".

So Harry may have not been extraordinarily powerful like Voldemort was, nor as skilled, and needed the Elder Wand to level the playing field, but in the end, what he did have was sheer force of will and quick reflexes. Just like Larry Bird wasn't particularly athletic, fast or strong, but through sheer determination and with a smooth shot is now a legend.

There's no need to oversimplify with magical cores. There's no need to limit it to one parameter.
