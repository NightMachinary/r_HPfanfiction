I think that the best comparison is physical fitness.\\
Someone who is out of shape and never exercises can't run very far or punch very hard or if they have small muscles like small children do, then they also cannot perform great feats of physical prowess (with perhaps a very few exceptions of those with the best genealogical luck). With time and exercise peoples ability to perform magic "grows" and if they have a good aptitude to begin with, like Dumbledore or Tom Riddle, they will excel and with physical/magical training you learn to make your stamina and strength do more with less; but those who lost in the gene lottery, like the Hogwarts caretaker (can't remember his name right now) don't have a good chance. One could say, with this comparison in mind, that squibs have a sort of birth defect.\\
Whenever story authors start talking about "magical cores" it makes characters sound like submarines, robots or computers with subsystems and it totally removes my suspension of disbelieve from the story; makes me feel that I'm just assessing a D&D character sheet.
