Well think about this, you have a violin core, in some sense. You have a natural propensity to ability of violin playing. Magical cores would just mean how much magic someone has to pull on in x amount of time. Okay you have more raw magical energy than someone else, does that make you better? No. You just have more to draw on. The wizard with 100+ years on your or the forbidden knowledge of Salazar slytherin at their disposal is going to kick your ass all day long.
