The problem with magical cores that it is often nothing more then an excuse for the edgy protagonist to be more powerful than other characters without actually working for it.

Every time I read a story where Harry has a magical core over 9000 and is thus much more magical then voldyshorts or dumbles I die a little inside.

Besides, I like how in the books that magic is more akin to a skill like playing the piano or the violin. Dumbledore and Voldemort are the most powerful because they are brilliant, hardworking, and thus incredibly skilled in magic. Not because their magical cores are huge or something like that.
