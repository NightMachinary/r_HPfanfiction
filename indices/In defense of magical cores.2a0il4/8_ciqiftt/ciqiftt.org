I find most explanations of how magic works somewhat disappointing. In both the case of skill-systems and core-systems I find they're used as brief 'explanations' for specific events and then forgotten about or sometimes contradicted later on in the story.

In terms of what is or isn't necessary as limitations or to avoid 'game-breaking' effects, I don't think it's really necessary at all. Canon already includes a whole range of possibly game-breaking effects (time travel, functional immortality, conservation of energy violations aplenty) and so I honestly don't mind when an author decides they want one of the characters to do something crazy.

What I'd really like to see somewhere is an author committing to a system and then finding interesting ways to integrate that system into the story so that it feels like more than just an arbitrary restriction/explanation and more like part of the world that the characters have to live with.
