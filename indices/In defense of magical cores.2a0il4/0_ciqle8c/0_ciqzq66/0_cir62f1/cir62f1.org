Wands are aware, to some extent. They are said to pick their users, switch to the winner in some contests (not just the Elder wand, but all of them), and they have different abilities and strengths. Makes sense that magic in general would be aware as well.

Might also be that Muggle-born aren't so much stealing magic (as the pure-bloods claim book seven) but are growing numerically and are culturally simply not reminding magic how to cast certain older (and Darker) spells, so those spells weaken and "die out".
