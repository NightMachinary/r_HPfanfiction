In the magical system for the fic I'll probably never finish I combine a few of the usual forms of magical limitation. Magic is practice/skilled-based /and/ dependent on the caster's physical endurance /and/ intent-based /and/ belief-based. They all factor into how successful an attempt at spellcasting is, in a way.

The primary limitations are intent and endurance. Magic is directly tied to what the caster can endure where x calories are burned to accomplish y amount of work. It's intent-based such that the only limit to what can be accomplished within the bounds of the amount of energy a witch or wizard has to expend is their focus and imagination. Free-form spellcasting requires the caster to hold a nearly perfect mental model of the desired effect along with a complete resolve to bend reality to your will, which is nearly impossible for all but the simplest effects.

This is where the other form of casting comes in, with sufficient repetition and faith that waving a stick around will cause the feather to float, it will. The brain, magic, soul, or whatever takes over and associates a set of actions with a desired outcome. It's like magical muscle memory, and it's obviously much easier to teach to schoolchildren than constructing a mental model, especially when it comes to things like transfiguration.

I'm toying with the idea of Magic being a semi-sentient, pervasive /thing/ that has a memory of sorts as a way of explaining why there are canonical incantations, wand movements and such. The person who invents a spell has to do it the hard way, with intent and willpower, but then through repetition they can teach magic itself to associate a set of actions with that effect. If I use this, the canonical type of spellcasting, with incantations and wand movements, will be dependent on a harmony between Magic's memory of that spell and the witch or wizard's precision and belief.

I've, uh, put a lot of thought into how to create a consistent magical system with sane limits that's still /magical/.

And now I have this idea of the Weasley twins inventing spells with outlandish effects based on the mispronunciation of common spells. Hmm.
