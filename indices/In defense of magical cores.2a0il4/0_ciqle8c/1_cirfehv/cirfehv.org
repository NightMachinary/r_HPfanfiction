I just wanted to post Sanderson's laws of magic, because I feel they're fairly well thought out and a good guideline to fiction writing with a magic system:

1. An author's ability to solve conflict with magic is directly proportional to how well the reader understands said magic.
2. Limitations are more interesting than power
3. Expand on what you have already, before you add something new.
