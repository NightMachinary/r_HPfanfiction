Limits exist in canon. People don't cast spells constantly, even when it would be useful and easy. They use magic as if *not* using magic is far easier, or keeping certain charms up is taxing somehow. There are not "perfectly" done spell effect levels that represent the limits of the spell if done properly -- unless possibly in transfigurations -- as one would expect if spell power was skill-limited.

Emotion seems to matter for some spells, but not enough for kids to be taught emotional control in any class.

Focus matters, but again not enough to be taught as a skill -- or really at all, outside a few specific spells.

This all suggests that knowing the wand motions and incantation at all, for most spells, is both the most important part and the only teachable part of most magic at Hogwarts levels up to year six. Though there is silent casting then, Snape doesn't really suggest any specific training to make /all/ spells work better.

--------------

There are reasons to believe something like willpower or innate magical "umpf" is exhausted in some way by casting successful spells in canon, and that something /like/ a classic magical core is what improves with age. This explains why certain simple-looking spells are taught later in school or not at all, and why magic isn't madly spammed even outside of combat.

As a limited but canon-compliant system, I actually like a sort of magical will. It'll likely end up in my next fanfic. This would be exhausted and recharged like willpower is in real life -- by eating and resting --, is innate but can be tweaked through great strength of character, and is also the primary reason some people succeed in magical professions and others don't. Hell, I might skip the "magical" part and just make it human willpower. You cast too much, you can't even decide what to order at Subway anymore, let alone bend the powers of the universe to your command.

The fanfic I'm writing currently uses a sort of variable recharge rate capacitor system that I called a "core". I outlined what that uniquely meant in my story, but used that name just to avoid having to make up my own term; and then I promptly caught flak from people unable to read past that word. Their loss.

Magical spells sapping physical strength by fatiguing the user is also a classic in RPG systems, but I don't think I've ever seen that one used. This isn't the same as the Naruto-esque "chakra" magical cores that are popular now, with physical and mental power equaling magical power. This would be muscles becoming less able to function as calories are drained from the body with every cast. Sounds like a fun world, where Hermione has to consume massive breakfasts to make it though her revisions and exercises for the day. There are fat witches and there are nerd witches, but there are no /fat nerd/ witches.

But regardless of the system, something is needed other than skill and practice for both length and effect of magic, otherwise people like Hermione would never stop casting (even if only to practice or levitate her books), and neither would anyone in a duel.

Instead, even outside the movies, they fight like six-shooter gunfighters: fast, but cautious of their limits. That again implies limits, otherwise even trivial battlefields would be flooded with water, covered in snakes, filled with stone golems, constantly on fire, appear to be upside-down, filled with nearly invisible people /and/ things, immune to external threat and notice from wizards and muggles (Hermione's camping spells, canon), and/or mostly levitating three feet in the air just from high school spells. I guess non-magical fire would be less than useless, as everyone knows the flame-freezing charm, but that doesn't exclude the rest. That is why rational balance is a /must/ if you want to explore magic any more than it is in canon (i.e. not really at all).

--------------

Just like a good author won't have a fat desk cop run the NY Marathon at the head of the pack, a fanfic author should be able to figure out how much is too much when it come to "realistic" use of magic in their stories. If you just want to write a story where magic sits in the background and people smooch or something, that clearly doesn't matter. But if you want to have real combat or contests of magic against magic, you better have an idea how many bullets are in their "guns", or it /will/ simply be seen as unexplained and dramatically unjustified author fiat.

And speaking of guns: some wands themselves are more magically powerful than other wands, both overall at at certain tasks. Canon.

A simple rule from Brandon Sanderson (a popular and published fantasy writer) is that to the extent that magic /solves/ problems, it must first be /explained/ as a logical (if not rational) system. Otherwise, the magic is just swooping in to save the day or doing something the audience had no reason to expect. This breaks the suspension of disbelief a lot compared to simply exploiting a system they already bought into at least a little in the earlier chapters.

--------------

As for "classic" cores specifically: the name itself is clearly pure fanon, along with the word "wards". But the basic effects are also there, as with wards.

Best example is, Harry at 16 has less innate magical power than Dumbledore. A /lot/ less. This is canon. That means something, both for fighting Voldemort and for going undetected to certain charms or enchantments. Dumbledore also makes it sound like Harry has a chance because of his unblemished soul and his ability to love.

#+begin_quote
  "You have flitted into Lord Voldemort's mind without damage to yourself, but he cannot possess you without enduring mortal agony, as he discovered in the Ministry. I do not think he understands why, Harry, but then, he was in such a hurry to mutilate his own soul, he never paused to understand the incomparable power of a soul that is untarnished and whole."
#+end_quote

Both of which give him /power/ according to Dumbledore, power that Voldemort doesn't have. That doesn't read as metaphorical, either, but that those feature directly into Harry's ability to fight against Voldemort magically. This is pure opinion, obviously, but it is compelling to me. That it didn't exactly come down to a magic-off (and what a let-down that was) seems beside the point based on what Dumbledore says in books five and six.

This points to there being power, it mattering, and Voldemort missing out by not loving and having a soul shattered and corrupted by murder.

--------------

Some more book quotes.

Dumbledore on why Voldemort is tough to kill even with his Horcruxes gone. Hint: it isn't /just/ his skill or knowledge. You will need uncommon power to killed a wizard like Voldemort. Not "powers", like the usual love protections idea. But magical power /itself/. Not that that ultimately matters in canon (sigh):

#+begin_quote
  "Never forget, though, that while his soul may be damaged beyond repair, his brain and his magical powers remain intact. It will take uncommon skill and power to kill a wizard like Voldemort even without his Horcruxes."
#+end_quote

Kids have less of some sort of juice:

#+begin_quote
  "Voldemort will not have cared about the weight, but about the amount of magical power that crossed his lake."

  ...

  "I do not think you will count, Harry: You are underaged and un-qualified. Voldemort would never have expected a sixteen-year-old to reach this place: I think it unlikely that your powers will register compared to mine."
#+end_quote

*tl;dr magical power exists, calling it a "core" seems a small step; there is no link between magical power and spells in canon, but it seems to matter in how dangerous Voldemort is; kids are pathetic magic-power-wise compared to adults, even Harry.*
