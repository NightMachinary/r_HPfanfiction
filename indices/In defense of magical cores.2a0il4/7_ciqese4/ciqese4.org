The third-year Patronus incident would definitely put Harry in the "powerful" category. How did he get so powerful? Skills? He didn't /practice/ the Patronus, he /struggled/ with it, and he failed, and failed, and failed.

Then suddenly, he farts off the biggest Patronus of the century.

"Mana" (magical core) explains it, "skills" doesn't.
