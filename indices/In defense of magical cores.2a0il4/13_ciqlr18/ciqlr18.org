Wands have magical cores in them. People don't (unless it's a /really/ weird slash fic, and even then, only temporarily (I hope)).

However, I can see the appeal of a "magical battery" mechanic --- under any name --- in that it makes Potterverse magic work in an intuitive and familiar way: most resources that we have to deal with in real life, from money to electricity to ATP, have limits on the amount of them available for immediate use, on the rate at which they can be used, on the rate at which they can be replenished, etc.. It's not /quite/ how magic appears to work in the Potterverse, since you'd think that with all the emphasis on DADA (owing to the point-of-view character's interests) and adventuring, /someone/ would have run out of magic or mentioned running out of magic as an issue, but the Potterverse picture isn't all that coherent, so writing a coherent story where mechanics are important requires coherent mechanics.

That said, I don't think I've seen /one/ fanfic that was improved by invoking magical cores (or, more generally, inborn magical power differences between characters) in a plot-relevant way, and I've seen scores that were degraded by it or where this fanon was used to facilitate crappy storylines. There is a handful of fanfics that use magical cores that are good, but most of those could have done without it.

So, my sense is the following, and please forgive the presumption:

1. If you feel like writing a fanfic, and the premise involves magical cores (or, more generally, inborn magical power differences between characters), ask yourself, "Is this element necessary for the storyline?"

2. If the answer to (1) is "no", write the story without magical cores. If the answer is "yes", ask yourself, "Is this a good premise/storyline in the first place?"

3. If the answer is "no", come up with a better premise/storyline. If the answer is "yes", well, I can't stop you, but your odds of ending up with something good aren't good.

Of course, there are exceptions to every rule. For example, if it's your protagonist who has a "weak" magical core and has to work around that in dealing with others who are more magically powerful, coming out on top through hard work and guile, I wish you the best of luck.

One more thing... There are many mundane factors that can result in different characters having different magical capabilities and outcomes: physical and mental health, general athleticism and intelligence, a nurturing and stimulating childhood environment, willpower, even moral values. These are, in some sense, just as unearned and arbitrary as "magical core size", but they don't /feel/ that way, and, unlike the more arbitrary "magical power", they integrate with the character's other traits, personality, and decisions.
