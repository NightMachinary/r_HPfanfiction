I feel like that Fleur being a bitch is mostly fanon. We don't even actually see her, specifically, being rude and disdainful at Hogwarts during the tournament. I think that's just Ginny and Molly being their usual, judgmental selves and projecting onto Fleur. All we really see is a young woman, confident in her abilities, and who is fiercely loyal to and protective of her loved ones.
