Well, she calls him a little boy!

There's also the thing that she never cleans up her English - I mean I myself am not a native speaker but I am quite proud of not having much of an accent (if anything my accent is American - too much US-Television, especially Stargate and Star Trek and other TV-Series!) - which comes accross as bitchy ("I don't need better English, I am French and beautifull...now lick my boots!")

If she could at least back it up, but in the Tournamet Fleur isn't super great...Cedric is better than her and so is Harry, despite his age/education disadvantage!
