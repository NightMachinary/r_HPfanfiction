Oh for sure about it being about Bill, but her being strange and foreign couldn't have helped. Also, Molly is canonically quick to judge (and harshly) and then never apologizing when she's proved to wrong. Honestly, I forgive Hermione and Ginny for being judge-y because they're legit teenagers and I mean they have to endure their crushes going all moon-eyed whenever she's around. Them being a little salty is, while kindachildish, makes sense at least since they're literally kids. Molly has a history of being rude and dismissive of literal teenagers from crap she reads on witch freaking weekly and Rita Skeeter tripe (who she /knows/ is a cancer, but she believed it anyway) I like Molly for her willingness to bring in Harry as her own, but she's super annoying as well :/
