Don't get me started on Molly...there are only a few HP-Characters I like less...seriously, doesn't work despite her family having money problems (even after Ginny left the house for Hogwarts!), thinks she's the world's parent of the millenium (the opinions of others don't count, she is always right...kind of like a dumb version of Hermione who focused on being a rabbit rather than become Minister for Magic!), thinks everybody is her workforce (why was it the kid's job to help her clean up Grimmauld-Place? Do it yourself Molly, you have magic, while you don't allow the kids to use it, despite the house being warded!), she hampers her kids education (they could do magic at home, because the trace doesn't work when adult wizards live at a place, as well!) etc. etc.
