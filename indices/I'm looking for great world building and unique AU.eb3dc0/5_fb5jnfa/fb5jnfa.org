This whole series (7 "books", all found on the author's profile). Features custom magic (it's cool as shit) and the first book is all about revealing wizarding society to muggles. Honestly, just check it out. I'm shit at summaries and recommendations, and this fic doesn't deserve being skipped because of my less than great review.

Oh and, this fic has some of the best OCs, imo.
