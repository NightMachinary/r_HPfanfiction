linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5121464/chapters/11782190]]) is a series that has a lot of neat stuff when it comes to things like religion and customs of the wizarding world. The first fic is pre-hogwarts, but once you get there in the second fic and on, the world building is fantastic.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14760663/chapters/34132413]]) really develops what pureblood families look like from the inside and what harm magic can do when it comes to abuse. Actually the whole series it's in, [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/809346][leave no stone unturned (a series of standalones)]], has some great fleshing out of things like boggarts, magical potions, and more.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17848691]]) and linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3836023]]) both have great historical world building.
