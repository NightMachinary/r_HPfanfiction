Okay so this isn't a Fleur bullying Harry fic, but more of a Fleur trying to find out Harry's secret and the two eventually becoming somewhat friends. Though Fleur here is a rude and coarse manner to her. I am not sure if this is what apparently a lot of people want but I thought it was at least a starting point.
