There's eventual Draco redemption in the linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) series, but book 1 is half a million words and only has the setup for it as a background thread; not much actually happens with Draco until book two. That said, I highly recommend the series, just be prepared for a long read.

The way it occurs is both believable and disturbing, though. I won't spoil it, but let's just say it's a lot more complicated than Draco simply deciding that Harry's a good guy and muggle-born wizards and witches are the same as everyone else.
