I pretty much can't read anything that isn't of technical quality. It's just too hard to follow when somebody doesn't even know the basic forms of spelling and grammar.

I've read some mightily bad stories, however. Mostly they tend to be pairing fics and only then as a curiosity to see where it goes.
