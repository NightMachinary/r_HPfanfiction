Yes, because the good writer stopped. It's on the top of the pages, I wonder why many people didn't notice it's been essentially taken over by a bad writer after chapter 16 (IIRC).

It's like what if you told random guy from the street to continue Harry potter from book 3 onward. You wouldn't be like "wow it got really bad", you'd be like "wow I fucking wish this story was finished", right?

Delenda est just never got finished.
