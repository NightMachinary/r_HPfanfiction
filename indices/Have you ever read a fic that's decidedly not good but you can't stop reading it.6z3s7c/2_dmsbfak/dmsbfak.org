Tons of times, usually because I'm bored.

Kaleidescope of Magic linkffn(9109451) starts off terribly, the dialogue and characterization is complete shit throughout, his grammar is questionable at best, but the worldbuilding is pretty awesome, since he merged Dresden Files and Harry Potter together with aspects of Naruto, namely Sharingan and Mokuton.

Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches linkffn(11574569) is dumb as fuck but entertaining at the very least, which is the best compliment that I can give a harem fic.

Prince of Slytherin linkffn(11191235) is terrible for the first 20 chapters but I plowed through it anyways. Year two is some of the best fanfiction I've ever read.
