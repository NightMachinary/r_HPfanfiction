I found the names to be cheesy, entertaining if you don't think about them too deeply. That isn't necessarily bad in itself, you just have to like some cheese in your stories (but I can see how it can bother some people).

It's really on par with stuff like “Luscious Malfoy” and “Roonil Wazlib”, and I had a laugh at those too.
