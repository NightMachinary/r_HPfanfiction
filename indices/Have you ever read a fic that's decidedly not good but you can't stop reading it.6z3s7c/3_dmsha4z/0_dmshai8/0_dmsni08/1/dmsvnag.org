It's not really edgy as much as it has some stuff affecting Harry that isn't really explained until way later. That in itself is not a problem because you would presume that whoever reads it has knowledge of all the franchises involved and thus the basic idea what is going on, but as [[/u/yarglethatblargle][u/yarglethatblargle]] wrote it's kind of a crossover with a franchise that doesn't exist so you are left in the dark and if you don't get pulled in by the style the lack of knowledge of what the heck is going on can be really grating.
