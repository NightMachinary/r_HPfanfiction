"The Brightest Witch of Her Age" by chocolateberrycake.

The story is riddled with so many spelling and grammar mistakes, while Hermione is portrayed as a huge Mary Sue, with even the professors pawing over her greatness. Yet, for some reason I can't explain, I read it until the end; I even knew the story was unfinished by still made it to the "end" anyway.
