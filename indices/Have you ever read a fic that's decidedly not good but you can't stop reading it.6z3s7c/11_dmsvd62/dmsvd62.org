I used to dismiss Modern AU as crappy fics

Why would you want to read about Naruto in the real world without ninja powers?!

well, I read this one cringy fic but the author had some really good lines and his dialogue was interesting, and the comedy was decent.

so I started reading these kinds of fics then discovered that about 50% of fics in my language is Modern AU or adaptation of some shojo manga/K-drama. I've found some real gems there and some inspiration for my own writing
