Neville's parents are cured and fully functional, and they love him. Only, their outlook is quite similar to Augusta Longbottom's and Uncle Algie and everyone else, and they love their son and are terribly disappointed in him, and want him to man up. Cue Frank constantly deriding Neville's ability and talent with Herbology and plants, and Alice agreeing with Augusta that Charms is a "soft-option" (HBP, I think). Frank buying Neville a new wand, but only because he doesn't think that his son is good enough to wield the wand he wielded. Alice being unhappy with Neville's lack of confidence, and deciding that it is a personality trait which she finds unappealing in her son.
