This is so unsettling. I wonder how they'll be able to stop the mirror? I bet trying to smash it would curse you and your family for at least 1000 years. Not to mention, tracking it down would be a pain. Would everyone have to work together to try and hunt it down, or would they have to fight each other, while trying to track down the mirror? I wonder if some of the people would be against stopping the mirror, because that means that their deepest desire would be gone? Would Harry still want his parents? This is such a fantastic idea.
