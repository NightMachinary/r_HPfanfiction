I thought that the character development of Voldemort was quite well-done, but the Princess (it's been a while I don't remember her name) was quite one dimensional.

Maybe I'm oblivious, but I did not expect the love plot between them, and her willingness to give up the Crown seemed out of character.

There also wasn't much of a plot, it just seemed like events strung together with a certain cast and settings. There was no leadup to the ending in my opinion. What do you guys think?
