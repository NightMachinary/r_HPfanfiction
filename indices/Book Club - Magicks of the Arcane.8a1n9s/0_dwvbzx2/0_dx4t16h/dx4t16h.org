I tend to agree. The love plot seemed barely foreshadowed, but not much more than an oddball friendship and while we knew he would get the crown one way or another, that felt like a weird way to do it. Like, if the princess can't commit violence without losing her purity, how was the crown safe for so many generations? If she can only teach one apprentice, why wouldn't she have nipped his learning in the bud before it go to that point?

Throughout the story, it was obvious that Voldemort was outmatched and it would have been nicer if an ending actually included that matching a bit more, rather than just have her roll over.

As you say, with a bit more characterization, maybe her ennui with her roll, or her disgust in her position as a slave, or her lack of desire to perpetuate a currently corrupt system may have come through a bit more, but as it was, the reader is left assuming some of those things, or worse, seeing a character be handed the idiot ball so Voldemort can win.
