I like the idea that the prophecy is about the outcome of tabletop RPG campaign, and as tabletop gaming becomes more popular, fewer and fewer prophecies are meaningful. I don't remember ever seeing a fic that does that, though.

Edit: Also, the idea that any prophecy that doesn't name /specific/ people could be about anyone, fictional or real, and that with sufficient knowledge and effort, it's possible to construct scenarios that allow prophecies to be fulfilled in a controlled, non-harmful manner.
