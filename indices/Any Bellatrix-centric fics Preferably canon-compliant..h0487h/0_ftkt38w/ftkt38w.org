This is completely cannon compliant, about the, uh...”love story” between Bellatrix and Rodolphus Lestrange. Basically, Rodolphus is completely in love with Bellatrix starting from their school days, but she is troubled and oblivious. It follows their life together as Voldemort rises and Bellatrix becomes increasingly devoted to the cause.

Characterizations are super realistic to canon. This story will likely tear out your heart, run it through a wringer, and hang it out to dry.

If you're okay with something completely non-canon, here is one about Bellatrix traveling back in time, meeting a young Tom Riddle, and the story path their relationship takes. I liked her characterization in this story as well.
