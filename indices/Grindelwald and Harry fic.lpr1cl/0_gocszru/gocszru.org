there is a fic called The Black Heir by FirePhoenix8, and Vindico Atrium on FFN where Grindelwald turns out to be Harry's Grandfather. The series is over 1.5 million words tho so it's not the main point but it is a very interesting read and the relationship between grindelwald and harry is very interesting!
