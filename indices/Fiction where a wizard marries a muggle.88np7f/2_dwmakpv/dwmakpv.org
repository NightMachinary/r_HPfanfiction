Apparently, Percy Weasley marries some girl named Audrey. It's a reasonably popular idea to make her a muggle girl. Here's a couple with that idea. Linkffn(7586229) Largely takes place during the seventh book. Linkffn(12373273) Companion piece to another story but I read it without reading the original story fine.
