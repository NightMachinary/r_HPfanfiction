I agree.\\
You could indeed make a good drama out of a harem story but it would have to be a story /about/ a harem rather than a story /featuring/ a harem. It would have to be the core of your story.\\
Of course, why bother with a harem when simply having a group of friends would allow you to achieve pretty much the same result?
