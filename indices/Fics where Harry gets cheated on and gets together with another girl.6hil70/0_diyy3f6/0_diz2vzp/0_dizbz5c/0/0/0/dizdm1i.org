The only way you could write a good harem story is from the perspective of a harem member. At that point there are options to focus on intra-harem competition, intrigue, politics, relationships and drama (especially if there's serious internal conflict). Of course, nobody's ever going to write a story like that because anyone capable of writing an interesting take on that approach won't touch the 'harem fanfic' section of HPfanfic with a ten-foot pole, but there's a theoretical capacity for a good harem story.

A story having a harem is a red flag for not just the harem itself, which is universally awful, but also that the writer has prioritised wish fulfilment and the rest of the fic is also likely to be shit.
