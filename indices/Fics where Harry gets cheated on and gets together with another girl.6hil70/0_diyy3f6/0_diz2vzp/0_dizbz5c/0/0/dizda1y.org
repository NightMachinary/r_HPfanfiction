I've never understood this fascination for harems. Not only is it a bad idea all by itself, harems being extremely tough to live in, or so I've been told, and get everybody unhappy, but it also weakens your story by having too many characters with the same function.

Besides, Harry, with his strong family values, would never go for the harem option, imho.

I tend to avoid fics that have more than 2 people listed in the main pairing. Especially if this pairing happens to be the dreadful Harry/Hermione/Luna.
