It's a fairly significant part of the backstory in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10728064/1/Days-to-Come][*Days to Come*]] linkffn(10728064). The backstory, and the reasoning why, are fairly tragic in their own way with plenty of blame to pass around for the cheating.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4079609/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Marriage-Contracts][*Harry Potter and the Marriage Contracts*]] by Clell65619 linkffn(4079609) is a bit more vindictive. It's...not the world's best story, but the author did clean it up a bit in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5835213/1/The-Marriage-Contracts-Redux][*a rewrite that's not as vindictive towards Ginny.*]] linkffn(5835213). The rewrite got rid of the cheating aspect though. Instead it's a standard "Harry is betrayed by everyone he knew" story.
