A very Slytherin Harry by geoffaree

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/737220]]

Aged 8, Harry finds out he can talk to snakes. He then runs into a magical snake, learns about being a wizard and keeps a magical snake baby as a pet. He gets determined to be able to provide for the snake when he grows up and decides to learn more about magic.

Sounds very cliche for one of those "super-power" Harry-stories, but he is not. He is very much a typical kid doing stupid kid things who messes up big time more than once.
