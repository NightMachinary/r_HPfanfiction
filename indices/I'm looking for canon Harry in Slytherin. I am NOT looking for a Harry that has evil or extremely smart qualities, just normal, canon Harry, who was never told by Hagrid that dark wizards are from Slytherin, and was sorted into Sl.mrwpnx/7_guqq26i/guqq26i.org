Maybe someone knows which fic I'm talking about: Sirius and Remus raise Harry and it goes through all the years not sure when it ends but there is a sequel involving a multiverse which I thought was really good. Harry is a Slytherin and there is a bit of drarry, frantic and parental wolf star at the end of each year, canon compliment. I'm gonna go find it but it's really good in my opinion :))
