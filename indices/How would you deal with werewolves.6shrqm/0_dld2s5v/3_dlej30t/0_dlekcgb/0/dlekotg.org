Precisely. A person is a person, no matter how small, no matter how hairy.

The idea that people should be catalogued by no virtue save their DNA [which given the nature of lycanthropy is our best descriptor] is obscene--and sadly has precedent. Even by the nations that fought the nations that did so.

Given that there's nearly 800,000 fanfics on Fanfiction.net, plus another 100,000 on A03, I'd say it's likely.

More important is whether or not it's been done well.
