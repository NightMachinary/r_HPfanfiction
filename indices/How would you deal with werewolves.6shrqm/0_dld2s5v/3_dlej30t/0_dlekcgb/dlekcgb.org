More than that, it's not that werewolves are people, it's that people /aren't/ werewolves.

That is to say, while a contagious, dangerous illness like lycanthropy should be subject to disease control tactics (as should other contagious dangerous magical diseases), it should never be allowed to change someone's personal identity, or who they are.

...That would be the gist of an anti-'Greyback Pack' campaign, anyway. I wonder if anyone's written a story where villainous werewolf packs are fought with ideology?
