Honestly, my main method of attack against werewolves would be propaganda, and efficient disease control methods, trying to counteract the beliefs and values that allow werewolf subcultures to form and reintegrate them back into the main community.

If I knew the general vicinity of where werewolf packs were located, I'd use air-dropped leaflets (from brooms, natch) to advertise to them, exposing whatever lies their leaders (e.g. Greyback) told, instructions of opportunities in the wizarding world, advice on where to seek treatment and counselling, the idea that a person with lycanthropy doesn't stop being a person, et-cetera.

To handle people with lycanthropy, I'd sponsor the development of extended branches from St. Mungos and/or other magical hospitals, featuring extensive outpatient services, and quarantine rooms where werewolves can transform without risk of spreading infections. If there are any fortified wizarding buildings available (forts, prisons before Azkaban, etc), they could be refurbished into comfortable and secure facilities for use during the full moon.

Ministry policy wise, I'd...I'm sorry, [[https://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/d/da/DMT_clear.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20111226004639][/why/ does the Department of Magical Transportation emblem look like a biohazard symbol?]]

...Anyway, Ministry policy. I'd probably dissolve the Werewolf Registry and Werewolf Capture Unit; normal werewolves would have their infection in their medical records as usual and be managed by a Center for Infectious Magical Disease Control, which would also manage other contagious magical diseases, while violent werewolves (see; Greyback) would be handled by normal law enforcement or Aurors.

Remember Hermione's homework planner that spoke out loud to remind Harry and Ron about doing their homework? I'd promote some less-irritating 'pocket assistants' in the same vein to people with lycanthropy and/or other contagious diseases, so that they have forewarning about full moons and advice on where to find safe places to transform, or otherwise have access to information to help prevent the spread of their illness. Furthermore, I'd put a bit of financial aid aside, so that at minimum, all magicals with contagious diseases have access to transportation and secure facilities.

...Of course, all this does assume that the general public would be willing to go along with plans to integrate werewolves into the community. It's hard to denounce Greyback's anti-wizard propaganda if he's correct about hatred and violence and not-being-accepted.
