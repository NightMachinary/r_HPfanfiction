Mm, I did come up with an idea a while back...I think I use that phrase a lot.

But yeah, I did come up with an idea that someone would argue for curing lycanthropy on the basis of 'even if we killed all the werewolves now, what's stopping a new strain of lycanthropy returning in the future?' Bonus points if they could present a sample or documented research of a second strain of lycanthropy that's more dangerous than normal.
