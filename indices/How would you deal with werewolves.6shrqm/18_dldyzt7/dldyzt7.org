My general "fanon" overview of Werewolves is:

- supranaturally strong and resilient, to the extent that (up to a level) spells can be shrugged off, this applies to mental attacks against them too.

- virtually immune to other conditions and ailments (the Lycanthopy Curse being intensely aggresive in defending its host)

- on the full moon, they go wild. Wolfsbane effectively makes them comatose.

When I get around to writing 3rd year on my fic, Remus will be changed. Harry will be up close and personal with him and notice elements of Lycanthropy arise every now and then.

I believe that a sufficiently powerful wizard can deal with werewolves easily. That being said, the Wizarding world is very afraid of them; therefore, if you are an unskilled wizard a werewolf will destroy you.

Now for the skilled wizard's techniques:

1. transfiguring or conjuring material around their limbs to immobilise, harden or make the material near-unbreakable.

2. Anti-bubblehead charm. Deprive the werewolf of oxygen.

3. In the same vein as the above, trap the werewolf in water as Dumbledore did Voldemort in The Order of the Phoenix film (Ministry battle sequence)

That we're aware of the werewolf is fairly mindless, therefore should be easy to control, contain, or lure if you plan intelligently and make yourself as little a target as possible (so it doesn't go for you).
