Assuming that there is no chance of a child of werewolves having the disease, create a walled community for weres and provide everything they need for as long as they have not infected any others, and give large monetary rewards for information leading to the arrest or death of rogue wolves. Infecting another accidentally would result in a fine as long as the new were is brought to the gilded prison community, while intentionally infecting or losing the wild were would be punishable by death.
