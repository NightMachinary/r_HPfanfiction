My headcanonned werewolf are spell-resistant a la Hagrid and stronger than a man, but not much more than that. No healing, no super-senses. And none of this applies when they're not transformed, though Greyback's minions (and Greyback himself) were unusually tough and fit as a result of their rough lifestyle in the wild.
