Really depends on what type of fic i want to write and what kind of opposition your facing.

One on one in my basic fic ideas? Fist or weapon fight mono e mono. I like combat fics that have shonen anime levels of fights. Which means yes my version of Harry will be wearing full metal gauntlets and throw a hay-maker into a werewolves jaw.

Large group attacking Hogwarts? Magical chemical warfare. Potions can be very dangerous when mixed and handled incorrectly, string up a minefield of potion mixtures that create toxic gasses and see if mixing wolfs-bane could somehow make it more potent. Or Mandrake bombs.

Large group Canon only magic? Sectumsempra, Lockheart's failed healing spell, Dumbledore's fire wall from the inferni and Voldemort fights, and transfiguration for troops. Halt their progress with the fire and constructs as best you can, vanish their leg bones with the botched healing spell, and put them to an end with sectumsempra.

One on one canon only, blasting spells, sectumsempra, and AK's, no mercy.
