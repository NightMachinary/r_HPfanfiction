I'd hand out guns - with silver bullets :) (or even guns that shoot vials of silver nitrate - like in "Underworld")...shooting is much easier than hitting something with a wand (especially if said thing is charging you!)!

As for untransformed werewolfs? Just deal with them the normal way! (in my case: If it's a deatheater or supporter? AVADA KEDAVRA or SECTUM SEMPRA (or any other lethal spell))
