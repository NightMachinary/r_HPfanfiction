Long corridor + overwhelming firepower.

Super senses don't mean anything if the target wants you to come to them, especially if you'll get funnelled into a kill zone.

Super strength doesn't mean much if you're dead before you reach the enemy.

Super speed doesn't mean anything against if you can't dodge.

Super regeneration doesn't mean much when you're lost 50% of your body mass and can be mopped post-slaughter.

Furthermore, passive traps and tricks that won't be bypassed too greatly by the supernatural weres.
