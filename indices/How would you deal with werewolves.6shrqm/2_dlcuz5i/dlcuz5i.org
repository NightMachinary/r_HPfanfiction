Aside from using the Killing Curse, I'd most likely turn to some form of transfiguration and blasting spells. Wards that act like claymore mines, or even weaponized dog whistles if their hearing is so sensitive.

It really depends on what powers we're working against. If they're just normal wizards and witches that turn into super-wolves once a month, then I'd treat them the same as any ordinary wand-wielder.

You'll have to be a bit more specific as to their supernatural abilities (if any) and weaknesses.
