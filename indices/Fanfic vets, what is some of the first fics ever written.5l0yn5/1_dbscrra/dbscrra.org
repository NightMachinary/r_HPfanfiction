It's been a wild ride. Some fics that I have read are older than current fanfic writers. The scene didn't really explode until the 2004-2006 era IMO, by then we had 5 books and 3 movies worth of material for authors to borrow from and expand upon. Vox Corporis is probably my favorite fic from this era.
