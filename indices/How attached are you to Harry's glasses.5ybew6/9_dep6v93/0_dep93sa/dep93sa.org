He doesn't seem very fond of his celebrity status. Everywhere he goes, people gawk at his scar. I'd have slapped on some muggle makeup to cover it.

The worst use of his scar as identification was in a fanfic where the goblins demanded he show them his scar as proof of identity. No wonder they removed the Philosopher's Stone from Gringotts. Worst security ever!
