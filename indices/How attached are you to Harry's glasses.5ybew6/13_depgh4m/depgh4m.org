I don't really care one way or the other... if the glasses are never addressed I'm usuallly perfectly fine with it (because it's not very interesting). There's nothing really wrong with getting rid of the glasses either, but it can be a red-flag for a stupid fix-it fic and I think that's why some people might be weary of it. I don't know how many fics I've seen where Harry immediately after getting his eyes fixes strolls into Gringots to become a Lord, gets his magical block removed in St. Mungos and discovers a list of his "magical gifts" (or whatever the fuck they call it this time) like "natural occlumens" via a ridiculous blood ritual. Oh also he's an Animagus now.

The fixing of the eyes in itself isn't bad, but it gives a higher likelihood of the fic being trash - at least in my opinion.
