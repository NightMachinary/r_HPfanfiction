The only time I care about the glasses is if they are used in or made into a plot point. I really don't care if Harry goes to a magical eye-doctor in summer of '93 to get his eyes fixed or something, but when he starts becoming an animagus and that fixes his eyesight, or his eyes get better through some random ritual and some quidditch regulation means that he is now forbidden from playing in official matches, that turns it into an actual plot point. Similarly, if he starts enchanting his glasses to act more like Moody's eye, that's cool, too. I just don't really want some big deal made about it when it really doesn't matter except for cosmetics.

One thing I've seen that alternates between bothering me and being kinda cool is when he fixes his eyes or otherwise removes his glasses, and suddenly the female love interest starts waxing poetic about his eyes. Glasses don't mask your eyes that much, and I doubt that Hermione and Ginny have never seen him without them. On the other hand, it does give some tiny explanation for why a random tertiary character suddenly falls in love with him.
