I guess I always thought he would do one of two things: get his eyes fixed (either magically or with laser surgery-he is rich after all), or buy nicer glasses. I've been wearing glasses for 15 years and my prescription changes every 2 years, so he'd need new glasses probably! Also can't imagine them being great for quidditch or aurors, so he'd probably need to do something in either of those jobs
