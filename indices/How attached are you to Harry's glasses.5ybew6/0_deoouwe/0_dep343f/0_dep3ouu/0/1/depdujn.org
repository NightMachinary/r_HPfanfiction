Not everyone likes lenses, I have a few friends with glasses and none of them like lenses. If I had eyesight issues I'd go with glasses as well, because I'd probably accidentally poke my eye out or touch it after eating spicy chicken wings one week in. I mean, I once put toothpaste on a razor when I was still half asleep. Lenses would be a disaster.
