You have to understand that your face, is heavily connected with your soul. It is your identifying feature. You may change your face through the use of Transfiguration, but it takes a lot of time, effort, and an expert on the subject, which is a rarity to find (only about three in Magical Britain). Most wizards just choose to pay fifteen galleons for glasses that never break, and appear back in your hand when you lose them, rather than spending thousands of galleons on transfiguring your face. And people that do change their face successfully, report feeling 'dirty' or 'wrong' this may be a byproduct of interfering with the soul and has caused them to revert back to normal, spending thousands of galleons just to do that, again. That is why people will usually wear glasses instead of getting magical eye surgery.
