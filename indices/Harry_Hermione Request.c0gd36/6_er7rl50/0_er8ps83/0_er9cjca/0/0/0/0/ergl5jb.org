linkffn(5750894) is decent, but short.

I despise a Hermione that's a perfect school veela goddess because I think it ruins the character. I prefer an excessively loyal, ruthless, intelligent, slightly tactless Hermione that's shown in canon, but with character growth. And being Harry's love interest almost always gets rid of any good character growth for her.
