I agree. Hermione definitely had her flaws in canon. She wasn't some sort of super genius. I mean try comparing her to canon Snape and she comes up short. She was jealous a few times in canon. She had no tact. She was a bit narrow-minded.

I actually have nothing against this pairing. I actually think Ginny, Luna, and Hermione could have each conceivably gotten with Harry had circumstances been different. But for it to work would require changes to Hermione, and a more assertive Harry.
