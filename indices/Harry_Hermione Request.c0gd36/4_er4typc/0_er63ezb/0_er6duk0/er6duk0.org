Just take all "Harry (and only he) goes back in time" stories (with the exception of "Harry Potter and the Witch Queen"). Adult Harry renders young Hermione useless. Then take all the "Lord Harry" stories - Hermione usually gets sidelined completely (even outside a harem) while Harry takes centre stage because he inherited so many titles and seats, and an aristocracy is OK if Harry is top dog, right? Then look at the "Indy!Harry" stories, where Harry "breaks free of Dumbledore's control". Many of them have him teach hermione how she can't trust Dumbledore, books and authority, and then drag her along as a minion while he defeatss Dumbledore and Voldemort.
