the first fanfic I remember reading was Starsky & Hutch written by a friend. This same friend started writing a Facts of Life fic (by hand) and a group of us would share the pages as they were written and then a couple of us started contributing. This was BTI (before the internet). I may still have a floppy disk with part of the FoL story on it, typed on a Commodore 64.

I also still have about 20 one inch binders of fanfic from The Sentinel bought from someone online and probably a handful of X Files crossover fics that I printed out right before I killed my AOL account.

(it's been a long strange trip)
