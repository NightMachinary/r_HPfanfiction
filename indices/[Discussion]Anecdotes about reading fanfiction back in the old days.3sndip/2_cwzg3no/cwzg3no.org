Fanfiction has kept me sane /[citation needed]/ from Year 6 and counting. I started off in the Ranma fandom, which was cool, but it was losing traction even back then. My first reading of [[http://www.soulriders.net/brian/archives/zen/bitter.htm][The Bitter End]] left me in tears. Lol.

It didn't even cross my mind that Harry Potter fics were a thing until a couple of years later. Found H/Hr, and stuck with it. I actually got my Mum to print off a good 80k at work so that I could read it on the go. The strange thing is, I can't even remember its name... darn.

We tried writing one among friends at around the same time: one chapter each in a rotation of three. I finish mine, where Harry's angsting about life because Hermione might not like him (this was pre-OoTP, but there's absolutely no excuse). Like all good friends would, the next guy up (let's call him John) opens with the following:

/'It was a grey-as-fuck morning in the Great Hall. Harry sat down to eat beans on toast, but he didn't feel like beans. He grumbled.'/

And on went the rotation.
