I really didn't like HHr back then. Was hardcore DHr, but that petered off into becoming more ship-agnostic. I've read some HHr in the last few years that I liked.

When I introduced my sister to fanfiction, she mainly read HHr. I regretted introducing her to fanfiction though because we ended up fighting over PC time, haha.
