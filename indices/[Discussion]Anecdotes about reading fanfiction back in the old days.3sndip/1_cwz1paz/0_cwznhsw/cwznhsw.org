one-shots were my usual go-to for angst, XD.

I had a bookmark full of sites I used to go to, including mugglenet, schnoogle, hpff. I liked how they had lists for "most favorited, most reviewed" There was also probably a site for every ship under the sun, haha.

I hear you - there was much more room for speculation before the second half of the books came out. I also remember people putting up ship manifestos on LiveJournal, on why A and B belong together and not B & C or D or E.
