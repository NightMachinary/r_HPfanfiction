Back then I read a bunch of one-shots, usually romance. These days I generally don't read anything under 30k words unless it's specifically recommended.

My favorite author (or rather, the only one from back then whose name I can remember) was subversa, and this was back when people actually used mugglenet's fanfiction site and stuff was added daily.

I kinda miss mugglenet's fanfiction site, because back then the side bar was always updated with new stories.

And there were so many ways to end the war, or for it to be fought, no mention of artifacts like horcruxes (I've only come across immortality granting objects completed before DH once!).

I also spent a lot of time reading it in the school library, being careful about which computer I used.
