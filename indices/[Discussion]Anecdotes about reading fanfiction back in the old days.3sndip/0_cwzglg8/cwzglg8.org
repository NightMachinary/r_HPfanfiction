What I really notice these days is how much the quality has shot up in fanfiction. I remember when that old gem Harry Potter and the Psychic Serpent linkffn(288212) was the high watermark of what the fandom produced.\\
Particular to the potter fandom was the glut of divergence fics after GoF with everyone trying to figure out where things would go next during the big wait until OoP, I think very few of us expected Voldemort to remain in the shadows for as long as he did. A lot of stories kicked off with an all out attack on either Privet Drive or The Burrow and not a small number had the masquerade completely dropped by mid way through fifth year.
