I'm too lazy to do the rest of the math but aside from the bus ride these prices (the ones converted) seem fairly reasonable. There's even an argument to be made for the price of the bus ride, people can apparate, floo, take portkeys, or fly and so it seems like the pricing is possible if high to us lowly muggles.

Edit: Also, what could explain the lower cost Hermione pays is a student discount.
