This shouldnt suprise anyone. Before JK said a galleon was 5 quid we all estinated it was 50 quid a galleon with the size of hogwarts class of 91.

Also hermione has 2 dentist parents that own their own firm. Go on yearly vacations each summer. Shes pretty much a spoiled rich girl who likes books more than people because her parents didnt dial it in at home. They dont give a shot about her friends and never offer to help harry ever. Hell hermione would rather date a guy 4 yrs her sr. In bulgaria whos tech a child molester and her parents let her go where ever she wants. Tldr. Her getting a 500 quid bday present is like tossing coin in a well for the granger family
