Exchange rates like that are more set by law, at least in modern times (eg, the penny:dollar ratio doesn't actually depend on the price of the raw materials in the penny). Knuts/Sickles/Galleons seems to mimic the british pence/shilling/pound coinage, or at least the earlier one - which was 12p to the shilling, and 20s to the pound. The WW just made it a bit more weird, number wise ;) (though luckily has fewer coins).

My assumption is that there is some sort of reason to not melt down the coins for their metals - probably anti-tampering charms that are woven in to the creation process making it reliable as coinage in a magical world - though the events from the world cup seem to indicate that faking galleons is possible/not too difficult to pass off.

But I wouldn't mind a fic which took the exchange rate/base raw cost of the materials version you put up in your post and used that, it would give it a nice medieval feel.
