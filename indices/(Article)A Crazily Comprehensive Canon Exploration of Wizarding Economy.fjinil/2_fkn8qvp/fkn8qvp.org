I wonder...Knuts, Sickles and Galleons are literally made from bronze, silver, and gold. And 29, 17, and 493 seem like odd values.

Is it possible that Knuts, Sickles and Galleons are three separate currencies rather than one, with varying exchange rates between them and varying buying power depending on the supply of copper/tin, silver and gold? The exchange rate between Knuts and Galleons might have started off at 493-1, but over the course of the books it could have widened or narrowed.\\
With the second Voldemort war, Nicolas Flamel's death (and the destruction of the gold-making Philosopher's Stone), and ongoing mining activities, the exchange rate and prices on goods could have gone every which way.
