Honestly, the Weasleys are lower-middle class, not poor. Arthur has a government job that is entry level, but seems to pay decently. They have to scrimp a bit because they have such a large family, and they're at risk of overdrawing on their bank account (or the equivalent) at least once. But on the other hand, they always have plenty of food on their table, even enough to take in a guest, and they take at least one holiday without the windfall of the lottery (Arthur, Molly, and Ginny to Romania in Book 1).

In other words, the Weasleys are poor by British boarding school standards, and Ron is poor compared with his two best friends, the daughter of two working professionals and the heir to a successful cosmetics business. But they're probably doing a fair bit better than JKR herself was when she wrote Book 1.
