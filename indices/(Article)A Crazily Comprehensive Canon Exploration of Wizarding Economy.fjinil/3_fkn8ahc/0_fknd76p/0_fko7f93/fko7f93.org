I think 'poor' vs 'lower-middle class' is something that's very hard to pin down - and heavily depends on the point of view of the person claiming it. (For instance in the US, /everyone/ wants to be middle class, so the boundary for 'lower-middle class' is set fairly low in a way).

In the case of the Weasleys, food wise they live in the countryside, and they have their own garden + orchard + chickens for food - so it seems like they grow a lot of their own food, instead of having to buy it.

In terms of purchases, we see that they have to save up a lot - not being able to afford another wand for Ron in book 2, re-using old clothing/school items, etc. They're not destitute by any means, and if they had 1-2 kids instead of 7 it's likely they'd be much more comfortable - but I don't know if that alone is /really/ enough to put them into a well-off category.

Part of what makes it difficult is the very narrow view we get of the WW and its economy - because we don't really have many points of comparison for the Weasleys in terms of wealth. I think a fanfic author can adjust them in whatever direction is appropriate for their story because of that.
