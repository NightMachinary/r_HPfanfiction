Mr Weasley's job isn't entry level at all. Even before he's promoted he's right there in the thick of things and knows everyone. Lucius Malfoy, for example, specifically targets Ginny because of entirely ordinary aspects of Arthur's job. It's disrespected as opposed to insignificant.

The problem with the Weasleys is that the Wizarding World seems to consist of a society where almost everyone works either in the Ministry or in retail. There also appears to be no tax system whatsoever... it's entirely possible Lucius Malfoy funded the entire wizarding government (which explains /so/ much incidentally it's got to be somewhat true).

It's not even clear what exactly a Ministry job means. People like Mr Weasley are simultaneously bureaucrats and legislators... that's /canon/. Hell, often it seems like Arthur goes on the raids himself, which makes him a lot like a cop (Aurors are, after all, termed /Dark Wizard/ catchers).

The Weasleys aren't working class by our standards but nor are they middle class. They own their own home, the father is more white collar than bobby, they have well off relatives, are ingratiated in /the/ upper echelons of informal and formal society (between the Order and Ministry), their children secure what seem to be sought after jobs, the children go to school with the wealthiest members of society, the father has a personal & political rivalry with the wealthiest wizard and they have large durable household goods (the clock and the car fall in here). By our standards they're much more upper class... but of the land rich, income poor variety (beggared by tax and inheritance laws).

Applying "class" to the wizarding world is just not going to yield useful results. The Weasleys are poor is pretty much all that it makes sense to say. The entire system that underpins notions of class IRL just doesn't exist in the dystopic nightmare that is wizarding Britain.

But if we insist on applying class to the Weasleys... they're upper class. And not just because they're purebloods.
