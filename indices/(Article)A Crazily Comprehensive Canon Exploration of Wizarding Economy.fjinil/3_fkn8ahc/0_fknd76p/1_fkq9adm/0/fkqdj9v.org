I never got the feeling that Arthur was a legislator. He wrote a bill that was relevant to his office (a bill that personally hurt Malfoy, at that), but legislators often don't write their own bills, while bureaucrats sometimes do--probably more in a parliamentary system, although I'm not familiar enough with it to be sure.

As for class, well, to start, you have the problem that the British notion of class is not the same as the American one, neither of which are exactly the same as economic status.

Jobs in the magical world would be a whole post in itself. Personally, I don't think it's /that/ different from the muggle world, but let's set that aside. Arthur's job may not be entry level, but it's still pretty low level. He only has one person under him; his office isn't given much space or seemingly funding; he's been passed over for promotions (not that he wants one), and most notably in terms of actual class, as you say, he's not respected by the elites.

I'll grant that the family broadly does pretty well for themselves. Most if not all of them are uncommonly intelligent or talented. You're right that they're cash-poor (something that's more common in rural areas anyway, I think). I didn't quite have that worked out before.

But I wouldn't call the Order the upper echelons, even with Dumbledore leading it. It didn't exist for the first four books (and the Weasleys weren't in the first Order), and when it did, it was a secret society of dissidents, not connected with the social or economic structure of society at large.
