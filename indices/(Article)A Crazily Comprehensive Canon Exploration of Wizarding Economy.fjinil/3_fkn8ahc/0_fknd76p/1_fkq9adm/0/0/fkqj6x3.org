  I never got the feeling that Arthur was a legislator.
#+end_quote

Well, I don't think Wizarding Britain has a legislature. The Wizengamot never does anything other than act as a court in canon... and Dumbledore's presence on it but refusal to be Minister is weird if it is a legislative body.

The important point here is that no-one appears to ask Arthur to prepare his Bill. If that was the case, Lucius would have targeted them instead of Arthur.

  he's not respected by the elites
#+end_quote

Mostly because he doesn't behave like he's meant to. He likes muggles. He doesn't want a promotion. He has a bunch of kids (in an era where few children is the norm... actually, hardly anyone appears to have relatives, especially grandparents). But when events overtake Arthur's own wishes he rises in importance quite a lot... and I think that reflects the amount of respect his department has in terms of its power rather than its social capital. It's a bit like internal revenue... lots of power, no respect.

  it was a secret society of dissidents, not connected with the social or economic structure of society at large.

I think we have to remember that wizarding Britain is a dystopia (not, I think, intentionally but it is very much a dystopia when you look at what we know of it). There's a reason why the Order exists and spends its time infiltrating the Ministry (just like the Death Eaters)... there's no alternative way of doing things (that we meet).

It's pretty obvious that the Death Eaters are a Nazi analogue, but one of the most fundamental things about the NSDAP is that they were a political party. That there is no "official" political arm to Voldemort's cause really makes me think there's no room for it to exist.

I don't, for example, think the Minister is elected in any way shape or form. It seems, to me, to be a process of affirmation; as long as everyone believes the Minister has the support of everyone, the Minister remains in power. And as soon as that support goes? There's no election or any other event that allows the Minister to engage with the public at large. Fudge's actions make so much more sense from this perspective, Scrimgeour's ascension and actions likewise fit in here and, of course, the way that Dumbledore was always having to turn the post down. Shacklebolt's ending up as Minister also fits in here.

Now... it's obviously important that the Weasleys weren't part of the Order the first time (which I ignored before), but Molly's brothers were. I guess that might play into the whole "rich Prewetts and poor Weasleys" dynamic that Muriel's tiara rather implies but direct familial connections to people like Muriel is sort of another line of evidence, now that I think about it.

  the British notion of class is not the same as the American one, neither of which are exactly the same as economic status.
#+end_quote

American class is much more closely tied to economic status, I think. Having a double barrelled name is not a class signifier in the States but it is in Britain (e.g. listen to Elton John's All the Young Girls Love Alice). But I think even British class notions break down completely when trying to coerce Harry Potter into them (nebulous though class distinctions are).
