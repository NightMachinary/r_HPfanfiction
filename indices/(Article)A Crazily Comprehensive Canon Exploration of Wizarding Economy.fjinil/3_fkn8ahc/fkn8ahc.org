You are awesome.

But a simple quill for almost 45$, 500$ birthday presents? Ouch.

For that matter Arthur was able to pay that fine and they are considered poor?!

I want to know how the Weasleys manage to spend the entire Lottery money on a trip to Egypt.

Let's assume that a the cost of getting there is equivalent to that of a plane ticket for each person. Also let's assume that they are staying in some hotel and not with Bill.

That makes the round trip cost around 2*7*372(10% more than a wand costs)=5208$

The cost of staying in hotel, meals, entertainment, tours etc for a month would be around 1800$/person. That would be about

1800*7=12600$

So that totals to 17808$ or a little over half of the lottery price. Where did they spend rest of the money which amounts to roughly 340 Galleons go? Were they staying in the magical equivalent 5 star hotels?
