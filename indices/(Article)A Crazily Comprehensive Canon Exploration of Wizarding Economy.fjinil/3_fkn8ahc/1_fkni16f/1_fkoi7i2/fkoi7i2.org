Honestly, the Weasley's being "bad with money" is just pure poor character development. In this case, when we assume that the Weasley's are real people and that they have difficulty organising their money, we are relying on assumptions. This could have been something JKR explored or at least justified. Looking back, any real person would have used that money for their kids and shit, not blown it on a holiday; she only did it so that Sirius could see the newspaper, even though there are so many other, better ways of making that happen... Rant over.
