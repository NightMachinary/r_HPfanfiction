You misunderstand me. Going on an overseas holiday is not a problem - but if, as the books imply/say, they spent basically the entire prize they got on it, that's a problem.

Eg, spending 1/4th of it is fine/normal/reasonable - but 90+% is just bad monetary skills in their financial situation, and that could then be applied to why they're in that situation.
