You don't understand how it works, do you? You're probably one of those privileged little people who goes away to uni and treats it as a temporary holiday into poverty before graduating and being rich (read: being able to save money). All those povo student stereotypes? That's a lot of peoples' entire lives.

Let's look at things more closely... what extravagances do we see the Weasleys engage in? As far as we can tell their only expenses are food and school related. They barely cover these costs. But they also don't seem to have any other expenses (aside, for a time, possibly petrol). We don't see them buying clothes they don't need. We don't see them eating fancy food (and we do know they've got food production on the property). Maybe they blew all their money way back when on their clock, but I doubt it. The impression I get is that it's an heirloom of some description. If they bought it they'd either know it was one of a kind (and Molly implies it isn't) or be able to ask who else has one.

Are we going to start talking about secret gambling problems or other "hidden" expenses? Because, if we aren't, we're back at the same problem... holiday or not?

Also, holidays are massively expensive. Have you done a holiday on a tight budget? As in, "if we buy this, are we going to have enough money when we get back" tight? Or, hmm, we might need this cash for the petrol to get home, tight? Somehow I doubt it.

[[https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ev3dde/most-money-advice-is-worthless][Bad budgeting is an anti-poor myth.]] Not having cash isn't a reason to not act human when you have it. If you don't? You die. Either slowly or quickly.

EDIT: let us also remember Ginny was possessed by Voldemort and almost died just before they go on this holiday.
