Yeah, because it's completely terrible to take children who otherwise never get nice things on an overseas holiday.

Get some perspective.

A windfall isn't going to change your life if you don't have to pay bills, a mortgage/rent, fix durable goods or repair broken things. The Weasleys face none of these problems and appear to live in a society that doesn't have interest, let alone notable investment options.

That lottery could only be spent. And while you might say "but they could have spent it on new robes". That shit's really not at all important or meaningful. The money did not have the capacity to change their lives because as far as we can tell the only time they struggled was for seasonal purchases in a family where those expenses had /already/ maxed out (i.e. Percy's final year).

Unless you're honestly going to sit there and say second hand stuff is so awful it's better than visiting a brother you haven't seen in years? Second hand stuff is not that bad.

The last money related problem we encounter is Ron's Dress Robes. That's a bit like buying an insurance policy specifically to cover being struck by lightning whilst fishing wearing a tutu.

For a real family, it's silly. There's a reason why poor families don't go on overseas holidays, there is always something more important. But for a family that can magic away most of the issues associated with money and which faces an expected decrease in expenses? Nope. It's an entirely sensible decision... unless someone is averse to second hand goods (and as far as we can tell, it's only Ron that is).
