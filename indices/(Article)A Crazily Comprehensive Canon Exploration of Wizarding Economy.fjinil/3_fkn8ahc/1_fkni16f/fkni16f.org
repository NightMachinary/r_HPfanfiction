Being able to scrounge up $2500 for a fine doesn't mean you aren't still poor - it could have been all or most of their savings, for instance, or they could have gotten help. Their vault at the start of CoS had 1 Galleon and 58 Sickles - $217 by the OP's numbers.

What appears to be the case, in my opinion, is that they're poor because they have so many children. Arthur's salary - plus their inheritance, like the Burrow + its land - would probably be easily able to provide for 2 kids. But with so many, and at least /some/ decent chunk of their cash wasted on fines and side projects, they have to re-use a bunch of stuff for the younger kids.

The fact that they splurged on the trip after winning the jackpot is a sign that they really aren't great with money - so that probably plays some role in it too. But I think even despite that they'd clearly not be well off.

For the trip, I assume the costs would have been higher (travel wise) in the 90s compared to today - but I think it's likelier that they didn't /really/ spend it all on the trip, JKR just didn't bother itemizing everything. It's certainly possible that costs are higher in the WW for hotels and food and the like, since it's a smaller community with less travel than the muggle world.
