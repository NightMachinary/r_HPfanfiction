  bk2 ch12 para164: Arthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office, was today fined fifty Galleons for bewitching a Muggle car.

  For that matter Arthur was able to pay that fine and they are considered poor?!

This is actually a pretty funny situation. The Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office would be the one in charge of issuing a fine for illegally bewitching a muggle car.

Arthur Weasley is the head of that office.

I.E., Arthur, honorable law-abiding man that he is, seems to have issued himself a fine and paid it.

Now, depending on how the MoM does its accounting, that fine could very well have been collected by the department issuing it rather than the Ministry's general Treasury.

In such a case, Arthur's fine may likely have been directly added to his own department's operating budget. A budget which he has discretion over the use of.

Its entirely possible that Arthur's tiny little department suddenly decided to comp its employees' lunch expenses for a few months or something to that effect after that fortunate windfall of a fine.
