  Arthur was able to pay that fine and they are considered poor?!

  I want to know how the Weasleys manage to spend the entire Lottery money on a trip to Egypt.

They're probably poor bc they squander their money & then have little left over for the things they actually need.

Obviously this veers into headcanon territory but what if they're constantly paying fines for things their kids do, if Mr Weasley is constantly buying muggle junk from.wizarding eBay, if Mrs Weasley's clock was expensive etc. They could well be chronically bad with money and constantly finding themselves caught short after splashing out.
