Killing unicorns is a bad idea. Keeping them and taking advantage of range deaths, natural causes and old age, well, you can charge for rarity value. But - and this is the important part - at no point do you have to risk your life or go anywhere near giant sapient maneating spiders.

As for killing acromantula, sure, but you've got to do it close enough and delicately enough that you don't rupture anything you want to harvest. Since you'd have to pay me a king's ransom to address GIANT SAPIENT MANEATING SPIDERS with anything daintier than massed artillery from at least a kilometre's distance, and another king's ransom not to scour the site with copious incendiaries afterwards to make sure we got all the eggs, we're back to the original problem.
