Aye, true enough. But I still think both prices should be closer to each-other anyway, and very much on the upper echelon of the range (maybe only surpassed by Basilisk venom and other super rare oddities). There is no indication of life-expectancy for unicorns, but I'd wager that's pretty high, and Accromantulas "only" live about 50+ years (and that was Aragog, a specimen cared for by Hagrid throughout its life). That 5 times multiplier doesn't really make sense to me.
