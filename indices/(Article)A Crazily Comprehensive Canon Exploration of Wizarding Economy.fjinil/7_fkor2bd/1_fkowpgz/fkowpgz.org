Yeah, the wand price is definitely one of the less reasonable of the series. Then again, that's a unicorn hair sold as a specialized potion ingredient by Slughorn, who wants to get his money's worth. The price could be a bit lower in other circumstances and if you buy in bulk.

There is also evidence to suggest that Ollivander collects his ingredients himself:

  bk4 ch18 para185: “Ah, now, this is one of mine, isn't it?” said Mr. Ollivander, with much more enthusiasm, as Cedric handed over his wand. “Yes, I remember it well. Containing a single hair from the tail of a particularly fine male unicorn ... must have been seventeen hands; nearly gored me with his horn after I plucked his tail. Twelve and a quarter inches ... ash ... pleasantly springy. It's in fine condition. ... You treat it regularly?”

But that still doesn't make much sense anyway, unless he's really not a all concerned by money and just barely recuperate his costs (and maybe not even that). He'd be a sort of philanthropist wand-maker who just wish for everyone to have a well-suited wand that actually chose them.
