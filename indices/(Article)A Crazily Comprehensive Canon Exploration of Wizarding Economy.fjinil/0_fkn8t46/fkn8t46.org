I think this is just another point to add to the 'looking for consistency in the Harry Potter world is a fast path to madness and obsession' tally. Rowling may be able to write a world that feels magical and interesting, but she desperately needed a Continuity Editor to keep the series consistent.

I'd be really interested to see one of these where you do each book individually. See if there's any different in each book as opposed to the overarching series.
