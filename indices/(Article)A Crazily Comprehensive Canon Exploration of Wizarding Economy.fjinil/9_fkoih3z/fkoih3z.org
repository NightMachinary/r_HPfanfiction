A bit of supplementary blather:

Coin and metal ratios:

1 Galleon = 17 Sickles = 493 Knuts [1 Sickle = 29 Knuts] or roughly the purchasing difference of

G = $24.65 | S = $1.45 | K = $.05

20th century floating average of Gold:Silver value by weight (despite being set as 1:15 by Revolution-era US govt) is ~1:47

The historical (like since birth of Christ) Silver:Copper ratio is ~1:110

Assuming the goblins would abide by something near these practical ratios...:\\
.1 oz Au ~= 4.7 oz Ag\\
1.0 oz Ag ~= 110 oz Cu\\
.1 oz Gold ~= 517 oz Cu\\
A single .1 oz Gold Galleon == 17 x .275 oz Silver Sickles == 493 x 1.05 oz Cu/Bronze Knuts

.1 oz Gold Galleons (slightly less than the mass of an old penny) == 17 x .275 oz Silver Sickles (mass roughly like a Susan B Anthony dollar coin) == 493 x 1.05 oz Cu/Bronze Knuts (20% heavier than an Ike silver dollar)

Since a Washington quarter weighs ~.2 oz, those hubcap-sized [more like drink coaster-sized] coins were actually Knuts!

"Err... keep the change."

Or... a 'bronze' Knut is .03 oz silver + .194 oz copper, a substance known as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corinthian_bronze][Corinthian Bronze]]

As we're talking about relative purchasing power, the actual valuable metal content in goblin-made coins may be half of what's represented, the other half counted as anti-forgery charms and craftsmanship. Either that or they run the conversion from muggle cash at twice the metal value. A Galleon may be .1 oz of gold, but it may cost you $80 to buy one in the 90's when gold traded ~ $400/oz.
