I wonder if some of that is down to inflation - over the period of the books being released, inflation accounted for ~30% (ie, £100 in 1997 -> ~£130 in 2007), which could account for part of the difference. Like if she was thinking a galleon was roughly £5 [[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2001/0301-comicrelief-staff.htm][according to this transcript]], that would have cut into the value over time if she was just thinking of what a fiver would buy that year.

But I guess it's most likely that once she decided to have a galleon be ~£5, there wasn't a need to use the smaller coinage - even if the prices don't really make much sense with that rate.
