Good write up! I'd always felt like JK Rowling had basically forgotten about sickles and knuts by the middle of the series and just started using galleons as the base currency with sickles and knuts as vague change even though it didn't fit super well. This gives some interesting clarification.

Book 1: 4/6 references include things other than galleons

Book 2: 1/3

Book 3: 1/4

Book 4: 3/7

Book 5: 3/12

Book 6: 1/10

Book 7: 0/3

So while it's not as bad as I remember, the indication is there that galleons became like pounds and sickles and knuts became like vague pence. Most of the references after book 2 that use sickles or knuts are used to highlight one of two things, exactness on the part of the Weasely twins (their bet with Ludo, their charging of Ron) or the general cheapness of something. If not serving one of those purposes, JK was far more likely to simply go with galleons.

This is most likely due to the movies, which I am pretty sure hardly mention sickles and knuts at all.

I did something similar to this once, though I just went off of the things I could remember rather than searching for every reference. I came up with $50 to the galleon as well, using the daily prophet as a guide rather than a beer.
