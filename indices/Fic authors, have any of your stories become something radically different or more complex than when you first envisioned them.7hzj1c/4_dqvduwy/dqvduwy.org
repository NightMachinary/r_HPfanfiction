I originally envisoned LIke a Red Headed Stepchild as either a one shot or a series of shorts that played up the humor in people confusing Harry for a Weasley. Instead, I ended up with Gilderoy Lockhart as a world traveling monster hunter, Hermione Granger as the Dark Lords bane, Ron as a side kick, and Luna as everyone ones favorite youngest Weasley sister.

I'm not even sure about Why Time Travel is Wrong and Other Morals. I still think SI stories are dumb, even if they are fun to write.
