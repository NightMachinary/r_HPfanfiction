Ah, SIrius. He was probably my second favorite character, after Gilderoy Lockhart of course. I remember in Seventh Horcrux he ended up as a Death Eater because Voldemort was insane, but the idea never really went anywhere. So I decided that when he met Voldequirrell, his reaction to "are you a Death Eater" was going to be "Sure, why not." Of course, that ended with Voldemort falling in love with him (which is possibly the worst thing to ever happen to Sirius in any story ever). I may have to revisit Red Head someday, because there is a story arc I have planned that would finally throw the old dog a bone.
