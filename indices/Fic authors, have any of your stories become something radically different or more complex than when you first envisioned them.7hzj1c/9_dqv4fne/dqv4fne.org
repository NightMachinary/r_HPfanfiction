Oh, definitely. My current story was supposed to be about magic simply being addictive, specifically Dark magic. It was going to be light commentary on the opioid epidemic, but now there's a small political plot on wizarding globalization and the main plot is now more about familial matters like child abuse and grief. It's taken up most of my time to research the whole thing. I'm not sure I can even pull it off at this point, But I'm having fun and that's what counts! And to take a break from the more serious plot fic, I'm writing a super light-hearted fic, so I don't get too depressed with the other's serious themes.
