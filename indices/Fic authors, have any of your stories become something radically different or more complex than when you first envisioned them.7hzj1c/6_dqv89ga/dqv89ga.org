I wrote a Harry/Tonks one-shot that had them together at Slughorn's party. I am currently writing a massive AU spinoff.

Another one-shot, this one Harry/Fleur, had dozens of requests (both PM and review) which demanded a second chapter. I started at least 5 drafts but never got anywhere close to the "lightheartedness" of the original.
