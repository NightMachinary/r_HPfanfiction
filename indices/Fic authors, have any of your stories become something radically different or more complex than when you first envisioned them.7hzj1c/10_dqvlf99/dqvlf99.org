I would say this sort of thing is what resulted in my entire Potterverse. I originally started writing a story about two people having a conversation in a car and then a whole lot of begatting happened and now I have 28 works up on AO3. I'm a seat of the pants writer, so I don't really outline and things happen as they go along. I'm working on being a little bit less seat of the pants, but stories gonna story, yanno?
