I was writing a one-shot about a girl who kills a runaway dragon. It was told through a special edition of the Daily Prophet, in which the reporter interviews her friends and professors to understand who this girl is, why she would even think to face a dragon, and how she could win.

In order to make it seem more real, I was writing outlines for what had happened up to that point. As time went on, even minor, off-hand comments actually had a detailed explanation.

There was a point in writing the interview of the Quidditch captain where I had just gone too far. By the time I went back over my notes, I had outlined a sizeable chunk of the protagonist's life.

Now it's a massive project about a modern-day conflict between the muggle and magical worlds, and I am in no way qualified to write it.
