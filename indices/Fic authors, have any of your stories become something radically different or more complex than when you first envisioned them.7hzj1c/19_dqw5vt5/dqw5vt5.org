My fic started as a simple crossover between Harry Potter and Danny Phantom, where HArry is raised by the Fentons. Now, lots of worldbuilding, a handful of OCs, and a reincarnation cycle between Phantom and Plasmius, which Harry throws a spanner in. My outline and notes are 12230 words, and I have even more ideas in my head.
