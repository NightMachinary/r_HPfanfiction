Not for a fic, but for original works, yeah. Realising which of your beloved characters will probably have to die to further the story's key themes and logical actions of other characters can be really tough going! Not to mention then having to build the story around not revealing or telegraphing what will happen to certain characters in the future so the reader still gets invested in and cares about them >_<

It's almost sadomasochistic :O
