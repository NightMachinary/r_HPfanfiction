idk if you care or not, but as a reader, the second the sorting hat says anything other then a house name, I immediately loose all interest in the story. I'm not sure if anyone else feels this way, but I know I like when people tell me little things that make them quit reading so...

but also do whatever you want because it looks good anyway and i'll probably stumble upon it again at some point and read it in a single sitting tbh
