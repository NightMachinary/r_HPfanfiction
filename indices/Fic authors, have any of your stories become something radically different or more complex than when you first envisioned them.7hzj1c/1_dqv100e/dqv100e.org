God yes. My story originally started as something simple, something that didn't go too far from canon but instead focused on smaller interactions. Then I began writing and now, 130k words later, my outline has been altered completely. The outline alone is like 15k words, and if I don't burn out, what was supposed to be end at like 200k words is now going to go above a million words.

I don't regret a thing though. It was fun (and still is) going through my outline and extending the story, having all these small actions snowball into larger consequences.
