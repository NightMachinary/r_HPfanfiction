I feel this in my soul. My outline is currently longer than what I've written because I always finish my outline entirely first, or else I go insane. When I envisioned my fic, it was supposed to be about 100k, but now I can see it going to 300-400k. I'm in for the long haul too, but that's what makes it fun, eh?
