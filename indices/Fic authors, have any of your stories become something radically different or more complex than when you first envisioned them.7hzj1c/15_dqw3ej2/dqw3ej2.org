In the olden days of 2012, when Avengers was still a new thing that no one had ever imagined before, I was a shit writer. I got the idea for a fanfic from a challenge posted on FFN, so you know it was gonna be bad.

I wrote 80k words of prime indy badfic. I nailed just about every trope on the fucking head (with the exception of nice goblins because fuck goblins). I was immensely proud of my edgelord super!Harry.

Then I joined DLP.

What is now my biggest fanfic went through a couple more iterations as I became less shit at writing. I went from a relatively short (by fanfic standards) story to over 250k words of half a dozen subplots and worldbuilding, half of which I came up with on the fly.

It's been a hell of a journey.

I still have that original fic on a flash drive because sometimes I like to torture myself with the memories of how much I used to suck.
