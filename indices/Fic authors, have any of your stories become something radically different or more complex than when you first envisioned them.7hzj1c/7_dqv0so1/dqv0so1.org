I can't really say the story as a whole but more the chapters themselves. I tend to do a basic outline of each chapter before I start writing them yet more often than not, whether it's through the setting or character relations/conversations, the chapter whirlwinds into a radically different set-up than what I initially envisioned for it. In fact, for my story I'm working on, I just posted a chapter where this happened. It's kind of interesting the way this takes place but I tend to like it.
