I've read one. it was still, James and Lily died, but someone discovered that Harry is making weird stuff happen. so they locked him somewhere. (some muggle scientist) it was terrible. like really really dark. he was locked for years, I don't think he could even talk. I believe it was mentor Snape eventually, since he was the one to take charge of him once Harry was found. sorry, don't remember the name. I think it was on ffnet.

I think I found it. it's called my dark protector. but it isn't actually about him being a lab rat, just aftermath.
