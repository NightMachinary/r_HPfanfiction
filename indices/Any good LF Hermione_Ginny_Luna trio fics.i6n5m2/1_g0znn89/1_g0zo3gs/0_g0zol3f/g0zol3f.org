Fair warning, it doesn't happen right away! The beginning is pretty Ginny centric, and then Luna gets tossed into the mix around chapter... 3 or 4? Hermione starts spending time with them around chapter 6-8 I think. Been a while since I wrote it/reread it, the exact details are a bit fuzzy.

I hope you enjoy!
