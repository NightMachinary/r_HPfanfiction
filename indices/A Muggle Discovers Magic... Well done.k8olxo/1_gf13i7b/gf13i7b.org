linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1260679/1/Realizations]]) was mostly focused on Harry moving to Diagon Alley after finding out the Dursleys had moved during the school year to get away from him, but also on a muggle mother with two pre-Hogwarts muggleborn daughters accidentally finding out about and getting adjusted to magic. Including the amusing, if strange, thought that somebody would actually enjoy pumpkin juice enough to buy it in bulk from the Leaky Cauldron.

Unfortunately, the story kind of died at the climax, but what's there is pretty solid.
