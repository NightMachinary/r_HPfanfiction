You know I would like to read a story where the world at large discovers magic and they don't care/ are unimpressed and go on with their lives. Most stories it turns into some great conspiracy where the muggles try to take over or wizards are exterminated or something vise versa.

Muggles find out that they surpassed the average standard of living with technology and let wizards get on with it. Perhaps make a wizarding embassy of some sort but that's it.
