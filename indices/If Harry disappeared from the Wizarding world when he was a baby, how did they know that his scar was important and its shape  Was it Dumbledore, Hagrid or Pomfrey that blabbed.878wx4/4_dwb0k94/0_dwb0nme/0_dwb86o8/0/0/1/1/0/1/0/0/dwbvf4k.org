Maybe since it was during the school year some students found out that Hagrid was going to go to the potters due to Voldemorts fall and spread the news so parents learned of it that way. Also harry arrived the day Vernon was being bothered and it could've been it took hagrid a little while to go to Godric's hallow from Hogwarts due to probably having to take a while by muggle ways such as trains and so on.

Edit: And Snape was there so he could've spread the news as well.
