He was dropped off that same day though, or that night(1st)....though looking back there is no text evidence saying that Hagrid took Harry anywhere else at all, and actually it sounds as if he drove to the Dursleys straight-away which timeline-wise doesn't make much sense. Saying that Harry fell asleep while they were flying over Bristol, and that he got Harry out of the house right before the Muggles started swarming the house. He's talking to Dumbledore as if Dumbledore had not yet seen Harry nor been updated on him.

So I think it's more a canon mistake of timing on Rowlings part than Harry actually having gone /anywhere/ first. Or Hagrid took a very indirect route...
