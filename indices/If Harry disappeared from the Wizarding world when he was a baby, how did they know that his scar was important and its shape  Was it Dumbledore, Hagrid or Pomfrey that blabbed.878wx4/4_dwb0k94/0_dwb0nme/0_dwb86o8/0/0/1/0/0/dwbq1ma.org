I found a solution! If Hagrid takes Harry to Molly Weasley, then not only does it fill in time, but it explains how and why Harry could 'fall asleep over Bristol' on a journey to Surrey of all places. Canon does not support a journey to Hogwarts, because then, why Bristol? It's in the south west, Surrey is in the south east, Hogwarts is waaay up north in Scotland. But Devon is in the south west too.
