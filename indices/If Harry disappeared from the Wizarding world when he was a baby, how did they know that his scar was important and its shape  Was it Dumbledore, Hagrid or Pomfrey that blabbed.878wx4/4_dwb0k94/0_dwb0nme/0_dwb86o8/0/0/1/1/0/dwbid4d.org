Like I said on this thread already, it wasn't the same night because McGonagal spent a whole day watching the Dursleys because she KNEW that Harry was going to be living there, and she complained about stupid wizards breaking the SoS by celebrating the end of the war, meaning, it was the following day. I agree with you about the fact that it seems as if Hagrid flown directly, but that simply isn't possible, because it doesn't take a day to cross that distance, not to mention that a baby needs to eat and would've pooped a lot during that day. So it makes sense for Dumbledore to send Hagrid to Pomfrey, for her to take care of him (she's a nurse/healer after all) while Dumbledore creates his god-be-damned bloodwards without Minerva even knowing. Like I said in other comments... This series has so many plot holes that it isn't even funny.
