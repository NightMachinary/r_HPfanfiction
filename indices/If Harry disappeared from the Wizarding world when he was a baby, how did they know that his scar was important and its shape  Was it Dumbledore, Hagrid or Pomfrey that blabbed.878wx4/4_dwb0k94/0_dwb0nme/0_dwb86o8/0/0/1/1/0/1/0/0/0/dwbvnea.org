Hagrid had the flying motorcycle he borrowed from Sirius.

And even with the students knowing, there was still an attack at night, then celebrations during the day, /then/ Harry is put on the doorstep at night. There's still a day that needs to happen, between Hagrid getting Harry, and Harry being dropped off. Both happen at night, and stuff happens between those things, during the day.
