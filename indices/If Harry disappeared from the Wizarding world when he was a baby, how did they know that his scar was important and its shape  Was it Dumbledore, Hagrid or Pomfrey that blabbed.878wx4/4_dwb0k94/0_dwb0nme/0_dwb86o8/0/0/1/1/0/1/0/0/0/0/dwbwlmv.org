Hagrid got the bike from Sirius when he was leaving Godric's Hallow. I meant he had to take muggle ways to get there in the first place. And Hagrid could've been sent around the next day which could've ben about 3 - 4 hours after it happened depending on when Voldemort broke in. So Snape could've spread that Voldemort fell or students who knew Hagrid was leaving could've spread it that Voldemort died. So there was enough time for them to celebrate in the day and another thing is that since it was later in the year it didn't have to be that early in the day for it to be night out so it could've been 5 o, clock when Harry got left.
