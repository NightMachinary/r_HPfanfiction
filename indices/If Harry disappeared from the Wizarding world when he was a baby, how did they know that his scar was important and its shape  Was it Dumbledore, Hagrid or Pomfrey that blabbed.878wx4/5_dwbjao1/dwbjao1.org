The people we know saw him between him receiving the scar and reentering magical society:

- Dumbledore
- McGonagall
- Hagrid

Snape, Riddle, and Sirius Black are also candidates for having seen the scar.

Hagrid has difficulties keeping secrets, and he had custody of Harry for some amount of time off-screen (possibly as much as a day, since there's about 24 hours between Voldemort's downfall and Harry arriving at the Dursleys). Riddle wasn't in any condition to spread rumors. Snape isn't the sort to indulge in rumor-mongering. Black was seeking revenge too assiduously to spend time telling people about a scar. McGonagall might have told as part of the Hogwarts gossip scene. Dumbledore could have spread the information to build up hype about Harry, but he said he wanted to give Harry a normal childhood, so it would be kind of weird.

There's a tongue-in-cheek fan theory that Hagrid spent that time visiting every magical pub from John o' Groats to Falmouth with Harry in tow. My personal take on it is that Hagrid just wanted a pint, but as soon as he entered a pub and mentioned what happened, everyone was so busy celebrating and making a big deal of Harry that they forgot to get Hagrid his drink. So naturally he went to the next pub over, but he didn't manage to get a drink until after he dropped off Harry.
