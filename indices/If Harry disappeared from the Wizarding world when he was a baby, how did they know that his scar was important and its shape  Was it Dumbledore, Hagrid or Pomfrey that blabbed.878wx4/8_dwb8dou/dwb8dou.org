Probably Dumbledore I imagine....I also imagine there were newspaper articles up the ying-yang reporting what went down. People would want to know.

I'm sure Hagrid spoke of it as well, because why would they keep it a secret? It's the only scratch on Harry for defeating the Dark Lord...what a celebratory headline that would be.
