I don't know if telling Hagrid about the Stone did anything for Quirrel and the Wonder Turban. They were already after the Stone, knew that Dumbledore was friends with Flamel, and that the Stone had just been moved from Gringotts; so when Dumbledore said (all on his own) that something very special was hidden in the Third Floor Corridor, there was little more Hagrid could have said to convince Voldemort to go a'looking.

Either way, on this issue, I fail to see /why/ Dumbledore would want people to know about the Lightning Scar. Blood protection aside, part of the point of keeping Harry with the Dursleys (as stated by Dumbledore himself) is to make sure Harry isn't recognized and swarmed throughout his childhood either by overenthusiastic fans, or by resentful Voldemort sympathizers. Informing the whole world of Harry's distinguishing feature seems counterproductive to keeping him hidden.
