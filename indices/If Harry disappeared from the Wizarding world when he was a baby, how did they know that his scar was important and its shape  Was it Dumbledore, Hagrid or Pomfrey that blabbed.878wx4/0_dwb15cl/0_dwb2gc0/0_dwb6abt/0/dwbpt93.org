Honestly, that gap is the bane of any time-travel fic in which I want to have Harry travel back to the moment he got the scar. And the 'fell asleep over Bristol' on a journey to Surrey from... pretty much anywhere is odd too. Possibly he stopped over in Devon and Molly Weasley looked after Harry for a bit, which sort of makes the journey and the time make sense (and will now be my go-to solution for that gap). Harry definitely didn't go to Hogwarts infirmary unless something weird was going on.
