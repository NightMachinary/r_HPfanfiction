It's an interesting theory. Tho if true than it's mostly his fault Harry is that famous. After all, if there is no other source of info on the initial gossip, it means that Snape was the one to say that Harry vanquished Moldyshorts. And then years later he complains about his popularity. OH the irony XD For all they knew Voldy and Lily could have simultaneously defeated one another.

That said, I'm not sure Snape would have so easily identified the scar. After all the AK is supposed to leave no marks, even if he had detected some dark magic from the soul fragment I'm not so sure he would have quickly found out the whats and hows. Especially since at the time he was just a few years out of Hogwarts. I doubt he was that well versed at the time...
