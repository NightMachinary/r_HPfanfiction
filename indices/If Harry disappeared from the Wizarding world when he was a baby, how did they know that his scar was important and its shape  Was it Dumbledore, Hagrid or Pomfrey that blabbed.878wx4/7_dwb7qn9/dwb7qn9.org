I agree that Hagrid likely let slip some information since he's known for that problem.

However, isn't it also implied that Dumbledore intentionally let slip some information on Harry Potter to set him up as a hero and boost the Wizarding worlds morale? Wasn't Dumbledore the one who "told" the world what had happened at the Potters, even without knowing for sure what went down?
