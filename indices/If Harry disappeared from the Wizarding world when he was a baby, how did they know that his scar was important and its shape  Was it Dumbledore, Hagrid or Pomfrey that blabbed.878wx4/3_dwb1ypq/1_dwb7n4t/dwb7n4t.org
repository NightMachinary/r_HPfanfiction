So....

I had always understood that those "random people" were actually Order of the Phoenix members or people Dumbledore trusted to "keep an eye" on young Harry at times. It would make sense that since its just blood wards, and there are still Death Eaters out and about, that Harry would have had "watchers" most of his life. Plus it would be odd for random Wizards to show up in his muggle life knowing who he is already, scar or otherwise.

This is part of why I have always been suspicious of Dumbledore not being more aware of what went on at Privet Drive between the Dursleys and Harry.
