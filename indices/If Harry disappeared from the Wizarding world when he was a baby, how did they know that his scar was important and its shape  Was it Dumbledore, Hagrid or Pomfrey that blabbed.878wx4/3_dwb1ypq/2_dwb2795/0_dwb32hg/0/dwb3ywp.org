While that is true, it still begs the question how someone identified him for the first time, without that person knowing about the scar and its shape. Unless of course somebody did blab about it, which would most likely have been Hagrid.

As far as I remember, nobody in the wizarding world knew in what area the Dursleys live. Wizards/Witches had to know about the scar beforehand, so they could identify him.

Was it common knowledge back then that he lived with his muggle relatives ?
