Yes, McGonagall asks if he can do something about that scar and Dumbledore answered with:\\
"Even if I could I wouldn't."

Now that I think about it, I am not sure of the term "cursed scar" or something similar was brought up. But I still think, since Dumbledore admitted he cannot remove it, Hagrid thinks it has to be something magically powerful.
