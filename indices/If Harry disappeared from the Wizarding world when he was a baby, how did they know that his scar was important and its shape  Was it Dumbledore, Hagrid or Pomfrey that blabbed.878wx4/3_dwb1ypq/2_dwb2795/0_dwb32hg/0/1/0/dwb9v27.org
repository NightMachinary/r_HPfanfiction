But how was he identified ?

The last time he was seen, he was younger than 15 months and not a lot of people have seen him, since the Potters had to go into hiding after he was born.

So the only people that did see him, had to be order members or close friends. He couldn't have met many of those in my opinion.

The only one, who we know about he met was Diggle, who recognized him immediatly and I do not think he saw baby Harry very often. So it had to be the scar.

It is pretty hard to identify a child based on how he looked as a baby/toddler, especially if you don't know said child might be standing in front of you.
