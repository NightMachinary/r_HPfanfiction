Nah, not at all, if you haven't gotten to the Denarians yet you'll still be fine. No major plot points (of the Dresden files) are even mentioned in Renegade I believe. You'll just be confused every now and then if they mention characters, like other Denarians that are actually in the Dresden Files.

It's badass as fuck though, you should totally read it. It's one of my favorite crossovers.
