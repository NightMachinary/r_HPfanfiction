James Potter Joined the fight against wizard Hitler when he would have been fine if he just stayed on the sidelines

James Potter also befriended a werewolf which was a rare thing considering wizarding prejudice against werewolves

It's worth noting that in the first book McGonagall was quite broken up about James and lillys death

We also have to look at James potters last actions telling his wife and son to flee

bullying is wrong of course, but Voldemort is on the rise and this kid on the train is openly wanting to join said house

I picture those years at Hogwarts were a bit more dreary then Harrys first years
