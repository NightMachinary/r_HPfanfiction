I disagree people grow up for reasons all the time

snape was not a victimless party either he was hanging out with junior death eaters

Its not about idealizing its about knowing that some people get better as they age

soviets fought the nazis because hitler declared war on them

James as a pureblood could have sat the entire thing out but he decided to join Dumbledores little order

if he never grew as a person would dumbledore want someone like him in the order
