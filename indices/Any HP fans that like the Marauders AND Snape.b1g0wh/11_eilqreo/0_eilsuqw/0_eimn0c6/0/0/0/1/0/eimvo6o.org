I don't see the point of this argument. I didn't say “this is the only reasonable reading of James Potter” I said “I don't think he's redeemable'.

It's an opinion. It was stated as an opinion and I'm entitled to think what I think. Personally, I've never met a James Potter type who wasn't a total trash person. No matter the heroic shit they'd done.

An individual reading is informed by life experience. This is mine. Arguing with me won't retroactively change the people I've known in my life, or the things I've learned. In my experience Martyrs are selfish people nine times out of ten. James has all the red flags I've personally been trained to see for that kind of person. That doesn't mean he is or isn't like that. It means it's how I perceive him and my perception is solid because he's not real so he can't prove himself.
