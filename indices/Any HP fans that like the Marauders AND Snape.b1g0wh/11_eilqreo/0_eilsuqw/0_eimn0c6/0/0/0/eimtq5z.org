Justifications that come after the fact don't work so good though. James was a kid with a good home. He had money and access to everything he wanted. He picked a fight with Snape for no good reason, we're shown this in the year one flashback JK wrote it's literally canon. James was a popular kid and so was Sirius, both being in the community and having money/connections before Snape ever showed up which means the antagonistic attitude they took towards him likely made it more difficult for Snape to find friends in other positive influences Lilly easily became friends with.

And beyond that I was involved in activism in my youth. Many people in that field are in it for selfish reasons. James fighting Death Eaters does not make him a good person just because he did it.
