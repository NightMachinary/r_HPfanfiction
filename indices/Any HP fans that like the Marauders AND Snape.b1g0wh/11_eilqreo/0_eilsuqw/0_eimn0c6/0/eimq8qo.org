A person could do all of those ‘nice' things for selfish reasons and James was never Shown to get better. We're only told he got better by people who found him charming. Sorry if I take that with a grain of salt. I love the character. I just think people really idealize him in a way that's just not healthy. It's not realistic for someone to treat someone as badly as he treated Snape for no reason and just suddenly grow up and ‘see the light'. Dying for your family is still a selfish action in many regards. One might do that out of ego. Not every martyr is Jesus.

The Soviets fought the Nazis too man. Not everyone does good things for altruistic reasons.
