How is James irredeemable? I mean he pretty much was "redeemed" in canon. We know he grew out of his bad behaviour towards other students and became a far better person. In my experience, this is entirely plausible, and I've seen it happen frequently. Actually, when I look at people I went to school with, many of them totally changed after graduation. And I would argue that several of them are now better people. Yes, they did mean and stupid things, but they are not 15 anymore, and people /can/ grow out of bullying behaviour.

I would even argue that Snape can be redeemed, at least if you write about his youth. His behaviour as a teacher was appalling, but I think it's totally possible to find a way to redeem him as a young man (either before or right after he became a death eater).
