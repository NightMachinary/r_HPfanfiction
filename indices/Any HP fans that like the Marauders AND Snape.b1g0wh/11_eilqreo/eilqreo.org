Personally, I feel that James is morally no better than Snape, and if we're considering all these characters as simply characters I love them nearly equally because they result from some of the best snippets of writing in the series. Both characters are worth writing and writing well. They've both got a lot of interesting traits and potential.

That said I also think James Potter was an absolutely terrible person who was entirely irredeemable for his actions and I think most fans I've spoken to (American fans because I'm an American) misread Snape due to placing him in the wrong cultural context. That's not to argue that I think Snape can be redeemed, he can't really, but it's a little out there to say he stalked a girl he stopped talking to when she said â€˜stop talking to me'.
