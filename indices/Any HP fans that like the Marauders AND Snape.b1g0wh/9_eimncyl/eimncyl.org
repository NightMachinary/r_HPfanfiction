Marauder characters grown up in the novels, yes. I like Sirius and Remus, though Snape is my favorite. I am curious what it would take to reconcile their differences or find common ground. Some kind of life-threatening or crisis event, probably.

I don't like school-age Marauders. James and Black were arrogant bullies, Lupin was a coward for not standing up to them, and Peter was a sycophant. I didn't see much to redeem them, though we didn't see much at all from that time.
