My biggest problem with JKR's portrayal of the Marauder-era people is her portrayal -- or lack thereof -- of James. We as readers hear people keep telling how great he was, and yet our /only/ direct view of him is his bullying of Snape. We can draw conclusions that he became a better person (he became Head Boy, and I like to think that he didn't just get it from bias), but JKR /never/ portrays him in a good light (the "Lily, take Harry and run!" scene doesn't really count in either direction), to balance from what we saw in Sev's memories. This, IMO, is unfair to James. One thing I would have liked to see is Sirius and Remus, after Harry confronts them about Snape's Worst Memory, actually tell him anecdotes about James as a /truly likeable and good person/.
