I dislike both to be honest. Not the idea of them, but how they were portrayed by Rowling in the long run. Although to be fair, the more fanfiction I have read, the less I liked them so it wasn't like I just started off disliking them terribly. Plus I also dislike Dumbledore so... I guess I am not the most forgiving of all of the nonsense surrounding Harry they all were involved in in some way lol.
