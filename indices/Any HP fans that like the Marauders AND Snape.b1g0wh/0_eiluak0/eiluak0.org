Yes, I love writing about the Marauders (especially Sirius) /and/ Snape.

I wouldn't say that I'd like all of these characters if I met them in real life, but I definitely consider them interesting, and I don't like it when fics bash these characters because it seems like lazy writing. Sure, if I read a fic from Snape's perspective, I don't expect him to like the Marauders, but I don't wanna get the feeling that the author dislikes the Marauders, too.

I also think it's possible to write James in a likeable way without sugarcoating the flashback scene in OOTP. Likewise, I enjoy fics which explain Snape's motivation to join the DE without finding a moral justification for Voldemort's goals.

Yes, some things these characters do/did are inexcusable, but that doesn't mean that you cannot give them a well-developed backstory. I have always admired Rowling for her talent to give characters complexity and flaws without making them (necessarily) unlikeable and without bashing them. For example, Voldemort is without doubt a terrible person, but I never get the feeling that Rowling dislikes the character on a personal level. I wish more fanfic authors would portray morally grey or even negative characters this way.
