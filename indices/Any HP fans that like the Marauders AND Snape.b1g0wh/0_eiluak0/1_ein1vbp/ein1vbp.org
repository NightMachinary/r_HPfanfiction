James was very clearly in the wrong during that scene and acted disgustingly. That aside, I agree that he can still be written as likeable -- a single event doesn't define a person.

I do however have a very hard time liking Sirius. He may be loyal to his friends, but his strong malicious streak (which probably came from his upbringing) sits very badly with me.
