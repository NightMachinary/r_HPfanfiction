I am not a huge fan of Snape because of how he treated children in his adulthood. Basically, he should have known better but all in all I respect the way JK Rowling wrote him.

I like to read about him in fanfictions. I am not a fan of Snily but I make exceptions for AUs where he isn't on the way to be a Death Eater. (Seldom)

From the Marauders Era, James and Remus are my favourite. I also like Sirius a lot but he was kinda cruel. Peter did awful things but not while he was still in school so I hate seeing him bashed in Marauders Era fanfictions.
