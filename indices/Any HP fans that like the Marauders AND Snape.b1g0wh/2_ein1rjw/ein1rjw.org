I'm not really a fan of 1971-1976 Marauders at all -- OotP's "Snape's Worst Memory" heavily implies that their relentless bullying of Slytherins (or at least Snape) is /commonplace/ and a spectacle people in the school are used to. And then there is the werewolf prank... Not that Severus was a saint during this time, but to me, the Marauders always seemed worse during this time period (They were the initial instigators of the constant fighting, and Severus never did something matching werewolf prank in malice).

I think James did eventually grow up starting from the 6th year, especially during 7th year (he did become Head Boy). I have a much harder time seeing a more mature Sirius, however. Meanwhile, Snape turned into the bully we know from the HP era -- even worse during his true DE years, and I don't really like him in fics during 1977-1981.

I do, however, not like Jily. There's a few reasons for this: one, I simply, subjectively, prefer fics with the LESS pairing (allthough even if that particular ship doesn't happen, I still feel there's better alternatives -- particularly LERL). But in addition to this, James instigates the destruction of one of Lily's relationships not once, but /twice/ -- first with Severus during Snape's Worst Memory, then with Petunia during her wedding -- making me personally always feel James as being bad for her (why would you want to get together with someone who keeps ruining your friendships/etc?). In addition to this, I have similar reservations with this ship as with Ron/Hermione, another ship I don't like -- the fact that to me, they're simply too different. Moreover, James' pursuing of her during, at least, 5th year, when she clearly isn't interested, comes off as downright creepy, and I get the impression that she only started to give him notice at all as a result of werewolf prank misunderstandings... I always felt that, if not for special circumstances (the Prophecy), their marriage wouldn't have lasted. I don't /hate/ the pairing -- I can read fics with it, as long as it isn't the main focus of the fic.

I mostly read SS-centric fics, so I'm obviously biased here. That being said, I prefer to avoid fics portraying him during 1977-1981 (I prefer not to read about angsty villians, which I always figured was how Severus was during this time period -- fics portraying him as good during this time always came off as OOC), and prefer reading postwar (1998+, not 1981+) fics, where I figure he has opportunities to let go of unpleasant things from his past allowing him to become a better person, or 1960-1976 ones (or AUs where SWM never happens, or doesn't impact his life the same way).
