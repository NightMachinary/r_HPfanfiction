I'm a fan of all of them. Not as much Snape nowadays (tastes change), but I definitely like him more than other characters (Draco and Bellatrix come to mind). I have a time travel fic that gives the Marauders' antics and Snape's experiences if not *equal* weight, at least as much weight as each individual Marauder. That includes Peter, in that fic, because I'm trying to write his journey to betrayal as much as I'm writing everyone else's experiences.
