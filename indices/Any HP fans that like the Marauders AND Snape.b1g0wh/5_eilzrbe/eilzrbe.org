I like Remus and I like Snape, but I pretty much cannot stand Sirius and I'm generally ambivalent about James. I'm actually OK with Peter--he's a really interesting character, evil rat that he is. I think it's possible to like Snape and some of the Marauders, but what I'd be really interested in is finding a fan of both Sirius AND Snape, because they're like, mortal enemies.
