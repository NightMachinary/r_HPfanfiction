I mean, if the author is already writing an AU where Harry is born female, there is no reason they can't rewrite the prophecy to have she/her/hers pronouns. Seems silly to me to go "damn the canon prophecy says 'mark /him/ as his equal', guess I can't make fem!harry the chosen one."

As for Voldemort not seeing a girl as a threat, the only reason he thinks of Harry as a threat is because he thinks the prophecy refers to Harry.
