Couple things about that:

1. Snape, and thus Voldemort, only heard up to "born as the seventh month dies," and he therefore doesn't know that the prophecy refers to a male.

2. The prophecy is self-fulfilling. It doesn't, in itself, have any power, but the fact that Voldemort believes it means that he'll never stop seeing the subject, or the person he believes to be the subject, as a threat, and thus will never stop hunting them until they're dead.
