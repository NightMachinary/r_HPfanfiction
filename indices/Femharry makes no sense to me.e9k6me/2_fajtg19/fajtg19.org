I mean it is fanon, you can easily change the prophecy around to use female pronouns.

Plus, the only reason he went after Harry, and not Neville, who was a Pureblood, was because he thought Harry would be the bigger threat.

Seems kind of silly to me, thinking you can't make Harry a female and Girl Who Lived, just because of the pronouns.

I also don't see why he'd assume someone wasn't threatening just because they were the opposite gender, I don't see Voldemort worrying about something like that.
