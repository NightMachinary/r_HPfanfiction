[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9628375/1/][Malachite's Gift]] is part 1 of 3 for a non-bwl Potter who still grows up with the Dursleys and ends up in Slytherin (Dumbledore is fantastically lazy when it comes to people who aren't Neville). It's a little overwrought at times but a great read, especially later. The first five chapters of the first one are a little rough. More AU elements than you'd expect. And Ron manages to run his mouth enough to drive the plot at times instead of just getting himself in trouble, which is a little funny.

Can't recommend it enough. It's also a Slytherin Potter in which it isn't chock full of child politicians, so more points.
