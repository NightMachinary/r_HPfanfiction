All rants must:

- Have a word count of /at least/ 750 words.

- Have a minimum of 3 different curse/swear words used a minimum of 10 times

- Use as much emotive language as possible. But only if it's angry/rage/frustration etc.

- A minimum of 30% of the rant should be in all caps

- A minimum of 25 exclamation points, “!”, should be used, in groups of no less than three

- Whenever a question mark is used, at least 1 exclamation point, “!”, should be used in conjunction

The topic of choice is left up to the “ranter”, but for best results a topic that everyone who is meant to read the rants will already agree with the “ranter”'s opinion.
