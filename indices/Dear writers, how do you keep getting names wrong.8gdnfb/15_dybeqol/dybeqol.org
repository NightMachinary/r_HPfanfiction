Not that I've uploased anything yet, but I keep getting names wrong because Rowling uses uncommon spellings of real names and comes up with things like Karkaroff (which if it were a real name, would be Karkarov) or Rabastan (the most irritating) and because McGonagall is just a swine of a surname.

Even with editing passes, I know I will miss some. Bathsheda Babbling got pointed out down thread and it never occurred to me that Bathsheba Babbling might be wrong. And, when you google 'Bathsheba Babbling' the Bathsheda Babbling wiki page comes up and google does not ask 'did you mean...'

I /do/ try, but honestly, Rowling does actually make it hard.
