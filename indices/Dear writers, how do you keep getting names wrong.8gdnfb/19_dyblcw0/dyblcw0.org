I try to be as accurate as possible with my names and rarely get them wrong, but there have been a couple of incidents in my fic /Have You Ever Seen the Rain/, where I misspelled Roger Davies' name as Roger Davis.

However, subtle differences like these actually worked in my favour because I was having the fic take place in a massively AU-setting that wasn't technically real, just a copy of another reality - the canon HP Universe - so these in hindsight actually worked as a way of foreshadowing what was to come.
