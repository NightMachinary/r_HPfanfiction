I can look over mistakes like that if the story is really interesting. If people don't like it a lot of authors won't care, as long as they are getting other good reviews. We also have to remember that these authors (at least from what I know) aren't professionals. And yes, it would make stories better if they took the time to correct spelling and grammar mistakes, but you have to remember that for some authors it is hard enough just to write a story and post it.
