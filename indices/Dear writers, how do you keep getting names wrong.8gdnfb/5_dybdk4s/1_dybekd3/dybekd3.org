Yeah, I use all those versions of McGonagall. One of my edit passes is searching for them.

You missed out 'MacGonagall' which is my preferred mispelling. As in I've just realised that me and 'find and replace' are going to have an outing together soon on my current stories After I've checked the wiki /again/ to make absolutely sure because I thought I really actually had it this time.
