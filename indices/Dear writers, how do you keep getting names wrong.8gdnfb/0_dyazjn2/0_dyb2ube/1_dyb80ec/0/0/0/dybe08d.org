~scribbles down some ideas~

Let's see, the beautiful Princess Daphne Greengrass who-was-never-characterised-in-canon has her wedding to the boring Prince Gregory Goyle arranged, but she ends up running out on the wedding right at the altar.

On her way out of Hogwarts, however, she and her house-elf are ambushed by Blonde Hairdo and taken captive; with little other choice, King Greengrass calls upon Harry Potter and his snarky sidekick Crookshanks (borrowed from Hermione, natch) to rescue her.

A globe-trotting adventure ensues, Griphook shows Harry how to use some fancy-schmancy secret goblin magic, Blonde Hairdo threatens Daphne ("her /old/ nose!") to get the King to lower his estate wards and let the Wizzballs take all of his lush green turf.

Harry saves the day, discovers from Griphook that he has a lovely big inheritance (most of magical Britain) and is a fancy prince and everything, so he bursts in to halt the wedding and marries Greengrass and they all live happily ever after.

...Uh, wait, was the request for mashup or crossover?
