Not at all. Well, definitely not always. I have to /constantly/ go back and take the r out of Voldemort because 'lder' is a common (enough) combination in English and 'ldem' is not. Fingers just automatically go there. And sometimes I don't even see I've done it.

American writers definitely would not do it by sound because they have a rhotic r, so 'Voldemort' and 'Voldermort' sound different. (Nor would those from Cornwall and Devon I expect.)
