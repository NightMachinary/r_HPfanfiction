Yep, non-native speakers are usually quite paranoid about their spelling and will look up anything they are even a little bit unsure about. As a result of that their spelling is usually pretty good, they just tend to use wrong or inappropriate words or fuck up the grammar.

"Harry must of put his name in the Goblet." is another example of an error that only a native speaker would make.
