Jim Dale gets it right for the first 3. He changed after the first movie came out.

I remember when I was a kid and there was some controversy between my sister and me about the right way to pronounce Voldemort. We found a Harry Potter site online (this was back in the days of dial-up internet and the original iMac) where you could click on different words and someone would pronounce them. We scrolled down to Voldemort, clicked on it, and the audio said, "We do not speak the name." That was the best anyone has ever trolled me.
