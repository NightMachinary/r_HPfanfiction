So in high school, I had an American Humanities teacher who fancied himself a bit of a comedian. On the first day of school, one of the students had a French student with her--she'd been on some sort of exchange program over the summer. This was the front-and-center girl, so they're both right up there in front of the teacher. The conversation as I remember it, went like this:

"Oh you're from France? I can't speak French, but I can laugh in French." The teacher proceeds to lean over and get in this poor girl's face and loudly do the dumbest parody of the stereotypical "French laugh". I just sank down in my seat.

Ove twenty years have passed since that mortifying moment, but every time someone mentions French and laughing, that is what I think of.
