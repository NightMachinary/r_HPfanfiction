The way Rowling pronounces it is the French way, and it sounds a lot more menacing and "better" that way. My headcanon is that Riddle knew the correct pronunciation and got so frustrated with all his fellow countrymen pronouncing it wrong and making him look like a weenie, that the "He-who-must-not-be-named" effect came into play due to his not wanting to hear it any more.
