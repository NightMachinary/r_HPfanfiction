Tom Riddle wasn't French, so it seems to me that the way he pronounced his made up name is how it ought to be pronounced.

Similarly, some American cities have historically French names, but the people living there now don't pronounce it the same as someone from France would read it.

Example - Gautier is pronounced "Go-Shay" and if a French speaker asked a local for directions to "Gah-tee-ay" they'd be laughed at.
