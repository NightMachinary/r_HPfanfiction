I don't often encounter this problem with characters that come up often like the two you named, probably because if I did see that happen, I'd just drop the story in question.

I do think that for some characters it could be forgiven though, for instance, Professor Babblings first name is Bathsheda, which isn't a real name and also looks a lot like the real name Bathsheba. Or Rabastan, which again is not real and very similar to Rastaban, which is a star in the Draco constellation.

So yeah, my advice is if a story can't get some common characters' name right, drop the story. Trying to hold fanfic writers of all people to a higher standard is only going to frustrate you as they likely don't care.
