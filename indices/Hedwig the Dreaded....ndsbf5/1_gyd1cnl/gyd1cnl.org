When Hedwig "dies" it pisses her off, and she transforms into her true form. Driving the Death Eaters chasing her human insane and dismembering quite a few.

Harry didn't see any of this, he is surprised when he arrives at Grimmauld Place to find Hedwig sitting on her perch, precking at him happily.

Harry decides to ignore that she was covered in blood and ... the fact she had teeth for a moment when she smiled at him.
