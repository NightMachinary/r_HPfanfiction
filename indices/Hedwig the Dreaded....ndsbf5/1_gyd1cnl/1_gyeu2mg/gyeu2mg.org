Every full moon they find a Death Eater dead somewhere, their faces ripped off and their masks fused to the bone to become their new faces in death.

No matter where they go, no matter where they hide, no matter if they stick together (blink and they're gone), there's always a death.

Voldemort becomes annoyed his Death Eaters are beginning to panic.
