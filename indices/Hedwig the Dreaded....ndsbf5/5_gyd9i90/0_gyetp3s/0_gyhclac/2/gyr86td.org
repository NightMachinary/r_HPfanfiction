Jeconais has an excellent fic called Matryoshka Vignettes, which is a sequel to his other excellent fic Perfect Situations. MV is basically the fallout of PS, as told by about 15 different characters. One chapter, guest written by Crys, is from Fawkes's perspective and is probably my favorite of this genre. Highly recommend reading both, in order or else most of it won't make sense
