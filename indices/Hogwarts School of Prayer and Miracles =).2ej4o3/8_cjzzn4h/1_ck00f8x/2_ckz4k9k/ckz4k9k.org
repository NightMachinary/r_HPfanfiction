C. S. Lewis, the author of the Chronicles of Narnia, was an incredibly devout Christian who wrote many books based on his faith.

Even as a young reader, it was the parallels between Narnia and the Christian faith were pretty obvious to me. I interpreted that Aslan was Jesus, but taking on the form of a lion for that particular world.

No one had to tell me this. I didn't have the internet to look it up. It was just that obvious that the lion was Jesus.

I'm sure you're enjoying writing your fanfic, but I feel very sorry for your sheltered kids that you even deny them actual Christian based fantasy, with very Christian themes.

Why don't you read The Magicians Nephew, the first book is the series, and then decide? You obviously know nothing about it.
