I would suggest you forego any literature written after the seventeenth century, meaning you keep only religious text in their reading list. You can find satanism and non-family friendly rhetoric in every novel, if you set your mind to it. Reading books with diverse ideas would not make you follow any of those things, it will broaden your mind. Instilling Christian believes and morale in your kids is your job, not literature's. You can let them read classics, as they were written by their authors and keep them obedient, nice and God fearing. You can explain the difference between fiction and reality, there is no need to bastardize classics like Narnia in order to keep your kids sheltered by what you view as evil and wrong. You are just setting yourself up for conflicts.
