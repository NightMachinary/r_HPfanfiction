Please tell me this is a joke. If you do not want your children to read about witchcraft, because you're scared they'll "turn into witches", then read them the seven Narnia books. Those are nice and Christian-friendly. Your children will be bullied at school when they don't know what Harry Potter really is about, but think they do. They'll watch the movies at a party and don't know what is going on. You're going to alienate your kids if you go through with it, and murder a great story along the way. (I also would like to add that the numerous times I've read the Harry Potter books didn't turn me into a witch.)
