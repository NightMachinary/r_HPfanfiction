I have a few concerns about some of the lessons in the first chapters of your story so far.

Why do you mention sex and the city in a children's story?

Also, you imply that someone with a southern accent is someone to trust. Shouldn't your children learn to trust people based on their actions, not based on their accent?

I'm addition, defining Christians as people who want to be good implies that non Christian don't want to be good. This is incorrect and may be confusing to them. Lots of people of many beliefs want to be good. Many religions teach about being "good." Being good is not what defines a Christian, even though there are surely Christians who want to do good, there are non Christians who want to do good.

I don't understand why your story teaches that women should not have careers. Perhaps you should read about Deborah, who was a judge and military leader in Israel. There is a book in the Bible called "Judges" and you can read about her there.
