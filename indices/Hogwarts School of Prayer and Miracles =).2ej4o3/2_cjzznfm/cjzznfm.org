Welcome to this subreddit! I'll admit, I always thought that reports of the /Harry Potter/ books encouraging witchcraft were satire; could you please elaborate a little on how these books are not "family friendly", as you put it? I understand that some "rituals" described in the books might seem "satanical", but those are clearly frowned upon by the magical community (with the exception of Durmstrang, supposedly) as Rowling describes it. The main characters of the book have all suffered due to the use of "dark magic", which is presented as an often uncontrollable, malignant force.

Personally, I feel like traditional Christian ideas can be introduced into the world of Harry Potter without completely excluding the magic of JKR's world: simply think of the character of van Helsing in /Dracula/, or more generally Christian symbolism like the cross, holy water, etc. All of these can be given a "magical" meaning that meshes with the existing lore (cf. vampire fanfiction).

As an aside, why do you feel it necessary to attack evolution in your story? I don't think it is even remotely addressed in canon, though this may be part of JKR's exclusion of science (magical or not) in her books.

I'll be honest and say your story reads like a proselytizing rant against non-Christians (or nonbelievers in general), rife with stereotypes but lacking in any convincing arguments (prove that evolution is true? The wikipedia page for evolutionary biology is enough to see there is a rich body of evidence to support evolution.) Without going too much into the religious debate, I'm afraid your fic bears all the attributes of a "bashing"-fic, and so I will not be following it, much as I would have liked to see a well-written Christian narrative set in the world of Harry Potter.

EDIT: And how is Ron depraved? He uses the Imperius curse once, but I don't recall him using any other "dark" magic. If you are simply attacking /all/ witches and wizards, why him?

EDIT^{2:} WTF? The /rebellion/? Are you seriously suggesting that the resistance against Voldemort is something you want to eliminate in your story? Or do you mean any type of disobedience (which is arguably even more troubling) ?

EDIT^{3:} lol "socialism".
