Wow!!! Thank you for this well thought out response!!! I would say that the fact that the characters use "witchcraft" and "wizardry" in the first place is not family friendly. I understand what you are saying-----there are a lot of good things about these books-----but why not keep those good parts but take out the "witchcraft" parts? That is what I think.

And I am not attacking Evolution. I just thought it would be fun and educational to put some scientific debate in there for my little ones. My youngest one is such a little scientist, I just know he would love it!!!

I am sorry it is not well-written. I must admit: I am not the best writer. You seem like a very intelligent person; and I am sure that you read a lot of classic literature and such; and I know my little story does not measure up to that. It is just a fun little story for my little ones and other concerned mommies =)

Blessings!
