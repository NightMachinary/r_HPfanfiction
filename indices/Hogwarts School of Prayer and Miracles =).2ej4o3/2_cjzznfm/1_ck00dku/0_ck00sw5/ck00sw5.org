I'm glad you decided to answer.

Some of the most beautiful parts in the books are deeply magical- Harry's discovery of the Mirror of Erised, the first description of Hogwarts, etc. If you remove those, you have the story of a mistreated orphan being sent to a faraway school, and then being coerced into fighting a mass murderer. I think we can agree that's not exactly as family-friendly as the original story. Much of /Harry Potter/'s charm is in its escapism, but an acknowledged escapism. Replacing magic with religion also removes the suspension of disbelief, since you bring aspects of everyday religious life into the story.

Regarding your description of a "debate" between a creationist and a proponent of evolution: I hope this is not what you consider a "debate" in real life.

I didn't say your story was badly written. I didn't really pay attention to the style because of how boggled I was at the content. That said, on the surface it seems quite clear.

I only wish to plead for your children's right to read what is undoubtedly a very good children-to-teenager's story, and not to force such grown-up concerns as religious morality, evolution etc. onto the books. Their intent is not to turn children away from the "right" path, only to entertain, and perhaps showcase the value of friendship and love; as such, please reconsider your decision to censor them. Whether or not you allow your children to read the original books, they will be confronted with unchristian-like ideas sooner or later. Why, then, compromise their childhood as well?

EDIT: Troll or not, I find this highly amusing
