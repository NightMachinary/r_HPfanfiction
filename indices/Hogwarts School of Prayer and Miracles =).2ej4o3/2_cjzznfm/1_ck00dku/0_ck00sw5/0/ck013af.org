Don't worry; I will be letting my kids read Harry Potter. Just without the witchcraft. That is why I am writing this=) And oh, I know they will run into un-Christian ideas, in this modern world!!! That is why I included non-Christian characters in the story (e.g. Aunt Petunia!!!); so they will know how to handle these situations in real life. But I am glad you found it entertaining!!!

Edit: never mind, fixed it!
