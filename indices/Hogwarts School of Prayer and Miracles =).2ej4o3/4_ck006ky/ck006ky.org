Saying Harry Potter teaches kids how to be witches and wizards is like saying Grey's Anatomy teaches children how to be doctors... Also, this is a terrible representation of atheists. Atheists want to be good people just like Christians. My boyfriend and good friend are both Atheists and they are both kind caring people that want to help others and they do it believing there is no afterlife. Harry Potter teaches about tolerance and acceptance. That is the main message of the books, this looks as though it will only teach one line of thought.
