  I am not sure if I will be able to post on this reddit anymore. People have been calling me names, and I don't appreciate a bullying environment. I know that I am a new user, I thought this would be a good place to share my little story, but perhaps not. I see that this is not a place where Christians are welcome.

Christ taught us to turn the other cheek to our oppressors, not to lash out at them passive aggressively. Please read Matthew 5:39.

He also had rather strong things to say about affecting overt religiosity in the Parable of the Pharisee and the Publican: "I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted." (Luke 19:14, NIV). You, my good person, appear to be exalting yourself and denigrating others, which is decidedly un-Christ-like.
