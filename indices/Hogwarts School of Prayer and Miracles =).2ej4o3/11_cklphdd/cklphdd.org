I am wondering, OP, about your decision your children will not be reading about witchcraft. I take it you mean in any form, not just as regards the Harry Potter books, correct? However, considering witchcraft is not real, and through reading these books no-one will ever learn how to BE a witch or wizard, what is the harm? I never understood the stance against the HP (and similar) books when it's not as if spells and charms actually work in real life. It's a bit like prayer: you might try it, and use any excuse available if what you want to happen doesn't happen, but at the end of the day prayer is simply to give people comfort. It doesn't cause things to actually occur. Dabbling in charms and spells are the same...they don't do anything.
