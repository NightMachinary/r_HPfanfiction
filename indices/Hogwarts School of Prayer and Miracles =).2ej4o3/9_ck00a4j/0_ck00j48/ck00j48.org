I looked up the term "troll"; and I think I know what you are talking about: the teleporting in chapter two. Am I right? =) I know that prayer does not work that way in real life. It was just supposed to be fun. But maybe it was too unrealistic. I am sorry. I will try to do better in future chapters =)
