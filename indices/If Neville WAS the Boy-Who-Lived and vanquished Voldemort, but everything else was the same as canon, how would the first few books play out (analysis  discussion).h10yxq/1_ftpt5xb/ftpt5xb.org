I'm not sure the premise works. Why would everything be the same?

That there is no reason for Harry to go the Dursleys was already pointed out. The most logical outcome is that Sirius remains Harry's godfather, and he will grow up with him. So Harry won't be the same person. On the other hand, Neville won't be the same person either, and even Augusta may act differently -- perhaps she actually /is/ proud of Neville, him having defeated Voldemort (clearly a sign of magic) -- and he enters Hogwarts as the kind of person Snape always insisted Harry was: arrogant and with an oversized ego.

I'm not sure where your take on Ron and Hermione comes from. Hermione is a nightmare and doesn't have friends for a reason. Ron isn't "nudged" towards anyone, he happens to sit in the same train compartment and is your average 11 year old bloke. More importantly, Neville might already know him, and so might Harry for both of them, given that he grows up in the Wizarding World -- or then again either of them might not, and have no reason to know him before or during Hogwarts, because they have other friends. There are more Houses than just Gryffindor, and friends "close in age" needn't mean the same year at Hogwarts.

Going with bigheaded!Neville, he'll dominate the Gryffindor crowd, and if he has been encouraged to be overconfident, he will act in just the way Harry has in Canon, except for reasons of fame or recognition. Harry, meanwhile, has possibly stumbled over stuff from Regulus, and gets sorted into Slytherin, after all. Sirius is miffed, but loves him all the same.

At this point you can write a nice Slytherin!Harry, while antagonist!Neville annoyingly struts around the school and keeps poking his nose where it doesn't belong. Or that's not how it happens, and you write something else entirely. Changing something as big as who the BWL is, I don't see any "obvious" way things would have to happen from then on out.

Still, plot points to consider:

- Hermione dies in the bathroom
- Hagrid's hut spontaneously combusts and reveals a dragon the size of a dinner table
- The PS is lost when Quirrelmort shatters the mirror, as neither he nor Neville can get the stone out
- Alternatively, Quirrelmost is successful -- possibly not even at the end of the year, but sooner -- and Voldemort returns in first year
