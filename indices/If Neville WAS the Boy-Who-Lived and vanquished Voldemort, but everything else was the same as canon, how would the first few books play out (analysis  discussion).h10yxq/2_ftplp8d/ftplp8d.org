Eh...

No reason for Harry to go to the Dursleys or for Petunia to keep him. Snape also has no reason to turn on /Voldemort/. He doesn't need an elaborate plan to kill the Lestranges and BCJ if Lily is harmed by them.

Harry interacts with Seamus a bit in canon and they get along well enough for Seamus to lend him his chessmen when he goes home for Christmas. I don't see why Harry would be excluded from the group or why this (possibly) more well adjusted child would find Hermione more likable.

Malfoy is definitely a secondary antagonist here. Ron is still poor and he bullied Neville because he could.

Regardless of Neville's personality, though, I don't think Ginny sees the end of CoS and don't think Neville makes it past GoF.
