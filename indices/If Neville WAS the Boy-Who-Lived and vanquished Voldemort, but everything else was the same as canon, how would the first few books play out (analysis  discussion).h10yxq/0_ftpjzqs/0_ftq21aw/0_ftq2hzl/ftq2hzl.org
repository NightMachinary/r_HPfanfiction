That's a fair point actually! Alternatively, they could just have brought down the fidelius after Voldemort died (I assume that's what the Longbottoms did in canon? Not sure, but I seem to recall Dumbledore telling both families to hide) and so Peter didn't actually betray them. Could be an interesting redemption arc for him there, since he technically didn't even do anything horrible. I'm a sucker for stories that feature Wormtail as an actual character, he gets killed even in most death eater Harry fics.
