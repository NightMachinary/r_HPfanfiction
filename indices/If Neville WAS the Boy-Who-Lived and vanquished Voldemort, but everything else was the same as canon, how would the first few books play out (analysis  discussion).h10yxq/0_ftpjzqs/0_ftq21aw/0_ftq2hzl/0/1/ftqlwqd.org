Why would he not kill Peter? Even if his only major fault is being a coward, and all his actions is a result of this, this would mean that he isn't exactly loyal. Why would you keep around someone who can be threatened to switch sides at any moment? And then there's obviously the personal angle, if Harry is still vengeful about his parents being dead, despite being a Death Eater.

Also, Peter, for whatever reason, decided to take initiative on resurrecting Voldemort. That doesn't really strike me as a cowardly action. Hell, that might actually have been one of the bravest actions he has done. Stupid, and evil, but brave regardless.
