In that case, I'd wager that the named Death Eaters we actually see are the inner circle. Like it just seems silly to think that Voldemort would be able to take over a country with what, ten people? Even if people like Bellatrix and Dolohov are a lot stronger then the average person, I doubt they could take on the entirety of Wizarding Britain. There are most likely hundreds of them in the ranks, ones that didn't get caught because they're just grunts while the Aurors and the Order focused on the leaders. Since Voldemort was so obsessed with the prophecy, it would make sense for him to only send his very best into the DoM. Even if his very best turned out to be no match for six teenagers and a bunch of glorified housewifes (seriously, the Order has what, four aurors if Sirius being an ex-auror is canon? The rest aren't exactly fighting material.)
