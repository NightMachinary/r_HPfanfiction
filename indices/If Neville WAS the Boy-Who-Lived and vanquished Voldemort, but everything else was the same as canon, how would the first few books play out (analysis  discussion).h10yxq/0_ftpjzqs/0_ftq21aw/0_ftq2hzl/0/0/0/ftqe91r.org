In the graveyard in GoF, Voldmort's followers gather in a circle with clear positions, leaving spaces for those not there. Snape has one of those places though in that exact moment Voldmort thought Snape was against him. Either there are very few actual death eaters or there is a 'inner circle,' of which Snape had a place.
