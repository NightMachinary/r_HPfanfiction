One thing I've considered doing is making a fic depicting Snape's life in a canon-compilant manner in 2 different ways in parallell where we see his thoughts and motivations in both -- one where he is irredeemably evil, the other where he is a victim of circumstances, as a way to try to show that both interpretations are valid and that there's no reason to put Snape in either extreme in fics, and getting into flamewars about him is pointless.
