My opinion on that honestly shifts a lot throughout the story. In general I just see him as a character, but every time I read a rendition of him trying to get Sirius executed at the end of PoA, I honestly get pissed.

That bit is a nice plot point, though. I remember reading a two-shot fic where Snape manages to get Sirius executed, and Harry ends up willingly handing himself over to Voldemort in exchange for Voldemort torturing Snape to death.
