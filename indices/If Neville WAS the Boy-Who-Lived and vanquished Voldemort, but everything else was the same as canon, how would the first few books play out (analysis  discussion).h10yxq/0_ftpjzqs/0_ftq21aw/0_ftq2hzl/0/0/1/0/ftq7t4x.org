I feel like a lot of it boils down to all the characters in the books being pretty much one thing without any nuance. It would be very interesting to read a fic where the only change is having the characters be less one-dimensional. I mean all the Death Eaters are basically caricatures with no positive traits, while a lot of the light side just sorta have one thing going for them. Bellatrix is the insane witch, Pettigrew is the cowardly rat, Lucius is ridiculously xenophobic, rude, has nice hair and bribes a lot, Voldemort is the big bad and obsessed with stuff with nothing else ever going for him. Molly is an overbearing mother, Neville is a coward, Hermione likes to read, Fred and George prank people, Dumbledore is Gandalf, Bill has a cool earring, Luna is not like the other girls.

Like if the characters were fleshed out a bit more, the whole story would change, even if the end result would still be the same. Seeing the reasons behind people's actions and a bit of nuance in everything would change Harry's decisions. And Dumbledore's, and Voldemort's for that matter. And don't even get me started on Fudge and Umbridge, there was so much potential in that story arc but it all literally boiled down to Rowling being anti-government and going about it in an extremely blunt, almost parody-like way by flat out portraying Fudge as an idiot.
