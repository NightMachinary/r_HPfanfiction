That is understandable. I just feel that whenever I read hpff community discussion, Snape is inevitably brought up sooner or later, with some people thinking he deserved better and some others thinking he deserved all the pain he got and more.

I mean, I mostly read Snape fics so I guess that in a sense I am no better, but I typically don't really bother arguing against people whose opinions differ from me specifically because the argument could go on forever.
