In his defence, because we are reading this from Harry's perspective we would've never gotten a redemption arc because while Snape was worse than Peter (in my opinion), what Wormtail did was personal. Especially since when Harry finds out what he did Sirius and Remus is there. I don' think Snape would've continued serving Voldemort in this scenario because while Lilly lives, she is unresponsive and although I don't think he would be as devastated as in canon, I still think he would've switched sides.

I haven't read the books in a while too but I think Snape was pretty important even if there was no 'inner circle', while I agree that Snape is worse than Peter in that sense that he was just a coward but he still betrayed his friends and I think none of them deserves a redemption arc.
