Eh. Snape is one of the few characters I actually like seeing bashed, mostly because I truly feel his canon bullshit because my math teacher often marked me down due to my mom bullying her in school. Although I'm not exactly fond of bashing in general, and I can easily see Snape as a good guy in fanfiction. Honestly, there's only one fandom character that I hate with an undying passion, and I can't see myself ever adding another one to that list.
