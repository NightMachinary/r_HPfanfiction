It's not just the fact that he's useful. He's a weak, cowardly person that was most likely threatened into joining. Like he's not even all that evil. Snape joined the Death Eaters willingly and rose to the Inner Circle (wait, is that canon? The last time I actually the books was pretty much within a month of each coming out so it's a bit muddy) on his own merit and depravity, then switched sides after he indiredtly murdered his obsession. If Lily hadn't died, Snape would just continue serving Voldemort without issue. If anything, Peter would deserve more of a chance at redemption then Snape does. I mean, I don't personally think that either of them does as they are in canon, but if I had to pick one of them it would be Peter.
