In A) I think since technically James and Lilly are alive, at least somewhat, Sirius wouldn't have gone that ballistic with trying to hunt down Wormtail so I don't think he would have gone to Azkaban. And since Harry didn't survive the Killing Curse and became "The-Boy-Who-Lived" it is possible that Hagrid didn't come to the house to take him.

It would change so much, even from the beginning.
