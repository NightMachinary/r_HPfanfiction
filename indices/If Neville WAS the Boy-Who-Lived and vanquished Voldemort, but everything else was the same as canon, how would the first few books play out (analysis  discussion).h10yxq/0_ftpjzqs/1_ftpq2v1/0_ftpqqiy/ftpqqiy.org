I mean, fame definitely changes people. I also wouldn't be surprised if either Dumbledore or the Ministry (most likely both) kept a close eye on Neville since, unlike Harry, he's not hidden away from the world. Especially with that shitty uncle Neville has - he seems to be the exact sort of person to flaunt the everliving shit out of the Boy Who Lived.

Also, being raised in the spotlight with tons of fans would probably make him a cocky little shit, even if he is shit. I've read a couple dimension travel fics where Neville is the BWL, and I honestly just can't find holes in their logic of it.
