But isn't Neville canonically crap in the first few books due to shyness and a poor wand, and due to his shyness clashing with Augusta's outspokenness? If he was the BWL none of those core aspects would change /unless/ he had a different wand - if Frank's was, perhaps, destroyed.

Augusta is still a poor parent substitute /unless/ for some reason she embraces the fame of being the guardian of the BWL and becomes a very different character.
