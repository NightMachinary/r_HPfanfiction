I don't think Neville would be anything like canon if he was the BWL. His family treated him like crap because, in their eyes, he was crap. If he was the BWL, he would most likely be treated better. He wouldn't spend time gardening to get away from it. Also do remember that the entire "Dumbledore controlled every single bit of Harry's life" thing is a fanfiction construct. It wouldn't have to go the same way, with the Mirror and stuff. Neville would most likely be something akin to a Gryffindor Malfoy.

Although it would be quite interesting to watch Harry in that case, with one of three possibilities coming to mind:

A) A canon flip in which Lily and James get turned into vegetables as canon Longbottoms did. There's no need to hide Harry away so he would likely be raised by someone in the wizarding world (Remus? Minerva? Not sure if Alice being his godmother was canon, but if it was, raised alongside Neville by Augusta?)

B) Lily and James are still vegetables, but he goes to the Dursleys. Malfoy wouldn't have a reason to drive him away, Ron wouldn't fanboy over him, so potentially a Slytherin!Harry trying to make his way in the wizarding world without any guidance? Quite likely becoming a Death Eater in the process.

C) Lily and James are all good and healthy, Harry grows up to be Snape's worst nightmare. A Golden Trio of Neville, Harry and Hermione, potentially?
