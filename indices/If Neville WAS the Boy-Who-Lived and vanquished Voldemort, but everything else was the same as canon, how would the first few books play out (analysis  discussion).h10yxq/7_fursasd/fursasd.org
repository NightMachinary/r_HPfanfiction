I think Sirius easiest Harry. As Hagrid might not be sent there. Assuming Harry is raised magical he would be different. If Sirius takes control over his family could he bring Andromeda back into the family and maybe kick out Belatrix for going after Harry's parents? If Harry is taught about his parents early he might be inclined to study more. With him being potentially closer with Tonks Hufflepuff could be a option. Maybe a Ravenclaw Harry has a better chance of happing. I could see Neville cracking under the pressure. I think neither helps Hermione who either dies it severally injured. This could cause the press to use the story in the future. Would be be able to handle the snake second year? With the potential loss of Ron's friendship as early as first year.(if Hermione dies or is hurt) he may become more withdrawn.if the rumors spread he hated muggleborn students first year the coming out as a Pareseltounge the second year and the heir problem would be worse. If Neville survives the first 2 years then year 3 should be normal and year 4 is really bad. Look how Harry handled being alone with the first task. Now imagine that all year and the only support is a secret death eater. If Neville survives the 3 tasks he may not win and whoever reached the cup dies to bring Voldemort back. With Voldemort back without Dumbledore knowing would cause year 5 to be normal untill maybe Neville gets a vision of his grandmother at the ministry. Would be go to Dumbledore or McGonagall and would they think it's just a nightmare? During year 5 would Snape feed Dumbledore information as Harry is safe? Year 6 is the Azkaban breakout and panic. Who will side with Dumbledore and if they must believe in Neville. The Weasley family might be at odds by what happened first year (how would Hermione affect Ron and the rest of the family) and Ginny's potential death year 2?
