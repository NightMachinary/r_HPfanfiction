Truthfully I can see quirell managing to get the stone at the end of the first year and reviving Tom early unless dumbledore manages to stop him First year Neville can barely stand up to the trio and snape terrifies him so facing Tom is out of the question Also what happened to sirius and Remus in this situation? Same as canon? Because if James and Lily's situation is switched with Alice and franks then Sirius has more reason to stay and look after them then he has to go after Peter
