Would Dumbledore send Hagrid to introduce a-Dursley-raised-Harry to the wizarding world if he wasn't the boy-who-lived? Wouldn't Ron look for Neville on the Hogwarts express? Without Harry befriending Ron on the train shouldn't that increase Harry's chances of being sorted into Slytherin since he would have less reason to chant Not Slytherin to the sorting hat?
