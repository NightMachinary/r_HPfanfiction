It depends on what happened to Harry, if his parents are alive, then he grows up completely different than canon Harry, maybe he's less like James and more like Lily.

Snape would also have no reason to betray Voldemort, unless Lily was attacked by Bellatrix and Co.

Neville would grow up a little differently maybe, perhaps his family would put even more pressure on him.

IF Lily and James are unavailable, then either Sirius gets him or any other families since he doesn't need protection, if for some stupid reason he's still sent to the Dursley's, then his chance to become a Death Eater just increases by some 30%.

If he's raised by Sirius, probably even adopted if Sirius doesn't want to have a wife for some reason, then it's up to how you characterize Sirius and Remus. He could be like Draco or like Sirius OR be more unique.

Neville being BWL would change a lot for Harry's first years.
