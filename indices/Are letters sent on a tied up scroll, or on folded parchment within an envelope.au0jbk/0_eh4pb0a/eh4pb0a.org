The Hogwarts Letters are sent in envelopes, clearly enough. I /think/ this is mentioned at some point, but if nothing else, I don't think Muggle-raised Harry would so readily have recognized his as a letter when it first arrived otherwise.

It may be that /some/ letters in the Wizarding World are sent as scrolls, mind you. Could be that the Hogwarts Letters only look as they do in order not to endanger the Statute when they're delivered to Muggle-borns. But I think that's a fairly unlikely supposition in the absence of other evidence.
