I'm ~90% certain that the Howler Ron gets in /CoS/ came in a red envelope. I cannot think of a single other case (beyond the Howler, Hogwarts letters and letters from the Ministry) that talk about letters via owls coming in envelopes. I'm equally as certain we never see a letter delivered as a scroll.

Actually, even before posting this comment, I recalled and then looked up the following section from /CoS/

  “Have you been stopping my letters?”

  “Dobby has them here, sir,” said the elf. Stepping nimbly out of Harry's reach, he pulled a thick wad of envelopes from the inside of the pillowcase he was wearing. Harry could make out Hermione's neat writing, Ron's untidy scrawl, and even a scribble that looked as though it was from the Hogwarts gamekeeper, Hagrid.

Ron and Hagrid both sent Harry letters during the summer that used envelopes.

Envelopes, not scrolls.
