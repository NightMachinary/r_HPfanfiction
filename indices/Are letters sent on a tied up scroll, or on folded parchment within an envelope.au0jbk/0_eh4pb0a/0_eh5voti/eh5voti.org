I ctrl-F'd for "scroll", "roll of parchment" and "envelope" in PDFs of the books and ran the numbers. Numbers might be off since these copies look like they were OCR'd and might be bolloxed up in places.

tl;dr: Everyone uses envelopes until around GoF/OotP. Then, personal mail gets sent as a scroll, official mail gets sent in envelopes. I only counted stuff sent by owl, but tons of people hand-deliver scrolls of parchment (Slug Club and Dumbles invitations) in HBP.

PS:

- Envelopes: *(1)* Harry's Hogwarts letters

CoS:

- Envelopes: *(5)* Dobby's intercepted letters, Hogwarts letters, Ron's Howler, Lockhart's fanmail, Filch's Kwikspell letter

PoA:

- Envelopes: *(5)* Ron's letter to Harry, Hogwarts letter, Neville's Howler, Hagrid's letter to Harry, Sirius's letter to Harry

GoF:

- Envelopes: *(3)* World Cup letter from Ron, Hermione's hate mail (incl. Bubotuber pus), Twins' blackmail to Bagman

- Scrolls: *(1)* Sirius's letter to Harry

OoTP:

- Envelopes: *(6)* Ministry letters to Harry, Dumbles's Howler to Petunia, Hogwarts letters, Lockhart's fanmail, Rita Skeeter's letter to Hermione, Harry's letters from Quibbler readers

- Scrolls: *(4)* Order letters to Harry (described as "roll of parchment"), Harry writing to Sirius/Ron/Hermione, Percy's letter to Ron, Sirius's intercepted letter to Harry

HBP:

- Envelopes: *(1)* Hogwarts letters

- Scrolls: *(1)* Dumbles's letter to Harry
