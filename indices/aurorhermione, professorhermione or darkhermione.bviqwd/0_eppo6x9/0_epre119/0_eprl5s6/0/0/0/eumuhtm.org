No, it doesn't, but it should try, unless there is a good reason not to. In very general terms, by labelling something a fanfic, you import the reader's notions of the characters and the setting from canon, and, very importantly, you import whatever suspensions of disbelief they have had to make. Every deviation from canon is additional cognitive load on the reader and requires its own suspension of disbelief---the reader inevitably asks why a particular change had been made.
