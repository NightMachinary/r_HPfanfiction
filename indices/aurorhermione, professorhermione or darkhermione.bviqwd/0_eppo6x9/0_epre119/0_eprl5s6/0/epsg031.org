Pretty interesting so far, but the author seems to be intent on making up problems out of nowhere. There's the whole gender inequality thing that has no basis in canon, and if we take Pottermore/interviews as canon, there was a muggleborn Minister of Magic in recent past. Nor had Lavender ever bullied Hermione, that we know of.
