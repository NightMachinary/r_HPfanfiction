Heh. It's strictly an amateur interpretation - I'm a DM who runs a game for a very... creatively insane group, so I try to prepare a lot of broad knowledge like this to react to whatever they choose to do (and yes, Door Hinges did come up). I'm probably wrong to anyone who actually knows anything about Door Hinges, but I'm close enough that I can shrug and pass it off as a layman understanding. :D

Ah. Damn. That's a bound door (see the metal running across the upper middle? It's essentially there to hold the wooden bits of the door together) and not an obviously t-hinged door. The hinges would be internally accessed then, not externally. Thus, impossible to remove the pins from the outside without some really creative magic use (maybe you can levitate them through whatever small gap might exist between the edge of the door and the doorjamb the hinge is pinned to?

The Hinges part of the below link is a pretty good explanation of what I was saying.
