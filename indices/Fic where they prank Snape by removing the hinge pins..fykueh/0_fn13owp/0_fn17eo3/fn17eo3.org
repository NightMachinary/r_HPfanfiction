I don't think they'd use modern hinges at all - they tend towards big old doors with the old castle two-layers of wood, so they'd probably end up with T-hinges and similar more than anything else, maybe an H-hinge if they upgraded sometime after the Statute. I can't find any pictures of any classroom door from the movies, so I can't say for certain, but it's my best guess for now. If they used a T or H hinge, they'd probably be visible on the outside, but it'd depend on where the hinge was placed and again, I can't say what the doors actually looked like until I dig out my copies of the movies. They'd probably go for a T-Hinge though - Iron was expensive back in the day and the longer hinge (if decorated, usually with a Fleur de Lis) was often a sign of wealth.

And hey, Rowling's work is full of plotholes, far bigger than the doors. She breaks her own rules so many times it's ridiculous. Just gotta Hakuna Matata your way out of it, fellow internet person. :)

And atm, what we use depends on the door you get. The manufacture can differ sometimes for different types of door and functions of doors (house front door, house back door, double-door for schools, double door for offices, etc). Also depends on what era your house was built in. The oldest house in Britain was built in 8500BC and we've only built more since then - and we haven't really kept styles consistent. :)
