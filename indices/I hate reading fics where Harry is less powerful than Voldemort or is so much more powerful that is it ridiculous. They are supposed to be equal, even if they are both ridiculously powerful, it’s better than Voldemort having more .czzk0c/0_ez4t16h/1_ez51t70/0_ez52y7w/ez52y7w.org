Yes, very similar to Tom Riddle in abilities and outward behaviors, but made a fundamentally different choice.

I would even let the Horcrux merge with him at certain stage, so he does get a power/skill boost, not to Voldemort Prime's level, but much stronger than he was in canon. Then, I would also let Ginny absorb Diary's power, and together they overthrow Voldemort Prime and clean up Magical Britain real good.

Being defeated by your own Horcruxes is the ultimate irony.
