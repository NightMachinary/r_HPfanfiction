“Being equal” has lots of different meanings, and it absolutely doesn't have to mean they are equal in destructive combat abilities!

In fact, the Prophecy itself is a con. It's at best self fulfilling. This one only gets set in motion because Voldemort chose to act on it and marked Harry in the process.

What you are basically saying is that you also hate reading canon Books, in which Harry is SIGNIFICANTLY weaker than Voldemort in a straight fight. Canon Harry is actually so weak, that he needs the 4 most powerful literary weapons, the Deus Ex Machina, the Author Fiat, the Plot Armor, and the Lucky Hero trope, to win a quite Pyrrhic victory.
