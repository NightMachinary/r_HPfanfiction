The thing about the prophecy is that is literally how every prophecy ends up playing out in stories/history/mythology. The act of giving the prophecy causes a ripple that creates the events necessary for it to occur. Herodotus records events like the soothsayer's prophecy to Croesus 2500+ years ago that ended up causing the thing the king was worried about anyway. The caveat to this is that anytime prophecies are ignored or cursed (see Cassandra for instance), they are always doomed to happen /because/ they didn't listen.

The odd question out is why? The existence of prophecy implies, in whatever context, someone is manipulating events to create a certain outcome that is desirable. In Greek Myth, this was the gods acting through intermediaries like the Delphic oracles. But in Harry Potter, who is trying to manipulate events there? And why?
