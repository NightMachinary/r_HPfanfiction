Ever since humanities gained consciousness (sentience or self awareness), we have been asking about the future. It's our basic instinctive fear of future uncertainties that gave rise to the prophecy industry.

The literary world is especially infatuated with prophecies. We are now in 21st century, and every sci-fi or fantasy flick has a prophecy. It doesn't matter whether it's in a Galaxy Far Far Away, in Middle Earth, in the cyberpunk Matrix simulation, or in some other lost realms of nowhere. Don't people get tired of it?

At least in HBP, JKR made Dumbledore say that prophecies are at best self fulfilling.

I really want to read fics that completely and totally shit on prophecies.
