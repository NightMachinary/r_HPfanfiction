True.

But we shanghaied the thread to talk about how powerful to make Harry in a fic.

Canon is great. Easily my favorite book series. But Harry was a lazy, overly idealistic bastard in an attempt to keep the later books kid friendly with adult themes.

I personally think prophecies are all about interpretation. You can interpret it any way, but I think the best fanfiction treat Harry as a mirror of Tom Riddle.
