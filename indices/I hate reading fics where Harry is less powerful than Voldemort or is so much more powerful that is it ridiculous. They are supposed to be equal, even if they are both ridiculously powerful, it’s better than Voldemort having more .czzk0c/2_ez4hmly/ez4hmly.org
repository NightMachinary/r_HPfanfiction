But in canon, Harry is weaker than Voldemort.

The prophecy is quite specific on these points:

- Harry has some 'power' that Voldemort doesn't understand

- Harry has the power to defeat Voldemort. (Not necessarily the same as the first power.)

- Voldemort shall 'mark' him as his equal.

This does *not* imply that:

- Harry has to be equal to Voldemort in skill

- Harry has to be powerful

- Harry has to be Voldemort's equal in any way at all really. Voldemort targeting him as a baby is sufficient.
