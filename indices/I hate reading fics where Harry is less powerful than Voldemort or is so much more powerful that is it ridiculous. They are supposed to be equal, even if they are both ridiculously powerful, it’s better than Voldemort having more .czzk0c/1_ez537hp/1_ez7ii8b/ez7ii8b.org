In terms of raw power, whatever that means in the Harry Potter setting, they should be roughly equal pound for pound. Remember Harry clearing a field of Dementors in third year and keeping the Priori Incantatem up against Voldemort in the fourth year.

In terms of skill, knowledge and plain all-around deadliness it should definitely shift far into voldemort's favour.
