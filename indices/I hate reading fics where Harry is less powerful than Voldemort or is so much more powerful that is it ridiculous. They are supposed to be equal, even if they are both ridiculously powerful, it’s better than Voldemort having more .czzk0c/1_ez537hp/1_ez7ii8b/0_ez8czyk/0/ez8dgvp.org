You're not saying anything I disagree with. All I mean is that if Harry (or the plot) manages to corral Voldemort into a confrontation where only raw power matters (like the Priori Incantatem in GoF) then it wouldn't be unrealistic for Harry to be able to match him. A (normal) duel is obviously not that confontation.
