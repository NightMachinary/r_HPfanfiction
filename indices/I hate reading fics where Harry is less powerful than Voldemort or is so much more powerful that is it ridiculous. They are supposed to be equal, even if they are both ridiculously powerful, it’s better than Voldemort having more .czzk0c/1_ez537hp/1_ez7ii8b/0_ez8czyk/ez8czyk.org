Raw power means nothing. Even if you would equalise them, Harry cannot utilise that power because he lacks the decades of experience. Voldemort has been a menace before Harry's parents were born.

Kinda like the difference between a 200 W laser and an old 200 W light bulb. One will permanently fuck you up, the other is pleasantly warm and bright. Or a purpose built hybrid racecar with 1500 kW and someone who squeezed the same amount of power out of a Honda Civic. The power might be equal on paper, but only one of those can actually utilise it.
