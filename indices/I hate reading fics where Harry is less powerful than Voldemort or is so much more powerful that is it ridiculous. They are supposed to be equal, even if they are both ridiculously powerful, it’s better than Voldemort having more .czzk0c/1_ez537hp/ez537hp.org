Harry being able to match Voldemort feels like an asspull to me since it makes no sense that a 14/16 or 17-year-old boy with no proper combat training would be able to stand against the worst serial killer in the magical world, who is also on top of the skill pyramid (with Dumbledore and presumably Grindelwald).

Even the prophecy mentions a power Voldemort does not know, which canonically is love as in "the love to lay down your life for another" (which then starts some ex-Machina logic chain). Obviously, there are different possible interpretations, with anything from memory wiping to a sniper bullet from 400 yards or stabbing while asleep fitting "the power he knows not", but given that Voldemort seems to be all brute force, that is not something Voldemort would not know.
