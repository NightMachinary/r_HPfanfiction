As an adult, that ending sucks. I freely acknowledge that sometimes, people have to die so that others might live. But not in the way Harry walked to his death.

Have him go down Leonidas style, fighting an impossible battle against overwhelming odds, or use the stealthy approach. He walks past several Death Eaters whom he could have killed from under his cloak to the even the odds. Or have him and a few others fight Voldemort in a delaying action like the Finnish did against the Soviets in 39 and die during that. Between Hagrid and Lupin, they ought to have the superior knowledge of the terrain.
