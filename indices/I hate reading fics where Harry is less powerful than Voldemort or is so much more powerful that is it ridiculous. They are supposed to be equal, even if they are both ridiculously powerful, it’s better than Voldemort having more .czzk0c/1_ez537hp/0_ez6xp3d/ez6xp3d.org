I actually like the ending as an adult, although I do feel the whole moral dilemma Harry has about killing in book 7 should have been dropped.

Harry should be at best an equal to school age Tom Riddle with different choices. Any further makes any side character a miniscule threat.

I also prefer stories with a competent Voldemort. Someone who is so powerful, an Elder Wand wielding Dumbledore can hope for a stalemate at best.
