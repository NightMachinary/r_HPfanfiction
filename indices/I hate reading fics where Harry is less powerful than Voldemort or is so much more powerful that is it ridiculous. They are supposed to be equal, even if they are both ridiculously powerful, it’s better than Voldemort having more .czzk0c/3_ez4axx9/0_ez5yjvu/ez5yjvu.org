Wind Shear linkffn(Wind Shear) I think does this really well. It has 21 year old Harry as a combat match for Voldemort. But, Harry mostly uses simple spells in innovative ways his opponents aren't prepared for. The first fight shown has Harry wipe the floor with proto-Death Eaters using a bottle of whiskey, an Incendio, banishing and summoning charms and an animation charm. Only the animation charm is something a 5th year Harry wouldn't have access to. And he's even shown practicing it later, stating he has trouble with animating water.
