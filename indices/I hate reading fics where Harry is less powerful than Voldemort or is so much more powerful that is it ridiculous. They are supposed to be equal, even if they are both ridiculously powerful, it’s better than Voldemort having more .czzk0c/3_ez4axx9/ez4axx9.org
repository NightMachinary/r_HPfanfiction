What most people muck up IMO, is the difference between skill and power. Voldemort has about 40 years of knowledge more than Harry. Which means he should be loads more skillful. Where people go wrong in making a strong Harry is not power, but how he acquires the skill to wield it. Because canon Harry is strong, a patronus as a third year when he is already exhausted. Or the battle for power between Voldemort and Harry when their wands connect. What most fics does is that he suddenly can do magic three years beyond his skill. Like a fourth year that start conjuring. We see that Harry is a prodigy in Defense and that is the explanation behind the patronus. But a lot of fics makes him a master wizard without even trying.
