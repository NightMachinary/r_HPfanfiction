Imagine if Ron was the one to be chosen. I don't even care how realistic that would be, I'd want a fic about this. And as we know nothing about ravenclaws and very little about hufflepuffs in Harry's year, I'll assume those students wouldn't be good enough. But maybe I'd want to see Draco get a burn from that dragon.
