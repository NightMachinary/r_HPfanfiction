My prediction (largely cribbed from canon):

  The fire in the Goblet had just turned red again. Sparks were flying out of it. A long flame shot suddenly into the air, and borne upon it was another piece of parchment.

  Automatically, it seemed, Dumbledore reached out a long hand and seized the parchment. He held it out and stared at the name written upon it. There was a long pause, during which Dumbledore stared at the slip in his hands, and everyone in the room stared at Dumbledore. And then Dumbledore cleared his throat, and read out --

  â€˜Hermione Granger.'

If the whole 4th year had gotten tossed in, it would probably be a toss-up between Harry (best action hero) and Hermione (best at magic). If Harry is excluded, then it's going to be a (very surprised) Hermione, who is probably going to be dealing with murder attempts for the rest of the year.

The most popular fic with Hermione as a Triwizard champion is /Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire/ by Couldson Eagle. In it, though, she casts a protective spell on Harry that essentially redirects the Goblet's magic at her. The fic was generally good, but it had issues as well: 1) the Muggle Law plot threads that took up what felt like a third of the fic and led nowhere, 2) Hermione did not outright /win/ enough, and 3) it had an atrocious Idiot Ball fixfic ending.

Are there any other decent fics with this premise?
