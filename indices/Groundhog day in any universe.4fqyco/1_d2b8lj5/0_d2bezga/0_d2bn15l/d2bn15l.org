If anyone's interested, there's a DLP review thread on this story [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=23703][here.]]

My own review is [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showpost.php?p=905354&postcount=539][here]]. To quote parts of it:

  The short of it: It's good, fun, and rather interesting. It's really enjoyable having our knowledge of the world slowly built up as the protagonist learns more and more about the world he lives in, and doubly enjoyable to watch the mystery of the circumstances around the time loop slowly unfold.

  ... it's the kind of story that sucks you in and makes you neglect the rest of your life until you've finished reading.
