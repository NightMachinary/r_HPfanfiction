Omg every shit “Harry trains in a time dilation” fic our there. Harry learns all these spells, he learns sword fighting, he learns super rare battle mage magic. And then the big fight comes and he uses a couple reductos or whatever and the fights over literally never uses anything that is talked about in the training just uses the simple basic 4th year spells he learns in cannon. Even the well written versions of this trope have the same problem. Also the whole he learns how to wield a katana but then never uses it like why even add that there's a sword already included in cannon just have him carry that around and never use it and you get the same effect.
