  It was not about the sex but the social pressure, imagined or not.

That's my point though. That social pressure does not exist. Not in any meaningful way outside what already exists normally with dating. Frankly it would have been more powerful if there was someone actually interested in Harry just as a normal person and that caused issues.

It also doesn't work when it's built up like that with the slutty clothes and hypersexual society. It makes no sense. Like an orgy would happen regularly if only because people are told it does, it's like in school when people have sex because they think everyone else is except here everyone else actually is.
