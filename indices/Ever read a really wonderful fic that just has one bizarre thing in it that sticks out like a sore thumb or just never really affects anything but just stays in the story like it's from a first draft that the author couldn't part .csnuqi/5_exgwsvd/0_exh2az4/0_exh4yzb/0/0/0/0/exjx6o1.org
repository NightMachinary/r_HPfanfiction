Some people will have orgies. But it's not everyone - which was the hype.

I'd say the exact lack of any pressure or awkward turning down of other students does show that it's consensual and safe - as Sirius and Remus explained. And the kids don't all think otherwise - Pansy and her friends very clearly are aware that there's no social pressure to sleep with someone who asks. The ones who had issues were mainly Harry and Hermione, because of their upbringing.

And yes, it's not as blunt as you'd like.
