The point of the Year of exploration was that it was just hype. Something uninformed teenagers build up in their hormone-influenced minds when in reality, it is something far more tame and sane (for most). As Sirius and Remus explained to the couple once they got around to ask. A red herring, not a plot point. Foreshadowed by the rumours the other schools had heatd about it which Harry and Hermione set straight when Fleur and Victor told them about it.
