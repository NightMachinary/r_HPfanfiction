  Decent story around it like, Hermione definitely kills Voldemort though and no real explanation is given for why the Prophecy wasn't relevant even though it exists.

Same answer as every other Hermione beats Voldemort story.

  Prophecy shmophecy. Either the Triwizard Tournament was the Power He Knew Not (it led to the the destruction of the Horcruxes, after all) or Hermione was. Or Trelawney was using "he" as the English neutral pronoun, the Grangers had a shotgun marriage two months into pregnancy, and Hermione Jane Granger came squalling into the world at the end of seven months of marriage. Or, or, or. The most fabulous thing about prophecies is that any chain of events leading to their fulfillment becomes, retroactively, the One True Interpretation.
