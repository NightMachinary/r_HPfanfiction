Marks as his equal is the real kicker of it though.

No story that uses an alternative interpretation with different characters really does it well.

I have different issues with a couple of Starfox5 fics (I do appreciate the frequent change in narrative and the well-written ensemble cast though), but The Marriage Law Revolution is easily my favorite.
