This is very common in stories that are published in serial fashion. People may build up points and characters or come up with ideas that drop out of the narrative as they start focusing on something else.

In order to fix stuff like this, one would have to go back and re-edit the entire story from beginning to end. Most people once they finish a story on FFN aren't willing to go back and do that.

Case in point: SPEW, the entire classes of herbology and astronomy, Aunt Marge, Piers Polkiss, Fluffy and really the entire third floor Corridor. All of these were relevant in precisely one book.
