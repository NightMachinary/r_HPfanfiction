Some things are just there to be background and make a story feel complete. I'm mildly amused at the thought of a long series where /everything/ has to matter deeply, or the opposite, where the author won't even name or describe something if it isn't super relevant to the main point of the plot. Imagine if we got like four core classes and then "his other classes" and "the other teachers" for the entire seven years.

I think what the OP means is when something is specifically said to be integral to a later part of plot (which none of those things were, they fulfilled their function within the space they were given) and then dropped.
