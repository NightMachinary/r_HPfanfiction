  All of these were relevant in precisely one book.

To be fair that's an incredibly common Children's Book trope rather than a major plot point of the entire series. In Patron it would be like if they stopped Sorting around The Half Blood Prince. It's a /huge/ part of the entire story that just...doesn't happen for some reason.

  In order to fix stuff like this, one would have to go back and re-edit the entire story from beginning to end. Most people once they finish a story on FFN aren't willing to go back and do that.

Yeah that's what I meant by appreciating editors more now.
