I don't want to open the can of worms (lmaooo) but I do personally believe Pansy's insult came from a place of ignorance and ethnocentrism, and if you don't call it racism, it's at the very least some flavor of xenophobia-based intolerance.

Why did Pansy insult Angelina's hair? Because it looked different. Would she have insulted Angelina had Angelina worn her hair in a straightened, or as they call it in the hairdressing world, "relaxed" hair? Probably not.

Idk, but I just don't how someone, past the age of 10 years old, can look at a black person with cornrow-braided hair, make a deliberate insult comparing its appearance to worms, and have it not be a racist thing.
