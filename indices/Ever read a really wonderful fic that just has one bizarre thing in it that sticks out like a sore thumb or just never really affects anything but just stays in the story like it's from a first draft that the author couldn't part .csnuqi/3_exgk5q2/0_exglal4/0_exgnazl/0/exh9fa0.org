Harry Potter as a series very specifically avoids any real world racial or class issues with Blood Purity as the stand in for all of it. The entire point is that there's no real world discrimination so that all kids from all backgrounds can read it and learn why discrimination off things you can't control are irrelevant.

There's absolutely no way JK would put that in as a racial thing. Also in the UK in general people are less overtly racist like that, I just think it's an insult and one I could definitely see kids using because she has weird, to them, hair rather than an attack on her race. Frankly i'd be more confused by it being a racially motivated thing.
