One of the bizarrest things I've read in fanfic was from the Serpensortia series linkao3(4913998). It's a well-written fic with lots of thought put into the characters and personalities, but then the weirdness steps in.

In an alternative sorting AU, Harry is put into Slytherin and makes friends with Draco and Adrian Pucey, the Slytherin quidditch team Chaser. The weird part comes up when Adrian, for no explanation at all, turns out to be an Asian girl the whole time, and no one in Slytherin bats an eye at it. Her mother was a Chinese Death Eater, she lives with her very Asian auntie who berates her on her grades, and everyone in the story accepts her existence as normal and nothing out of the ordinary. Which I couldn't suspend my disbelief over, because the defining point of Slytherin House is that they're prejudiced. And in canon, it's not just against blood, but they're sexist and /racist/ racist too.

  Angelina, Alicia and Katie had come over, too. There were no girls on the Slytherin team---who stood, shoulder to shoulder, facing the Gryffindors, leering to a man.

  "Hey, Johnson, what's with that hairstyle, anyway?" shrieked Pansy Parkinson from below. "Why would anyone want to look like they've got worms coming out of their head?"

It felt like an obvious OC (donut steel plz) shoehorned into a canon character's place, and it didn't work for me. It was as jarring as one of this fics where Draco (or whoever) comes out as part-Veela and needs to mate with Harry to fulfill his special Veela soulbond, and everyone within the narrative accepts it as a normal part of worldbuilding.
