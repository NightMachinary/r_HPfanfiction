I'm not the biggest fan of it, but there are a few stories that make it work. Paradigm Shift has already been mentioned and does quite a good job of keeping everyone in character. [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7700/1][Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire]] also justifies it well, and has an interesting exploration of Hermione dealing with the Triwizard Tournament wearing much less plot armour than Harry did (she survives, but with many more injuries).
