Probably not. I doubt even Hermione's Ministry would allow that, though it's debatable. Hermione might feel a sense of wanting to help the Muggles out there (especially in times of COVID), but then she'll probably realise that there's always the risk of the potions being analysed by scientists.

At some point, things might not add up in the lab, which would cause further investigation over time. These 'miracle cures' could very well end up being far more trouble to the Ministry than they're worth. It would be a nightmare to cover up their tracks in order to allow the potions to pass all the Muggle reviews and regulations out there.

Head Auror Harry would have his hands full trying to investigate and apprehend these conspirators.

If you asked me, I'd guess that some wizards (particularly Muggle-Borns) might discreetly issue the tonic to protect their own Muggle families and close Muggle-friends (probably without the latter's knowledge), and that's it. Strangers would be left out in the cold with regards to getting potions.
