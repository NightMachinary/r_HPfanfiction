You underestimate the cunning of the Granger administration:

First, they released a children's series called Harry Potter, in which they glorified themselves and bashed their enemies into oblivion. Now that millions know about Harry Potter and that many Muggles like to flash Wands in the public, true Wizards have become a lot safer among them. Even if they occasionally cast some spells, Muggles won't take them for real! Furthermore, they made billions off those gullible Muggles.

As for how those billions could be deployed, they can exchange them into Galleons at reasonably favorable rate. They can buy real physical gold (and other precious metals). But most importantly, they can make strategic investments to further ensure the long term survival of the Magical Species.

For example, the end of the Cold War forced Muggle governments to downsize their militaries and sell off old military bases at bargain prices. They can acquire those valuable real estate cheaply and turn them into Wizard only enclaves. These are often very defendable sites with great existing infrastructure. Even better, cordoning these sites off from Muggles will not arouse a lot of suspicions.

To counter Muggles' rapid technological advances that could present a real threat to the SoS, the new British Ministry of Magic is preparing to come out into open, on their own terms. The release of the HP Series was merely a first step to test Muggles' reaction to the concept of magic. Needless to say, the results vastly exceeded their most optimistic expectations.

Their next step will be to further expand their presence in the Muggle world. They will partner with biotech and pharmaceutical companies to release lifesaving drugs. They will partner with visionary Muggle entrepreneurs to develop something really cool, such as a colony on Mars. They will go after their Muggle enemies in the media, and will try to turn their children against them. Through all this, they will apply their magic as a key competitive advantage.

When they eventually come out, the Muggle world should see them as a benevolent force and be highly dependent on. Of course, they will also hedge their bets:

- Their space program could provide them with an extraterrestrial refuge should their â€˜coming out effort' fail.
- Their secret enclaves could provide them with additional safety.
