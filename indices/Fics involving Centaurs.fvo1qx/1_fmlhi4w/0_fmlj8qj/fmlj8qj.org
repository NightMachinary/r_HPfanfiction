Yeah. Apparently the way I formatted my series of posts was technically spamming, since they could've all been done in one post.

And true, but so many of those have bugger all actual centaur culture/society in them. It's just the canon-esque "We look at the stars and they're some vague verb that sounds foreboding" approach and I'm looking for something with a little more than that.
