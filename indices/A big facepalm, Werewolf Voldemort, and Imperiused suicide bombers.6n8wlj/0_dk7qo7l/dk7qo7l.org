Voldemort extensively used Imperiused suicide bombers in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5435295/1/The-Bonds-of-Blood][The Bonds of Blood]], linkffn(5435295)

Imperiused bombers or memory charmed saboteurs were a common tactic in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185).

Ron and Hermione used this tactic a few times in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(10595005).

Imperiused suicide attackers were not too effective in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divide and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994), because of various countermeasures taken (Thief's Downfall in all strategic important locations, checkpoints, disillusioned Broom sentries). But both sides nevertheless used them.
