Hermione and Harry are not likable in that story, but then again, even the author calls them "fucked up child soldiers". What they ranted at McGonagall and Dumbledore's portrait is not necessarily correct, merely a progression of their character developments.

But once you get past the first 3 chapters, the story takes a turn for the better, and by chapter 9, it's getting really interesting.
