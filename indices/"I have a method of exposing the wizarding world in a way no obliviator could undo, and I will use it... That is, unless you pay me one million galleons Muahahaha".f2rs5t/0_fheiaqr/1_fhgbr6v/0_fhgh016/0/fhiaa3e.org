A bunch of wizards flying through the stadium in the middle of the Super Bowl would probably work. They could wear invisibility cloaks and only take them off when they're in the stadium to prevent other wizards from stopping them. Too many direct witnesses (hundreds of thousands) to obliviate quickly and millions of people who saw it on TV.
