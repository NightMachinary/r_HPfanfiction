The last part was shouted out loud, and the Hat was removed after a moment and there was silence...

Crap, had he done something wrong, was that house seen that badly...

Suddenly the Slytherin table exploded in cheers, they went really wild, it shocked Harry.

"We got Potter, /Potter/!"

The other tables started clapping too, but some people were really confused, and throwing glances at the people on the Gryffindor table, who were clapping, but looking to be in shock.

Wow, they really had him pegged for it, he hoped that wouldn't cause trouble, at least not big trouble.

Professor McGonagall gave him a little push and he went, he had to really hold himself to smile and not to flinch when he was /swarmed/ by well-wishers wanting to shake his hand, some looked weird, as if relieved.

"All right people, let the guy breathe, hello there, Mr. Potter, I am Cassius Warrington, Prefect of Slytherin House, welcome to our house, let me sit you with the other students in your year."

Soon he was sat beside Draco, who looked to be over the moon, and proud, very proud.

"Awesome Harry, I knew you would be here, let me introduce you to some of my friends."

He was introduced to Crabbe and Goyle, who were big, and didn't seem to be very smart, but followed Draco. Bodyguards then. Lovely.

Then Pansy Parkinson who looked torn between being confused by his reception and trying to be diplomatic.

Blaise Zabini, that guy had look Harry sometimes saw in the mirror, of determination, but then he placed a much better practiced smile than Harry's and greeted him warmly. That one would bear watching.

Then Daphne Greengrass, a pretty girl who looked Harry over, nodded and greeted him formally. Apparently it had been a good idea to splurge on robes, or she had seen something else, he would need to learn how to deal with girls.

Tracy Davis seemed to be the most normal of the group, shaking his hand and saying she was happy he was there. It was either a very good act, or she was truly like that, good, he liked honesty in others.

The others he would have to remember later, but he was impressed at how good it was to be well received.

It was a good start.

Harry later learned his Head of House, one Professor Snape, who also taught Potions, disliked him, but was content in being formal, if only a bit caustic, he could deal with that.

Some people in the House weren't happy, by their glances at him, but they were far fewer than he expected, if he counted by those he could perceive at least.

Harry then received the best bed he had ever seen, he would have to share a dorm with the other boys, but they seemed ok with it.

They also asked questions, lots of them, uncomfortable questions, so Harry decided to use something he saw people use, make people speak of themselves or what they knew and make them forget their questions.

"Er, I really don't know how to answer that, I was raised by /muggles./" he tried to inject the same inflection he had heard his housemates used with that word.

It worked, because they scowled, "What! why?"

"Security." he deflected, ignoring Blaise snorting, "So, er, there are some things I don't know, maybe you guys could help me?"

Draco's eyes shone.

It took less than a full day at Hogwarts to realize the Wizarding World worked similarly to the Muggle One, only with magic.

Money and Power, and the influence they bought, ruled. Only that it was much more clear that people with money and influence ruled.

Also, to some people blood was important too, Harry learned he was considered a half-blood, because his mother was Muggleborn, and to some people this was bad, because they didn't talk too much about it with him, but seemed to be holding themselves.

So, a form of racism, only weirder, apparently his name, fame, and money, /compensated/ for that, assholes.

And Magical Power was important too, very important, sometimes it compensated for a lot of things, the Headmaster, Dumbledore, not from a rich family, and a half-blood, was very important, and had a lot, a /lot,/ of political power because he had beaten a very powerful and scary guy all the way back in 1945. He was also considered one of the most magically powerful Wizards alive. Even some of Harry's housemates(including Draco) who disliked him still admitted he was not to be trifled with.

Harry needed to learn and practice magic then, because this is the kind of power he needed, he knew fame could turn both ways, especially in Britain, and that he wasn't the richest guy around, so he needed to get an advantage with magical power.

No one would ever hurt him again.

School however, seemed to be, a bit slow, his first Charm class, was about the levitation spell, the one Harry had learned in the train. He had to really work himself up and remember his stupid aunt wouldn't know if he did well, and he would be out of her house soon anyway.

So he demonstrated the spell, on the first try.

It was the right thing to do.

"Oh, splendid, Mr. Potter, splendid, 10 points to Slytherin."

Draco looked surprised, but /smiled, "/Brilliant, Harry!" he then looked confused and whispered, frowning a bit, "I thought you said Muggles raised you."

Shit.

"I learned this on the train, it's in the second chapter and looked useful."

Draco's eyes widened, and he just nodded.

Harry decided to tone down a bit until the first months were over, he didn't want to overdo it and call too much attention.

Harry learned that being on Draco's "group" had it's pros and cons, they were just regular kids, only with magic, well, most were, he had his suspicions with Blaise. The problem was that Draco liked to be a bully, and Harry had no idea how to avoid that, he didn't know what to say. Draco especially liked to bully people due to money. Apparently blood too, but he would glance at Harry and stop himself.

Which left money, and one of his targets was some boy from Gryffindor called Ron Weasley, who according to Draco came from an old family, but they were 'Blood Traitors' and poor, and that made them bad, for some reason.

It ticked Harry off because he still considered himself poor, even if he had a fortune(he would need to write the Bank and ask for a statement.)

So, Harry decided to use the age-old excuse of studying, except he really went to study, and he talked with Tracy and Daphne too, who talked with Pansy, but didn't seem to like her very much, and Pansy didn't seem to like Tracy, but talked with her. Girls were weird.

He tried to be present in the group, and he was glad he didn't need much effort because Draco spoke enough for everyone, he only agreed or made noncommittal noises. He also used the opportunity to learn a lot, even if he realized many things were biased, Draco was well-read and knew magic and especially Potions, like the son of a noble, and liked to teach Harry, if only a bit patronizingly, but he could deal with that.

Harry preferred the clinical way that Daphne explained with, it was comfortable being around her because he didn't feel the pressure to /act/, or start conversations, they just sat down, studied, and talked about coursework or magical trivia. Tracy was harder, but he guessed it was good practice.
