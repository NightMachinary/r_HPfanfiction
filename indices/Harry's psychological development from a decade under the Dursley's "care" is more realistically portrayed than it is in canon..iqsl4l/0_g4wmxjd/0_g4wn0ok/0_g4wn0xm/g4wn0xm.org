Harry learned to what to say to make people happy, when to smile, when to laugh, even if he didn't think it was funny.

He sometimes was disgusted at himself, but it was all for a goal, and he was learning, and learning fast, one thing he made sure he knew how to do well, was read and write, Dudley had plenty of material for both he left abandoned, and his aunt didn't notice Harry hadn't thrown the Caligraphy books away.

And Harry was surprised at how good it was being recognized for good work, he tried to write good essays, and he practiced magic a lot, sometimes well into the night when he could(he wasn't used to sleeping much).

And it showed, the only student who did better than him was the girl he met in the train, one Hermione Granger. Who seemed to study just as hard or even harder than him, her written and theoretical work was without peer, but Harry could match and sometimes even surpass her with the practical applications. Professor Flitwick said he was gifted.

He had been really relieved, and just more determined.

Harry then learned about Quidditch, the most famous sport in the Wizarding World, he wasn't a sports guy, scrawny and always chosen last. But one thing he learned is that people liked to talk about sports, so he read about it, and learned they didn't have Tellies to watch games but heard them through some kind of radio called a Wireless. It was a good way to have things to talk about.

And he learned he wasn't a bad flier, the lesson was a breeze, so much he was approved in the class after it, and Madam Hooch, along with Draco, said he may have a talent for Quidditch. Which was a big surprise. Draco also bullied a Gryffindor guy, Longbottom, and tried to take something from him, only for a group of Gryffindors to try and stop him, Harry really didn't want to find to defend a bully, but he would have to do something.

Thankfully they kept posturing for long enough for a teacher to show up and take the glass ball away after they started shouting. Harry wondered what he would have done if a fight had broken out, he never had that much sucess with his fists.

His Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor wasn't good at all, he stuttered and seemed to be afraid of his own shadow, and Harry felt really weird in his class.

So, self-study then, he learned from one of the older students he could order books, so he went against his instincts and asked Professor Quirell for recommendations, at least he could say he went to a teacher when he went and just bought dueling manuals.

Boy, was he surprised when Quirell recommended some really good books, and pointed him towards Professor Flitwick, who had been a /dueling champion./

Professor Flitwick smiled when Harry asked about dueling, saying he was too young but did recommend him beginner books and manuals 'so you have a good start'.

Hedwig came back with two other owls and a lot of books.

"Harry, are you sure you aren't a Ravenclaw?"

Harry shrugged, so interested in the books he spoke distractedly "The Hat offered that too, but said I would fit better in Slytherin, it would put me on the way to greatness."

He didn't notice the raised eyebrows, or whispers that emerged when he said that.

In the Halloween, where Harry tried to forget about his parents and enjoy the night, mostly by eating a lot of candy, he had never had many chances before, so he the best with what he could.

It was all interrupted when Professor Quirell ran into the Great Hall screaming about a Troll, he then fainted. Typical.

After the initial bout of panic, where Harry learned Draco screamed like a girl, they were ordered to go back to their dorms.

Harry then frowned and said, "Isn't that where the Troll is? The Dungeons?"

That was the wrong thing to say becaue Draco screamed again and Cassius came over and Harry said that to him, he spoke with Snape, and the teachers spoke amongst themselves, and decided to keep them in the Great Hall, some teachers left, and Professor Flitiwick cast a spell on the Great Halls door that made them flash golden and lock themselves.

If they could seal doors like that why move lots of children through the castle instead of just reinforcing the door.

Some students were crying, others couldn't eat, Harry who was used to eating while distressed wasn't going to waste the opportunity, many in his table followed him.

After an hour the teachers returned, they looked a bit worried, but still relieved, Dumbledore said the Troll had been dealt with, and they could go back to their dorms.

Harry spent the whole way hearing Draco go on and on about how he was going to tell his father and how Dumbledore was incompetent, and how could a Troll get inside one of the safest buildings in Britain.

Harry wanted to know too, maybe Quirell was involved, but honestly, he already had too much on his plate.

â€‹

The other day he learned through Pansy that the Troll had injured two students, among them that 'know it-all M-/Muggleborn'/ ah, the racism again, at least they didn't do it in his face. He hoped the girl was well, she didn't seem be as nonsensical as some of the others. But by what Pansy said it wasn't bad and she would be out of the Hospital Wing in a week or so.

I am going to end it here, boring I know, and I stopped before some of his big issues came forward, this is already too long, basically I see Harry would be withdrawn, lack social skills, and try to fit in, kind of like a social camaleon, I also see him as very jaded. And not interested in looking for trouble, with a determination to never be hurt again.

He would be the guy that stayed quiet in the background, and Draco would be good for that because he seems like the guy who likes to talk a lot.

You can see ignores much of what happens around him, and doesn't care for other stuff(the announcement about the Third Floor corridor) this is because he is almost full time focusing on his act.

Harry's anger and hatred would be significant, but by this point he would have suffered enough to internalize them and become a bit cynical and uncaring in the process, going forward he would become more confident and get out of his shell more, his anger issues would come forward after the luster from the new world faded a bit, and people got used to having him around and would not be so afraid to approach him. He's also eleven and some of those issues become more glaring when people get older.

I see him as having sometimes an explosive anger, when things didn't go his way, but being able to bear with it most of the time, and having trust and self esteem issues. This Harry is practically playing a role right now, because he had som much positive things(magic, money, fame, being treated well) that he felt a bit more confident acting without some of the burden of his childhood, almost like when you change places it feels like a fresh start.

When Draco grows up a bit and wanted to up his game of bullying, and got more confident, issues may arise, or Harry would just ignore it.

Events would force Harry to come to the forefront, and this would make him even more desperate for power, Second Year would solidify his Slytherin position(he would not involve himself with the Philosopher's Stone), and he would start to see people villanize him, making him isolate further and seek those who supported him.
