Well, here's my version of what I think a more realistic Harry would be, given his canon treatment and what we see of his personality. I think he would learn to not be so external with his defiance, would internalize a lot of anger, and lack people skills.

Hogwarts was wonderful, Harry thought, like it was out of one of the fantasy novels Dudley had left in his "second" bedroom.

That brought a spike of anger in Harry, the memory of that, of all they put him through, a cupboard while there was an unused bedroom, only the scraps when he himself had to cook.

He /hated/ them, and hated himself for being weak, he had a plan to leave as soon as he was able, he would rather live on the streets that stay like that, he never adapted to what they wanted, being meek, submissive, it just wasn't him, after Vernon tried to beat it into him, he learned to be quiet, but every word he didn't speak, every reaction he stopped, it became anger, an anger so deep it scared him sometimes.

And then he learned he was a Wizard, that his parents had loved him, and that he had /magic/, and that's one of the reasons they hated him so.

It only made him hate them more.

He read about magic, what one could do with it, it was marvelous, it was power, it was /freedom./

/"Magic will set me free."/ He repeated that, it had become his mantra, his hope, but for that to happen, he needed to learn, and Harry had never had the opportunity to actually study properly, his aunt didn't like when he outdid his stupid cousin in school, so Harry purposely did average or bad, while trying to learn what he would need to get a job.

But now, it was a whole new world, and his relatives weren't there.

When he received his wand, it was one of the most freeing and even happy moments he ever had, because it confirmed he was Wizard, that he had magic, and that he wasn't /them./

And now he had money, lots of it by the look of things, his family was old, and apparently he was famous too, really famous, fat lot of good that did him.

But now he could use those things, he saw the news, famous people could open doors that would stay closed for most, and having money helped a lot too.

And Harry would use that. He also bought every book that seemed useful, the bookshop worker was very helpful when he asked him about the best books to learn spells from, and even magical fighting, which was also known as dueling.

Hagrid told him he didn't need all that, that the list was enough, but he was ignored.

Harry had read almost the whole ride, he had been trying basic spells when a girl looking for a lost toad appeared, she saw him do the levitation spell, and then repaired his glasses, he then thanked her and continued reading, she left soon after.

The boat ride had been great, and on the door he met a blond boy who said he could guide him to meet the right sorts of people.

Harry was a lonely kid, so he had lots of time to watch people, he sometimes left their house to go to the park and watch people interact, it was painful to watch happy families, but he learned things too. How a smile made people trust you more and not feel threatened, how to speak to get things, he used some of that on /them/ and it worked somewhat.

He also learned how to identify certain types of people.

Like this kid, for example, his clothes were brand new, his accent and forced poise indicated a rich background, as did the way he looked at people, judging them.

Harry guessed he was also not that brave, but that was just a guess.

But the guy was rich, and probably had connections, the way spoke his surname also implied it was from an important family. These were the guys who held power.

Bad people to antagonize, even if Harry thought he would be annoying, and a bully, but he was treating Harry as an "equal", so he saw an opportunity.

He put on his quiet smile, and shook the guy's hand, he had little idea how to talk to a kid his age, with adults quiet and polite worked almost all the time, so he went with what he had.

"Hello, er, Draco, can I call you Draco? You can call me Harry. If that's okay?

The boy smiled, as if he won the lottery, jeez so even rich people thought him famous, he really had to learn to use that.

"Of course you can, Harry, I think we will be great friends."

Harry quickly went back to what he learned of conversations, so he could ask about his family, he remembered reading about old families and rich people /loved/ to talk about family.

"So, Draco, Malfoy, that's an old family, right?" It was a bad question, but it looked like the guy was waiting for it, because he began to regale Harry with his whole bloody family history.

And the Malfoy family is old, really old, like Willian The Conqueror gave us lands and we still have them, old. And his father was a politician who spoke with the Minister.

This Draco guy was the definition of old money, so Harry had hit the jackpot, and old money knew old money.

"That's great, Draco, I don't know much about my family, but I am told they are old too."

And Draco told him, after Harry made an excuse about living with relatives who didn't know much so he could be hidden, but Draco loved to hear himself speaking so he told him that the Potter name was old too, like more than six centuries old and he was related to some bigshots Peverells who were kind of legends.

Crap. He really needed to get himself a family tree.

Soon, it was time to enter the hall, and Draco said that Harry would fit right in Slytherin, which Harry guessed was the old money House. He had read about it, /ambition/ /and cunning,/ one Harry had in spades and the other he had a need of. Hagrid had said something about evil Wizards being in it, but it sounded more like when someone talked bad stuff about politicians.

Yeah, Voldemort had been there, but so did /Merlin/ apparently, and lots of important people according to a book.

If his 'relatives' had taught Harry anything with the way they acted, is that you needed to know influential people to be influential.

Harry resented his lot in life up until now, but apparently it had given him the tools to succeed and opportunities definitely weren't lacking.

Soon his name was called, after Draco, to the surprise of no one, had gone into Slytherin, and that girl from the train to Gryffindor, his parent's House, and House of the Brave, they seemed nice, but, not what he needed right now.

He sat in the stool and the Hat was placed, and then it /spoke/.

"Ah, Mr. Potter, I...,oh, well, you selection is different that I thought..."

Harry sighed, "Is that bad?" apparently the Hat could read minds.

"Not at all, I am not here to judge, only to place you in the House that fits you better, and I find two Houses would be good for you, and you seem pretty determined, so you can choose."

"It's not Slytherin and Gryffindor, right?"

"What? Oh, no! You are brave, yes, but...not in the way of Gryffindor, I am talking about Ravenclaw, and Slytherin."

"Ravenclaw?"

"Yes, there you will be able to get the knowledge you want so much, it's the House of learners and scholars..."

"What about Slytherin?"

"Well, personally, I think it would be the best fit, you have great ambitions Mr. Potter, and your desire for power and freedom fits right in there."

"Would I be able to learn in Slytherin?"

"Certainly, Slytherin values knowledge too, but more in the sense of applicable knowledge."

"Would I be able to...become powerful, to become great."

"Mr. Potter, Slytherin is the House that will put you on the way to greatness."

That sounded really good.

"Well then, Slytherin it is."

The Hat laughed, "Heh, this will be interesting, I look forward to see what you accomplish there Mr. Potter, and give you my best wishes in SLYTHERIN!"
