Wait. But the thing about Harry is that he is defiant, he has all those things happen but he still wants to fight and isn't afraid to do it even if it's going to hurt him, he has been like that ever since he was a kid.

It's part of his character to be like that, and there are people like that, they hit back, despite the odds.

A "realistic" Harry with his canon personality would be Tom Riddle 2.0, only he's more violent and brutal IMHO.

Shinji's personality was much meeker, even when he was a little kid, and way before all the psychological manipulation his father put him through so when the time comes he chooses Instrumentality(only Gendo didn't count on Yui, Lilith, and ADAM intervening and convincing Shinji to reverse it)

And Manga Shinji IIRC is much ballsier than anime Shinji, similar to Rebuild!Shinji, that only gets down when he's betrayed by practically everyone and wrongly accused of destroying the world.
