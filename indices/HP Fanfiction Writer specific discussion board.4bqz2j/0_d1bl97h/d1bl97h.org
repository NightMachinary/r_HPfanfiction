As per the discussion surrounding additional support for HP Fan fic writers I have just established this board for people who want to have more detailed and writing focussed conversation regarding fanfic. Any and all welcome. It is also from this board that I hope to establish a "rare pair" exchange/challenge, assuming I can find some additional mods/interested parties to help out ( looking in your direction [[/u/beta_reader][u/beta_reader]] )
