Good luck. I've posted a request for Harry/Katie suggestions multiple times before on this sub and even on the regular fanfic sub.

I've gotten maybe 2 total suggestions ever that are not 1 shots and even 1 shots are far and few between.

Its a pairing that's underserved in fanfiction and yet despite years of requests, it does not seem to be interesting to the majority of fanfic authors despite a ready-made audience. I had plans to try my hand at writing one but I had to give up writing due to other RL obligations/desires and a cancer diagnosis that took up more of my free time. Doesn't stop me sitting here every day hoping some new great Harry/Katie story will be discovered lol.
