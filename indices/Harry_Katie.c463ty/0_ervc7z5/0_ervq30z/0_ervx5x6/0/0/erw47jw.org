  Ginny ended up being the best option for a pairing in the books because Rowling needed someone stable.

Well for starters I don't think Ginny is "stable" either by the judgments you passed on both Hermione and Luna. Ginny was possessed by Voldemort at one point and who knows what that did, started off as a slightly crazy fangirl, and has multiple "obsession" personality traits which bleed into her life creating other questionable behavior (like possibly using people to make others jealous).

Hermione definitely had issues, but I would argue shes far more stable than Ginny most of the series and has far more traits that compliment Harry. Luna is the same way but from a completely different angle. Where Hermione is a stabilizing force in Harry's life for the most part, Luna allows him to escape, relax, and have fun.

And let's not forget Harry has his own issues which, in my view, Ginny literally doesn't grasp at any point in the series. Both Luna and Hermione arguably understand those elements of Harry that could be called "issues" far better than Ginny ever could. I am not hating on Ginny necessarily. I still think she was done a massive disservice by JK most of the time and always felt forced. Perhaps if she was better developed earlier on it would have changed things.
