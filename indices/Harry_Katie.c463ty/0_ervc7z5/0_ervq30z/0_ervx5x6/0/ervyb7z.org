I think it's more the fact the authors fall on existing tropes and cliches and make a Ginny 2.0.

Her being older/knowledgeable would be a bit interesting. She does spend the most time in the series with Harry apart from Hermione because of practices.

linkffn(4003405) is pretty much the only one I've ever read.

I disagree that Rowling made massive mistakes. She could have developed Ginny more, but whenever she did show up, she listened to Harry's concerns.

I also have a bit of an issue with Hermione. She felt static over the series and the way she treated Harry in the later books was abysmal. The scene where she attacked Ron with birds also bothered me a bit, as here is a guy having fun with his girlfriend, and she decides to attack him with birds. Harry also seemed to not find her attractive on a regular basis. Her and Harry would inevitably be excessively cold.

Luna is a lovely character, but I feel her and Harry would only work out if she got counselling. Quite a few of the creatures were imaginary and she was a conspiracy theorist.

Ginny ended up being the best option for a pairing in the books because Rowling needed someone stable.
