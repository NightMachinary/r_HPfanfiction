  I think it's more the fact the authors fall on existing tropes and cliches and make a Ginny 2.0.

Except that there are hardly any fics, so it is hard to describe it as a common pitfall...

I also don't see the connection. The only thing they have in common is the sport. It is like saying a Cho romance would be like Ginny. (If anything, a Katie romance would be like a Cho romance without the Cedric or interhouse drama)

Katie is older, which is a different dynamic.

Katie isn't involved with the main plot, while Ginny and her family is. (This means her getting involved for Harry's sake would have a different meeting.)

She doesn't have the hero worship mess Ginny had. Or the possession.

She can also serve as a 'introduce Harry to the half-blood world', the way Daphne does for purebloods.

And I think she is described as only doing the sport for fun / no interest in it as a career.

It also has the interesting possibilities of starting earlier than most, as you can write mostly Canon compliant interactions for years 1-3 without breaking any plot, and have that build into a romance. With Ginny, any development in year 2-3 has to be based off of hero worship or her rescue
