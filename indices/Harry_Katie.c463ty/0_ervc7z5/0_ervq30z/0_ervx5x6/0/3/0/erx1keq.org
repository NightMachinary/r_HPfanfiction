Ouch. I'll take the hit for it being uncommon.

I've read a couple of unfinished stories.

Ginny was actually not that badly developed in canon. They were both good at Quidditch and dealt with Voldemort's possession. She listened to Harry and grew out of the fangirl stage. The issue is that when Harry started taking an interest in her, she suddenly is this awesome person out of the blue (Harry is a very unreliable narrator).

Katie did end up having the necklace incident in book 6, but she was on the Quidditch team book 1-6. The lack of a Weasley dynamic is interesting. She has no baggage so to speak. If canon Harry found her attractive then it could work, but you would really have to try to get something deep that isn't romantic garbage. I find the writers for the ones I have read just have a Ginny-Lite.

How do you think Cho would have ended up if Harry asked her out first? She ended up being really insecure about Hermione in book 5 and while Katie has integrity in book 6 (refusing being a chaser without doing a tryout), you don't really see enough of her personality.

That's why I see her as a Ginny copy. We really don't see jealousy from Ginny in book 5 & 6.

Feel free to disagree. If you have dissenting evidence, share it! I didn't reference my ebooks for this.
