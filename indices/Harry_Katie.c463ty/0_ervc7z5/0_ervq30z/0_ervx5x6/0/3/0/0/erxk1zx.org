  Ouch. I'll take the hit for it being uncommon.
#+end_quote

Well, that was really the only direct criticism, the rest was just describing the potential in the pairing.

#+begin_quote
  Ginny was actually not that badly developed in canon.
#+end_quote

I don't think I said she was? If anything, I said it is a reason a writer might avoid Ginny, particularly if they didn't like her earlier character development, as it would be hard to change that without significantly impacting what we know from Canon.

Clearly if you want the same personality as Ginny, you should use her. The problem is if you want a different personality, it can be jarring when fics use Ginny but hard charge her personality precisely because of her existing development

#+begin_quote
  you don't really see enough of her personality.
#+end_quote

I mean, sure. But the same can be said about a lot of potential pairings. (Daphne). The only thing fanon about Daphne is "ice queen", and even that is not set in stone. The only thing we really knew about Tonks was she was kinda "punk". If anything, that freedom is good for a fanfic who wants to build off an established character rather than an OC.

#+begin_quote
  If canon Harry found her attractive then it could work, but you would really have to try to get something deep that isn't romantic garbage.
#+end_quote

Really? I don't think you'd have to try too hard. The 'part of a different friend circle' is a pretty common way for fanfic writers to diverge and introduce new concepts without invalidating all of cannon.

#+begin_quote
  I find the writers for the ones I have read just have a Ginny-Lite.
#+end_quote

Well, as I said, despite it's potential, there isn't a lot of good out their in this pairing. There isn't a lot of anything in this pairing.

#+begin_quote
  How do you think Cho would have ended up if Harry asked her out first
#+end_quote

In Canon? A rejection. Or perhaps a date of "hey I went on a date with the boy who lived", and the fallout of that. It was clearly set up as a "crush on a girl who didn't even notice him".

#+begin_quote
  That's why I see her as a Ginny copy. We really don't see jealousy from Ginny in book 5 & 6.
#+end_quote

I.... Still don't get it. None of the potentially interesting things about Katie have to do with jealousy?....

Want a prompt that would work with Katie but not Cho or Ginny? "Girl Harry has a slight interest in mans up and asks him to the Yule Ball". Ginny was too young and it really isn't in her personality. And Harry is set up where he really wouldn't say no, especially from one who sees him as Harry and not the Boy Who Lives.

(I think I saw a fic like this with Hermione, but that relationship is a different can of worms entirely).

Edit: also, as much as I like H/Hr, it isn't a good fit for that prompt because of how in tune she is with Harry it is likely to be a 'well I know he is having trouble getting a date'. Which is a whole different set of problems to start a fic off with
