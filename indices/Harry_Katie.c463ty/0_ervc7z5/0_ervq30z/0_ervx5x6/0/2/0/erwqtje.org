She did start writing up to that ending. She really couldn't change it much.

I agree about the characters. Hermione ended up being used for exposition, and I honestly think what could have been a great character went to the crapper because of it. That and being static.

But when Rowling switched over to the young adult genre, I wish she hadn't kept the book for every year formula. I envision something different. Years 1-3 were fine, but then maybe a 5th year book with teen Harry, school drama, and a corrupt ministry, then 7th year, with school, Harry graduating, becoming an adult, then Voldemort rises, 17 years from Godric's Hallow, symbolic of the time to grow into an adult. Then various books as he's a young adult pitted against Voldemort.

I feel this would also help make other characters have time to mature, heck Dumbledore could get over his fear of power and become minister.
