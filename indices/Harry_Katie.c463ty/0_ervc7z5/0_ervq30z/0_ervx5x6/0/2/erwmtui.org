Didn't Rowling say that she knew the ending she wanted early on and she realized that it wasn't the best but went through with it anyway from what I heard a while back from someone. I think there was a discussion recently about how Rowling's characters were plot devices that acted like characters. Regarding the stable bit though, the story is about a bunch of kids/teens/young adults forced to fight for their lives every year. I don't think any of them are completely stable.
