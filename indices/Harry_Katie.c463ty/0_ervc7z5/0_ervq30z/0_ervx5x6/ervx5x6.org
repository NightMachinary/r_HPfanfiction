  I think an issue is that Katie really doesn't have development and so ends up a Ginny with different hair color.

This inevitably always gets posted on anything Harry/Katie and while I get why, I still think it's not really true. It feels like this is brought up simply because both like Quidditch, and Katie was underdeveloped as well (although even more so than Ginny).

But in my view, Katie is quite separated from Ginny for a variety of reasons and was possibly a better match early on when both she and Ginny were still underdeveloped. Her being 1 year ahead of Harry would have set her up as a bit of a guide for a Harry in need of someone taking him under their wing a bit. Their shared interest in quidditch would certainly have brought them closer as would the time on the Gryffindor team and her friendship with the other chasers would have only helped provide Harry further structure and support. Ginny only comes along later on with regards to quidditch and does not have the same comradery the flying foxes do with anyone on the team.

The fact Katie was suspected to be a half-blood like him, with knowledge of the Muggle world would have furthered that connection. Personality traits seen later on in periods such as the DA events show she would have been a strong woman willing to stand up for what is right and help Harry. Again these are also seen in Ginny but not until WAY later and feel somewhat forced at times. It doesn't hurt that she does not have a brother who is a close friend of Harry's as that is always awkward.

  Mind I think Harry's friendship with her is at the same level as his is with Luna.

I like Luna as a pairing for Harry more than Ginny so this is interesting to contemplate.

  I like fics that leave pairings ambiguous. There's quite a few people Harry could have conceivably had chemistry with.

I don't disagree, as there are quite a few people who fit, especially if you branch to lesser developed characters. Hell, I still think his best pairing would have been with Tonks if she was just a bit younger. Hermione and Luna were both solid options as well, and to this day I feel JK made some massive mistakes with her pairings.
