I think an issue is that Katie really doesn't have development and so ends up a Ginny with different hair color.

Mind I think Harry's friendship with her is at the same level as his is with Luna.

I like fics that leave pairings ambiguous. There's quite a few people Harry could have conceivably had chemistry with.
