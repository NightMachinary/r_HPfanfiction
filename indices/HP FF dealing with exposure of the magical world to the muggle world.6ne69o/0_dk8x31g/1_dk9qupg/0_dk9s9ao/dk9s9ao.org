Because I'm bored of Ron being sidelined and/or bashed in all the fics I read, mostly. And his being born and raised in the magical world means he can have more interesting talks with muggles. And, given the Chamber of Secrets is difficult to access, he, Gilderoy Lockhart, or Harry are the best bets for a) not being discovered and unpetrified and b) surviving long enough to be excavated a few centuries in the future.
