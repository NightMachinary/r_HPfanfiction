Mm, I'm actually sitting on an idea at the moment; one where, after a divergence where Diary!Riddle and the basilisk escapes the Chamber and petrify Ron along the way, he's un-petrified in the far future after his body is discovered and excavated by muggles interested in why he hasn't decomposed.

After waking up, Ron learns that...well, I haven't figured this part out yet. Something something magic disappeared/suppressed, formerly-magical-creatures exposed, Ron's the only one who was 'alive' in the time magic vanished, so he goes with an archeological expedition to the ancient ruins of the Ministry of Magic to try and reconstruct how they made time travel work and go back in time to before he was petrified to try and set things right and stuff.
