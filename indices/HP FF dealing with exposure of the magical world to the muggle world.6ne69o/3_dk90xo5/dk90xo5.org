linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20)'s third part includes a subplot with a policewoman called Fiona who, after a failed Obliviation, investigates the wizarding world in secret with some other agents. She uses recordings on magnetophones and computers (which the Obliviators don't understand the nature of, being wizards) to counteract her repeated Obliviations.
