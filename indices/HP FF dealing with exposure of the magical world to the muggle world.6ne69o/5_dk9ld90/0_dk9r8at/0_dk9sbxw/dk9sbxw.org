It's not a perfect story by any means, but I still think it's one hell of a ride. The reason it's not recommended as much is probably because it's pretty old. But in my opinion, this story has one of the best Voldemorts of any other fic I've read. He's truly scary here, and I think that's what makes it so memorable to me. I also thought the integration of the muggle world was done very well. Muggles were neither shown as superior in their technology, nor idiots that need saving. It's a good balance, and they work side by side quite well from what I remember.
