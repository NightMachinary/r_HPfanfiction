A fic written in essay format. Perhaps not exactly the fic you are looking for because even though Muggles gets exposed to magic, it's not uncontrolled. Harry Potter deliberately, in a controlled manner, brings the magical and muggle world together and then exposes magic. After everything happens, Hermione Granger writes an essay about it named 'Disillusion'. This fic is actually this essay.
