You need a DLP account, but [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/25291/][Sincerely Yours]] by The Sorting Cat is penpal Harry and Fleur.

Hermione and Fleur agree to be penpals at the end of [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18466207][The Splendid Gallery]] but there's no letter writing in the fic itself. I really liked the character study though.
