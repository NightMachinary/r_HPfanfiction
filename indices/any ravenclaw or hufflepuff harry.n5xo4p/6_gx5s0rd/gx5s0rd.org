I'm quite fond of [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/works/27342763][(dis)illusion]] linkao3(27342763) for several reasons, but first and foremost because it does a great job of keeping Harry in-character, while still showing how he could've ended up in a different house (Ravenclaw, in this instance).
