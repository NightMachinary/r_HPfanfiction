I know what you mean. My hope, however, is to flesh out the plot, the differences, characters I will use and their personalities along with the elements I wish to add and remove before I begin writing. I hope that this will give me a solid timeline and allow me to write in a much more free-flowing way, with points of reference to come back to if I ever get stuck. It certainly is ambitious - but exciting!
