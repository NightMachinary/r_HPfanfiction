The only issue with 'Grand Worldbuilding AUs' that I've seen is the tendency to cram a lot of wider-world exposition in the first chapter. This may seem like a good way to use all of your worldbuilding plans, but it's not a good way to introduce a story. Remember, you're writing a story, not a guidebook (unless you are, but that's a whole new genre!).

If you 'show' the big and immediately important bits of your world (think in Harry Potter, we learnt the important basics pretty quickly: Hidden Magical World, Diagon Alley is the main place, Hogwarts is where they all go to school), then tease some of the later ones, that's usually a lot more effective. Give people some questions to ask and promise you'll give them the answers if they keep reading, rather than starting out like you're writing a guidebook to your world. You can still plan it out completely before you even start writing if you want, you just shouldn't tell it all to your reader right out of the gate.

And as a tangential, but related piece of advice - make peace with the fact that a significant portion of your worldbuilding won't directly make it into your narrative. It's there to act as supportive and connective tissue for the stuff that will.
