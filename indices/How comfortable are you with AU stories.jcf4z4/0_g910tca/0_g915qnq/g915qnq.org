Absolutely agree with you here, I too am often off-put by the first chapter explaining every tidbit of difference in the world that it's set in. I always imagined the world-building occurring over a long process, with the reader's knowledge growing with Harry's. I really like the idea of slowly feeding information to a reader, potentially even chapter by chapter, slowly building up the world that the story is set within. I feel that this way, a certain appreciation for the differences can be attained and allows for a smoother transition to separate it from either canon - or other stories that they may be reading at that time.

I have some truly world-bending ideas to add in, something I know many will not like. However, I intend to write this for my own enjoyment as much as the enjoyment of others.
