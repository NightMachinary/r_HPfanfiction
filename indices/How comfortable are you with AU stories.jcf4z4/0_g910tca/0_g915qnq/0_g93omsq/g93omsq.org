Exactly. The building metaphor really is a sound one. I always use a pyramid for this one. You start off with the base - that's the big, broad, heavy and important stuff that'll support everything else in the story - and build up to the pinpoint details at the top. Not only do you get that certain appreciation like you said, you get a deeper understanding of them too. That base foundation works cognitively as well as narratively.

Though my point wasn't so much about slowly feeding information as it was not immediately hitting them with too much of it right out of the gate. You want to slowly lure them into the dark alleyway before you bludgeon them over the head and steal their wallet, right? :)

The slow-feeding works for the rest of the story, but that's up to you. My only nitpick is the intro (and for the record, that intro can stretch out over a few chapters, all the first chapter specifically has to be is attention grabbing and curiosity inducing).

And writing for your own enjoyment is always the best way. This is a hobby after all, and those are supposed to be fun. :)
