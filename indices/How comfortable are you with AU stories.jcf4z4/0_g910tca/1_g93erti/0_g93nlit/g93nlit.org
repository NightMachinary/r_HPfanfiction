Heh. Indeed. To be fair, it is a hard lesson to learn. I still have to restrain myself in D&D games every now and again and I've been running them for a decade. When you've created something with the intent to show it off to other people, you kinda wanna... show it off to them, y'know? It's a lot harder than it seems to strike that balance between "Let's come on this adventure and explore the world together" and "Come look at this thing I made!" :D
