I'm fine with AU, I don't think there's anything special about "canon", and I've read several of the works spawned by HPMOR, that go way far afield from the regular HP universe as you describe. It's just a matter of how well you do it. You might look at Orders of Magnitude, which is the furthest-out of those books as far as I know.
