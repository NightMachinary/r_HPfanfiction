My advice would be not to cram all the world building in one go. But rather spread it out and include each bit a while before its used for the plot. Meaning readers familiarise themselves with your additions and understand how it could effect the AU world. This should avoid the common mistake that makes your additions were only added to further the plot.

Other than that your story idea seems very interesting and you should be fine as long as your additions make sense in the world that you have made.
