I have a fic over 100k words that's an AU of a sort. Essentially, a bunch of dragons from World of Warcraft were fleeing for their lives and appealed to the local friendly diety for a way off the planet. Elune, goddes of the moon looked at them, thought for a moment, then decided to dump them on Harry Potter.

*Elune's Pebble* been pretty well recieved so far, though my exposition dump didn't go over well. Eh, lessons learned an all that.

It's on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]], AO3, and hpfanficarchive. FF is cleanish, other sites have adult scenes. I'm working on editing the early chapters for readability, hopefully will update them within a week. (My typing program doesn't quite match up to the sites, turns out I had some minor wall of text problems.)
