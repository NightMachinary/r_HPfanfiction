I always took that part as being wandless - I thought the movie's depiction of it also solidified it, but maybe I am wrong?

To reply to the edit that you've made:

I am in complete agreeance! I have a real dislike for blatantly obvious things only being made blatantly obvious to the MC and not to the "specialists" in the story. I haven't come across many of these, but I tend to stay away from stories that depict this. I must apologize, as you perhaps have the wrong idea as to what I meant in my initial post - I did this on purpose as to not potentially give away the plot to anyone who might wish to read it in the future. Your feedback is appreciated, and I thank you for taking the time to communicate your thoughts on this matter.
