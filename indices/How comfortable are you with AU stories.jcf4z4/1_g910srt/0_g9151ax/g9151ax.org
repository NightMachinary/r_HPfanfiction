I do not disagree with much of what you have said, for me, I also dislike certain stories that go above and beyond to trash the wand or as you said "wank" wandless magic. I do like wands, and don't wish to "one-up" the Harry Potter lore as you say. However, there is something to be admired in exploring different routes for magic. With such a rich history in our own world, where myths and legends depict "magic" in many different ways. I thought it would be interesting to explore how this might have shaped magic in different communities worldwide and add this into a story. For example, European mythology often depicts magic through the usage of staffs - which over time might have evolved into wands. Perhaps the wand allows for a much more refined usage of magic, allowing mundane tasks to be completed - but other parts of the world forgo this ability to use magic in different ways? It's but an idea for now, which may or may not be a huge aspect of the story, but something I would definitely enjoy exploring.

That being said, one of the most advanced pieces of magic depicted throughout the 7 books/movies was Voldemorts wandless fire serpent in book 5 - perhaps he explored more than we have seen, throughout the stories we never got a feel for really advanced magic out there. Something that I expect we will see in Fantastic Beasts!
