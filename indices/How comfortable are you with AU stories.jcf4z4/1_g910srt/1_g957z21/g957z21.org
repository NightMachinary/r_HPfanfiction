I always thought wands were just a focus. Sure, it makes spellcasting easier, but they were also adopted because people want to be lazy. MY fic has a character not from earth looking at a wand and saying "Wow, that's a very precise tool/magical focus. I want one, but mostly for when I'm doing 'finicky bits' of magic."

I'm taking the approach of magic being like muscle, the more you use it, the more you get, so if you use the harder to use method of wandless or less exact foci, you'll grow. Also, that precision can balance out power, as in the more precise your use of magic, the less you use for the same effect. My Voldemort is a lot stronger than Albus, but Dumbledore has extremely tightly controlled magic so they end up being about the same level.
