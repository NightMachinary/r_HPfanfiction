That's what Fanfiction is, a divergence from canon. You could set it up as Bill just coming back from a tomb that left him especially paranoid, and decided to scan things at random for dark magic. He just happens by this book(the diary before it sinks it's claws into Ginny) on the coffee table next to some school books, and scans it. Boom, in universe way to greatly changing the plot. It works even better, because we don't actually really have much information on Bill's job, and how it works. There could certaintly be a mild paranoia curse that nobody picked up at the job site, because it might take a while to build up, and it was right at the end of the job. Who knows.
