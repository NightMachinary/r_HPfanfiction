But your prompt only refers to the changes resulting from Bill's visit not about other canonical stuff. Assuming that everything else stays the same, I don't think that there would be any significant plot changes. And even if Bill joined the brothers for the joyride, I doubt he would do anything because he seems like the most sensible of the brothers (and other than Percy, the most well-versed into how the Magical Britain government works) so he'd know better than to cast any spells and get Harry in trouble. Sure he might bring that issue up (but so did Ron) and still nothing would happen because Dumbledore says that Harry has to stay with the Dursleys in order for his protection charms to work.
