I get your point but if you simply say that Bill decides to visit unexpectedly, I can say that no significant changes would occur if all other things stay the same. The thing with fanfiction is that you are working on an already created world so if you don't explain all that, than the default assumption remains that all else is canon compliant (e.g. Goblin magic lies in their metalwork and don't know shit about human curses - otherwise why would they need to employ humans when they are so protective of Gringotts?).

Now, of course, you could go another route and say that Bill returns home because he has been struck by a curse while working in Egypt so he has to go to St Mungo. Turns out that that curse causes him an insatiable hunger for power and learning from his brothers what had transpired the year before at Hogwarts, he goes the Quirell route and searches for Voldemort, at first in the hopes that he will be the one to bring about the fall of the darkest wizard of their times, but Voldemort being as charming and seductive as always for people who crave power, Voldemort manages to convince Bill that he'll teach him his secrets if he spares him. Bill is smarter than Quirell and accepts his mentorship but does not allow Voldemort to posses him so he takes a snake possessed by Voldemort who can speak to him.

Voldemort, unable to get through the blood wards at Privet Drive, convinces Bill to join his brothers on the rescue mission and orders him to kill the Dursleys, under the pretense that he is being righteous, in order to terminate the blood wards (he will deal later with Harry's blood protection). When the Ministry detects that - despite their previous warning - magic has been used at Privet Drive once again, and on top of that Unforgivable Curse, it comes to take Harry away. Bill modifies Harry's and his brothers' memories Tom Riddle style and makes everyone think that Harry went bonkers and killed his relatives.

The Ministry takes Harry to Azkaban but having no more blood wards and Dumbledore unaware of the situation, Bill ambushes the group of Aurors taking him there. He abducts Harry and he helps Voldemort resurrect himself. Of course the whole Priori Incantatem happens again because Voldemort wants to be the one to kill Harry and when Bill snaps out of his curse (or maybe his conscience takes over) he helps Harry escape, sacrificing himself in the process.

The rest of the plot remains somewhat the same, except it takes Harry and Dumbledore longer to figure out the Horcruxes, Harry is a wanted murderer until the Ministry finally accepts that it was all Voldemort's plot. Ginny never falls in love with Harry and the Weasleys, as well as Hermione who has grown quite close to Ron, hate him for having lead to the death of Bill.
