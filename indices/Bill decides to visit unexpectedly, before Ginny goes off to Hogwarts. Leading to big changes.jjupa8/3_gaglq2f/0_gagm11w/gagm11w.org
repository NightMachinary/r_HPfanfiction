First it's just a prompt, that's the thing with fanfiction, it doesn't have to be canon.

Second, who knows maybe each Horcrux is a bit different. We also don't know how long Ginny was writing in the diary. She could have started writing in it before going to Hogwarts, Bill might have felt something was off with the diary, maybe not Horcrux, but maybe it was some kind of dark magic he felt. (Didn't he learn from Goblins? He could have picked up stuff from them there, with different types of magic).

While the Wizarding World is pretty crazy when it comes to relatives endangering kids in an effort to see if said kid has magic, if Bill decided to go with them and saw that Harry had the bars on the window, the cat flap as well as the locks on the outside of the door, I'm sure he'd be pretty upset by it and could do something.
