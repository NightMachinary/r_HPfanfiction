Even if Bill decided to visit, I doubt he'd have discovered that the diary is a Horcrux. The Horcruxes didn't give off that dark artefact vibe right from the start as, say, the Hand of Glory or the cursed necklace. Remember that Lucius slipped the diary to Ginny right under Arthur's nose, who at the time was involved in a mass investigation of dark artefacts and in a +library+ bookstore full of wizards. No one noticed anything odd (other that it could not be opened) about the locket. Harry (and generations of other wizards) just passed by the diadem in the Room of Requirements without even giving it a second thought. And Bill seems the kind of guy who would not snoop into his sister's diary so he wouldn't know that it was contained a piece of someone's soul.

Also I doubt Bill would have done anything other than try to cover for his brothers when they went to rescue Harry. It's not like the punishment of degnoming the garden was significant to the plot anyway.
