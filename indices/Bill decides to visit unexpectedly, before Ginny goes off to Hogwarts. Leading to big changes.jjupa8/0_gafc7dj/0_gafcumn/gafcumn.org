There's so much that can be done with him, but even in fanfiction, he's so under used. It's criminal, really.

You have someone who is related to the Weasley's, has a rather cool looking job, we didn't get much of him in the books, but seemed rather chill about things. He could be a great help.

Heck, even Charlie, is a pretty cool brother (works with dragons! How cool is that?), and could be used more.

Edit: Bill lived in Egypt but then moved back to the UK.
