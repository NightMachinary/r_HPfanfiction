I've supported original artists on Patreon, but I don't think I'd ever support someone who just did fanworks - I don't have a moral issue with it, but I feel the benefit of patreon is you're supporting someone to grow?

In supporting some musicians, for example, I feel like I'm investing in their creative growth by giving them more time to work. Fanfiction is totally a way to grow creatively, but it won't build any further career in the same way.
