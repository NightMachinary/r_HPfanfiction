I don't know of anyone, but it does lead to an interesting ethical conundrum.

Suppose that we take it as a premise that it's unethical to profit from writing fanfic. (I disagree, myself: as far as I am concerned, the main ethical difference between an "original" writer and a fanfic writer is that the latter tend to be more honest about where they get their ideas. But, let's suppose that it is.)

Now, suppose that a fanfic writer with an established reputation sets up a Pateron account and makes the following pitch: that he or she will keep writing anyway, but any donations are going to give him or her more free time (due to having to work for fewer hours in their day job, or be able to hire help), so more fic writing will certainly get done. How much and what fic will be written, the writer will not specify, asking the donors to trust him or her based on past record and the fact that he or she has already given away a lot of material for free and will continue to do so. Is that unethical?

To take it further, suppose that the Pateron campaign is sufficiently successful that the writer can quit their day job and is effectively writing fanfic full-time, but, again, there is no explicit agreement about what fanfic would be written or even how much. What about then?
