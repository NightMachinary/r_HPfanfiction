I think it's important to make the following distinction:

1. Being paid to write fanfiction. An exchange is taking place. The relationship is essentially that of a sale. If the seller doesn't deliver then technically they could be sued for breach of contract.

2. Being financially supported by patrons. This is not an exchange because it's a one-way relationship. The patron gives money, but the patronised person doesn't give anything back in exchange. They simply carry on with whatever creative endeavours they were doing before and are free to follow their muse, whether that be fanfic, original fiction, or whatever. Vitally, the patronised person has no obligations towards their patrons.

I would posit that the first is immoral whereas the latter is not.
