You really don't see the difference between someone PM'ing me and saying "dude, I have to read the next chapter of your fic. I'll give you $100 if you update in a week" vs. someone saying, "we had a great conversation in a coffee shop, and I'm a whimsical millionaire. I think it would be cool if you had more free time to be creative. Here's $2500 a month so you don't have to work two jobs. Go nuts!"

Because one is someone directly paying me to write fanfiction, and another is just a guy supporting me in general. I think Taure's point is that if I choose to write fanfiction in my newfound free time, that's not the same as being paid for it.
