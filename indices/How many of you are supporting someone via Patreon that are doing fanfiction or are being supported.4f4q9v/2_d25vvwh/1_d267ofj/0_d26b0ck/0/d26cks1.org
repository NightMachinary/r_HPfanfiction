Except they aren't. Being financial supported in general is not the same thing as being given money to write fanfiction.

Let's imagine I was a musician who wrote fanfiction in my spare time. I have a patron who likes my music and supports me financially. But for that support, I would have to get a second job in addition to my music, and I wouldn't be able to write fanfiction. Therefore but for the patron, I would not be writing fanfiction. The patron's financial support has caused me to write fanfiction. And yet what is happening is not an exchange. The patron might not even know about the fanfiction, and certainly they have no control over it.

What this thought experiment demonstrates is that causation is not a sufficient test for exchange. Your actions and financial support can cause someone to write without having exchanged with them.

With the principle demonstrated, we can then apply it to the case of "pure fanfiction". A patron supports a fanfiction writer financially. Their financial support enables the writer to spend their time writing, so they have caused the writing of fanfiction. But as we just said, causation doesn't amount to exchange. If you want to say that an exchange has taken place you need more than merely causing a person to write.

If you think this through several examples, it seems like common sense. Imagine, for example, a parent paying their teenage child who writes fanfiction pocket money. The pocket money is a kind of stipend, exactly like patronage. Has the parent paid for their kid to write fanfiction? To say "yes" seems absurd. Again, the parent may not even know the fanfiction exists.

I think we need to avoid adopting a principle which says people who write fanfiction can never be the recipient of gifts.
