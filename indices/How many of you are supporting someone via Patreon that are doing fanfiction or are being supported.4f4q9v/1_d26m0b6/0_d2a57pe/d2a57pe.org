Thanks for sharing this, as that is some rather stunning artwork. You brought up an interesting point to me in that while I dislike the concept of accepting money for fan fiction, I see no issues with doing it for art. Really, is there that much of a difference between an artist drawing a famous person/cartoon/character/anime and someone writing a story involving them? I suppose not, yet I feel differently about whether one is acceptable to pay for or not.
