I don't know how I feel about this. I came across someone in a different fandom that was taking commissions for their work. Basically, people would pay them to write a one-shot fanfiction. Usually it's just 10,000 words or less of a romantic scene someone had in their head. I wouldn't do that, and I think it's a little pretentious of this person to do it. Why would someone pay /you/ to write something when there are entire forums dedicated to people willing to do it for free? Apparently people feel the same because she's only had two or three people actually pay her. I wouldn't pay them on Patreon because I morally don't think being paid for faniction is ok, even thought Patreon would be legal.

I'm also in the same boat with fan art. There are people who make a ton of money on Patreon making fan art, and while it's legal, it just seems a little off to me. People who do fan art or fanfiction are working really hard. The really famous people put the same amount of effort and work (and even more in some cases) in what they do than the original creators. So when I see people starting to get paid for that work when the majority aren't, it just seems wrong. Like I said, supporting people on Patreon is legal, but I don't think it's morally ok. There's also the supply and demand thing.

For example, I've followed the artist Sakimichan for a long time. When she started doing Patreon work, most of her at just became sexualized poses of famous characters. If that's what she wants to do, that's great. But her work used to be so interesting! Here is before the Patreon:

While she did fanart, a lot of her work was original or had an interesting spin to it. She mixed up styles, experimented with landscapes and generally seemed to try new things. But once she got a Patreon, a lot of people like the new stuff. So that's mainly what she does now. She draws a video game character and then creates an NSFW version with it. f you want to actually see the blurred out parts, you have to pay for it through Patreon. She also offers these weird drawing tutorial things, and I personally think they're useless, but I'm sure there are people who appreciate them. Examples of her new art:

It's awesome that she can make the insane amount of money she makes by doing what she does, but like I said, it just seems wrong. Not to mention that I've grown tired of seeing constant NSFW versions of everything she does. While her art is still beautiful, it's just not the same. The style has changed and it's somehow messier looking, in my opinion.

And I think this is what would happen to most authors if they were paid for fanfiction. They would be paid to do a short sexy or fluffy scene between two characters, and while they're still a talented author, it wouldn't be the same.
