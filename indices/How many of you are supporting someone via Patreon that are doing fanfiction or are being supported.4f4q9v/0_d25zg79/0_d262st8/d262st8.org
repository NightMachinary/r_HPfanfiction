Making money off of someone else's intellectual property would bring about a swift cease and desist. Someone else has publishing rights. Someone else has film rights. Someone else has audio rights. You can't steal their ideas and publish your own stories (for profit) based on it without compensating them.

Even if the author was okay with noncommercial use, they would be obligated to sick the lawyers on a for-profit person. You have to defend your IP fanatically or you could lose a future case.
