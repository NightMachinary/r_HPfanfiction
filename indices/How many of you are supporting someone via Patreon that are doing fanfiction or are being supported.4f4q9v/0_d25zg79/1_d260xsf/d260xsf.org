AFAIK (and IANAL), in the US, at least, whether infringement is commercial or not makes no difference as far as law is concerned.

Non-commercial use is more likely to be considered Fair Use, but from what I've read, the dichotomy is usually commercial versus educational, so recreational use might be lumped with commercial.

So, it's a copyright violation either way (or not --- I think the matter is legally ambiguous at the moment, since there haven't been much legal precedent set), and while making money from fanfic might make more likely that one gets sued (at the discretion of the copyright owner) and might affect damages awarded by a judge or a jury, it doesn't actually affect the legal status.
