okay, so here's why I started a patreon.

I do fanfiction, yes.

I also do original stuff. I have some erotica almost ready to go, a cyberpunk novella in the middle of a rewrite, a completed script for a YA storybook, a pretty good idea for a fandom review website that I'm refining and hoping to pitch someday soon, a â€˜zine that looks like it could have some interest, an outline to a nine novella series that needs some research material, and more.

I also work. 24-7. Literally. Because I'm a caregiver to a grandparent with Dementia. For no pay. Who hallucinates her three decade dead father built us a house and thinks we're going to move very soon. It's incredibly stressful, depressing, and painful to watch her mind slide.

That means I can't afford to buy new clothes(I have three shirts and two pairs of pants, only one of which I can wear outside). I am using a six year old laptop that spends more time with a rainbow beach ball than I spend writing it feels like. I can write on my iPad. But I can't make a book cover on it. I have two pairs of shoes. One pair has a hole in the sole and two inch plus long tears along the instep. The other pair is a pair of very heavy duty boots, not very comfortable in the summer. That means I can't afford to pay another person to create the book covers for me because some new bill always crops up every time I think I'm clear. I eat a cup noodle every other day, veggies and a handful of rice most days. My grandmother eats much better.

And worst of all, in January, my brother decided to steal my grandmother's debit card. And spent over a thousand dollars. We couldn't make rent or pay any bills that month for the most part until i borrowed heavily. We're behind in most utilities and paying an extra hundred a month for rent because of paying January in installments.

So, yeah, that's why I started a patreon.
