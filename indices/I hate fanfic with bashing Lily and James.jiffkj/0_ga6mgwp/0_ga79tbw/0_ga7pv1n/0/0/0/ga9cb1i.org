Yeah true! I've seen lily and james defending themselves by saying that they thought he was a squib and decided to send him to the Dursley's or an Orphanage where he could live like a Muggle. Never mind the fact that accidental magic can occur at any age before a witch or wizard gets their wand. Like Neville who was a late bloomer. This is so OOC it's unbelievable. I go right back and exit when I see this lol
