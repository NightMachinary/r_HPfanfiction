Writing dialogue is one of my main weaknesses. Even when I read it, it sounds fake and too formal half the time. Hopefully, as I write more, this will be something that I will improve. I'll also try to use beats more in dialogue. Once I catch up with my school work, I'll edit my story a bit and try to develop the characters more in dialogue, especially at the end scene (which was a bit rushed with school coming up).

You're correct when it comes to Muggles. Didn't catch that while going through my document. I'll go ahead and correct them.

As for commas, I recently developed a huge love for commas and often use it superfluously. I'll look through my document again and see if there are unnecessary commas that I should remove.

Actually, the funny thing is, in my very first draft, I almost never called Harry or Dumbledore by name, always referring them with descriptions. So, in my proofreading stage, I replaced many of them to their names. I probably did that a bit too much though. I'll fix that as well.

Thank you so much for your feedback. It was very helpful, and I truly appreciate the effort you put into this.
