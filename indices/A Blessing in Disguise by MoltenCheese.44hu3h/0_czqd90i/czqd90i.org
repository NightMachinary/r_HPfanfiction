  "And so, Harry did."

I'm not the biggest fan of beginning a sentence with a conjunction... but I only notice it because my betas regularly hound me about my own bad habit with doing this. The rules for dialogue are quite a bit more relaxed because people tend to use a lot of um's, er's and don't generally plan out what they're going to say. In this case, starting a sentence with 'and or 'but' is probably okay.

AFAIK, this word is usually capitalised. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.

Also, there are no beats in the dialogue. A 'beat' is a bit of narration peppered throughout dialogue heavy passages that give the speakers something to do. E.g. Dumbledore could stroke his beard, Harry could run a hand through his hair, etc. It's an excellent way to "show, not tell" the emotional state of the conversation's participants. Particularly during [[/spoiler][Voldemort's final monologue]], he's just talking and the reader has no idea as to his emotional state.

Dumbledore's speech patterns feel pretty close to canon (for example, he doesn't use contractions) but there is a liberal use of commas that borders on gratuitous. This is more of a personal preference so make of it what you will.

I also noticed a few instances where it might be more appropriate to refer to Harry or Dumbledore by something other than their name. The 'Headaster,' the 'young wizard,' etc. It can feel a bit jarring to the reader to read two sentences where 'Harry' and 'Dumbledore' are repeated three times each.

These flaws are /very/ minor and I offer my congratulations on your story. [[/spoiler][Even though I genuinely dislike Dark!wank]] I enjoyed it and hope you'll continue to share your writing with us.
