Definitely not a waste of time. And you made good on your promise of using an /even more complicated, nonsense plan"/ :) It didn't come across as overly tropish either. The instance of 'Constant Vigilance!' was the only annoying hpfanfiction trope that stood out to me. From how you wrote it though I interpreted it as poking fun at the trope, whether that was intentional or not.
