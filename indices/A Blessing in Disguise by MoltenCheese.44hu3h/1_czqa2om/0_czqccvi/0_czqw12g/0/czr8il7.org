Constant Vigilance didn't really bother me, because you we're poking fun at it. Do what you will.

As for Harry, that sounds like a suitably terrible fate.

My own thought, was maybe even more convoluted and cruel. Imagine the nightmare that Voldemort sent Harry going on for 13 years, forcing Harry to see and feel what Voldemort is experiencing. Voldemort petrifies Harry for years, leaving him conscious to see his friends die though Voldemort's eyes, while feeling V's sadistic satisfaction.
