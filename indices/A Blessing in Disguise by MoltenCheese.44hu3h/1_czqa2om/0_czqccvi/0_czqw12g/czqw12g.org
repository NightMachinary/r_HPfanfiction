Thank you for your words of encouragement.

As for 'Constant Vigilance', as you said, I was making fun at the trope. But if it bothered you, it'll probably bother others as well, so I'll go ahead and remove it.

Funny you mention about Harry. My initial plan was to have Voldemort kill Harry, and have Harry wake up at the very end, leaving the oneshot open-ended. However, one of my pre-readers said that readers might not appreciate that very much, so I ended up having Voldemort save Harry. As for what condition he'll be in, he'll actually be well fed, and somewhat well treated, which will likely pain him more, thinking that he doesn't deserve good treatment when others are dying because of him. Voldemort would try to break Harry as much as he could, both physically and psychologically, before finishing him.

Thank you for reading, and thanks for sharing your opinion!
