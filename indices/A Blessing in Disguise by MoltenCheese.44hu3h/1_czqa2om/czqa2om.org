This is an AU GoF oneshot of a plot bunny that I've had for ages. It's my take on what could have happened in the events of the Goblet of Fire. Instead of Voldemort's complicated, nonsense plan, I'm introducing an even more complicated, nonsense plan. Saying any more about the plot would be telling.

This is my first oneshot I've written, and I'm not a very good writer, one that is mediocre at best. Hopefully it won't be a complete waste of your time and not be so bad that you nope out before the end, where there is an interesting turnabout of events, if I may say so myself.

Also, if you could provide feedback on what I could improve, that would be awesome! Hope you enjoy!
