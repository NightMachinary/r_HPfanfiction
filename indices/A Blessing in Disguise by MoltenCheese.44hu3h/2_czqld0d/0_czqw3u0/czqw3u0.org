I completely understand what you mean. Showing, not telling is one of my weaknesses, as well as pompousness. I tend to info dump or go on and on with monologues often, and although I tried to keep it down, there probably were many parts where I could improve. I'll be sure to keep that in mind when/if I write something else. Thank you for the feedback.
