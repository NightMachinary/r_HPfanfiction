Trio centric fics:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6989327/1/Children-s-Crusade][Children's Crusade]]: 4 years after the Battle of Hogwarts, a Hermione from a different dimension is asking for help. The Trio and Ginny enter breach one more time.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]]: Canon divergent after Year 4. Guerrilla Hermione kills rank and file Death Eaters, while Dumbledore manipulates the Ministry and prepares Harry for his direct confrontation with Voldemort. Dark war epic, some romance, but it's not the focus.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12076771/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Girl-Who-Walked-on-Water][Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water]]: This is pretty much the only fic that has Trio in a romantic relationship and a good Plot. But the focus of this story is the fight against zombie battleship Bismarck, with the help of HMS Hood. [[https://youtu.be/4_jDaUSSPhc][This video]] offers some good details on their first battle in 1941.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: No magic sci-fi AU? No problem because it's a darn awesome story with an awesome Trio. Everyone is a lot more dangerous than in canon, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/lflrst/lf_ruthlessly_efficient_hermione/gmn8ph0/][especially Hermione]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]] has a 'Harry' who thinks he's Voldemort, acts like Voldemort, has the power of Voldemort, but only wants to teach DADA forever. He sees Hermione as his successor and Ron as his worthy minion. It's the most popular fic on this sub.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]]: It's canon compliant until the end of DH, but Harry and his friends eventually declare war on Wizarding Britain's incorrigible establishment. Good guys could only be pushed so far. Trio interactions are beautifully written in this fic, and George, Neville, Susan, and Fleur all get to shine.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7405516/1/We-are-the-Golden-Trio][We are the Golden Trio!]]: The Trio and a 5 day old Rose are thrown back to August 31 1991 by a powerful artifact. They decide to defeat Voldemort in a speed run like fashion.
