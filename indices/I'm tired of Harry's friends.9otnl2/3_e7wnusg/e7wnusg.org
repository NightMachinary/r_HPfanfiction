Probably not what you're looking for, but I built an entirely new story based on the community of Diagon Alley. My protagonists (both OCs) are Todd Ollivander and a girl who begins work at Ollivander's. It's a WIP and, be aware, full of OCs. There's no Harry in this story, because it's set during the Mauraders Era.

It's definitely not everyone's cup of tea, but I like writing it because I keep the tone and the world of Harry Potter, but I get to work with some fresh faces (who, imho, have similarities to canon characters).
