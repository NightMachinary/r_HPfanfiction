A personal favourite is 'The Wise One' trilogy by FarenMaddox. Essentially, Sirius escapes Azkaban when Harry is Eight years old and kidnaps him, then go on the run and Harry grows up with Sirius while travelling the world. They do come back eventually, though I can't for the life of me remember when or how (it's been awhile since I've read the entire thing - it's a little under 500,000 words across all three stories), so there is some Magical Britain in the plot. :)
