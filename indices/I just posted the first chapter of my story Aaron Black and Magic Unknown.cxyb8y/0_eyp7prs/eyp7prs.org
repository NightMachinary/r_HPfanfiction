It seems good. Only the whole community hates the Cursed Child, and by default all the children. I dont.

I helped my cousin write a time travelling James Siruis Potter fic. Its uncomplete due to personal reasons but from what he told me it barely got any response which was surprising.

I think this fandom should be more geared towards the children, as by now Harry centric stories are getting stale.

So cheers for Aaron Black! Hope you complete it
