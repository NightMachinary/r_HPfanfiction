I think more people would just be blah about it if the fans didn't present it as some sort of mythically amazing holy text of perfect writing and rationality, the likes of which has never graced something as low as fanfic before.

I mean, for goodness sakes, the subreddit where people discussed it as it was written was full of people proposing â€˜what if there was a secret fifth house that Harry was sorted into' as if it was some brilliant original idea, while still disdaining the very fandom that had already explored and mocked Sparkleypoo for many years by this point. It was an attempt at a full-blown tract disguised as fanfic, and its relationship with both fanfic (despite being an example of it) and the Harry Potter fandom is... strained.
