Wow. Thank you for this one. I've just finished reading it, and it is a really good read. Despite myself, I cried.

A couple of picky britpic moments (particularly given the era), but that really feels churlish to point out when the rest is so good. An excellent exploration of how Sirius and Regulus could have ended up where they did.
