Well, we don't have mimosas in the UK: we have Buck's Fizz and it took me until basically this year to realise that it was what Americans meant when they said mimosas. ‘Mimosa' hasn't really impinged on our culture or vocabulary at all. And we certainly didn't have mimosas at Sunday brunch in England in the 1970s, even as code for someone being gay!

And the story has people thinking Peter looks chavvy, and talking about making him look more like a chav, and the only way a British person could think someone in the 1970s would use the word like that (let alone someone raised in an aristocratic bubble!) is if they were under 16, which I am fairly sure the author is not! ‘Chav' like that wasn't really a thing until the 2000s, and it's not like that knowledge is obscure in the UK: like I say, you'd have to basically be a child to not be aware of it. It's a really jarring word choice, in a fic that otherwise uses words very carefully and effectively. The author has too good a sense of words for her to make this mistake, if she is an adult who grew up in the UK.

It's entirely possible the author mostly lives in the UK (hence visiting America, and returning to the UK), which may have helped them with the sense of place that pervades the fic so beautifully, but that doesn't mean these aren't Britpicking moments!
