Hauntingly by Obsidian Pen is the best fanfic I've ever read by far. It has become the new standard for me to judge all other harry potter fanfictions by. The style of writing just flows so great and the plot is very well put together. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7582462?view_full_work=true]]
