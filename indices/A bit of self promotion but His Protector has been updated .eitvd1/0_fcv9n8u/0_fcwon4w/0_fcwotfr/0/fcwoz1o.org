She didn't start out mad, she was once a best friend, a protective older sister, the best cousin you could ask for, she took the brunt of there grandfather's anger, dueled Walburga to a standstill when she went after Sirius .She was a protector , A confidant, and the reason he survived his childhood. She was Bellatrix, She was more than those monsters made her.

Sirius Loved Andromeda like a favorite cousin, He tolerated Narcissa And her girly Ways, Regulus was his little brother But he grew distant by the day. Bella, Bellatrix was his anchor. She had taken more beating then he could count for them. She was their protector, And every day he could see her break Little by little as the world chipped away her sanity. Every Crusio Taking it's toll, Every punch pushing her closer to the line. Yet still she Rose day after day. To make sure they did not break his will. Bella... strong, determined, beautiful, Bella , she made sure they didn't break his will. She was the Great fortress The iron wall that protected them all. And for her selflessness she paid the price, Those bastards tortured her to madness, shattering her iron will .

Sirius just stared at her with sadness, unwilling to make the kill. His family had sold her battered and broken Sending her into hell, The woman that came out Was twisted beyond recognition. A Sirius looked on He saw a proud woman brave determine but mad. Gone was the protector, The woman that would burn down the world for him, In her place stood A she demon Determined to carry out her masters will.

From that day every time he saw Bellatrix Across the battlefield he would grieve for his Beloved cousin. , who was no longer his shield.
