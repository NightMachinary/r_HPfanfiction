"What if Durmstrang and Beauxbatons also fielded a class each?"

"It only seems fair..." Karkaroff's eyes gleamed as he gazed around the packed room - forty fourth years, the champions from the other schools, as well as a variety of teachers and Ministry officials.

Barty Couch furiously paged through the rules, dust flying from ancient pages. "It seems possible, equitable even. I can find nothing against it, given the circumstances."

Ludo Bagman's wide smile became wider as he interjected. "But of course the fourth years need a fighting chance, being younger. How about the older teams be 25 students a piece."

"Zat is a deal."

Harry groaned.

THREE MONTHS LATER

Draco held the replica Hungarian Horntail is his hand, face pale. The other students crowded around in the magically expanded tent. They were the only ones left, the older teams having already left to face their respective dragons. There had been a fair bit of yelling and screaming.

"We're fucked," said Terry Boot.

"Not if we follow the plan," interjected Susan Bones. "Hit wizard tactics, like we planned. Stunners and shields. And the seekers on brooms to grab the egg while it's distracted."

Harry and Draco's eyes met across the tent. Three months earlier he would have never worked with Malfoy, but now, needs must.

"Good luck everyone. Try not to die."

​

TWO MONTHS LATER

"But how can we breathe underwater?" Harry said, beginning to panic.

Padma Patil rolled her eyes. "Have you never heard of the Bubblehead Charm?"

​

FOUR MONTHS LATER

Harry panted as he ran through the maze. The fourth years had become separated when the swarm of blast ended skrewts had attacked them, and then separated again when a troll had come lumbering out of another pathway. More had been stunned in a brief but violent scuffle with the Beauxbatons team.

All he had left with him was Ron, Draco and Lavender. They looked shell shocked. Around them, beyond the hedges he could hear yelling as other teams came under attack.

Harry's wand spun in his hand as they turned a corner. "We're getting closer! Just follow the plan and we can reconnect with the others."

There was a flash of red and Ron hit the ground, stunned.

Mad Eyed Moody stepped around the hedge, wand raised.

"You've made quite a mess of things, Potter, but this ends here."
