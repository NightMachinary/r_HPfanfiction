Oho! Maybe Moody was the one who brought the cup into the great hall and confounded it with something along the lines of 'the name entered into this cup belongs to its own school' and it just worked for all of them? Since the other schools would have their champions more or less decided and all of the valid ballots already placed. And then the cup's internal code ran an error and since all of the names were on the same page they all counted as a single entry.
