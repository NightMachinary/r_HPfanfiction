"Harry Potter!" Dumbledore called out. Harry froze in his seat. He couldn't believe it. There was an Age Line around the Goblet, so how on earth...?

Around him, the Hall fell silent and all eyes focused on him. He groaned when he saw Ron's mutinous stare. Apparently, his best friend thought he had put his name in.

"I didn't put my name in," he said desperately. "You know I didn't---"

"Ron Weasley!"

Ron's expression changed from anger to shock. Up at the staff table, Dumbledore was, for once, looking bewildered.

"Figures," Malfoy said loudly with a sneer. "Potter wouldn't do anything without his sidekick."

"Draco Malfoy!"

That shut Malfoy up. As he muttered that his father would hear about this, Dumbledore went on to call out the names of every single fourth year.

'Well,' Harry thought grimly as he made his way to the antechamber along with the rest of his classmates, 'At least they can't say I entered my name now.'
