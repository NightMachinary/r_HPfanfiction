I wouldn't call Wind Shear a Harry/Bellatrix fic. There isn't /any/ romance, and Bellatrix's 'screen time' is super low. I don't think it's even clear whether they actually end up together or not.

Bellatrix is basically obsessed with him (after he kills all her 'friends' in front of her, leaving only her alive to deliver a message to Voldemort; classic Bella there) and spends the whole fic trying to impress him, but nothing ever comes of it. /He/ is certainly not interested, rather amused by her (ridiculous) efforts.
