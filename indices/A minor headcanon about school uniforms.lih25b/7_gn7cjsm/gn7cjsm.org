My assumption has always been that while the letter specifies three sets of plain robes the richer students would have more and in different fabrics.

Your basic, bog-standard Hogwarts robe is probably either a heavy cotton, a heavy linen or even a medium weight wool. Natural fibres, warm enough for the winter but with a degree of breathability for the summer. That's what Madam Malkin likely sells as her basic Hogwarts package, minimally tailored and likely with some length in the cuffs and seams so they could be let down by a parent or a house elf. My guess on the cloaks is broadcloth.

Someone like Draco Malfoy might have one set in the bog-standard material but would also have a heavy woolen set for winter and a lighter set (cotton, linen, silk or summer weight wool) for the summer and probably a few in between. His would also likely be better tailored, requiring far more alterations as he grew up. Not done automatically by a spell but done by a person, because that would cost more and therefore would be fancier.
