In the movies, the first-years are all wearing plain black ties. Their house ties and scarves are with their trunks when they get to their dorms the first night.

In some fanfictions, the black ties and a generic Hogwarts badge on the robes all update overnight; sometimes through a charm and sometimes by the house elves.
