The supplies list in the first letter specifies only 3 sets of plain robes and a pointy hat. I tried to look up the exact wording to see if there was anything about the robes having house patches added, or if the house ties are even in the books, but can't find my copy of Philosopher's Stone. (Of course, out of seven books, the one I want to reference is the one on walkabout.)

What is canon is that not everybody wears trousers under their robes. Fanon often has this as a traditional robes, with nothing underneath, versus modern robes over clothes. This is the only reason that makes sense (to me) for girls and boys to have to give each other privacy on the train to change.
