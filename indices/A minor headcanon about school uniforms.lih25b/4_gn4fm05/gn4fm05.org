My high school uniform was only sold at one chain (2 locations) and they were pricey. All the shirts sweaters and blazers had logos embroidered on them. But a few girls I knew when they outgrew their stuff, just cut out the logo and sewed in onto generic clothing (white polos and navy cardigans are easy to find). There was nothing the school could do, but they fumed over it.

Shoes are where the rich and poor showed, they just had to be neutral colors, closed, and no heel.

I think harry mentions wearing his trainers under his robes, so at least there wasn't a required shoe.
