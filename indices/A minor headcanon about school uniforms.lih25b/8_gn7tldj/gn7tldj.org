Possibly, but I think there is more to explore in both uniforms and the casual wear regarding the style as well as the price. Are the students, as they grow older, trying to get away with more risque uniforms/casual wear for when not in class? How are they using clothes to signal belonging to specific groups? Is there a tension between more muggle like and more wizard like fashions? Are kids enchanting their clothes with flashy charms to show off?
