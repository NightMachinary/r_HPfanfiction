In my high school, uniforms for girls are a white short sleeve shirt and a bright blue pinafore while for boys it's the same shirt with olive green pants.

Girls' uniforms can't really be modified because we have a rule that the skirt can't be above the knees (for modesty) but the two options for acquiring uniforms are either buying them from supermarkets (pinafores that are supermarket-bought are obvious because the skirt will be an A-line skirt with no pleats or ruffles) or getting them tailored made, either by seamstresses or mothers that can sew (like mine).

But boys' uniforms are a lot more customizable as I've seen lots of them having their pants tailored to be more fitted and/or tight. Because you know, the pants from supermarkets are super flared. And our ex headmistress and the head administrator hated the tight pants.

Also, there are specified shoes that you should wear to school. White school shoes. Some people wear white branded shoes to school and the same higher-up teachers were always pissed
