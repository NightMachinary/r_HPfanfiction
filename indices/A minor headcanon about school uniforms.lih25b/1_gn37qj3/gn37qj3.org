I was about the disagree with this... then i remembered that i always got my School uniform from a tailor while some of my classmates had to settle for cheaper supermarket brand shirts/blazers/trousers.

In fact the only part of our uniform that had to by identical was our tie, which all local clothes stores stocked for new term.

I'm now wondering just how much money my guardians spent on that damn uniform that i hated.
