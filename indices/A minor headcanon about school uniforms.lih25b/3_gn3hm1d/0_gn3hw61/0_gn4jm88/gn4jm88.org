It's not uncommon at all. There are some parents at our school who try the 'oh just let me look through the lost property box and I'll recognise it' and then try and take anything that is not named (or even if it is named somewhere easy to cover or cut off the tags). That's why we've had to put ours well away and only return items that are named. Anything else gets handed to the first aid office to use when a child needs a spare set of clothes (they're supposed to come back (washed), but only about 10% ever does).
