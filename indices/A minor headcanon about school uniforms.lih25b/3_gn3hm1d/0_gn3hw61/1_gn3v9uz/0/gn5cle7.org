We were in track together, so our parents saw each other every weekend on top of this. I was also one of two families with the same last name, except the other family had only boys, so literally, just me with that name written in bold fabric marker along the seams.

But I could only imagine the possibilities of chaos since robes seem very unisex. Unisex uniforms, save for the underneath clothes. I think it would be very obvious to see the fabric difference between new and old robes. Maybe even just between the Weasley sons, and then their shorter, first year sister who maybe got second hand robes from a shop and not just her older brothers. Even hems not being as crisp, the opportunities for mildly frayed edges, or loose, unstarched creases.
