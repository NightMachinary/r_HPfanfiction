I can agree, I also wore schools uniforms between the ages of 4 - 17 years of age. My high school had 1 supplier, BUT! There was a mom & pop run business that was able to buy the same fabric and sew the same patterns.\\
Really sucked when the mom & pop shop folded because the kids didn't understand the business.

On the other hand, imagining that everything in the magic world was hand-produced, maybe Hogwarts had more regulations about robes than not.

As for tailoring, yeah, maybe the richer families would have pre-installed tailoring spells, but assuming the kids grow, I could see it being a mandatory thing and maybe overlong usage, it wears out.

I can compare this to my own classmate ("N") and I, who was a single child. N stole my brand new uniform skirt in 7th grade.\\
I knew right away that the one remaining skirt in the lockers was not mine because the fabric was worn and fuzzy. N inherited her skirts from her older sisters and you could tell from the wear. (And that's the end of that story unless you'd like to hear about how I reclaimed my skirt by vomiting on her, which was an accident but after taking it home to be washed I wasn't going to return a skirt with my name written all over every single seam. Her mom and gma are bitches too because they had to let out the belt and zipper because she was larger and taller than I was.)
