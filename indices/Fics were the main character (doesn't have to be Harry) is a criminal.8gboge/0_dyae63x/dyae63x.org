Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Harry is branded as "Undesirable No. 1" for opposing the government. He then goes on the run and hides in a tent with his friends as fugitives. A bit too much teenage angst for my taste and almost everyone holds an idiot ball at some point in time to move the plot along. There's some god action and a giant battle in the end to make up for it though.
