Harry racks up a considerable bounty in linkffn(Havoc Side of the Force) Starting with indirectly killing 27 Jedi, murdering several people and stealing their ship, mutilating a merchant (The guy rips off his hand trying to break the sticking charm holding it to the counter) and that's just on Coruscant while he tries to find his way around. He racks up even more charges as he makes his way top Corellia, where he manages to get most of them dropped, while also committing vandalism against a prosecutor who reminded him of Umbridge and had double-parked.
