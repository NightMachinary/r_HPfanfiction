Recently became aware of Lady Thief. I didn't read it because Hermione is indeed the MC.

Dodging prison and Stealing witches. Harry as protagonist, spends significant amount of time drug dealing and considering who's against him, you can argue most of his activities are criminal.

I'll add more if I think of them.
