linkffn(Madley in Love)

After the war he lost his vault, or rather, he never went to Gringotts and because of it, he's completely broke. All he has is a cottage and he works helping a lot of people, basically a handyman. You can clearly see he's happy and satisfied with his life, though he gets a bit lonely. Which is where Laura comes in and changes things up. Really sweet story overal, pretty chill. No big drama at all. I don't remember if he joined the Aurors and then quit or didn't join at all, so I'm sorry that this doesn't exactly fit your request.
