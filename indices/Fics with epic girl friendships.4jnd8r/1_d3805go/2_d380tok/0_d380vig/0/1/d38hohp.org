There aren't a whole lot. There aren't even a lot of female characters. I'd say McGonagall + umbridge (as stated below), Hermione + Ginny (argue about quidditch HBP), Lily + Petunia (although it quickly becomes about Snape..), brief snippets between Mrs Weasley + Tonks, Hermione, Ginny, Fleur. But I'm reaching a bit. This is off the top of my head for all seven books :/
