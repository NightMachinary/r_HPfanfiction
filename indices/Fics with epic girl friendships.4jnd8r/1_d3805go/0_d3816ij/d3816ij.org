I feel the Bechdel test oversimplifies the issue of gender equality and writing nuanced female characters. Girls talking about guys isn't the issue --I mean if they're out to save the world, they could be talking about Voldemort, who is a dude. What matters more is /what/ they're saying imo. I'm more interested in having well-developed and complicated characters (+friendships) than a fic passing some highly subjective test.
