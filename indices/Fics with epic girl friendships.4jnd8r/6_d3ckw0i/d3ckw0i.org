There was one where a group of girls went out for lunch once a week or so. I forgot who was the main character, but she was surprised to see Pansy when she met up with Ginny, and Pansy says that it's been 15 years - people change, or something like that. Ginny and Pansy both work for the prophet.

It struck me as a coming of age piece.
