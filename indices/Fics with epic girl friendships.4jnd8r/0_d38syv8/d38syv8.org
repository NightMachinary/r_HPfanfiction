Linkffn(the arithmancer) is Hermione centric. Her relationship with Professor Vector is a really great example of mentor/student relationship, moving into friendship later.

I also want to mention linkffn(yule ball panic by philosophize) even though it's primarily fem!Harry/Hermione slash--the fic (really, the sequels) are all about reclaiming the sacred feminine and has a strong focus on the female characters in general, a great female mentor (in Mcgonagall) and strong bonds of friendship between the pair and Fleur and Gabrielle in particular.

I'm also 100% sure that one of the 'Hermione goes back in time to the marauder era to fix everything and falls in love with a marauder" fics has a strong friendship with Lily, but I can't think of which one. I've read a bunch of them; Hermione / Sirius is my OTP. It's not "debt of time" or "one hundred sixty nine".

Lastly, I want to mention linkffn(the pureblood pretense) and its sequels. It's another fem!harry fic, but fem!harry has to pretend to be Sirius Black's son for . . . reasons. Technically, this means that Rigel and her friend Pansy have a close female friendship, but I feel weird about recommending it because, of course, Pansy doesn't know that Rigel is a girl . . . but it's a really good set of fics!
