The sadly incomplete and ultra+cracky linkffn(The NOT Triwizard Tournament) has the premise that if the goblet can be fooled once, then it can be fooled again, and again, and again. And again.

It's a silly idea, obviously abandoned, and poorly written - but worth a quick read anyway just for the laughs.
