  (aka 'how to survive endless rebirth with your so-called soulmate')Harry and Tom's souls are tied together. Which is why they're in this endless loop of rebirth. At some point, they stopped caring and just started fucking with people.(cracky humor with a hint of seriousness and plot, my specialty)

  Unsatisfied with his post-war life, Harry decides to get to the root of all of his problems when that root was still working at Borgin and Burkes shop in the late 40s. He's the Master of Death, damn it, he can do what he wants for once in his life.Tom Riddle isn't particularly happy about working at a small, dingy shop for magical artifacts, no matter how interesting those artifacts are. He's even less happy when an insufferable stranger sets up the most obnoxious flower shop right across the street.What follows would be a romantic comedy, if it weren't for politics.
