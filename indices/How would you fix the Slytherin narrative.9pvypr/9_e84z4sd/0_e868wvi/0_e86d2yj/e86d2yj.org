In mine, it's basically as I said. Gryffindors tend to be naturals as Transfiguration and fire magic (both dangerous and can be used reckless), while Slytherins are geared towards Conjugation and water magic. It just seemed a better way to do it since it eliminates the whole "Most of the dark wizards come from this house of ambition", since they obviously wouldn't have the same magical aptitudes.
