I think this makes the most sense. It would be justified historically if each of the Founders was particularly known for mastery in specific fields of magic, so ``belonging'' to a House back when Hogwarts was founded would mean you had more classes with your respective Head of House, or something along those lines. It could even be retconned by saying that the actual institution of Hogwarts Houses was created several years after the time of the Founders by a Headmaster with an agenda.
