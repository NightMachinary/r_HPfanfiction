  Andromeda Tonks, who ditched her "Slytherin family" and ran away with Edward

This is kind of the first thing that suggests that they're not as evil as canon portrays them to be - If Slytherins (and Blacks) are so evil and mad about blood purity, why was Andromeda allowed to live so long? Going on by how Sirius describes them, they seem like the kind of characters who would find honour killing acceptable - but they don't do it, even when it could have been done and the blame placed at Voldemort's feet.

And during the second war, Bellatrix and Narcissa, being the evil Slytherins that they are, didn't attack Andromeda and Ted - they just let them be. Ted was killed by Snatchers, not by either Bellatrix or Narcissa.

Nymphadora also had a child with a werewolf, of all things, and neither she, nor her mother or child or husband were killed for that - in spite of Voldemort himself talking about culling the unwanted branches from the pure trees (or something similar).

  With the exception of Pettigrew, all Death Eaters we know the house of came from Slytherin

One of the things that is said about the first war was that no one knew who to trust - this is a suggestion that literally anyone could be a Death Eater, and the mistrust probably came from people who were revealed as Death Eaters themselves. People who no one would have guessed becoming Death Eaters could have been what fueled such a deep seated feeling of mistrust in the populace. That is more than enough to say that there were Death Eaters from all four houses.
