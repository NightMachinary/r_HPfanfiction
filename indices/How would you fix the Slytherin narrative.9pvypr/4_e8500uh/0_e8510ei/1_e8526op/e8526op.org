  Bellatrix claimed that she would take care of her

But she didn't. And since Ted worked at some government place or the other, they had all the records available, including their residence. We know this because they were interrogated after the Ministry's fall - Remus said that they were shaken but okay - Bellatrix could have easily killed them both then and there, but she didn't. She also didn't kill her niece at that time, nor her niece's werewolf husband.

  her first "public" appearance both she and Lupin are killed.

Despite what the canon HP series would like to write, people generally get killed in battles. And they could just as easily have been killed by any other Death Eater.

  No one killed Sirius either, and he was in Azkaban for a decade with the worst of the worst.

What? What does Sirius have to do with what I said?

#+begin_quote
  She did not speak up when her husband dodged prison. And considering that he was a fascist thug who worked towards a genocide, that would definitely have been the decent thing to do.

I'm going to go out on a limb and say that the Imperius defence is actually a more solid defence than fanon authors would like to think. In HP's class of 40, only 1 student (HP himself) can stand up to the curse when performed by a legit Death Eater. 1 in 40. When you look at it that way, Lucius' Imperius defense is quite solid, and he might not have told her the truth about it.

After the resurrection, she didn't bother because there was a Dark Lord in the house. Between her life, the lives of her son and husband, and the lives of random strangers, I'm not surprised she chose the former.
