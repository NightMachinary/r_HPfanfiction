Why would Lucius want to have Sirius killed? Sirius is already out of the equation, and Lucius is on shaky ground following his trial there would be no reason for him to do so. Later on once he has Fudge's ear, he wouldn't care about Sirius (probably forgot about his existence after 10+ years) considering how he was sentenced for life and nobody would ever hear from "Voldemort's right hand man" again. Nobody had ever escaped from Azkaban before Sirius, so Lucius had no reason to think he would ever be a problem again.

Also, with basic sanitation and physical activity, you're assuming a lot about what wizards need in order to survive. Humans, we definitely would need that, but in Harry Potter the wizards tend to be much more resistant than muggles. Just look at how Mad-Eye spent almost an entire school year stuck in a trunk. I'm pretty sure he didn't receive physical recreation or any showers, and he still managed to survive. In all fairness his stint being locked up is much shorter than Sirius', but it gives some sort of indication of a magical person's resistance.
