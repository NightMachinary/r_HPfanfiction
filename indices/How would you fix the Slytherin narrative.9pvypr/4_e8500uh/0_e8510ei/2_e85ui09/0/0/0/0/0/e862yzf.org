While Narcissa was certainly not a good person, there only instance of her breaking the law is keeping silent when Lucius dodged Azkaban. Being a bigot is not a crime, just a shitty thing to be.

Leading a terrorist raid into a school of children on the other hand is one. Supplying intelligence to the magical equivalent of Adolf Hitler is another. Attempted murder and grievous bodily harm are crimes. And a good deed does not wash away a bad one. You don't get off murder charges just because you also saved an old lady out of a fire.
