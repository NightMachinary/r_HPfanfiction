narcissa was a bigot who fully supported lucius' actions, just didn't want to do the work

snape absolutely did reject the ideology, and opposed it. which is the entire point of his arc, harry naming his child after him, etc. that you don't want to acknowledge it doesn't make it not true

it's hilarious that you constantly whine about draco and snape- people who actually reformed, yet defend actual evil people like narcissa
