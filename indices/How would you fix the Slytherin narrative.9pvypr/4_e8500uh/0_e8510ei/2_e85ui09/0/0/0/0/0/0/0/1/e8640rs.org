  Great, we agree that Snape and the Malfoys are human trash then.

*both of them changed their views*. it's like pulling teeth with you.

snape defected to protect lily, then after her death reformed

here is what jkr has said about the malfoy family on pottermore:

#+begin_quote
  After the events of the second wizarding war, Lucius found his son as affectionate as ever, but *refusing to follow the same old pure-blood line.*

  *Draco married the younger sister of a fellow Slytherin. Astoria Greengrass, who had gone through a similar (though less violent and frightening) conversion from pure-blood ideals to a more tolerant life view, was felt by Narcissa and Lucius to be something of a disappointment as a daughter-in-law. They had had high hopes of a girl whose family featured on the â€˜Sacred Twenty-Eight', but as Astoria refused to raise their grandson Scorpius in the belief that Muggles were scum, family gatherings were often fraught with tension.*

so, draco rejects his family's bigotry, raises his son to be much better, whereas his parents still think a group of human beings are scum

here is what she's said about snape:

#+begin_quote
  He stood to gain nothing personally but the triumph of the cause Lily had believed in. He was trying to do right.
#+end_quote

heres's what she's said about lucius and narcissa:

#+begin_quote
  K. Rowling: No, the Malfoys weaseled their way out of trouble (again) due to the fact that they colluded (*albeit out of self-interest*) with Harry at the end of the battle.

  Because the law is the thing which a society uses to judge the actions of people and whether they should be punished. You can't punish thoughts unless you are a dictatorship.
#+end_quote

the law is not the same as morality. this is such a childish view it's amazing. the law is different in different places. *supporting nazis makes you evil*

#+begin_quote
  Meanwhile any Death Eater is guilty of multiple war crimes and letting any get away with them is an insult to their victims.
#+end_quote

so is saying that people who support their actions and do nothing against them aren't evil
