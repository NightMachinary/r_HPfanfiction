I think the problem is that a lot of people had their perception of Slytherin House and Death Eaters skewed by Hagrid in Book 1 (in much the same way as Harry had his view skewed) when he said that 'there's not a witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin.' which is...a very Hagrid thing to say, but not entirely accurate, since we've got Sirius Black (according to what Hagrid knew when he said it) who was Voldemorts most loyal blah blah blah and a Griffindor, and in reality Peter Pettigrew.

So we already knew that Hagrid was exaggerating on at least one count - he personally knew of at least one Gryffindor who joined the Death Eaters, while we also know of one - but that doesn't mean that there weren't others.
