Of course. This entire post is made by one such guy who seems to believe that Slytherins cannot be good people because of that.

He even takes examples off the last battle - because none of the Slytherins were interested in fighting a battle against Death Eaters (who were better led, were more numerous, and didn't have a problem with killing unlike the Hogwarts defenders) that they're not decent people. He either has no concept of self preservation, or is exceedingly self-righteous.
