Lel. His argument for the Slughorn is that "he should have known it wasn't an academic discussion". He's worked out Slughorn to be omniscient there.

I hate Snape just as much as the next guy, but the idea that he sabotages his country's defence force and medical force is one of those retarded fanon ideas.

It's like I said, OP has some issues with self righteousness. He mentioned somewhere that he's German, so that's probably it
