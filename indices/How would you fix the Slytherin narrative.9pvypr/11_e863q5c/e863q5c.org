Hm, my favorite way would actual to get rid of Slytherin and put the students in other houses. Every noteworthy Slytherin has some other strong house trait.

Voldemort, Snape -> thirst for knowledge -> Ravenclaw

Slughorn, Draco, Crabbe and Goyle -> get their validation out of their social standing and group connection -> Hufflepuff

Bellatrix, Crouch Jr. -> are reckless and ready to take huge risks to fulfill Voldemort's plans -> Gryffindor

It would not create that one bad house and it would give all the other houses a more balanced way of dealing with their traits and would create a dark side to their traits.

But if we want to keep Slytherin there are two ways. Either pull the other houses down closer to Slytherin, be giving more death eater characters to those houses and please some that are terrible in their house way (not Pettigrew that became a death eater because he was the opposite of Gryffindor by being a coward).

You know a Gryffindor battlefield commander that lives for the thrill of fighting. A Ravenclaw that gives up all morals in their search for knowledge. A Hufflepuff that is just so loyal to their friends that they don't care about anybody else and refuse to see the wrongs of their own side.

Or you could uplift Slytherin. Show how the house itself struggles with that kind of ideology and Voldemort's war. Show Slytherin as a split house that fights in itself. Show characters that for different reasons didn't follow that kind of thinking or even fight against it.

A hlaf-blood that sees the warning signs and comes to the conclusion that a regime like that would always need a scapegoat to work and they don't want to be around when all muggleborns are gone and people start to look at half-bloods.

A pureblood that is now at the very top of things and that doesn't want to risk it in a war, where they have everything to lose and little to gain.

Someone so convinced of themselves that refuse to say that their ancestors are what defines their worth, but their own abilities.

A shop owner that fights, because war is always bad for business.
