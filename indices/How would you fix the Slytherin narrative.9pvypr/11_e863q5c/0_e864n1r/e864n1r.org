  You know a Gryffindor battlefield commander that lives for the thrill of fighting. A Ravenclaw that gives up all morals in their search for knowledge. A Hufflepuff that is just so loyal to their friends that they don't care about anybody else and refuse to see the wrongs of their own side.

But that does not make Slytherin less shit. I like the idea, and it makes for a good narrative, but that does little to improve the overall image of Slytherin.

  A hlaf-blood that sees the warning signs and comes to the conclusion that a regime like that would always need a scapegoat to work and they don't want to be around when all muggleborns are gone and people start to look at half-bloods.

That one is the best suggestion so far.
