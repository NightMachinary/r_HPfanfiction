Like I said, you can lift Slytherin up to be closer to the rest or bring the rest down, to be closer to Slytherin.

But like I said I would prefer a dismantled Slytherin. You can still have Slytherin around as the 'lost house' and the heir of Slytherin, that has to be in another house (making it more logical for people to suspect Harry) and you could really make Slytherin the evil house, because if it gets disband because of it racist believes then people that choose to call themselves Slytherins would choose to, because they identify with those beliefs, like neo-nazis
