I don't think there's an easy fix, everything that I would consider a decent fix would be completely AU:

- put more DEs into other houses. Draco doesn't fit in Slytherin, put him in Gryffindor, but he remains just as evil. Maybe Snape was a Ravenclaw?

- The DEs recruit for their bigoted cult equally from all houses... maybe Slytherin is still slightly dominant, but not to an extreme

- DEs basically inspired by real terrorist organizations, where you truly don't know who the enemies are (JKR tried to do this, but failed hard, everyone is being an idiot for not catching on; sidenote: IMHO it wouldn't be an overreaction to disband Slytherin House in canon, since it's such a breeding ground)

- have named characters that are good (and/or neutral) in Slytherin who exemplify the positive qualities of their house in a non-evil way: clever, ambitious, cunning, foresight, sneaky

- get rid of all the "this is House-Evil"-symbolism. They don't live in the dungeons and everyone doesn't behave like gorillas. Most Slytherins are charming and nice, because they want to get ahead. Making enemies and openly being evil is stupid

- have racist/pure-blooded bigots from Slytherin who do not want to see the world burn and therefore still oppose Voldemort (any self respecting Slytherin won't bow down to him and getting tortured all day is not a great ambition)

- show examples of how the other House qualities can also be used to corrupt (Gryffindor and Ravenclaw are easy, Hufflepuff more difficult). On that note: Why does Pettigrew have to be a coward? "Oh, he wasn't a true Gryffindor, that's the only reason he was bad" -> way too easy. JKR clearly wanted Gryffindor to be the good house, because she can't commit.
