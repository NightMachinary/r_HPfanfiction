  She confirmed that the Third Reich was the inspiration (and they match the SA almost perfectly). The brownshirts were not exactly subtle or secretive.

She modeled them after the Third Reich during the war (or very close to the war). The Nazis were much more subtle and didn't gain public acclaim by immediately calling for the genocide of the jews and total war. I think I don't have to explain to you about the Hitlerjugend, Bund Deutscher MÃ¤dchen, improving conditions for workers, etc. There's good reasons why there was so little resistance to the Nazis and why the populace was generally enthusiastic about Hitler. The analogy IMHO falls very flat in that regard.

  Sadly, this is rather difficult to pull off in a school setting since most teenagers are not Machiavelli reincarnated. It tends to make characters Mary/Gary Stus instead. Or rather odd "I want to grow up and rule the world"-type of mentality.

That's true, but I think "Machiavellian" is a bit too grand. I've seen a few young people who were very ambitious, knew what they want and had a plan on how to get there. I don't think it's too hard to portray that as long as you let them still be kids to a degree - just more self-aware.

  The thing is, fair-play and chivalry

I'd focus more on prideful, brash, self-righteous and short-tempered here. Even "fair-play" could be corrupted into trying to help the underdog (pure bloods) who don't get what they deserve. It seems pretty easy to transfer modern alt-right talking points ("prevent white genocide") towards Gryffs.
