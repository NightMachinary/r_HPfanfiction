  DEs basically inspired by real terrorist organizations

She confirmed that the Third Reich was the inspiration (and they match the SA almost perfectly). The brownshirts were not exactly subtle or secretive.

  Hufflepuff more difficult

The proverb "loyal to a fault" comes to mind.

  Why does Pettigrew have to be a coward?
#+end_quote

Well, he is by far not the first to collaborate to be spared or even just killed a little later. For example, there were plenty of Jewish collaborators during the Final Solution.

  have racist/pure-blooded bigots from Slytherin who do not want to see the world burn and therefore still oppose Voldemort
#+end_quote

That is basically the fanon House Black (at least when Harry is banging one of them). But certainly one of the better avenues for a differentiated depiction.

  who exemplify the positive qualities of their house in a non-evil way: clever, ambitious, cunning, foresight, sneaky
#+end_quote

Sadly, this is rather difficult to pull off in a school setting since most teenagers are not Machiavelli reincarnated. It tends to make characters Mary/Gary Stus instead. Or rather odd "I want to grow up and rule the world"-type of mentality.

  The DEs recruit for their bigoted cult equally from all houses... maybe Slytherin is still slightly dominant, but not to an extreme
#+end_quote

The thing is, fair-play and chivalry kinda prohibit the motion of hunting down defenceless people and kill them for fun. And intelligence and wit rule out the belief in pureblood supremacy. There might be the odd few Hufflepuffs who believe that they are doing the right thing or Ravenclaws who think that Voldemort will help them discover hidden knowledge, but the way the sorting is done it will always be rigged towards Slytherin.
