Students complain to their parents. Or to other students, who then form a group and then complain to another teacher/their Head of House/Headmaster. I doubt even Dumbledore can ignore 40 students standing outside the gargoyle. Parents can come to discuss the issue, send howlers or regular mail, send complaints to the media?

​

Harry doesn't like asking for help and tries to deal with Snape's bullying himself, but all the others don't suffer from that. You can argue that muggleborns can't complain to their parents (assuming they don't get a say, since we never see them involved in school affairs), but the others sure can and will.

​

If this didn't happen, it wasn't as bad as we make it out to be(i.e Harry's presence made Snape worse than he usually is) or Dumbledore has complete dictatorship of the school or some influential people other than Dumbledore or controlled by Dumbledore(Hogwarts does have a Board of Governors) really wanted Snape in the school.
