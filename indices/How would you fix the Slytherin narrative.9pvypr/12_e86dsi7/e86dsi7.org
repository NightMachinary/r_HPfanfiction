About the Snape thing. That's ALL on Dumbledore. He hired Snape as a teacher. He could have given Snape any post. He made him a teacher. He overlooked all of Snape's actions. You mean to say that not one student tried to complain about Snape in his career? Snape as an ex-terrorrist didn't have any pull whatsoever.

Personally, I think it was deliberate. By making the 3 houses hate Slytherin, Voldemort can't recruit from them as easily.
