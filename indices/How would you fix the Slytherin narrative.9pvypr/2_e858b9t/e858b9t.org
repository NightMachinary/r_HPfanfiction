Well the first step would be breaking the 'One Slytherin' ideal of the house where Slytherin is a monolith and doing so with a ousting of Malfoy and or Snape, Malfoy is by far the most vocal Slytherin character in probably one of the most plugged in and promising years in Hogwarts with Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Susan Bones, a Weasley kid (his family has fingers in Dragons and Dragon Goods, Curse breaking, the Ministry and twin brothers who seemingly run Hogwarts black market) and that's just known plugs and those with major promise. By removing Malfoy as the Figure head of the students or removing Snape and his protection. We see a few times Snape manipulate Malfoy's aggressive bullying nature into detentions for Harry (which to me speaks more that Snape himself was a bit of a bully even in Hogwarts rather than just the victim Fanon portrays him).
