Well, first let's nix the idea that the Sorting actually means anything in the long run. It should be a way to sort the children equally into four houses for logistics purposes, nothing more. The houses are based on the four founders who themselves may have stood for certain ideals, but the actual houses are not the be-all end-all of your personality. The Sorting Hat might put you in Gryffindor to bolster your confidence a bit, or in Hufflepuff to socialize more, but beyond that it means nothing. It's not a personality test. You can be brave and righteous and still be a dick. You can be loyal and hardworking and still make nasty comments about people behind their back. You can be cunning and ambitious and still be a nice person. You can read all the books in the world and still be ignorant and self centered. Your house does not determine what kind of person you are.

Second let's dismiss the notion that you can't be non-Slytherin and racist against muggleborns at the same time. This is purely a cultural issue, not an indicator of your personality. You can be an overall pleasant person and still think muggleborn are the scum of the earth if that's what you've been taught growing up. Slytherin will have a greater concentration because that's where a lot of purebloods flock to, but they are by no means alone in their views.

Third, and back to the personality thing, /being in Slytherin House does not mean you're a bad person/. Ambition and cunning are not inherently bad traits. Want to be the best at literally anything? You have to be ambitious if you want to get anywhere. Have a natural inclination to wheedling favors out of your parents and friends? Well, that's quite cunning of you! Neither of those things mean you're going to drop everything and go lynch a muggleborn in their own home. Purebloods flock to Slytherin house for a lot of things: Legacy, tradition, expectations to succeed, and so on. If you've been groomed to inherit the family business, something many purebloods no doubt have, you're a shoe-in for Slytherin because succeeding at such requires both ambition and cunning in large amounts. But while there is a concentration of purebloods in Slytherin, I doubt it's even half the people in there. The rest are people who are simply naturally cunning and/or have a drive to succeed, and you don't get far in life if you're mean and nasty to other people. Pureblood Slytherin children are just the vocal minority, so they get the most attention.

I also like to imagine that Slytherin has a friendly rivalry with Ravenclaw due to both houses' need for good grades.

Now, I freely admit that I have no real idea of how to frame this in a realistic way. Accurate socioeconomic and political world building is beyond me right now, which I think is actually the problem: Rowling's portrayal of Slytherin house is not representative of reality. There's no room in it, narratively speaking, for people who aren't evil. I think to actually have a chance at fixing it, you need to disassociate Slytherin house from Voldemort and the Pureblood ideology. It's a societal issue, not a House issue.

And if what I said doesn't make sense, there is a very real chance you are correct and I'm just spewing jargon.
