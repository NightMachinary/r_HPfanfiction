I'm convinced that Slytherin was originally meant to be the "evil House", but this creates some problems (like why keep Slytherin at all and not disband it) so JK Rowling made some effort to redeem it towards the end but it wasn't very convincing imo. I know many people disagree with me, but I don't see how Slytherin was not the "evil house" when even people like Dumbledore don't bother defending it (remember his conversation with Harry in CoS where Harry was worried that he was meant to be in Slytherin and Dumbledore basically made 0 effort to defend the House)

Slytherin cannot be fixed without radical changes even at book 1. They should have just disbanded it in the end.
