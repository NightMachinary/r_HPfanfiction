It's a combination of indoctrination, herd mentality and the values one needs to be sorted in the house.

​

Slytherin might have been created as the antagonists, but this is a childrens book. When we look at it from an adult perspective, it doesn't work that way. Slytherins value ambition, cunning, leadership, and resourcefulness. Blood purity wasn't a criteria. Half bloods and the occasional muggleborns do get sorted there. If the Sorting Hat never actually bothered with peoples choices while sorting, I'm sure many sortings would go differently.

​

Say Slytherin house was abolished, would that actually solve the problem? The concept of blood purity would still exist. Abolishing a house to solve the Death Eater menace is like cutting off a leg after a snakebite rather than administering antivenin.
