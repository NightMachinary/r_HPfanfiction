At least we were told that some Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws stayed to fight . With Slytherin it is different, as they're kinda signled out as the Voldemort sympathizers. I believe only Slughorn from Slytherin really fought with the good guys (and of course Snape, but lets be honest , Snape was still an asshole)
