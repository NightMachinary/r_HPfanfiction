I would "fix" it by showing how the indoctrination works. Have Harry talk to a decent guy on the train, who gets sorted into Slytherin. And then gradually show how the guy turns into a bigot because he is in a house full of bigots led by a bully. Have him face the trio and get killed at the end of book 7.

Or pull a Draco and have the guy break down when he actually has to murder muggleborns and it's not just all talk anymore, and he goes to Scrimgeour and turns crown witness. Cue the Aurors cleaning house and Draco and co. getting sent to Azkaban, the whole sixth year plot getting derailed, and the Malfoys murdered by Voldemort. And Dumbledore is, in his last months, forced to help Scrimgeour clean out the Ministry with prejudice, pretty much conducting a witch hunt for bigots and former Slytherins - which, especially those who aren't Death Eaters, would quickly turn on their more militant/radical "friends" to save themselves, which would erase Voldemort's support in the Ministry (through loss of bigots sympathetic to his cause, actual spies, and potential sympathisers now tainted in his eyes through their betrayal) enough to stop his takeover (and also send a lot of innocents to Azkaban, if, for some fucked up reason, Scrimgeour, as in canon, wouldn't dose up everyone on Veritaserum.)
