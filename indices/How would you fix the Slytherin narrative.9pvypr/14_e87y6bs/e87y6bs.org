If you want to fix house Slytherin, you need to show its members slapping down Draco - hard. Whenever Draco says something bigoted or does something supporting Blood purity, he needs to be publically stomped by others of his house. None of that "House Unity" shit. "House Unity" means, even though the Slytherin/pureblood fanboys don't realise it, that you indoctrinate future Death Eaters because everyone will see you as bigots for not opposing Draco in public - and rightfully so.

So, you can't fix Slytherin without changing canon massively. As long as Draco can act as in canon, Slytherin won't be fixed. The only way he can get away with his antics is if he's got the support of the rest of his house. (Or if everyone in his house is an idiot who doesn't realise what Draco means for their image - which pretty much means the whole cunning and ambitious part is non-existent.)
