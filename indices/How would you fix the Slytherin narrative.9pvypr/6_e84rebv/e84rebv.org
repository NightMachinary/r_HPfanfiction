  Pretty much the only decent person to canonically come from there is Andromeda Tonks...

Horace Slughorn, Merlin, Alphard Black, even (to some degree) Severus Snape--all were largely praiseworthy in canon. It's not clear from canon that there wasn't representation of Death Eaters from other Hogwarts houses. We only know a handful of Death Eaters' Hogwarts houses definitively and we do know there were non-Hogwarts Death Eaters (Karkaroff) and sympathizers (Greyback). Hagrid's comments in Book 1 were from a biased, unreliable source: recall at the time that he believed Sirius Black, a Gryffindor, to be Voldemort's right-hand man.

Setting that aside, supposing that indeed nearly all Death Eaters came from Slytherin, a way to handle this would be to draw parallels between the First Wizarding War and the American Civil War. Most who fought for the Confederacy were not themselves slave owners and benefited little from the practice of slavery. In fact, were slavery abolished, the demand for poor, white labor would have increased markedly and improved their lots in life. But they were enticed into fighting for their collective identity, honor, and culture, which they felt were being compromised by the North at the time. They also fought for their brothers and for charismatic leaders. And they fought because they thought they were fighting on the right side. In terms of the values and norms of the day, there really wasn't an obvious "good" side to the conflict, at least at first. Lincoln famously stated in his first inaugural address that he had "...no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so." This was hardly the stern denouncement of a practice we look back upon today as morally despicable and establishing a moral delineation of sides in the conflict.

Similarly, the House of Slytherin could be rehabilitated in fanfiction by portraying the first war in morally ambiguous terms, at least at the outset. Perhaps the depravity of Tom Riddle and his movement only became evident late in the war and was embellished in the telling, history being defined by the winners. Recall from canon that there was plenty of blood on both sides' hands. Dumbledore, despite holding high political offices and, presumably, having a means of effecting an official resistance, instead led an extralegal guerilla force. Moody was a terror. The Aurors in the first war had license to use the Unforgivables. Barty Crouch abused his office and imprisoned people in Azkaban without trial or testimony.
