  Horace Slughorn
#+end_quote

Kept shut about the Horcruxes and enabled Voldemort's return, or at the very least made the hunt unnecessarily difficult because they only had two years instead of nearly two decades. He also told Voldemort about the Horcruxes despite the fact that it was obvious that they were not having an academic discussion.

Predates Hogwarts by a couple of centuries

  Severus Snape

Fucked an entire generation by starving them of applicants qualified for jobs which require higher potion knowledge, bullied children by abusing his power as a teacher, voluntarily joined the Death Eaters

I give you that one.

  And they fought because they thought they were fighting on the right side

  In terms of the values and norms of the day, there really wasn't an obvious "good" side to the conflict, at least at first

  Recall from canon that there was plenty of blood on both sides' hands.
#+end_quote

He apparently had very little power he could leverage, given how quick Fudge could oust him. And that argument is so horribly, horribly wrong if you apply it to real history (eg the second World War had no good side because everyone had blood on their hands, even the Warsaw Ghetto uprising).

  Moody was a terror.

Heydrich was a terror, Moody was an efficient SWAT/GSG9/SCO19 officer forced to fight a civil war against magical fascists.

  Barty Crouch abused his office and imprisoned people in Azkaban without trial or testimony.
#+end_quote

Point there, although many believe that he was a Slytherin.
