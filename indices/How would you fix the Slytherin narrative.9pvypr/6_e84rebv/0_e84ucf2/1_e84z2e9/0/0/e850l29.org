  He was the only teacher who did so

As I said, that's his right to set the bar. I've had my professors deny taking students on for far less than grades. It is completely the professor's prerogative.

  he needed to pick Slughorn's brain about making multiple.

Again, as I said before, if he didn't pick Slughorn's brain, then he'd find it out from somewhere else. You seem to want to cling to the idea that Slughorn is responsible for LV's reign - he really isn't. If anything, blame Dumbledore. He knew there was foul play involved with TMR, Hagrid, and the Chamber - he did nothing then.

I also notice that you've got nothing to say towards the scenario I described where Slughorn does inform AD about the horcruxes. Poor Slughorn. Damned if he tells people, damned if he doesn't.

  neither Ron nor Harry really struggled with the subject.

HP only does well in Potions because of Snape's book - none of it is his work. As for Ron, his Draught of Living Death resembled tar instead of the purple colour if I recall correctly
