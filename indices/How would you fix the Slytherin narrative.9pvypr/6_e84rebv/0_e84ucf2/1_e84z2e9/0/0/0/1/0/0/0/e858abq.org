Dumbledore in 81 was not the same person as he was in 96. And a random sneeze or the reflection of the sun might be enough to distract him enough from the compulsion to first destroy the Horcrux and then take the stone. It would actually be rather odd for him to die in the exact same fashion a decade and a half earlier.
