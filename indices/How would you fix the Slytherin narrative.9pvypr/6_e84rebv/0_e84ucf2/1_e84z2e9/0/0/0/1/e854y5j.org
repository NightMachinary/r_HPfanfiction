As I said, why not place greater blame on Dumbledore? Everyone else fell for the charming persona that Riddle showed the world, but not Dumbledore. AD knew that there was foul play regarding the Chamber of Secrets, but he didn't do anything - even though a student died as a result.

Also, you didn't address the scenario where Slughorn does tell AD and AD gets killed a year early.
