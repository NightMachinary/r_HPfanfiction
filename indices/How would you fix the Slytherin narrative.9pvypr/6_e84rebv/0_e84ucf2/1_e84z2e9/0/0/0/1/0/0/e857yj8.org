  assumed Dumbledore was told in 81. There would be a lot more people still alive who could have given clues, thus making it unlikely that he would have died the same way. I'm not saying that Dumbledore would have dealt with them in a breeze but to assume the exact same outcome relies on a lot of coincidences,

No, I meant the part where Voldemort recognises the dis-figuration on Dumbledore's hand as a result of the curse on his ring and takes steps to ensure that his horcruxes are better protected. Because, you know it, AD is getting cursed by the ring no matter what - the temptation of the Stone is too much for him, given his history. After Voldemort figures this out, he would likely torture Slughorn and interrogate him about the people he's told it to. He'll then hunt them down and kill them. Then, he'd just move his horcruxes to another location. And maybe, since the Ring and possibly the Locket are destroyed, he'll do the smart thing and chuck one of his horcruxes into the bottom of the ocean.

And Dumbledore was never going to get the Diadem (because it was hidden inside a room packed with stuff, not to mention the fact that it was a pretty ballsy move hiding a piece of his soul right under Dumbledore's nose) or the Diary or the Cup, because ironically enough, Dumbledore would never think that Voldemort would entrust his followers with pieces of his soul, even if they are ignorant of what he's giving them.
