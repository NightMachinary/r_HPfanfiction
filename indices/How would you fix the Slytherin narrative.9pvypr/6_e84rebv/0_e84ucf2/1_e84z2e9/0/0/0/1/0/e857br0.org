  As I said, why not place greater blame on Dumbledore?
#+end_quote

I never claimed that Dumbledore is a saint (although I would rather blame him for child abuse and not for the Riddle mess since he did not orchestrate it to the same degree and he held no position of power yet). I am merely pointing out that Slughorn royally fucked up. I mean, even if it was purely academic, it was still basically allowing him access to a room full of enriched uranium. Slughorn might not have built the bomb, but he sure as hell helped, even if through negligence rather than out of malice.

  Also, you didn't address the scenario where Slughorn does tell AD and AD gets killed a year early

I assumed Dumbledore was told in 81. There would be a lot more people still alive who could have given clues, thus making it unlikely that he would have died the same way. I'm not saying that Dumbledore would have dealt with them in a breeze but to assume the exact same outcome relies on a lot of coincidences,
