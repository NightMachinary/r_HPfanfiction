Thank Christ for a reasonable comment. Too many people think that if you're not apart of the Order of the Phoenix or the D.A., then you're not a good person. Just because you're not out actively fighting and putting your life at risk doesn't mean you are a shit person. It just means that you're not brave. Being brave and being good are not mutually exclusive. Neutrality and doing what you can to survive is a completely reasonable thing to do, not everyone is a hero.
