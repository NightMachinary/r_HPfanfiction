  It would actually be rather odd for him to die in the exact same fashion a decade and a half earlier.

Not as odd as you would think to be honest. '81 Dumbledore just came out of a war. If he finds the resurrection stone, there is a significant chance he would want to use it for more than just seeing his sister. That close to the end of the war, there is a significant chance he would want to see people who had just died. Hell, he might even really want to call back the Potters to find out what happened.
