  Dumbledore in 81 was not the same person as he was in 96.
#+end_quote

In what way is he different?

He takes James' cloak for "inspection" in 81 when he sees it for what it is. In the HP hallucinations chapter, AD clearly says how the stone would have completed the set. "After all these years, I had two hallows in my possession!", or something to that effect.

  And a random sneeze or the reflection of the sun might be enough to distract him enough from the compulsion

I doubt it. He specifically says that the compulsion is exponentially stronger when it is something the victim desires anyway.
