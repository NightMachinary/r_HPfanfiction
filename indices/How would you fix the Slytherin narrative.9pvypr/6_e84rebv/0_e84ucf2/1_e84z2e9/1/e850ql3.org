  You know, I hate Snape, but your idea that he fucked up an entire generation by starving them of potions knowledge is a complete fanon idea. There's no evidence from canon to support any of that. Canon is how HP perceives things - if he perceives Snape to be a bad teacher, then that is how it will be shown.

He was a bad teacher. Pointing at instructions and saying "Do it or you're an idiot" is shitty teaching. Bullying Harry and worse, Neville, is something you cannot dispute as just being Harry's viewpoint. It was bad enough Hermione had to do Snape's job for him and assist Neville.

Calling it a fanon idea is ludicrous.
