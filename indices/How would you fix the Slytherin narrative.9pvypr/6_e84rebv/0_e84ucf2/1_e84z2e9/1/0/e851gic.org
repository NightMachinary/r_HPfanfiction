  Calling it a fanon idea is ludicrous.

Learn to read what I wrote - I said that the idea of Snape somehow sabotaging a generation of aurors and healers is a fanon idea.

You do realise that canon can easily skip parts where Snape teaches about theory (because including theory in a children's book is retarded), don't you? The whole "Instructions are on the board" routine could just as easily be a class that comes after a theory class where the potion is explained and taught properly.

Also, I've had bad teachers, and compared to them Snape is pretty mediocre. I've had bad teachers several times. Including in my Masters degree. You wanna know what I did when I had bad teachers? I sucked it up, studied the subjects by myself and passed with good marks.

You know what HP and Neville don't do? Study the fucking subject matter by themselves.
