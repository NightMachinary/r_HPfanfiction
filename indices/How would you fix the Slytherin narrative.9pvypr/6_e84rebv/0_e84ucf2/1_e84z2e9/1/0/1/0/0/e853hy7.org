  He's consistently shown as that because that's what HP deems important enough to narrate - that is it.

You know it's odd that the other classes have the teachers actually helping the students as opposed "instructions on thee board, do them". There is not a single instant of Snape doing what you're supposing, so you literally have nothing but supposition. The other classes have it, Snape doesnt, he's describes as just insulting those who do it poorly (because he didn't show them how) and otherwise ignoring them.

  I've had shitty teachers in many of my classes, including chemistry, physics and biology back in middle and high school. I still sucked it up, just like everyone in my class. None of us bothered wasting time by whinging, "boo hoo he's a shit teacher, wahh". We got our work done.

You are a confirmed idiot who cannot follow a point. My entire argument was that Snape is a shitty teacher. Your only responses have been "But I had shitty teachers too". Congrats, irrelevant. Shitty teachers ruin prospects for many people. As it happens (see countries like Finland) when you have good teachers the students tend to do better.

But I suppose following simple points like "Bad teachers tend to produce bad students" wasn't covered by your shitty teachers so you didn't pick the skill up.
