I have personal experience with that. I despised math growing up. But my third calculus teacher was frigging awesome. Not only was he a funny guy with a pension for going philosophical (a lot of math gets hard to conceptualize at a certain point), but he actually gave a damn about being clear in his explanations. I ended up minoring in math because he made it something I could enjoy when taught how to really get it.

I'm no Einstein obviously but it's self-evident that teachers have an enormous influence in the classroom performance and on who ends up in different careers.
