This whole thread is about OP asking about Slytherins. Canon always says Slytherins are EVIL^{TM.} I don't think so, because canon has a lot of bias against them, just as it has towards Snape as a teacher.

  Note how Harry and Ron, who were routinely berated by Snape, actually did well once away from his influence

Uh-huh. Go read the chapter again, dipshit. Ron's Draught of Living Death was completely messed up, in spite of not having the Dread Bully to sabotage it. The only reason HP gets it right is because he mooches off of another's work.

Perhaps this is different in Sensitive Land where you come from, but for the rest of us, we soldier on in spite of Dreaded Bully^{TM} teachers. The idea that bad teachers will stop students from applying themselves might be the case in Sensitive Land, but is thankfully not so in the rest of the world, where people have a bit of spine and self-belief.
