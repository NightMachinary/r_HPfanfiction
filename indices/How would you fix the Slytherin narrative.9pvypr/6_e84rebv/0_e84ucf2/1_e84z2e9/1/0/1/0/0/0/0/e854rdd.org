  HP hates Snape. He isn't going to paint him in a positive light at all.

So in other words, the actual things in the story are only acceptable to point out when you say so. Kay.

  My point was that Snape never ruined his country's auror or healer department. You are the moron who turned that into an argument about Snape's competence. Snape is a fairly mediocre teacher as far as they go.

Yeah except a really obvious observation: Potions is required for many careers. Snape teaches potions poorly, to the extent of bullying his own students. Ergo, there will be a smaller supply of people in careers requiring Potions. So yes, Snape being a shitty teacher makes it obvious that's the case. Note how Harry and Ron, who were routinely berated by Snape, actually did well once away from his influence. It's almost like... yes, causality is thing.

  Scandinavia? What a joke. Are you one of those sensitive people? Do you need a safe space when people yell at you?

HAHAHA. Great non-argument. So in other words we ignore proven success and resort to childish shit (notice how i didn't mention anything about sensitivity) because it disproves your completely deluded view of things? Amazing, can't believe I didn't come up with flat convenient tactic. It would get me as many miles as its surely gotten you.
