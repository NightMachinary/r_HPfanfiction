Just imagine if Einstein had a teacher like Snape in Maths or in Physics, instilling a hatred for the subject in a young Albert.

I don't think it's much of a stretch to say that in his many years of teaching Snape has deprived Wizarding Britain of multiple potions experts and maybe a genius or two.
