I can't believe that you guys are having a debate about whether having a terrible teacher results in less students being interested or good at the subject.

How is this debatable?

I have experienced multiple times in my life how interest in a subject, that I wouldn't have considered otherwise, was awakened by a passionate and dedicated teacher. Even if I were mildly interested in potions I wouldn't pursue it at Hogwarts because of Snape.
