  . I don't think so, because canon has a lot of bias against them, just as it has towards Snape as a teacher.

There is not a single instance of anyone disagreeing with Harry's assessment of Snape. Only agreement.

  Uh-huh. Go read the chapter again, dipshit. Ron's Draught of Living Death was completely messed up, in spite of not having the Dread Bully to sabotage it. The only reason HP gets it right is because he mooches off of another's work.

Go reread OoTP and HBP again, moron. Harry and Ron, who demonstrably did poor in Snape's presence, managed an EE on their OWL (Slughorn's passing grade). So in other words, Snape is a shitty teacher who's "teaching" style demonstrably produced worse results that otherwise. Even the series outright shows your view to be ridiculous.

  Perhaps this is different in Sensitive Land where you come from, but for the rest of us, we soldier on in spite of Dreaded BullyTM teachers. The idea that bad teachers will stop students from applying themselves might be the case in Sensitive Land, but is thankfully not so in the rest of the world, where people have a bit of spine and self-belief.

So as I said, you simply ignore the reality of nations with better education /results/ because it disproves your idiotic belief that children and their grades are not influenced by the quality of their teachers. I'm sorry, I'll be sure to account for your intellectual deficiencies from now on. ðŸ‘Œ

  Yawn. You're like a broken record, aren't you? Bully, bully, bully, bully...
#+end_quote

I know you have no response, but have some shame when you avoid the undeniable point. I mean it's like adults shouldn't be shitty to children because they feel like it. Astounding, it's almost like basic ethics...
