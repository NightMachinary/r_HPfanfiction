  Harry and Ron, who demonstrably did poor in Snape's presence, managed an EE on their OWL (Slughorn's passing grade)
#+end_quote

And you skipped the part where the two of them revise for about a couple weeks straight? They do their schoolwork for once and they get good grades - the rest of time, they're busy cheating on their homework, and get shitty grades. It isn't a difficult leap to make, but you're a retard...oops, sorry, you're differently abled, that's right.

It ought to be obvious, but to someone like you, I guess it isn't.

  anyone disagreeing with Harry's assessment of Snape. Only agreement.
#+end_quote

The Headmaster disagrees with HP's assessment almost all the time.

  reality of nations with better education

Too bad Scandinavia with all the wondrous education won't last longer than a few more decades.

  children are not influence by the quality of their teachers
#+end_quote

Teachers are, in fact, a minor influence. Children are much more influenced by their families and friends.

But hey, sensitive people need those safe spaces with teachers, I guess. Anyway, I've wasted enough time here.
