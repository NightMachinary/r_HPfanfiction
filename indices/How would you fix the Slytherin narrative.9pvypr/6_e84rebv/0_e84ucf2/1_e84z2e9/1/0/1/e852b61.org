Let's see what you said:

  but your idea that he fucked up an entire generation by starving them of potions knowledge is a complete fanon idea.

Seriously, his shitty teaching would - unless you're an idiot who can't do simple inferences - obviously fuck over many who are expecting a competent teacher.

  You do realise that canon can easily skip parts where Snape teaches about theory (because including theory in a children's book is retarded), don't you? The whole "Instructions are on the board" routine could just as easily be a class that comes after a theory class where the potion is explained and taught properly.

You are either an idiot who misses obvious points or you haven't read the books. I didn't complain that the series didn't over fictional theories. I said there's never any indication that Snape actually teaches his students how to do anything. He's consistently shown as "Do this, my job is done".

And the difference is (I happen to be in grad school atm) that those are kids, you're a grown ass adult. We don't treat kids like adults, especially not in a magical chemistry class.

You know what Snape did in nearly every appearance that I can guarantee your teachers did not do? Bully children repeatedly. Actual bullying, not just being mean.
