That's fanon right there. That 'maybe' is fanon.

You're also assuming that only the top 10 percent of all students get the O grade, instead of all students who score above a cut-off, like 90 percent score in the exam.

Besides, the students who want to become aurors and healers know what the limits are - they need to work for it. You have these things in the real world as well, like your chances of getting into the university with a full scholarship would be much higher if your grades were A+ compared to a B.

Also, it is the Ministry that conducts the standardised exams, not the school. Studemts can just as easily take the exams by studying by themselves and applying to the Healers and Aurors with a passing grade in the NEWTs.
