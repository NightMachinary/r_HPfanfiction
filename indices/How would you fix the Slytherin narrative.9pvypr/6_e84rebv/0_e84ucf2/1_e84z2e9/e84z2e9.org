  Fucked an entire generation by starving them of applicants qualified for jobs which require higher potion knowledge, bullied children by abusing his power as a teacher, voluntarily joined the Death Eaters

You know, I hate Snape, but your idea that he fucked up an entire generation by starving them of potions knowledge is a complete fanon idea. There's no evidence from canon to support any of that. Canon is how HP perceives things - if he perceives Snape to be a bad teacher, then that is how it will be shown. If you want to talk about him only accepting students with an O into higher classes, well, a lot of professors in university do the same as well - it is their right to set their standards.

  Kept shut about the Horcruxes and enabled Voldemort's return, or at the very least made the hunt unnecessarily difficult because they only had two years instead of nearly two decades. He also told Voldemort about the Horcruxes despite the fact that it was obvious that they were not having an academic discussion.

I'm going to say that Slughorn had no idea if Voldemort was still alive or not after 1981 - no one did. HP's shenanigans at school weren't really a thing that was advertised to the general public - which was why the Ministry had to send Hagrid away in the first place in 2nd year - so Slughorn didn't know Voldemort was around in the first place.

And secondly, even if he did tell AD about the Horcruxes, what would they do? Where would they begin to search? AD only confirmed that LV made horcruxes upon seeing the diary, and even then, it took him 3-4 years before he found the next one. Without the diary, he wouldn't have made any progress at all.

Thirdly, and this is something I wrote as a comment before, imagine Slughorn telling AD about the horcruxes and AD finding the ring immediately after 4th year. He gets cursed and is killed at the end of fifth year. The Ministry falls into disarray during 1996. LV also identifies the reason for Dumbledore's blackened hand, and kills Slughorn to clean up a loose end. LV then reigns supreme. Would you say that all of that is Slughorn's fault, because he didn't tell anyone at the "right moment"? Because your statement that LV surviving or learning how to make Horcruxes is somehow Slughorn's fault.

Get real. If TMR didn't find out about them from Slughorn, he would have found out from somewhere else.

Your last line about the discussion not being academic is also untrue. TMR was always described as a charismatic and charming boy by all accounts. No one, and I mean no one, would think that the bright, intelligent and talented 15-16 year old prodigy is going to become a megalomaniac.
