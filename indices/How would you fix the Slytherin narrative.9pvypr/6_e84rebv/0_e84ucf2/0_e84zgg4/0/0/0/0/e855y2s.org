No idea, but I guess the HP verse only has the second one. The first one is an anglo-saxon legend, I think.

I think he was more like an incredibly powerful wizard who laid the foundations of modern wizarding Britain. I don't think he was a religious figure of any kind, because canon is just bad where wizarding culture is concerned.
