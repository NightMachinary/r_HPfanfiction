A couple of those I'm not sure about. Merlin attended Hogwarts, that much we know, as he was in Slytherin. So this could mean Hogwarts - stated to be about 1000 years old - was founded in the 900s or the time period of the Arthuric legends occurred a century later than purported in reality.

Also not.clear about Slughorn. All indications seem to be that he did think it was an academic discussion. I don't think he realized Voldemort actually did it until either when his body was destroyed (Crouch Sr. makes it clear to his son at the trial that the Ministry knew Voldemort survived his body's destruction) or when his return became public. I'm not sure because I don't think we were told exactly hen Slughorn went into hiding.
