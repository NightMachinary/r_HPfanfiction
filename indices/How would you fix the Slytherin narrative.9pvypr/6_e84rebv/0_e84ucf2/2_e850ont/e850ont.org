Well, you did ask how /I/ would fix the Slytherin narrative. Given the prompt, I took the time frame for the rehabilitation to be "At the start of the series." Given the sub, I took the prompt to mean, "How would I do it plausibly, while staying largely faithful to canon?"

I offered two ways: The first, the cop-out many writers use, is to basically pepper Death Eaters among all the Hogwarts houses. Boring, but not implausible.

The second (to me) is the more interesting choice: remove the moral impetus from the first war and make it a Hatfield vs. McCoy thing instead of good vs. evil, at least at its outset. This would have the benefit of allowing more interesting conflict among characters. It would also present Slytherin as less a cesspool of evil than simply a bunch of people who hold different values, proclivities, and cultural norms.

I treated it as a thought experiment, though I sense from the tone of your response that I've somehow missed the mark. For that I apologize.
