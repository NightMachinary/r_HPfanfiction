  Well, you did ask how I would fix the Slytherin narrative
#+end_quote

I did not dispute that at all. I agree with your overall narrative (many did not realise how bad Riddle would be), but that leaves the second war unexplained. Voldemort could not have killed all Death Eaters if they chose to desert (or not return to his side). Yet he summons them out of nowhere and they all appear in regalia within 5 minutes.

What I am asking for is how to make Slytherin during Harry's time appear less like a genocidal shithole without whitewashing the Death Eaters or using the one "good Slytherin" as a token.
