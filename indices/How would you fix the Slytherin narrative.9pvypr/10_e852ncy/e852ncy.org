I think more broadly the underlying question that's really interesting is about "fixing" canon in general. Making the world-building more thorough and consistent, and presenting Hogwarts houses for what they are - shared dorms in school - rather than how they're perceived in the fandom, "immutable character traits that define your friends and your future and your whole life OMG ANYTHING BUT SLYTHERIN!"

I'd love to see a second or third year Harry interacting with adults far outside the Hogwart's sphere react with confusion and condescenion like "what? Huffleduff? That's one of those Hogwarts dorms, yeah? Who gives a shit where schoolchildren slept at night?" and then another adult laughs, "Yeah I was a Hoggy kid, too, sorted into Ravenclaw. Can't say as I kept in touch with any of those egg-heads I dormed with, and the most effective hit-wizards I work with now are guys educated abroad."

or some such.
