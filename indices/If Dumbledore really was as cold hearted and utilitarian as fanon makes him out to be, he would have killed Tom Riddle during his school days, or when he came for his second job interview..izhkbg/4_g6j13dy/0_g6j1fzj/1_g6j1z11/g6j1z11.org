Mind you I am a teenager too, but yeah I get that point. If Dumbledore did go sharing his plans with everyone who asked, Voldemort and him would be best pals. Everyone thinks that Dumbledore does nothing good for Harry, but nobody considers that the whole world looks up to Dumbledore and he has to do what is best for the world.

Then also he tried to give Harry a chance, knowing that if he simply gave Harry to Voldemort or asked Snape to do so, defeating Voldemort would have be a piece of cake from there on.
