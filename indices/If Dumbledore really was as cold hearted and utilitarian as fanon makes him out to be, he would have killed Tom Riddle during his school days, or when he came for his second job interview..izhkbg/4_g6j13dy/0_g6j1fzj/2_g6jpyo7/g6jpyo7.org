All very true - but that misses a crucial point. Dumbledore wasn't in the military, nor was he a military leader.

Churchill had the moral and political authority to sacrifice Coventry because he was elected by his people to pursue a war in which they all knew they'd have to make sacrifices. He didn't have to go to Coventry to get their consent again.

A military officer has similar authority to send people into battles where some will surely die.

But not Dumbledore. We don't have any evidence that he has the consent of any of those he makes decisions for. I see no evidence for any sort of legitimate authority to place Harry with the Dursleys, for endangering the school with the Stone, and so forth. Being a professor gives him no such authority. Being headmaster gives him no such authority. His political positions might be fair candidates, but we have no evidence that they suffice.

Yet, at the same time, it's likely that his decisions were correct. And this is what makes him a complex and interesting character. He is almost certainly making the right decisions for the right reasons, but lacks the legal, moral, or political authority to be doing so. He's basically imposing his decisions on others through sheer force of will, personal reputation, and magical power.

And thus different people will read the same actions in very different ways. If you're more an “ends” sort of person, you'll focus on that and approve because his goals were good and, moreover, succeeded. If you're more an “means” sort of person, you will at the very least be incredibly bothered by the way he's doing things, regardless of his motives or goals.

Writing a fanfic that focuses on one more than the other isn't inherently wrong; on the contrary, focusing more on certain aspects of his character, actions, and personality can do a lot to help us see those complexities more clearly. A book about how people in Coventry suffered wouldn't be enough to understand all of WWII, or even all of the British experience of WWII, but it would provide valuable insight into how the “right” decisions can come with a terrible cost to others.
