Rowling wrote herself into a huge corner.

I don't think Manipulative!Dumbledore being so popular is solely because fanfic writers are immature teenagers, I think it's because it is extremely easy to put together an Alex Jones level of conspiracy out of the HP canon. From the Sacred 28 family with 7 kids breaking the SoS in the middle of London in book 1, all the way to setting up Harry to die in book 7, if you look at it from a certain angle, it's very easy to make up a conspiracy theory.

What I hate about this situation is that it is definitely unintentional on Rowling's part, and deals a big blow to one of her best characters (ie Dumbledore).
