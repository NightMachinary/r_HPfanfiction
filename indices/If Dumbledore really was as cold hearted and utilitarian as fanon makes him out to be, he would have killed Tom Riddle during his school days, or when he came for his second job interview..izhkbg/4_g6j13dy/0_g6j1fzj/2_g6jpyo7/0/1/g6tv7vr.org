I think that might be because he could have proved Sirius innocent, if he knew who the secret keeper was. But we all know Sirius to be a little more... Temperamental, you can say. Even if he didn't want to, Dumbledore knew that Harry needed to be sacrificed, all that mattered was the correct time. Sirius wouldn't have accepted this, the Magical Britain as well as the magical World wouldn't have accepted it. Sirius would try to save Harry, but we know that due to the prophecy Harry wasn't safe from Voldemort until either of them died. Harry might have died at a time when his sacrifice would have no value and Voldemort ruled the world.

Dumbledore was a great man, Even if he made mistakes. I'll quote what said in one of my comments here, something that is quite famous, "With great powers come great responsibilities".
