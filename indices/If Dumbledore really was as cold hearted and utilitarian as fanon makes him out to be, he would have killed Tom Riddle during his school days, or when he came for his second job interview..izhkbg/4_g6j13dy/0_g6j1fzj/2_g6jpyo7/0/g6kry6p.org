You also have to figure in that he probably suspected that Death Eaters escaped justice and probably influential in Fudge's ministry.

My biggest concern is Sirius and if the Potter family told Dumbledore that he was the secret keeper. If Dumbledore didn't know about the change then why didn't he know and why didn't he seemingly question Sirius innocence? Surely he would have questioned why Sirius let Hagrid runaway on his motorcycle with Harry. Surely Sirius had more magical knowledge then Hagrid and if he was a death eater he would have done something to him and Harry. I'm also curious on why he had Harry's bank key. While he most likely didn't trust the Dursely family with the money it gets to question how he got it in the first place.
