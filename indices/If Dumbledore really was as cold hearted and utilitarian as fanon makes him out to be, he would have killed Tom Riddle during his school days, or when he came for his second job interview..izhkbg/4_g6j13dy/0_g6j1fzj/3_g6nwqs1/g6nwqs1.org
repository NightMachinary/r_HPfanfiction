The problem I have with the comparison you offer is that a captain in a modern army would be making decisions concerning /adults/.

Throughout the books, and especially in the Battle of Hogwarts, most of the "good guy" fighters are in their mid-teens. If your "underground militia" needs to rely primarily on child soldiers, then something has gone very, very wrong.
