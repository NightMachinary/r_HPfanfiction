Yeah, it really frustrates me too. I mean, Dumbledore could have destroyed Harry by labelling him as a dark wizard more powerful than Voldemort but didn't. As for the potter inheritance, I think he that he wouldn't need money for at least 6 to 7 lifetimes, what with him holding such high positions and all.

Really, I have stopped reading fanfics, because most of them are just made around this theme. I mean, nobody wants to accept that he could be any good.

I think this one nearly meets you standards. Although it is incomplete, it is a more serious story, unlike fanfics where Harry is a lucky fairy who can destroy anything with a swoosh of a wand- [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13320880/1/Phoenix-Insurgent]]
