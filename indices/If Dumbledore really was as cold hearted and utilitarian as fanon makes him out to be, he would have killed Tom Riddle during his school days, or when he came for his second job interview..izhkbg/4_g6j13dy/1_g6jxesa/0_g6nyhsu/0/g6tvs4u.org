Now that's a Dumbledore I like more. :D

I mean, this is what I prefer about Dumbledore. Something that I am not able to express in words. If anyone ever said something like what you said, "Oh such a terrible shame.....", an image of Dumbledore would always pop up into my mind. He was a great man, but misunderstood.
