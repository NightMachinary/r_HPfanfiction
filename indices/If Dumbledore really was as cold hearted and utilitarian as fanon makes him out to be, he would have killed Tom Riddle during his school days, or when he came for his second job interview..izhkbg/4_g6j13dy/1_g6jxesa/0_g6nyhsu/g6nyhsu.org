Seconded. I haven't read all of it yet, but Dumbledore's portrayal in the fic is much more in line with his image in the earlier books - eccentric, grandfatherly, and skilled beyond measure. When Harry and Dumbledore get expelled and fired, respectively, Albus just goes "Oh such a terrible shame that I now need a job while Mr Potter must find a tutor. I wish you the best of luck in dealing with the madhouse that is Hogwarts." Peak Dumbledore, that.
