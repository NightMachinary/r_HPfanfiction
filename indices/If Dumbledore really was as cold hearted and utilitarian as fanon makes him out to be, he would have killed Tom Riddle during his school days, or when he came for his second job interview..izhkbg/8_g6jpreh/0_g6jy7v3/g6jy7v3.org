I totally agree - and they do the same to one of the other nuanced characters in the series: Severus Snape. Only they do it the other way around. Suddenly Snape is whiter than white, better than good. It totally misses the point of making the characters believable human beings. Snape was an a*hole, a shitty teacher and a bully - but also a hero. Dumbledore was manipulative and made mistakes - but in the end he meant well and saved not only Harrys live but with the sacrafice he lead Harry to every Person who fought in the battle of Hogwarts. Both sides of their personalities make them human.
