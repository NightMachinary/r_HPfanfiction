This presumes that Dumbledore was always like that. He could have started out god, got absolute power(in a sense) which slowly corrupted him. He fought against Voldy and won, in a sense. after "taking care" of harry by shipping him off he thought about ending the hold of the bigoted people but got nowhere due to political stuff. in the decade that harry was away he slowly became more cynical and hardhearted especially as the loss of so many he lead to their deaths in the war becomes clear. by the time harry comes back dumbledore had become the fanon version, not due to evil lolz, but due to a long process one which cannot really be captured properly especially as it is very easy and believable that the characters will interpret all actions made with canon intentions with fanon ones.
