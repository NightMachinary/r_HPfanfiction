I agree to some extent. Dumbledore isn't really about being an almighty ruler. He doesn't really care for that. However, I still really don't like him. While I do think a lot of dumbledore-bashing fanficts are just utterly ridiculous as they twist dumbledore's character around, that is because they don't quite understand dumbledore. Dumbledore I still dont like. I doubt I ever will. He was extremely biased, had some old fashioned prejudice nobody likes to talk about, twisted the rules in his favor for Harry even if it was entirely unfair to the rest of the Hogwarts student body, and really was just an extremely manipulative, and somewhat cruel old man. I don't think he would have killed Tom Riddle from the start. 1st. He didn't actually really begin to suspect Tom until after he was interviewed. Although he was wary of him during his school years. Furthermore, Tom, in some ways, was a lot like Harry. Neither had parents, neither had good adult role models, and neither really had anyone to help them but themselves and both were dirt poor. The difference is Tom was cold, calculating, and knew how to turn any situation to his advantage, while Harry didn't and often times tried to make the best out of a bleak environment. This is why Tom was in Slytherin, but Harry was not. 2nd. He would have gotten soooo much backlash. Tom had not done anythingf bad. Everyone loved him, everyone admired him. In the wizarding world that is. And Tom very quickly rose through the Slytherin ranks despite coming from a muggle background (though i am sure he saod he was abandoned there and the others suspected he was a bastard son or something). The point is, if Dumbledore would have done anything other than mildly inconvenienced Tom, he would have gotten a lot of crap about it. So anyone who has any degree of sense wouldn't try anything to him. Not to mention, he wouldn't be able to do anything whilst Tom was in school, as he would have likely lost is teaching position, and all credibility "greater good" or otherwise. Dumbledore is extremely cunning, very manipulative, and biased, but he would never do something that wouldn't help him. He helped harry because he needed harry, and maybe along the way he grew to care for him. But the fact remains that he helped harry because harry had some use. Because harry had to die eventually but the only way he could do so was for harry to idolize him. I doubt harry would have been willing to kill himself off should he hate dumbledore. He probably wouldnt bother listening to a thing Dumbledore said. Harry was not told until the very end and realizing that the only way to win the war was to die as the war was going on, which is why he willingly did so. Because it was the only option left. Because they had killed all but two horcruxes, one being him, and he knew ron and hermione would do whatever they could to stop the war even if he died. I think people make Dumbledore's character too shallow. He is awful, yes, and he has no buisness running a school, but he isn't awful in a way many would notice. He is careful. He is manipulative. It is the same with Severus. So while perhaps the fandom may make dumbledore too obviously evil, i think Dumbledore is the kind of person that is that subtle person in the background, pushing everything the way he wanted it to be and nobody being the wiser.
