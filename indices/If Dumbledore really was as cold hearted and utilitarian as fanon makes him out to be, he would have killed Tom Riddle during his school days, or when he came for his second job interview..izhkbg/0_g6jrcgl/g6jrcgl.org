If Dumbledore was actually utilitarian he would have killed Harry shortly after realizing he was a Horcrux. What most people seem to miss is that his manipulation was meant to give Harry a chance to survive. The only people that he feels comfortable sharing the Horcrux knowledge with are people that wouldn't kill Harry for the "Greater Good".
