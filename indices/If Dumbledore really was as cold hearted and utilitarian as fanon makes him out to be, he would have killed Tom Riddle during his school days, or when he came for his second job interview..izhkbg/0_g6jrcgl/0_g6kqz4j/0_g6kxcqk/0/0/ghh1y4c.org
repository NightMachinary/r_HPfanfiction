Harry does "literally everything" because hes the protagonist of a children's adventure book series. Imagine if rather than going after the stone; he just went to the teachers, and they actually listened like normal people would. Or in book 2, rather than fighting the basilisk with lockhart as his only backup; he just went to flitwick, and let him handle it.

Harry potter is full of irresponsible adults who seemingly want to put Harry in dangerous situations; this is because Harry is the hero, and as such must become embroiled in the dangerous plot of whatever book it currently is.

What alot of fanfiction writers forget to realise, is that much of the plot occurs due to the theme, if you change the theme you must then change the plot; otherwise keeping the original plot just makes various characters into caricatures.
