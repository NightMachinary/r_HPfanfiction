After what happened in book1? Between that, The Dursleys, and his "fame", he would be able to handle it.

And Dumbledore didn't suspect Horcruxes until the end of book2. And I'm probably mangling canon here, but didn't suspect scarcrux until year4.

With all the garbage that has happened to Harry until year4, Dumbledore should have understood that Harry wasn't going to have a childhood and that treating him like a mushroom (shoveled shit and kept in the dark) would only lead to getting smacked in the face a la the end of book5 where his plan blew up.

Even then, telling Harry EVERYTHING is a bad idea. Giving him a general outline and actually listening to him would have changed A LOT.
