Sharing with Harry would have been a horrible idea with his “saving people thing”. He would probably have run off to die so that his friends would have a chance to defeat Voldemort. Especially at the age they are. Kids at that age really don't think things through so if he thinks the only way is for him to die that will be all he can think about
