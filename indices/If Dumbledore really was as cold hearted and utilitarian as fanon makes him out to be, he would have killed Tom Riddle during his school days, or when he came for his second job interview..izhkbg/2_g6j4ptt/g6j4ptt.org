I think it's pretty well established he did not really know about Tom Riddle until after that job interview, which is when he really, really started to suspect him. That's why he refused to give him the position.

Before, he /suspected/ he had something with the Chamber, but it was only that, and he had no proof whatsoever.

IF he knew, I think it's safe to say he would've done something, heck if Dumbledore from the books time traveled back the first thing he would do would probably be killing Tom.
