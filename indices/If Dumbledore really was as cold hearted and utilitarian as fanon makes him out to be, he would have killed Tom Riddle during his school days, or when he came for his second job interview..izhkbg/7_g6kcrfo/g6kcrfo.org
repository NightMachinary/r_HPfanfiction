What really gets me about manipulative Dumbledore in bashing fics is that once Harry confronts Dumbledore about his plans, his plans just fall apart. He just talks about how it's for the greater good, don't you understand, but he doesn't try anything else. People who bash Dumbledore seem to often want him to be a manipulative puppetmaster but also want him to fold the moment anyone confronts him, it's weird.

Also when fanon Dumbledore uses the phrase for the greater good I think of this scene from Hot Fuzz (out of context spoilers: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5u8vd_YNbTw]] )
