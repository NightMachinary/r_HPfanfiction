I'd like to preface this by saying that I'm just playing Devil's Advocate for fun. Your observation's pretty accurate.

In those fics (and canon to an extent) Dumbledore doesn't actually force people to do anything. He just concocts situations where he sets them up to react a certain way, either by selectively giving them information or putting them in a position where one choice is clearly "correct."

If in the fic he doesn't really flex his power, magical or political, it would make some sense that once the manipulation is uncovered it would fall apart, if it hinges on the target being oblivious.
