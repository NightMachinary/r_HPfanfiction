Ever thought of the fact that Dumbledore's mentality is old school. No not his approach to the world, he is too cunning for that, but instead his moral view. I mean during his age of dark wizard, The dark wizard - Grindelwald - himself honoured or at least appreciated something that was good. During Harry's time, most people are just dishonourable bastards who are trying to gain favours and upstand each other. Even if Dumbledore realised this, it might just be that he was expecting people to do better unconsciously, expecting people to honour and do good.
