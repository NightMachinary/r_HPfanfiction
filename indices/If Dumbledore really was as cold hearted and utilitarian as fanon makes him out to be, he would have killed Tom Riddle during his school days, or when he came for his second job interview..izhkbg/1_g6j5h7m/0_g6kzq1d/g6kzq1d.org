I actually love the bit in FB2 where Dumbledore thinks he's manipulating Newt, but then Newt goes to France for the girl instead.

If we keep getting some things like that, it would be amazing to see how Dumbledore was at the periphery of everything, and keeps boosting his reputation and ego...while not actually being the influence he, and everybody else, thinks he is.
