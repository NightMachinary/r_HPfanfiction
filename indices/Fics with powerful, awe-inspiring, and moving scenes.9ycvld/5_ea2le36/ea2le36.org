The first fanfic I ever read -- recommended to me by a friend who knew I liked HP -- had a few scenes that still remain the most cinematic and incredible in my mind. (I also had no idea what 'slash' meant, so /that/ was a surprise.) I'll always nostalgically love /The Marriage Stone/ both for the battle in the north wherein Harry manages to seal the Dementors in the earth and especially the battle with the summoned demon on the Quidditch pitch (and the excellent treatment of Harry's condition afterwards).I don't think I'll ever really buy HP/SS in any form, though I do enjoy some of the stories because of interesting plot elements, but damn if I don't love those scenes.
