I love battle scenes in stories. It doesn't matter to me if it's a full blown battle between two armies or a fight one-on-one.

linkffn(Wind Shear by Chilord) There were few fights that are worth to mention.

linkffn(The One He Feared by Taure) Great World building. Best fight scene I've ever read in fanfiction.

linkffn(A Cadmean Victory by DarknessEnthroned) It's completed.

linkffn(More Than Equal by Ordinarily Prudent) In the beginning it's similar to 'A Cadmean Victory' but it divers later and i the story is lighter. Also the world building is better. I think.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Hidden Truth by KingFatMan25) It's completed. Also it's OC.

linkffn(What We're Fighting For by James Spookie)

linkffn(Defiance by Dark Lord Slytherin) I really liked fights here.

linkffn(Realignment by PuzzleSB)

I hope these will meet your criteria a bit.
