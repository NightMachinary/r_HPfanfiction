My husband knows I read it, and while he's generally not into fanfic, he does roleplay on a multiplayer online game with people and it's effectively the same thing - building a story with non-canon characters/characterizations in someone else's playground. So he doesn't poke at it or anything.

I'll occasionally share snippets of terribly written smut via Steam just to get him to crack up when he's taking something too seriously online.
