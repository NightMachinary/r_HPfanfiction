My gf knows and teases me mercilessly for it. "Don't even try to hide it, I saw Hermione's name" she'd say over my shoulder and I'd frantically try to hide the screen so she doesn't realise it's a weird rare pair.

She's only ever read one Katara/Zuko one, and that was it for her, but she's okay with it.
