My S.O. knows and is fine. She reads some of the stuff that I write and gives her feedback.

She's not much for reading it in general, but we have a mutual friend that is a fic writer and we both read their stuff even though their writing is...not great.

We're both bi so what we do read together runs the whole gamut of fanfiction. It's fun.
