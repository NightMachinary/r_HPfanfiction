My dude is cool with it, he jokes about how all fanfics are smutty fics when I complain about not finding more gen fics, or fics that go from adventure to Kama Sutra without warning. He hasn't finished the whole HP series, I've read the first 2 and a half books to him, and he's seen a few of the movies, generally he's just happy that I'm happy.
