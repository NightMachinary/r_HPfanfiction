Now I'm curious: did you breach to him the subject of controversial topics in fandom, like smut, slash, weird bad fic, etc.? Or did you just let him loose to find out his own information and decide his own limits? (which is what I was forced to do when I discovered fanfiction at 11 years old)

I always have this awkwardness about talking to my family about fanfiction. My parents think it's a lot of innocent, heterosexual, action-y fun stories, because I've just never fully explained the sheer /potential/ of fandom, and my mom thinks shipping only goes as far as what couple you want to end up together in canon.

(though my brother looks at me with a /look/ sometimes when I mention fanfic, and I think he knows at least some of it lol)
