My husband occasionally makes fun of me and tries to catch me reading something really weird, he isn't a HP fan anyway, but to be honest he doesn't care. That said, I wouldn't show him any of the smut I read 😂😂. All things considered, I doubt he would care anyway, and on the flip side he knows I absolutely do not give a shit if he is watching porn, so maybe we aren't the norm? 🤷🏻‍♀️
