Haha yup, sometimes he will just start making up some ridiculous stuff about ‘glistening centres' and ‘pulsing members' and I just have to laugh. One of his school friends writes fanfic and the things he writes are just terrible (think 15 3/4 inch penis) and so my husband just assumes that's what all smut is and also that all fanfic is smut. Sometimes he will mention something and so then I will search until I find the most ridiculous thing possible (once it was naive hermione giving Dumbledore a blowjob to suck the poison out of his hand so he can live) such as getting turned on by dubledore's beard tickling bellies (see above re hermione Dumbledore) and we both get a laugh out of it.
