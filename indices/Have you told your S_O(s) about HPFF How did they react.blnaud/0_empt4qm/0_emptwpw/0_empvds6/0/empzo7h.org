That's so cute. One of my previous girlfriends caught me reading linkffn(Yellow Submarine) and actually didn't even know it was fanfiction- she was blown away by how good the writing quality and remarked "I never thought something this good could be written for free by someone interested in Harry Potter."

But on the flip side now that I'm in my 20s an ex told me I was creepy/ a pedophile for being a guy who enjoys "perverted interpretations of a kid's novel." Not all HPFF is smut, but I guess it's what stands out. Oh well. Shouldn't let them believe a wild gander on AO3 is representative of all that's out there.

Thanks for the feedback. It's a big spectrum of work out there so I guess you have to start them off slowly. What would be some works you would start off showing to them if they were curious? I'm interested. Thanks. Have a great day!
