Oh goodness, I wouldn't even know what to rec my husband if I was to try and get him to read it- most of what I read ends up being slash!! The very first fic I read which I remember thinking I just had to share with somebody was Harry/Ginny linkffn(2479927) and to be honest I hardly even remember it now, it was probably four+ years ago that I read it, but I sought out one of my fellow Harry Potter loving friends (who I hadn't talked to in nearly 10 years!) and sent her the link. I think the best way to introduce somebody to the world of HPFF is to find something light, fluffy, complete and no more than 50k words though.

*/edit/* just for point of reference, I am nearly 29, married with two kids and obviously really enjoy it, I don't think there's anything to be ashamed of, so many of us grew up waiting for the next book to come out so we could read it, so to me there's nothing creepy about loving and wanting to still be in touch with such an integral piece of your life
