I remember there was one, but I'm not going to bother linking to it becayse honestly it was a pretty bad story. The entire thing was just an endless stream of "that was mean" -- "was that mean?" -- "yeah, that was mean." And pretty much all conflict and interest drained out of the story because anything that could even remotely be thought of as unfair or mean or anything but 100% supportive was weeded out from the story. Which meant there was no mystery, no suspense, no character and no interest.
