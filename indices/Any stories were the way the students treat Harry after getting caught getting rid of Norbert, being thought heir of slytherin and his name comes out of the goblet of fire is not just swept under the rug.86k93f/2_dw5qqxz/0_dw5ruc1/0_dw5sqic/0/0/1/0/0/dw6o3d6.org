So...by that statement we should all forgive Umbridge's torture because reading fics that give us revenge type plots on her mean we have problems? I wish I could roll my eyes far enough into the back of my head to give your statement the respect it deserves.

Listen the point of reading anything ever is to feel exactly what the writer wants you to feel. Feeling like wanting revenge on behalf of friends is normal in real life. When reading we often feel very close to the characters we read about. Hence the reason for wanting to read about the particular genere the OP was wanting to read.

OP, I think you would like Harry Potter and the Daft Morons. It has Harry instituting the change in fourth year but it's really well written.
