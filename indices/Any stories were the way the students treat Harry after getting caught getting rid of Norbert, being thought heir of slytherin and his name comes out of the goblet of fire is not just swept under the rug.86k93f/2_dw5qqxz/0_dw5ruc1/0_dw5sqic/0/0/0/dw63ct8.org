Except that if you go into someone's post that is a request just to tell them that they have problems, you likely have bigger ones.

OP is looking for a particular plot element, but did not specify why. Making assumptions about their reasons, likely wrong assumptions if you think about OP's words (“actually have to put effort into repairing [their] relationship with Harry”), and at the same time telling them off for those assumptions is just foul.
