Sort of but nothing really comes of it. I am looking for a stories were the student who notices actually gets other students to change.

Like the weasley twins finding out from Charile about Norbert and actually working out that that was why Harry was caught out of bed and Gryffindor lost 150 points and tell the rest of the quiddich team leading to them felling guilty and actually trying to be closer to Harry.

Or after second year the students find out that Harry nearly died down in the chamber of secrets Saveing another students life after the school had spent most of the year cussing him of being heir of Slytherin.
