Wow... the story is really well written. Just a few days ago I requested an fanfic about Tom Riddle. There are plenty but they either involve time travel or Riddle is portrayed as out of character (most depictions show him more like a prankster who almost falls in love at some point).

Your Tom Riddle, on the other hand, is very realistic. I think you are one of the few authors who actually managed to get him right as a cruel sadistic bully who has no respect for anybody, including his friends.
