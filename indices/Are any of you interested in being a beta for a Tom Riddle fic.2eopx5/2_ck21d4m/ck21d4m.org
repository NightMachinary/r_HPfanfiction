When I get the chance tonight, I'll go through it and then edit this post with my thoughts!

I love where you are going with this first chapter. It's lovely, but I feel like every time I get really intrigued by a snapshot, it ends all too suddenly and doesn't delve deep enough. The writing is great and I think, at least in the first chapter, you captured Tom's personality wonderfully. One spelling error in the 7th paragraph, starting with, "The laughter petered off..." Focused rather than focussed.

In the second chapter, your writing is great. It takes a lot of effort to stick with only displaying Eleanor's emotions rather than becoming omniscient and telling us exactly what Tom was thinking too - it adds to the story in a funny way for me. Because I already know Tom's character, it makes your writing credible.

In Chapter 3, the first paragraph was hard for me to get through. The flow of the writing was stalled due to strange wording, such as 'the sight or smell or sound', 'unused to', and 'the dark of the night'. It could just be my reading voice, but maybe look at a way to rephrase these sentences. I feel like you give readers the perfect amount of information in each of your snippets this chapter. Sure, I want more, but I no longer feel like I'm missing vital information or having to connect unspoken links. I want more now because the writing is excellent!

Chapter 4 was interesting to say the least! I loved how you added Dumbledore, the Chamber, and the attacks in this chapter. It's nostalgic and I'm excited to see how it plays out. Characterization for Dumbledore was spot on. In my head, I could see Tom being more passive aggressive during this chapter. Despite recognizing that he broke the rules, he is well aware that Dumbledore doesn't like him and his resentment for Dumbledore probably started very early. Dumbledore is the only person that can make Tom drop his facade.

Chapter 5 was written so much more... intensely than the previous smut. Did you take a break in writing? It isn't anything you should change, but the tone of this chapter was much more mature than the previous chapters. I love what you did with the creation of the Horcrux, but perhaps go into more detail about the agony Tom faced. The brief snapshot wasn't enough!

The ending - I loved the ending. Absolutely loved it! Your timeline was flawless and everything was done perfectly. I only have to ask, we were told continuously that Tom was wanting to use Eleanor for his own purposes, but those purposes were never revealed in detail. I'm assuming he used the affair as blackmail to get Lewis out of office, right? If so, maybe clear that up a little bit. In the end I had to re-read the last chapter to make sure that fit. With my first read-through, I was left feeling a bit dissatisfied thinking she was only included in the story for smut, however once I came to that realization, I was really pleased. It was a perfect way to tie in everything!

Recommendations: Perhaps make a snapshot of Tom getting Hagrid expelled or his plans to do so. You really used the Chamber of Secrets as a pivotal point in your writing. Perhaps add the ending of the Chamber in the story.
