If you still need someone to go through it then I will when I get a chance, probably later tonight as it's quite a short story.

Edit: Ah, who needs to do work at work... there was nothing glaringly obvious until chapter 4 and as near as I can tell this is he only issue:

  The moment hung there, unmoving. In his eyes she saw something dark move beneath the mirth. *He* words died on her lips.

From a more personal perspective I thought that it was for the most part very well written, it wasn't difficult at all to imagine canon Riddle acting in much the same way. Having the plot points we've heard about already further expanded upon was also very interesting. I certainly wouldn't be against reading a full account of Riddle's adventures through creating the horcruxes and building up forces - if you were to write it.
