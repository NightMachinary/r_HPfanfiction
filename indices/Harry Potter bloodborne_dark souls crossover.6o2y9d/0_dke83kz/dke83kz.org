Only thing I can find so far with decent writing quality. linkffn(12057347) Seems to be a one-shot though. I'm personally looking for something with a bit more substance. Either cracky as I suggested here [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6ni79j/im_looking_for_some_of_the_silliest_dumbest_or/dkalf9b/]] or something post-Hogwarts with a bit more seriousness attached. I'd love to see a well-written Hunter Harry that manages to capture the terrifying tone of Bloodborne.
