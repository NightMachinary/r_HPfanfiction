Harry Crow is a weird one for me. In my opinion it's objectively bad. Harry is OP as shit, the dialogue is awful, the characters all act way older than they are...it's just a mess in general. But, I do like some of its ideas. Specifically, making a casting system using things other than wands. Of course it's overpowered, but there's something fun about the thought of shooting spells out of a goddamn sword.
