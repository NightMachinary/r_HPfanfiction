Well, the goblin ARE a problem in this. I mean :

- Canon Goblin : sentiant magical creature, extremely greedy, revolt every 100 years or so, main reason wizards refuse to give them a wand (except the basic prejudice) is that it is pretty much assured that they would see it as a sign of weakness and revolt, and since revolts are often pretty close with the advantage of wands. . .\\
_Harr's crow Goblin : perfect race who control the economy and is so much better than the wizards (but don't win revolt, why ? ? ?). Only reason they revolt is because stupid wizards betray their promise and they have to for the honor of their race. So much wiser, and everything. No wand? It's ok we can create our own things that act like wands.
