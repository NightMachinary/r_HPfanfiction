I kind of like it as a guilty pleasure, but it does have major problems. For me, one of the biggest is an 11-year-old Harry being able to physically battle on a level with one of the goblins' best trainers of warriors. Another is that the goblins have such an incredibly simpler/better magic for transfiguration that nobody knew about until Harry demonstrated it in class.
