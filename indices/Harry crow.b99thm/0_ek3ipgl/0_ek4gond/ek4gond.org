I think it is a bad fic, with some of the most usual "sins" (Gary Sue hero, everything is perfect in the light side, we are 12 but let's pledge our eternal love nobody shall ever come between us, 11 years old veteran politician . . .), but some of its ideas, while silly, were pretty funny. Harry being so out of touch that he genuily believe fashion and maners didn't change since the 17th century, I would love to see it used in a more humorous way like crackfic.
