Agreed on all counts. The way I see it, fanfic works with a limited palette and serves largely as wish fulfillment and literary comfort food. It occasionally rises above those limitations, but for the most part it's inevitably cliched, limited, and self indulgent.

I can count on Robst to deliver a complete story, substantial but paced reasonable to a real conclusion, with some good ideas, humor, and true affection for the characters. Is it all those things AND a bit more cliched, self indulgent and prone to wish fulfillment than average? Sure. But the first part makes it worth it for me.

I read a lot of challenging literature. Fanfic isn't where I look for my challenges. YMMV.
