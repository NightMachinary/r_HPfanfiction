Harry Crow is cliched, trope-y, wish fulfillment. It's really more of a guilty pleasure sort of thing than anything that should be taken seriously imo.

Then again I'm of the opinion that fanfiction in general shouldn't be taken seriously. taking it seriously just sucks all the fun out of it for me.
