Why do you think its objectionable? I am asking seriously, because I feel that I don't fully understand where you're coming from.

I understand being uncomfortable with minors being used for purely smut writing, but surely authors can't just ignore that anyone underage has genitals, and that teenagers in particular might have a strong fascination with the genitals of themselves and their peers. It's a natural part of growing up, and by avoiding it the message we send is that teenager's sexuality is something they need to repress.

My prompt is, admittedly, just a crude dick joke, but it also felt to me like something that teenage boys would actually do.
