For me, gut feelings are something that your brain knows or believes in, yet you can't explain the reasoning behind it in words. It's based on your current knowledge. Harry in DH had a gut feeling that Voldemort had a Horcrux hidden in Godrics Hollow, because he knew Voldemort better that anyone, yet he couldn't put into words why he had this feeling. Turns out, his gut was "wrong", there was not a horcrux in GH (there were other things, but the point is that gut feelings aren't always right). Premonitions I always associated with visions, and visions imply a knowledge from the future, acquired from them.

The way I see it, this magic works in a way that it's always guiding you to "the right path" and taking you to places you need to be, without you knowing WHY it works that way (sorta like a gut feeling, but it can never be wrong, and can't be ignored, otherwise it gets stronger). The same with people, you're thrown back in time with the same emotions your future self have, and you can't explain why you have such strong feelings for that person even if you don't know them or all the evidence you have should make you hate them, yet you have deep affection for that person
