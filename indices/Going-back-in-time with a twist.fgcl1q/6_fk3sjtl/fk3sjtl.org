I recall reading a Snily with this premise. The fic was dubious IMO, and also seems to be gone from ffn entirely (I can probably dig it up if someone wants to) nowdays. Basically, he goes back, but forgets his future memories, but not his future emotions and decides to follow what his gut feelings tell him (something very un-Snapeish IMO, and this was far from the fic's only issue). I think linkffn(Dreams of Future Past) pulled it off much better -- canon Snape sends memories to a younger Severus in a parallell universe, who makes different choices as a result.

If SS-centric (or LESS specifically) isn't your thing, there's a fic that doesn't really use your premise, but has a similar execution: linkffn(Ruthless by AngelaStarCat)

Instead of Lily's love protection, James casts a spell on Harry that essentially functions as a much darker, but permanent, Felix Felicis -- Harry's entire life is guided by "good" choices to ensure survival.
