That's basically linkffn(12560378), but the part of non-completely remembered future is poorly written so for a long time the main hero looks like a complete jerk who lets Sirius knowingly rot in Azkaban and let her best friend (Ginny) be slowly mind-raped by the super evil wizard. Only later it is properly explained.
