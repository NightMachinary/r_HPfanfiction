I love these kinds of fics:

1.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1136716/chapters/2298467][Hello Journal]]:

#+begin_quote
  Hello journal. Today we have a prompt. Our prompt is our favrit family tradition. I do not have a favrit family tradition because I do not have a family. Signed, Harry Potter.

  Harry Potter's third form journal. A peek at pre-Hogwarts life.
#+end_quote

This fic is written in the form of Harry's journal entries, with a sort-of Outsider POV in the form of Harry's teacher, who reads these entries and provides feedback and things. Harry's entries are really realistic as he actually sounds/writes like an 8 year old boy. Most of the fic is just Harry's responses to the prompts given to him, but there are a few chapters that are written specifically in the POV of the teacher. One chapter even deals with the whole Harry-teleporting-onto-the-roof fiasco.

The fic is still a WIP, but ends at a note that feels complete.
