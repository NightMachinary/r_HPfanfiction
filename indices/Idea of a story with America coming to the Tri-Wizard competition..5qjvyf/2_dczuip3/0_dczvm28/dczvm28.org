The buzzing vehicles drove around the courtyard and between panicked clutches of students. A tall man in a uniform exited from a hatch in the top of float and blew a shrill whistle. From what seemed a random and chaotic swarming of toy cars, the cadets drove back to the float, aligning themselves in a ruler-straight row a few yards in front of it. They still had their engines grumbling, as if ready to drive off again at a moment's notice.

A second pattern from the shrill whistle prompted them to turn the engines off.

Dumbledore approached the array of vehicles, meeting the tall uniformed man as he stepped down onto the ground.

"Sergeant-Major Krang, I presume?"

"That'd be me, Headmaster Dumbledore."

"You know, we were expecting you a week ago."

"Ah, well, we originally deployed from our stealth craft at the harbor in Inverness, but then we ended up driving all over hill and dale looking for this place. You know, it ain't on any of our maps? Damned inconvenient. I think the boys might actually be a bit deaf from the march playing after so long. Won't complain about it, though, nosiree."

"You were playing the music all the way here?"

"No sir- only during daylight. We're not idgits."
