Illvermorny champion sounded more realistic than this (and I still don't know how an entire school can be a Gary-Sue). Frankly, I believe that Illvermorny is largely similar to Hogwarts in many aspects since it was founded by a brit. It's likely that the castle is just bigger, and they maybe have a dedicated Duelling/Dark Arts Class, simply because it's the American way to 'practice what should be prohibited'.

I would rather see a story where Harry takes up Duelling and meets Illvermorny, Mahoutokoro, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang students in combat.
