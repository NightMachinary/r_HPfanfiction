I like the idea of Americans intervening against Voldemort, using a ritual that was specifically designed to kill individuals with horcruxes. They got rid of Voldemort quickly, but messed up the occupation afterwards, and now multiple factions were fighting an endless civil war in magical Britain.

A decade after Voldemort's fall, the civil war in Britain had spread to continental Europe, with Germany, Balkans, and Spain all in chaos. More distant magical foreign powers were further drawn into the conflict, such as Russia, Ottoman Empire, Abbasid Caliphate, Greater Persia, East African Confederation, and United China.
