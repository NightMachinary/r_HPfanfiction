Thanks for the ideas. One of the plots in my thinking is since the government is taking interest in developing situation of "dark" activity that the government might be more accepting of using modern equipment as a early intimidation tactic. The school just being a benefactor of a situation. While they truly just stuck in the middle.

I have this idea of trying to write from the school side but, while also showing government involved more then normally would....or maybe I am just sitting here trying to justify my original ideas.

Thinking of B-52 plane flying over Hogwarts and having everyone paratroop out. Does this seem little over the top? First thought was have them storm out of the plane with brooms.

I liked the idea of land arrival since Durmstrang showed up in a boat in the lake, and Beauxbatons showed up from the air with the carriage.
