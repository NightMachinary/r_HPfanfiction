Military high schools in the US don't have access to military-only vehicles - and while I realize magic could replace that, it's not really in-theme. If you're going for something truly American Military Prep School, I think you'd do better with either a WWII-era plane, or a Revolutionary War era or Civil War era ship. Those are very much considered "patriotic symbols"
