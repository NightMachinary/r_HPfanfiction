  One scene I have in my mind is having the school show up crashing through the Hogwarts front gates with a MRAP vehicle with Red, White, and Blue smoke bellowing behind it.

MRAP was only introduced during the Iraq War (2003-?), it didn't exist in 1994 when that TWT was held.

With respect to magical US, we really don't know anything about modern day MACUSA. They might have made a 180 degree turn during WW2 on their strict segregation from Muggles, just like their Muggle counterpart who made a 180 degree turn on isolationism.

Seeing Grindelwald going all in with Hitler, American wizards might have gone all out to help Allied forces. From then on, they could become an important part of the US government and later play important roles during the Cold War, for example safeguarding US nuclear weapons from Soviet wizards.

So your story would have merit, but please don't involve Muggle technologies that didn't exist back in mid 1990s.
