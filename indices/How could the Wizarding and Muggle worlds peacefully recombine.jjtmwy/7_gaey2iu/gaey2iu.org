I've thought about this and similar scenarios myself for some time, and I agree with those who say it would be impossible to accomplish in a way that could preserve both the culture and structure of the wizarding world and ensure a bloodless transition. HOWEVER! That does not mean it is wholly impossible if one is willing to let go of those two caveats.

In the example scenario given (an alternate earth with the complication of wartime magical purging forcing exposure on magicals), there are two conditions that would influence how the magical world might attempt to continue, if not simply survive:

1. Prior to the exposure of magic the muggle leaders of almost all of the Allies were aware of the magical societies within their respective nations, if not in regular contact with them. These leaders would have to have known about the Statute of Secrecy and how their respective governments worked in order to cooperate with them, so it stands to reason that in the larger and/or more forward-thinking nations they would have drafted emergency plans and procedures to be enacted in the event of a catastrophe or collapse of the Statute. Smaller, weaker or more isolated countries may not have similar plans, but the magicals in them might. In some cases, depending on the magical society, it might seem safer or easier to the magicals to simply take over or establish economic ties with larger allies to protect themselves.

2. The exposure occurred during and after WW2. This is a period of extreme upheaval in the balance of world powers that has not fully stabilized to this day, and a volatile time economically and politically speaking. It's easy to think that the world took time during the aftermath and the Cold War to recover, but the reality is that while the muggle world was indeed recovering quickly, tensions between the remaining powers were as high as they were because EVERYBODY was extremely vulnerable after the war. New technology had invalidated the old way of thinking about war and defense, the loss of life had crippled workforces and industries all over the world, and infrastructure had to be rebuilt from the ground up across the majority of Europe. No matter how damaging adding the variable of magic to that equation could be, it would be the perfect environment to nurture something like a magical renaissance. The powers of the world would be tripping over each other in a mad scramble to secure as many magical resources and alliances as fast as humanly possible, from both sides of the conflict. Remember the Nazi scientist buy-up after WW2? Imagine a space race that took weeks instead of years and a properly funded modern day NASA.
