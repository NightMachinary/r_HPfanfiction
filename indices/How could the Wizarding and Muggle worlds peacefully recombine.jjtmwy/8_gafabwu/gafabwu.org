Industrialisation of potions.

Introduce them slowly with the proper human trials, and get them accepted. Once they've been accepted for medical reasons introduce more variety of short term potions, such as veritasium, canary creams, and hair restorers.

Once it's part of society introduce wand users and enchanted items.

It will be very hard to keep wizarding culture unless they want to go the way of the amish.
