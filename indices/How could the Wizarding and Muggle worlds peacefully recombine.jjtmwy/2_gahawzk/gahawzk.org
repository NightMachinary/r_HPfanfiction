*In Short term* I cannot think of a peaceful transition. Think of protests, violence, rioting and looting that has occurred over last few years. Many of these over petty and frankly stupid issues (having to wear a mask?).

If Magic were to become known - I truly fear the outcome. We would have riots and witch hunts on a global scale, far worse than anything we've ever seen. A wave of violence which will be driven by extreme religious spiel. After all - Magic would undermine all of religion, every prophet, every miracle, every saint, not to mention psychological devastation it would cause for billions of people... One person is smart, can reason and understand, but a group of people? Wild panicky animals!

While some suggest that Magicals could mollify us the Muggles by magical potions and gadgets, solving our global issues - this would be temporary at best. I think witches and wizards would resent very much having to solve all our problems.

*In medium term* after protests and violence have subsided, and brought under some control, it all depends on power in-balance between Muggles and Magicals. Magic users could be caged up in concentration camps, or maybe active state of war declared between the two, or Magicals may have Imperius the shit out of every world leader, or there could be an uneasy truce between them.

*Long Term* however I believe to be very positive outcome for mankind. Think of technological / magical advances, flying cars, interstellar starships, force fields, faster than light travel. Perhaps through gene therapy everyone will have magic... Or perhaps Magicals will be like the Jedi in Star Wars universe. Who knows, but I think there is massively positive potential for humanity as a whole.
