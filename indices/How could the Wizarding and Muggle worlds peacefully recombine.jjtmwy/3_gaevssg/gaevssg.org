Wizards and Witches would become like the Air Nomads in LOK and/or Alchemists in Fullmetal Alchemists.

Magic would be very strictly regulated, and laws like the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery would be a lot tighter and far more strictly enforced. Not for secrecy, but for the safety of both Muggles and Magicals alike.

There would be societal expectations for magic-kind to use magic for the benefit of mankind (on the positive end of the spectrum) and it is likely that wizards and witches would be discovered at a younger age and separated from the Muggle populace at younger ages than eleven.

As for the actual integration? I recommend coming out of the shadows with solutions to global, Muggle problems (such as famine, homelessness etc.) Something that avoids conflict and politics and firmly cements magic kind as peaceful and helpful.

This would, unfortunately, set the expectation for wizards and witches as a species (and wouldn't remotely ensure zero backlash at their reveal) but it does set up interesting conflicts to discuss in a world Post-Statute of Secrecy
