In my scenario, the Axis win the Second World War. This is a world where Grindelwald never existed, and German Wizards allied with the NSDAP to oppose communism.

The Wizards help Germany win over the allies, and they also destroy the ICW for allying with the Communists during the war.

America survives the war, though it loses Hawaii to Japan.

Its all based off of a visual novel I've been reading.

I could see the American wizards being all like, 'Hey, you know how Germany was able to win over you all? Well, its because of people like us. But Germany also destroyed our global culture that had existed since time immemorial. We want revenge. We will help you take on the Reich.'
