Integration of two seperate yet developed society in this case will be hard. One society has the technology and numbers while the other literally has magic. If wizards suddenly start appearing, muggles will have hard time adapting to this. We fear what we don't understand and it's not possible for wizards to reach each and every single person and alleviate their doubts. Then of course there will be some muggle leaders who will turn this fear to hate.

If it started earlier when wizarding society hadn't developed then it would have been easier to integrate. But now, wizards will be alienated as there is difference in the society rules. That's not even talking about other magical creatures.

Avada is a different story but tell me how will you react when you find out that every wizard and witch is capable of using IMPERIUS, cruciatus, and have access to poly juice potion... Some even invisibility cloak. Worst of all, the legilimens against which muggle have no protection at all.
