That-Bastard-Who-Just-Won't-Die is one of my favourites if Harry is being particularly self deprecating. Or just The-Man-Who-Didn't-Die.

The Protector

The Saviour (of the wizarding world)

Fate's Bitch

The last one is a joke between friends mostly.

I'm suffering from sleep deprivation so I can't think of more, but if I have a sudden burst of creativity I will leave whatever my mind comes up here.
