I've got a Wip where Harry is favoured by Hagrid in the first few scenes and his twin is annoyed by it, going so far as agreeing with Draco in Madam Malkins. But they talk it out before Eyelops and Hagrid apologises by giving Hedwig to the twin (Harry is a messy kid and wouldn't get along with her in this AU).

Most of the heart of the story is about the twin still choosing to protect Harry since he is the relation to Lily that keeps Harry safe.
