Yeah I've always wondered how the wbwl thing became such a rigid and defined trope because the idea of the potters actually abandoning a child is so ridiculous.

I'm writing one where they're twins but because of their upbringing at the Dursleys they're super tight because it's basically them against the world. it's the only way I see that going unless there have been mitigating circumstances. Like perhaps Petunia would engage in some divide and conquer head games, but I think twins or any siblings would be more likely to bind together as kids in the face of shitty abusive behaviour
