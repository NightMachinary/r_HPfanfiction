I can see Harry twin getting a teeny tiny bit jealous. But that is mostly due to them wanting to have and identity. Outside of being the "Boy who lived" twin. But Loving Harry fair more than they could ever be jealous of him.

Or maybe Harry's twins a squib. And they're just jealous that he can get away from the Dursley. But also loving him a lot.

I honestly haven't read a lot of fic's were Harry has a twin so I don't know.
