If you can combine the FF.net search with the content amount of FF.net and AO3 I would use it. The biggest sticking point will get be getting authors to use your site. You could post their stories without their permissions and just give them no author tag but that would generate a ton of legal issues.

What I said above is all I really want for features but being able to copy and paste would be nice. Night reading mode that inverts colors would be great.

I dislike the idea of subscription for features. I understand you need money to operate a site but I can't think of any features you could paywall without subtracting from the quality of the site.
