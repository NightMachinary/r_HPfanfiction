1. Yes. You would probably have better luck trying to create a site for FF generally, rather than a site that focuses on HP FF.

2. I would want to be able to list categories/characters like on FF.net. AO3 seartchng is difficult because everyone tags their fics with as many characters as possible. That needs to be limited as it is on FF. The other thing I wish FF.net would do would be the implementation of a "Similar fics" type feature. Basically if you like a fic, it will suggest fics for you based on other people's preferences and perhaps the story info (like the main characters).

3. Make it first, and then figure out how to monetize. You can try to set up a subscription-based model, but I think FF is something of a guilty pleasure for some people and a lot of readers might be underage.
