1) Yes.

2) Quite a few, actually. I only use FF.net and Portkey to read fanfics, but some things I would really like are:

- Lack of decent search/filter system. Sure, you can filter by wordcount and character etc, but that isn't going to stop me from having to sort through 930 badly written slash fics where Harry and Draco do the deed every other chapter.

- Heavily customisable reading experience. As mentioned by others, having customisation over fonts, text sizes, background colours (bright white is not good for reading at night) text colour etc.

- Downloadable fanfic files. .epub/.mobi or whatever you can work into it. I read so much on my phone it's ridiculous, and opening 20+ chapters on Chrome on my phone is tedious and boring. Plus, it allows for reading when your internet goes down/you're without it.

- Categories. So many different fanfics can slot into categories neatly and it's ridiculous that we don't use them. Of course, a fanfic wouldn't be a part of one category specifically, but take for example 'A Black Comedy' (assuming you've read that.) It technically classes as an AU, but Humour and Action etc. also. If you could file it in all of those categories, it would work just as effectively as a tag system for trying to find it.

- More in-depth story status options. FF.net has 'Complete' and 'In-progress'. I'm thinking it would be infinitely more useful if a range of tags was available. For example, if you are putting your story on Hiatus you can set it as 'Hiatus'. If you haven't updated for a certain period of time (1-2 years, maybe?) then it is automatically tagged with 'Abandoned'.

- Recommendations! Go take a look at myanimelist.net. Under each anime there is a section called 'recommendations' where a user can post what they think is a story that readers of the current story would enjoy, and then other users vote up or vote down those recommendations based on how true that is.

- A better rating system. It could be something as simple as 'rate 1-10' with the average being displayed. Would make searching for stories others think are great much easier.

- 'Safeguard' mode. A setting in your profile (assuming you'll implement those) that will change whether or not you will see NC-17/explicit stories. A better alternative to just banning it outright, as there are people that like it.

- 'Story of the week'? It could be an upcoming story that has received a lot of reads/votes/whatever recently. Would help with the production of new quality stories, as that's been quite lackluster recently.

3) Yup. I'd pay for a site like this, easily.
