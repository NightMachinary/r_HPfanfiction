  Categories. So many different fanfics can slot into categories neatly and it's ridiculous that we don't use them. Of course, a fanfic wouldn't be a part of one category specifically, but take for example 'A Black Comedy' (assuming you've read that.) It technically classes as an AU, but Humour and Action etc. also. If you could file it in all of those categories, it would work just as effectively as a tag system for trying to find it.

Careful with that one, don't want to end up like hpfanfictionarchive, where you do a search for a particular catgeory/character/pairing, and get tons of results where authors just flagged everything to increase search results. Unfortunately the only way to curtail that is either by having a massive moderator team that can force authors to use the right tags, or much better, only allow 1/2/3 options per selection.
