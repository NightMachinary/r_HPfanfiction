So I'm a web developer too! (Yay!) And I wrote a blog post about this - I've really been thinking about this myself. Anyways, I'm currently moving houses / been busy, but this is the next project I'm going to work on. I'd love to work with you - or if you prefer to work by yourself, feel free to steal these ideas. Seriously, a better fanfiction website would help all of us out.
