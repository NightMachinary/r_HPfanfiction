I had a read of your points and there's some interesting things in there. I like the idea of more encouragement for beta readers, perhaps support for that could be included on the site such as adding Beta: <name> to the credits.

Author donations is a tricky subject, since much of the subject matter is covered by copyright laws. I suspect that might end up crossing the line into lawsuit territory.

I agree with you on author's notes. I'm not against them, but I do think they should be out of the "flow" of the story. Maybe have a section at the start/end of the chapter for author notes that people can have collapsed or expanded as per their preference. The notes will be there to read if you want, or hidden if you don't.
