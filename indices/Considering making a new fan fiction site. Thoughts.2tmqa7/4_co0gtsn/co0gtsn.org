1) Not unless there was a huge following on it. If there's not many stories being uploaded onto it or not many people reading stories (I write too) I wouldn't see it as worth my time. I have stories posted to both A03 and FFnet but I always forget to update the A03 one as I don't have the same readership as I do on ffnet (less people reading it, less people reviewing).

2) I like the idea someone mentioned about having a bookshelf for stories. If I may add, have a bookmark option for individual stories as well. Sometimes when I leave a story I forget what chapter I was on (if the chapters are unnamed) and it takes some time to find my spot again.

I think a "no" search parameter needs to be added. So "no-character" or "no-pairing" or "no-keyword".

3) I wouldn't pay for a gold membership if that's what you're asking. I'm not sure what extra/unique features you could provide that would make it worth it (I've been reading/writing fan fiction for nearly ten years, so I'm pretty content with the free services that already exist).
