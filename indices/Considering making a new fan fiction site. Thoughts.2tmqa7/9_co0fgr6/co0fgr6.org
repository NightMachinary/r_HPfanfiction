The only thing I currently miss at FFN is a way to sort searches by /favourites/last 30 days/ or something like that.

I can sort by favourites today, but the top of the list will have mostly old fics. I want to find the fast-rising new fics.

I've been thinking about writing a web scraping script to let me search off-line just to find those hidden gems.
