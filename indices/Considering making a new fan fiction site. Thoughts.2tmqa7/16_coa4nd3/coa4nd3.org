Search ability is important. This also means certain restrictions that MUST be placed on authors.

1. Allow stories to be flagged as slash/nonslash, and for users to then search specifically for one or the other or both. Cause nothing's more annoying then 20 pages of results of slash.

2. This is important, DO NOT allow authors to list "Characters: [List of every character in the story]" (I'm looking at you hpfanficarchive). Same goes with categories, pairings, genres, etc. FFnet has the right idea, constrain authors to pick the 1 or 2 items per selection that best fit, cause nobody wants to search for harry/luna and get a result of fics where luna is listed as a pairing along with every other girl just to get in on search results.
