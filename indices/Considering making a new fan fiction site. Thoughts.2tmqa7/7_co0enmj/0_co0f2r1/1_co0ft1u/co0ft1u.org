I'd suggest just getting the word out (once it's up and ready) and asking some of the 'big' writers if they'd like to post their story on the website too. If it really is better than FF.net, you'll eventually begin attracting people on word of mouth alone.

One thing that you should aim for is getting people to write exclusively on this website. If a story can only be found there, and the story is good, more people are likely to read it.
