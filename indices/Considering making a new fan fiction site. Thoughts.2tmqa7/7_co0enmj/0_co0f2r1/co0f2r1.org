Customisable fonts was certainly on the menu, I very much like the idea of having the site be very customisable with regards to reading experience as everyone likes things different.

With regards to ads, they're unfortunately a necessary evil when it comes to making a site and no ads would certainly be a benefit of "gold" membership.

Any suggestions as to how I might attract writers? I'd considered contacting some of the higher rated authors and inviting them on to the site to cross-post their current stories to get the ball rolling.
