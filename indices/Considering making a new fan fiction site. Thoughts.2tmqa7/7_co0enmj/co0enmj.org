1) Yes.

2) A proper reading mode on the site, with customizable fonts, font sizes, spacing on sides, font and background colours... OR an automated conversion to .epub files to download. A companion Android/iOS app would also be awesome and would elevate the site to something much more than fanfiction.net.

Also, a method of putting stories in some kind of a "read later bookshelf", you know, when you find a story but you're in the middle of another one, so you don't forget about it.

3) Yes, I would consider it. Would not think long if it also meant no ads on the site and the companion app.

BUT, a site can be absolutely awesome, I will not use it if the stories and writers are not there. You have to focus on getting the writers there.
