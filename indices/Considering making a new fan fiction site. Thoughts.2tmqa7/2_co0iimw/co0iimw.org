I think there already are way too many fanfic-hosting websites. You'd either have to make something exceptionally good to draw the already accustomed users to your new project or you'd only increase the number of overall websites.

My suggestion would be to try focusing on a servicing application instead. This could be a browser script, similar to reddit enhancement suite, a set of browser expansions or a set of smartphone apps. This way you'd manage to make /all/ the already existing websites “yours”, in a way. By going one step further, you could even provide your own backend-only server for archiving and data mining purposes.
