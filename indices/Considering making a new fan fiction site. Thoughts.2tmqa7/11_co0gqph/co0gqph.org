I think you will have a very hard time making it popular with giants like FFN and AO3 around, but you can never know I guess.

I'd say, go for responsive design which would make for easy reading on both mobile devices and desktops. Put the story first and simplify the interface as much as possible. I like FFN overall, but it's a bit busy and complex, at least on the author side. And AO3 just gives you this monster of a page when you post a story. An intuitive and simple interface should help attract readers and writers.

You could also try to create some unique features to set your site apart from the others. For example, there's this site anonkun.com which has a very interesting system for interactive stories and live feedback. I'm not saying copy it, it's just that it's something I've never seen on other writing sites. If you have something that's not offered by FFN or AO3, it might make people flock there as well.
