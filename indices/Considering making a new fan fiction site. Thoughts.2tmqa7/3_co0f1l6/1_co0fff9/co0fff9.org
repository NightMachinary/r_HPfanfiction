Yeah, search is very very important for a site such as this. Straight up text search is probably slightly less useful than having a wide variety of ways to filter the visible stories as desired.

I've been thinking about the idea of explicit content. I'm all for allowing it, although I think above a certain raiting level it may have to be behind age confirmation (Registered users who have confirmed their date of birth only) with no explicit content in titles or descriptions at all.
