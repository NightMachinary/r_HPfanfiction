I would use it, but only if it had a decent search system and allowed explicit content. For example, FFN.net is great, but no mature content. AO3 has the worst search system known to man, but otherwise is good. Also, as a search parameter, make a no-slash one.

That is one of the most annoying things about archive. If you want explicit M/F, then it's almost impossible to find due to all the Harry/Draco stories.
