Yep. I think I remember one fanfiction that suggested that NEWT-level History of Magic was actually "present-day" history and might cover the Ministry's current organization, prominent members, etc., and how it came to be organized in that way. Hardly any students cared enough about History of Magic to continue into NEWT studies except the Slytherins who knew what it was for.
