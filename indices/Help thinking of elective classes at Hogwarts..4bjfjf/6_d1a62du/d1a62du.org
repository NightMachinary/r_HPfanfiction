Let's see - [[/u/mergirl007][u/mergirl007]] does mention that Hogwarts doesn't have an English teacher, but I could see there be someone offering seminars on how to improve writing, whether it's first or seventh years. There could also be a languages teacher, maybe a class or two focused on the arts, like theatre, music, etc, especially when you consider magical portraits. There could also be an advisor that works specifically with seventh years interested in playing professional quidditch. A lot of shop and home ec would be covered by the stuff listed below. While this is a world of magic, I think it's interesting to see things that we might have taken as high school electives with a slight spin to them because of magic.
