I wouldn't recommend this, it seems very American and Hogwarts, of course, is British. In British schools, it's broken up into Design & Technology (which includes Cookery, Textiles, Resistant Materials, Electronics, and Graphics) and Personal Social Heath Education (which covers Puberty, Alcohol, Drugs, Finance, Tax, etcetera). That, however, seems very modern and not very Hogwartsy, so I'd recommend coming up with a new name for it.
