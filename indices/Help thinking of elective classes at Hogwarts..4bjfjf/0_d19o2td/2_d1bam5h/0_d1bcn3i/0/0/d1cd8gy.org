Both the Cloak and the Wand are not unique, there are other invisibility cloaks (and the disillusionment spell) and other wands. I don't see any reason there couldn't be lesser versions of the Resurrection Stone in spell form.

EDIT: And linkffn(Potter vs Paradox) has just reminded me that shades of dead people were summoned by the /Prior Incantatem/ effect at the end of GoF. So canon-possible under specific circumstances.
