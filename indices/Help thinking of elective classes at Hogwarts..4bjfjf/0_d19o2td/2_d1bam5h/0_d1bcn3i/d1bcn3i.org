Sure. Actually the "Obscure Arts" was my own category for things I didn't think would reasonably be taught at Hogwarts so there you go.

On the other hand, a "good" necromancy class could include such things as:

- detection of necromantic activity (to find the bad guys)
- ghost counseling (to help them pass on? or just help them deal with their new situation?)
- ghost exclusion (to keep them out of an area)
- ghost banishment ('cause sometimes enough is enough)
- communication with the dead (for murder trials, will/estate questions, ancestral wisdom, etc.)
- spells to lay inferi to rest peacefully
- spells to prevent corpses from being made into inferi in the first place (you'd think this would be standard for all magical funerals?)

I'm sure there could be many other "good" applications.
