I'll also point out that Divination gets pretty short thrift in most fanfictions. But "divination" doesn't just mean predicting the future, it's really the magic of acquiring knowledge/information ("... seeking knowledge of the future /or the unknown/ ..." my computer dictionary says, emphasis added) -- which, when you think about it, is /huge/.

linkffn(0800-Rent-A-Hero) is taking a stab at doing Divination properly, but there's still a lot to explore in that area I think.
