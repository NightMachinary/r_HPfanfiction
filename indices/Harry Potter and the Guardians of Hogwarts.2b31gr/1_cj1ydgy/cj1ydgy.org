I would still go with " for dialogue quotations. The reading is better with the double quotes. Pains me to say it, but some grammar work is needed. Punctuation is on the top of the list in regards to dialogue. To echo what Makinporing said, you need to come out of that first chapter with an objective. Starting in media res is confusing enough. Ending it without a definitive concluding thought makes for a jumbled read.
