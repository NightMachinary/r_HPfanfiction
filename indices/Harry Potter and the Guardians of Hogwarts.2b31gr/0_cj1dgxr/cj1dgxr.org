Here's some advice, if that's what you're asking for:

- Use " instead of ' for dialogue.
- Learn when to use punctuation.
- I have no idea what the fic is going to offer(in general terms) from the first chapter, and the reader should know if you want people to read it. Ending in a cliffhanger is not enough, and the first chapter amounts to "Voldemort keeps sending Harry dreams after OotP and Ron falls off a broom after something weird happens", which doesn't sounds too promising. Your summary doesn't help much either.
