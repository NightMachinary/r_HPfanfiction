I've wondered about this too. I've always assumed they came at the end of July and it was a coincidence that it was Harry's birthday, and that authors who said otherwise just hadn't thought about it enough to realise their error.

It could still be that they get their first letter on their 11th birthday though, since it's completely nonsensical, which fits perfectly with both the wizarding world and JKR's propensity for whimsy over realism.
