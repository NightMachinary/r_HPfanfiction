J K has said that it's cannon that a magical quill writes names in a book when a magical child is born. I've always assumed that it included their birthdays too, and when the time comes a second magical quill writes the letters and sends them out. It would be triggered to do so in June, once book knows that the student will be eleven years old by the time the Hogwarts Express departs that year. Because it has to write letters for every student, because the upper years need their supply lists and OWL and NEWT results, it takes it about a month of constant day and night writing. The school owls fly in and pick up the letters and deliver them once they are finished.
