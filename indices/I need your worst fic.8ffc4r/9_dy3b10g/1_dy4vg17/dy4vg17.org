bruh, while the plot was kinda whack, the writing itself was much much better than the standard for fanfiction. like, it's actually readable without your neck instantly snapping to remove you from the mortal coil, unlike probably about 92% of fanfiction i've read...

seriously, don't sell yourself too short man
