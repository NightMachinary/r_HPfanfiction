i've read both several times, so far i prefer kaleidoscope due to it being complete, though when Fractal gets some more updates my opinion might shift. also, really OP harrys (when done at least semi-reasonably well) are a bit of a guilty pleasure for me :V

side note and blatant self-advertisement: if you or anyone else want to discuss fanfiction, writing or anything else, i have a pretty chill discord server ( [[https://discord.gg/eJfSD93]] )
