Draco never pretended to be her friend and he wasn't her housemate. Draco was taught his entire life to hate everything she was, you can't blame a child for that. Draco also cares about his mother, not just himself. He definitely needs redeeming by the fanfic author (just like Snape does), but it's possible without completely ignoring how the character was in the books. That, and dark pasts make for good romance.

Ron is weak-willed (look at book four where he can't throw of the suggestion of the imperius even after he's released from the spell), a bully, self-centered, lazy, and an idiot. I can think of no redeeming qualities for Ron as a character. I hate that his patronus is a dog because I can't think of a less loyal character than him.
