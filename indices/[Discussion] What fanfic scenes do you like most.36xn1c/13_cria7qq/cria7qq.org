People freaking out over Hermione dating Draco/Snape, followed by her putting them in their place. It gets even better when it's an actual major story line, finding a way to be together despite everyone else's objections.

I absolutely hated DH (and wasn't a big fan of HBP), so I appreciate any story that disregards those or at least heavily changes them, particularly Hermione being attracted to Ron (Because the brightest witch in her year would be attracted to the whiny self-centered idiot who dismisses almost everything she does all the time, and actually think it could work as a relationship), Harry being a Horcrux (seriously, Quirrel couldn't even touch him, how would a piece of Voldemort's soul survive on Harry with the blood protection still intact?) and the concept of a 'taboo' (If that is possible, why didn't the ministry use it in regards to unforgivables?).
