My favorite scene is from my favorite fanfic, [[http://www.hpfandom.net/eff/viewstory.php?sid=6256][Secrets by Vorabiza]], it's the scene where Harry finally reveals to everyone (the Weasleys, Hermione, etc) what exactly he has been doing the entire summer.

It's just so fucking funny. I love the twins and Ginny, I love the behavior from the Malfoys and Snape, it's just lovely. I seriously love that fic waaaay too much. I keep re-reading it.

I think I just love it when Harry is actually portrayed as smart/strategic/willing to give even his most hated enemy (aside from Voldy) a chance. Plus, you know, Drarry.
