I *LOVE* me a good Reveal, of whatever plot point there has been left hanging or mysterious. For example, [[/spoiler][in Alexandra Quick and the Stars Above, when Livia's presence forces Claudia to reveal her real relationship to Alex]], or [[/spoiler][in Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool, when Jamie/Harry finally reveals to Lily and James his/her true origin, even though we knew it all along]]. The suspense just gets me every time.
