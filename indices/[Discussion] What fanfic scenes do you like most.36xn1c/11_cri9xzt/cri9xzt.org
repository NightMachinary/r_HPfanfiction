I have a guilty pleasure for stories of length that are HG/HP where you get to see romance blossom until, in the final battle, one of them dies or leading up to the final battle one of them dies. That Scene, the harrowing pain they must go through really gets me.

Also love a good fluffy scene, declaration of love, Harry finding out for the first time he's a powerful wizard in his own right, Duelling scenes that are well written.

I particularly like it when time is taken to introduce new spells rather than "lumos" with Maxima or ultima used to amplify the effect. I'm yet to find a good HP/HG fic where he goes "Dark" unless anybody has a good suggestion?
