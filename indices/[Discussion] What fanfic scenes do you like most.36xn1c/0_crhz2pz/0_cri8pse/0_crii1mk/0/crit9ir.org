I've read too many fics and they all tend to blend together, so the only one that I can remember enough to recommend (because it's one of my very favorite stories) is [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/rhysenn/IP01.html][Irresistible Poison]]. It's really written well, and throughout the entire story there's lots of little details about magic that I thought were really clever. Lupin is the DADA teacher, and how the author uses the class and its homework assignments in a few places to world build and move the plot along is very well done.
