I like fluffy romantic stuff where the characters are already in a relationship. The parts from "To fight the oncoming darkness" where Harry and Susan talk about intentionally forgeting flowers so they can have a pointless argument, scenes showing why Ron and Hermione could actually be a good couple, people cuddling, stuff like that. This is probably on of the reasons why I have a higher tolerance for soulbonds and other stupid shit, because they are plot devices that let you somewhat skip to that part immidatly.

Also, battle-scenes where characters actually act like wizards would in a world where almost everyone has the power of instant teleportation. I.e. lots of hand to hand combat, apparition and shit.
