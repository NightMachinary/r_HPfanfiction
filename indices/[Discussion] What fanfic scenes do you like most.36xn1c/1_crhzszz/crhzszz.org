I like well written, immersive battle scenes. Complete with adrenaline, death, angst, actual reactions. I really liked the two-chapter Battle of Hogwarts in "The Last Spy" for that reason.

I don't care if it's a Death Eater attack, the end of the war, an Order skirmish, or Auror training. These scenes, when done right, are just so much /fun/ to read.
