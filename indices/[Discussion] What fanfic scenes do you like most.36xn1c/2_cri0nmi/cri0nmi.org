I like scenes that highlight character traits in unique ways. Show - don't tell - that Harry has trouble focusing on his schoolwork. Demonstrate that Ron is a Quidditch fanatic with a genuine love of the game. Hint in subtle but consistent ways that Hermione is motivated by praise and values learning.

Even the best world-building falls flat if the characters are just hollow concepts without depth.
