I'll read a good attempt, but I really love a good sex scene that includes a bit of in-scene comedy. It's tricky to maintain or recapture the feeling of intimacy or lustfulness when you have the main character flub an otherwise awesome seduction line or trip gracelessly into the hottub rather than slink in like a porn star.

Also, sex that's sexy between older characters without trying to fetishize the physical shortcomings of age is a rare treat.
