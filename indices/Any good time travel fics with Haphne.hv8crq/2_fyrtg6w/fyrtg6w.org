I really haven't come across too many Haphne Time travel stories. Most have either a Harry/multi or Harry/Hermione/Daphne.

Harry Potter - Three to Backstep by Sinyk comes to mind as Harry, Hermione and Daphne all get sent back.

Daphne is part of a harem when harry goes back in time in the story Ah, Screw It! By mjimeyg

Daphne's Letter from the Future by TomHRichardson again has Daphne sharing Harry with Hermione

linkao3(21665026)

He's Not Dead Yet by Redbayly has Daphne with 5 other girls when Harry is sent back.
