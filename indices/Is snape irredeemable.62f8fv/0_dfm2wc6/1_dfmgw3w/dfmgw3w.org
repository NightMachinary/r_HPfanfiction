  2) He still joined Voldemort at the beginning. Sure, this itself is redeemable but when added to everything else? He's probably killed and tortured people for fun.

When Dumbledore asked Snape to kill him, he asks "What about my soul?" Doesn't this imply that he hasn't killed before or least not without remorse?

Also he says something like "Lately only those who I could not save" when asked about how many people that he watched die. I would say that you could interpret it as him not liking seeing people die in front of him.

Toward the end, Dumbledore is dead, Harry Potter that he swore to protect is going to die anyway, everyone hates him and thinks that he is a death rater. He could have easily gone back to being a death eater, helped torture students but he didn't and still helped Harry win.

I mean, he definitely isn't a nice or good person, but I believe that especially in the context of fanfiction, it is possible for him to be redeemed (at least if you interpret his character in a certain way and have specific circumstances that make redemption possible). But then again, I do love redemption stories so I may be biased towards thinking that it is possible to find good in characters that do not seem like they have it in them.
