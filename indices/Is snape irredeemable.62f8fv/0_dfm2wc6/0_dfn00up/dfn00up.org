Putting it mildly. Lets consider the horrific ramifications of Neville's boggart.

- The kid was abused by his uncle several times to show magic, including attempted drowning and thrown out of a window. I'm assuming a lot more that just wasn't said, too.\\
- His parents were driven insane by the first cousin of "Voldemort's right hand man" who has just escaped from super prison that no one has ever done so before.\\
- The guards of said jail are soul sucking aura of despair monsters, that will not discriminate according to Dumbledore. Said monsters attacked Harry Potter in front of him.\\
- Just last year a monster was screwing around the school randomly petrifying people, and got several students his age.

Yet his biggest fear is his high school chemistry teacher basically. Even Walter White's students wouldn't have said him.
