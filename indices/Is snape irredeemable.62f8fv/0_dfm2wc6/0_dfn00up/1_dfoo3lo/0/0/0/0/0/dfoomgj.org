Florian is perfect, I don't think Moody would be good for Hank though. Hank is much less competent and confrontational, I would go for John Dawlish for that.

Greyback is obviously Jack Welker (white supremacy gang leader).

Leonel and Marco Salamanca would be by Carrow siblings...

Now I've put far too much thought into this lol.
