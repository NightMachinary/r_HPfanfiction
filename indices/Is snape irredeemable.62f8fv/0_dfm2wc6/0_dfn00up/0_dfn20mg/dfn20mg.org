I never understood that. How did no one see this and decide "Huh. Maybe we need to have a Parent-Teacher conference or something." Lupin didn't say anything. The kids spread the rumor until everyone in Hogwarts had heard it. And what? Nothing was done.

This is one of several moments in the series that convinced me wizards don't care for their young. Or at least view child endangerment totally differently. (Another was when Hagrid takes Harry, Ron, and Malfoy, who are all known to (1) be stupid and (2) not get along, to the forest filled with dangerous animals and has them split up).
