No, Snape is not irredeemable. People make mistakes, and if their future actions show that they do regret those mistakes and that they really are trying to fix them and are sacrificing things for that goal and trying to be the better person, it can and often enough does redeem them.

Snape has all of that, except for the last one. He does regret sending Lily to her death, whatever the reason behind that regret. He is trying to fix what he did by working against Tom and his merry bunch. And he is sacrificing things for that goal.

The problem is, in acting on the envy he feels for Harry for being the one Lily chose, an envy for her one and only child which makes it blind envy, he does show that he is not trying to become a better person. This very much is his own ghost to fight against, though, and is it not a stretch to say that it always was possibly for him to try to ignore that envy and do right by the people he is surrounded by. And the problem is exacerbated by the fact that many a writer simply do not know how to write a realistic Snape who would choose that path. He is a flawed person, very flawed, and those flaws define him; for a story to portray him accurately it does have to give him either those flaws or an actual reason not to have them, which actually is quite hard. And it gets /even harder/ when you realise that due to the standard of interactions we see between Harry and Snape in canon it becomes close to impossible to say anything about his redemption or lack of thereof if the Harry in a given story is egging him on, as Snape's flaws mean that he /will/ lash out if he is egged on even if he is attempting to be the better person.

It is for the last reason that it's hard to say whether or not Snape got his redemption in “Seventh Horcrux”, for example; his behaviour is not much different from that in canon, but at the end he is pretty much a tired old man (though not “old” old), but he does seem to be lashing out at people, but both of those people (Harry and Sirius) are egging him on.

For what it's worth, I did feel that he redeemed himself in a story called “Digging for the Bones”. It is a story in which he actually is Harry's father (open spoiler so I don't feel guilty about just writing it), for reasons that actually do make sense and do not make Lily into a harlot or something along those lines, and he is kept just as flawed there as he is in canon, he does have the very core of what made him “Severus Snape”, he has his cutting remarks and his tendency to jump to conclusions and many other traits that make him him. And it is a story in which, despite the fact that not everything is right at the end, despite the fact that it would probably take just as many words as the story has to explore all the things that it left hanging with the implication that they will be problems for the two in the future, it's also alright because he worked hard to get over himself and become a better person. It is a bit of an angsty story, I do admit, due to dealing with issues that generally tend to end up very upsetting emotionally and doing it realistically, but it has quite enough of those heart-warming moments when you would normally expect something but then Snape does something else instead, something that shows that he really is trying even if it is not easy for him. If you aren't put off by the open spoiler bit, I wholeheartedly recommend it.
