  In my opinion he doesn't even have to 'come back to the light' to help. He just has to really hate Voldemort. I would call that selfish not a seeing of the light.

yeah, but what evidence is there that he /is/ doing out of hatred for voldemort, or revenge or whatever, and how is that incoherent with him bullying students? i've never seen anyone actually prove this.
