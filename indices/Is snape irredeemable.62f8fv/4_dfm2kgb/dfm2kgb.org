Does he have to be redeemed completely to cancel out some of his acts? Can he die in a neutral state?

I think you're forgetting his treatment of Neville. Unless Frank or Alice did something to him he bullies Neville because he can. That means he could be doing it to others outside of Harry's class too. He's ridiculously petty and awful. He had years before Voldemort came back when he could have tried to be a decent human being but remained awful. Nothing can excuse the way he behaved but equally he did contribute in the second war. I say equally but even if he did help it cannot undo the damage he did in the first war and possibly while keeping his cover in the second. In my opinion he doesn't even have to 'come back to the light' to help. He just has to really hate Voldemort. I would call that selfish not a seeing of the light.

I don't think Snape joined Voldemort for the blood issue but for a fraction of Voldemort's power. Therefore him not killing muggleborns and muggles in the second war doesn't make him good, it just means he's not bad, unfortunately for him by that point he was so far into the negatives on the good-bad scale he was doomed.

Edit: if you didn't already know, the bottom of the fanfiction filters, the bit underneath 'Without' allows you to filter out every story where Snape is listed as a major character. I use it to filter out Snape and Hermione, its not perfect since they can crop up as background characters but it might help if you didn't know already.
