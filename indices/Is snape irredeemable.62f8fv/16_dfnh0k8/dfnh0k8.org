Yes, he is a petty small minded pathetic bully of a man (despite his brilliance in magic and potions - look at his potions text that Harry uses in 6th year!) who holds a grudge like a motherfucker and takes his anger and self-loathing (not to mention his inadequacy issues and low self-esteem!) out on children and yes:

I think he is irredeemable, the only thing tethering him to the light side at all is that he killed his fucking best friend (ok: And having a debt to Dumbledore who kept him out of Azkaban) who he was in love with and tries to atone for it

It's tragic, but I still loath him and I'd have killed him in Harry's place (probably after Sirius died or earlier: After Pettigrew escaped, partly because of him!), sadly canon Harry is too much of a goody two shoes (sorry, I don't have a problem with being nice to people who haven't done anything to you - but sitting down and just taking abuse (and Snape is abusing the students, he's in a position of power over them and loves putting them down to prop himself up and feel good!) is not something I like (and I have been bullied at school for 5 years (!) - I was powerless to stop it back then (parents and teachers didn't really try, they didn't want to expell the bullies!), but today I'd take those bullies to court (something my parents sadly didn't do...they didn't even sue the school for not providing a save learning environment, despite the fees they payed for that school (private catholic school - and they ask me why I think there is no god, if Christians can ignore bullying like that then I don't want their god to be real and if it turns out he is? Well fuck you god! You are a douchebag!)!)

ps: So I am kind of in Snapes shoes (I just don't teach, but even if I would be teaching I'd not take their parents actions into account when forming oppinions about their offspring - I might take a closer look at them than at other kids, but I would not punish them harsher etc.!)
