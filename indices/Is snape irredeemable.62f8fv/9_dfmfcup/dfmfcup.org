Snape as the character he is, absolutely irredeemable.

Snape as the character Rowling wanted him to be, totally different question.

I think Rowling wanted to write a grumpy, emotionally scarred character who made a (albeit terrible) mistake when he was a teenager, and this is the only way to make up for the harm caused because of it. Instead, because we're reading a children's book that just sort of morphed into YA literature, we're seeing Rowling's evolution as a writer. Don't get me wrong, she's a fantastic author. But a lot of the problems we see in the book, and yes, in Snape's character, are from her not being sure where to take the plot, and therefore his character development. In addition, this is being written from 3rd person limited, and Harry's perspective almost exclusively (exceptions being the prologues). We have only ever seen what Harry has seen and thought about something.

So, as he is, terrible human being who needed to chill it with the Lily obsession.

As the character I think he was meant to be, probably okay.
