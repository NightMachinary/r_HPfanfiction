I think there are two separate issues here.

One, there's Snape's crimes as a Death Eater. He is, I think, redeemed there. One can dismiss his heroism in spying for Dumbledore --- which wasn't limited to gathering information --- as motivated by revenge, but his reluctance to kill Dumbledore in cold blood, even at Dumbledore's request, is evidence that he had repented of that and stands redeemed.

Two, his being a petty, vindictive, generally unpleasant person, who bullies children and abuses authority, is a lesser crime but one of which he has never repented. The only mitigating factor there was the need to maintain his cover; but anything over and above that, he stands guilty.
