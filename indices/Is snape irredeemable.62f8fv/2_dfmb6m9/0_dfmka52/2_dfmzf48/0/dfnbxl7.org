I... think that's a complicated question. We're really never given any explanation for how the killing curse works except for when Moody talks about it a single time in Harry's 4th year at Hogwarts.

I'm willing to bet his explanation was bullshit for a simple reason. Consider:

1. Pretty much every Death Eater is able to cast the curse.
2. Quite a few Aurors are able to cast the curse.

Now, we all know that the Death Eaters are fanatical. But can they truly all be /evil people/? Quite a few of them are like Draco Malfoy. Raised in an environment where they're taught a set of beliefs. A belief system which they're simultaneously grown up indoctrinated to believe is under attack by inferior beings.

Can each Death Eater possibly have enough hate against EACH INDIVIDUAL person they fight against? It seems unlikely.

Aurors are another step removed. In war-time, we're told that Crouch Sr. authorized the use of Unforgivables (possibly specifically against Death Eaters, but I can't remember).

Now Aurors are just doing their job. Granted, they're often fighting for their lives, but is it likely that they can have enough hate against EACH INDIVIDUAL Death Eater? Again, I think that's unlikely.

So assuming that you have to hate for the curse to function /at all/, I can't believe that you have to hate the /specific person/ you're using the curse on.

I think it's likely you don't have to hate a specific person /at all/, rather any hatred would suffice. This hatred can come in form against a person, an idea, a situation, memories, etc.

Snape has had a fucked up life. Some of it was his fault, certainly, but fucked up nonetheless. I don't find it difficult to believe that he could have summoned some hate from somewhere.
