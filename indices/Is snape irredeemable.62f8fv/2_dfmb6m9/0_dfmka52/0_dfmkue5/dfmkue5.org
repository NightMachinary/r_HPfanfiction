Do you mean that if he had been quick to cast the killing curse at Dumbledore that it would have shown redemption?

Snape as far as we saw in his memories was reluctant to kill Dumbledore because he respected him. Also he did kill Dumbledore as he was asked because he knew Dumbledore was right. I'd say if he hadn't been redeemed he wouldn't have done as Dumbledore asked at all.
