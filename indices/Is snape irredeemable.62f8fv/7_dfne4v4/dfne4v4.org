I think there are three questions, really, at place here.

1. What does "redeemed" mean?
2. Is Severus Snape's character redeemable?
3. Is Severus Snape's character redeemed by the time he dies?

* What does "Redeemed" mean?
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: what-does-redeemed-mean
  :END:
[[http://i.imgur.com/j5UPAda.png]["compensate for the faults or bad aspects of (something)."]]

*What does "compensate" mean?*

[[http://i.imgur.com/9OtUNT3.png]["make up for (something unwelcome or unpleasant) by exerting an opposite force or effect."]]

Things that "redeemed", in the context of *2* and *3*, /doesn't mean/:

1. Is Snape a good person?
2. Is Snape a nice person?
3. Is Snape an evil person?
4. Is Snape an asshole?

What we're /really/ trying to ascertain is: */Did Snape contribute to the world a more positive impact than a negative one?/*

* Is Severus Snape's character redeemable?
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: is-severus-snapes-character-redeemable
  :END:
Given enough time, assuming the trend of contribution is in any form net positive, no amount of negative contributions to the world can be considered irredeemable.

There are, I'm sure, negative impacts a person can contribute to the world that cannot be counter-balanced by equally opposite positive things in a reasonable time-frame. Like mass-genocide.

Snape, however, isn't Hitler. Given the course of his life being unhindered by his sticky death by Voldemort's pet horcrux Nagini, I personally believe that Snape's character would have eventually redeemed himself (not to say he wasn't - I haven't reached the third question, yet).

So: *Is Severus Snape's character redeemable?*

Certainly. And without question.

* Is Severus Snape's character redeemed by the time he dies?

This is a much more difficult question to /cover/, but not to /answer/.

I'm not going to include every negative thing Snape has ever done. This isn't amount tallying how many negative and positive individual acts Snape has performed and determining which list has the most rows but, rather, speculating on the impact each of those choices has and comparing their relative reach and importance.

** Pre-Spy Death Eater
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: pre-spy-death-eater
   :END:
Despite this being one of the things people love to latch onto, I honestly believe that this period of Snape's life is pretty tame, in regards to positive/negative contribution.

Yes, the Death Eaters were labeled as a terrorist organization by the Ministry of Magic.

Yes, the Death Eaters were - objectively, even - a group of racists and xenophobes, comparable to the magical version of modern-day Neo-Nazis.

However, it is never /ever/ discussed what Snape's /role was/ as a Death Eater. As a matter-a-fact, it's very likely that his main occupation within the Death Eaters was to brew potions. It's often mentioned later in the series that, as an inner-circle Death Eater, that's what his function was. I see no reason why that /wouldn't/ have been his function earlier in his life.

Snape was a bitter and angry teenager who grew up with an abusive father. While he was going to a boarding school for 10 months out of the year, he lived with children who gave him friendship and groomed him to follow and believe in their ideals.

While Snape was a half-blood and raised in the muggle world, he was still indoctrinated like many other characters such as Draco Malfoy. I can't consider /just joining the Death Eaters/ as a huge negative.

The only /proven and irrefutable/ thing that Snape did as a Death Eater was /purposefully/ hand information to the Dark Lord Voldemort that he should have realized would lead to the death of /somebody/. This somebody, to his dismay, was Lily Potter nee Evans.

** Attempting to spare Lily (via Voldemort)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: attempting-to-spare-lily-via-voldemort
   :END:
Snape, knowing the Dark Lord would have to go after the Potter family, asked Voldemort to spare Lily's life. His friend. The only person he ever held any romantic feelings for.

I do /not see this as a bad thing/.

Realistically - and Snape is nothing if not a realistic, if perhaps a bit too cynical - there was no fucking way he could have convinced Voldemort to spare the entire family.

He didn't do /nothing/, and attempting to spare /anyone/ is a net-positive. Even if his reasons were selfish.

** Attempting to spare Lily (via Spying for Dumbledore)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: attempting-to-spare-lily-via-spying-for-dumbledore
   :END:
Many people will criticize Snape for going to Dumbledore and not asking about sparing James and Harry, as well.

While there was certainly no reason to /not/ ask for them to be saved, I'm not sure why people make a big deal out of it.

Do you honestly believe that Snape was under the impression that Dumbledore would have only protected Lily? Why is the distinction important?

LET US BE CLEAR ABOUT THIS POINT:

Snape was FULLY AWARE that going to Dumbledore would result in James and Harry Potter being saved. Nothing else makes sense. Dumbledore asking for that clarification was HIS OWN MANIPULATION of Snape.

The fact that people don't see that is truly baffling to me.

** Spying for Dumbledore
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: spying-for-dumbledore
   :END:
This section alone is huge.

Snape, throughout the books, is identified of having reported:

1. The dates, times and force involved of attacks against homes and businesses.
2. Plans that Voldemort is attempting to follow through on.
3. information about known (to him) Death Eaters.
4. False information to Voldemort about the Order's plans/members.

Trying to gauge the sheer number of lives that Snape saved while spying for Dumbledore is staggering. Truly staggering.

How many times did Snape come through when no one else could?

** The occasions when Snape /saved lives/
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: the-occasions-when-snape-saved-lives
   :END:

1. Attempted to save Lily/James/Harry.
2. Saved Harry from falling off his broom.
3. Later refereed a match to prevent it from happening again.
4. Brewed the potion to de-petrify students.
5. Saved the Ministry Six by informing the Order about them leaving school. "Padfoot's was taken to the place where it's hidden" indeed.
6. Saved Katy Bell's life from Draco's failed attempt to kill Dumbledore.
7. Saved Draco's life from Harry's /sectumsempra/.
8. Spared Draco having to kill Dumbledore.

** Conclusion
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: conclusion
   :END:
Snape is, objectively, an asshole. He's also petty and a horrible teacher.

But through his acts he saved /hundreds/ if not /thousands/ of people both directly and indirectly.

The idea that anyone can think of Snape as /irredeemable/ if fucking /astounding/ to me.

Outside of Harry and Dumbledore, Snape was singlehandedly the most instrumental character in the books to bringing Voldemort to his demise.

Snape, outside of Dumbledore, saved more people's lives than any other character in the series. Yes, including Harry.

His motives may have not always been innocent. He may have been cruel while doing it.

But Snape was *by far* a redeemed character.
