I agree with almost all points so far and thinks Snape is no hero.

Does anyone know if the Longbottoms were attacked because of the Prophecy Snape told Voldemort about. Because if the prophecy was the reason Snapes lack of remorse and his attitude towards Neville would be in my opinion unforgivable.
