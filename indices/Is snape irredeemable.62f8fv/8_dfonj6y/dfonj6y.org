I think he's a very complicated and sympathetic character, even if I wouldn't be friends with him.

In the real world, do we look at people who have joined a gang at 17 and got out at 19 as irredeemable for life? Harry was born when Lily was 20, which means that Snape would have been 19-20 at the time when he had turned his back on Voldemort for the rest of his life, which is 18 years in total. Only 3 of those years were spent actually fighting in a war, which means that he had spent the same time or a bit more as a spy for the Order than he did actually Death Eating. So, as an actual adult, he was risking his life to fight for the right side. In essence, he had joined a gang in high school, and as a result, his only childhood friend died, so he spent the rest of his life atoning for it by going undercover.

He might have been an asshole, yes, but he's still a war hero. Having a shitty personality =/= evil. He probably shouldn't have been teaching, but I'm guessing Dumbledore wanted to keep an eye on him. If we look at the bigger picture, the ministry employees who sent thousands of muggleborns to their deaths were all probably perfectly pleasant with nice little families, just like in Nazi Germany. Snape's role was more high-risk and important.

I think Snape is brilliantly written. He's very clearly severely dysphoric, depressed and never had the chance to get over his teenage grievances, just like Sirius, but for different reasons. You can notice that Lupin turned out a lot more mature than those two because he had the chance to wallow about in the real world and grow up. Sirius and Snape, on the other hand, are two overgrown teenagers. They're 35 by OotP, and yet neither has gotten over their respective childhoods and teenage animosity, because neither has had the chance to move on. Of course, Snape was not in prison, but I'm going to guess highly depended on Dumbledore and restricted in movement, and not exactly welcomed back into society.

If you think back on Snape joining the teaching force, he was 21 and dealing with the fall of Voldemort, his recent arrest and Lily's death. You'd notice that half of the children he was teaching were around to see him floating upside down and got a good look at his underwear. If he didn't become a scary overgrown bat, they would have eaten him alive back there. Of course, it is higly unprofessional and petty, but Snape is not a mature person.

Of course, we also have to remember that JKR wrote him in a book for children and he was initially a very cartoonish children's decoy villain for about two books, just your typical evil teacher. The Dursleys were like that at first, if you look at the first two books and take them at face value, they're extremely violently abusive, but in a children's book they're more like a cartoon representation of a cold family mistreating an orphan. After PoA, the tone shifts and Snape slowly grows a personality along with the rest of them.
