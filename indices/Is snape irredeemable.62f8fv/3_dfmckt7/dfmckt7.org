Snape was never a hero he was an antihero. As for being irredeemable I'd say he did redeem himself in the end. By spying on Voldemort and ensuring that Harry was safe from Voldemort.

If you look back he defended Harry against Quirrelmort's curse in book 1. In book 2 he acknowledged that Harry didn't petrify Filtch's cat. Book 3 where everyone loves to bash Snape he clearly went out to the shrieking shack to save Harry and his friends. Even if he refused to listen to Remus and Sirius. I could go on about each incident in every book.

Was Snape a nice guy? No he really wasn't, but being redeemed isn't about shitting sunshine and rainbows it's about trying to make up for your past. Which for him was turning on Voldemort and protecting Harry because he did care for Lily on some level.
