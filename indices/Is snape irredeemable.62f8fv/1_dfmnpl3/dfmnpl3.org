...you seem to be discussing two different things. one is if snape was a good person, the other is if he's redeemable. the logic seems to be 'snape is irredeemable because he's a bad person', which is incoherent. redemption, by definition, can /only/ happen to bad people. which is why characters like scrooge and vader, cruel people and child murderers, have redemptions arcs

i don't think snape joining the DEs, or being a jerk to children, makes him irredeemable
