I see a lot of people mentioning that quote with snape asking about his soul when dumbledore asks severus to help albus with his proxy suicide.

Did anyone stop to think that severus was saying that in a very literal sense that his soul might crack and dumbledore was being an ass and talking about a consience instead?

Magic is real in this universe. Souls are real in this universe. Killing someone with a killing curse, the absolute desire to kill being a requirement for it to work, could possibly have very real consequences.
