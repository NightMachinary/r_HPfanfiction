Its hard to call someone Irredeemable whos braving the dangers Snape is braving to help the "light", but I can completely understand why folks think he is, and to be honest, I struggle to even come close to saying yes hes redeemable.

His terrible teaching and attitude towards students alone should be the primary reason. But he also turned his back on Lily, joined Voldemort willingly, and had to have murdered and/or raped to do so most likely.

To be honest Ive always questioned the whole story behind the Snape/Lily/Voldemort interaction. Lily would obviously not "fall in love" with Snape as a death eater or who he was at the end of Hogwarts and post Hogwarts. So even if Voldemort had spared Lily, what would that of done? If Snape was that broken up by her death, would he have been able to and willing to force her into a slave position, or feed her love potions or kidnap her or whatever he would of done since she would not of willingly been with him?

It just strikes me as odd...
