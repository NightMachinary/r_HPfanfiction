i hate snape, there is nothing good about the character.

1. he was obsessed with lily and wanted voldemort to only spare her, once voldermort killed her he ran to dumbledore for revenge.

2. he is right bastard to neville and harry once again show he doesnt give a damn about anyone but himself.

3. he is useless as spy and never in the series he did somthing useful for the order.

4. even his "heroic" death was just voldemort making a mistake.

5. he mind rape harry potter instead of teaching him for his sick pleasure.
