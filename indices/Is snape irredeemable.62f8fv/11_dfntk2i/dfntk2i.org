We know from canon that to become a healer, potion master or auror, you need to have potion NEWTs. If we combine that with Snapes horrible teaching as well as his requirements of an O to be able to go to NEWT classes, we can easily assume that he solely was responsible for the decline of all three professions. And two of them were actually important for the war, so due to the shit he was pulling he helped Voldemort immensely to help win the war.
