No one is truly irredeemable. There is always a chance for grace and mercy, so long as one repents. So the real question is this: Does Snape ever repent of his evil deeds? That's a complicated, murky question. He certainly never made himself like able (and honest to God, I don't understand how ANYONE thinks he should be shipped with anything other than a therapist and a life skills coach) and her certainly never acted as though he felt any remorse except for the death of Lily Potter.

That said, ultimately he was willing to give his life to save Harry's own and to make the world a better place. Greater Love has no man than this, that he lay down his life for his brother. Snape did do that. Was that act alone enough for redemption? As long as we're not talking about a spiritual sense, yes, that is enough. His final act was to reach for the light and repent; that was enough to redeem him.
