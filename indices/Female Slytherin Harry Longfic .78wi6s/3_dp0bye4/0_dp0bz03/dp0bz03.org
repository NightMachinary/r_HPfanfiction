  Hope Potter was everything Albus Dumbledore feared; a girl just as clever, just as dangerous as Tom Riddle had been. Their physical similarities and likeness blinded him to the truth. That Hope wasn't afraid of befriending a Muggleborn Gryffindor or even a Slytherin with pro-grey leanings. That Hope Potter was an unpredictable pawn on his chessboard. FemHarry
