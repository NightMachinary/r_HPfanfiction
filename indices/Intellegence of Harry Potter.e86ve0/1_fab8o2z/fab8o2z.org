I like authors who take the time and focus his intelligence more on his friendship base, which happens a lot in fics where he's sorted into another house. I prefer these because it's more realistic, when he develops a different friend group suddenly he doesn't have Hermione giving him all the answers and Ron distracting him, he's forced to actually apply himself and work hard, as a result of that he usually becomes above average.
