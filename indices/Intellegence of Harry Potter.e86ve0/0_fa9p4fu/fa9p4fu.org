It's a common trope for all HP fan fic protagonists and if it's not Dumbledore, Riddle, Grindelwald, and Flamel it's off.

But also average student =/= average intelligence. We are told at least twice the fear of death gets in Harry's way and HBP and DH have quite a few moments of Harry /understanding/ magic.

Lastly, it's fan fiction centered around an almost shallow reader insert. You don't have to read it.
