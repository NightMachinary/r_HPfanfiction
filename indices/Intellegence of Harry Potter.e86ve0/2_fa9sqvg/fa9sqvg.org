  Harry seems more like an average student. mainly c's and b's with 1 or too A's

Harry got mostly B's in his real subjects on his OWLs.

Harry's OWLs

Astronomy: A

Care of Magical Creatures: E

Charms: E

Defense Against the Dark Arts: O

Divination: P

Herbology: E

History of Magic: D

Potions: E

Transfiguration: E

History of Magic and Divination are pointless and don't really matter, and his Astronomy exam got interrupted by the attack on Hagrid and McGonagall during the exam. He was pretty preoccupied with the DA, his problems with Umbridge, his visions from Voldemort, etc, that year, so it's reasonable to assume he could have gotten mostly O's if he applied himself to academics more.
