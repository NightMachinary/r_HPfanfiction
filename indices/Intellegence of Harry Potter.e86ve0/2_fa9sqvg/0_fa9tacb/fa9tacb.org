History of Magic is not pointless. Also, since it's not a magical exam, it's the only one for which we get an actual insight into its subject matter, and it seems that Hermione's notes were quite detailed and he absorbed them well. It's just that the exam got interrupted by the vision, he probably would have managed an E or A there.
