Well, in The Cursed Child its mentioned that Petunia kept the blanket in which Harry was wrapped as it was the only thing reminding her of Lily. If we consider that story canon, we could assume that fem Harry would be treated /better/ since Petunia would see it as a second chance - she clearly has regrets.

If we are sticking strictly to the original books its a bit harder to say. If she sees Lily as someone who abandoned family for magic, fem Harry might have it worse.

On the other hand, if she sees the magic community as the bad guys then it would make sense for her to hate boy Harry more since he looks like the wizard who "stole" Lily away.

Also, since Dursley household appears to be quite "traditional" fem Harry would probably have an easier time in general. Like they probably wouldn't allow Dudley to hit her or might even tell him to protect her?

She might get better clothes, since /normal/ appearance standards for girls are higher than for boys etc.
