Also I think Petunia keeping Harry's blanket is a bit of a character development as far someone horrible like Petunia can go. It shows regret of how she treated Harry and specially her relationship with Lily, but yes, I don't think 'Henrietta Potter' formative years would be easier. Probably female Harry would get more mysoginistic abuse from Petunia since she would project Lily and narcisistic rage on her. Petunia was simply not right in the head.
