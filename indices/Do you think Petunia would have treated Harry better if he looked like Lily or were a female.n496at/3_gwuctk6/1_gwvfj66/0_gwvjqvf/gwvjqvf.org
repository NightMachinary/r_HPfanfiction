lol we only see her interact with dudes in canon. But the way she interacts with them tells me she has some ideas about a woman's role in society.

Plus she's written by a terf who is riddled with internalised misogyny as seen in the way she wrote literally every female character.

not here for a debate though, just sharing my opinion on her character to answer OP's question
