Forging the Sword isn't a oneshot, but it is a /great/ trio fic! One of my favorites, hands down. Excellent writing, awesome plot, great characterization. It's not exactly what you want - if you just want heartwarming moments, searching for drabbles might be a better idea. That said, my view of the fic might have been obscured a bit due to the passage of time, so I might be glorifying it a bit more than it deserves. Either way, give it a try.
