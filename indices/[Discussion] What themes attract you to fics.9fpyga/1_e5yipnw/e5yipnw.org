*Motivations*

In some ways, the books can actually be fairly subtle when it comes to characterization. What initially seem like hollow characters actually have a good amount of thought behind them.

There are the morally complex.

Memorable characters like Dumbledore, Snape, Sirius, James Potter, Percy, and Lupin aren't wholly black or white. Dumbledore is especially interesting since he roller coasters from kindly old mentor to hero with clay feet, proving himself human in the process.

Then there are those with complex natures, or motivations that are more interesting than they seem at first glance. Some of them are the same characters.

Dumbledore, for well-known reasons. Snape for the same. Pettigrew, the talented, yet sniveling traitorous coward. Umbridge, who is an inferiority complex wedded to the perfect little tyrant. Hermione Granger, the overbearing perfectionist who breaks rules when it suits her. Sirius, the pure-blood wizard who broke so thoroughly with his family's worldview that he was cast out as a youth. Slughorn, a man who truly believes in ambition and talent, but not if it completely bankrupts one's morals.

There are also characters will simpler motives for doing what they do.

Bigotry, like that of Bellatrix Lestrange, the Malfoys, and so many other blood supremacists. Doing the decent thing, like Harry and Ron. The need for control, even over death, like Voldemort (who would be an almost textbook psychopath if not for that pesky fear of his).

They all have reasons behind things, rarely just doing them for the heck of it. Some of the reasons are half-seen. There's lot to be inferred from what the reader doesn't view in full, little hints of greater stories.

/Any fics that can give good motivations to characters, either by emulating, extrapolating, expanding, or spinning-off those in canon, gets my attention./

*The Allure of the Dark Arts*

But not an allure that's ultimately edgy and full of needless angst and diatribes about all things Dark being misunderstood.

(gag)

Okay, it's a little more complicated than that, and it ties into my first "theme."

I know a good Dark Arts fic when I see it -- a slow slide down the slippery slope, or the occasional gleeful jump off the edge of it.

But there should be a reason for going down that slope in the first place ...

... one that convinces me that the characters couldn't be doing anything else. Half because they want it, and half because they are in thrall to the spells they're using.

Dark magic ought to be as seductive as it is dangerous, and that should be clear in every spell and every awful deed. Most of the spells classified as Dark mean literally having death on the tip of a wand. No one should come by such magic lightly, or without cost, or just "because," which is what the decent stories show.

/A good Dark Arts fic ties character motivations/goals into their pursuit of a magic that is both powerful and devious./

(I'm half asleep right about now and up way too late, but this discussion was so interesting that I couldn't pass it up, and I hope everything I wrote makes some sort of sense without too many spelling errors.)
