Hey, that's an interesting perspective on "mugglewank" I haven't seen before. Contemporary muggle culture having the flaw of being consumerist / a capitalistic hellscape, that is.

Anyway, there are a few themes that I found attractive:

*Muggle/Magic Cultural Differences*

I love fics that explore muggle-borns finding their place in wizarding society and on the polar opposite pure-bloods fighting to adapt in a muggle world. This is why I adore fics that toy around the idea of the consequences of breaking/toeing the Statute of Secrecy, having serious long-term muggle/magic relationships, or doing business with folks "on the other side".

I've personally been thinking of a concept of a muggle/magic black market for a fic (feat. e.g. wizards trading ambiguously magical items) but I don't think I could rather pull it off just yet.

Too ambitious.

*Magical Morality and Ethics*

Here's a case study, still somewhat related to the theme above.

/In HBP, Hermione sicced a bunch of actively attacking canaries on Ron -- an action that would have proven fatal in the non-magical world./

/But they weren't in one./

Still though, Ron got multitudes of scars that even magic couldn't heal. And if these canaries acted like actual canaries, he would've lost his eyes had he not shielded them fast enough -- could magic re-grow eyes? He also, while a jerk, wasn't being actively aggressive towards Hermione. Some people also say that since magic acted as an equalizer, Hermione doesn't have the "she's a girl" excuse (not that, IMO, it's a valid excuse; just bringing it up) since what's relevant is their magical prowess. And Hermione is more magically inclined than Ron, so she was the more powerful party among both of them.

But violence is also normalized in the wizarding world. Hitting speeding, heavy balls towards the opposition isn't only legal in Quidditch; it's a /part/ of it. So one could argue that Hermione was only adapting to wizarding culture and that the whole thing was not to be taken as it would be in a muggle context.

The question: /How much should Hermione be called out on her action?/

I could go on and on, particularly with Fred and George's disturbing idea of humor, but you get the idea. One fic that comes to mind is The Heinz Dilemma; be aware, though, it gets preachy in the end.
