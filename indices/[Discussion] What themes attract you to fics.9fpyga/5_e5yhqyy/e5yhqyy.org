Story's where the supporting characters go through as much development as the main character. And not “i hate the world and am edgy” to “I'm a moderately normal human”. Use of subplots to do this is best. That and showing and doing not saying. I hate it when a character says I am doing this because..... rather than the type of character they are through actions or reactions and using that as a justification for a future action without blatantly saying it
