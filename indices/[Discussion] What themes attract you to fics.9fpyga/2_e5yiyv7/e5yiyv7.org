Some themes I enjoy:

*Critical Thinking*

Canon has a lack of it and completely derailing the canon plot by characters suddenly employing critical thinking skills gives me great enjoyment. It is particularly intriguing when it comes into conflict with a Magical World, where people are conditioned to take things at face value (maybe because Magic sometimes lacks logic). There's a lot of interesting stuff that can be done with it, which is why I like HPMOR so much, but I don't necessarily want all that "sciency" stuff.

*Characters going their own way*

This kind of follows the first theme, but I think it warrants its own point. I'm not talking about the usual independent!Harry stories, because those can often be summarized with "I'm always right and anyone who disagrees with me is my enemy" or worse "might makes right".

It's no secret that I don't like Dumbledore very much and I just want to see people doing something on their own (as individuals or as a group) instead of getting lead by the nose. Similarly I don't want them to be railroaded by the plot, which is another problem in canon (for example: Hermione only being allowed to be smart when it is convenient to the plot).

*The power of friendship, family and love*

Yeah it's cheesy the way I've written it, but this is clearly one of the central themes of the books. Lots of fanfiction writers tend to snub at that, which can be fun too, but all the dark gritty edgelord fiction can become pretty tiring.

I disagree with Rowling in many ways on her definitions of friendship (Ron), family (Weasleys) and love (Snape), which is why I like stories that follow the same themes but execute them better.
