I like reading romance fan fictions, especially if there is a taboo aspect to it. Slow build up with growth in the characters and relationship. I like them even better when the fic is more then just a romance story and it's not the main focus but a sub plot that compliments the character growth. I don't know if I am making any sense. I apologize.
