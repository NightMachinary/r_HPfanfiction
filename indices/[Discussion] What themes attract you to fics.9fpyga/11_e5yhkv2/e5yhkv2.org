The struggle against Nazism and bigotry. Also, the struggle for equal rights. I hate stories where the global scope of human rights, one of the greatest achievements of humanity, no matter how imperfectly it's enforced in our world, is dismissed, either openly, or in a veiled manner by ignoring them, as not applicable "because magic". When it comes down to it, Harry Potter, for me, is a story about three friends defying all odds and fighting for what is right - to the end. It's not a story about magic - magic is merely part of the setting. An important part, but not an absolutely essential part. It's a story about humans.
