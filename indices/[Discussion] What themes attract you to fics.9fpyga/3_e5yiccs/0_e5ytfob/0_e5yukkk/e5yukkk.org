  In canon, the bad guys like the Malfoys seemed to flaunt their wealth and indulge in consumerism, while the poor Weasleys were the tight-knit happy big family.

The Weasleys are only poor in the sense that they can't afford all the same luxury items as everyone else, which is probably the most capitalistic/status-based definition of poor that you can have. They own their own house, have a huge garden are all highly educated and have all the tools, including magic, at their disposal to be basically self sufficient. Yet they are seen as poor because they can't afford the latest Nimbus 2000.

Their status within their world is probably one of the best arguments (that I didn't come up with in my post) why the Wizarding World isn't very impressed with the simple good life (also no-one appears to pursue that anyway).
