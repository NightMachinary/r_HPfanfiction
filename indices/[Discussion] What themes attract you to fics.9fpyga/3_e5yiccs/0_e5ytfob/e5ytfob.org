  but criticizing stories for bringing consumerism into the "pure" magical world just sounds flat out wrong to my ears.

In canon, the bad guys like the Malfoys seemed to flaunt their wealth and indulge in consumerism, while the poor Weasleys were the tight-knit happy big family.

On the other hand, Weasley kids seemed to hate their material/monetary scarcities, and would later become big money raking operators.

This Wizarding world was just as consumerist and materialistic as the Muggle world, if not more so. At least we are still aware of some of the damages we are causing, hence the green parties, sustainability drives, billions of R&D money and government incentives into promoting anything "green", and of course people like Taure who think we suck. In Magical Britain, their sense of superiority reigned supreme and they didn't seem to want to change at all.
