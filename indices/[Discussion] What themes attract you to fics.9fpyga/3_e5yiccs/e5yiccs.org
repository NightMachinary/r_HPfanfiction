  The "Good Life"

  Another preference is that I enjoy stories which depict an alternative to modern consumerist society, one where people live closer to the natural world and life is not about the consumption of entertainment media/acquisition of consumer goods.

  For this reason I dislike stories where Muggle consumer culture is imported into the wizarding world or wizarding society is depicted as somehow lacking/"backwards" because they have less of a focus on consumer goods/entertainment. Rather I am interested in stories which depict a wizarding society where people spend their time on more "wholesome" pursuits - quality time with family and friends, gardening, adventurous travel, etc.

This confuses me. I've always seen large parts of the Wizarding World as a persiflage by Rowling of our mores in society. It's why we see corrupt politicians, idiotic Bureaucracy that doesn't get anything done, greedy bankers and - yes - ridiculous consumerism (teen witch weekly, shopping districts, popular broom brands, spectator sports and team affiliations, Berty Botts Beans, collectible trading cards, Celestina Warbeck, the main news media are firmly in the hand of private interest... I could go on).

There's no reason to 'import' muggle consumerist culture into the Wizarding world, it is already intimately involved with it and I see no indication that Rowling had any romantic naturalist intentions about the "simple life": People in her world follow a post-industrialization life style. They have jobs (wage earning labor performing often menial tasks that can't be very fulfilling) and consume, follow the news, gossip, etc.

Lots of my fanfiction interests are in contrast to canon, so I don't want to argue against your enjoyments of such themes in AUs (though I personally find this kind of romanticizing of such a lifestyle dubious at best), but criticizing stories for bringing consumerism into the "pure" magical world just sounds flat out wrong to my ears.
