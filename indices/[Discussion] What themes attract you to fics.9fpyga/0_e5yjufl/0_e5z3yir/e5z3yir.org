  Moral/Ethical/Philosophical Dilemmas

This is actually not explored that much in fics. Authors are either in the “good guys don't kill” or “let's go all out against Voldemort” camps. I can think of a few examples or scenarios though:

- An inner circle Death Eater has been spotted in a particular location with his family. Harry has to decide whether to take him out by blowing up the area, thus killing potential innocents; or risking the lives of his own people by ordering a direct assault. How should Harry choose?
- An alternative way to kill Voldemort exists, but requires sacrificing innocent children in a horrible ritual. It's guaranteed to work. Because Voldemort created Horcruxes and greatly weakened his soul, it's possible to reduce the cost of this ritual as not to involve any human sacrifices. However, the modified ritual is not guaranteed to work. Which option should Harry and his friends choose?
- Postwar, it was found that in addition to the Longbottoms, up to several hundreds of Cruciatus victims lie around in Muggle hospitals. A potential cure is in development at DoM, but requires testing on live humans. Several Unspeakables propose to use Death Eaters convicted of murders and torture as test subjects. Some very vindictive DA members also support this proposal, saying it's just fair turnaround, but they want the Trio to have the final word. How should the Trio decide?
- After a major engagement, the DA and Order lost several people due to other's side use of the Killing Curse. Some members suggest to retaliate in kind, since Avada Kedavra bypasses the shield charm and offers significant tactical advantages. On the other hand, Avada Kedavra is still very much a taboo among the populace and its use means losing certain popular support. The leaders also worry that liberal use of this curse has adverse psychological consequences. How should they decide?
