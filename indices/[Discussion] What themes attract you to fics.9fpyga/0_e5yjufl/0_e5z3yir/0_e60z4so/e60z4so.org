You're very imaginative, but the third one doesn't really work. The Cruciatus takes actual sadistic intent to cast, and so the motivations of anyone willing to use it (even on the Death Eaters) are /extremely/ questionable. The dilemma would work better if there were some way to replicate the effects of long-term Cruciatus through some technique that /doesn't/ require an evil caster by default, but that makes the whole scenario rather contrived.

A more real dilemma (albeit one with uncomfortable real-world parallels) involving the Longbottoms would be that in the /HP/ world with a proven Afterlife (and, if God isn't a terrible person in that universe, one where the Longbottoms would presumably recover their intellect), wouldn't it be kinder to kill them rather than let them live in confused suffering?
