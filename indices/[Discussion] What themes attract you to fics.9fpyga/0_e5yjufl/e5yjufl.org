*Adventure*

Whilst this theme is very general, I find I enjoy stories that explore the weird and wonderful, from drier more academic approaches to full-on Indiana-Jones-esque romps, I feel like the world of Harry Potter too often loses its wonder in stories saturated with politics, drama, angst and overly-helpful Goblins.

*Growth Though Error, and Moral/Ethical/Philosophical Dilemmas*

I feel that these often go hand-in-hand, particularly when the protagonist of the story starts with a certain perspective or view or moral compass, and finishes the story having changed (and not always for the better). Learning through making mistakes is one of the most human characteristics available to characters, and very often I find stories that have the protagonists either fall into the trap of never making mistakes, the mistakes being rectified before any lessons are learned despite being of a certain magnitude, or for the mistakes to occur in overly-clich√© ways or otherwise too close to existing tropes.

Whilst a lot of the moral/ethical/philosophical considerations in stories are often difficult to present without smashing a particular ideology over the reader's head, when done well I feel it can provide a really interesting window into some of the more difficult issues that can impact a person's life or growth with maturity and narrative weight.
