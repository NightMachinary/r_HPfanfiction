Compromise.

A lot of people supported Voldemort, some might have just supported his ideas but not got involved. Some of them are from older families that might have piles of gold. The Wizarding world is in chaos. Gold is needed to repair the damage. Where is the line between punishment and justice? How do you satisfy the need some have for vengeance with a society that needs to come together to move forwards. You don't want to go full Treaty of Versailles and create another issue years down the line due to festering resentment.

They say a good compromise is one nobody leaves happy. Can the wizarding world afford to not be happy?

In the epilogue Harry lives happily ever after and marries his best mates sister. Ignoring what makes their relationship tick, because I do think H/G works, its a tiny bubble Harry lives in. The Weasleys are such a huge part of his life and they look after him so well that he never has to leave their bubble when he's in the wizarding world. I want Harry to leave the bubble and compromise on a personal level. I want to see Harry date a pureblood stuck up bitch with terrible views because she's funny, witty and hot. They get on great but he cannot agree with her views. I want a story where that reflects the wider society. Can they compromise? Can they find a middle ground and go forwards together or are they doomed to blow up in another huge fight? It doesn't have to be yes but I think it would be interesting to read.
