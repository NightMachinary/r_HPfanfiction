*Change and Redemption*

I'm a rather idealistic person who wants nothing more than for everyone who isn't a sadistic psychopath to finally stop with their nonsense, share notes and shake hands. I am, thus, a big fan of villains coming to see the errors of their ways, either on their own or through outside interference. Tyrants and villains and murderers need to be removed from positions where they can harm others, given the therapy they desperately need, and then given a chance at a happy, /harmless/ life.

I love remorseful, contrite Pettigrew struggling between his guilt for what he's done and his paranoid fear, I love those stories where Scardemort or Diarymort or some other version of Voldemort comes to admit that murder isn't a very nice thing to do and conquest won't ever really bring him happiness anyway (which doesn't mean he has to go all lovey-dovey-fuzzy about it; it really diminishes the value of such a plotline if it's done through a romance). And that goes for the Malfoys and Filch and whoever you want.

On a related note, I really like seeing the Wizarding World as a whole (or just Hogwarts) become generally a better place for everyone involved. Much more than in our depressingly-inconvenient, magic-less, entropy-riddled world, the /Harry Potter/ world is a universe where if all the magic-users could just stop squibbling and get along, you could very realistically get a heaven on Earth.
