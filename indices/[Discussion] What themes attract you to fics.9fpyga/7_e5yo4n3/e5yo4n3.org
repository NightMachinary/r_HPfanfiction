*Moral Conflict*

Stories where there are deep, real moral disagreements between the different factions interest me far more than obviously good vs obviously evil stories. Like oh no, it's the magic Nazis vs people who want to not do that. There's no possible nuance there - no was there supposed to be- one side is simply wrong. Less clear cut moral divides can draw me in very easily. But don't have stupid references to moral categories as "Oh that's Gray" or shit like that. Sounds ridiculous.

  Magical exhaustion is a fundamentally egalitarian world-building device, in that it means even the most powerful wizards can be rendered completely powerless.

Is that how it's used? I nearly always just see it used to create tension for the MC (especially in crossovers) and it's always boring. In my experience, it's either that or the MC is just so magical that everyone else gets tired after five charms while the MC is a god who can cast for hours.
