Well; It'd be easier to say what I â€˜don't' like in a fic than it would be to say what I do. But, even though I generally enjoy all kinds of things; I've taken the time to compose my all time favorites on an ever growing list that's Much shorter than my ffn favs (which I just use as a read history list).

If you care to see my short list, it's all in a Community here: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Those-Less-Forgotten/124884/99/0/1/0/0/0/0/]]

Although be warned, it's not all HP, that's one of the most common, but it's not the only fanon I fallow.
