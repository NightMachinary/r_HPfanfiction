*The bad side getting royally fucked*

Granted, it is a theme more common in ASOIAF fanfics (usually targeting the Lannisters and Freys), but there's nothing quite like reading how the bad guys are getting defeated, all of their plans fall apart or their big charge is mowed down by superior firepower (ASOIAF Industrialisation SIs for example, or Mass Effect time-travel).

However, I don't enjoy the realisation of this theme in the HP fandom because usually just Harry and not his friends/companions as well. One overpowered character is not very enjoyable to read.
