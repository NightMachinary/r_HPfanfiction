Well, I am sorry then. However I still believe you should have been more clear... It's a Harry Potter fan fiction subreddit afterall. If you have a look around here you will see that when it comes to recommendations they are Harry Potter fanfics so you can't just come and throw something unrelated without any additional explanations.
