uh, what the fuck, cool your jets dude

you asked for stories about sentient magical creatures, no I don't know any fucking harry potter fan-fictions about those things, honestly I don't read a lot of fan-fiction because I think it's better to expand your horizons, but what i did fucking do is give you a god damn recommendation for a book, with a similar vocabulary level and similar writing style that's about the topic you're looking for.

God damn what a fucking rude response are you fucking stupid? I hope you don't find shit.
