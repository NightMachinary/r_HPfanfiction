linkffn(3155057) was a pretty interesting one where Harry time traveled back to Grindelwald's time and ended up adopting Tom Riddle and stopped him from becoming a power hungry narcissist. I believe harry goes on an undercover mission to East Europe for a mission against Grindelwald, but i won't spoil it for those that haven't read.

Errr sorry, gott edit this. I guess it might count as non-canon shipping because no one Harry's real age is there, but romance is not the focus of the story at all. Apologies. Most of the other pairings on the fic mirror canon
