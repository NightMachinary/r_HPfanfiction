Juvenile fun. Truly great "if you don't take it seriously".

Bonus note: I noticed that stuff that's way more juvenile and hard to take seriously gets taken seriously by many people here. Examples: Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches or For Love of Magic. I guess Lie being old news makes it easy to write down.
