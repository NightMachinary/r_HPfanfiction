/Little Hangleton graveyard, June 1995/

“Avada Kedavra!”

Once again, the reborn Dark Lord sent a Killing Curse towards the Boy-Who-Lived; once again, it was dodged. The boy's stamina, it seemed, was truly impressive: since Voldemort had him untied from the statue so that they could have a proper duel, Harry Potter has never stopped moving, not even for one second, and not a single one of the Dark Lord's spells found its mark.

No matter, though. Because the boy also never picked up his wand, nor casted a single spell. He was no squib, Voldemort knew that for certain -- so why didn't Potter use any magic?

“Is this truly the Boy-Who-Lived, the hope of the Light?” Voldemort jeered, casting yet another curse. “Did Dumbledore teach you nothing at all? Running won't save you, Harry -- nor will brawling like a mere Muggle. Now stop this foolishness and fight me like a proper wizard!”

Inwardly, the Dark wizard frowned. Yes, Harry Potter fought like a Muggle -- but it was much more effective than he thought was possible. Nor was the boy limited to defending himself: in fact, his lighting-fast kicks and punches have already taken out about a half of his Death Eaters.

/‘How weak have they grown without their Lord,'/ Voldemort thought irritably. ‘/I'll punish them after I'm done with--'/

Suddenly, a Patronus appeared above the cemetery. And not just any Patronus ­-- no, the silver phoenix could only belong to the one wizard Voldemort never wanted to face. The Dark wizard paused, waiting for what would come next.

“HARRY!” Dumbledore's calm voice came from within the phoenix. “REMOVE YOUR WEIGHTS!”

“Right!” the boy answered, quickly taking the weights off his legs -- and why would he wear those things to begin with? -- and throwing them to the ground from the statue on which he currently stood.

“You fool,” Voldemort said softly. “Do you truly think that some measly weights will--”

*BOOM!*

The weights made a deafening noise as they hit the ground, and then the Boy-Who-Lived looked straight at his opponent and grinned.

“All right, now I can move easily,” he said, and then raised his voice. “FEEL THE FLAMES OF YOUTH, VOLDEMORT!”

Suddenly, Harry Potter disappeared.

And then the Dark Lord knew only pain.
