I would have him show up to the ministry earlier and have him completely curb stomp every member of the order.

then Dumbledore shows up and manages to drive him away Dumbledore would reveal that he is weaker then he was during the first war.

Voldemort should be shown as a force of nature. He is a terrifying opponent and basically if he is after you then your fucked. instead of Bellatrix killing Sirius perhaps its Voldemort.

you could also explore the fact Voldemort's personality is different after his rebirth.

with Dumbledore remarking stuff like ''you where never one to play with your food tom, and yet you decided to torture harry before killing him'.

you could also have Voldemort show moments where he is the insanely charming person he used to be and give a fear that he will be back to full power eventually as he recovers from his rebirth
