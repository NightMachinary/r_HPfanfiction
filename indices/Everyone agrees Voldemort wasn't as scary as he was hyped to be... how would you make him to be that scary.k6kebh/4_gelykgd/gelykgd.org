I would make Voldemort saner. He came back and he seems more “human” than ever. However he also learnt from his mistakes. His time spend wandering as a soulless horcrux didn't make him crazy and reckless. It instead made him ruthless. He infiltrated the ministry. He keeps his initial attack on the magicals on the down low. So just like in book 5 there's a false sense of security in magical Britain. However he has given his death eaters free range on attacking muggles. He only had one rule. Don't get caught.

I would also make him and the death eaters more scary by eg. Torturing humans and muggle horns and half bloods just for amusement. Not because he was mad or crazy. And then send out the tortured souls out back to their families. Their memory wiped and the victims having no clue what happened except the scars and the trauma that their body remembers.

I would make him be more attentive of the horcrux links between him and Harry. So at some point use it to make clear to Harry. That Harry can't win. Voldemort is in his mind. He is always present. Make Voldemort try to possess him multiple times. Harry slowly loses it and loses hope. Because how can you win from someone if he is always there. Steps ahead of you because he can read his mind. (This also gives more incentive for him to learn occlumency. I do want snape to try and really reach him occlumency. And later on get punished and tortured to hell by Voldemort. Wipes him mind. Send him to Harry thinking Harry is his son - obviously not. But it will mess snape up to think he had a child with dead lily. And then he gets told everything is a lie. Or breaking his mind to recover his memories is going to be messed up. Because childhood trauma)

Or other things. Such as make Voldemort do dark rituals. Forbidden rituals. Sacrifices here and there. Make him be able to drain ppls life force so he gets stronger. Temporarily. But everything has his price. After the surge he grows weaker. It takes a toll on his body. He needs to do more and more rituals and more sacrifices. The fun amusing muggle killings become a necessity.

Make all the shit he initially did for fun (psychotic fun) make him dependent on it. Eg. Just like an addiction. So whatever he does he has no choice but to do it on a bigger scale. Instead of taking over cuz of power trips. Take over cuz he needs the life force or whatever.

The initial magical ppl who thought they were safe are realizing shit. We gon die. Also death eaters are going to slowly turn sides. (And be deathly punished when caught). Because Voldemort now kills everything just to stay alive. But the good ppl never know who is good. Who is desperately. Who is just imperiod. So you can trust nobody. Or they can't trust their own minds.

People are trying to safeguard this. They have secret pass words. They have secrets Q n As. They write down their thoughts. And keeps checking these written thoughts. They check each other for memory loss, gaps. Everyone has a rememberball. Everyone tried to learn the patronus. And use it as a last pass for happy memories. If they cannot do a patronus changes are they are effed. Paranoia at best. Also when it is really high stress and urgency. Ppl keep ppl at distance until x hours after they've seen someone drink (hello poly juice). Also every time you come into a new place you check for animagi. Nothing is easy anymore.

Magic that was once fun ... it is not anymore. Only a tool to fight abuse and self protect.
