Why do you think Voldemort didn't do many of those things, and why do you think he wasn't scary? I would be scared of a man who tortured and killed people based on their blood. Also, in the scene after Harry steals the cup, he witnesses voldemort silently spamming AK.

What is the difference between zombies and inferi to you?
