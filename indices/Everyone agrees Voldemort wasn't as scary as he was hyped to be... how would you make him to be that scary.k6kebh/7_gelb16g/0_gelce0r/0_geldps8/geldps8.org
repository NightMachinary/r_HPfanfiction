It is suggested /only once/ in the harry potter fandom wiki that if the inferi at the lake dragged you down into the water, you would become another inferius. Also, when Harry is being drowned there, he thinks "he would be drowned, and become one more dead guardian of a fragment of Voldemort's shattered soul...." But, Harry doesn't know much about inferi so he could be mistaken. So there are some clues that suggest the victims of inferi can become inferi but it's not ironclad.

But yeah, I dont know either. I think you're probably right, but in general it doesn't have a confirmed answer
