1) Eliminate idiot plots. No goddamn million moving parts script so kids can beat him. No stupid "torture my own followers" bullshit. He's absolutely fantastic to those who choose to follow him. After all, willing followers produce good results. A simple loyalty oath not to betray him or his goals is all you need to be on his good side, where he makes sure that you're in the best spot possible. He's a benevolent dictator ramped to eleven. The fight against him is based in people not wanting an immortal dictator, not in wanton massacres.

2) He's an unparalleled master of mind magic. He uses it. His forces avoid killing where possible. After all, corpses can't appreciate what he's doing for their benefit. People just... vanish. Then they come back a few days later, perfectly fine and healthy sleeper agents.

3) The Taboo is an absurd idea for a benevolent dictator. Also for a normal dictator, who creates a name then bans people from using it? (Side note: FUCKING EXPLAIN TO CHILDREN THAT A TABOO EXISTS. HARRY POTTER USING THE NAME LOOKS LIKE A TWAT BECAUSE THAT USED TO MEAN DEATH FOR EVERYONE! Anyways.) Instead, minor alterations to the magic make joking about his name and title feel like someone's walking on your grave. An incentive to treat your future king with respect, if you will. (There's an idea. That part of the magic still exists, and Harry doesn't know because the horcrux makes him immune. People are curious how he stomachs the instinctive fear response every time.)

4) No Dark Mark. He's running a guerilla war by clearly and permanently labeling his soldiers. The only reason he had loyal supporters left is because the ministry is even more of an incompitence clown fiesta than he is. Fascist regimes don't name their troops "Death Eaters" and run around with skull logos.

5) A dedicated propaganda campaign. Again, he's not Evil McEvilFace.

In short, Tom is a political figure where nobody can tell if the people around him are loyal supporters, controlled slaves, sleeper agents, or not his. The Order keeps running into prisoners booby-trapped with mind magic bombs to fry the brains of whoever's making sure they're clean.
