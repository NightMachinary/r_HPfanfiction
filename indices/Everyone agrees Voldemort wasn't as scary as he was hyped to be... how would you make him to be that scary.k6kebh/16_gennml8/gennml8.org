Actually make the Adults competent, but STILL lose, so Harry actually does require a "Power the Dark Lord Knows Not" Rather than "Wand wasn't yours it was mine because I conveniently disarmed Malfoy earlier GG" he actually NEEDS a special power to stand a chance. Because the adults being incompetent idiots so the children can be the heroes is the point. If the Adults were hypercompetent, did everything perfectly, and things STILL went to hell... things would have been a lot scarier.

Also, kill Hermione. Book 7 is "Hermione Granger dragging two idiots around" and if Hermione dies (is tortured for Information but refuses to break so is killed and her body dumped in front of Harry during Halloween of 6th year, causing Harry to flip out and awaken a power, and instead of Dumbledore being "Oh, view these memories we could totally view in a day over the whole year" he does it in a day, and actually teaches Harry, but it's not enough, and Harry scrapes a win out of a bloody and brutal battle by sheer fucking luck, even with the "Power the Dark Lord Knows Not"
