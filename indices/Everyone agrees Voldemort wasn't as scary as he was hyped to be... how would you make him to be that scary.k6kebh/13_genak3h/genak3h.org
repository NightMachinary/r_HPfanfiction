More failures? Not in the sense of making Voldemort an idiot, but having more of his plots exposed.\\
More attempts on Harry's life ala Book 1 Quidditch Match, more offscreen encounters, more plots going on in the background, numerous schemes being discovered and foiled...all building up to The One That Worked.\\
Don't just rely on one possessed girl in Chamber of Secrets, use blackmailed students, use Imperius, use a bunch of other magical creatures to blur the evidence. Don't just set up a convoluted plot to turn the Triwizard Cup into a portkey, start with using the Goblet of Fire to trap Harry in a magically binding contract then launch scheme after scheme to kidnap him while he's pinned down.\\
Thus, rather than each failure ruining Voldemort's plan and making him look like an idiot, each foiled plan is barely a speedbump, breeding a sense of paranoia that he's around every corner, that he only has to be lucky once.
