The most impressive display of magic is likely the fight with Dumbledore, like you say - although perhaps it could be argued his instinctive use of magic (before knowing that it was real) could be said to be the case, or horcruxes. But in terms of what the reader sees, the battle with Dumbledore takes center stage... it's just not amazingly impressive, at least for me.

Having him be far more competent is the approach I'd take, for sure - just like I'd give him more competent adversaries, as I mentioned. On my end, I'd prefer to have an older Harry (& Co) be the ones to look at things - so less 1st or 2nd year, more 4-7th+. But I know others disagree with that!

In terms of the 'Golden Trio' working together, it's an approach I quite like - the three main characters all having their own strengths and weaknesses, all combining to be able to plan out - and execute - a smart setup to defeat a stronger foe? Wonderful. Unfortunately I've found very few stories that execute that well - I tend to only stumble across some that do Harry + one of Hermione or Ron, instead of both :|
