the most impressive magic he did in canon was probably when he traded blows with Albus right?

But i feel like for Riddle to be more dangerous, he needs to be far more competent, but for that to happen you will also need pepole that oppose him that show competence aswell, what we get in the first books shows why that isnt possible eg mirror in first year, chamber in 2nd with the Basilisk or 3rd with Sirius and Peter. Had the adults been a bit more competent, had Remus not been a complete and utter coward, most of the books wouldnt be what they are.

I would also have Harry and Ron show more promise, eg Harry being capable of doing some high end magic, but he will need decades to catch up with the giants that are Albus and Riddle, Ron would get into the strategical side of the war, show him plotting the plans with Harry being the wand, Hermione being the knowledge and Ron applying all the factors.

Have the golden trio be more independent, but when they work together they punch out of their weight class.
