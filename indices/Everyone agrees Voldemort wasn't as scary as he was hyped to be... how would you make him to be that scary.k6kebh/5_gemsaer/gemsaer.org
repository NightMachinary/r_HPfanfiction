There are two ways to make him seem scary. One option is competence - making him smarter, more magically powerful (in a way that's impressive and visible), etc. For that option, if the Ministry and the Order are also made to be more competent, it'd be ideal. This version of Voldemort would be much more able to take control of the Ministry and its resources through his own competence, rather than their incompetence. He'd be able to outsmart the good ideas the heros might have against him, and when he shows up in person, he's easily able to sway magical combat in an impressive way.

An alternative path is to have him be more brutal - treat him more like a horror story villain, more willing to do dark magic in a way that shows why it's called /dark/ in the first place. This is the path that canon generally went, in my opinion - but with poor execution. So just do that, but with /good/ execution ;) . But that's tough to execute without falling into 'edgy' territory, of course.

My preference is the former - the same way that I also prefer smarter rest of the world. It also has more flexibility, in terms of /what/ Voldemort can be up to in the story. He can be competent through charisma, through magical strength, through researching and inventing new spells/magics, etc - and focusing on different aspects of that can come up with various interesting opportunities.

Another way to think about it is to show what canon just tells. Canon tells us that he's brilliant, charismatic, incredibly powerful. But what it shows us is a half-mad character with no real charisma, only ruling through scaring the sane ones in his inner circle and letting the insane ones run amok. It shows us someone with terrible, dumb plans, that succeed only through luck and incompetence of those opposed to him. It shows us some unique magical aspects (eg, Horcrux), but in ways that aren't honestly that impressive (ie, what's the most impressive magical feat we see Voldemort accomplish in canon?).

Also, the method for defeating him should be interesting as well - and, imo ideally, utilize multiple people. That is to say, if he gets defeated by something deus ex machina-y, through something that seems easy, or through rapid training that seemingly anyone can do, he's going to retroactively not seem like a threat. This is another easy pitfall to fall into - especially with super-Harry stories.
