To make Voldemort more scary you'll have to make him less stupid (because he's an imbecile), but that would require changing almost all aspects of canon. For example: Harry survives and Dumbledore can only keep up with Voldemort because they're all playing checkers instead of chess. Not much of the canon story-line could remain in that case and you'd basically rewrite everything (not everyone likes it, but that's what Methods of Rationality did, which has a *scary* Voldemort).

The worldbuiling in canon is fine. There's more than enough scary spells and Voldemort is shown and known to be extremely competent with those. He's just a big idiot/insane.
