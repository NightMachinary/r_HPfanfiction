Have him infiltrate the government and turn it into a monarchy, have him reveal magic to the entire juggle world and proceed to publicly torture and kill anyone who stands in his way. Don't give him close followers, all his followers should only have loyalty out of fear, which not only brings more depth and humanity to his followers but bring more character motivations. Have Voldemort be genuinely insane on all levels, no crime uncommitted, no stone unturned. He must be significantly more powerful than any witch or wizard in existence, the fact that harry overpowered him in the final moments in canon while reasonable because all horcruxes were destroyed shouldn't have happened. The only way you should be able to kill voldemort is by a numbers advantage in the thousands, his followers should be around the power they are in Canon only to emphasize how much more powerful he is than you. Overall just make him smarter and stronger then he would become the total psychopathic overlord we all want him to be.
