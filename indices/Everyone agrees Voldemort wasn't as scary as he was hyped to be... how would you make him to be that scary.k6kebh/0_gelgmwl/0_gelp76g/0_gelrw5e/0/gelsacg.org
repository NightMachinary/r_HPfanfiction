I disagree, someone who is capable of being friendly to his supporters laughing and bantering them them. and then turning around to completely slaughter his enemies like they are not even human is way more terrifying.

you could have him only care about his inner Circle. everyone else is expendable.

most people base villians off of hitler but seeing clips of hitler laughing with his friends makes it way way more chilling.

A voldemort who is able to laugh and have a genuine comradery with his followers. while at the same time torturing someone for opposing him would be far more scary
