Imagine the world where everything is the same, but Voldemort cares.

Imagine, Lucius knows exactly what the diary is and keeps it hidden, because he would give everything for his benevolent master.

Imagine Wormtail turning against the Potters not out of fear, but because he truly believes that betraying his friends is a necessary sacrifice for peace with Voldemort as the ruler of Britain. Imagine that Voldemort genuinely cares about Severus' love for Lily, and simply sends her away with a Portkey instead of killing her, and only James and Harry die that night. Imagine that Severus is still a spy after â€˜he attacked Lily's family!', but he's actually on Voldemort's side, feeding the light misinformation.

Imagine Death Eaters coming home and raving to their families about how just and kind Voldemort is, how he solved their financial struggles and kept them safe, and imagine the children and their friends raised under the belief that they owe Voldemort their lives and freedom.

Imagine that half of Hogwarts' staff and student body are comprised of traitors, and they are brought up with Voldemort's beliefs. The ministry is firmly under Death Eater control, and Lucius is voted in as Minister. There is no saviour of the wizarding world, Voldemort is never reduced to a wraith, and muggles are destroyed outright.

And nobody does anything about it, because Voldemort cared.
