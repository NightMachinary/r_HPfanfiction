I'd make him infiltrate the Ministry sooner. I like the way Lupin or Sirius described the First War with Voldemort:

#+begin_quote
  "/Imagine that Voldemort's powerful/ now/. You don't know who his supporters are, you don't know who's working for him and who isn't; you know he can control people so that they do terrible things without being able to stop themselves. You're scared for yourself, and your family, and your friends. Every week, news comes of more deaths, more disappearances, more torturing... The Ministry of Magic's in disarray, they don't know what to do, they're trying to keep everything hidden from the Muggles, but meanwhile, Muggles are dying too. Terror everywhere... panic... confusion... that's how it used to be./"

In canon that didn't really happen. We know most of Death Eaters by name, and we don't really hear of people betraying their friends or being under Imperius (and when they are, the good guys know about it).

Also, the fact that Arthur and Bill Weasley went to work when Voldemort had full power over the Ministry and Ginny went to Hogwarts when it was under Voldemort's control just doesn't make any sense.

So I'd go for that - the confusion who is who. Sure, there are some who are loyal to Voldemort and it's common knowledge, but I would add a bunch of new people (some close to Harry and the Order), I'd make him get more control over the Ministry day by day but in a sneaky way and not "magic is might. Let's make a registry for muggleborns and accuse them of stealing magic". His actions should have forced changes - the Weasleys should have gone into hiding much earlier, the same with Longbottoms and other families connected with the Order.

He would be a better villain if we were shown more of his charming, manipulative side. Most of the time he appears in the books after he gets back his body, he seems like a crazy guy obsessed with a teenage boy.

The same with Death Eaters. I think it would be better if they were more like Snape or Narcissa, who weren't brawny but brainy. Instead, most of his followers seem almost incompetent and remind me a lot about overgrown children fighting for daddy's attention.
