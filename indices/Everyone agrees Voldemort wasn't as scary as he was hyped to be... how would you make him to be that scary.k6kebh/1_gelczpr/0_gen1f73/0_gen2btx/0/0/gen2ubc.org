It's hard to write a character as competent if kids are supposed to be the heroes. Dumbledore suffers from the same problem. Still, she could've had Voldemort be the threat in the background (battling Dumbledore in a chessgame of moves and countermoves) and have the trio deal with lesser threats as the main plot, until the final confrontation.
