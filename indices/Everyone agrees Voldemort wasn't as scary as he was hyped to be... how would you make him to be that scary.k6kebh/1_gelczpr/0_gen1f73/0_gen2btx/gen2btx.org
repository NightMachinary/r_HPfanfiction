The problem is that Voldemort never shows anything like cunning. His plans are shit, he relies on brute force and that his enemies are even dumber (flight of the 7 Potters, anyone?). When I write Voldemort, I usually attempt to make him a smart enemy. Someone who will not just outfight but outthink you. Who will make plans that further his goals even if they fail. Not a guy betting everything on a Hail Mary shot like canon Voldemort did in GoF and OotP (and, arguably, in HBP and DH as well).
