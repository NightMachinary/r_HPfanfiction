I think the scariest take on Voldemort is one I read a while back where it's clear that he's just a mask.

He's a shell identity the ruthless and cold but academically brilliant half-blood Tom Riddle uses to manipulate the crazier purebloods to do his bidding in the name of 'blood purity'. His true opinion of the magical world is one of utter contempt.

He doesn't actually /care/ about any of the things his followers think are important to him. He just wants them to keep magical society in Britain off balance so no one, especially not Dumbledore or the Unspeakables, looks closely enough to realize what he's really up to.

When it comes to Harry Potter? Just make him an offer at the end of the Triwizard instead of killing Cedric. He and his friends can leave Britain, perhaps even with a substantial sum of money to set themselves up somewhere less bigoted. God knows he doesn't have any real roots there. Riddle won't follow him, or bear a grudge, after all they already traded a life for a life. He can just walk away, and Tom will kill all of the Death Eaters who were dumb enough to take his mark, even send Pettigrew's corpse back, or one transfigured into Voldemort's form in exchange for the two of them going their separate ways.

More Moriarty than Jack the Ripper.
