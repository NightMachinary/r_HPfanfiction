Making him some crazy powerful dude won't change much as that doesn't really change much. He was a sociopathic killer who enjoyed torturing people. Making him more powerful, increasing the power of his spells and stuff won't make him scarier. What /would/ make him scarier would be increasing *personal* stakes. A zombie plague would have to affect someone close to the main characters, a dark mark imperius would have to affect Ron's dad or Hermione's parents. The consequences of his actions must be closer and more personal to us.
