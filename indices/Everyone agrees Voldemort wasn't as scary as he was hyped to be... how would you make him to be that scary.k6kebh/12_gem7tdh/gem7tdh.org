I'm not sure I want to make Voldemort more powerful if I'm honest. I've seen enough anime to realize that the more powerful the enemy the more powerful your hero needs to be and it gets out of control quickly, I'm looking at you dragonball. Voldemort is a useful antagonist, but the story is about Harry Potter. If I wanted to make him more interesting I would add some lateral thinking. More politicking (perhaps the dark faction never gave up), more tactics inspired by muggles, more operations outside Britain even if it's just logistics.
