And of the other characters who are actually diverse... they're not really very good characters.

I personally like Cho, Kingsley and Angelina. I think they stand out well enough and they do deserve more love by the fandom. But everyone else feels really one note at best.

I barely remember Dean, and that's mostly with him being attached to Seamus. He doesn't really stand out as his own character with his own wants and desires beyond: I like football and I dated Ginny.

Lee is pure comic relief, yes it was a nice callback to have him over the wireless during DH, but it really just cemented him as "the guy over the microphone" who's friends with the Twins and has a pet tarantula (at some point).

Everyone else is even more forgettable:

- Blaise Zabini is only interesting because he got the Daphne Greengrass treatment (on that the fandom had to create his character for him as canon didn't give a rats ass about him before or after the meeting with Slughorn).

- Alicia Spinnet is a complete non-entity.

- What has Su Li ever done?

- As much as I like her, Cho was propped up as a crush in one book then written off as a teary mess that Harry didn't have time for in the next.

- Again, I personally like Kingsley, but (like Blaise) this is because fandom has fleshed him out. He was kinda just... there in the books, standing around looking/sounding cool.

- Who else even is there?!
