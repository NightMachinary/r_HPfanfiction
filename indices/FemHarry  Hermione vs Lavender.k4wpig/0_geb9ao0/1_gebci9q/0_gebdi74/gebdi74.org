Dude, Dean is a halfblood who thinks he is a muggleborn because his father ran away to save his family in the first war, and died there. We don't know if Dean ever found out that and could make some good fic.

Won't argue about the others but Cho is actually a good character to explore on the whole Diggory thing. She has more than a few things to explore.

You're missing the Parvati twins, There's a jew wizard in Ravenclaw and aside from that more blank slates.

I think the problem is the same Percy Jackson got in its first series (Charles Beckendorf anybody? Black dude who dies first and had the potential to be more than a background dude). Though, seems the author overcompensated for diversity in following books.
