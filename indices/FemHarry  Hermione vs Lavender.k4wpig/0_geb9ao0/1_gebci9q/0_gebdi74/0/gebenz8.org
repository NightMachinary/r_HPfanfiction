Genuinely forgot the Patil twins, thank you.

The issue, I think, is that they don't really have much in terms of their own individuality. Blank slates are fun and all, but fanfiction is about taking what is already there and morphing it into something else. E.g: Dean has a BACKSTORY in regards to his dad, but he doesn't have his own story/arc through the series. He's a side character, window dressing. Like it or not, he exists to fill out the register in class and give the main cast someone to talk about/mention every once in a while. Backstory doesn't equal character.

Blank slate characters are basically OC's and it's both difficult to write a whole new character and their interactions with the story and cast (especially if you want them to be good) but also most people just aren't interested. Less to do with their race and more due to lack of familiarity (think Sophie Roper or Lisa Turpin, not very popular are they?)

And I agree with Cho, though she does tend to be typecast into depressing stories involving Cedric as her character really does revolve around him, which is unfortunate.
