  Marietta was dealing with a no-win situation where she either betrays her friends or Umbridge goes after her family.
#+end_quote

She was never threatened at all in canon. She went to Umbridge of her own volition and told her to go to the Room of Requirement since they held meetings there.

After she saw that the jinx activated, she refused to say anything else. If she was being threatened by Umbridge, why would she refuse to say anything else about the DA after she got jinxed? Wouldn't that mean she was endangering her family?

This theory that Marietta is actually innocent is so stupid (no offense). She knew the torture that Umbridge was putting people through. She knew that Umbridge would punish the DA (which included her /friends/) extremely harshly for their disobedience. She knew everything, but she chose to do it. She wasn't ever threatened or anything like that. She betrayed them because she wanted to.
