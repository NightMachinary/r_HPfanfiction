Hagrid participated in the illegal dragon trade of his own free will, regardless of the fact that he had no long-term way of caring for said dragon. Harry was entirely fine with this. Or when Hagrid repaid Harry's willingness to break laws for him by sending Harry after something that murders unicorns alone. A dog isn't exactly a deterrent for something that murders much larger, more dangerous animals. Or that time when Hagrid knowingly told Harry and Ron to walk to their deaths, when they were saved by a literary and literal deus ex machina. After all of that, Harry is entirely fine with Hagrid.

Marietta was dealing with a no-win situation where she either betrays her friends or Umbridge goes after her family. This betrayal merits permanent scarring and shunning by her friends. Yes. Coercion is much worse than Hagrid regularly risking Harry's life.

In fairness to Harry, he's an abused child who has been regularly encouraged that acting out is a valid threat response. He's not making completely rational decisions. But that's the unwritten tragedy, isn't it? Harry desperately needs help, but nobody cares about the psychological damage inflicted on their child hero/soldier.
