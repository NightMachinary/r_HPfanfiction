Side honest question: why the fixation with Indian Harry/Potters?

I get people try to put more diversity in this british school (though it already seemed like canon had a good representation of uk population, the problem was not that there weren't diverse characters, but that they were all background)... That aside, why Indian? I mean almost all the race change to Harry are to Indian, why not Chinese? Or New Zealand? Or Mexican? Or Madagascar penguin? Is there something in canon that specially points to the possibility not Indian?

Honest doubt there.

The Potter surname always felt uk native to me... And don't remember indications of Lily being Indian or James for that matter.

It would be cool to have more fics around people who are actually these races. They get sidelined a lot. Where's my Dean Thomas series? Or Lee Jordan? Or Some Chang or Shafiq or whatever...
