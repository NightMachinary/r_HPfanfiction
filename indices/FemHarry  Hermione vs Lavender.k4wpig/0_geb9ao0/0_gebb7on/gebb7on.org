I think the reason Indian Potter's is so popular is because it is one of the most plausible race changes for Harry.

For me personally, I like the idea of Harry's grandmother being an Indian woman, thus making James mixed race and so on. I think the Indian setting works so well as the British Raj was still a thing back when James's parents were young so it is feasible that Fleamont Potter (a successful businessman who sold his company) could feasibly have done business there. And though Euphemia doesn't stand out as a traditional Indian name (as far as I'm aware) we know literally nothing about her, so it's easy to give her something, just like the fandom did with Daphne Greengrass.

Additionally, making Harry of Indian descent doesn't really change much, but it does add to his character in certain contexts (especially if you take it in AU directions). For me personally, it's easier to understand why a neighbourhood of, presumably, middle-upper class white families would arbitrarily label Harry Potter (a quiet, sweetheart who only wore clothes that didn't fit him and was constantly bullied by the other kids) as a troublemaker and ignore his plight if he was a little brown boy in a place where that wasn't quite so common in the 80's.

It's a harmless change to Harry that allows writers to explore something different about a pre-established character without breaking them off from what they are. Being Indian doesn't change anything about Harry's personality or motivations, but can give different angles to approach his story and a new, fresh lense to discuss his character (as Hermione being black does too) whilst also being somewhat plausible.
