I get why they do it, though it felt weird it was always indian. Why not Greek? Euphemia's name is greek, I think... or middle eastern? Or something in between? Turkish seems feasible.

Anyhow, whatever race you make Harry it needs to be more than a grandmother. Otherwise Harry is not a brown kid. If you have Euphemia Indian but Fleamont and both of Lily's parents white... Harry's brown skin may be barely noticeable and could pass as "lightly tanned" or something.
