If you wanna do it that way, it would be super interesting. I personally roll with the Indian headcanon with Euphemia being Indian but I only speak for myself there (as even then, Harry's not going to be white).

You'd have to scour through somewhere like Tumblr or Twitter to find out the exact history of where it came from, as I'm just someone on the sidelines who kinda likes the idea.
