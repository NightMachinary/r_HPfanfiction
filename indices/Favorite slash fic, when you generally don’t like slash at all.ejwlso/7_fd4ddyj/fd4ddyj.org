The only slash I really dislike is Harry/Death-Eater fanfic as it's often either slightly gross (Harry trying to bang people who believe he and people like him are animals and all) or quite 'The Death-eaters did nothing wrong/Aren't as bad as everyone says' apologist fic.

The only two in that vein I've actually enjoyed are Again and Again by Athey, and that's only because the idea that Eternal Return would eventually wear you down Stockholm-Syndrome-style to care for the only person who seemed to understand what you've been through. It's Harry/Tom Riddle.

The other is Like a Ghost in My Town series by Batsutoutsai. I just find the storyline interesting enough to mostly ignore the pairing, and seeing some of the reactions and family-time interactions in the second one.
