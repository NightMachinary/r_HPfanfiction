I don't hate slash fic at all, but it perhaps does make up a smaller portion of my favorites list than not slash. I suppose Face Death In The Hope is technically slash given the pairing listed, but 53 chapters and 234k words (plus a 9 chapter, 49k word companion fic) in and there's been no slash content thus far. linkao3(5986366)

 

For fic that actually has slash content, my favorite would be Whispers in Corners. Though there is a reason that Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run still gets recced every once in a while. linkao3(1134255) linkao3(7331278)
