linkao3(House Proud by astolat) because the idea of sentinent wizard homes just enthralls me and it's incredibly well written. I also think the characters are very similar to how they are in canon.

I don't mind slash fic however, though I don't seek it out. I love that fanfic has fics for everyone.
