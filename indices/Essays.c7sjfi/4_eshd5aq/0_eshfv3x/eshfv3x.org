This is awesome!

Interesting excerpt:

"And for those who sniff and mutter yes, but that for every clever Muggle-born or known halfblood that Horace ever adopted, there were probably a dozen high-status brats with nothing to recommend them but their family names, I answer; yes. That is the whole point of the Slug Club. Those overpriveliged little puppies are the kids who really need that Club. And throughout Snape's term in the office they haven't been getting it.

Which has only made the whole situation worse.

Who else is going to teach those little “scions” the responsibilities that their place in the pecking order entails. Their families? They are only with their families for a couple of months of the year. You don't turn out any kind of a viable future “ruling class” without giving it a solid grounding in the duties of their high position, as well as the benefits."

I can very easily imagine an alternate history with all seven years of Slughorn and a divide among the slytherins between pure-blooded bigotry and self-interested desire to invest in talented muggleborns instead of the obnoxious unanimity we got in canon.
