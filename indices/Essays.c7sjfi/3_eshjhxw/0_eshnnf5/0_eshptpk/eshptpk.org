Harry can be quite mean. For example at beginning of OOTP, he was pissed at Ron and Hermione NOT writing him about what he wanted know (BIG MISCONCEPTION in the fandom: they still wrote him often, but was advised by Dumbledore not to write anything about the Order and Voldemort), so he retaliated by ordering Hedwig to peck on their hands. When they finally met, it was all caplock Harry.
