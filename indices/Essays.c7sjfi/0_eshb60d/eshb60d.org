Before the HP Wiki, there was the hp-lexicon.org, which remains a better-annotated and sourced reference to the HP canon, depending on your definition of it.

They have several [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/category/essays/][essays]] that cover a variety of arguments that have risen in the fandom over the years. One of my favorites is '[[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/2006/01/28/secrets-of-the-classlist/][Secrets of the Classlist]]'- the essayist proceeds from the assumption that JKR's original 40 classlist is meant to accurately reflect the population of the UK in the early 90's, and so allocates the regional, economic, an even the religious background of Harry's year.
