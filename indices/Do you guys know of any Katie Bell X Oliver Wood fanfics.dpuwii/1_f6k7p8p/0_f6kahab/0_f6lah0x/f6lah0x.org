Linkao3(5025334) That one is about 2k. It's not that long and you can really give it a go. I highly recommend it. I thought that it was really good. It's a little soulmate Au and for the most time it's just Wood thinking about Quidditch. Their Rivalry is very well done in this story as close to canon as you can go with that pairing. That's the fic that got me into that ship.
