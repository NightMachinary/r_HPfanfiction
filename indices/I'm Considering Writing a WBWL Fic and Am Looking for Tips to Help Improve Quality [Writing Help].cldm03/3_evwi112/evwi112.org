I enjoy WBWL trope a lot too. I've yet to find a perfect WBWL story though hah. Most of the things that I hate when reading you have listed already.

One more thing that annoys me in these stories is when Harry gets overpowered and infallible. The sibling-who-lived gets lazy and complacent but Harry gets super focused on his studies and eventually becomes crazily skilled. Up to a certain degree it is plausible but when he is a master occlumentist, a potioneer and an animagus, all at once and and in addition to being few years ahead of his peers, it becomes ridiculous. It is also tiring if Harry never fails, all his plans work as intended and he always wins over his opponents.
