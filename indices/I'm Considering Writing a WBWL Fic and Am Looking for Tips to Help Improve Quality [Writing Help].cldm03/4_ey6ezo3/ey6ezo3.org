Hi there, so, just a general word of advice from someone who has written a WBWL story that got some attention. The fans/readers you get for WBWL are a new sort, mostly because the concept and trope for WBWL is so heavily known. There will be absolutely savage flames, and you will likely (despite your best efforts) distress or infuriate a lot of your readers. I'm not trying to throw you off your game or discourage you, but it's best to mentally prepare for the rapid response and reception while writing. Aim for a percentage of reviews (60% positive) or a ratio of kudos to chapter counts if you're on AO3. Focus on the positive reviews, and ignore the flames. Accept the analytical help from people who will always emerge from the woodwork. Don't shift your plot or timeline based on how impatient people are, or no matter how much fans demand.

WBWL is a vicious genre to work in, as is most dark fics. I've talked with a few other authors of darker Harry Potter works, ones that are popular for good or bad; it's always a similar story. It's a rough start, but once you start writing and posting, remember that you're writing for yourself, not a nameless face who will always say that you are writing crap.
