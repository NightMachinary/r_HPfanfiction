  The concept of Harry Potter's parents being alive and him having a twin who is the "important one" has always snatched my interest.

Why the hell is this WBWL? "Wrong Boy Who Lived" should apply to the prophecy applies to Neville.

Maybe it is because I honestly never got the appeal of giving Harry a sibling or somehow making him alive alive parents and still suffer his relative abuse, but how the hell did that become the WBWL trope? Was there just a story that did that and everyone copied?
