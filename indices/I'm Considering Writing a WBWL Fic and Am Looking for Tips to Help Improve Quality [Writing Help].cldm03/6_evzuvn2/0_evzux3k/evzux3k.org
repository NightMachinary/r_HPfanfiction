#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was not the boy-who-lived and therefore he was not the favored child. No, his twin brother Nathan Potter was, and Nathan was easily loved by all, including by the supposedly emotionless Harry Potter himself. Harry had no time for jealousy, nor was he jealous of the brother whom he loved dearly. He would have no time for such emotions, nor would he be given the time to simply enjoy his childhood as his early youth as heir to an ancient and most noble house was spent under the guidance of cold and strict tutors whose lessons forced him to become a rather emotionally detached young man. However, perhaps his friends could help him learn what it meant to have friends that weren't his brother. And maybe, just maybe, guidance from professor Snape, and upperclassmen could help Harry become the empathetic Healer that he knew he could be.That is if he can learn to navigate and cope with his visions as a seer and not fall victim to Voldemort's ever growing obsession with him that may very well lead him to insanity.
