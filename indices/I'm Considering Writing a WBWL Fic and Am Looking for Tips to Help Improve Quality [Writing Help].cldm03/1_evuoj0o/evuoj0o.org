The best of what you're going for is, of course, Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived)

  let's say Harry befriends a Suspected Death Eater's Kid. Harry wants to bring this kid home, and his parents are adamantly against it. Even if they did think Death Eater's Kid was a good kid, they might be concerned about the parent using the kid to slip an attack in. So Harry's friends get blocked at the door, but WBWL's friends get to come right on in.

This is plausible, but only slightly. The actions of Peter (and Snape) in addition to the war /should/ make them more paranoid, but they should also be wiser. During the war, they trusted Peter implicitly /because/ the saw him as weak. They distrusted Remus because he spent his days surrounded by werewolves. As such, they should either trust their judgment or trust only a few people, which excludes the brother's friends as well. It's also pretty hypocritical and, if you do go this route, Sirius (or Remus) should point this out.

Maybe let the DE kid come over after a chat with Sirius, but have the seeds of favoritism be planted in Harry's mind still?

  bigger head than normal who can be pompous and bratty but has their heart in the right place. Think of a Duddly who isn't a bully but actually has a strong sense of justice

So, like a mix of canon Harry and Cormac/Percy? This is fine.
