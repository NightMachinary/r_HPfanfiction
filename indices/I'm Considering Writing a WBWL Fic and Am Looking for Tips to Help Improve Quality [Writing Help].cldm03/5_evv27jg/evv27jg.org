Wow, This sounds really good.

I usually despise WBWL fics but this sounds really good especially this part:

  One example, though--let's say Harry befriends a Suspected Death Eater's Kid. Harry wants to bring this kid home, and his parents are adamantly against it. Even if they did think Death Eater's Kid was a good kid, they might be concerned about the parent using the kid to slip an attack in. So Harry's friends get blocked at the door, but WBWL's friends get to come right on in. At a young age, Harry would see it as his parent's favoritism of his sibling. On James' and Lily's end, they have a tough time explaining to a young kid about these types of dangers and stuff--also, /perhaps/ they are paranoid.
