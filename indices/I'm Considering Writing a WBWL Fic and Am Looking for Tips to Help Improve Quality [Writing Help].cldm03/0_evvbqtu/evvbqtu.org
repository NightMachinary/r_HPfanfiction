I dont know why, but sometimes i just want a good WBWL fic, where Dumbledore isn't a dick, the potters are their canon good selves. Harry and his brother are close. MC is Harry, and in the end Harry kills voldemort because he is his brothers right hand man, thus forfilling the prophercy.

Why cant Wbwl fics not be good happy stories where Harry still wins, just have Potters against the world, instead of everyone against Harry?
