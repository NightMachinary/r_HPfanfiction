linkffn(Princess of the Blacks) has a very interesting premise. It does feature a manipulative Dumbledore, but it doesn't come out of nowhere. And it introduces a lot of different magics. I don't think it really fits into what you want to write, but at the same time it could be worth a read for inspiration.
