Well, conceptually, a horcrux is taking someone else's life and using it for yourself. Ending a life selfishly. The opposite of that might be giving birth, or getting pregnant. Beginning a life unselfishly.

I would expect the killing curse to work.

Something religious, especially major religious artifacts, such as the possessions of a saint or similar.

As horcruxs are meant to be like the darkest most foul thing ever you could justify something like Phoenix tears, unicorn blood, etc destroying them.

Personally I like the idea that the sun damages them over time, especially a sunrise.
