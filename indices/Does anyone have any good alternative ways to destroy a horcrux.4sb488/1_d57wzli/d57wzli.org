Any extremely destructive substance would likely do. Like, a Horcrux isn't specifically weak to Basilisk Venom, it's just that Basilisk Venom falls under a very small category of substances. There are probably some extremely caustic muggle acids that would do the job.

Alternatively, you could bring the horcrux to Mount Doom and pitch it into the lava.
