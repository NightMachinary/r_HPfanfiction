That's fine, but my head canon is that I dislike the idea of a magical thing automatically being immune to everything that is muggle. Like, wizards never getting cancer, or never catching mundane diseases, that doesn't make sense to me. The same would be said of chucking a horcrux into the sun - it should absolutely disintegrate a horcrux into oblivion, considering it likely a thousand times hotter than fiendfyre. Being a part of a nature should not preclude something to having no effect. It should not be as simple as merely filling out a checkbox.
