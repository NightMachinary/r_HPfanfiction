Ehh, I dont think everything magical is orthogonal to the mundane, but at least some forms of magic are likely to be more /conceptual/ than physical. For instance, a basic shield charm might just do something like 'absorb 1000 N of energy in the form of heat, kinetic, or magic radiation' where as a much more advanced spell would be along the lines of 'create a small inconsistency in space time such that the reality on side A of the shield is not contiguous with reality on side B of the shield'. If i was Vold, i wouldn't just make my Horcrux 'as hard as diamond', i would make it 'a fixed point in space time'. One allows mundane effects to work, the other does not; at least not until you hit frankly preposterous energy levels like a black hole by which point things have just gotten silly.

Fiendfyre is not destructive because it is particularly hot: it is a form of magic that erodes all physical matter, somewhat like a strong acid or base but more so because it is always operating at maximum potency and doesn't care for chemical properties. Magical Antimatter, if you will. Magic /is/ sometimes just 'thing A+1' but sometimes it is 'thing B', and thus not really comporable.
