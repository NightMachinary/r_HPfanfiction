My head cannon has always been that a Horcrux is essentially immune to all conventional mundane forces. Basilisk Venom is /magical/, it has, as a base property, an inimical effect on all living things, including, apparently, Horcruxes. If vold was smart he would have chucked his Horcruxes into the sun; it wouldn't have bothered them.
