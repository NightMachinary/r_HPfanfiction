Oh, totally, I'm just crowdsourcing. My idea so far stems from the fact that Neville is one of the stars of my story. Because of that, something herbology based like Essence of Devil's Snare or Concentrated Tentacula Venom would work really well for me. But there are a lot of horcruxes to destroy and I think I'm going to include an account of someone else destroying ANOTHER horcrux belonging to an entirely different villain.
