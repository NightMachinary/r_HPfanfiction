Here's some curve for your balls- were Horcruxes inherently so well defended, magically and physically, or were those protections added onto the items after their en-soul-celment? I've always thought that it was just Voldemort's fanatical paranoia in the defense of his soul-anchors, and not some super-overpowered magical immortality. Because really, if the horcrux itself is so powerful, just make a pebble into one, and chuck it in a lake.
