Unlike many other people in this thread, I don't think that horcruxes are /inherently/ immune or even resistant to damage. Harry certainly wasn't.

Rather, the resistance is the result of additional spells which are layered on top of the horcrux during and after its creation, and which could presumably be applied to other objects if necessary.

So then the question becomes about what oversights the person creating the horcrux made. It is possible to make objects resistant to fiendfyre (some parts of Hogwarts appear to be) or to basilisk venom (although goblins probably try to keep how to do that secret). There's probably even a way to make an object resistant to the killing curse - surrounding it with a shell of dead matter or a field that saps the power from spells or massively slows them down.

There will always be oversights or work-arounds for whatever precautions are taken. Voldemort's strategy was mostly about preventing people from finding his horcruxes and building in active defenses to prevent cooperation around them or subvert/kill his enemies, with a bare minimum of effort put into passive defense. This was probably the right strategy.
