I think horcruxes are the reverse of a normal person. With a person the soul is practically impervious to damage unless you do some really bad crap (spells or acts) and is sustained by the vessel. With a horcrux the vessel is practically impervious to damage but sustained by the soul. You need to do something so destructive that you damage the vessel beyond all means of repair like you must to a body to kill the person. Try dragon fire, werewolf bite, dementor's kiss, demon soul trade, convince the diary to remorse...
