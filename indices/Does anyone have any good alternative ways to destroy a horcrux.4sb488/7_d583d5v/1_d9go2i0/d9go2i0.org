The fact is, we know so little about the Veil it might not even be real. I have mused about the fact that it would be ridiculously easy for any wizard to build an archway, hang a curtain on it, and enchant it so that it ripples and produces whispers (the enchantments on a Howler would do it!). Plus, of course, vanishing whatever goes through it.
