I always thought that a neat concept would be since a Murder helped create it, saving someones life (It would have to be without planning or foreknowledge) while in close proximity to a Horcrux would destroy it.

Also I always thought that since they are still pieces of soul and technically alive in some way, tossing them through the veil should work to uh.... destroy them? This of course depends on what you view the veil as or how you think it works.
