Yea the veil has always intrigued me because you simply never know whats beyond it. Its implied to be some sort or realm of souls where the dead go, but that's just it, its only implied. I am honestly kinda surprised at how few FF stories seem to really explore the veil itself or at least utilize it as a plot starter. The Black Comedy is one of the few (decent stories) that does so and even then its only used as a plot starter.
