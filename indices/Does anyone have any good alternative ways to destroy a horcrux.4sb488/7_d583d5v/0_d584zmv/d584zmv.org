Hmm, that could be a little scary actually. What if you're wrong about the way the way the veil works? What if (for example) you think the Veil sends things to death but it actually . . . vanishes them? Could you unvanish them? Would they still work? What would you do with Voldemort if you vanished one of his horcruxes? Maybe something like they do in The Black Comedy.
