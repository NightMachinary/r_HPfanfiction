I don't think there is a clear definition of what 'Dark' and 'Light' entail. Is a Dark Wizard simply a user of Dark magic? Or does there need to be a certain ideology they subscribe to?

As to what I am? I'd lean more towards Dark, I am far more likely to follow someone who exudes power than benevolence. I'm not saying I necessarily agree with "There is no good and evil, only power and those too weak to seek it" but I do think it has merit, especially in the Wizarding World.
