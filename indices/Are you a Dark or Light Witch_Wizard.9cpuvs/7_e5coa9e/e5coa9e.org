I think it is probably a good thing that I don't have magic, because there is a part of me that would be using pretty much the entire Hogwarts curriculum in some nefarious scheme or another. It /starts/ with using arithmancy and divination to indulge in insider trading they can't touch me for...

... that said, I'm not terribly impressed with most of the 'dark' magic portrayed in canon. Most of it seems to do things you can achieve in other ways, but with added atrocity, apparently purely for shits and giggles.
