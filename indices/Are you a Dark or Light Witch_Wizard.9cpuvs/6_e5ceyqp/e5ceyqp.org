I despise both dark and light lords, too much Star Wars in these fanon cliches.

But if I have to pick one, definitely “dark lord” because “light lord” sounds totally ridiculous.

I may not use any Unforgivables, but that doesn't mean I would not develop aerosolized basilisk venom and saturate bomb Malfoy Manor with this stuff.
