I'd make explicit that all of this applies to the protagonist /and/ the antagonist.

The opposition figure needs the same care and making sure their sheet is incompatible in parts with the protagonist.

Peril is what makes a story interesting, and a cartoon villain that exists solely to let the protagonist show how clever they are isn't enough to really make a reader think they might win.

And an antagonist with no chance of winning is no antagonist at all.

(I'd also quibble about the shoe-horning in characters issue. The problem only arises when you fail to revise your character to make them fit the new plot you've put them in.

Admittedly, it's not as efficient as knowing where you're going from the start, but sometimes I find that having a starting point sparks more interesting options to take. As long as you remove the false-starts, no-one should ever know.)
