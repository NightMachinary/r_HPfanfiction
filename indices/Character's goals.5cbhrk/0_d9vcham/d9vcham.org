Thank you very much for the excellent post. It reminds me of one of my favourite Vonnegut quotes:

#+begin_quote
  “Make your characters want something right away even if it's only a glass of water. Characters paralyzed by the meaninglessness of modern life still have to drink water from time to time.”
#+end_quote

Your final point is great advice.

#+begin_quote
  How do you make a story interesting? By creating a starting point with his need, making them conflict with his desire and making your charactor decide on a path to follow based on his value in order to accomplish his ambition. To do so, he must resolve the goal, which is only a concrete, defined form of his ambition based on values + desire.

I wholeheartedly agree with this and believe that most fanfic authors fail to assign any meaningful ambitions to their protagonists other than 'falling in twoo wuv with their Soul Bond mate,' 'escape manipulations,' or 'become a badass through a last minute deus ex machina.' This results in thin characterisations which drag down even the most engaging plots. Even if authors manage to impart a nebulous desire to 'survive encounter with Voldemort' or 'change the magical world for the better,' they often fail to tie that ambition into the character's immediate thought processes or desires.

I have a question for you: do you think there is any 'best' method (e.g. dialogue, narration, or description) to accomplish this in third-person limited stories where the reader is somewhat separated from the protagonist's mindset (compared to first-person)?
