Most people have a fear of death, but to the point of splitting your soul?

I'd qualify voldemort's as a literal phobia, as his boggart would be his death self. In that sense, I think therein lies more substance and reasons behind his fear than any other average individuals.

He made it a literal obsession and goes way further than normal. So, in that case, one must stop and think about what lies in death that makes him so scared, because it goes much MUCH further than simply being scared of dying.
