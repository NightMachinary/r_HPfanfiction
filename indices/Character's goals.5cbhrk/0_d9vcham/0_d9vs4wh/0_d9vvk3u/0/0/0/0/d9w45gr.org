mhm, and that's why i think it's interesting and fitting that harry associates voldemort's movements with that of a child at the end of DH, and that he's stuck as a monstrous foetus in limbo for eternity. voldemort was, ultimately, a creepy manchild. i likened him to littlefinger and walter white in the other thread and i think the comparison holds up- he has a colossal ego that perpetually needs feeding, and the idea that he's considered anything but the Greatest gnaws at his soul
