I would argue that his main drive is the desire to be known, and not just known, but respected by all. He started out life as an orphan, not having anyone to hold him or love him, no friends to get along with or learn social cues from.

He wants what any kid wants: Attention.

Coming from a place completely devoid of attention that wasn't negative, he wanted attention, and that attention to be positive. In the orphanage it seemed he was not given any positive attention, no friends, just fellow orphans, during WW2. Ultimate goal in that environment: Survive.

After a decade of that, he is told that he is special, he Belongs, he belongs to a Group, a group of people who can do what ever they want because they are special.
