I don't actually think that a desire for recognition lies behind Voldemort's fear of death. Most people are afraid of death; they just come to terms with it eventually. They're afraid of vanishing from existence. Sure, some people might strive to do great deeds so their name lives on, but that's a paltry form of immortality and no real substitute for everlasting life.

I agree that Voldemort wants his name on everyone's lips, but I don't think that drives his primal fear of death.
