Okay, I'm seated with a laptop, so I considered elaborating my explanation with Voldemort (only because it's the character I most understand, as I spent a lot of time analyzing him.).

So we have our Voldemort, Megalomaniac, psychopath, narcissistic dark lord.

What is his long term goal?\\
Immortality. I don't think anyone will deny that, every action he ensure in his last arc of existence and previously with the creation of his horcruxes. But it wasn't always the case, wasn't it? He did not happened into world thinking, I am /so/ going to be immortal, you watch it.

What other goals did he have?\\
Stealing and harming people in the orphanage.\\
Becoming a teacher\\
Getting the Thestral wand\\
Opening the chamber of secret\\
Making his horcruxes\\
Fooling teachers and students by being charming outstanding. Learning about Dark Arts.\\
Vanquishing Dumbledore\\
Vanquishing Harry Potter\\
Controlling the Wizarding World\\
And others...

So if we put them in order we have the following: Stealing and harming people in the orphanage, Fooling teachers and students by being charming and outstanding Learning about Dark Arts. Opening the chamber of secrets\\
Making his horcruxes\\
Becoming DADA teachers\\
Controlling the Wizarding World,\\
Vanquishing Dumbledore\\
Vanquishing Harry Potter,\\
Getting the Elder wand.

Many of these overlaps, and the all-encompassing immortality only becomes clear when he started making horcruxes. Does that mean he did not want to be immortal before then? no, but it was not his goal. It was more abstract, an /ambition/

What ambition? What is the common point behind all of these goals. Fame?\\
Our first thought my be this, but it does not quite add up. Fame is not everlasting, it's short, fleeting. Which contradicts with his immortality. If he wanted fame, why would he care about Immortality?

Power? Again, if power was what he wanted, why seek Immortality? To make a point? Wouldn't just making his goal of vanquishing Dumbledore and getting the Elder Wand be the culmining point of this ambition?

Family?\\
Yeah let's not got there.

So what abstract concept did Voldemort seek through his life goals? What did he hope to gain by bullying, murdering, maiming, learning all those spells and trying to kill muggles and take over the Wizarding World? What did he want to be? He wanted to be different, he wanted to be better than others. Most importantly, he wanted to be recognized as someone different and better (hence why he did not keep his father's name, why he only seeked famous objects for his horcruxes, why he wanted to be a teacher). So his ambition behind his goal would be recognition, that is what he seeks to accomplish throughout all his life, by trying different goals. Recognition.

We have his ultimate goal: Immortality We have his ambition behind his goal: Recognition. We have the need behind his ambition: Esteem. We also established his desire: To be different, to be better.

Okay, now we have that, how does he go about getting it: He usually goes by putting himself above others, he is a man who does not hesitate in sacrificing everyone to achieve his goal, or to use people to get what he wants.\\
He manipulates, cheats, lies, but also seeks knowledge and works very hard to achieve. What does that say about values?

Lying, cheating, selfishness, greed, determination, ruthlessness, knowledge, hard-working, authority.

Voldemort's desire does not work against his need, but his perception of his reality, based on his knowledge and evolution will affect the range and reach of his goal. One of the most effective filter of this reality are emotions. The whole spectrum range of feelings, and are also how an author will show how the character approach and progress in his story.\\
How did he get from bullying, or teaching, to immortality? By experiencing and feeling things.

And there is one particular feeling that Voldemort experienced throughout his life, and that Dumbledore took great time in repeating: Fear.\\
Voldemort is afraid. That's one of the main feelings we need to focus here.

What is he afraid of? Death. He is utterly frightened by death, but what in death scares him?\\
The same thing that makes him want pursue recognition rather than fame. Death, to him, implies forgetting. Voldemort, through his disorder, does not comprehend human emotions, he does not comprehend that love can exist outside of physical visibility, hence why he constantly need his Death Eater to prove themselves to him, to prostrate to him, because he does not understand that emotions goes further than a fleeting moment. So by dying, Voldemort is afraid of being forgotten.\\
Death is the utmost representation of his failure at accomplishing his need. He tries to circumvent that by achieving immortality.

To summarize (OR TL;DR because why not): The starting point of Voldemort is his esteem need. This do not conflict with his desire to be better or different, but the latter rather act as a fuel through which he act in accord with his values, eventually defining his ambition of being recognized. Yet, Rowling makes a strong emphasize upon his fear of death, and through a mix of all that, Voldemort arrive at the conclusion that his ambition can only be fulfilled through immortality.

How does Rowlin goes about expressing these points? She never explicitely states his need, or his ambition. She does emphasize his goal, but mostly put her focus upon his desire to be better and different, his values, in how he acts, and his feelings, to construct our view of the character.
