I think that most of the goals and ambitions you've listed aren't really the driving force of his life. What Voldemort wants is power, or more specifically, to not feel powerless. He was raised being ignored and then hated and eventually realized that he deserved better. He found ways to defeat and overwhelm his tormentors, using abilities beyond their control. Things were going swimmingly until Dumbledore showed up and tore away all his preconceptions about the control he'd achieved in his life. Here was a person who was more powerful than him, able to rob him of the security of his secrets and bringing the message that 'you are not the exception- you're just one of many in an exclusive group'.

He went to Hogwarts because his frame of reference where control was concerned had widened to include the Wizarding world and in particular, his nemesis and personal devil, Albus Dumbledore. His passion was in learning more than Dumbledore, to be more influential and otherwise dominate all who could possibly take away his power. Finding out that he was the Heir of Slytherin and therefore rare and exceptional was a vindication of his cause- he really was greater than all others, he just had to fulfill the promise of his lineage. Also, it put him in the position of wanting to exceed Slytherin's accomplishments.

The last relevant aspect of his primary passion is the one force it seemed all were powerless against: death. He had heard of ways to extend life, and he sought to find them, take them, and exceed them. Not one horcrux but seven, and with the youth and economic power of the Philosopher's stone as well, he could be greater even than Herpo the Foul, who had created these apex magics that few others had truly attained.

When the Philosopher's Stone was destroyed it frustrated him, but the fact that no one else would have it either probably helped him get over that particular loss.

Just my thoughts on the matter.
