You make fair points all around. It was exactly stories like you mentioned that prompted me to write this. People can also notice that the most popular stories are those where the goal is more defined.

As for your question, I'll try to answer to the best of my abilities.\\
Say your character's goal is to become chief warlock of the wizengamot.

Well maybe at eleven year old he'll only have the vague feeling of wanting to be powerful, but because he's evolving and malleable, shoe-horning him in the finite decision of becoming head of W wouldn't be realist or interesting. He could start by wanting to become an auror, but then realize he has no talent in duelling. Through his friend, school, talent that he will discover alongside the reader, your protagonist will slowly narrow his choice. I am good in history of magic, I have friends with connection, I am a talented speaker with charisma, but I suck at any form of magical battle. Yet I want to make an impact on the wizarding world, how can I?\\
His goal, then, could be to discover himself. How? Reading, finding summer jobs asking people, experiencing things that happens without his own prodding (external events). Why? To find myself.

Through this, with others friends, he discovers his talent finds itself in politics. So he want to go in politic. He may immediately sets the goal to become minister, as it's something any young knows and relates to. It's powerful.\\
His next goal is to get the best grade possible, he then graduate, manage to find a small job related to politics, maybe secretary or pen-pusher or something.\\
Using his connections, and talents, he can come to the realization that minister does not have so much power after all, despite being famous. But your character does not care so much about fame. He wants power. He realize that the real power is in legislation (because values that's why), who is responsible of the legislation? Wizengamot. And at the head is the chief warlock. He then realize that his goal is to become chief warlock. This should be the last arc, the completion of the ambition that was vaguely hinted at at the start of the book. And every goals that he went through only served to push him toward his realization.

But how did Iamage to keep track and make understand the reader what my character wanted?\\
By the following.\\
First, always always keep three questions at the forefront of your mind : why, how and what. What is my character doing, or what does he hope to gain by doing this. (goal) How is he doing it. (values) Why is he doing it (motivation : need + desire)

But then, to pinpoint more precisely on your question, how can you make your reader understand that? By keeping out of his head and making your character /feel/.\\
All of what I keep hammering creates feelings. Need may create desperation, ruthlessness, restlessness. Respecting ones value create the feeling g that "this is righr" while going against them can create strong feeling of guilt, anxiety and uneasiness. Desire can be expressed through longing, wishing, hoping. Ambition is through determination.

Through narration, dialogue and description, you will express your protagonist feelings about particular things, people and actions. The more the story progress, the more completed and accomplished your character should feel, until the point where he feels complete.\\
Or dead. It happens too.

But still, story should focus on the development of your character, the way he perceive reality and how this perception changes through time and space by making him pursue a goal.

Do I answer your question? I'm on the train and I'm prone to ramble don't feel bad to say no if I didnt, I tend to lose myself in explanations on my cell.
