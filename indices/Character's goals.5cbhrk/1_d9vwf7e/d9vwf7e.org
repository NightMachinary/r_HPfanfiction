Thank you, nothing drives me crazier then stories where there is no goal, no focus. Well, baring small slice of life one shots of course. Almost as bad are stories where the character has a goal... but then does the exact opposite.

A classic example is Harry Potter in fanfiction wanting to be average, but then signing up for all the classes in the world, training every hour of every day, actively seeking out danger, and most horrendously show boating.
