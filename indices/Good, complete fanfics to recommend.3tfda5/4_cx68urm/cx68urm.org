This is quite short but very funny. Basically, after the end of canon Snape's ghost haunts Harry and Ginny, which influences how they name their children. linkffn(The Wendell that Wasn't).

Also, linkffn(3673824). I won't give too much away, but the first chapter is Snape-centric. It's useful, but not necessary, to be slightly familiar with some of Sir Terry Pratchett's Diskworld books, but it's by no means a crossover.
