you've presumably read snape chronicles

i like the snape in methods of rationality, mostly because he receives the power bump i always felt he should have. unfortunately for your question he's a tangential character, but it's the closest portrayal i've found to how i imagine snape. sort of dumbledore's man who gets things done, with gray morals and no emotions.

snape is actually the worst-written main character in all of fanfiction i think. such a shame
