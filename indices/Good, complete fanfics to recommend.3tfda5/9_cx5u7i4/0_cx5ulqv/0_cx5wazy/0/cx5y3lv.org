the life and times, shoebox project

but with snape i meant that even among the .000001 percent of fanfiction i would ever touch, otherwise decent authors still get snape wrong. see above link, the story about snape going back in time to raise harry. read the first chapter... nothing about that character is written well or accurately. and the overall quality isn't great but it's good enough for fanfiction, so i hoped for a better personalization. but snape is too hard.
