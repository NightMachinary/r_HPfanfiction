Mhm. A huge part of it is that people still can't really decide anything about him, so his portrayals just end up trying to cram him into tropes. Which is unfortunate, because I think he's one of the most interesting characters in the series, with a lot of fanfiction potential, that nobody explores in ways I agree with.
