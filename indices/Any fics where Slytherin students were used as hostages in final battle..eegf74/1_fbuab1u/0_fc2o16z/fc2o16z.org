I am absolutely a Hufflepuff. I would do that. I believe in fairness, hard work, and sticking it to the cunts hard with a half brick in a sock, from behind a pillar where they can't see me.

Fairness isn't fairness in combat. It's fairness in society, and to get that, we may have to kill a whole lot of Slytherins.
