*Harry Potter and the Power of Paranoia Linkffn(8257400)*

One of the best, really. And it fits your category perfectly.

Basically, Harry has had enough being slandered, and decides to run away to America. Story is honestly pretty great. The way Harry hides from everyone is inventive and super interesting. I love how it's done.
