I know it's just a plot device to get them together, but I highly doubt McGonagall would choose Daphne over Hermione for Head Girl. I mean, by that point she'd have already basically saved the country with Harry and Ron, while Daphne spent the past year chilling at Hogwarts and that's without taking into account that McGonagall would likely favour someone from her own house.
