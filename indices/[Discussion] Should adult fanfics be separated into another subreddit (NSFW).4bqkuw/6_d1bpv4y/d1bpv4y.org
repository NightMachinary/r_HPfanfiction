Well, thank you for providing me with something for my next nightmares. Seriously that Pony stuff is beyond creepy...

But anyway, I don't think we need to split the sub like that. Since all that is posted here is mostly written, there is no need to be overly restrictive. Also, this community is very responsible with their tags and handle Smut/NSFW stuff well.
