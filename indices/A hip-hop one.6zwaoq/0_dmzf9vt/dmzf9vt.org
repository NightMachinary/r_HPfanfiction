linkffn(Blurring reality) What about dancing in general? He doesn't do hip hop in this fic, but it definitely captures the spirit of dancing well. It's really well written too and very unique. Completely not what you think it will be, it's more of a psychological thriller set in a dance school with supernatural elements, and also some amazing dance scenes.
