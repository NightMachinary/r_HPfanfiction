And? Unless you have a Philosopher's Stone or a well hidden horcrux(es), you are mortal and bound to die someday. I can point at any random person and say, "you are going to die", and it will be true. They will die. This has absolutely no significance. Do you mean to say Fred was immortal? He was going to die at some point in the future. Would that also have been prediction fulfilled?
