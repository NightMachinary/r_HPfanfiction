I disagree. Yes dumbledor was an important character but he was also a secondary character just like Fred.

If anything, Fred and Harry had more bonding time bc they spent a LOT of time together. -at the burrow -quidditch team -same house -DADA club -the twins gave him the map -spent a lot of time together at headquarters
