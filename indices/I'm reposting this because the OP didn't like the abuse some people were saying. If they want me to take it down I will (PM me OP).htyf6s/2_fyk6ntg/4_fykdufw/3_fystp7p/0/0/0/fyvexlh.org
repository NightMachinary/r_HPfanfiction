That's fair but I think it depends from person to person. For me Fred and George were unidimensional... all they did was say jokes and pull pranks... the only time you see a different side of them is when they beat up Malfoy for insulting their mom. In Dumbledore's case, we see his goods, his bads, his shortcomings and his mistakes. We get to hear his theories and majorly fuck up. He's more human than Fred and George in my opinion.
