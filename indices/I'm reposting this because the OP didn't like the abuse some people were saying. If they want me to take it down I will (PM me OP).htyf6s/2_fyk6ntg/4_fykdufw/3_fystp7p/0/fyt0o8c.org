Harry probably, but not the reader. Fred and George are mentioned here and there and other from brief mentions they do not play a significant role. Dumbledore has pretty much an entire chapter dedicated to him talking to Harry in Books 1-5 and then about 25% of HPB also centered on his interactions with Harry.
