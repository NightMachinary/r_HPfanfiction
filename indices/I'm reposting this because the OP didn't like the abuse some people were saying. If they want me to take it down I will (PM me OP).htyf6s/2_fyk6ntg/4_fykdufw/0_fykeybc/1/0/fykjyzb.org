I will admit that Harry and Daphne's relationship is not immediately obvious on a casual read of the books. However, on a close read, I think it's clear that their relationship is one of the cornerstones of the HP series.

Harry's relationship with Ron and Hermione has a certain dynamic to it. It's burns hot, lots of ups and downs, lots of arguments and adventures. His relationship with Daphne is different, and that's why it's not as attention grabbing as some of the other characters in the series. Daphne really is Harry's emotional rock (or perhaps, ice-cube), always dependable, never-melting.

Not once in the books does Daphne tag along when Harry is hanging out with his friends. She respects that he has his friends, she has her friends, and they can each do their own thing.

It's not necessary for couples to spend all their time together, and that's really the bedrock of Harry and Daphne's canon relationship. They give each other the space they need to be themselves, to feel like they have a life outside of their relationship. That gives them something meaningful to share with each other. They each bring something of value to the relationship; neither one is hanging off the other.

On top of this, of course, you have Daphne's numerous other qualities which make her relationship with Harry the strongest one in the books:

- Unlike Ron, she never betrays him.

- Unlike Ginny, she never needs rescuing by him.

- Unlike Hermione, she never nags him, goes over his head, or considers her opinion more important than his.

- Unlike Cho, she never makes him uncomfortable.

- Unlike Luna, she never does anything weird.

- Unlike Fleur, she never looks down on him.

- Unlike Susan, she never gossips about him.

For those reasons, Harry's relationship with Daphne in canon is undoubtedly his strongest, even if she doesn't have the most lines of dialogue.
