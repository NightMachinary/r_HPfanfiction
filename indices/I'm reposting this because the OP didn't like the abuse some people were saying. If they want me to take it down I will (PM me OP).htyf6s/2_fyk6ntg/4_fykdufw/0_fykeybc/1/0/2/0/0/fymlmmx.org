It's stated as "gang of girls"... Maybe some were younger years. Also to respond to your other message, Daphne only gets mentioned in the series when she gets called inside the Charms OWL together with the other students with a last name starting with 'G'. In the PS version I have she is not even mentioned during sorting. I was under the impression that we only know she was a Slytherin based on the 'Original 40' list shown by JK in some documentary.
