Yes but you mustn't ignore the bad when looking for reasons.

- Daphne offers not one word of support when Umbridge is torturing Harry with the blood quill. Or banning him from Quidditch. Or calling him a liar and attention-seeker.

- Harry almost gets crucio'ed by Umbridge in 5th year. Hell, Harry DEFINITELY gets crucio'ed by Voldemort in 4th year. Daphne's reaction? Pretty much invisible! It's like she couldn't care less about Harry...

- She does not accompany him to the Department of Mysteries even though he would have been in mortal peril.

- When Sirius falls into the veil and Harry almost loses his life jumping after him, Daphne does not lift a finger to help things. If it hadn't been for Remus, the war would have been lost right there and then.

- When Harry calls out for help at Malfoy manner, who responds? Daphne? Oh hell no. Aberforth steps up. One might argue that even Harry knew there was no point in calling Daphne so he just asked for Dumbledore.

Based on these additional points, I feel that Harry's relationship with Daphne may be strong at times, but overall it is much like a breakfast during a milk shortage: *very flaky*.
