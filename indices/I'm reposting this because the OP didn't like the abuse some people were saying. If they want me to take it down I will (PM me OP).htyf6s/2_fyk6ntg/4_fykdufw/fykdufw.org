That's because JKR knew how to play it right afterwards and said in some interview that if George were to look in the Mirror of Erised he'd see Fred or something along those lines and for some reason it stuck with the fans. For Sirius and Dumbledore, we spend an entire volume bonding with each character through Harry's eyes so their death is devastating at the end. In DH all the dead characters are secondary and not that important to Harry, (not even Lupin), but I am sure that if someone were to write a very good fic from, say, George's or Dennis Creevy's perspective, Fred's or Collin's deaths would impact the reader more.
