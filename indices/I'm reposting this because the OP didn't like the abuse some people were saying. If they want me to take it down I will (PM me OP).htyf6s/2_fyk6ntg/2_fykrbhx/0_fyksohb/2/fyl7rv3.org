Then you probably shouldn't be judging JKR's writing when you haven't actually read her writing. Don't get me wrong, it's not flawless, but the movies are not the same as the books. The movies are actually pretty bad, the last half of the series are, anyways. Full of holes that weren't in the books and a lot of characterization just goes out the window. The books have plenty of flaws and room for criticism, but shouldn't be blamed for the movies' shortcomings.
