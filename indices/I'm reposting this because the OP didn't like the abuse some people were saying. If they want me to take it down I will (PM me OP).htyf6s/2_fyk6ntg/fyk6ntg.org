Sigh. I'm so tired of this meme where people pantomime-react to Fred's death. Like, seriously. It was 13 years ago and he wasn't even that big a character in the first place.

Rowling really pulled her punches with character death in DH. No deaths even close to Sirius or Dumbledore in terms of impact. Even with Fred, she killed the one Weasley for whom there's a carbon copy. "Kill the spare" indeed.
