No. Luna likes creatures and plants and has some strange beliefs about the properties/existence of some of them, but nowhere in the series is it hinted that she could foretell the future. The only reason we know Luna took Divination is because of the conversation with Trelawney when she says that Firenze is her teacher that year.
