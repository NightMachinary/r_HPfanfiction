RIP Fred :(

There's a couple things like this in canon, if you squint real hard. In PoA, when Trelawney is upset about dining with the others at Christmas because "when thirteen dine together, the first to rise will be the first to die". But there were /already/ thirteen before she sat down, because Scabbers was there; and Dumbledore, the first to rise, was indeed the first of them to die.

And some of Harry and Ron's Divination homework is downright prophetic, /especially/ the stuff they make up - in GoF, predicting that they will be "in danger of burns" (dragons), "lose a treasured possession" (Ron), "be stabbed in the back by someone you thought was a friend" (Ron again), and "come off worse in a fight" (the graveyard). And Harry's crystal ball final in PoA where he "sees" a Hippogriff flying away.
