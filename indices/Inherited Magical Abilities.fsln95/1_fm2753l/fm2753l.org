I like that the idea of a magical affinity for the learning of languages, since we know in canon that Crouch Sr speaks over two hundred languages, which is pretty much impossible for a humam, meaning he probably used magic to help him.

Another I like is Voldemorts ability to infuse his voice with some force to influence others to listen to him, something he has shown to be able to do as a child. I could easily see something like this being inheritable.

I think both luck and bad luck would also work, with some simply born more or less lucky than others, we know afterall that luck is a real thing, since Felix Felicis exist.
