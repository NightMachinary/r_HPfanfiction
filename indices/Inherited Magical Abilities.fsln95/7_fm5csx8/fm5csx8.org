- Plantspeaking/Plant-based empathy Neville belongs here. Can talk to/instantly understand/know what a plant wants.
- Beast tongue- parseltongue goes here. It's essentially the ability to speak with *A* species of the animal kingdom.
- The Inner-Eye- Divination goes here.
- Elemental- Supreme aptitude to a natural element, wandless manipulations/summoning and whatnot. Fire/Wind/Water/Shadow/Light/Heart/CaptainPlanet
- Shaman -can directly interact with ghosts/spirits AKA touching them
- Runic Dyslexia- The brain is hardcoded for runic languages. Non-runic languages being attempted to read/write get mixed up or are hard to understand. Insanely good at warding/enchanting.
- Savant- Insanely good at math/Arithmancy and/or memory-based occlumancy (or memory recall). You don't have to adhere to real life and just make them anti-social or a watered down asperger syndrome. Where they have no EQ at all and interact badly socially. You can place Madam Pince here. She knows the library back to front and sucks at people interaction.
