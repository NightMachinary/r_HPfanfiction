Not exactly what you asked for but “Let's Try Again” by DayDreamer315

“After the war Harry Potter's world falls apart. Then he is offered a chance to try and make a better future for himself and his friends. Of course things are never simple.”

Harry's parents are alive - all sets of them - and the Longbottoms are sane and well.

(Time-travel, fix-it, redo, Potter!Luck, Dumbledore!Bashing, Selective Weasley!Bashing, Hermione Granger!Bashing, Lily Evans!Bashing, Manipulative!Dumbledore)

(Warning: this is Harry/Fred/George, James/Severus, and Sirius/Remus so if you don't like slash or these ships then best not read.)
