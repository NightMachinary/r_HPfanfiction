fanfictiondownloader.net Seriously, I got this so I could read on my kindle, but it exports into rtf files as well. Copy the url and paste it into the program. It automatically downloads all the chapters, formats them into one file, and puts it wherever you told it to. It is awesome.

It also includes all of the title, author, summary type information, properly formatted at the beginning, and works wonderfully with calibre.
