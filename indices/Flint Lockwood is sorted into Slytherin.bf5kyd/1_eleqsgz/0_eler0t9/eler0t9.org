The "Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs" protagonist.

He's a goofy mad scientist, which sounds like Ravenclaw, but when you take a hard look at what he does and why, he's not in it for the love of knowledge. He wants to make something that will change the world, in order to become popular. And when push comes to shove, he puts that ahead of family, friends, and romantic interest, only turning around when his mistakes have bitten him in the backside.

I think that this mixture of idealism, honesty, wackiness, and cold hard ambition could cause some very interesting waves in Slytherin.
