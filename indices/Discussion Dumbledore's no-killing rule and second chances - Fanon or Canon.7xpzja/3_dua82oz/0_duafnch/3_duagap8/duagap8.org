In my mind it should be different when those being asked to kill are children. Reality forces horrible things to happen. Perhaps the adult of the series could have been more heavy handed but lets be honest, there is a lot the adults could have done differently. Its not dealt with in the correct way, it often feels like it was written by edgy teenagers with little concept of mortality. Some people are fine with killing, others are deeply effected by it. Sometimes if when an author assumes its fine you get the whole Cadmean Victory thing where its one of the most jarring things in the story.
