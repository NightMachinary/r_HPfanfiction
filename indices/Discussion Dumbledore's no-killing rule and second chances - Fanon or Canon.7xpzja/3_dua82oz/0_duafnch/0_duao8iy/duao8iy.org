Not all people are influenced by killing others, but many would be. Simo Hayha had about 200 confirmed kills, though unconfirmed he may have had around 500. He was also a sniper. Not exactly close range. He probably couldn't see the faces of most people he killed.

It would be very different for wizards, who can see the people they are fighting close up.

We don't know what the laws were in the wizarding world at the time of the first war. Maybe they just generally didn't execute people. This would also explain why grindlewald was imprisoned. Wizarding laws in general seem to be pretty different.
