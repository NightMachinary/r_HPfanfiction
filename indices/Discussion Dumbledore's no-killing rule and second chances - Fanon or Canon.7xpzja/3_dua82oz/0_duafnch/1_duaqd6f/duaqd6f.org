Not true.

High treason here is (and always has been) against the Crown, not against the country - and petty treason (now defunct as a charge and not separate to murder) was simply aggravated murder ie of a master by a servant.

And since he was fighting wizards and attempting to overthrow the wizard ministry, which seems to be totally separate from the laws and governance of the Crown, then Voldemort never committed treason under British law...
