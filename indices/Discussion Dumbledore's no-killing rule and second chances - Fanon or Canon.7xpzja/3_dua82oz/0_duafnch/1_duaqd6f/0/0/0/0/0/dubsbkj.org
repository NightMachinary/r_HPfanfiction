There's also the interactions between the Ministers of Magic and the Prime Ministers. The Ministers of Magic that we see are basically saying, "We're doing wizard stuff, sorry about the mess, but you can deal with it" for the most part. Not sure about the relationship between the modern ministry and the crown though.
