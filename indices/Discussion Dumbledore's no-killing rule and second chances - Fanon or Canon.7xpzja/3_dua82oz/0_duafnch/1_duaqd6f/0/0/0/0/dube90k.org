Considering the Crown rules through Her Majesty's government, and the MoM is very clearly portrayed as separate to the government and not overseen by the prime minister, it heavily implies wizards don't have the same status.

However equally some pottermore writings discuss wizards in early royal courts, so maybe it's less clear cut than that.

However strictly in terms of high treason, acting against the ministry doesn't seem to fit the bill.
