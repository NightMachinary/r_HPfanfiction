This is interesting to me. I've long wondered if British wizards are subjects of the Crown. Are they even citizens?

The wizarding setup reminds me of how Ultra-Orthodox Jews operate here in the US. Their own schools, shops, courts, churches---their entire social structure exists as a separate thing. When I think of how wizarding society would be set up here in the US, I use them as my model.
