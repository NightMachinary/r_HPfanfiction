At the same time, not all people are influenced by killing others. For example, look at Simo Hayha, who killed between 700 and 1000 Russians within 100 days at close range and said

#+begin_quote
  "I didn't felt anything towards the enemy. I just fired and loaded and continued as long as there were enemies"
#+end_quote

as well as

#+begin_quote
  "I just shot every time I saw an enemy. I didn't care if he was a commander or not."
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  "I'm a lucky man, I never had dreams about the war. I've always slept well, during the war too."
#+end_quote

and let's not forget

#+begin_quote
  "I did what I was told to as well as I could."
#+end_quote

And let's be honest here, had everyone with a Dark Mark been executed after the first was, things would have been much easier the second time around. Hell, according to British Law of that time, anyone helping Voldemort was comminting Teason and ought to be hanged.
