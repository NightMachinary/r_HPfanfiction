How do we know "few people were missing"? Again, sure, there were quite a few free Death Eaters who answered his summons, but how do we know how many Death Eaters he had back during the First War?

Also, either way (I should probably have started with that), whether the tried Death Eaters were going to Azkaban or to the gallows is essentially irrelevant here. If they could pay to get out of the trials, they could pay to get out of the trials --- the sentence the trials were getting at doesn't really enter into it.
