It's not that there's no viable magical prison, it's that Wizarding Britain happens to have designed the worst imaginable magical prison. Nurmengard could hold /friggin' Grindelwald/, and there's always just Petrifying them and keeping them in a closet until you get a better idea (under /Fidelius/ if need be).
