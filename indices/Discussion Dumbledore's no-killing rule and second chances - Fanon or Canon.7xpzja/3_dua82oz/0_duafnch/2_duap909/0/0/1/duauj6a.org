People didn't escape from Azkaban before Sirius came along either. And the idea of a prison is to keep people away from society and reform them. If they spend 20 years asleep or in stasis they'll have little chance to learn or reform. If they are in stasis for life then they might aswell be dead.

If you just want them kept away from society forever then petrify them and stick them in a grave. Same effect but I'd argue killing them would be more humane.
