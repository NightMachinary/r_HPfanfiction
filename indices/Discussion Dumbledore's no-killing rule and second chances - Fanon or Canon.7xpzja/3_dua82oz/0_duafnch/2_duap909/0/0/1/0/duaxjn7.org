Depends on the certainty of an afterlife and what it looks like. Voldemort's example, at least, suggests that in some cases your last chance at redeeming yourself is in life, and if you go into the Afterlife with too maimed a soul, that's the end of the road for you.

My idea wasn't to keep them Petrified /forever/. I first thought up this idea as an alternative to killing Death Eaters /during the war/, when there's still others at large who'd break them out of a conventional prison. Once the war was won they'd be Mandraked. But even then, if what I'm talking about were to be used in times of peace, it wouldn't be /forever/ --- just until the world is finally a peaceful utopia and dealing with those criminals won't be a problem. Certainly, that's what I'd do with Voldemort if I had the chance, rather than kill him.
