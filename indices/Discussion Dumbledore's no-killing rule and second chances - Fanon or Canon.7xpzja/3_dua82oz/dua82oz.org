Its often taken too far. A lot of fanfiction writers are young. They think killing is easy, that it would make all the problems go away. They wish Harry was more pro-active. When they insert their more pro-active Harry into the world one of the ways you can demonstrate how bad-arse he is, is to contrast him against Dumbledore and therefore canon Harry. There are plenty of examples in the books of people being forgiven when they perhaps shouldn't have been. There are times people avoided punishment when they deserved it. Sometimes people's lives were endangered as part of some redemption plan. Its easy to be frustrated with this and so people in fanon often go too extreme in order to show how much they disagree and how much better it would be if Harry was brutal.
