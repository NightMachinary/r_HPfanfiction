Dumbledore himself seems to have the luxury of being merciful, in that he's such a great wizard that he can incapacitate people just as easily as he could kill them. And certainly we never see him go in for the kill on anyone.

However, we know that the policy of the Order of the Phoenix was to kill, and Dumbledore led the Order, so it does not appear the be a combat philosophy he considers universal. In the books, it's very much Harry who is the proponent of mercy and the Order members who are trying to persuade him to be more ruthless.
