*Woooow!* Is that hinted at in the books at all or a Pottermore original?! I'm always surprised how canon makes Dumbledore into an even bigger asshole than even I could expect (and I am usually called out for bashing Dumbledore too much on this sub).

Is Rowling/Pottermore really saying that Dumbledore abused his headmaster position to expose a fraud, sacrificing 7 years of DADA education? I can't even think about the OWLs and the NEWTs of students in that year. Oh, and relying on an incompetent fraudster of a teacher almost cost Harry and Ron their lives.

This is good stuff. The whole Lockheart incident nails the dichotomy between Dumbledore being either a moron/senile (didn't know) or evil (didn't care) pretty well.
