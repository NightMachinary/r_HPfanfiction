“You do not seek to kill me, Dumbledore?” called Voldemort, his scarlet eyes narrowed. “Above such brutality, are you?” “We both know that there are other ways of destroying a man, Tom,” Dumbledore said calmly. “Merely taking your life would not satisfy me”

One thing that a lot of people forget is that Dumbledores stance on death had nothing to do with mercy.

I would say that anything past second chances is fanon after all when Snape went to Dumbeldore to beg him to save Lily, the dumbledore that we see in that scene is nothing like the weak dumbledore we see in a lot of fanfiction.
