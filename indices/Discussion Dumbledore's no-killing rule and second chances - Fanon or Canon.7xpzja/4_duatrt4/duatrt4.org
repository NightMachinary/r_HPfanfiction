There are three points which people use to show that Dumbledore was too merciful and forgiving.

1. Helping Snape avoid punishment and having him teach at the school.
2. Not eliminating danger coming from Draco.
3. Trying to capture Voldemort in the Ministry.

Let's analyse those.

Ad. 1. Snape was a useful spy (and more) to Dumbledore. And he decisively wasn't nice to him when he offered him "second chance".

  You disgust me,' said Dumbledore, and Harry had never heard so much contempt in his voice. Snape seemed to shrink a little.

  ‘You do not care, then, about the deaths of her husband and child?

  They can die, as long as you have what you want?'

  Snape said nothing, but merely looked up at Dumbledore.

  ‘Hide them all, then,' he croaked. ‘Keep her -- them -- safe. Please.'

  ‘And what will you give me in return, Severus?

Ad. 2. He needed to die in an inconspicuous manner, Draco was useful to this goal.

Ad. 3. At this stage he already knew about horcri, and thus that killing Voldemort would only result in his another return, this time possibly in much worse circumstances.

  The first question that I have never been asked---it has probably been asked in a chatroom but no one has ever asked me---is, “Why didn't Voldemort die?” Not, “Why did Harry live?” but, “Why didn't Voldemort die?” The killing curse rebounded, so he should have died. Why didn't he? At the end of Goblet of Fire he says that one or more of the steps that he took enabled him to survive. You should be wondering what he did to make sure that he did not die---I will put it that way. I don't think that it is guessable. It may be---someone could guess it---but you should be asking yourself that question, particularly now that you know about the prophesy. I'd better stop there or I will really incriminate myself. The other question that I am surprised no one has asked me since Phoenix came out---I thought that people would---is why Dumbledore did not kill or try to kill Voldemort in the scene in the ministry. I know that I am giving a lot away to people who have not read the book. Although Dumbledore gives a kind of reason to Voldemort, it is not the real reason. When I mentioned that question to my husband---I told Neil that I was going to mention it to you---he said that it was because Dumbledore knows that there are two more books to come. As you can see, we are on the same literary wavelength. [Laughter]. That is not the answer; Dumbledore knows something slightly more profound than that.

So in the end, those could work as a proof of "Manipulative Dumbledore", but really not for "Forgive everyone Dumbledore".
