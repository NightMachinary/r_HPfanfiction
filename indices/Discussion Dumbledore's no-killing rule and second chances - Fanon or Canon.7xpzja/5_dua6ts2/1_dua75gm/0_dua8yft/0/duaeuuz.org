Severus Snape followed someone he thought was a werewolf down a protected hidden passage at night on a full moon.

Sirius told Snape how to still the Whomping Willow. We have /no/ evidence either way regarding whether he goaded him to go down the passage on a full moon, and who would expect someone to do that, considering Snape had a long-standing suspicion that Remus was a werewolf.

  if you tell a young, curious boy you know a place where something dangerous happens and tell him how to break into a serial killers house the blood is on you

What if you are also a young, rash boy? Also, it's not a serial killer, it's a believed werewolf. Werewolves are only dangerous once a month, at night, and will almost certainly attack. A serial killer is always dangerous. It's a bad analogy.
