  He didn't expel Sirius for attempted murder.

Snape is just as guilty in that incident as Sirius. Sirius merely said how to get past the willow, Snape was stupid enough to go investigate some rather well-protected thing in the middle of the night. It was not a smart thing of Sirius to do, but certainly not attempted murder. If I tell you how to disarm a mine and you get blown up in a minefield, it is not my fault that you took that risk. If anything, Dumbledore can be blamed for the rather stupid security measures. Why not use a simple portkey instead of some cloak and dagger approach?
