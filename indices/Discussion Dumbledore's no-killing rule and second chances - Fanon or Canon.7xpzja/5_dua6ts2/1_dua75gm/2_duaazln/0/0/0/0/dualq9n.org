That dialogue is /after/ the Werewolf incident has happened. As part of the same conversation is this:

  “They don't use Dark Magic, though.” She dropped her voice. “And you're being really ungrateful. I heard what happened the other night. You went sneaking down that tunnel by the Whomping Willow, and James Potter saved you from whatever's down there -- ”

  Snape's whole face contorted and he spluttered, “Saved? Saved? You think he was playing the hero? He was saving his neck and his friends' too! You're not going to -- I won't let you -- ”

He's forbidden to talk about it. That's why he's hinting at it and not outright stating it. There's no evidence to suggest that he knew he was facing a werewolf when Sirius told him how to get to the Whomping Willow.
