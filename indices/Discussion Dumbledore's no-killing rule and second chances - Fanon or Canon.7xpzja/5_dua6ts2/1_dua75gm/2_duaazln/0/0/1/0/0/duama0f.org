  That dialogue is after the Werewolf incident has happened.

And you think Snape would have mentioned something enough over the course of a day in order for it to be "his theory"? *Especially considering it seems to be a regular thing, as Lily is 'cold' in response.*

I certainly read it to be him bringing it up /again/, with it being a long-standing belief, as it supported by the two PoA quotes.

Clearly, it's impossible to know exactly, but I think what we /do/ know supports the claim that he knew about it before the Prank.
