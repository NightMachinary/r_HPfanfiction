From Deathly Hallows, 'The Prince's Tale':

#+begin_quote
  “They sneak out at night. There's something weird about that Lupin. Where does he keep going?”

  “He's ill,” said Lily. “They say he's ill ---”

  “Every month at the full moon?” said Snape.

  “I know your theory,” said Lily, and she sounded cold. “Why are you so obsessed with them anyway? Why do you care what they're doing at night?”

"I know your theory" shows that it's a regular theory he's mentioned to her.

Also, from Prisoner of Azkaban, 'Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs':

#+begin_quote
  “It served him right,' [Sirius] sneered. ‘Sneaking around, trying to find out what we were up to ... hoping he could get us expelled ...'

  ‘Severus was very interested in where I went every month,' Lupin told Harry, Ron and Hermione.”

So I think it's pretty clear that Snape suspected Remus was a werewolf.
