  Not really, considering she refers to it as "the other night". That's a couple of days at most.
#+end_quote

Now you're arguing semantics. "The other night" could easily be applied to something that happened weeks ago. Going by your logic, if it happened so recently, she would have mentioned "a couple of nights ago" to make it specific. But she didn't. So time has elapsed.

  2) No, his belief is probably something like "Hey, I'll tell this guy who's trying to out my best friend's secret how to still the Whomping Willow, I doubt he'll be stupid enough to go down it on a full moon"
#+end_quote

Again, speculation.

#+begin_quote
  Again, Remus is also commenting, and it matches. Also, it matches Snape's own memory, where he discusses a curiosity, and stalking them.
#+end_quote

Please point out where Snape stalks the Marauders in any of his memories.

  I mean, yeah, it's possible that Remus' mother was sick once a month every month./s
#+end_quote

People don't automatically assume someone's a Werewolf just because they skip class once a month. Even Hermione only came to the conclusion because of Snape's homework.

#+begin_quote
  Snape isn't particularly dumb
#+end_quote

Yeah. That's also why he wouldn't knowingly confront a Werewolf on the full moon.

#+begin_quote
  Literally exactly what I said; "It's impossible to know exactly".

  Sirius told a fellow student a fact about the Whomping Willow, that *said student had been searching for.* Said student broke curfew to follow another student on a staff-sanctioned excursion, down a hidden, secret passageway, on a full-moon, *with the intention of getting him expelled.*
#+end_quote

You're contradicting yourself here. You're saying it's impossible to know exactly but you're once again saying that Snape knew Remus was a Werewolf and went to expose him to get him expelled, neither of which are supported by canon.
