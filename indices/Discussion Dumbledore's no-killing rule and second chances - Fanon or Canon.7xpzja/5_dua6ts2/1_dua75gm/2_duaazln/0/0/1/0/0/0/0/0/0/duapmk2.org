  Now you're arguing semantics.
#+end_quote

I don't think that's semantics. "The other night" would refer to anything older than "last night", and anything up to, say "a week ago".

#+begin_quote
  Going by your logic
#+end_quote

What is my logic, supposedly? That people are unerringly specific? Or that they generally use vague time frames with /some/ accuracy?

#+begin_quote
  Again, speculation.
#+end_quote

Shockingly, yeah. We can't know what Sirius was thinking when he said it, because JKR hasn't deigned to give us that information. The same with what Sirius and Snape said to each other; if Sirius goaded Snape, if Snape mentioned that night specifically, we have no idea, but we can make educated guessed - Sirius /probably/ isn't planning on killing Snape. I think that is a relatively innocuous statement with some degree of validity.

#+begin_quote
  Please point out where Snape stalks the Marauders in any of his memories.
#+end_quote

Sure thing!

#+begin_quote
  “*They sneak out at night.* There's something weird about that Lupin. Where does he keep going?”

  “He's ill,” said Lily. “They say he's ill ---”

  “Every month at the full moon?” said Snape.

  “I know your theory,” said Lily, and she sounded cold. “*Why are you so obsessed with them anyway? Why do you care what they're doing at night?*”

  “I'm just trying to show you they're not as wonderful as everyone seems to think they are.”
#+end_quote

Lily, his best friend, certainly seems to think he's obsessed, and he just happens to know they sneak out all the time. Also, Remus states that Snape saw Madam Pomfrey taking Remus to the passageway, a claim with some evidence, considering that Snape knows about the passageway, and that he knows Remus goes into it.

#+begin_quote
  That's also why he wouldn't knowingly confront a Werewolf on the full moon.
#+end_quote

Because there is no difference between a clever person trying to figure out a problem over a period of time, and someone rashly trying to prove that their theory is right by discovering an enemy's secret?

They are /vastly/ different scenarios, but yeah, Snape probably wouldn't intend to come face-to-face with a werewolf. What he'd want is probably what he got; just enough of a view to know that Remus is a werewolf, without dying.

#+begin_quote
  You're contradicting yourself here.
#+end_quote

Not at all, I'm speculating and making theories based on my understanding of the characters. I'm not claiming it as canonical fact that Snape was searching for the information, although Remus' comment certainly supports that. I'm merely explaining the situation as I believe it most likely occurred.

#+begin_quote
  neither of which are supported by canon
#+end_quote

Sirius claims that Snape tried to get them expelled, and Remus supported his claim.

But considering you're discrediting one (and by extension two) of the three sources of information we have, our "canon" information is remarkably small, so we have to make assumptions, such as 'someone commenting on a oft-repeated theory is more likely to be bored of it, and so seem "cold" towards it', '"the other night" probably refers to a couple of days ago', and 'Snape, a character shown to hold a grudge and use Remus' condition against him, quite possibly didn't have the best of reasons to follow him at night'.
