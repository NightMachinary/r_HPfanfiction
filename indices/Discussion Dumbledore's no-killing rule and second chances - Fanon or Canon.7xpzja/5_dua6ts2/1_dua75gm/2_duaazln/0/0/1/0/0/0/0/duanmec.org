  And significant time could have elapsed between when the incident occurred and this conversation

Not really, considering she refers to it as "the other night". That's a couple of days at most.

  The quote you have from POA is from Sirius, whose belief is that a sixteen year old Snape deserved to be murdered for being curious
#+end_quote

1) It's from Sirius and Remus discussing their school years, who else do you want me to get information from?

2) No, his belief is probably something like "Hey, I'll tell this guy who's trying to out my best friend's secret how to still the Whomping Willow, I doubt he'll be stupid enough to go down it on a full moon"

#+begin_quote
  I place as much importance on his fucked up opinion about Snape as Snape's own fucked up opinions about James Potter.
#+end_quote

Again, Remus is also commenting, and it matches. Also, it matches Snape's own memory, where he discusses a curiosity, and stalking them.

#+begin_quote
  It's clear that Snape knew there was something off, but that he knew there was a Werewolf waiting for him is speculation.
#+end_quote

I mean, yeah, it's possible that Remus' mother was sick once a month every month.^{/s}

I think it's pretty obvious he had suspicions that Remus was a werewolf, considering "Hey, maybe Remus is a werewolf" is already known as "his theory", a couple of days after the Prank. Along with the fact that Snape isn't particularly dumb, and can probably put "boy vanishes at full moon, comes back tired and injured" together.

#+begin_quote
  speculation
#+end_quote

Literally exactly what I said; "It's impossible to know exactly".

#+begin_quote
  Sirius gave information to an enemy that would have compromised two lives, so the blame falls clearly in his court.
#+end_quote

Sirius told a fellow student a fact about the Whomping Willow, that said student had been searching for. Said student broke curfew to follow another student on a staff-sanctioned excursion, down a hidden, secret passageway, /on a full-moon/, with the intention of getting him expelled.

+There's not a court in the land that would convict h--+

+He'd probably be sentenced to Azkaban without trial.+

*Edit:* Misread your final sentence. I disagree, since Snape is an intelligent, conscience human, who is probably capable of thinking "hidden passageway + possible werewolf + full moon = danger".
