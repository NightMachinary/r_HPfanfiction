#+begin_quote
  snape didn't think sirius would put him in any actual danger
#+end_quote

That's pure conjecture, and you're using it to make assumptions. We have no idea what their conversation consisted of, or what the characters where thinking.

#+begin_quote
  he did tell him how to go
#+end_quote

All we know is that he told him how to stop the Whomping Willow. We don't know if he encouraged him to go or anything.

#+begin_quote
  that he did tell him how to go either meant his suspicion about remus was wrong somehow
#+end_quote

You're assuming that Snape trusted what Sirius said.

#+begin_quote
  he wanted to investigate
#+end_quote

He was doing that anyway.

#+begin_quote
  that remus was restrained or something
#+end_quote

Yeah, it was "or something"; he was put in a secret building with a hidden passage.
