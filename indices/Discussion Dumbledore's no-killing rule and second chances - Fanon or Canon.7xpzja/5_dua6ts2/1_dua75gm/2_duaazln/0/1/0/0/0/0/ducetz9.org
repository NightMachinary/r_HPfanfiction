and you're being obtuse. snape, lupin and sirius describe it as a 'trick' sirius played on snape. they *all* frame it as something sirius does /to/ snape. what's the 'trick', if not that he didn't know he would be in danger, and that he was is explicitly what he holds against him. why would he insist he was tricked into danger, and why would they agree, if he...wasn't? we don't have to be spoon-fed their entire conversation. that sirius is culpable and snape a victim is never even challenged, once
