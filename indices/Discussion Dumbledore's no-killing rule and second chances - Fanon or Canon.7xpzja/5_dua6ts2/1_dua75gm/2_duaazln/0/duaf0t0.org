  Sirius didn't tell Snape how to disarm the mine. He didn't even tell him there was a mine to disarm.

  why would Snape think it's dangerous at all? He knows Remus goes there, how dangerous could it possibly be?

Snape is stated to have had a long-standing suspicion that Remus was a werewolf. He followed a believed werewolf down a protected hidden passageway on a full moon, don't claim he didn't know it was dangerous.

Snape was a colossal idiot, and I don't think Sirius was to blame for Snape deciding to explore the passageway on the /one night/ in the month that it would be dangerous.
