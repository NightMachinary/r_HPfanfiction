To stretch the analogy a little further... The danger here is Remus. Sirius didn't tell Snape how to disarm the mine. He didn't even tell him there was a mine to disarm. He just told him how to sneak into the field. And why would Snape think it's dangerous at all? He knows Remus goes there, how dangerous could it possibly be?

Although I agree that it seems a bit silly on Dumbledore's part. J K Rowling regularly give him the idiot ball to make the plot work.
