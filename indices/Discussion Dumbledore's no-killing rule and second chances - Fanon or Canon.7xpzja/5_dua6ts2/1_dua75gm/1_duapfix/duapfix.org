  If anything, Dumbledore can be blamed for the rather stupid security measures. Why not use a simple portkey instead of some cloak and dagger approach?

Same reason that protections on precious things (be they Dumbledore's; Voldemort's or Hermione's) are solvable challenges as opposed to actual protections. The Wizarding World seems to have a strange approach to protections in general. Thank Merlin the goblins are a bit (a /bit/) more reasonable about such things.

More seriously, though, there's also the possibility that the /Marauders/ came up with the whole Whomping Willow ruse themselves, and Dumbledore just agreed with it because it was already half-done by the time they told him.
