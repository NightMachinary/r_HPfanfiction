We know, for example, that he didn't kill Grindelwald. He forgive Snape. He didn't just eliminate the threat of Malfoy in HBP, instead giving him the chance to be redeemed. He didn't expel Sirius for attempted murder. I think he had strong suspicions about what Tom would become but never took action to stop him while he was still young. He captured the death eaters in OotP instead of killing them.

So, probably canon.
