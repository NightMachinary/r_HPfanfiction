For the second chances, I think others in the wizarding world see Dumbledore as being too willing to give second chances based almost entirely on misunderstanding why he is giving the second chance in the first place. Neither he nor Snape share why Dumbledore trusts him, so naturally enough people may consider that Snape hasn't earned it and that Dumbledore hands out his second chances too freely. This is exactly what Harry does for years and only stops thinking this when Snape lays out the reason in his memories.

Before we have the full story, the impression is that Dumbledore gives them out too easily, when I think in actuality, Dumbledore's second chances are incredibly hard won. Snape earned his second chance. And he continued to earn it.

I don't think that Dumbledore manipulated Snape's feeling into being a spy, because that goes against everything I feel the series stands for, and also because it seems extremely strategically weak.
