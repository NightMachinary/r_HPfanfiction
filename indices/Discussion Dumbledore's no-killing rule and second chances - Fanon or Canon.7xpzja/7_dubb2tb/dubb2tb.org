I'm not going to comment on Dumbledore much because that has been covered by others, but he definitely didn't stop the Order from killing...

“Harry, the time for Disarming is past! These people are trying to capture and kill you! At least Stun if you aren't prepared to kill!” ~Remus Lupin, Chapter 5 of Deathly Hallows.

As far as canon goes those people obviously don't care much about staying with canon, and while that isn't intrinsically bad, it is when they insist that they /are/ following canon and also generally have a terrible plot.
