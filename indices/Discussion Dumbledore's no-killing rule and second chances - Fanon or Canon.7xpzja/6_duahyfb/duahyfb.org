As other's have commented, Dumbledore didn't think that death was enough. I doubt he relished killing and while he has the power to do it, he often takes a step back from those big moments of using his power. Like he says when he was talking to Harry at King's cross, he didn't trust himself with power over death so I'm sure that plays a part too.

With Snape, Dumbledore doesn't just accept his apology. He makes him his spy, plays on his feelings for Lily to make him an asset to the order. And when she dies, he plays on those same feelings to basically commit Snape's life to Dumbledore.
