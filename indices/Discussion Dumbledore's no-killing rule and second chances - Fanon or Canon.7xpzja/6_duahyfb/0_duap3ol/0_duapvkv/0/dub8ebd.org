I agree totally. I think it comes from humans' tendancy to feel comforted that responsibility isn't on our shoulders because it's on someone else's. And like with employers and their bosses and teenagers and their parents, it's cathartic to blame the authority when things go wrong. But first we have to convince ourselves that they /could/ have prevented the problem, and /chose/ not to because they either don't care about our feelings or maybe even hate us. If we acknowledged that our parents or our bosses cared and did their best, then there's little emotional reward in blaming them. While I still think that a person who places himself in an authority position should be held responsible, I think many fans take it too far when they hold Dumbledore responsible for everyone else's actions too, and for almost any injustice. The fact he didn't fix a problem couldn't possibly mean he's less /able/, so it /must instead/ mean he /chose/ not to fix it. I have seen Dumbledore's "inability" to care for or understand other people's emotions explained as the character flaw that proves he is just a human just like we all are. But I don't think that version of Dumbledore is human, regardless of the thesis statement the author thinks they are supporting.

And of course, a lot of people believe Aberforth's account.
