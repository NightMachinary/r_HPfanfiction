I don't know where this comes from either. Strangely, I've seen this argument for other characters too, like "Dumbledore forced Sirius to stay locked up in Grimmauld Place" and "Dumbledore forced Remus to spy on the Werewolves".

It's interesting that in a series where choice is one of the main themes, people seem determined to deprive adult characters of agency to force a particular reading of Dumbledore. All these people, Sirius, Remus and Snape, were against Voldemort for their own reasons and whatever choices they made were for that end goal. Yeah, Dumbledore took advantage of that, but honestly why wouldn't he? He didn't just take; he offered these people a way to fight.
