I mean Snape sort of does. He spends the rest of his life as one of Dumbledore's most trusted and from what we see, doesn't really interact with anyone else in a meaningful way. He dedicates his life to stopping Voldemort and protecting Harry in Lily's memory, and he does that through his service to Dumbledore. I'm not meaning that in some sort of sinister way like he was a slave or something. Dumbledore gave a broken and hurting young man with no direction, a purpose in life.
