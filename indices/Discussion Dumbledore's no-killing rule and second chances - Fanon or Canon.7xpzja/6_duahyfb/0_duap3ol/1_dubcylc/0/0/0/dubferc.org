I agree with everything you just said here! This is much more of a linguistic interest to me than a Harry Potter one at this point, so feel free to stop responding at any time. I feel that saying "he plays on those same feelings to basically commit Snape's life to Dumbledore" connotes something slightly different than "Snape spends the rest of his life as one of Dumbledore's most trusted". The first Dumbledore is the actor while Snape is being acted upon, and in the second sentence, Snape is the actor. I find it so interesting how phrasing can say so much more than each individual word. :)
