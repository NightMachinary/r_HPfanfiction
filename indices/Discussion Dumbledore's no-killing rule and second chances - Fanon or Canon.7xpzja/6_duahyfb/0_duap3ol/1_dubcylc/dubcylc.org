I don't think Dumbledore forced him to do anything. I am really not one of those Dumbledore is an evil master manipulator crowd lol. But snape came to Dumbledore to ask him to protect Lily and Dumbledore asks him what Snape can give him in return when he was full well going to protect her anyway. Snape replies, 'Anything.' That is using Snape's feeling for Lily to turn him into a spy.

I have no doubt that what you said is true too. He does want to give Snape that chance. I don't think it has to be either or the other. Dumbledore was a war leader, but also a compassionate person.
