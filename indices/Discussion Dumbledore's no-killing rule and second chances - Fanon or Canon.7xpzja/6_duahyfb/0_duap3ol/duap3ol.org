What about the books makes you describe Snape's turning this way? Would you disagree if I said, "Dumbledore doesn't just accept his apology, he also gives Snape an opportunity to create a good from the bad, he gives Snape the ability for Snape to help himself"? Would you say this implies something slightly different than what you said?

It's how common this sort of word use is that confuses me. I read the scenes where Dumbledore and Snape meet on the hilltop and see something so so different. Where does the idea that Snape would not have done it without being manipulated come from? Where is it clear that Dumbledore needs to depend upon manipulation in order to get the results he wants come from? In the scene I read, it is clear that Snape himself is earning his own worth, and that his worth is not being forced out of him.
