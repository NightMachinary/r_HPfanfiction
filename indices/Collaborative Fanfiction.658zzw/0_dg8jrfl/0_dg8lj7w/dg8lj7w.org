Thank you for your lovely reply!

1.1) What a insightful guess :P In addition to the initial team, we have a Herbology professor now and a part-time Charms professor who are both on the world building team, regardless.

1.2) We really want to keep this an open world, so if people are interested in classes, we'll expand our offering there, or more interested in roleplaying, quidditch, events, etc., etc., we're going to grow and change based on user interest.

1.3) This week is an initial setting up time until classes start. During this week, we would like to get a lot of student imput during this week, and this can include world building or chat ooc if they'd like. After classes start, aside from the ooc chat we're going to stick to a more in character approach.

1.4) The rules are otherwise flexible, apart from staying in character. If something comes up, we'll deal with it and adapt, of course. Any contributions to the rules would be welcome, as well.

2) It's in present day (with the ghost of Dumbledore as headmaster. It's all quite mysterious really...) One might say it's uncanny how they all disappeared or were replaced by the time Albus Potter was starting school... (Albus starts school the year after this one, canon-wise. Each semester is eight weeks, there's a week between semesters and three weeks summer break)

3.1) More detail is in the [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zAd2iKfwXSgfWJvgV84ppYNO7B3xFopaRPKrmwSm8X4][code of conduct]], but basically follow redditique, don't give yourself excessive powers because everyone starts as a first year, and be polite. We'll deal with niche problems on a case-by-case basis otherwise.

3.2) You need permission to cause another player to make an action. For example, you can throw a snowball at me in Hogsmeade, but you cannot make me throw a snowball back. And if I protest that I wasn't in Hogsmeade at all, then you would have to delete/edit what you originally said. Based on this structure, we'd like to encourage collaboration.

3.3) Yes, problems arise when professors/prefects cannot be everywhere at once, but we'd like to encourage students to screenshot events that go against the code of conduct and owl (pm) them to staff. We also hope to improve our bot to combat spamming and other transgressions. Also, if a student gets four warnings, typically they get kicked. We want a welcoming inclusive community, and if someone can't respect that, we'd rather keep order and sacrifice the size.

3.4) Everyone starts out as a first year. Unforgivables are not canon-ly learned by this time, and it would be extremely hard to brew those potions. If someone is taking (or wishes to take) actions that may be seen as controversial, they should talk to staff. Timeturners have all been destroyed, and we're not counting Cursed Child as canon.

4) The student either becomes a background NPC if that seems like the appropriate course of action (if they never had much multiplayer action to begin with) or if they were involved, they will be transferred, expelled, or mysteriously disappear depending on the character/plot.

5) If someone want to be the heir of Slytherin, we won't stop them, but we're not granting anyone any special powers. At this point in history, no werewolves or vampires are allowed in Hogwarts either. The ministry has improved the trace so although purebloods might have more knowledge of the theory of spells, everyone is practically on an equal level.

6) It depends on the teacher. The classes are all going to vary, for example the professor teaching History of Magic teaches AP History irl so it's going to be a very challenging course. Transfiguration, on the other hand, also focuses mainly on theory but will be a much easier workload with participation being 70% of the grade. Potions will focus more on practicals, and branch out from theory, etc. etc. Your professors should make this clear to you when signing up, or you can owl (pm) them with questions (this was the main purpose of the "have a chat with your professor in their office). However, I can see a paragraph essay being submitted if the character wants to. It depends on your character's work ethic also, and we won't say no to longer essays if you feel passionate.

7) Spamming was merely an ooc way to be clear, but thanks for the suggestion, perhaps we'll list that with spamming in italics. We'd rather expel students who break these rules. Obviously, saying something in character or minor aggressions won't be counted but if someone repeatedly breaks school policy with multiple warnings and consequences, we'd rather not have them on the server.

8?) The transfiguration alphabet was shown in the movies, and I think it's similar to ancient runes? Tis not my specialty but the transfiguration teacher is very skilled and I'm sure she would also be open to questions and more knowledgable about her topic than me :P

Thank you for the questions! They were quite helpful.
