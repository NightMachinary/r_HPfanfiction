Ah, but first year on first year? Or in a couple "years," fourth year on first year? You learn unforgivables in fourth year, apparently, so could fourth year me offer to tutor a first year and then spring a surprise duel on them and just obliviate them of, well, everything (think Lockhart)? Or just Avada Kedavra and then leave.
