Oh yeah, well, advanced spells are limited, and if you haven't formally learned a spell in class, it is unreliable while using it while dueling usually. It's a valid concern, and someone quite clever could probably get around the system, but it's unlikely anyone would be killed, and if they were they could make another character, and the fourth year would be expelled.
