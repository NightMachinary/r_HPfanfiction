There's a system for duels which largely prevents this, and unforgivables are mainly about emotion and state of mind so however unlikely it is for a fourth year to learn, it would be near impossible to teach a first year. Yes, maybe by the end of first year, a first year could stun another one, but nothing of long lasting damage, and nothing lethal. I doubt that a troll would actively participate for all seven years until they could kill off their classmates. Even Harry couldn't perform an unforgivable in sixth year and he showed great strength of mind. Hermione, an extremely gifted witch learned obliviate in seventh year, so this also shows the difficulty of these spells. If this becomes an issue as students progress, we'll add a rule nullifying these actions, but like you pointed out we'd rather not pretend things didn't happen and not be able to give consequences.
