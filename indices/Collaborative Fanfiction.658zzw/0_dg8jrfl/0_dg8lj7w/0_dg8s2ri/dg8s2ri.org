Re: 3.3 and 3.4, most of canon magic is easily exploitable. Is there anything stopping me from just saying "I wingardium leviosa my class mate and throw him out the window. He dies." Or, "I stub my transfiguration teacher from behind as she is helping another student, and ten take my transfigured needle and stab it through her eye. She dies," etc. Magic is rife with methods for abuse and every child is running around with a deadly weapon.

Sure, I would be expelled, as you say, but you can't really just make up a reason the teacher isn't dead. If you retcon it to such a way that I didn't do that, then you have no reason to expel me. I always like finding exploits in games and seeing how the devs react to them, so even though I wouldn't actually do that, I'd like to know what the reaction would be if I did.
