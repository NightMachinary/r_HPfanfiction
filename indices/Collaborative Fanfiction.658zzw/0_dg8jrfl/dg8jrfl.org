A fascinating endeavour! Here's a bunch of questions:

1.1) +How many people are involved in maintaining the project? How many people are involved in worldbuilding?+ I'm guessing 6 people so far.

1.2) How deep are players expected to poke at the world-building and lore?

1.3) Are the players expected to meta-game to build the setting and\or discuss its construction with the project hosts?

  Have a live chat with your professor in their office

1.4) The host would have to have a rather thorough design notes for their subject's “rules” in the setting for a live event like this to hold true, no?

2) What's the timeline of the setting?

3.1) What is (not) allowed for players to do?

3.2) How much is a player allowed to interact with another player's character, especially without the collaboration and\or approval of the other player?

3.3) If not too much, how are you planning to maintain the illusion of the “multiplayer” aspect of the game? If as much as --- for the characters --- realistically possible, how are you planning to stop potential griefing without breaking the 4th wall? The professor and prefect characters can not be expected to be omniscient, after all.

3.4) What about vanilla!canon stuff that'd be easy to abuse due to its OP nature (Imperio, Obliviate, Polujuice, Legilimency, Time Turners, etc)?

4) What happens if a player stops participating in the project halfway through? Does their character mysteriously disappear from the school, become a background NPC that's “supposed to be there”, something else?

5) What are the limits for character background creation (e.g. “just a muggleborn” v.s. “a pureblood family heir” v.s. “heir of Slytherin+Gryffindor”, etc)

6) Are essay-type homeworks expected to be actually written? If yes, how many words on average are they expected to be?

  Expulsion on 4th Offence for: Disrespect to School Employees, Misbehaviour in the Classroom, Failure to Follow Reasonable Requests, Harassment / Bullying, Participating in or Provoking a Verbal Altercation, Use of Discriminatory Slurs, Spamming
#+end_quote

7) In-universe, a punishment system like this looks rather draconic. I'd suggest “putting the players in jail” instead: their characters would be given “detentions” for a given period and the player would be unable to control them. The last one isn't an in-universe offence at all. Maybe change it to “disruption of peace” or somesuch?

What's a Transfiguration Alphabet and how's it supposed to help with actual transfiguration practice?

In either case I'd like to wish you luck and good experience with this test-drive.
