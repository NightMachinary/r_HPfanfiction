I really love Oliversnape's work - lots of Harry and Snape interactions.

My favorite Hermione fic is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7944847][Six Pomegranate Seeds]] by Seselt - she's totally badass and so smart. It is complete and has a sequel.

Dudley's Memories by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Paganaidd/pseuds/Paganaidd][Paganaidd]]

I really like this story about Harry and Dudley meeting when they are older. It is part of a series, so if you like this one, there is more.

I've been reading this story ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052940/1/The-Bureaucratic-Error][The Bureaucratic Error]]) about Remus Lupin being thrust back in time as a way to understand his character better. I love the nuance and insight Iniga lends to his characterization. It is a WIP and updated regularly.
