Fic idea where Fleur or Viktor decides to lend a helping hand to Harry and move schools and inadvertently bring Voldemort chase Harry down to the country of the school he moves in and sparking international wizarding war. Harry may or may not fall for either one or fall for someone else in whichever school he decides to attend to, try to keep things as culture realistic as possible (as in how some wizarding communities unlike their muggle counterpart still hold the older values and doesn't seem insistent on moving past them and so on, but ay it's up to you)

Another one for where Severus decides on pestering the Sorting Hat to put him in the same house as Lily Evans because since surnames goes first by alphabetical order... Force Potter and Snape to grudgingly make a truce with each other lol it'll be funny haha maybe, just maybe, they actually have some things in common enough to be tentative friends?

Another one's when Harry decides to go back in the past as he wants to save everyone, cue Hermione ranting at him about his saving other people habit needs to stop as time travel is dangerous and shouldn't be messed around with. Harry decides he'd rather have his godfather and god child's father and mother should have survived, the Weasley family shouldn't have lost Fred, Percy should have never been so bewitched by the Ministry, etc and sneaks out to do it secretly, bringing along his invisible cloak, and uses the three Deathly Hallows to summon death and make a deal with him. Deal is that Death can be free of him in this world and the other world, Harry will make sure of this by not collecting all three of the Deathly Hallows. Death accepts because no one is master of Death but himself. Also, he does this instead of being his younger self, or even making a new identity, or /hell/ even being someone else who already exists (like merging with Lockhart). He's going to stay as Harry Potter, older age and all, and just wear the invisibility cloak 24/7 stalking people and leaving them letters and notes, following them until they read it to try and stop certain things from happening but this time around he knows how to make himself /completely undetectable/ and he might also /cough/ just deal with some of those matters himself. Lets himself enter into the Grimmauld place, befriend Kreacher, getting rid of Horcruxes, saving Sirius, bringing Remus along, tell them who he is truly via pensive memories, and then when he feels like the time is right (after most things are settled, say the Hoxcruxes, getting rid of Voldemort (by maybe, oh you know, just never letting Quirrell head to Albania in the first place and catch the soul gas of Voldemort and put him in a bottle and hand him to Dumbledore for him to decide on what to do because Harry doesn't really give a damn if Voldy lives or dies), destroying the Death Eaters he knows, etc) show himself to younger Harry, tell him the truth and let him choose to either introduce older Harry as who he really is (future harry going back into the past to fix things) or fake his identity as some long lost cousin who just found out he was a Potter or something after arriving in the British Wizarding World to change currencies with the goblins in Gringotts bank or something along those lines. The rest of the story focuses on slowly but surely settling young Harry and the others to come to terms with older Harry's existence, improving the magical society bit by bit.

Also perhaps when they decide to summon the 'saviour of the wizarding world that could defeat the Dark Lord' from some other dimension where the Dark Lord was defeated, they bring either another reiteration of Voldemort himself who defeated Grindelwald instead of Dumbledore or younger Dumbledore who was the accomplice of the Dark Lord at the time aka Grindelwald and backstabbed him just as they were about to win the war by stating that it was for the greater good and ended up being the Minister for Magic (hence no Voldy because that Riddle was say visited by someone else who didn't decide to scare young children who might be a bit unhinged by burning their wooden closet and instead rehabilitated young little bitty Riddle Jr. somehow through 'love' or just lots and lots of montages showing the benefits to /not/ being in his I am unique, everyone else is beneath me mindset is loads better in all sorts of ways or /cough/ used mind magic to just... make the mental health issue disappear! Like....magic! *poof* /cough/) was in the middle of having a meeting when suddenly he was brought over to the other world and met the other Dumbledore with lots of confusion and then annoyance before starting to heavily criticise the grandfatherly headmaster Dumbledore and ended up taking over that world's ministry for magic because Savior of the World in another dimension Dumbledore decides the risks to attempt and head back was impossible and is going to make do with this world instead and lots of character growth and bonding and politics and war tactics to defeat Voldy Moldy. The details are up to you really haha but this is the messy gist of it!

Got more probably but I shan't spend more time typing this plot bunnies instead of attending to my essay due tomorrow midnight /screams/
