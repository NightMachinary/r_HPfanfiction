But what does he have to gain? He isn't coming from a place of no power. He could already have been minister if he wanted. He is a beloved figure in the community and killing Voldemort would increase the prestige. His only enemies are the same people would hate and oppose him in this plan.

That is the biggest hurtle in my mind. He needs to have a good reason to go down this road, something that could not be acquired elsewhere. If someone writes this, then to get the best out of it they need to really think about what he could gain. I am not saying that the story premise is bad, just difficult. If pulled off well it would be beautiful.
