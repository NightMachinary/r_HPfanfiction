This would be really hard to pull off, the whole premise is that Dumbledore is convincing people that he didn't do a good job. The common folk think that the boogie man still exists because Dumbledore failed to finish it. Unless he still uses Harry, but that is close to the main story, where most people didn't believe he was back.

First we would have to figure out what power Dumbledore wants to gain that couldn't be acquired easier by just announcing that he had killed Voldemort. Maybe a more militarized state? Then we would have to have him do things to keep up signs of a return. Because after a while people would grow bored and he would lose his power base. Lastly he would need a way to ensure loyalty, since his whole gambit is based on the illusion that someone who can oppose him is coming back.

It would be an interesting story, but really hard to do without giant plot holes. I would love to read a well done stab at this.
