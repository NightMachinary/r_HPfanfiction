First, this is something I would love to see on this sub. I really like this idea a lot and may just start writing fanfics myself because of this.

Second--due to me still being grumpy about /Faith and Understanding/ taken down (I think the author just deleted her FFN account), I'd love to see a story that chronicles the friendship of Ginny Weasley and Luna Lovegood.
