I would make following changes to CC:

1. Throw out the time turner plot completely

2. Make resurrection stone the dangerous artifact

3. Keep Delphi as the main villain, but remove her status as Voldemort's child

4. Make Rose actually contribute to the story

5. Show Hermione as an ambitious, cunning, intelligent, ruthless, and visionary politician/leader

6. Show Harry as a lead-by-example general who has the loyalty of his wizards/witches

7. Involve far more characters: Neville, Luna, Teddy, the Weasleys, Andi
