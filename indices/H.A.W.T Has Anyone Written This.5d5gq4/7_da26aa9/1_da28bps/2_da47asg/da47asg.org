I started writing one (not what you want to hear, I'm sure) and got perhaps halfway through the first draft but for Reasons (1. because I'm working on a novel, and 2. because I posted a CC one shot which tied into my fix-fic and got virtually no readers which led me to think there is not much interest in such a thing), I put it aside. I might come back to it because it already represents several weeks of work and I don't like to think of it being unfinished.

I'm not quite ready to give it away yet anyway.
