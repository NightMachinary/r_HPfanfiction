Oh, wow, you actually used my idea for the acronym.

If we do do this, we should probably have an informal rule not to post an idea unless a previous request for it has turned up no results. Otherwise this'll just be full of normal fic requests.

...I'm going to break that informal rule now, mind; does anyone know a certain Simon Green book, Blood & Honor?

Spoiler alert if you haven't (but it was published in 1992, so...); there's a water-element magician, Dominic (I think that's his name), who has a spy in the camp of his brother, Prince Viktor. The way he maintains the loyalty of that spy is, he cut the spy with a lethal wound, and keeps it suppressed with his magic; if the spy doesn't return every day and remain loyal, Dominic just has to not renew the spell and the spy will bleed out.

I had an idea a while back where a group of dark wizards/witches use a similar method to force people to obey them; cut out something vital (like their victim's lungs or heart or whatever), use a secret spell to create a temporary renewable replacement for it, boom, they can make their victim die instantly if they disobey or run away.

Part of the idea was that as a countermeasure, wizards and witches who fell victim to this magic could transfigure themselves into forms that didn't have the injuries; in other words, animagi. If one practice becomes widespread (used by Voldemort or the wizard mafia or whatever), so does the other.

The only problem is that canon-wise, injuries in one form carry over to the other for animagi...

...Well, also that while it's an interesting-ish worldbuilding concept, I don't actually know what kind of story could be told about it.
