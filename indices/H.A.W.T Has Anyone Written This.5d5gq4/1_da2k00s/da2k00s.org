I would like to see Snape sent back in time but fate is a bitch and sends an angry Lily Potter back too who is less than impressed with his behaviour and attitude for the last twenty years. Snape wishes he had chosen Lily over the death eater but now lily hates him more than ever. Armed with knowledge of the future how do they work together to stop Voldemort, does Snape (if you see Snaps in this post blame autocorrect) even want to? What if James was more pragmatic than Lily and forgave him in the afterlife but Lily didn't. How does Lily get her future husband to grow up faster, did they really date a year before being engaged or had something been going on before they went public that not even Sirius and co. Knew? How does Lily react to Dumbledore after what he put her child through, how do they react to peter? Does anything happen or do they have to wait for Harry and the prophecy to come into play? Does she tell new James? Does she get to use resurrection stone to speak to old James? Did fate send her back or was it a joint decision between her and James to stop Snape trying to get Lily and ignore the horrid things he's done and the happiness James brought into her life?

I would love someone to write this and would be fine with it completely redeeming Snape but the idea of snape/lily makes me ill.
