Something I'm currently outlining, but never really got going was a spacetravel fic. And not like Starship Hedwig stuff, but genuine wizarding spacetravel with undertones of making Mars a Wizard planet and stuff like that.

I even got a scene where NASA goes batshit crazy because they find a wizarding air-dome on Mars and think its aliens building a colony.
