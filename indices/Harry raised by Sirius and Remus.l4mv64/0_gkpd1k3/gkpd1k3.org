These are the best two that ive read. Both are Wolfstar if thats ok?

linkao3(Stealing Harry) - This is probably the best one? It's a whole universe where the two rescue/adopt Harry from the Dursleys. It's adorable. There are a lot of side stories that go with it as well which makes it much bigger. I think the series is called Laocoons Children.

linkao3(The Dogfather) is also adorable. Goes right through till PS which is nice. Harry is adopted by a nice couple and they end up with a dog and it's overall a great feel good story where everything is just happy you know!!
