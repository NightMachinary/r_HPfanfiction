Hogwarts was very unhappy with its inhabitants at the moment, more than a few this time, one of them was a teacher, only in title mind you, Hogwarts would never consider her part of its faculty, it /refused/ too, even the portrait addicted man was better.

She had the gall to /torture/ children, in her halls, to hurt them and make them bleed because of her bigotry. Hogwarts remembered her when she was a student, she was already bad, but Hogwarts would never wager she would ever want or be /allowed/ to teach.

Hogwarts couldn't intervene directly with the Pink woman, oh, how it wished it could vanish the ground beneath her and bury her in the tunnels beneath, or seal her in a room until she starved. But it couldn't, the Four had placed limitations and then Emrys had reinforced them when he reinforced the wards.

But a thousand years had taught Hogwarts other ways, ways to guide it's students and faculty and assist them, not unlike a teacher should, though an unseen one.

It was always a Trio, ever since before Hogwarts, Salazar, Godric, Helga, with Rowena who always valued knowledge more than teaching and saw Hogwarts more as a tool than a school, thus being an outsider. Then Merlin, Arthur and Guinevere, heroes all, wizards all of them, even if history forgot it, and now, Harry, Ronald and Hermione, and Hogwarts had always suspected they were the same people with different faces, there was always a tell, they always found each other. Why, this time even Morgana had followed them, though she was named after Guinevere, how fun.

But Hogwarts wasn't without its resources, the Pink One always got the longest ways, the worst beds, the smelliest and broken bathrooms, Hogwarts even managed to make her trip the stairs sometimes, though it couldn't stop the cushioning charms from activating, as always.

Hogwarts had intervened so in the past, it had done it's best to prevent the Serpent King from killing a student, it had delayed the possessed one so Hogwarts' Trio could stop him, it had even delayed the rat-that-wasn't-a-rat but he knew its halls too well.

It was always the small things, the noises to call the faculty when one student thought to force themselves on another, the offered places to hide when one needed to escape cruel children or when they just needed to be alone, and paths to guide them towards friends when they shouldn't.

Hogwarts was not perfect, it failed sometimes, but there were more victories than defeats.

And now it once again was using its Trio to help the students, Harry was suffering and Hogwarts had had enough. It had taken three weeks, but Hermione had finally been able to collect the evidence to convict the Pink One, good. And now the Pink One was trying to hide it, how helpful were the doors not opening, her desk drawer with Quills being warded shut.

Now the Pink One was running, how careless of her to not see the floor tile that just lowered a few centimeters, that's going to bruise, ah, they got her, she's pulling her wand? Well, that suit of armor needed some polish anyway. There, arrested. Now the Headmaster would be able to hire a semi-competent teacher, Hogwarts missed the werewolf boy, he and his friends(minus the rat) were among its favorites, that's why it allowed the Map to work.

And now back to the usual routine, one of Hogwarts' favorite pastimes, Ronald was finally noticing Hermione, which was good, and Harry was talking to Ronald's sister, but Hogwarts knew he actually loved the blond one from Salazar's House, who Hogwarts strongly suspected was Nimueh, and thus should be with Harry since now there was no need for hiding a sword in the lake( and that's why Hogwarts shuffled the stairs two years ago and left them stuck in the third floor for an hour).

Now, all it needed to happen was for the Greasy One to send both to detention(so easy to manipulate cauldron fires in the Dungeons), a little shuffling of the stairs and corridors, and one of its favorite couples would be reunited properly.

Hogwarts was happy again.

PS: Hogwarts may or may not be imagining all the reincarnation stuff, it just sees patterns and associates them. It also has a thing for difficult romances.

I like this prompt, it totally fits in with the trope of magic absorbing the intents and wills of the people that live in a place.

Hogwarts has been a school for more than a thousand years, through which I like to believe the majority of teachers and students had good intent in being there, teach the children, protect the children, learn, love, have fun.

Over time this was absorbed by the castle and thus it follows this will of 40 generations of people.
