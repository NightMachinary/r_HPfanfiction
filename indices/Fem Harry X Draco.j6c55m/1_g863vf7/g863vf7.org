This is fem!harry x Draco but it's AU. linkffn(8519173).

This is Harriet Potter and the Minister of Magic. Basically Lily dies and James' Minister. He can be a better father I guess. Not much of a slow burn but a few chapters where you just wish they would get together already. She's a pretty good author with a bunch with the same pairing. I hope you check it out! Let me know if you like it!
