I can tell you right now that the first stuff I wrote was really, really bad. Like, awful. It was a Haruhi Suzumiya fanfiction and it suuuuuucckkkkkeeeeddddd. Whenever I go back and read it, my eyes bleed a little.

The next story I wrote was a Mass Effect story that was pretty awful. It was hella long and but the first part was a canon retred and the last part was a confusing jumbled mess.

Then, I wrote a story that was OK. I go back and I see problems with it, but it's alright.

I took a break, then wrote some HP stuff. Some of it is good, some of it is bad, but it's improved. My lastest stuff is easily better by miles than what I wrote last year though.

My point is, keep writing. The first 100k words you write will be terrible. The next 100k will be bad, but improving. By the time you've written 500k or more words, you'll be light years better than where you started.
