When I started writing (it was a Starcraft fic, iirc. There were clones, and spaceships, and dragons, and also Captain Picard) I wrote longhand, in pencil (even though I never erased anything).

Switching to typing on a PC has made definite changes to my writing style - I write much faster, but my beta has commented on my 'spare' style, when I used to have a Tolkienesque love of description.

So I took up handwriting again, and then typing it over, and I do believe that my writing is much, much better now. I've found a balance between the description-heavy purple prose I wrote between eleven and seventeen, and the minimalist style I adopted once I started writing on a computer.

The thing about writing by hand is that it can be done anywhere, and you have time to think while you're doing it. Unlike typing, which i find often goes too fast for me to properly register what I'm doing. Which leads to ungood writing.

The other thing is that when you're writing by hand with the intent to publish online, you're basically forcing yourself to reread. There's no way to get the work online without reading through it and typing it up, which gives you a fantastic opportunity to edit as you go - the first draft on your computer will actually be your second draft.

You've mentioned that you read fanfic, so I know you can recognize shit writing when you come across it. When you come across a bit of your own work that is perhaps not as good as you'd like, doing the work by hand means that instead of having to /delete entire paragraphs/ (which is disheartening and depressing and other things ending in D) you can just change it as you type.
