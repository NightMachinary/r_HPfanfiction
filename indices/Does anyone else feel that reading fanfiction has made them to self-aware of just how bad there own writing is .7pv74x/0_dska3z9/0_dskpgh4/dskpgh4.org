I wish I could somehow inform everyone everywhere that wants to write that editing is where good writing is made. First editing passes aren't about polish, they're about making sense of things. It doesn't take magical divining or inborn talent to do either. All it takes is the time to sit down, read the story, and decide what is working and what isn't. Literally anyone can do it with enough time.

Honestly, in my experience the two most difficult things about writing are getting started on a blank page and cutting scenes that are awesome but don't fit the story.

@OP: Remember, no one is judging your writing until you show it to them. When you read anything, you don't see the struggle they went through to get there. Trust me, the struggle is real.
