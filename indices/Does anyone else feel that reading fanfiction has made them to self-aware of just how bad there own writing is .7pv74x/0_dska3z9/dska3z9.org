The fact that you're going to edit it and rewrite it later should be enough to get you not to think twice about your writing in the moment. There's not really much else to it except sitting down and letting it all out. Get in the right atmosphere: coffee shop, desk at home, with a cup of tea, wherever you write best and just write. There are also apps that basically you can't stop writing because then all your work gets deleted. Too scared to try it myself, but it mght interest you. Just remember that no one's first draft is anywhere near good, much less ready to publish.
