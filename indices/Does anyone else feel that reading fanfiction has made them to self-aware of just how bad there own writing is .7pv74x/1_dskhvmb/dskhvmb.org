No first draft is perfect! Give yourself permission to write 'crap'. Just write. Your only enemy is a blank piece of paper (virtual or otherwise)! - Worry about the quality only after you're finished with the chapter/story. Polishing it and making it readable, that's was the editing process is for. A beta might help as well. Don't give up! You already know that the key to improving your writing is to keep on writing! - Good luck! :)
