Vekin87's Albus Potter series really captured the feel of the original series to me (and a lot of other recommenders). It's a little shaky at first but it gets way better as the series goes on.

OP might also like Victoria Potter, although this is a sort of approach to making canon a bit more complex (not realistic, per se, but expanding the story and the Wizarding World). Victoria is quite different than Harry, and Hermione isn't sympathetically written so far, but it's one of the best fics updating right now so I'd recommend checking it out.
