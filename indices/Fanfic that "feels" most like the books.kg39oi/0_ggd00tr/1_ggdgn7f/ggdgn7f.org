I will stan Alexandra Quick relentlessly on this sub, but for me it was quite different from the books.

AQ features some of the best friendships in fanfiction, but it isn't a fic about friendship the way canon is. The morality is also extremely different - AQ is extremely gray and has several sympathetic characters who you could call terrorists, whereas HP is pretty explicitly black and white. The AQ series features strong language, underage sex, and graphic violence (all in a very literary mold), nothing especially severe in terms of fanfic at large but much more than in canon. The high-class British world of canon vs the Americana of AQ is also really different.
