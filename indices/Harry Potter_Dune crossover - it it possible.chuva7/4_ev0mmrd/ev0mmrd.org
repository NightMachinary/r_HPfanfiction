I do not think it is possible in a way that does justice to both source materials.

1. One is about power and survival, the other about love and sacrifice. It's Nietzsche and Jesus. Not compatible without compromise.
2. Harry Potter would be dead within five minutes, as would every other character from the wizarding world in the Dune universe. A wand doesn't help you if you don't see you enemies coming, especially if you don't know who the enemy is. They are too naive and don't understand politics.
3. Pretty much every character in the Dune books would be capable of taking over the Wizarding world within a month of arriving in Diagon Ally.
4. The Kwisatz Hadderach is ridiculously overpowered.
