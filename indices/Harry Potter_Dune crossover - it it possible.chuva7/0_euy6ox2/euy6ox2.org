I think it's a fascinating idea. I've seen other HP fanfics set in a space faring future, so it's certainly not beyond the realm of possibility. Personally, I'd enjoy reading that kind of crossover.

I wonder how wizards and witches would have fared in the wake of the Butlerian Jihad. Would the Bene Gesseret breeding program be an attempt to restore magical ability to human beings? Do Mentats gain their prodigious mental abilities from practicing occlumency? Perhaps /melange/ allows humans to temporarilly tap into their latent magical genes.

I think any melding of the Harry Potter and Dune universes would require a lot of intense world building, but it could make for an excellent story.
