Ron (accidentally) becomes a Dark Lord in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/686093/Rorschach-s-Blot][Roschach's Blot]]'s fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3695087/1/Larceny-Lechery-and-Luna-Lovegood][Larceny, Lechery and Luna Lovegood]], complete with a large collection of adoring (female) followers. Molly gets very happy at the thought of all the potential grandchildren that she will get to spoil in the future.

Oh, Harry and Hermione also become thieves, continuing Harry's family legacy. And Luna keeps trying to set things up so that she can be /stolen/ by them.

And it turns out that in the ranks of the Aurors, there's a tentacle monster named Tim.

Yep, it's crack, but glorious crack.
