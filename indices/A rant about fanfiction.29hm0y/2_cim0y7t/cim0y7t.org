If I'm reading you correctly, you want the narrator's voice to be a neutral one, and any biases in the work to be shown through events and characters' voices. If it's trying to convince you that Snape's a bastard, it will show you that Snape's a bastard.

But it would be a crappy story if it just went through Snape being bastardly to everyone, so you want the main point of the story to be being a good story. You don't want to be beaten over the head with the idea.

Is that accurate?
