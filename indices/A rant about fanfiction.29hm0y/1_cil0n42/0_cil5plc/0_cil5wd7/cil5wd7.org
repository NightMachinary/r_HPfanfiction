By filtering, I also refer to the intuitive reliance on word of mouth, and recommendations, not just the technical filters.

You also occasionally watch bad movies or read bad novels, but most people still have enough experience with being an informed audience member, not to blindly wander into the first bookstore and buy the first book their arm reaches.

With fanfic, they seem to lack most of that, and judge the format by it's /average/ rather than by it's top.
