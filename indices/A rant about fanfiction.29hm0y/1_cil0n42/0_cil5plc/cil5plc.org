While filters can help narrow your search to features you tend to enjoy, there really is no way to search for quality other than trial and error. Popularity is absolutely no guarantee of quality and vice versa. You kind of have to wade through the random crap to find the stuff that's worth reading. For me the important thing has been to learn when to just /stop reading/ because the fic isn't worth my time. I often used to feel like I needed to finish a fic once I'd put in a certain amount of reading.
