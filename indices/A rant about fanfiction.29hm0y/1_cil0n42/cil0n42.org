Authors have "an agenda" to push. That seems to be a main point of literature itself, beyond providing short term amusement. With a less menacing terminology, it might also be described as "the message" of a story.

This is true for original fiction as well. /Animal Farm/ has an agenda. /The Aeneid/ has an agenda. /The Chronicles of Narnia/ has an agenda. /Wide Sargasso Sea/ has an agenda.

Note, that two of the four above named works are traditionally not called "fanfiction", yet they still contain pre-existing settings and characters. The focus on expecting "original" franchise-building is entirely the product of modern, ultra-commercialized pop culure.

So yes, /Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/ has an agenda, and /Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness/ has an agenda, and /Harry Potter and the Natural 20/ has an agenda, whatever, they fit right into the picture.

That many of them are doing it terribly, has more to do with the fact that we are talking about a format where millions of random people are uploading texts to the same archives, than with the inherent nature of fanfiction. Your problem is either with reading too much random crap (and feeling obliged to read the daily newest uploads after running out of the most recommended classics), or with not reading enough (and being utterly unskilled at filtering them by popularity and quality).
