I see what you mean, but isn't that the whole point of a fanfiction? The author tells the story his/her way. I dont think that most authors write for the audience as such, many just write to have a creative outlet or because they simply enjoy it. Thats why theres such a wide variety around. Some people hate Ron whilst others love him. Is it wrong of the author to force his opinion down your throat? Well no not really since the author is the one who seed blood, sweat and tears bringing that fanfic alive.
