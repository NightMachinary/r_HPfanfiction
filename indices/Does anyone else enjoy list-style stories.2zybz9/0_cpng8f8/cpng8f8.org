[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3255466/1/The-List][The List]] is pretty great.

In my own head, though, whenever I think of a list-style story it's something like this:

*Harry inherits ten billion Galleons

*Harry becomes Earl of Southwick

*Harry kills TMR with a casual flick of his fingers

*Harry establishes a harem with every female character in canon

Your idea is /much/ better.
