Good lord, I need this in my life. So many Harry Potter fics are mundane in nature. Stuff about racism and politics, while it can be done well (though it often isn't), is incredibly boring. Especially when everyone's doing it. There's room for so much wonder in that world and all we ever see is op lord potter politicking.
