I don't know if this is up your alley, but I would recommend the [[http://www.jamespotterseries.com/][James Potter series]], by George Norman Lippert. They're written in a very similar style to that of Rowling, so they become quite easy to read and immerse yourself in them. The books were even endorsed by Rowling herself. There's a total of 5 main books, and 2 "spinoffs" that elaborate a little more some of the character backgrounds. Yeah, you read that right, novel-length books. They can be found in several places if you google them, including the author's site that I just linked in this post.

Good luck with your search.
