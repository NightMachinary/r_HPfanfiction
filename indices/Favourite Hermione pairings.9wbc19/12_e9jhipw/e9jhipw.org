I like Ron/Hermione's dynamic and development in the books - how they're opposites in some ways that balance each other out, and enjoy each other's company (once misunderstandings are cleared up).

I also like Harry/Ron/Hermione, since that dynamic is the core of the story.

I think Hermione/Luna is interesting, since their methods of thinking contrast so much, and there's benefits to Luna's open-mindedness and Hermione's logic. I've read some cute shorter fics (for example [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5016523][this]]), and would like to see development to what could make this pairing really work. Unfortunately, Luna is an incredibly hard character to write correctly.
