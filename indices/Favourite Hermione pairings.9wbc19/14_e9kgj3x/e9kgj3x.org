Snape Snape Severus Snape

I know.. Downvote me into oblivion. I love this pairing because they are usually a slow burn with Hermione being challenged intellectually.

They are both similar in intelligence, fierce loyalty to the people they care about, and a certain single-mindedness/bossy. I often wonder if Severus saw himself in Hermione (smart, bossy, victimized by purebloods,etc) when she was a student and that's why he disliked her.

I also think I see myself in Hermione quite a bit which makes me turned off of Harry and Ron who seem far too immature for her.

I know the age gap and Snape's previous motivations come into play, but for me that's what makes them a compelling read. I don't like people who are perfectly matched. I like characters that work together but not before doing some ground work. I think anything done when Hermione was younger than 18 however is gross.

But that's just me.
