Clearly, the correct answer here is Hermione/Cormac OTP.

On a more serious note, I see following matches as plausible:

- Harry (I find this much more plausible than any other pairing, actually -- the only 2 other pairings I've seen done well without anyone being OOC requires major canon divergence)
- Marauder-era OR post-war Severus (I see the pairing as implausible during the entire second war, even if it would last longer than it did, because the student/teacher relationship isn't the only issue here, but also his vow to protect Harry to honor Lily's memory. I can't see Severus willing to let anyone inside his personal space, and I can see him "fear" getting over Lily compromising his mission in the war. Once the war is over, this is no longer an issue, and he should be able to get closure to that point of his life)
- Marauder-era Remus (Without time displacement, Remus already has someone else which is arguably a better match -- Tonks)

I see these common matches as /implausible/:

- Ron (They have a tendency to bring out the worst in each other, and their personalities clashes a lot. Hell, I'd see this as outright incompatible, not just implausible, if not for the Golden Trio. Consider what would have happened if the Troll incident never took place)
- Draco (They spent the vast majority of the school years despising each other, Hermione seeing Draco as a bigoted narcissist, and Draco seeing Hermione as an annoying mudblood upstart. Even if he got better after Hogwarts, there's too much history there)

There's also Krum, but his character is almost a blank slate beyond "he goes to Durmstrang, he's a professional Quidditch player", so I can't really judge that pairing. That being said, my gut feeling says implausible, even if he happens to be a good match, due to the whole "different country" business.
