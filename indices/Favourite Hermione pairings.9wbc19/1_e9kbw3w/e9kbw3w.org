Wasn't there just another thread about this topic? Anyway, preparing for downvotes but... Harry.

Now, hear me out. Realistically, Hermione is most likely going to end up with either Harry or Ron. I think Neville also would be a good match for her (I don't ship it but he's also someone who's struggled with self esteem issues but like Hermione has a passion for education later in his life) and honestly, I've never thought it right that Ron be The One for her. Them dating for a while is one thing, perfectly logical and even likely to happen, really, if Harry doesn't make any moves, but as others have pointed out they have nothing in common and the basis of their relationship is they are friends with the same guy and argue with one another frequently. That's not a good foundation for a long, happy partnership. Rowling herself said that they were put together due to wish fulfillment from her original idea before she even started the series, and that realistically the two of them would likely need counseling to be happy with one another, if at all.

Now, with that out of the way, why Harry? Simple. Because they fit. They're not each other's perfect, ideal partners, but I think they work out better for it. Ginny became a cookie cutter caricature for everything Harry could look for in a woman until that was all that was left of her. Harry and Hermione have plenty in common with a healthy amount of meaningful differences that can fuel a nice, reasonable, romantic dynamic. They were both raised as muggles. Both were bullied frequently before they came to Hogwarts, and both still suffered a bit of it even after they arrived. Hermione likes her schoolwork, and Harry does too, though it's often subverted by other things (it's not given much attention, but there are several passages in the books that show that Harry enjoyed his school books and would try to get summer homework done early). However, Hermione cares more about doing everything perfectly while a Harry is content with doing it well enough. Both are hard workers but with different goals. Hermione is passionate about social change while Harry is more likely to accept the norms, though he'll fight against what he thinks is unjust.

More than anything, though, I like them together because of who they are to each other. Hermione is the one person who has always been there for Harry, even when Ron wasn't. Likewise, Harry has always been there for Hermione. They're not each other's ideal partners and likely wouldn't ever associate with one another if the world wasn't the way it was, but because it is that way they've been through so much together, overcoming such obstacles and tribulations until they have become true partners. As Emma Watson said, they're equals. They get each other. There's several points in the books where Hermione is the only one who notices something going on with Harry, or is the only one to do anything about it. They've fought, but even in the one notable fight they had (before the DoM) it was still laden with an undercurrent of respect and concern for one another, unlike Hermione's fights with Ron which are usually just contradiction or insults.

There's also just so many moments in the books that, despite Rowling planning for them to be with other people, come out as easily more romantic and heartfelt than any of the actual romance-purposed scenes. (Im looking at you, wedding “I pronounce you bonded for life” scene). Hermione is the first one since his parents to show Harry signs of physical affection. She's his first hug, his first kiss on the cheek(!) and is always embracing him or in some instances holding his hand. Everyone around them thinks they already have something for one another, from Dumbledore to Cho and Viktor to even freaking Ron. Rowling herself said that she felt intense moments between Harry and Hermione when writing them in DH. It's my opinion that, we're it up to her muse and not her plans, Harry would have ended up with Hermione, and the two would be all the better for it.
