Are we assuming this is 4th year and up Hermione?

First choice would be Ron. Not his fault Hermione put herself squarely in the friendzone and was struggling to get out of the hole she dug herself.

Second choice would be Harry, because honestly who's left that Hermione

Last choice would be OC. Because thats what Lucious, Draco, Snape, and Voldemort would turn out to be. And is very much the side effect of "Badboy syndrome, I can fix him" in the case of Draco and "Powerful, Dominant/Confidant Older man" in all the rest of the examples both of which is nauesating. Krum would fall into the latter as a mixture of both. Young enough to be considered a badboy and old enough to be seen as a powerful (as youngest proffesional seeker ever, IIRC).

Time travel shenanigans would include Remus, Sirius, James, Pettigrew, and Snape.

None of which work unless you want to turn Hermione into an expy of Lily. Which would work with James, probably intrigued by someone so similiar. Not at all with Sirius who that James was nutters with that infatuation in the first place. Remus has a werewolf problem, and, as a teenager has every right to not get into a romantic entanglement until said person is an animagus. Pettigrew is a coward and follower and Hermione has never liked weak guys in the first place considering who she hangs with on a day to day basis. Snape had too much of the wrong pride and would end any sort of relationship the same way he did Lily. Badly. And if you've read the books again at any point one would know that Hermione holds vicious grudges and doesn't forget.

So if Hr is the main love interest/protaganist/POV I read H/Hr or Ron/Hr and everything else gets skipped over.
