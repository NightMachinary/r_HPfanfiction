I'd argue that a Ron pairing would work out if they meet when they are 20. Ron gets his shit together for the most part (if you ignore the time he mind raped his driving instructor).

The issue with canon as it is that there would be simply too much water under the bridge, too many memories of Ron acting hurtful (because that's what he does for the first five and a half books, with one exception).
