Harry.

I just can't see Ron growing up enough to be with Hermione. Because of their friendship I think that she could eventually forgive him for his abandonment during the Hunt, but I'm not sure their romance would last long because of all the arguing and the lack of anything in common. Seriously, what do they have in common? Harry seems to be the only answer. Hermione is a bookwork who loves to study and work hard and has a lot of ambition that she is willing to actually fight for. Ron is a quidditch obsessed, lazy boy who, though he has ambition, is unwilling to work hard. She's obscenely loyal, while he runs when the going gets tough. And outside of the first and sixth books (Troll incident and the DA) do we ever actually see Ron cast a spell? I'm not entirely sure he knows how.

Harry on the other hand makes a lot of sense. Though he's not studious, he can focus when he has to. He's loyal, though he did go along with Ron way too much. He and Hermione were together through most of the adventures where Ron sat on the sidelines (book 1 after the chess, book three time turner, book four she was the only one there to help in train, book seven where he ran off and she stayed and saved Harry's ass several times).

The only other from canon that I think would work is Neville. He's brave, is apparently studious in later years and becomes a powerful wizard who stands up for what he believes in. I see Neville and Harry being basically the same, so I think really either could work.

Draco doesn't work for me at all, even though most of the fandom seems to disagree with me. I don't see how he can be redeemed, and even if that's possible, how can Hermione forgive him for how he's treated her throughout the entire series.
