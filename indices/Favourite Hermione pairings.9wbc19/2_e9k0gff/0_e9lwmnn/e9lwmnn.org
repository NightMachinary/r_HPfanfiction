IMO, Draco only works if several years later he became a truly good person trying to atone for his past. Even then, there's likely too much bad history between them for them to ever become more than friends, if even that.

I always saw Ron/Hermione as an awkward pairing. Sure, you sometimes hear "opposites attract", but I never really put much faith in that saying. I have no real opinion on Harmony -- I don't see it as implausible, though.
