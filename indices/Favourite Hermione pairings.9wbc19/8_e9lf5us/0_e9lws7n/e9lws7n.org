In regards to Marauder-age HG pairings, why Sirius? I can see Hermione/Remus (if she can get past Remus' werewolf insecurity, allthough this is certainly the easier match) or Hermione/Severus (if she can get past his feelings for a certain redhead, or end up early enough before said feelings develop, and resist his cutting remarks enough until she gets past his prickly outer shields), but Sirius? Yeah, I can see Sirius flirt with Hermione... just like he does with everyone else, but nothing longterm. Not trying to flame you or anything, just genuinely curious. Perhaps I just haven't read fics that makes the pairing look feasible.

In any case, I only see them as plausible in first place if it happens several years after the war (Severus only), or if she is thrown into the past, to normalize the age difference (There's a 20-year difference here!). Yeah, over time as I see weird pairings in fanfics, age for me when reading them matter less and less, but objectively, a 20-year difference does not really help anyone in terms of plausible matches.
