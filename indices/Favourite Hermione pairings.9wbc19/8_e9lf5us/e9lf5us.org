Hermione truly is the Little Black Dress of Harry Potter fandom; you could make an argument for just about anyone (except Ron, strangely, IMO ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è).

‚Äã

Hermione seems like the kind of girl that might initially like dating a guy that isn't at smart or ambitious as her so she could feel extra super great about herself but she'd get over it in the long run. Hence why neither Ron nor Neville would ever work (unless they changed a lot). I could see an argument for Harry in the later books, though I find the pairing a bit boring.

‚Äã

Percy/Hermione would be an insufferable power couple. They would bring out and support all of each others' worst qualities - bossy, priggish, etc. Actually, I think I'd like to read this now.

‚Äã

I admit, I like her with Snape (or Sirius or Lupin, I suppose). That girl likes a cause; I could see her being into intelligent but broken men. Not that it would necessarily be the healthiest relationship but I could see it working.

(Also, I fully admit, imaging Snape as Alan Rickman creeps me out. I can only imagine Snape as, like, an ugly Tom Hiddleston-playing-Loki. But then, basically every actor from the movie is not exactly lustworthy so that's a whole other issue (I mean, Kenneth Branagh at the heart throb of the Wizarding world? Really??)).

I realize I'm in the minority with these pairings. But then, I like reading slow-developing fiction involving moral relativism, gray areas, darker storylines, and emotional arcs that aren't clear cut or necessarily ‚Äúright‚Äù.
