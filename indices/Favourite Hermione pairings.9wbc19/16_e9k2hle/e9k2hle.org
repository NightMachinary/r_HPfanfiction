I'd like to see a good Hermione/Percy, set when she is in her early-twenties, or perhaps a bit older. The age gap of four years is not problematic then, and it could be closer to three and a half years because we know Hermione turned twelve soon after starting her first year at Hogwarts.

I think Percy could have a very interesting redemptive arc, and he and Hermione have many things in common. They'd fit together fairly well, and it would be interesting to see how their work at the Ministry could change from allies to opponents depending on the issue. Could make for some fascinating dramatic tension.
