Gorgon would make a ton of sense because from what I remember Athena carried a lot of guilt surrounding the events of Medusa in the story at least. I was pretty sure the pendant or amulet or whatever itself was snake like and Harry had like a connection to it through him speaking parseltongue. Anyway thanks for helping maybe one day I'll find it. I'm pretty positive though maybe the guy took it down sadly.
