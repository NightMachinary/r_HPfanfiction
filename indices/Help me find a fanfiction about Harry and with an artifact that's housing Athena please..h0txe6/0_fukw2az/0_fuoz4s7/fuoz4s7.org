Thanks for trying anyway at least, it's not the most popular fic so makes sense it wouldn't be to noteworthy. And it definitely was series since the guy got all the way through to fifth year at least without notable time skips. Not really to sure about the wolves to be honest but probably Harry in that fic was kind of a bad ass so he probably picked a fight with them at some point. Thanks again for trying.
