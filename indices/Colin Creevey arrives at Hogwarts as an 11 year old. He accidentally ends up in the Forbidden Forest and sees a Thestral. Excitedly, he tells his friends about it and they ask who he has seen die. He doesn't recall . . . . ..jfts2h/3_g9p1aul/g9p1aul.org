When an excited Dennis plead to his big brother that show him some magic stuff, Colin levitated him, but get distracted and let him fall and broke his neck.

Terrified, accidentally banished his body.

(Colin recall perfectly, but is lying everybody)

EDITED: I decided that was too sad. I prefer that Colin and Dennis killed someone together.
