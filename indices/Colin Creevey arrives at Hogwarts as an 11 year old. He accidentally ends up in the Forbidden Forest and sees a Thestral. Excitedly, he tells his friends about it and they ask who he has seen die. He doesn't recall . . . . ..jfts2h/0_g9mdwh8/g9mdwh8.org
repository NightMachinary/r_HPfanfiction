Interesting idea, but that'd bring to question, why Harry didn't see the Thestrals, when he was in second year, since he saw his parents, or at least, his mother, die?

I know it's a prompt, and it's a interesting one, but just a thought, that I had.

Mhm... maybe because the ScarHorcrux blocked out the memory, or something? idk.
