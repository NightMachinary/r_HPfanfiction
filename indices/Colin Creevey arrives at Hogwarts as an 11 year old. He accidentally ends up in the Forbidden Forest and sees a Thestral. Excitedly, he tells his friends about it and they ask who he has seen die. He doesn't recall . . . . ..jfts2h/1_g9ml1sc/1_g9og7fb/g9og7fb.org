I read a fic once (can't recall the title or author, sadly) in which it's standard practice for the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad to Obliviate everyone involved in an incident, including Muggleborn children and their families. Repeated memory erasure has long-term effects on someone, especially during their formative years: Colin photographs everything because some part of him feels the need to store memories somewhere less vulnerable than his head. Hermione obsessively hoards knowledge, forever trying and failing to find whatever it is that she /knows/ she should know but doesn't.
