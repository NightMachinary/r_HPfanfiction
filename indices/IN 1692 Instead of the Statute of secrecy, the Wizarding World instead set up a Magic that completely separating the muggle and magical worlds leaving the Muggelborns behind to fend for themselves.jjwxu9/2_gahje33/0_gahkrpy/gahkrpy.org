The way I was thinking about it the magical world would take everything magical with them with them going it threw a global spell so there would be no old magic to find and the only magical creatures and plants would be tha animal equivalents of muggleborns.

So the magical world would be shifting everything magical to a empty parallel version of earth. So magic would be coming back from the ground up threw new muggleborns, that were born after the event.
