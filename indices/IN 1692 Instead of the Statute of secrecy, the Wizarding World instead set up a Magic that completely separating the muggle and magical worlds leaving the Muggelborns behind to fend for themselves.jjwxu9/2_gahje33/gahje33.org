*Its an interesting idea, here's my take:*

The old wizards are gone, no one knows where, but its pretty clear they are not coming back. There are a lot of stories about the lost wizarding golden age, how they could pull memories from your mind, secrets from your tongue, cross the world in an instant and even command time itself.

Most people don't believe any of this, the mages of today certainly can't manage anything that impressive.

Muggles know all about magic, dragons and trolls are hard to miss. That being said, its a background aspect of the world and everything looks more or less the same as it does in our world. The magic is there, but it doesn't affect most peoples lives.

You might be trying to keep your bird feeder safe from gnomes instead of squirrels and when you go into the woods you need to be aware of devils snare instead of bear attack and the government has a department responsible for keeping the dragon population under control and putting down the ones that gain a taste for human flesh.\\
But, at the end of the day, most people are still doing the same jobs, have the same hobbies, and live basically the lives you would expect.

There are mages too, people born with an ability to work magic. It can be a nice advantage in life, like being very smart, but it doesn't guarantee success or make you superhuman. Also, it takes a lot of work to be able to do anything truly remarkable and most people with magic lack the opportunities or simply aren't driven enough to put in the work.

Being a mage can also cause problems, magic is an unruly and chaotic thing and if you lose control over it it can cause all kinds of trouble.

Then you have Hogwarts, an ancient place of power, steeped in tradition and overflowing with magic, the ancient castle has been an institution of magical learning since the times of the old wizards. It is a vast and sprawling castle built using old arts long lost, with enough secrets and mysteries within its walls to keep someone occupied for a thousand lifetimes.\\
Within its walls, mages and mundanes work together to unlock the secrets of the universe. At least in theory, in practice there is so much stuffy tradition, academic rivalry and mischief caused by errant magical forces it's amazing any work gets done.

The four great departments of Hogwarts are focused on the following topics:\\
Training new mages to control their powers.

Researching magic and trying to uncover the fundamental rules and secrets.

Melding the magical and the mundane together to create something greater.

Solving otherwise difficult problems of a magical nature in the wider world.
