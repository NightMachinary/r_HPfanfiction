Reminds me of this oneshot: linkffn(The Wall by CypressWand)

After Sirius' trip to the Veil, he ends up in an AU where Grindelwald and Dumbledore together arranged to completely split up the Wizards and the Muggles from each other, with a magical wall.

I was intrigued and slightly disappointed that it didn't go further than an oneshot.
