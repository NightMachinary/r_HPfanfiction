I would suppose that the Muggleborns would build their own community eventually. Could start out as some sort of X-Men organization, initially to protect each other from witch hunts and then to learn from each other how to manipulate their powers, but since magic is hereditary, eventually these people would have children, either with Muggles or amongst themselves.

The numbers in the books are inconsistent, with only two known Muggleborns and one with uncertain past out of fourty students in Harry's year. This would indicate that the number of Muggleborn population is very small compared to that of people from magical families. However in DH it's implied that Azkaban is full of Muggleborns, it's implied that Umbridge is really busy with interviewing Muggleborns and there is a large number of wandless on Diagon Alley.

Anyways, the point of the above paragraph was that it would be hard to say how big that community would get in 300 years and it's hard to say whether you would have people developing similar elitist attitudes to those of bloodpurists. I guess it depends on how big this community is and at what rate it's growing. If it would grow too fast, I assume that those coming from older families would start to despise the newer members of the community, but if it's fairly small, I can imagine it being more supportive.

Also, JK implies that Muggleborns were the more likely victims of Muggle persecution since people coming from magical families knew how to hide their powers so I can imagine that the anti-Muggle sentiment in this community would be quite strong.
