I Hate the Idea that Muggleborns had magical ancestors it just plays into the Pureblood narrative. and if All Muggleborns have magical ancestors were did the first muggleborns come from, their has to have been a first one, and if there can be a first one there can be a second and a third,ect.

and the Muggleborns left in the Muggle world would probably live similar lives to their muggle counterparts. and not in the post scarcity society of the magical world.
