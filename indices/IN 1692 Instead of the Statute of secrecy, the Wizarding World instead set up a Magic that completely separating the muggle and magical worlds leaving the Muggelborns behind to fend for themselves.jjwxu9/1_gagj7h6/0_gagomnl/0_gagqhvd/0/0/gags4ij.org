I'm only telling you what JK said. I have seen people who took into account Pottermore stuff as canon and other who didn't so it's up to you. Also with regards to my thoughts on magical origins, I think that wizards and muggles evolved together. Dumbledore says that "words are an inexhaustible source of magic" and thinks that love and sacrifice are the most powerful forms of magic. That would indicate that even muggles are capable of rudimentary forms of magic, since they refer to charm as a trait of someone that can make you feel good and refer to curses as words that cause revulsion and discomfort. The initial magic might have come from acts that we consider nowadays mundane such as women seducing men for protection or men using charisma to get other people to follow them (things that other animals are not capable of). Later they tamed and domesticated animals and some people had such a good predisposition to manipulating nature that they could protect or harm people and even influence weather through willpower, while others didn't. These were the first wizards and muggles, respectively.

Edit: that's my headcanon at least.
