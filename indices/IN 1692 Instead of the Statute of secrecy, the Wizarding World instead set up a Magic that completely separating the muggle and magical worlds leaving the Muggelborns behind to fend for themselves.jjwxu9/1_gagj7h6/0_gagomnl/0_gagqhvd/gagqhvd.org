Maybe but according to JK, Muggleborns also had magical ancestors so I think their gene is more predisposed to creating Squibs. Also, while the Weasleys have lots of children, most wizards in the series have only one or two siblings or they are an only child and also many wizards or witches choose not to marry or have children. So the increase would not really be exponential even if we assume that all the children born out of the initial Muggleborn community would have magical powers.
