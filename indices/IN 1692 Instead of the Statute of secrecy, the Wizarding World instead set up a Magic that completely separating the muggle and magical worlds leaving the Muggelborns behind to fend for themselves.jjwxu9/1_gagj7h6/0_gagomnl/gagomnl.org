One thing to keep in mind is that magic seems to be hereditary, and the dominant gene(magic probably has nothing to do with genes but you get the idea).

So once you stop romoveing the muggleborns from the muggle world I would expect it to multiple at a exponential rate over the generations.

So you have 2-3muggleborns per generation and each of those muggleborns will go on to have magical children like 7 each, because of magic those children are more likely to survive to procreate, so then you have the 14 kids of the first few muggleborns plus the three new muggle borns.

Mabye I am wrong but I feel like three hundred years if a lot of generation for the about of muggleborns and their decendants to multiply.
