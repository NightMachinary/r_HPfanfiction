Once muggle borns are no longer being taken out of the muggle world I think magic would spread at a exponential rate, in the uk lets set say there are 3 new muggle borns a year that is 924, being born between 1692 and the year 2000. Then you have to take into account their children, grandchildren and so on and so forth, after all from what we saw being magical is the dominant gene(I think magic has nothing to do with genes but you get what I mean).

The the original 3 muggleborns would have like 7 children each who would also have 7 children, with 3 new muggleborns being born each year.

Sure not all of them would survive, but accidental magic would make them more likly to survive than their muggle counterparts.
