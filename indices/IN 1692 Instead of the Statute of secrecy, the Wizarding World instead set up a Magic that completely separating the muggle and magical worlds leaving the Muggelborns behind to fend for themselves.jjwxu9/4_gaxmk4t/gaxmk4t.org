Honestly my first thought of what would happen would be a world of Super Heroes (and of course, Super Villians).

I personally head-canon that any person that can use a foci can also do the same magics without a foci, perhaps just taking more concentration or power if you want a limiting factor.

Of course, if all the new muggleborn aren't trained in their magic then they won't necessarily know what their power can do, they just know they can do somethings. For example, a muggleborn who learns that they can have a seeming telekinetic ability may not then think to try pyrokinetic abilities, because they 'know' that they're telekinetic.

This could go hand in hand with the idea of magical affinities, someone who would have had an affinity for transfiguration magics will more likely to be, say, a shapeshifter (whether that's through a natural metamorphmagus talent or through some sub-conscious self transfiguration, the effect would be similar if not the same), or someone with a natural affinity for herbology based magics might be able to make plants grow on demand. Most if not all of the typical super power traits could be ascribed to an affinity with a particular type of magic.

This could even explain the relative scarcity of super powered people compared to even the number of magicals that we think exist in the HP verse. After all even if anyone /can/ do wandless magic if they can do wanded magic, it's still hard to do. Only the most powerful or focused or determined individuals are likely to ever really claim the same sort of mastery over wandless magic compared to their wanded magic.\\
This means that most magicals in this world will the type of people who either have a very specific (and low level) ability: say a fortune teller or medium (divination affinity); or someone who has perfect aim; or someone who has better than average luck; and so on. Or they'll be people who perform a 'miracle' of some kind, like you can see in real news, say someone bending a car door out of shape to rescue someone from a car crash.

This way, you'd have a few dozen/hundred/thousand super powered individuals, coming from those with the most potential (be it power or focus or will power) matching up with a particular magical affinity.
