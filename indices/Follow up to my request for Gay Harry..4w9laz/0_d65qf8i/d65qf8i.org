I can't help with your actual request, but if you enjoyed Lack of Color you will probably love Aorist Subjunctive by Minisinoo. It's one of the best coming of age stories in the fandom.

That aside, i doubt scraping together the few little pieces of canon we have on Charlie would get you someone Harry is interested in. The only thing we really know about him is that he is /really/ obsessed with dragons and left Hogwarts after his 5th year to work with them. Harry dropped Care of magical Creatures on the first opportunity.. :)
