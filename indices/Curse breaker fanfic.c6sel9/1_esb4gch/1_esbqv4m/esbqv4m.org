What's the romance like in Secret of Atlantis.? I never read H/H because it seems out of character when writers try to put it in canon and there is too much Ron bashing. Most of The AUs I read have them as sibling-like so it doesn't come up. I know it was hinted at though in Tomb Raider so I was hesitant to try the sequel. If it's low key I might give it a shot though.
