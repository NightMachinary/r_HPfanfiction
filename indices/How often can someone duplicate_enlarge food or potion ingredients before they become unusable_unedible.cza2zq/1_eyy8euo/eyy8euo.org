It's important to remember that 90% of the potion ingredients we see in canon are just regular plants and animal parts - not from magical plants or creatures. I don't really see why there would be any difference between a newt's eye and a steak, when it comes to duplication/expansion.

The important thing to remember about duplication, however, is that you have a copy of the original as-is. Which means if you need something fresh, duplication isn't going to help you, because it replicates the age of the object you're copying. We saw this in DH when Hermione wasn't able to make fresh bread out of the mouldy bread they had.
