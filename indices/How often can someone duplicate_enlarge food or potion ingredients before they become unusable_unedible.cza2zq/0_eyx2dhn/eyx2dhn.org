There is no suggestion in canon that there is any upper limit to duplicating or enlarging food in particular, and it's hard to see /why/ there would be any, though in the case of enlargement, it's worth noting that Transfiguration of a tiny object into a larger one is harder than of one object to another one of equal size, so it's possible that the same principles would make /Engorgio/ exponentially harder to cast the bigger the intended result is compared to the original.

There is no canonical word concerning Potion ingredients, but the fact that there is a thriving market for Potion ingredients in the Wizarding World (whereas there aren't any wizard-only grocery stores... hmm...) suggests that while you might be able to duplicate or enlarge the /substance/, you can't duplicate magical energy using magic. Meaning that you could potentially, say, turn a drop of Basilisk Venom into gallons and gallons of the stuff, but those gallons and gallons would only contain as much magic as the original drop, diluted beyond use.
