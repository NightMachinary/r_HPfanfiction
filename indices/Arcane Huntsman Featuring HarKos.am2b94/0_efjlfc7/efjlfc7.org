Great! There isn't many good RWBY-HP crossovers.

  weapon choice seems bad, think its going to be pretty hard for him to use magic when he is running around with both sword and shield. Unless you randomly make his sword magic conductive? Though that just seems awkward.

Like [[/u/luminphoenix][u/luminphoenix]] pointed out, weapon choice is a little bit gross. After seeing Crescent Rose, Ember Celica and Gambol Shroud; a simple sword and shield seems lame to me. I am expecting an original weapon. A weapon that makes Ruby go ballistic -/'So this is your weapon? So cool! What is its name?'/
