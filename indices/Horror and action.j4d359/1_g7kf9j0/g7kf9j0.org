1) Elizium for the Sleepless Souls » The crumbling island prison of Azkaban has been evacuated, its remaining prisoners left behind. Time growing short, Harry Potter will make one final bid for freedom, enlisting an unlikely crew of allies in a daring escape, where nothing is as it seems. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7713063/1/Elizium-for-the-Sleepless-Souls]] Horror and action

2) The Eyes » Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see. (Definitely nail bitingly scary and mysterious with psychological elements) highly recommend it!

3) Quo Vadis? It is the greatest threat the world of magic has ever faced. It cannot be reasoned with. It cannot be bargained with. It cannot be hexed. It cannot be cursed. It cannot be stopped. It cannot be killed. And only Lord Voldemort stands in its way (oneshot that is very scary) [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5614134/1/Quo-Vadis]]

4) Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus The_Carnivorous_Muffin Summary: As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job. This story is a mix of things there is definitely Lovecraftian Horror elements, action, science fiction, existentialism, absurdism, action, murder, violence, and love so if you want to read a long and unique story with all these elements give it a try!
