Keep in mind the initial genre of HP: children's fiction. For this genre of action or adventure, the adults /must/ be incompetent. With incompetent adults, the children protagonists are given the ability to be the champions of the story. So with that in mind, Hogwarts teachers /have/ to be stretched thin with their responsibilities, adults /have/ to hold grudges against the children, and the figures of authority /have/ to dismiss the children's worries as childish.

I actually have a slice-of-life fic in development that addresses these problems to create a "realistic" Hogwarts set in 2010 - it'd be fun to compare notes! Some things I have added to my version of Hogwarts: more teachers, dedicated Heads of Houses, and Muggle Studies (and it's equivalent, actually named Magical Studies) is required for all years.
