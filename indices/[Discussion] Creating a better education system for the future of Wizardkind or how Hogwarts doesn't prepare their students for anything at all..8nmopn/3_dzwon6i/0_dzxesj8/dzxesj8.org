  Keep in mind the initial genre of HP: children's fiction. For this genre of action or adventure, the adults must be incompetent. With incompetent adults, the children protagonists are given the ability to be the champions of the story. So with that in mind, Hogwarts teachers have to be stretched thin with their responsibilities, adults have to hold grudges against the children, and the figures of authority have to dismiss the children's worries as childish.

  I actually have a slice-of-life fic in development that addresses these problems to create a "realistic" Hogwarts set in 2010 - it'd be fun to compare notes! Some things I have added to my version of Hogwarts: more teachers, dedicated Heads of Houses, and Muggle Studies (and it's equivalent, actually named Magical Studies) is required for all years.

I don't think this is limited to children's fiction. No one wants to read Harry Potter: The Wizarding World's First Health And Safety Inspector. The wizarding world having a more relaxed attitude towards danger than the (Western) Muggle one makes the world more interesting regardless of whether the intended audience is children or adults.
