I think you have misunderstood something about Harry Potter. Strip away the magic and the whimsy (you know, the stuff we assosciate with HP), and what are you left with? Seven boarding school mystery novels. The plot of every book more or less revolves around setting up these mysteries for Harry and Co. to solve/figure out/deal with. Why send Hagrid to pick up Harry? He would end up hinting about the Philosopher's Stone and not explain things unless asked, leaving Harry, and the readers, ignorant until its time to advance the overall plot. Most of your contentions can be boiled down to, "Rowling invented a lot of her system on the fly, introducing new plot points to resolve later parts of the story, even if they create problems with past or even future story points."

Now as for the school system. Yes, its poorly thought out and run by a man who has at best questionable educational ideas for children. But there are reasonable explanations that could fit with canon.

Why is Muggle Studies not important? Schools try to focus on information that is important to functioning within THEIR society, not others. Education in Britain does not necessarily prepare you to function in Tunisia. By all accounts the Wizarding world seems nearly isolated from the muggles, with entire wars going on without there notice. Contrast this Astronomy, which has importance for other magics like potions, herbology and divination, several of which are important for potential careers in their society.

Why only Hogwarts? Well, there is only 11 schools according to Rowling, and the global population is not that large. At one point JKR stated there were 3000 wizards/witches in Britain, and considering people like Dippet lived more than three centuries, this makes you wonder how many students actually go to Hogwarts (she stated 1000 one time, but that seems implausible).

Why not get rid of X teacher (take your pick)? How many people can do there jobs or are even qualified to do them? In defense of the DADA position, how many qualified people can there be who can actually teach that course decently. Hell, Dumbledore put the Muggle Studies professor (Quirrel) in, probably from lack of willing candidates. And again I refer you to my previous point about the population. Same deal with History of Magic being taught by a ghost.

Why do they tolerate such blatant favoritism? Probably tradition honestly. A lot of stupid things are maintained for centuries because its the way they did them in the past. Plus it theoretically encourages the students to work harder and be better at magic. The point system is kind of like demerits in muggle schools.

And the head of houses being teachers? I can see Dumbledore responding like thus "Why yes, as soon as we have enough funding to employ a living History teacher, I will get right on bringing in four glorified student counselors to the payroll."

And Divination? To be honest, divination is heavily implied to be valid (most of Trelawney's "hokey" predictions end up being true), but its taught by someone who reminds me of Bill Murray's soothsayer tv show in Ghostbusters 2. The course is supposed to be about interpreting signs and there meanings, not about laying out prophecies (which only seers can do). The trouble is, unlike the other subjects, the results of divination are open to interpretation and thus it appears fake.
