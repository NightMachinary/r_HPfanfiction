The subjects I listed are widely provided at highschools (age 9 - 12) in the United States.

I'd argue that people use everything that they /successfully learn/ at school. A good education doesn't just force children to memorize things, it shows them how to understand the world around them and apply reason to make intelligent decisions. Those skills are always "practical."

Literature is a very important subject because it gives children examples of how to effectively express themselves with words. It's also important as a taste of their own culture (English, German, Magical, etc.), of experiences beyond what they get in their normal life, of strong emotions and how to deal with them in a healthy way, etc. You mentioned preparation for job interviews: Literature/English classes usually cover persuasive writing, a basic skill which is key to writing job applications and presenting yourself well in an interview.

Mathematics is important to many, many different career fields aside from mathematicians. It's useful for daily life to balance a checkbook or understand investments. Even construction workers (such as electricians or carpenters) benefit from a good understanding of geometry and algebra.

In conclusion: knowledge for knowledge's sake is great, but all knowledge is power. A good education (including the subjects I listed) empowers children to be strong adults.
