  Hogwarts spectacularly fails to prepare it's students for anything
#+end_quote

A fairly normal school, then. Real life schools don't generally teach economics, philosophy, anatomy, or civics, at least not in the UK. 99% of what you learn at school, you never use again. Literature is of questionable practical use. And unless you go into a mathematical career, you don't really need to use much mathematics beyond arithmetic, basic statistics and percentages.

School is very much not a practical preparation for life. There are no classes on financial planning, how to pay a bill, how to unblock a toilet, how to perform well in an interview, etc. Education is academic, not practical, and largely imparts knowledge for knowledge's sake.
