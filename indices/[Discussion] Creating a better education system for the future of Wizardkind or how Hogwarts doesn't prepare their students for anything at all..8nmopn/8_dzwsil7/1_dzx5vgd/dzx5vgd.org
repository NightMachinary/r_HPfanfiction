  Why is Muggle Studies not important? Schools try to focus on information that is important to functioning within THEIR society, not others.

It's interesting that you raise this point, because Hogwarts spectacularly fails to prepare it's students for anything other than spellcasting. For its students to be prepared for adult life in magical Britain, the school should provide classes in mathematics, economics, civics, philosophy, anatomy, languages (including English), literature, etc.

In the muggle world, a "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_arts_education][liberal arts education]]" includes these subjects because they are considered essential for a free person to know in order to take an active part in civic life. These same subjects are needed for a wizard or witch to participate intelligently in magical society.
