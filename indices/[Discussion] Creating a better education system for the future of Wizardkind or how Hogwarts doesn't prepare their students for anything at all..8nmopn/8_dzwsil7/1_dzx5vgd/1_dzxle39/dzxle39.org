Right, but your missing something. Kids are taught elsewhere about the basics (or are supposed to be) prior to attending Hogwarts. Hogwarts is not a public school as would be thought by muggles. It reminds me of older style boarding schools, where only a handful of subjects are actually taught, most of which have no bearing on any future endeavors.

Hogwarts almost strikes me as a traditionalist organization. Much of how or why things are done has less to do with it being the best way, and more to do with "thats how its always been done." It would not surprise me if those courses have been the same ones taught for centuries.
