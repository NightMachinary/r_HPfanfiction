  Kids are taught elsewhere about the basics (or are supposed to be) prior to attending Hogwarts.

The curriculum at Hogwarts would make sense if that were the case, but we never hear about any lower-age schools in the wizarding world. The rich families seem to get their kids private tutors, but can poorer families (like the Weasleys) afford that? Not to mention, civics, economics and (magical) literature would be very useful for muggleborns who haven't had the opportunity to learn how wizarding society actually functions.

I agree that Hogwarts as presented in the books seems very traditionalist. I enjoy reading fics that explore aspects of magical education not covered in canon.
