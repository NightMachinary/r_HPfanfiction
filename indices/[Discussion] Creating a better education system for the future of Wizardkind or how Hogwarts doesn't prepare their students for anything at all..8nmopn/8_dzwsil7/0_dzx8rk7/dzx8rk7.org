  Why only Hogwarts? Well, there is only 11 schools according to Rowling,

Where? There are 11 dominant ones that are registered with the ICW, but smaller ones are known besides the eleven, such as the Salem Witch Institute mentioned in Goblet of Fire. Most just aren't registered so they're hard to keep track of. In smaller nations, apparently correspondence education is common.

  Schools try to focus on information that is important to functioning within THEIR society, not others

All wizards are required to keep magic as secret as possible, yet the average wizard can't seem to mask themselves as muggles in public. Hell, in book 1 apparently after Voldemort's defeat became apparent half of the British wizarding community lost their mind and had numerous instances that made Muggle news (conjured shooting stars, overabundance of owls in the skies, etc.) A good, required Muggle Studies education would go a long way towards blending in and understanding the world they're supposed to hide from.

  To be honest, divination is heavily implied to be valid

Nonsense, it's mostly shown to be silly. Trelawney has like 2 or 3 instances where those goofy things came true, but that's because they were worded vaguely enough that they could easily be interpreted to come true with the slightest resemblance. At best we have something like what the centaurs do (broad predictions about historically important shifts on the horizon) and Seer visions. If Dumbledore, Hermione and McGonagall are rather dismissive of it, it's probably bunk in the way she taught it.
