The Head of Houses seems a weird criticism to me. Not that we ever took school houses half as seriously as Hogwarts but our Head of Houses were teachers (with student captains doing most of what the role actually entailed-cheering on students at sport events basically).

Other than what others have said. I think it's worth noting that Hogwarts is a bit of collection of the worst tropes for teachers-we've all had the 'boring history teacher', the Snape teacher, the absolutetly useless teacher (Trelawney) and so on.
