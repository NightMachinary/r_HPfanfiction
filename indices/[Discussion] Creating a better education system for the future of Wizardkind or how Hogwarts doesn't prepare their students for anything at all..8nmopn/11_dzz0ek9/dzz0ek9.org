  Like how to use quills and parchment for one.
#+end_quote

A lot of fics say that there's a summer introductory thingy for muggleborns, and Harry didn't get into it due to a bureaucratic oversight.

  Another thing, why only Hogwarts? Do other schools not offer a place for students from other countries?
#+end_quote

Hogwarts is implied to be the best school in the UK, not the only one. What criteria does Hogwarts use in selecting which students get to attend? How bad are the other schools?

#+begin_quote
  On the topic of teachers, why are there so few teachers and why do they all have so many responsibilities?
#+end_quote

To reduce the number of characters in the story. A throwaway line about "Professor Withings, the other Potions professor" would have patched that hole (and probably introduced others).

If you look at it, the workloads for professors aren't /outrageous/... I mean, it's more than a 40 hour week for most of them, but different laws and all. The students, on the other hand, are in class about half as much as professors, which means they're unsupervised a lot of the time.

  All of these teachers have double duties that would be in conflict with one another as well as leave them open to favoritism. The head of a house could favor their own in class as Snape often does (staying undercover notwithstanding).
#+end_quote

And a Head of House that can discipline students of other houses can also exhibit favoritism. A professor who was a Hufflepuff but isn't Head of House could exhibit favoritism. You need firm oversight.

  Also, why is your caretaker a squib? Is it necessary to torture someone who cannot even cast a single spell by forcing them to be in the presence of eleven year-olds that have more ability than they ever will?
#+end_quote

It's a disability. Is it torture for a person who uses a wheelchair to see children running around? And Mr Filch doesn't seem to have a problem maintaining the castle.

#+begin_quote
  One that note: why is Astronomy a late night class?
#+end_quote

A monthly outdoor lab (scheduled on a Friday evening) with a normal classroom lecture would make sense.

#+begin_quote
  Hogwarts has a room where ANYTHING can be manifested and they fail to use it as a learning tool.
#+end_quote

They don't know about it. Tom Riddle learned a fragment of its significance, and Albus Dumbledore learned a fraction of that. Circa 1996 they learned more, but that's too late in the series to introduce educational changes.

I mean, do you have any idea how complicated it is to make good schedules? The current ones were probably made in the mid-eighties -- the 1780s, that is -- and they're not about to change them because that would be weeks of hair-pulling work. They give kids time machines to attend all their classes not because they have too few hours per day, but because that's easier for everyone involved.

  Divination seems to be only successfully used by seers and is a waste of a subject in my opinion.
#+end_quote

The professor is necessary for narrative purposes, and the class is thematically appropriate. I would have added a practical use for it, though.

#+begin_quote
  Especially for a world that seems to produce dark lords on a regular basis.
#+end_quote

Europe produced two Dark Lords in a century. I'm not sure that's "a regular basis".
