  One that note: why is Astronomy a late night class?
#+end_quote

Money. In PoA, Harry sees a moving model of the entire Milky Way galaxy which is specifically noted could replace his Astronomy classes. But it was also noted to be expensive.

Incidentally, an accurate, moving, real time model of the entire galaxy is also something far beyond current Muggle cosmology or computer science. So much for Muggles being "more advanced".

I'm never quite sure what people mean when they say Muggles are "more advanced" than wizards.

Is it a reference to understanding of the universe? If so then surely it's a non-starter. In a universe where magic exists, any description of the universe which does not take magic into account is just fundamentally wrong. Muggle scientific theories may be useful (thanks to their lack of interaction with magic) but in terms of their truth value, they are simply not correct. The universe is a far wackier place than Muggles believe, and a far more anthropocentric one. It's not just that Muggles are factually incorrect - their entire world view, informed by the content of their scientific theories, is false.

Is it a reference to capabilities? Again, this seems odd. Wizards have instant transportation, can regrow limbs, can delve into the mind, can rearrange matter. If they had any use for one, they could easily create a perpetual motion engine - with first year spells. The only areas where Muggles have an advantage in capabilities are 1) information storage and retrieval, 2) large scale production, 3) making large explosions. But number 2 wouldn't transfer to the wizarding world, due to the fact that casting magic cannot be automated, so that one is less that Muggles are more advanced and more that they are operating in a different paradigm. A Muggle with knowledge of logistics and manufacturing methods would not be able to improve wizarding production. As for number 3, it's not clear that creating very large non-magical explosions is useful for wizards.

Is it a reference to civics? If so, then it misses the point that wizarding problems are a mirror of Muggle ones. The wizarding world doesn't have gender or racial discrimination, but it does have species and blood discrimination. The wizarding government detains suspected terrorists indefinitely without trial in inhumane conditions, as the Muggle government does. Wizarding politicians are self-serving and advance policies designed to pander to their supporters rather than to improve the nation, as Muggle politicians do. Mainstream wizarding press is misleading, gossipy, and overtly politically biased, as the mainstream Muggle press is. And so on.

Ultimately, I feel like most people are referring to aesthetics. Wizards wear robes. They occupy buildings that are constructed out of traditional materials and in old architectural styles. They have traditional forms of entertainment such as sports and tabletop games, rather than consumption of entertainment media and video games. But these are the most trivial bases to compare a civilisation on.
