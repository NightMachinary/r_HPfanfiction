You say the leagal aspects are mostpy handled, but thats only on most countries. There is still legal supression of minoritys in the world. Or even overtly mysoginistic laws, like in India, where marital rape is legal. I don't agree that the difference in scope is actually that big. Second class citizenship is unthinkable? Don't think so: in Saudi Arabia women aren't allowed to drive. If thats not second class citizenship then idk what is.

The current president of the USA was talking about "Mexico sending rapists" just last April. Thats as scary as a "Lord Malfoy" spewing bigoted bullshit. So no, i wouldnt say the legal side is "mostly" handled, when the most powerfull man in the world can spew openly bigoted bullshit and remain in office.

I totally agree with your second point though.

Sry for my english and formatting, im no native speaker and on the phone.
