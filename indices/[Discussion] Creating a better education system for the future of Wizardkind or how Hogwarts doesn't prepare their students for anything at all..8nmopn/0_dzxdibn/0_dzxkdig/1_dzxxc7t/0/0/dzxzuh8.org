I'd say the situation in certain arabic countries parallells the goblin situation. Yeah, on peacefull times we're past slavery, but Stalins soviet union or Nazi-Germany wasnt far off slavery. But yeah, the U.K. moved past those things for the most part. Don't know how they are about equal gender salaries, but thats not really comparable to the goblin issue anyway. But maybe other wizarding countries are further developed on creature right then britain like muggelbritain is further on other social issues then others. We don't know sadly.
