You're right overall, of course, but there are a few points I'd disagree with.

#+begin_quote
  Is it a reference to civics? If so, then it misses the point that wizarding problems are a mirror of Muggle ones.
#+end_quote

Not necessarily. The Wizarding problems are obviously a twisted reflection of the Muggle ones, but they /are/ arguably much more serious and backwards (as it is their very nature as satire to be, Doylistically speaking). Sure, Muggles detain prisoners in /bad/ conditions, but they don't /knowingly obliterate their immortal soul/. Yes, there's still some racism left in the world, but it's a cultural thing; the /legal/ aspects are mostly handled; House-Elf slavery or the Goblins' second-class citizenship are unthinkable in the modern world.

#+begin_quote
  In a universe where magic exists, any description of the universe which does not take magic into account is just fundamentally wrong.
#+end_quote

It's one way to look at it, but somehow it seems hard to reconcile with your /usual/ stance on magic vs. science. You see magic as something that /supersedes/ Muggle science and the natural order, rather than an undiscovered /side/ of physics as Muggles know them; if so, why should magic invalidate Muggle science? This would be akin to saying that the existence of artificial genetic manipulation somehow invalidates evolutionist biology. Muggles don't know that there's a cheat code to kick the laws of the universe in the backside, but they /do/ know the laws of the universe; wizards are the opposite; everyone's missing some key information there.

Oh, also, unrelated to those two quibbles I think there's another element that makes people assume wizards are "less advanced" than Muggles: space conquest. Take any "Muggles are better" fic, you have /very high/ odds of the pro-Muggle protagonist bluntly informing Draco Malfoy that Muggles have gone to the Moon and everyone will go "/Merlin's nostrils, WHAT!? what have we been doing with our lives? HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?!/"

Mark that I don't think that argument's right, necessarily. We don't hear about it, but it is my belief that some wizards /have/ gone to space and perfected the process, but it was never made a big deal out of because it's not, at the end of the day, very useful (except for collecting moonstones in use for potions).
