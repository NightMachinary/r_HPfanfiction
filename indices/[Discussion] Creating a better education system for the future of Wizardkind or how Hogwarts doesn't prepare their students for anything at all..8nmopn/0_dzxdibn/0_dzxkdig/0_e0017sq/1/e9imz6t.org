There might not be prejudiced LAWS in canon, but who's to say that there aren't prejudiced people in charge in the ministry who will employ other pure- and half-bloods instead of muggleborns? Sure every once in a while someone will just be too good to be kept down, but mostly? You bet that if this bias is widespread (I mean even the Weasleys don't speak of their squib family member (the accountant!) because they frankly are probably disgusted (or afraid that asociating with that guy will make them more likely to have squibs or something!) and Ron wasn't punished or reprimanded for confunding his driving instructor! Damned, it's treated like if he had kicked a stray dog instead of having messed with another human's mind! Seriously, muggle-baiting/hunting is probably only illegal because of the Statute of Secrecy! Otherwise it seems you are allowed to screw with muggles, as long as you don't expose the wizarding world!)
