  Not necessarily. The Wizarding problems are obviously a twisted reflection of the Muggle ones, but they are arguably much more serious and backwards (as it is their very nature as satire to be, Doylistically speaking). Sure, Muggles detain prisoners in bad conditions, but they don't knowingly obliterate their immortal soul. Yes, there's still some racism left in the world, but it's a cultural thing; the legal aspects are mostly handled; House-Elf slavery or the Goblins' second-class citizenship are unthinkable in the modern world.

There's a few matters wrapped up in here:

1. I think describing what went on in Guantanamo Bay etc as "bad conditions" is something of an understatement. Being physically and mentally tortured for years on end is I think just as bad as Dementor exposure.

2. The wizarding analogue of Muggle racism is blood prejudice. On that front, wizarding Britain had a Muggleborn Minister for Magic in the 1960s. The idea of there being legal blood discrimination (except, of course, in Voldemort's Ministry*) is a fandom creation. In canon, blood discrimination is also purely cultural, and like racism in real life, not something that comes up in polite conversation. Note, for example, that Lucius restrains himself from making comments about Muggleborns in front of Fudge in GoF. Not because Fudge does not share the same prejudices -- we know Fudge is naturally inclined to favour pure-bloods -- but because it is politically incorrect.

3. The creature situations have no real Muggle analogy and I included them largely for compleness' sake. (The Muggle analogy would be if we discovered intelligent alien life that was weaker than us). There are real discussions to be had on those matters - Goblins are far from innocent in the conflict between them and wizards, for example, and granting your most powerful advantage (knowledge of wand magic) to a persistent enemy would be incredibly foolish.

*Voldemort's Ministry is something of an aberration, in that it was built entirely upon the personal power of a single man. Each time Voldemort dies, his movement immediately collapses and wizarding Britain reverts to its norm of being roughly equivalent to Muggle society. I don't think it really says anything about wizarding society as a whole - give a white supremacist all the power of the US military and you'd get a similar result. It's a risk inherent to the existence of magic, which can concentrate an absurd amount of power in individuals, that a single person can shift the direction of an entire nation against its will.

  It's one way to look at it, but somehow it seems hard to reconcile with your usual stance on magic vs. science. You see magic as something that supersedes Muggle science and the natural order, rather than an undiscovered side of physics as Muggles know them; if so, why should magic invalidate Muggle science? This would be akin to saying that the existence of artificial genetic manipulation somehow invalidates evolutionist biology.

Magic is not an invention or technology though. It is part of the supernatural order, rather than the natural one, but it is something which exists independently of wizards. It's still part of the universe, it's just that the universe has two parallel sets of rules.

However, the fact that one of those sets overrules the other indicates that they aren't really parallel but rather that one is senior and the other is junior. So, for example, if wizards have a description of matter and Muggles have a contradictory description of matter, it is the wizarding one which tells the real story because, when the two come into conflict, the world will behave according to the wizarding understanding.
