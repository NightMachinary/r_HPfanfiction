Why would you think HP goblins are inherently evil? They seem to mirror wizarding society to me -- most of them put their heads down and follow Voldemort's rule, while a few of them refuse to do so and go in hiding with the muggleborns. If anything DH seems to challenge the concept, by bringing up cultural differences and Harry wondering whether the sword was rightfully Gryffindor's. Also, Hermione says (in reference to Goblins) /Wizarding history often skates over what the wizards have done to other magical races/, establishing wizarding PoV as biased. Griphook dislikes Death Eaters in particular (screws them over with the fake sword), is brave enough to lie to Bellatrix's face, disapproves of house elf oppression and despises the idea of stealing what is not is. He is hardly good -- he dislikes most wizards for the oppression of his species -- but then, his views are mentioned to be extremist among goblins.

None of this makes goblins treacherous by nature, or make them close to innately evil. People are just mad Griphook made off with the sword before Harry could stab him in the back.

  even the "enlightened" characters like Hagrid are immensely wary of them.

Hagrid is also immensely "wary" of Slytherins and foreigners. Hermione (in DH, not GoF) is sympathetic to goblins. I think by DH she's more reliable than Hagrid in these matter.s
