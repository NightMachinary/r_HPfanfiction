  Goblins' situation seems akin to the status of Jewish people in Europe for large stretches of history (disliked by most, second-class citizens at best, but still trusted with banking; stereotyped as greedy and dishonest; have a language that is proverbially unintelligible to those who haven't learned it)

This is what I mean when I say comparisons aren't really good to make with these creatures: for all that we can see, there's a very good chance that the untrue stereotypes about Jews are actually true about goblins. They may in fact enjoy eating children, and they may be treacherous and greedy by nature. Certainly they act like it in the books.

Indeed, while the comparison with Jews is too neat to be accidental, I'm not sure that JKR was intending, with goblins, to have them be a sympathetic victim as Muggleborns are. Rather, I think she was doing something different with goblins: she's not positioning them as a wizarding analogy for a Muggle prejudices, but rather is doing worldbuilding such that the true stories about goblins were the historical origin of the incorrect stereotypes about Jews.

The point here is that, unlike all the targets of biotry in real life, /goblins are not human/. It's entirely possible that there are good reasons to be prejudiced against them. There must be a reason that JKR did not choose to introduce a single sympathetic goblin and that even the "enlightened" characters like Hagrid are immensely wary of them.

(Sometimes I amuse myself with the idea that Harry Potter goblins are the distant descendents of Lord of the Rings goblins - they certainly seem to share a certain innate evilness.)
