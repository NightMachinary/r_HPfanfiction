Hm. I am immensely creeped out by the idea of an inherently evil sentient species, and I doubt that Christian J.K. Rowling would truly populate her world with such creatures. But whatever may be said of Goblins, she still presents House-Elves' abuse as unambiguously a bad thing, and the prejudice against Centaurs likewise; those are still things where the Wizarding World remains inferior to the Muggle world in the ethics department.

As to your pet-theory, didn't Tolkien say that he loathed to think of any sentient beings as inherently evil (much as myself)? That he once considered to have them be more like golems than real people to resolve that problem --- something that cannot be true of HP Goblins, either? And much has been made of the mention that "members of all races except Elves fought against Sauron in the final battle", which would imply some rebellious Orcs. Really, laugh all you like, my preferred view of Tolkien's Goblins, and one not far from his intention, is that presented in the Rankin-Bass film, with the /Where There's a Whip/ song. Beings of primitive culture who are born to serve the Dark Lord(s), but who don't necessarily /want/ to go out of their way to do evil individually, though some do and become the leaders.
