I was definitely referring to sentient nonhumans; I am quite aware that there is no legalized blood prejudice. But though Goblins may not be entirely blameless, the fact remains that nonhuman rights /is/ an issue where the Wizarding World is /unspeakably/ behind the Muggle one on the matter of civic rights.

I would say you are wrong to say they have absolutely no parallels, too; it seems clear there are /some/ kinds of comparisons to be drawn for Goblins, Centaurs and House-Elves, though not really for the more obscure ones (Erklings, Banshees, Yumboes...) and none as direct as with the blood-prejudice. Goblins' situation seems akin to the status of Jewish people in Europe for large stretches of history (disliked by most, second-class citizens at best, but still trusted with banking; stereotyped as greedy and dishonest; have a language that is proverbially unintelligible to those who haven't learned it), House-Elves have been compared with black people slavery but I'd also compare it to the apalling way European upper-classes would look down on servants up to the 20th century, and there are shades of Native Americans and other colonized so-called "savages" in the Centaurs.

But as you can see, all the parallels with the sentient nonhumans are /historical/ ones; antisemitism, classism and colonialism are not /dead/, but they are no longer the majority, nor /officially enforced/, as they are in the WW.

  However, the fact that one of those sets overrules the other indicates that they aren't really parallel but rather that one is senior and the other is junior. So, for example, if wizards have a description of matter and Muggles have a contradictory description of matter, it is the wizarding one which tells the real story because, when the two come into conflict, the world will behave according to the wizarding understanding.

Hm... I don't think I quite agree with that. As I said, magic seems to me like "cheat codes" that override a video game's primary mechanics; in most cases, when the two clash, magic will supersede the natural order --- but magic is the active action of living beings. Left on their own, things work according to physical laws; and /if/ a magical creature interferes the laws of magic take over.
