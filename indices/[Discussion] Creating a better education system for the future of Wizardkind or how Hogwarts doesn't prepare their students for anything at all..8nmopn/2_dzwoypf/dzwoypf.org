Alright so I'll take a shot at debunking most of this (though you do make a few fair points I will highlight).

#+begin_quote
  From what I understand there are no places of learning after Hogwarts.
#+end_quote

Yes and no. There is a sort of apprenticeship-system. Once you enroll in your chosen career, if it's not a personal one like Diagon Alley shopkeeper, you'll have additional specific training (we see this for Ministry work, Healing, and Aurors).

#+begin_quote
  Like how to use quills and parchment for one. I can barely use an ink pen without covering myself and the paper in black. I wouldn't know where to start with a quill. You also need to learn how to sharpen a quill and the basic upkeep of it.
#+end_quote

You're thinking awfully Muggle. It seems obvious to me those quills are /enchanted/, not something plucked right off some random pheasant in the wilderness. So they wouldn't /need/ sharpening, and may even enable easy writing to an extent.

#+begin_quote
  How to polish them, keeping their bristles straight
#+end_quote

Again, you don't need to do that on a magical broom. There are Charms to keep it in pristine condition. If the Charms start to fail, then the broom is just too old for use, and that's that.

#+begin_quote
  and how to keep them from killing you by failing midair.
#+end_quote

What do you suppose Flying Class is? From what we see of the first lesson, it /was/ a very sensible thing starting with the basics.

#+begin_quote
  Hogwarts is a private institution of learning. You have to pay for it
#+end_quote

...no you don't? You have to buy your robes and equipment, sure, but there's no Hogwarts tuition fee. It's explicitly a free school. How do you suppose Tom Riddle got in? Or even the Weasleys?

#+begin_quote
  Why aren't students given the option to attend Beuabaxton or Drumstrung?
#+end_quote

They totally are. It's a Hogwarts /Acceptance/ Letter, not a Hogwarts You-Have-To-Come-Here-By-Law Letter. As the only British school, it stands to reason a British kid would go there, but if you speak French or Japanese and want to enroll in one of the foreign schools, it's perfectly allowed.

#+begin_quote
  Also, why do teachers visit students? Shouldn't it be the job of the government of the community that they will become a part of?
#+end_quote

Hogwarts Professors deal with young children all the time; it's their job. They are, therefore, more qualified from the get-go than some clerk. And the Ministry of Magic is inescapably incompetent and corrupt besides (which is another matter entirely).

#+begin_quote
  Minerva McGonagall is the Deputy Headmistress, the Head of Gryffindor House and the Transfiguration Professor. Severus Snape is both the Potions Professor and the Head of Slytherin House. Pomona Sprout is responsible for being both being the Herbology Professor and the Head of Hufflepuff House. Filius Flitwick is both the Charms Professor and the Head of Ravenclaw House.
#+end_quote

You act like being Head of House is horribly time-taking. It's... not. It basically involves being the person the students go to if they're in trouble. It's not a full-time job at all.

#+begin_quote
  Also, why is your caretaker a squib? Is it necessary to torture someone who cannot even cast a single spell by forcing them to be in the presence of eleven year-olds that have more ability than they ever will?
#+end_quote

No one's forcing Filch to anything. As I understand it, Argus Filch grew up /worshipping/ Hogwarts, and, heartbroken when he discovered he was a Squib, decided to become the caretaker as the "next best thing", his only option to live at Hogwarts anyway. He's not a slave, you know, he could quit at any time.

#+begin_quote
  Then again, I don't think Snape should eve be allowed to teach.
#+end_quote

Well, /obviously/. Like Trelawney, it's kinda his whole point that Dumbledore is keeping him at Hogwarts under the /pretense/ of being a teacher so he can keep him protected and in check. He does not /rightfully/ belong there, and, hadn't he died, I'm fully convinced Dumbledore would have gladly let him go (and he would have gladly left) once Voldemort was dead and gone.

#+begin_quote
  and has become more advanced.
#+end_quote

In what way? Yes, wizards are kinda clueless about science for the most part, and that's deplorable, but they don't /need/ it. Objectively speaking, they have all the commodities of Muggle civilization, and /then/ some. Their medicine is impossibly more advanced, you only need an old boot and coordinates to travel anywhere in the world, etc.

#+begin_quote
  on that note: why is Astronomy a late night class? Hogwarts has a room where ANYTHING can be manifested and they fail to use it as a learning tool. Use is for Astronomy so students don't have to be out of bed late into the night.
#+end_quote

The Room of Requirement isn't the Holodeck. It can turn into any /room/ you need it to be, but expecting it to create a flawless copy of the Solar System is an aberration that you'll only find in fanfiction. And besides, it was a /secret/ room which none of the teachers knew about until 1998, and now it's the permanent residence of an angry firegod, so... best not to open it ever again, y'know?

#+begin_quote
  Binns only teaches one thing, over and over.
#+end_quote

Well, that's exaggeration, to be fair. He talks about Goblin Rebellions (and mark that it's a plural; it's not always the same one) a lot, but not /only/ that.

#+begin_quote
  Why had no one bothered to tell the man he's dead?
#+end_quote

Er, he quite knows he's dead, I don't know what fanfiction you've been reading. He's just too close-minded to think this is any reason to shirk on his professoral duties.
