You actually brought up some really points that I've managed to get wrong. Allow me to counterpoint some of your counterpoints.

  And the Ministry of Magic is inescapably incompetent and corrupt besides (which is another matter entirely).
#+end_quote

That's actually true. I wouldn't trust the MoM to correctly introduce anyone to the wizarding world seeing how bigoted they are. They would probably lead to no non-magical child ever attending a school.

#+begin_quote
  but if you speak French or Japanese and want to enroll in one of the foreign schools, it's perfectly allowed.
#+end_quote

But if you're a non-magical student then a Hogwarts teacher will be introducing you to the wizarding world. They would have full control of what schools you are exposed to and if you would know that there are other options at all.

#+begin_quote
  The Room of Requirement isn't the Holodeck.
#+end_quote

But it is a room full of chamber-pots. I'm not saying that you can perfectly recreate the solar system in alarming detail but you should be able to pull up a star chart or have the room replicate the night sky is some manner? It can produce complex objects like Dark Detectors as well as provide books on numerous subjects for the DA. I think we're selling the room a little short.

#+begin_quote
  In what way?
#+end_quote

Granted I am looking at the wizarding world through the lenses of someone in 2018. Hell even 1990 seems backwards as heck to me now.

#+begin_quote
  Er, he quite knows he's dead,
#+end_quote

What a boring existence. Wake up one day to find out that you're dead and can now just mess around with the living but no, instead you go right back to work. Yeish.
