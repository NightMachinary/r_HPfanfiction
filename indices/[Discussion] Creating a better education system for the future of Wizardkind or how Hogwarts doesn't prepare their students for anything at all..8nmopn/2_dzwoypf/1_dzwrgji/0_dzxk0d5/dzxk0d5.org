  But if you're a non-magical student then a Hogwarts teacher will be introducing you to the wizarding world. They would have full control of what schools you are exposed to and if you would know that there are other options at all.

The teacher usually handling such matters is Professor McGonagall. Does she strike you as a manipulative type who would intentionally mislead the students? Really? I can't give you any exact quotes, but Hagrid, too, refers to Hogwarts as "the best magic school'n the world" or something of the sort when describing it to Harry. This, by default, implies there are others. If the child (or his parents) enquire about these, I find it hard to believe Hagrid, or Dumbledore, or McGonagall, would withhold information about them.

  What a boring existence. Wake up one day to find out that you're dead and can now just mess around with the living but no, instead you go right back to work. Yeish.

Yeah, that's the joke.
