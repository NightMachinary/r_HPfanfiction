  You're thinking awfully Muggle. It seems obvious to me those quills are enchanted, not something plucked right off some random pheasant in the wilderness. So they wouldn't need sharpening, and may even enable easy writing to an extent.

  Again, you don't need to do that on a magical broom. There are Charms to keep it in pristine condition. If the Charms start to fail, then the broom is just too old for use, and that's that.

The existence of the [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Broomstick_Servicing_Kit][Broomstick Servicing Kit]] suggests otherwise. There's also the [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Self-Inking_Quill][Self-Inking Quill]], which suggests that self-inking quills are /not/ standard. In both cases, they reveal that they're not magical facsimiles, but real objects that /can/ have enchantments while still requiring manual maintenance of some kind. There are charms to help maintain objects, but they're not self-repairing or anything of the sort.
