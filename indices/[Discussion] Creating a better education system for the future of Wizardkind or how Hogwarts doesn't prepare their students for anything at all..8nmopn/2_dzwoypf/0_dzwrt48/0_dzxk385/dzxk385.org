That they're not all self-inking doesn't necessarily mean they're not all weakly enchanted to begin with; in the same way not every pencil is a cluth-pencil, but that doesn't mean students who don't have clutch-pencils use unrefined lumps of charcoal. My reasoning is that /de facto/, we /do not/ see any Muggle-raised students struggling with their quills in /Philosopher's Stone/; and that combined with the fact that the quills are bought in Diagon Alley, this /does/ make it exceedingly likely they are somewhat magical.

Granted on the Broomstick Servicing, though; but again, how /do/ we know broom upkeep isn't covered in Flying Class early on? We don't exactly have the full curriculum.
