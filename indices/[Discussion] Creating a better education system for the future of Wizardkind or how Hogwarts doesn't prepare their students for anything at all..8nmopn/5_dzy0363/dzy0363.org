You can -sort of- justify the canon magical world that way:

Perhaps magicals doesn't want to learn more? Perhaps they are content the way things are? Why would magicals need to learn more? Even without an income, they can actually live quite comfortably with just their wands alone. Yes Weasley family was poor but they were not suffering. They just couldn't buy some fancy stuff.

Magicals can do those:

- Duplicate food with a simple spell, hunt/farm with the aid of magic much more easily compared to muggles
- Teleport instantly away from dangerous predators
- Transfigure/Conjure clothing
- Transfigure/Conjure shelter

So the rest is just cosmetic, psychological needs. We see a lot of fighting and stuff from Harry's perspective but general public didn't need to know so much obscure magical stuff to live. And Hogwarts is a school to prepare children for the real world. If a student wanted to learn more, perhaps teachers could give them extra materials to study. But Harry wasn't really interested in that so we don't see much of it. I don't remember the name of the fic but there was one where someone said that the reason they learned leg locking curse etc. was for children to protect themselves against muggles if they somehow found themselves against them during Witch Hunting period.

Magical world is small, magicals also live longer than muggles and as a result the magical world is traditionalist and stagnant. Albus Dumbledore was born in 1881 and died 116 years old. Not because of natural causes either. And try to imagine living conditions of muggles at that time. Medical advancements, technological advancements etc. everything that makes the current muggle world "comfortable" today is quite recent. And since magicals don't really interact with muggles, it should not be that surprising that magical world is still living in the past. The past where they were living in much better conditions than muggles. While muggles were thinking about what to do with their feces without modern plumbing systems, magicals could just remove it.

So many of those flaws you can see, they might not necessarily see them as flaws. In the end, it has been working for centuries. We know that there were two dark lords in 20th century but were there lots of dark lords before?

  Muggles don't know that there's a cheat code to kick the laws of the universe in the backside, but they do know the laws of the universe; wizards are the opposite; everyone's missing some key information there.

We don't /know/ the laws of the universe. We see things happening and try to create formulas based on those happenings. If we can't disprove them over the course of long time, we call them /Laws/. Everybody thought Newton's formulas about gravity and speed and time was absolutely correct until Einstein proved him wrong. We still use Newton's formulas because they are 99.99% accurate in slow speeds but it doesn't change the fact that the are just producing approximations. Maybe Einstein's formulas are just approximations too but we don't have tools to measure that error. So even in our world, we don't know Laws of the universe.
