  Hogwarts is a private institution of learning. You have to pay for it.
#+end_quote

[[https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/622118373061709824][Hogwarts has no tuition fee according to JKR]].

#+begin_quote
  Also, why do teachers visit students? Shouldn't it be the job of the government of the community that they will become a part of?
#+end_quote

Maybe this is part of the job for Hogwarts as they get money for it by the MoM. Governments outsource stuff to private, better equipped entities all the time.

#+begin_quote
  On the topic of teachers, why are there so few teachers and why do they all have so many responsibilities?
#+end_quote

Because JKR wanted to keep the cast as small as possible.

#+begin_quote
  Also, why is your caretaker a squib? Is it necessary to torture someone who cannot even cast a single spell by forcing them to be in the presence of eleven year-olds that have more ability than they ever will?
#+end_quote

Presumably, because they applied for a job and got it, because they didn't want /not/ to be a part of that community. What a person wants (to stay part of the community) might not be what a person needs (to make your own, happy life), but who is the judge here? If the alternative would be sending them to the streets, would that be right? And afaik nobody is forcing them to stay, they could just quit.

  Muggle Studies should be a cumpulsary subjects for all students for magicOne that note: why is Astronomy a late night class? al families as Magical Studies should be for all students from non-magical families.
#+end_quote

Why if they never have to interact with the muggle world? It's like saying everyone needs to study the basics of computer science - sure, you might have a point, and it would be great, but it's not really needed.

#+begin_quote
  The muggle world outnumbers the wizarding world and has become more advanced.
#+end_quote

And yet they are often so far behind the wizarding world, especially in 1990. Mobile phones were just coming, and we've seen proof of school children in the late 1970s communicating with video-calls.

#+begin_quote
  Hogwarts has a room where ANYTHING can be manifested and they fail to use it as a learning tool.
#+end_quote

Presumably, because not even the headmaster knows all the secrets of the 1000 year old *magic* castle. Also, my school had a computer-lab, which we really didn't use all that often.

#+begin_quote
  Also, what is the point of Astronomy?
#+end_quote

What's the point of Latin in the curriculum? I was forced to learn that or French and never even used it!

#+begin_quote
  One that note: why is Astronomy a late night class?
#+end_quote

Magic, btw. You can't use your enchanted telescope in this weird enchanted room, because even with magic one could not hope to capture the vastness of space.

#+begin_quote
  But instead of actually teaching something valuable, it is taught by one of the most boring persons on campus
#+end_quote

Have you ever been in a history-class? With a bad teacher, they can be super boring, and they are also important in the muggle world which seems to create Dictators on a semi-regular basis. Heck, the US has an aspiring dictator as president right now!

#+begin_quote
  Binns only teaches one thing, over and over.
#+end_quote

The history-exames are actually quite more extensive than goblin stuff, but let's not get canon in the way about your rant, right? Quote from PoS: "One hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who'd invented Self-Stirring Cauldrons and they'd be free..."

#+begin_quote
  Even McGonagall bends a few rules for Harry during his time at Hogwartsm such as allowing him to be a first year Quidditch player.
#+end_quote

Yeah, because sticking to every rule ever is a great thing, especially with no-tolerance policies and stuff. Rules often are guidelines that are /meant/ to be bent.

I mean some of your arguments are great, but they aren't as tight as you think them to be, which gives your whole post this weird feeling of not being quite correct, and thus being dismissable.
