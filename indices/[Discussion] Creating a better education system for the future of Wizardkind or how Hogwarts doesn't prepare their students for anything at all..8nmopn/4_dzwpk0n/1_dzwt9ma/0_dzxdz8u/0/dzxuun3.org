I think you are underestimating the risks and the observance of muggles. I don't recall it being made explicit that Muggles simply choose to ignore the Knight Bus. Unless I'm misremebering, that was Shunpike's explanation but we know Muggles have to be Obliviated when they see undeniable magic, which leads me to assume they cannot see the what the Knight Bus does around them (much in the way they can't see the Leaky Cauldron). His comment seemed more like an example of the dismissive view many wizards have about muggles. Getting rid of that and following the SoS carefully seems like a perfectly reasonable reason to make a decent, mandatory Muggle Studies course.

The Roberts in GoF had to be repeatedly Obliviated (even before the Death Eaters showed up) simply due to their growing suspicions about the odd things they were seeing and hearing (the one we see actually happen was done rather preemptively). It's probably more thwan most muggles aren't sufficiently exposed to magical phenomena to give it real thought. Spotting unknown animal droppings (as Newt mentions) isn't a dead ringer for "This is magic!"
