I think you overestimate the risks of a breach of the statute. In the HP universe, Muggles have a kind of in-built psychological instinct to reject the existence of magic even when it occurs right in front of their eyes. This phenomenon is referred to in many places: the existence of the book "The Philosophy of the Mundane: Why the Muggles Prefer Not to Know", the Pottermore article on wizarding radio and TV, and an entry in Fantastic Beasts about Muggles ignoring magical creatures.

The most extreme example, of course, is the Knight Bus, which we are told Muggles ignore simply because they are insufficiently observant to notice reality being rearranged around them (including entire buildings, occupied by Muggles, jumping around before their eyes).

For all that wizards in the HP universe are depicted as being silly, Muggles are depicted as being equally silly, just in the opposite direction.
