  Why if they never have to interact with the muggle world? It's like saying everyone needs to study the basics of computer science - sure, you might have a point, and it would be great, but it's not really needed.

Ehh, not a great comparison. Wizards bandying about in public and in robes or celebrating major events by conjuring shooting stars in the sky (which end up on the muggle news, as in book 1)... it creates a problem for maintaining the Statute of Secrecy. There's an inherent value in wizards having a (good) required Muggle Studies education.
