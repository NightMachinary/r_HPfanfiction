Filch and Binns exist to promote bigotry, same as why Malfoy is allowed to be a jerk to muggleborns without facing disciplinary actions.

Filch teaches mischievous students how learning magic allows them to outwit those without magic.

Binns teaches prejudice against muggles and goblins while also failing to deliver a civics studies class, thus educating students into supporting the dystopic government ruling over Magical Britain.

Binns class, the poor quality of the muggles studies class, the secrecy, the fact that electronics don't work and making it a boarding school all help to break muggleborn students from their original culture and encourages them to become obedient second class citizens in the Magical World.

If Hogwarts taught mundane subjects like basic anthropology/civics, maths, arts and basic science, then muggleborn students wouldn't face an insanely hard time if they decide they want to either return to the muggle world or at least be able to live in both worlds. And should they teach them civics, they may get ideas about separation of powers, elective parliament, due process and all that.
