There is a fem!Harry story where Harry gets turned into a girl by Draco or something and ends up with a Harem and while hes not "submissive" if memory serves me its a little more weighted on the girls side over Harry's. Sadly I honestly cant remember its name, as I read it years ago. Hopefully someone else knows the one I am talking about.

Also, I second the OP's requests. This request intrigues me.
