Thought it was going to go to some sort of chess gambling but this underground dueling seems more dramatic and could provide much more plot. Though I'd imagine this would set up some sort of conflict with Harry or other aurors due to the legality of the whole thing.

Very interesting canon divergence! Between Arthur dying, the Wealeys' Wizarding Wheezes not becoming a money spinner, and the seemingly disastrous end to his relationship with Hermione, this seems like it'd be a lot to overcome and could push Ron to desperate measures.

I noticed Ron seems to still have high respects for Harry so I'm assuming he'd be a protagonist? Anyways, great drabble! I'd be interested in reading more and there is an audience for everything. Good luck if you choose to expand on this.
