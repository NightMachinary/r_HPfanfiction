This is excellent. After reading so many fics centered strictly around Harry/Hermione's POV it's nice to see something that focuses on Ron. Especially in a universe that isn't so rosy for him.

Your dialogue and narration are expertly done. The characterizations are somewhat new, but Daphne is an unknown quantity so you're certainly free to do with her as you wish (and I really admire your effort so far), Ron is different but it's easy to see how his mental processes might turn in this direction after the background you've laid out. You deserve a lot of praise for this as you've laid out an AU without resorting to any sort of infodump or cagey author's note.

I'm extremely interested to know more about Hermione's character and what could have turned Ron off of her. The H/Hr fan in me hopes that she's with Harry and that the Prophet is wrong (again).

In any case, this is quite good and I hope you'll continue to share more of it with us.
