After a few more minutes of self-pity, he stood up and started his trek to the Weasley shop. Business had not been kind to the Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes. While their jokes and pranks sold like gold during the war, people were not as eager to buy a novelty prank now that they were in peacetime. George made enough money to keep the shop afloat, but he could not help their mother either.

A movement caught his eye.

Sparkling blond hair drew his gaze. Ron recognized her. Daphne Greengrass. He watched as she entered Knockturn Alley. The Ministry had gone through extensive lengths to purge the most darkest of wizards from Knockturn, but it still retained it's seedy reputation.

On a whim, Ron followed her.

His strides were longer and the crowd parted due to his size. He did not catch up to Daphne though, and she entered a building. A sign hung over the door. The Emporium.

Making a hasty decision, Ron followed her inside.

The air was rife with tobacco and burnt leaves. A single lantern radiated light from the middle, but it cast weird shadows everywhere he looked. Round tables littered the floor with no apparent shape. He spotted Daphne's long, blonde hair and quickly followed.

To his surprise, she entered another door near the back of the room instead of taking a seat. Curious, he followed the former Slytherin deeper and deeper into the building. He had half a mind to call out to her, but he did not want to attract too much attention to himself. Despite his current position, he was still one of the Golden Trio and this was still Knockturn Alley.

A much smaller room was hidden behind the door as Ron followed Daphne. There were fewer tables and fewer patrons this time. Still, Daphne entered yet another door and Ron was beginning to question his purpose at the Emporium. He pushed on.

In the next room, he finally caught up to her.

"Hello, Daphne," he said.

She whirled around, alarm and suspicion in her eyes. "What the bloody hell are you doing here, Ron?" She grabbed him by his elbow and led him to the corner.

A smile broke Ron's face as she frog marched him into the corner. "Whoa. I don't remember you being the aggressive one."

She scowled at him, her pretty face contorting tightly. "This is not the place for you to be."

"And what place am I supposed to be at?"

"Not here," Daphne repeated.

Ron took stock of the room. A surprising amount of people milled about the area. A large spotlight illuminated the center of the room. It was about twice the size of a regular classroom. With the number of people in the room, the atmosphere was almost intimate.

"What is this place anyway?" Ron asked.

Daphne opened her mouth to respond, but a loud gong cut her off. The rest of the wizards and witches shuffled around until the center of the room was clear. A door that Ron had not seen opened, and two wizards entered.

They wore loose robes and an odd chain around their neck. Ron watched, transfixed, as they faced each other in the center of the room. Then, they bowed.

/A duel!/

An luminescent dome surrounded the duelists as they squared off. Spells and hexes flew through the air. They were no match to someone like Harry, but they were passable. Ron had been in enough duels to know the value of an opponent. He could not tear his eyes off the sport and did not notice a man in a bowler cap approaching them.

"What's it going to be, Greengrass? You going to play it safe and take Rolly again? Odds aren't good. One to three favorite for him. I can give you two to one if Benji can last more than two minutes," said the old man in the bowler hat.

"Benji's new. He's not going to last two minutes. Put me down for a regular bet on Rolly," Daphne replied. She dropped a shiny Galleon into his bowler hat.

The old man nodded and placed the hat on his head after Daphne dropped the coin into it.

"What are you doing?" Ron asked.

"What does it look like? I'm placing a bet," Daphne said.

He shook his head, his eyes never leaving the two wizards. "You should have bet on the other one. Benji or whatever. He's going to win."

Daphne rolled her green eyes. "Rolly is a regular here. Trust me, he's going to win."

Ron disagreed and shook his head again. "Call him back. The man with the hat. Call him back."

"Ron, you shouldn't -"

He interrupted her. "Just call him back."

The man in the bowler hat returned and Ron teared his gaze off the duel for just a few seconds.

"Put a Galleon down on Benji for the win. Can you give me odds if he wins in the next two minutes?" Ron negotiated.

The old man in the bowler hat stared at the wall, bobbing his head, and then he replied, "Two and a half to one for the outright win. I can parlay it into a victory in the next two minutes for a total of seven to one."

"I'll take it."

He stared at Daphne expectantly. She returned his look with a mutinous expression on her face, but she eventually procured another Galleon from her purse and dropped it into the hat.

"You're going to pay me back for that," Daphne whispered as the man in the bowler hat left.

"I'll pay you back and more."

A bright flash of light engulfed the room and the newcomer was the only one who remained standing. Ron pumped his fist into the air, jubilation in his chest.

"I didn't take Arithmancy, but even I know I can pay you back with seven Galleons." Ron winked at her.

Daphne did not look amused. Her eyes glanced furtively around her as the loser, Rolly, was levitated away. She stood closer to him and wrapped a gloved hand around his elbow.

"Let's go. Someone like you shouldn't be here."

Ron was not going to be pulled away so easily. "Wait just a minute. Aren't you even going to ask how I knew the other guy would win?"

"Later," Daphne hissed, pulling him towards the door. He was stronger, though, and held his ground.

"Hey. What's the rush? I need to get my winnings."

"You'll get your bloody winnings, but this isn't a place for you to be," she reiterated.

"No, I want -"

"I don't bloody care what you want." She was so close to him now, her lips pressing against his ear. "For the last time you stubborn prat, let's go somewhere else. I'll talk to you about this there."

Ron was tired of being pushed around. He had just won nearly a third of what the bank was going to loan and only a dragon could pull him away now. Still, Daphne was not one to be frightened from his previous experience with her.

"You're going to tell me about this place. I want to know more."

For once, genuine worry flashed across her face. "Ron, this is fun once, but you can't be here. There's people that will recognize you. Dark wizards. Death E-"

"No." Ron interrupted her purposefully, knowing what she was going to say. "I want to know more."

Daphne hesitated, her beautiful green eyes looking up at him. "Are you sure?"

He looked around the dark and seedy room. The rest of the wizards were leaving, but he could see the man in the bowler hat making the rounds and paying out the victors. Ron had a sense that this was not an entirely legal venture and Daphne's worry only confirmed that thought. Still, it was easy money.

/Mum needs this/, he thought.

Ron leaned down and whispered into her ear.

"Yes. Tell me more."
