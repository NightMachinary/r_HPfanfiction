Sometimes the way to go is to search bookmarks rather than works. Bookmarkers can add their own tags that authors may not bother with. So for instance if you like indy!Harry you'd get [[https://archiveofourown.org/bookmarks/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&bookmark_search%5Bbookmarkable_query%5D=&bookmark_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=Independent+Harry+Potter&bookmark_search%5Bbookmarkable_type%5D=&bookmark_search%5Bbookmarkable_date%5D=&bookmark_search%5Bbookmark_query%5D=&bookmark_search%5Bother_bookmark_tag_names%5D=&bookmark_search%5Bbookmarker%5D=&bookmark_search%5Bbookmark_notes%5D=&bookmark_search%5Brec%5D=0&bookmark_search%5Bwith_notes%5D=0&bookmark_search%5Bdate%5D=&bookmark_search%5Bsort_column%5D=&commit=Search+Bookmarks][this list]] - and some of the bookmarkers might add a good amount of commentary. Or find one really good fic, see who bookmarked it, and look at their other bookmarks.

You can also try browsing the Collections to see if there's one on a topic that works for you.
