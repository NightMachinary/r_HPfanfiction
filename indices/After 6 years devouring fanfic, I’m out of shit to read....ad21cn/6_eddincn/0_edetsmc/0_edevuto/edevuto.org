I see a lot of you OG Fanfiction.net guys say that exact same thing.

I'd just filter by kudos and then cut out the draco/Harry tag because it dominates (unless you're down for that ship, in that case it's a gold mine) and then you'll see the top rated stuff. It's what I'm slowly working through now

My personal fave series is The Secret Language of Plants, my fave of all time. The first in the series is The Meaning of Mistletoe

And I just recently read Hogwarts, to welcome you home and loved that.

For a truly interesting set of What If fics, check out the Boy with a Scar series. The author takes a simple question like "what if Ron was the BWL?" or "What If Dudley had magic?" And rewrites the whole canon according to that.

The Ron centred one is particularly amazing. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8158447]])

For some funny cross overs, check out: Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/586020]]) for the Avengers And linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5030443/chapters/11562568]]) for Bleach

I realise these aren't really tailored to what you set out but these are what spring to mind when thinking of good fics from Ao3 that I'm fairly certain aren't on ffn (though don't quote me on that, usually authors say when they cross post but not always).

Another tip for ao3, is find a niche tag and sort by kudos through that. You like super Harry? Use the super!harry tag. Grey Harry? Slytherin harry? Independent Harry? Time Travel? Obscure ships? That One Trope That Just Does It For You? There's a tag for that. It's why I love ao3, super easy to find my niche.
