Haha I'm glad! I suppose I've had the advantage of it being the platform I found first so I wasn't accustomed to anything yet. I've been thinking about making a post over in [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] to go more in-depth on it because it seems to crop up a lot. So no problem! - also a Slytherin girl, glad you can find more fic :P
