I don't think you've looked to indepth -- I've been reading fanfic for ~6 years as well, and still have a big list of stuff I want to read. My only real requirements when i was younger was the longer the better -- I've read a ton of million word + things // series, now i like that 4-600k word per book sweetspot. Not to say I won't read shorter stuff, but I hate reading 40-150k because by the time you're invested, its over.
