17 years here. Always moving on to a new fandom/ships. After a year or two you can go back to your fav's and see what new stuff has been written. Right now i am in a Marvel phase (never read marvel before!). It's exciting discovering a brand new world :) My primary fandom has always been harry potter though, and i never run out - just be open to try new things - if it is well written, it quite often doesnt matter about the ship etc.
