Pretty much exactly what [[/u/rek-lama][u/rek-lama]] said... firstly, there's zero smut depicted thus far in DPaSW, it's definitely a grey!Harry, and pretty solidly an independent!Harry and super!Harry (or, at least, Harry is pretty darn OP). There's revenge, Dumbledore is, as stated by other users, very manipulative, so I'm struggling to see how this is /not/ what OP wanted.
