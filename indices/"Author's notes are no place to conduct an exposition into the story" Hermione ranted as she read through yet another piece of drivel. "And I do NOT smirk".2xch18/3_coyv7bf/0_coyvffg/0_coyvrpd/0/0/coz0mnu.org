Malfoy looked at the shabby man and then sneered, "Just wait until my father hears about this," his bookend bodyguards snickering stupidly beside him in a stupid fashion. Then, they cracked their knuckles, broke wind, and grunted at one another eloquently, if stupidly.

Hermione glared at the platinum-haired ponce, preemptively (if alliteratively) anticipating a comment about her blood status.

"Mudblood," drawled Malfoy with characteristic Slytherin sneakiness. He really had been showing his Slytherin SideÂ® a lot of late, as nothing quite says 'cleverness' like bluntly spewing hateful epithets in front of witnesses.

"You take that back!" roared Ron, stepping forward heroically to defend Hermione's honor (though, because he's Ron and thus a bit dim, he definitely hadn't quite realized that the bossy, bushy-haired, buck-teethed Gryffindor was actually a young woman with developing womanly parts that though a bit hard to make out their precise dimensions through the loosely-fitting robes, were nevertheless attached to someone with whom he was becoming totally bestotted), brandishing a shabby, second-hand wand held together with Spello-Tape, his most important Wizarding tool having been crushed under the stress of one of his Mum's too-enthusiastic hugs.

He pointed the wand at Malfoy and uttered not an English-language spell, as all of the ones he had tried since the ill-fated attempt on the train to Hogwarts his first year had failed miserably and, as a master strategist, he was anything but stupid (except in matters relating to Hermione, of course), but rather, having spent years in a /School of Magic/ learning how spell incantations are always, always, /always/ bastardizations of words or phrases from dead languages, with the rather dodgy, "/Edo orthogastropoda!/"

(That is to say, he shouted something random and sounding vaguely Latinesque and just got really lucky.)

There was a brilliant flash of light and Malfoy bent over double, vomiting up the first of many slimy, shell-less gastropods--though not as slimy as a Slytherin because they're all snakes and everyone knows snakes are slimy. (Unless they say so around Hermione, who would tell them otherwise, having read it in a book somewhere.)

"Better out than in," Hagrid grunted sagely, his beetle-black eyes rimming with mirth as everyone jumped back, startled. Nobody had seen the half-Giant approach. He was sneaky that way.

"Did you know that slugs have the largest penis-to-body-length ratio in all of the animal kingdom," Hermione commented, espying yet another opportunity to show off her love of books and of learning random trivia nobody else would find remotely noteworthy. "In fact, it has been documented that some species of banana slugs have phalluses well over five times their body length."

"Ew," Harry said, blushing at the oblique mention of a sexual organ. Even of a mollusk. Harry was an asexual being as pure as the driven snow when not dosed to the gills on /Amortentia/.

Hermione and Ginny shared a glance, then surreptitiously eyed each boys' trousers just below the beltline.

Then, they sighed in unison, tragic, disappointed sighs. Because of tragic disappointment. And loose-fitting robes.
