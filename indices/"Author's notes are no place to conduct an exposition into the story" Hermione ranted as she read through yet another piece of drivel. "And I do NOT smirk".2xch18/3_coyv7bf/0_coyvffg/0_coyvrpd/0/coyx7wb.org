Professor Lupin looked on mildly.

It is impossible for me to understate how mildly he looked on, it is also impossible for me to overstate it. He exuded such an aura of mildness as to make lukewarm 2% milk seem like hot sauce, and unsalted saltine crackers seem like... well... super salty ones.

His shabby robes complemented his shabby shirt and shabby trousers. Of course they paled in comparison to his shabby trunk, which was the shabbiest shab that ever shabbed. They did clash with his new necktie, which was a gift.
