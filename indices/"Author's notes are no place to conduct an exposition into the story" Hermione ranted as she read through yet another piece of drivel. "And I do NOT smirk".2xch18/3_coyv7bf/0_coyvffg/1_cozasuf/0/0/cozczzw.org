Charmed and shows like it, yeah. I just picked Charmed because it was the first thing that popped to mind, and because most people on Reddit are pretty young, so they might remember Charmed still. That said, I grew up in the '80s and early '90s, and a bunch of teen "witch" or "magic" movies included the phrase.

I'm not saying Charmed exclusively used it or created the phrase, just that the show definitely helped popularize it.
