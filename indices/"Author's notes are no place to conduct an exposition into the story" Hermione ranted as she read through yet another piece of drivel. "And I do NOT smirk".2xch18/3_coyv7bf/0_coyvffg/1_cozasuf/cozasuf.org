That shit right there. If I see that line in a fic, I instantly close it, no matter what. I'm willing to give almost anything a fair shake (unless the spelling/grammar are truly terrible), but even /one/ "so mote it be", and I'm hitting that X button.

The phrase never even comes up in canon! Not once! It's just something that shows like Charmed made "popular" in the late '90s/early '00s.

The line just sounds like something a preteen would say if they took their "Wiccan/Witch" phase too seriously.
