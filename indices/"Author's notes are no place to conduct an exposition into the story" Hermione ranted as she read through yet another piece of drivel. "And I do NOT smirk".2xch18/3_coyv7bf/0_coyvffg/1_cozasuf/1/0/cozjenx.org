The word "ward" also doesn't sound like something a 11 year old saw on TV or read on a Wiccan forum online, and decided to appropriate into their fanfiction.

Also, while the word "ward" may not be specifically mentioned, the general idea is most definitely implied and outright stated, just using general language like "protection spells".
