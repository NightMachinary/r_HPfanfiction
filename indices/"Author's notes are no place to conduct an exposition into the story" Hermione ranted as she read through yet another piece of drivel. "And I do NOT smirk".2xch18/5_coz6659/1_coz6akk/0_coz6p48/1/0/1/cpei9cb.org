Don't. Don't /ever/ read a fic based off of how many reviews it gets, or how many favorites it has.

Arguably some of the very /best/ fics ever written don't have many reviews.

Honestly, if Snarry!Slash fics have more reviews than fics actually /worth/ something, like Circular Reasoning, or the Denarian trilogy, or the Hero trilogy, or the Wastelands of Time trilogy...

Fanfiction.net reviews and favorites are worth almost nothing.
