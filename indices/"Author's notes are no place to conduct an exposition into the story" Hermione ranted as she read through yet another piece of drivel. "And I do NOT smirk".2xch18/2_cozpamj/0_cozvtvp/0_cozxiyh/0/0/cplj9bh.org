Yeah, each of Robst's chapters alternate between obscene bashing with twisted, simplified caricatures of certain characters, training, stupid romantic fluff, and then super Harry/Hermione beat Voldemort with the power of love and puppies, despite being decades younger and less experienced than the strongest dark lord in recent British history.

Once you've read one of them, you've read all of his stories.
