"Careful there, mate. Remember what the mediwitch said - if you keep being all emotional like this, your recently unblocked, 1000 times normal capacity power core might go critical.", Hermione admonished her friend.

Hermione was nodding her agreement as Ron continued - "It's getting kind of annoying actually. What do you think about - just in the interest of saving time - we officially rename you to HarryX1000, or even Harry1K?"
