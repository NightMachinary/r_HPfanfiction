Another story about Harry-The-Pushover?

Why does he wait? The only reason is to collect evidence and prepare his case for the divorce and it won't take months. When he gets everything together, Ginny is out.

If you want to feed your hunger for Weak Harry read some Potato19 or [[/u/starfox5]] stories - their Harry is golden standard for a doormat.
