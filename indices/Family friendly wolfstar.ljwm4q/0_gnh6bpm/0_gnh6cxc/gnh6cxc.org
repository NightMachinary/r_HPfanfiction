  Summer, 1999. Harry comes home with news. Quite a lot of news. Harry takes a deep breath.“I'm quitting the Aurors,” he starts with, which is followed by a moment of stunned silence.“What?” Sirius says.“All right," Remus says. “Do you know what else you want to do? Did you think about it?”Harry blushes, the way James used to---a rosy glow lighting up his brown skin---and says, “I wanted to---that is, I thought I might be a teacher.”Remus, quite suddenly, seems to have something in his eye. "Oh."“What?” Sirius says.“And uh---there's more. I was thinking I might like to. That is. I want to become an Animagus.”
