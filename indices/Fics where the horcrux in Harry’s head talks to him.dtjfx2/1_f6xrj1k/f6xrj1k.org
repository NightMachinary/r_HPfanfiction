!linkffn(Warning Signs Read Desolation) sort of counts. The exact nature of what happens is a bit of a spoiler. Abandoned, but still very much worth a read.

All of the following fics will be some form of HP/TR

!linkffn(Devil Take the Hindmost) has Harry able to communicate with Tom from the moment the connection between their souls was made. He acts as her guide and is able to reincarnate himself much earlier with Harry's help. Abandoned, but at a low point in the story's action so it's not hindering to the story.

!linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus) has Eleanor Lily Potter, a living God, frequently communicate with the scarcrux, whom she names Wizard Lenin. It's a very strange fic, and while I like it, it's not to everyone's taste. WIP

!linkffn(Departure from the Diary) is a fic of my own writing. The diary Horcrux merges with the scarcrux in the chamber and is currently guiding him while trying to contact Voldemort and make a body of her own. WIP

!linkffn(Horcrux by BlackenedQuill) is a fic inspired by my above fic and has a similar premise. Was supposed to be a threeshot, but appears to be abandoned.

!linkffn(The Advantages of Being Sane) is a light and straightforward Harry/fem!Voldemort fic. Voldemort was returned to sanity after her discorporeation, and is trying to make amends.
