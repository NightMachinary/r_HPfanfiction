Alright --- this is one of my favorite Harry and Dumbledore fanfics ever. So well-written and poignant. The only catch is that it's slash --- Harry/Dumbledore slash lol. But the author does a really good job of justifying and illustrating Harry's inner conflict and angst, it's actually so worth it.
