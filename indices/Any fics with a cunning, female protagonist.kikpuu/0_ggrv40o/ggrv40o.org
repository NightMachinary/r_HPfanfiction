Linkffn(The Blood Of Your Veins: Calista Snape Volume II) All 7 years with last 3 years canon overlap from Slytherin female OC POV. Complete.

Linkffn(Monster by Phoenyx634) Cunning female OC set in TMR era.

Linkao3(Dying is a delicate moment) Cunning Hermione in 1940's influencing TMR.

Linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology) Another slytherin Hermione.

Linkffn(Certain Dark Things) Slytherin Fem!Harry in a dark AU.

Linkffn(Felix Fortuna) MC has precognition capable of achieving almost any goal. What would a 13 year old do with such power? Similar premise: linkffn(Path to victory-A Severus Snape Story)

Linkao3(Rose Petal Red) Likely the most cunning of them all. MC is an SI with a costly precognitive power. Takes over Slytherin.
