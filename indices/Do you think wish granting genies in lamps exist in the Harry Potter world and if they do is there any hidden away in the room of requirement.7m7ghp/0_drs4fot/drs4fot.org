We know Genies/Djinns exist in some capacity in the Potterverse, but what they're like, no one knows. I'd take them to be something like House-Elves, having powerful magic and who can be enslaved to wizards' will through weird clauses (in House-Elves' case, as long as they're not presented with clothes; in Genies' case, if they're put inside a bottle or a lamp). Either way, it's unlikely they have all-powerful magic of the sort seen in the various /Aladdin/ stories.
