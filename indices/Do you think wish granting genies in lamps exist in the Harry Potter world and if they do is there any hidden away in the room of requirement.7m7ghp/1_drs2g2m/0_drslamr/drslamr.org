Still considering Genies/Djinns in some of the myths were tricksters if not out right malicious.

It would probable best to try and cover your ass to the best of your abilty with the first wish so as not to get screwed over.

You wouldn't want to be the person that wishes for Immortality only for your body to keep ageing so you end up in immortal in a body with all sorts of age related health problems unable to die.
