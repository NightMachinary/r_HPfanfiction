Maybe not Djinn precisely, but there might be [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ifrit][Ifrit]]... which is apparently djinn, but powerful and malevolent. Well.

As for one hidden away in the RoR... not likely. A djinn would be hella valuable, even if not exactly useful. I can't imagine they're easy to catch, at least. Probably a bit below Nundu tier.
