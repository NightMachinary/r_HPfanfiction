Oh man, hope someone comes along and recommends a good fic. This idea has always had potential, but holy geez, I have never seen it done well.

Always seems like the phoenix is some weird ass deus ex machina and because harry can "bond" with it so well, he learns some eldritch magic and slaps the shit out of Voldemort.

Bonus points if he is able to learn some sort of fire apparition, seems like a standard thing with these kinda fics.
