Yes!!!!! I have so many.

The Resolving a Misunderstanding series by MMADFan is my favorite. (linkao3(Resolving a Misunderstanding). One epic-length fic and several shorter ones. There's also two sequels, linkao3(An Act of Love) and (Death's Dominion) that are really good.

There's a veryyyyy old Albus/Minerva proboards site here that has a ton: [[https://admmfics.proboards.com/]]

Some other favorites off the top of my head: linkffn(1797731) linkao3(To Catch a Lady's Favor by muse51) linkao3(Epithalamium by Squibstress) (and the others in this series).

I'll do some thinking and share some more recs later today!
