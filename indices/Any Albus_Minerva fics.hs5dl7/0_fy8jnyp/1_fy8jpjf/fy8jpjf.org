  It's 1943, and both the wizarding and Muggle worlds have exploded into war. Eighteen-year-old Minerva McGonagall is brilliant and talented, with dreams of becoming the first witch in the Auror corps. Albus Dumbledore is famous, powerful, and haunted by his dark past. Their attraction to one another is unthinkable, inevitable, and dangerous, especially with Tom Riddle watching from the shadows. As their paths cross again and again, their lives change in ways neither anticipates, and they find they must confront the man who will become the greatest threat the wizarding world has ever known. 2013 HP Fanfic Fanpoll Award Winner Warnings for sexual content, (of-age) student/teacher, violence, language.
