It is really a matter of how you manipulate the story. Considering the Domino Effect and the chaos theory whatever the changes that would push Harry into becoming “evil” would have a deeper impact the earlier they are made though they wouldn't necessarily need to be something big, unpleasant or even a single event. In fact a serie of smaller events repeated over the course of Harry's childhood with no counter-weight could have significant impact over how Harry would take the following situations.

Fandom level of abuse regularly go over nasty straight to the point where the Nazi's would have become green in envy, it frequently just do away with any proposal of keeping it slightly realistic and put Harry through a hellish experience just to then fall in making it have any real consequence later in the story other than making him more angst and giving him power-ups. It's my belief that by uping the abuse while still inside the constraints of the society norms, psychology, time and biology and making it so that the rest of the community mostly ignore Harry or otherwise act in a /slightly/ nasty way just to then suddenly give him a sudden power-up in the form of wandless magic (nothing particularly outstanding as he would still be a child at the time) at an early enough age would work to curb him of any positive emotion directed at humanity in general, stunting significantly his empathy.

The sudden power-up with no form of law and authority to supervise it, while at first may be used mostly to get decent life-conditions, would quickly fall in a feedback loop in which Harry would justify his use of harmful magic in his relatives previous (and maybe current) treatment of him, in doing so diminishing progressively his criteria of what justifies it. This process would also be fastened by his own interest in his power and previously mentioned cultivated lack of empathy for the rest of the town-folks to the point he would come to think of them as test-subjects to train his magic instead of human being.

At this point Harry should have developed a “us versus them” mentality while still not knowing that he isn't the only one with magic, this cultivated spite for the rest of the community as a whole would come in conflict with humanity's innate need for companionship and social interaction, causing him to paradoxically crave for company while hating those who could supply him with that. If left alone for long enough, even considering that he chooses to direct his attention mostly towards training his magic, his desire for companionship would eventually override his disregard for those around him, slowly making him seek friends and eventually recognizing that the world doesn't hate him and not everyone is his enemy, though admittedly, the rest of the many psychological issues he would already have collected at this point would take much more time and profissional help to solve.

To counteract that it's essential to time and plan his Hogwarts letter and subsequent introduction to the magic world just right, it must be an almost exclusively positive experience (exclusively positive if possible) and must happen right when he is just about to swallow his pride and seek company of those around him. Hagrid taking him to get his supplies would actually be the preferable way of doing things, the likable Demi-giant with his caring nature, heart of gold and instantly regard for Harry added by his /dis/regard for the Dursley's to the point of actively cursing and intimidating them even though he admits he could get in trouble for this (thus making it a secret between him and Harry, which passes the sense of trust) would endear him to Harry while also letting him know that his own actions of magic against the Dursley's shouldn't be made public, preferentially he would confide in Hagrid that he has been essentially muggle-baiting for years only for Hagrid to dismiss it as childhood mischief and just warm him to not let the ministry know (Hagrid is shown as not particularly liking the ministry and not having a good understanding of how much something could hurt people who don't share his giant resilience, so it would even be in-character).

His introduction to the magical world at the Leek Caldron should come after he was warned of his fame so as to not be so overwhelming, having so many showing regard for his well-being after a childhood of neglect would have a positive impact in him, which he would naturally associate with the magical world while cementing his bad opinion on the muggle one and contributing to his “We against Them” mentality as he starts to count the rest of the magical world in his concept of “we”. His position would be further solidified over the trip with the good experience of discovering he have piles of money and every shopkeeper being kind and thankful to him.

Then come his contact with Draco, which is important as it is his first impression of someone at Voldemort's side. Making it in a way that Harry gets a bad impression of the blond would be ideal as it would pass on to the others in Voldemort's service, but not necessary as he would have a pre-made reason to stand against Voldemort in the form of his parent's deaths which resulted in his abuse. After it instead of going back to the Dursley's he should chose to stay at Diagon (the Cauldron works nicely for it), this should at the same time give him a chance of better acclimating himself with the wizarding world, go deeper into his magical studies and form friendships with those around him (like with Florean in the summer before third year).

Going to Hogwarts he would probably have either found out earlier from other patrons about how to get to the platform, or even find another way of getting there (the floo network for example), so chances are that there wouldn't be the meeting with the Weasley's at the beginning, but as it is honestly given much more importance than it should realistically get chances are that it wouldn't really have any effect later on. The trip is frankly not that important, making Harry meet and befriend a future Slytherin student could be used to dissuade him from bias against the house and be used as a base to make him more accepting of the Dark Arts, but again this would be something minor that could easily be achieved later on through other means.

His Hogwarts House at this point could frankly go any which way (even Grifindor or Hufflepuff, would actually be original and exciting to see a serious take on Harry walking the path of becoming a Dark Lord in a stereotypical ‘light' house, though admittedly problematic).

After that it could be taken in any direction really, the next (and last planned) great divergence point should be his conversation with Dumbledore (no magical guardian crap if possible) when the Headmaster admits being the one to put him with the Dursley's and insists that he goes back, Harry's response should be a resounding ‘HELL NO' in which he utterly refuses to even contemplate the idea and even points that Dumbledore doesn't have the authority to order him, as a 11 years-old used to being powerful and a skilled student he would completely disregard the blood-protections believing them unworthy of the price while acquiring a dislike of Dumbledore as he would have admitted having been the one responsible for all those years of abuse.

From there on the story could take many different paths, but Harry would probably still end going dark (more along the lines of Grindelwald's ideology instead of Voldemort's, I frankly can't see a realistic scenario in which cannon Harry would side with cannon Voldemort). He would end being biased against the muggles, potentially going on a extermination plan or on a plan of completely separating their worlds, but if done right he would be reluctant to side with Dumbledore while still not accepting Voldemort or his ideologies.
