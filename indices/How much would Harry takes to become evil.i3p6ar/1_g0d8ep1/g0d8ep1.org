I don't think learning about the Horcruxe sooner would really change Harry's opinion of the Order (or at least the Canon one). Most of them only knew that they had to "protect" Harry and, if you ignore Mundungus Fletcher (who I really hope had other uses), they all took their mission very seriously. In fact, the only one outside of Dumbledore who learnt the truth was Snape, and even in his case it was fairly late in the story (around HBP I think?). And considering their canon relation, I doubt it could go any worse.

I guess it could change his opinion of Dumbledore, but I doubt canon Harry would ever have joined the Dark Side. I always thought the arguments Dumbledore gave him in OotP were valid, Prophecy or not, Harry would have always fought against Voldemort, to protect his parents, and to not let anyone else grow up as an orphan like him. Knowing that his death was inevitable would not have stopped him to fight, especially since he was already willing to sacrifice during the event of PS, in his 1st year.

Of course, this opinion only apply to the canon situation, and fanon often change both the characters and their motivations, which can easily invalidate it.
