I don't think so. It is just what decent people do. Let's consider the finale of linkao3(Inner Demons by serendipity_50): there is the situation when Harry and his Auror colleague (who is unconscious at the moment) could be saved, but the magical power (or whatever it was) necessary is sufficient just for saving one (or at least Harry thinks it was so). I don't think it is anything like Harry's-saving-people-thing, but just regular human decency that he sent his colleague first, even if he believed that he is going to die for it. Multiple the situation by not saving one friend but whole nation, and the logic is even stronger. If it was really saving the world by losing Harry's life, I don't think there is any decent human person, who would say that Harry should go away from the situation and saving himself. By the way, read (or watch) any plays by Racine or Corneille, they are all about this.

The only part of the situation where Dumbledore did wrong is of course, that he didn't tell this whole situation to Harry in advance and manipulated him into accepting it. It is just plain distrust and contempt with Harry, which is deeply beneath him. However, it was his permanent trait as also shown in the way he put little Harry on Petunia's doorsteps. Again, plain human decency required to ring the bell and talk with Dursleys (and perhaps saying his condolences that Petunia's sister died while being member of The Order he led).
