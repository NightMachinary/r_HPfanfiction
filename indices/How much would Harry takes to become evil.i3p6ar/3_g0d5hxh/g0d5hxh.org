  I know a lot of you (and rightfully so) dislike the Manipulative!Dumbledork trope but would it be really out of character from Harry to resent the Order if he learns the truth about the horcrux inside him sooner?

I feel this is decisively answered in DH, where Harry does doubt Dumbledore, yet ultimately decides to do as intended. I dunno that going through this process sooner changes the outcome.

And no, Canon!Harry would not become "evil". But that's a tautology; if "Canon!Harry" were evil, he wouldn't be "Canon!Harry". So a better question is if at some point, Harry could conceivably leave the Canon trajectory, and tbh, I only see this happening before he gets sorted, so a full AU. Simply because all other questions have already been answered -- Bellatrix killed the person he was closest to, and what happened was HBP.

Which doesn't mean you can't write FF about it, of course; but by definition, this then isn't Canon!Harry anymore, or -- relative to this -- "out of character".
