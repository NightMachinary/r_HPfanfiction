  And there was a crackfic, whose name escapes me, where all of the horcruxes get a body of their own. There's crazy ass battles all over the place, culminating in an epic with Hermionemort and Harry. It's absolute crack, but was fairly entertaining from what I recall. I think Dobby merges with Harry at some point.
