I wish I could!

Unfortunately I recommended this solely off the level of gore and violence in the first chapter. I quite liked how the magic and dueling was handled, and that coupled with the gore made it seem like a good fit for OP's request.

Thing is, it's 300k words and I don't have a lot of time to read at the moment, so I can't answer your other questions. And Voice of the Nephilim in particular is an author who you can't really skim-read. His writing is pretty dense, especially in the realm of fanfiction.

I assume it's het or no ships, because it's a DLP fic and those generally aren't slash. (Modern) Popular DLP authors don't tend bash, either. So again I assume that there's no bashing here. Sorry I couldn't help more.

You might try skimming the [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/sitra-ahra-by-voice-of-the-nephilim-m.13485/][Review Thread]] for this story on the aforementioned forum. If there's any bashing or other weird stuff it'd probably be called out.
