DLP forums have their own culture, and generally the sorts of stories that are recommended there have some common characteristics.

Primarily, I'd say that they have less of a focus on shipping than is typical for fanfiction. The forum also likes stories that focus on Harry, and at least in the beginning had sort of an edge-lord tinge to it. I think the edginess has somewhat faded by now.

I will say that based on his other fics that I've read, Voice of the Nephilim is a good author. And good authors don't bash, as a general rule. So I think you're safe on that front.
