Well, its interesting enough to warrant a read, for me. And if I find shit i don't like, I'll just stop. Thanks though, even if I don't know what you mean by DLP fic (I know its a forum for writers, but what are the characteristics that define a DLP fic a DLP fic?) I'll just go by your feeling about it not being slash and not much bash (One I can't simply read it, and the other I really hate.)

Thanks .
