D.A.D.A position got cursed after he requested for the job, and he applied so he could have an excuse to hide his Horcrux - Diadem of Ravenclaw - in Room of Requirement.

I believe this is the key part, the Room is said to grant every request as long as it doesn't violate Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration, and a curse doesn't sound impossible nor related to Transfiguration. My theory is that he instructed the part of himself inside the Diadem to maintain the request of never allowing a teacher to stay for longer than a year, and that part of soul of him inside the Diadem kept that wish alive.

It seems to be the only reason as to how such a thing could be possible, and since Dumbledore probably didn't even know the existance of the Room, he couldn't have removed the Diadem. Voldemort was very angry when Dumbledore denied him the job, so I can see him marching back to Room of Hidden Things and cursing the position out of sheer spite (using Parseltongue or some way of manipulating the soul inside the object) for getting rejected and humiliated in such a fashion.
