My favourite theory was that the slightly sentient curse was placed on the DADA classroom itself(the chambers, office and furniture), subtly altering reality in such a devious way that it would persuade the resident professor to subconsciously make mistakes without noticing, eventually leading to their demise, serious wounding accident or their sacking. And it was powered by leeching power from the ambient magic and wards of Hogwarts, lingering until its casters true death, like how the Dark Marks didn't completely fade until Voldemort's soul and grasp on magic faded from the world.
