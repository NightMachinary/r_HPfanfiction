linkffn(Time to spare) has an interesting explanation.

The Hogwarts wards are doing it as a result of Tom Riddle's bout of accidental magic after being denied the position of DADA professor.

Personally, I find it stranger that no one had tried to work around the curse. Like partner with the Ministry so the Aurors teach the class on a yearly rotation; the curriculum would be consistent at least. Another possible solution is to change the name of the class to something like 'Magical Self-Defense'.

Yet another possible solution is splitting the class so every other Professor holds a 'Defense' lecture when relevant to their subject.

This is just off the top of my head, I'm sure that over the several decades the curse had been in place, a more intelligent solution could have been found,
