I don't think Lily cast any sort of spell, though. I think her sacrifice simply triggered some ancient, sort of airborne magic from this very particular circumstance of being directly offered her life and turning it down for her son. Goes with the series' love is the center of the universe thing. I don't necessarily like it, but it is what it is. And it seems very different from the DADA thing, which had nothing to do with love and I don't see how /this/ circumstance could trigger ancient airborne magic.
