I had always just considered this the canon explanation.

  “Was he after the Defence Against the Dark Arts job again, sir? He didn't say...”

  “Oh, he definitely wanted the Defence Against the Dark Arts job,” said Dumbledore. “The aftermath of our little meeting proved that. You see, we have never been able to keep a Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher for longer than a year since I refused the post to Lord Voldemort.”

The way Dumbledore phrased it always seemed to me to imply that it was the act of refusal which cast the curse - one does not deny a person as magically powerful as Voldemort without there being magical consequences.

All that said, I don't think it's particularly unusual in the HP system to place a spell on an abstract object - this is how I view the system operating generally. It is for this reason, for example, that Dumbledore couldn't just escape his curse in HBP by chopping off his hand. The /effect/ of the curse is in his hand (for the moment), but the curse itself is on /Dumbledore/ - that is, his personhood - not any physical location.
