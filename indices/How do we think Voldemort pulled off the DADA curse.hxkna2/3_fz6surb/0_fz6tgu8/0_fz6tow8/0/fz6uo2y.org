I think you and Taure have convinced me. Perhaps it's emotions that are the core of the HP universe, not just love. But I do think love is the strongest. After all surviving the killing curse is a much bigger deal than a new teacher every year, and Lily wasn't as powerful as Voldemort. But that's very interesting that such things are possible if the circumstances are right/or if the wizard is powerful enough. I'd like to see writers play around with primordial curses like that more often.
