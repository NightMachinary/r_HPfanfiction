Ah! That's something abstract that I forgot about. It seems conceptual, long-reaching curses aren't as rare as I thought.

I am a little wary of reading this one. The description seems promising, so does the DADA curse explanation. But the title... it's not one of those Lord Hadrian Potter-Peverell-Gryffindor-Slytherin fics where every character is bashed is it?
