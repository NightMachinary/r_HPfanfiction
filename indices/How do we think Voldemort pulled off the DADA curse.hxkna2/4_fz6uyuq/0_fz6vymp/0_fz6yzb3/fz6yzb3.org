Nope! The â€˜house of potter' actually refers to the actual building, not Lord Potter-something-something. There is slight Dumbledore bashing, but its more of Dumbledore being written as annoying and generally bothersome rather than Harry and co going on about how manipulative he is. This story doesn't have much of a plot/climax, the style is pretty odd, and so is the pacing, but I really liked how it doesn't stick to the stations of cannon at all, and focused Harry is on things sometimes. (he has a harry potter geek of magic vibe sometimes, just less wacky).
