Well in /The Best Revenge/ linkffn(4912291) it was a curse places on the classroom via a small set of Ancient Ruins carved somewhere people would overlook.

Technically, it was in the sequel/2nd part, /The Best Revenge: Time of the Basilisk,/ linkffn(5843959) but regardless. I had never seen a method like that used before and I thought it was neat so I'm partial to something like this. Sometimes it's the simplest things, ya know. And I'm a sucker for Ancient Ruins in fics actually being something more than a study of an archaic language.
