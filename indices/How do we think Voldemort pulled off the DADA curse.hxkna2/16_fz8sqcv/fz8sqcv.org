There was a fanfiction where he had a very specific unidentified charm or a very specific fidelis charm tied to his contribution trophy he won for saying hagrid was responsible for the chamber of secrets. I think it was a The Lone Traveler story because I think i remember Harry (The Lone Traveler) saying the only reason he found it was because he was so strong, but I might be mistaken. If I find the story i will post a edit.
