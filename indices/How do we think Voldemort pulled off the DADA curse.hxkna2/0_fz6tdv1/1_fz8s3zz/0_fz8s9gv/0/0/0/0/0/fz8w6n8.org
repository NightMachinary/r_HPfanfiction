There's a difference between the way he used Kreacher with a locket, basically as a mouth to pour the potion into, and giving an elf an instruction to act independently for a long period of time. The Jon you described requires the elf to use it's own judgement to chose the best way to dispose of the professor each year, whilst avoiding being detected by Dumbledore, who is the elf's direct employer, and therefore bound to obey.

This is the kind of agent Tom would need to trust absolutely, both in terms of competence to get the job done well, and also in terms of generally following Tom's orders absolutely. The first is unlikely due to Tom's general dismissal of elves, an the second is outright impossible due to the magic surrounding elves.

The only people I think Tom might possibly consider for a task of this magnitude are Snape or Bellatrix, neither of whom are in a position to do so. (Are they even born?)
