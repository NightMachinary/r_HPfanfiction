Can't recall which fic, but I've read one where he convinced a house elf (who was either batty, or Tom drove him batty, I can't recall) that Hogwarts would benefit from having different Defence teachers every year, so the elf would take subtle steps to bring each professor down. No one pays much attention to the elves, and being sapient, they won't be fooled by changing a job title etc.
