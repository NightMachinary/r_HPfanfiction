Interesting idea. A confundus or imperius seems more likely than a traditional /convincing/ in that case. Although Voldemort himself was one of the biggest overlookers of house elf magic, recall Kreacher in the cave. So I don't know if he would do that. And I don't see how a house elf could've influened the events without house elf magic, so he would've had to have faith in house elf magic to go this route.

Still it's a very interesting and outside the box idea. I like it. If you ever remember the fic, let me know and I'll tell the author as much myself.
