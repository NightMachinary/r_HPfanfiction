It was connected to the Diadem of course, and in my Headcanon, where each Crux requires a life and a part of yourself in sacrifice (but spilts the soul Half Way each time), it cost the life of the at-the-time DADA professor and “Acceptance” (in that nobody would ever again accept Voldie as a part of the status quo, after making it), and so it forced each following DADA professor to become “unacceptable” after a year of exposure to the Hogwarts wards.

It was bound to the Wards in a similar way to how the Map was, however that was bound to the Wards. I guess “help will always come in Hogwarts, to those who seek it” even if it's help modifying the schools Wards.
