Yeah exactly, we have precedent in the diary for a horcrux thinking for itself and carrying out a task. Plus Voldemort was in Hogwarts at the same time, getting rejected for the DADA position + hiding a horcrux, so it makes sense to combine the two. Yeah it's from a fic but I can't recall which one sorry, from what I recall, the horcrux was monitoring the wards to determine who to kill, I think Bill Weasley was the DADA professor
