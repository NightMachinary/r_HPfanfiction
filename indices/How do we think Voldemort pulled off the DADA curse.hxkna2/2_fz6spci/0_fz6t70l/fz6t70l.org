Hmmm so you mean he enchanted the diadem, like the diary, to carry out a special task besides just protecting his soul? That's interesting. And it does seem that horcruxes are much more sentient than normal enchanted objects, and thus could be capable of such feats.

Is this from a fic? If so, which fic? It's a very creative yet intuitive explanation! Though I'm still curious how it would affect the professor without physical contact, because even the diary needed that to trigger its purpose. At least at first.
