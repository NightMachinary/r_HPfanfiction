I think the curse was connected to Ravenclaw diadem. He placed it at Hogwarts when he went for the interview, and since then, they couldn't keep DADA teacher for longer than a year.\\
Just a little bonus he added to his Horcrux like with the diary (a way to open the chamber of secrets), the locket (fought when Ron tried to destroy it), or the locket (a curse).
