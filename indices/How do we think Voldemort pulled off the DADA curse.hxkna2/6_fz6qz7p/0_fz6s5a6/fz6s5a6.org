Even if it is a bad job, which it probably is, the odds of every single teacher over half a century walking out within their first year are just astronomical. You don't see it happening in the other positions. How would the DADA job be so extremely worse than the others? As you say, Dumbledore hires his friends who are perhaps not qualified. Surely he does not lack for friends and cronies so thoroughly that he couldn't find one who would be happy to stay on, as Hagrid and Snape are. And the way Dumbledore phrases it, it seems it wasn't happening year-by-year until after his interview with Voldemort. Another huge improbability. I genuinely do think there's a curse, and I'm sure there's an explanation for how it was done, crazy as it seems.

You do make a good point on the quality of Hogwarts education but I think regardless there is a curse.
