Here's a thought: maybe the DADA position /wasn't/ cursed at all.

Hear me out. We know that no one stays longer than a year, but only during Harry's time at HW are there actual psychopaths/DEs/werewolves/Ministry officials in the job. They are all there (along with the subsequent insanity) because of the plots against the BWL. Prior to that, as far as I know there weren't actual deaths, just that the profs moved on after a year.

Instead of it being a curse, it would be more realistic that HW is not a very attractive position for a respected academic. Despite everyone in Britain crowing about its reputation, what we see in canon is a school that is woefully incapable of instructing its students in the basics of spellcasting.

Examples: most wizards who attend Hogwarts cannot cast basic magic. The Shield Charm is 5th year material, and most adult wizards cannot cast it (Twins say so when marketing their Shield Hat). Enough students fail their Potions OWL that Slughorn (who has lower standards than Snape) is able to consolidate all the 6th year NEWT students into a single class. No student at HW (even Hermione) approach the level of achievement that the Marauders - who were academically gifted but not studiously inclined (spent their time pranking rather than studying) - achieved in the 70s. Harry, teaching the DA, has the students revisit old material because /they can't cast it correctly/.

All of this speaks to a school that is in real instructional crisis. When the Care of Magical Creatures professor retires, who takes that spot? Hagrid, the groundskeeper who didn't finish his own magical education. That's like if a Harvard professor retired, and the university replaced him with a landscaper that only has his GED.

If you were a competent and highly credentialed educator, why would you go to Hogwarts? It is a shit school where the Headmaster makes personnel decisions based on friendship (Hagrid) or political machinations (Snape). All of the competent faculty we see are holdovers from decades ago.

What's more likely - a nebulous curse that makes zero sense given what we know of magic, or that Hogwarts is a bad job that can't attract decent teachers?

EDIT: Before anyone says people just can't cast defensive magic because it isn't necessary, imagine that your school required 5 years of boxing classes as part of its curriculum, and that other classes frequently taught boxing strategies as part of their instruction (as Defense topics appear in Charms/Transfig). In that scenario, only a handful of students are capable of blocking a punch. What would you make of the quality of education?
