It actually wasn't a curse at all. Because of the sensitive tools in the DADA office, house elves were forbidden from cleaning in there lest their magic accidentally trigger something dangerous and put Hogwarts into lockdown.

Mold started growing in there long ago. The spores produced are poisonous and potentially lethal through prolonged exposure. The strengthened physiology of werewolves made sure Lupin survived. If the wizarding community wasn't so racist, they might have noticed vampires could survive more than a year teaching DADA too.

Dumbledore failed to find any traces of a curse because there was none. Being Supreme Mugwamp, he was too proud to admit he didn't know what was causing the problem and Voldemort became the convenient scapegoat.

Nobody ever asks the Herbology professor for her expert opinion... Seriously.
