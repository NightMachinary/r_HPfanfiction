That explains why nobody would want to take the job. But those who /do/ take it, surely they would have the fortitude to stick around? After all it would've taken a lot of courage, stubbornness or desperation to apply for such an obviously cursed job in the first place.

Also, remember that Hogwarts is the most heavily secured place in wizarding Britain. Voldemort couldn't sneak in for Harry. I don't think he could sneak in and kill a professor once, let alone 30 years in a row, professors who specialize in fighting dark forces to boot. Also it's one thing for professors to leave 30 years straight, another for them to all be obviously murdered. There would be a panic over that, that would've been mentioned at some point. As it is, it seems there is not a stereotype of the job being /deadly/, just fickle.

I do think there's a curse, and I think AshLestrange and Taure provided the best explanation (although all of them are interesting): some sort of elemental magic triggered the curse, such magic being brought on by strong and base emotions, unique situations and/or especially powerful wizards. And casting on an abstraction isn't as rare as I assumed in the op, see: taboos.
