  Also, remember that Hogwarts is the most heavily secured place in wizarding Britain. Voldemort couldn't sneak in for Harry.

  I don't think he could sneak in and kill a professor once, let alone 30 years in a row, professors who specialize in fighting dark forces to boot.

Because those professors obviously never leave the castle ...

He manged to compromise two teachers, while he was still a floating spirit thingie just fine. One of those a former auror.

  obviously murdered
#+end_quote

Who said anything about "obvious murders"? All it takes is a faked "Goodby I'm traveling the world" note, accidents happen, and so on. Voldemort might even have taken it as a challenge to see how many "perfect crimes" he can commit. After some time people start believing the position is cursed.

  But those who /do/ take it, surely they would have the fortitude to stick around? After all it would've taken a lot of courage, stubbornness or desperation to apply for such an obviously cursed job in the first place.
#+end_quote

Or don't take chances and quit after a year. Even Lupin, who is courageous, stubborn and desperate didn't plan to stick around for more than a year iirc. (Edit: I think that's fanon.)

Anyway, since you want there to be a curse :P

  You must have to be a seriously powerful wizard to manage to cast a spell on an abstract concept like a job title, let alone a powerful, long-biding curse. It must be super advanced magic.
#+end_quote

That's a lot of assumptions. I would make those same assumptions about a ritual to create a new body. Yet Wormtail of all people managed it. Who's to say that cursing an abstract concept like this isn't quite easy, but the process of how to do it is obscure/forgotten.

Sacrifice a goat under the new moon, walk 7 times backwards in a circle around it while chanting "maledictum Hogwarts defense professor" and Bob's your uncle.
