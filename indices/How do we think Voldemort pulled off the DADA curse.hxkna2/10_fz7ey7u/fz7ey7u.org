  You must have to be a seriously powerful wizard to manage to cast a spell on an abstract concept like a job title, let alone a powerful, long-biding curse.

Just to say, that you have absolutely no idea, whether this sentence canonically makes any sense. There is no such thing as “magical power” mentioned in the books, and the only difference between Tom Riddle and Gregory Goyle may be lie just in the knowledge and training, nothing about the power which could be inborn or exercised into.
