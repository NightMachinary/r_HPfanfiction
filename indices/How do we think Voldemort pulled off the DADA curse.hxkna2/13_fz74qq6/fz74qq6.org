My favourite theory is that the skeleton of dragon (or whatever that thing is) on the ceiling was spelled heavily with notice-me-not charms and DADA curse. I believe the reasoning was that nobody ever noticed or commented on that incredibly cool-looking skeleton, even muggleborns who never saw anything like it, so there has to be something fucky with that thing.
