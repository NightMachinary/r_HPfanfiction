It's easy to criticize the first 10 or so chapters. Even the author thinks it's bad, and he thinks everything he does is God's gift to the world. Also he doesn't believe in gods, but that's not really relevant. Which is not to say that what you're saying is /wrong/, just repetitive.

Try starting at somewhere like chapter 13 for more meaningful critique.
