I'm glad you X-posted this here. :)

Personally I don't think that's enough sins, the book one in particular killed me though. Although it's really weird even just seeing snapshots of the beginning chapters how different in tone it is to the rest of the fic.

I hope you continue with the rest of the fic

Also probably worth mentioning to people if you aren't familiar with the format of this to check out cinemasins on youtube (earlier videos are better and shorter).
