yes of course! Its a POA fanfic (i'll write it till the V's defeat no matter how long it will be) there's a LOT dueling and battle transfiguration and when i say a LOT it's really ALOT and i dont think there will be any bashing (ron maybe a bit but it's more laziness than bashing) There's alot mentor!McGonagall and mentor!flitwick and some mentor!dumbledore in a few years , harry is not OP but he is powerful and no romance till 5th year at least
