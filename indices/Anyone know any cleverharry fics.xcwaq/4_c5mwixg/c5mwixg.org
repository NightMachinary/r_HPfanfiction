I can't believe no one has yet linked Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived:

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Boy_Who_Lived]]

It's an academic Harry that makes every other "smart Harry" look like dumb brutes. But at the same time, Santi writes with moderation, and you never feel that his level of intelligence is ridiculous or unrealistic.

The FF.net version has 11 chapters. There's a hell of a lot more in DLP's WBA section.
