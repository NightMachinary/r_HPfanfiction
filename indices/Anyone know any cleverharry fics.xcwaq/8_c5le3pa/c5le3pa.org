Try the [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving_Connor][Sacrifices arc]] (links to 1 of 7, all 7 are completed). Harry is at least smart and powerful, even if you want to beat him over the head for not always learning from his mistakes. Eventual HP/DM.

I've been working my way through this for about a month. My favorite parts are the pureblood dances... Worth reading for the detail and awesomeness the author creates for the dances alone.
