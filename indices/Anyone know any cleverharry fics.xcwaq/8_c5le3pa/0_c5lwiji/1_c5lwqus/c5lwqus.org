Agreed. I read almost all of the first book with one eyebrow raised, but Lightning won me over eventually. The good outweighs the bad. I love the pureblood rituals and the /vates/ aspects (I hope I can say that without it being a spoiler?) of this story a lot, but I tend to skim whatever Harry's latest emotional/mental drama is.
