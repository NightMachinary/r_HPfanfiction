Sacrifices Harry starts off extremely one-sided and boring, but he gets somewhat intelligent and things get interesting around the third book. Lightning should also be commended for writing probably the only complete AU septology.

Environment and setting (those pureblood rituals are insanely detailed and thought-out) are pluses, constant emotional breakdowns and unintelligent self-sacrificial morals, not so much.
