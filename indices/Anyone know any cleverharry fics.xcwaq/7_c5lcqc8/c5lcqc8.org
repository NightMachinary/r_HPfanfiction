Hm...

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2358016/1/This_Means_War][This Means War!]] maybe?

Kinda a romantic comedy that morphs into action/adventure, I'd say. Parts with canon after book 5, I'd say? Starts off with prank wars that snowball into bigger stuff. Uses the wonderful M-Mail system that sometimes pops around (wizard email, essentially).
