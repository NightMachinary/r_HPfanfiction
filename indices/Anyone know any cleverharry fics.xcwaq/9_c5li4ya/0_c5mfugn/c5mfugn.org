I'm only on chapter 8, and having just read his right and wrong spiel after making a bunch of teenagers sign their magic away should any situation arise where they have to help the dark lord (such as a family member being taken hostage, etc) I really feel that that sense of morality is not something most people will agree with.

What he's basically doing is any time there's ever a threat, all you have to do is make every single magical wizard in the country sign a contract. Anyone who doesn't sign it is obviously evil and therefore arrested.

It's just a really horrible thought/system (and abuse will happen instantly (just put lots of secret clauses in like he did and you have every wizard as your slave), and it bothers me that he'd start by having a 15 year old sign away her magic and life so she can take down a bothersome teacher.
