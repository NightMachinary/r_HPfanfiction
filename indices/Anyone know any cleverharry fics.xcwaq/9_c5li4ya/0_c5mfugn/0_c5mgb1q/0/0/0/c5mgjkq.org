No, because even if I am okay with the War Mage's right and wrong happening to be okay with that kind of contract, then it still is an issue that it's never used by anyone else.

If you don't mind morally doing something like that, then you should have every single person in the wizarding world sign it.

Harry on his own, single-handedly by making them SIGN THEIR NAME removed every member of the houses bar Slytherin from ever working with Voldermort. Even in the even where V won they still would lose their magic and then die just by working with him.

And even assuming that Harry for some reason only is okay with doing it to school children and not the wizarding world at large, Voldermort certainly won't have that kind of moral obligation. If compulsion contracts really existed then he would have used them to make sure that no death eater can spy on him, and also make anyone they capture obey him completely or die.
