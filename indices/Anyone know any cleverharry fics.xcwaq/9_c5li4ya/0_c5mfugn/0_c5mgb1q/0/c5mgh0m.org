Of course, but the implication is that HP isn't Lord Voldie reincarnate. Indeed, if the compulsion contract could do that then Lord Voldie should just make all his followers sign a contract that says if they spy on him they lose their magic.

So I'm really unhappy about it's inclusion, because there's no way it can exist without it being abused by someone else and I doubt that's going to retroactively be added. It's just a huge oversight to include something that basically is:

If you sign this, if you don't do X you will die.

If you don't sign it, you are an enemy and we will kill you.

The prospects of abuse for that system is unbelievable, and the obvious implication is that Harry would have no problem making everyone sign one (but you say he doesn't do that and that's a serious inconsistency) and they'll also have to justify why Lord V never thought of it.

  but I will say it doesn't sound like a consistent extension of what I remember happening in the fic.

Well the idea is there, I assume the writer wouldn't follow it because it's pretty obviously not a morally right thing to do.
