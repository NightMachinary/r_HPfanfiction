You never said anything about laudable morals. Fanfiction authors (even the good ones) tend to be susceptible to not being age-appropriate with their characterisations.

I just liked the way they examined the physical basis for magic.

I should note that I haven't read it in several years, so I can't address your hypothetical about signing away the magic of every wizard in England, but I will say it doesn't sound like a consistent extension of what I remember happening in the fic.
