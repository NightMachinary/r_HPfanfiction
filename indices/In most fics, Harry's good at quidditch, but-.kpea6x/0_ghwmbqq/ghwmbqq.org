While I haven't seen this, your request reminded me of a gag in linkffn(The Gates of Azkaban) where Harry's friends tell James about how utterly hopeless Harry is on a broom, much to James' utter horror. It was a rather amusing moment in that fic. The premise of the fic, for context, is that post-war Hermione, Harry, some of his friends, and an alive Snape, travels to an AU version of 1980 (It's not a LESS fic, despite what the character list might imply -- it's Jily, among other things. Figured I'd mention it given the kind of fics I usually read).
