Yes, let's take the only thing which he was really good in canon.\\
If you compensate this with something else then ok. In many fics where he has other strengths or is a time traveler he doesn't play quiditch and that's ok. But if you take that away from him (and thus a large part of the story revolveting around quiditch ) then his main ability is his shitty luck. I understand your point and I think fics where he is just good at everything are just as bad, there has to be a balance.\\
Take one, give him something else.\\
It has to be story interesting, I think that's how many ideas for fics arise.
