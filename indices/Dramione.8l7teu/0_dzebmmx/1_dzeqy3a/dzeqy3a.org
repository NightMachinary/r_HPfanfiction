She also has another called hunted that's really good. Or there's a couple by heartofaspen that are really good, like eagle's nest, by it's not complete. Colubrina has some really good ones as well, for slytherin hermione or pureblood hermione. I recently reread presque toujours pur by shayalonnie, which is a good pureblood hermione one. Plus there's some time travel ones I've read too if that's what you like. Dramione is my otp so I've read tons!
