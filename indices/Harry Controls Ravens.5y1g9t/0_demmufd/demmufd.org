In linkffn(The art of self-fashioning), Harry is a transfiguration prodigy and he conjures animals, including ravens, quite often. His creations are particularly useful in battles, but they also spy for him, do some reconnaissance, etc. If you're familiar with the web serial "Worm", it's sort of like Taylor using her bugs to track people. It's an excellent story, very well written although Harry is quite overpowered.
