It is annoying, but it's also somewhat understandable, since apparently someone was spamming new accounts and then ripping off fics from the WBA section and posting them on FFN as his own. I don't quite know how their new policies are intended to combat this (other than raising the barrier to access said fics slightly), but I don't much care as long as I have access without anything overly tedious.

tl;dr: It's less of a hassle and more effective to take the steps to gain access than it is to complain about it.
