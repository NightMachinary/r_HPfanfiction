Yes, they can be found on DLP under the Works By Author section. You'll need an account and a valid posting history (I believe it required ~7 posts) before you can access it, so a 2-3 day effort if you're willing. I think there's an additional 6 chapters (takes it partway into the Triwizard Tournament) or so to be found there that can't be found on FFN.
