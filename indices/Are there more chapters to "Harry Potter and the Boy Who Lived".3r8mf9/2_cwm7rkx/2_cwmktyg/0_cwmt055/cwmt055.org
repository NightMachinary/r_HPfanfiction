If you based your entire use of the WbA section around thread ratings then you're doing it wrong. The appeal and benefit of WbA is the replies.

However, let's go with your 'use' of the forum which treats ratings as basically the review counter on FF.net.

If your thread has been consistently rated 3-5 stars and averages around 4 stars, and then suddenly you take a deep dive to 2 stars, with no apparent reason, then clearly either a) someone doesn't like your story at all, or b) as you say, someone is downvoting it out of spite/troll.

Actually, this reminds me of something. Were you the guy that messaged all the Moderators with an in-depth private message detailing how the system could be abused, and then when we assured you that it was so uncommon it was downright impractical to 'guard against', that you went ahead and down voted every story in the library to 'prove your point'?
