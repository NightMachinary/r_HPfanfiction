You say elitest like it's a bad thing. It really isn't. Holding people to a standard only increases drive and ability in the long run.

Plenty of DLP writers want to transition to being professional authors, some have succeeded. They aren't going to get there without proper criticism and high standards.

If it's not for you, than that's fine, but there's a reason a disproportionate amount of great fics in the fandom come from DLP writers, and that many outside writers come to improve.
