There's actually a lot of good stuff to be found in the Works By Author section, works that can't be found elsewhere, so I would recommend exploring if you like fics of similar quality to HP&tBWL.

Further, though this aspect doesn't really require an account except to contribute your own vote, they have a pretty extensive archive of already-screened works, so you don't have to wade through as many badfics as you would if you just browsed the FFN archive.
