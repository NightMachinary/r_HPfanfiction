All that stands in its Path!

I was not ready to cry tonight. No idea why it got me so hard, but I'm sobbing.

Jesus.

Edit - the way back home too! Fantastic This is why I love fanfiction. I've read way over 10 million words of HP fanfiction, but everynow and again something like this just gets me.

Thank you
