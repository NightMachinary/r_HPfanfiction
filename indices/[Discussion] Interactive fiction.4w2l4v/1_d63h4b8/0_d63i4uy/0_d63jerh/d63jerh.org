Okay, so quests are sort of like online choose-your-own-adventure stories. The author writes a chapter, and then gives the community of reader/commenters a vote on what the characters should do next or whatever. The author writes the next chapter based on what they voted for, and offers the readers their next vote, and etc. Quest choice systems can be complicated with points and scores and that sort of thing, or they can just be the author telling the commenters to write what they want the characters to do, or something else. It's up to the author. I don't really read Harry Potter quests, so I can't recommend any specific ones. Spacebattles and Sufficient Velocity are forums that both have relatively large sections for quests. Here are the links to the [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/forums/roleplaying-quests.60/?order=post_date][Spacebattles]] and [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/forums/quests.29/][Sufficient Velocity]] quest sections. Unfortunately, there is not a good way to sort by fandom, so there are also quests for lots of other fandoms besides Harry Potter on their. Sorry about that.
