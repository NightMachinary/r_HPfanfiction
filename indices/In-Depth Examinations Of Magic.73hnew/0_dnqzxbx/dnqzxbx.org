List below contains, generally, a studious Harry & expansions on the canonically defined magic & magic systems (though sometimes highly AU). These are all pretty much common recs (for the most part), but I can't think of anything else right now.

Wit of the Raven, linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2740505/1/Wit-of-the-Raven]]) - fantastic stuff, pretty AU.

Prince of the Dark Kingdom, more info on some magic, expands on magical religion, etc., linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom]]).

There's the Pureblood Pretense series, of course, for potions; linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/]]).

Even more obvious choice, but Harry Potter & The Boy Who Lived, linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived]])

The Art of Self-Fashioning, of course, for transfiguration, linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11585823/]]).

HP & The Untitled Tome, generally more studious & different magic; linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10210053/]]).

HP & The Accidental Horcrux, more studious, expansion on some magic; linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11762850/]])

Death of Today, linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5402147/1/Death-of-Today]]) - slash, but I recall there being fairly detailed examinations of magic, inventions, etc.

C'est La Vie, runes, linkffn([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3390668/]]).
