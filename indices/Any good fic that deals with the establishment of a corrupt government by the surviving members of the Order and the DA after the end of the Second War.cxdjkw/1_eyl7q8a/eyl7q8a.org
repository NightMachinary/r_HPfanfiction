  despite that even the Cursed Child portrays him as quite incompetent (he longs for adventure but neglects his responsibilities) and hiding behind the public's worship for Harry - he basically creates an indirect cult of personality

Please, let's not drag Harry's characterization from that awful fanfic into play. Even JKR openly declared that the author Jack Thorne projected his own childhood daddy issue into Harry's character:

#+begin_quote
  MARK PHILLIPS: The ideas for the books came from you. The ideas for the movies came from the books. This was extending the story into the future. Who did that? Which of the three of you was most responsible for the storyline as it weaves its way into the future?

  J.K. ROWLING: The developing the story, I think, was very collaborative between the three of us. I, for obvious reasons, had power of veto over everything. I could say, "No, that didn't happen." But no, it was the three of us. But the play is Jack's play. Jack did the writing. Jack did the heavy lifting. And he did it beautifully. And I couldn't be happier.

My own one shot [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12925628/1/Interview-with-Director-Potter][Interview with Director Potter]], linkffn(12925628), written for the occasion of Battle's 20th anniversary, has probably what you want. They are definitely playing hardballs with their enemies.

With respect to "Skeeter Conspiracy" mentioned in that fic, here is a little scene I wrote:

[Hermione's Office, British Ministry of Magic, the Day After]

  Hermione: Well, Ginny, it seems you have gotten yourself really into trouble this time.

  Ginny: You got a problem with that, Hermione? I thought better of you. This Skeeter bitch stepped over the line and I taught her a lesson. I regret nothing!

  Hermione: Calm down, Ginny. My staff told me that several opinion pieces calling for your head appeared on Daily Prophet as soon as the game was over. Almost too fast in my opinion, as if they had anticipated your response.

  Ginny: What? You mean that I had been set up?

  Hermione: Possibly, so far we have no proof, and Skeeter hasn't woken up yet. Your really put some power into your hex. It could have killed her.

  Hermione: Anyway, I have already mobilized our Network to stage a rally outside the Daily Prophet's Diagon Alley office later today. They will be calling for Skeeter's head instead and demanding an end to her slanderous pieces. Luna and Lee will soon publish their articles about possible conspiracy. They will encourage her slander victims to make a stand. Once the accusations are coming in, we will have a valid pretext to bring her in. Harry, you need your Aurors to put Skeeter under â€˜protection' soon. We couldn't afford some of our radical followers to harm her, and we couldn't let whoever are behind her to silence her.

  Harry: Thank you Hermione, you are always a step ahead of me. I love you.

  Harry: So, you believe there is a conspiracy behind her sudden attack against us?

  Hermione: Again, no proof yet. Once she wakes up, you will be conducting your standard procedure. It's better to be overcautious one hundred times than to let our guard down once. Constant Vigilance!

  Ginny: If there was a conspiracy, I doubt her backers would have exposed their true identities. They would be all polyjuiced anyway.

  Harry: Then we just have to be clever about it. I'm sure Hermione had already put her thought into this matter.

  Hermione: First, we need to establish that Skeeter is part of a conspiracy, which I'm very certain about it. This will change the public narratives and give us the initiative. I will coordinate with our friends in the DoM to step up our surveillance effort, and we will make a big splash in the press and on the street. That should hopefully scare off our enemies into doing something stupid, so we can catch them in the act. Harry, you know what to do.

  Harry: Well, let's get started then!

[DMLE Interrogation Room #4, Several Hours Later]

#+begin_quote
  Skeeter: You can't do this to me! I shall expose you all! This is a blatant abuse of power...

  Auror 1: Cut the crap, Skeeter. We know everything about you. Let's see what we've got here... Yes, 157 accusations of slander and defamation, more coming in by the hours. Well, you already confessed under Veritaserum that you were bribed by certain subversive elements to set up Mrs Potter. Of course, we know you are an illegal animagus too.

  Skeeter: Granger. She kidnapped me back then, held me captive for two weeks, and then still had the nerve to blackmail me. I will let the whole world know what she did...

  Auror 1: Nobody cares. Madam Granger is a great war hero and reformer, and you are just one yellow press journo who lied, slandered, and pandered to the lowest of the rabbles. Whom is the world going to believe? Besides, what happened during the War is all covered under Minister Shacklebolt and Wizengamot's Blood War Exemption Act. You were conspiring with Lucius Malfoy back then to commit character assassinations of Headmaster Dumbledore, Mr Potter, and Miss Granger. So you were basically one of them who had escaped justice for too long! But no more, we now have enough evidence to send you to Azkaban forever.

  Auror 1 pulled out a jar and a let a beetle out, and crushed it with his fist.

  Auror 1: Skeeter, now it's time to carefully consider your options. Fully cooperate with us for leniency, or end up worse than this beetle.

  Skeeter after a long pause: If I fully cooperate, how much leniency can I expect? And how do I cooperate?
