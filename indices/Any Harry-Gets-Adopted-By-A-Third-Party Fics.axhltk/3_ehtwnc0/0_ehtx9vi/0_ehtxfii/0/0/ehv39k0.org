Harry Crow is pure Gary Stu power fantasy. I mean he can do wandless transfiguration with a knife in his first year and McGonagall is so astounded she claims he just rewrote the basic theories of transfiguration or something stupid like that. In a later chapter Harry is literally wearing a full suit of golden plate armor in like 3rd year.

As I said, completely ridiculous.
