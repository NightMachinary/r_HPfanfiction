surprised no one's mentioned linkffn(The Perils of Innocence) yet. Harry is abandoned at a sort of behavioral center for children at a young age by the Dursleys and is later joined by Hermione and Dean there. Hasn't been updated in a long while but the author says it's not abandoned so we'll have to see.
