I'm writing one where he is adopted by the Tonks family after a slightly different 3rd year. Not a lot of action, mostly just family and friendship moments. And since I'm going for a realistic divergence, Harry won't suddenly be a different person overnight. No switching to runes or suddenly being the top student in anything other than DADA. No bashing, but some shade at "incompetent adults".
