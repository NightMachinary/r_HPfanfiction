The only character I really throw shade at is Pomfrey for not noticing how Harry had been treated before Hogwarts. But even then it is "she is incompetent" and not "she eats kittens for breakfast" even if in-story there are some thoughts whether it was incompetence or malice. Neville is a dick towards Harry, but it makes sense due to the small issue of Bellatrix Lestrange, Andromeda not particularly caring what her sister did and Harry being very grateful towards Andromeda.
