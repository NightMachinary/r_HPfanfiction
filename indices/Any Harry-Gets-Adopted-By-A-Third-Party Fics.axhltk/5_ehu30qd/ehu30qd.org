Reccing [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent][Innocent]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]] in case you haven't seen them, but they get mentioned pretty often here.

Innocent is "what if Sirius escaped Azkaban early and adopted Harry" (and a couple other points of divergence: the Malfoys have two sons) with some interesting plot - Greyback is quite a compelling villain. Has several sequels, currently in fourth year, which are a bit canon-rehash-y but still enjoyable.

Accidental Animagus is White Squirrel's take on a Lord Potter fic (lots of pureblood politicking and the like) with the Grangers adopting Harry after he runs away from the Dursleys. He likes to take tropey premises and try to do them justice, so give it a chance even if Lord Potter isn't your thing.
