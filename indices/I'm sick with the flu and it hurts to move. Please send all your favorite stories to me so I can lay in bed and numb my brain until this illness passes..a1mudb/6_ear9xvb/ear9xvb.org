Are you more interested in quality or quantity?

I just caught up with linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor), which was a good laugh. You'll probably appreciate it better if you're familiar with Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, but most of it still works anyway, you'd just miss some references (and HPMoR is rather long).
