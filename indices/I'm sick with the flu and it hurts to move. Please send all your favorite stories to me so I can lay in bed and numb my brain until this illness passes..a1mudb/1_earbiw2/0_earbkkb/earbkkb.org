  The first time I heard the word ‘Hogwarts' and it actually registered, I was fifteen, halfway through my second apprenticeship, and I sat down very hard. For almost a full hour. Then I ‘ported to my mother's place. She took one look at me and steered me to sit down in the kitchen, shoving my head between my knees till she could get me a compress and a mug of sweet tea.“What did you Remember?” she asked.I made vague groaning noises and tilted my head up enough to gulp some tea. Where to begin? “I remembered a book,” I said haltingly. “In the book. There was a school. The school was called ‘Hogwarts' and they taught magic. It was an adventure series, centered on a boy and his friends. I loved the books. Devoured them. I had forgotten.”“Why are you so upset about Remembering this?”I pulled the compress from my face. “Mom, Hogwarts is a real school here.”

  Tom Riddle received a thorough education in magic, cultivated an influential following, and secured his immortality. He then disappeared into the Muggle world and was quickly convinced that, left unchecked, Muggles were certain to doom the entire planet. Tom returned a decade later with a careful strategy for world dominion. He succeeded. By the time a young Harry Potter, Heir to his Name and ward of the Malfoy family, is handed a wand at the traditional age of eight, he stands to inherit a modest territory of 25,000 square kilometers and eight thousand restless Muggle subjects.
