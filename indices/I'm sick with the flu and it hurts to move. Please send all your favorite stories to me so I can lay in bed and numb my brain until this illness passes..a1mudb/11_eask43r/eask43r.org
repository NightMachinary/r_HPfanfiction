The Shadow of Angmar by SteelBadger linkffn(11115934)

I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For by kathryn518 linkffn(11157943)

DogheadThirteen/Cal's excellent "The Scourge from the North". Sadly, it's currently only posted in the CaerAzkaban Yahoo group. They're pretty free with accepting new people though.

The "Enter the Dragon" started and abandoned by DogheadThirteen linkffn(5585493), and is now being continued, with author's permission by Dunkelzahn on the CaerAzkaban Yahoo group, though he's cross posting less frequently on Questionable Questing.

Also, most everything by DogbertCarroll.
