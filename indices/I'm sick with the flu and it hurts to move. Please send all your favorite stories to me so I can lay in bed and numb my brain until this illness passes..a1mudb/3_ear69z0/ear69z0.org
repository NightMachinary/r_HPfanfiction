I just finished [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2233473/1/Latet-Anguis-In-Herba][Latet Anguis in Herba]] and have started on its sequel, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3353818/1/Shade-to-Shade][Shade to Shade]].

These two stories are OC fics, set during the Golden Trio's time at Hogwarts, but this group of four Slytherins almost never interacts with them. At first glance, that may not seem like a great fanfiction recommendation, but it's just fantastic. It's A+ writing, A+ character-development, and I was completely hooked after the first two chapters. It's the perfect thing to read while sick.
