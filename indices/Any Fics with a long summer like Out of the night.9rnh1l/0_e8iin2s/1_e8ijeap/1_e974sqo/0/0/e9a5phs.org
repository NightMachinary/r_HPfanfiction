No worries, I actually just finished it. Definitely similar vibes as Summer of Change, but original enough to stand on its own and is clearly only inspired by it. It's not as well written but has plenty of unique ideas and I enjoyed it. I was also disappointed by the lack of a promised sequel but oh well.
