[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9720211/17/The-Merging][Chapter 17 of The Merging]] has Harry visit an alternate reality where his parent's are alive.

Though, If you're okay with the meeting being the result of dimension travel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4180686/1/Across-the-Universe][Across the Universe]] is a oneshot about that.

There's also a few fics where Harry finds out they aren't actually dead, but left the magical world behind after their son died. Hilarity, angstifying, and usually Dumbledore bashing generally follows as both Harry and his parents start shouting "you're not dead!?" but I can't recall titles to link to them. I think Hermione is pregnant in one of them? so YMMV.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7144149/1/Not-Normal][Not Normal]] by radaslab has Harry find his parents in stasis because (shock! surprise!) Lily planned ahead.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6780275/1/The-Last-Casualties][The Last Casualties]] has James and Lily punted forward in time instead of killed by Voldemort. They come running into the castle very confused during Harry's fourth? year.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4198643/1/Timely-Errors][Timely Errors]] instead has Harry going back to his Parent's time via a stable time loop... Which it occurs to me may mean that Harry Potter was his own namesake.
