Thank you for a very complete answer. I'll answer point by point:

- Acromantulas. My line of thinking was to have the eldest son of Aragog (whom I call Belobog) take control of the Acromantula colony after the death of Mosag in the Battle of Hogwarts. Using the vast numbers of Acromantula deaths in the Battle, he makes them see they cannot keep living like savages and yet hope to face wizards successfully; he builds them into a civlization, regaining contact with Hagrid, who is all too happy to help, and Luna, who doesn't see anything problematic about this. Bottom line, I think of them as basically primitive humans who aren't born man-eating, but tend to blindly follow their instincts because they're not civilized at all.

- I like your ideas on Hags, but I'm not sure they work with canon. I recall there was a Society for the Reformation of Hags. How could such a thing exist if Hags literally need human flesh to survive? And I was wondering how you'd suppose Hag society was set up.

- Again, your answer on Vampires doesn't really answer my question. What do you think vampires are like? How do they live? How could they be made to reform and become a part of wizarding society? (Also, do you think that HP vampires are cursed like in old legends, or a separate species?)

- Dementors: as I said, I already have plans for those. I'm counting on education. Dementors need emotions, but they don't have to eat souls to survive. I'm thinking of 'civilized' Dementors, who survive through blood-bank-style organizations where people are paid to sit in the presence of a Dementor for half an hour, allowing them to feed on their momentary happiness.

- Sphinxes and Manticores... you precisely touch on the subject I was thinking of. How do you think their populations are set up? Do they live in clans, solitary, etc? Do they have their own languages? Etc.

Also, you didn't say anything about trolls and Merpeople.
