I'm not gonna tell you how to write your fic, but there is something I wanted to say about Dementors. Dementors bothered me for the longest time, and it wasn't until not long ago that I figured out why. Consider this:

- The Dementors on the train gravitate towards Harry because of his bad memories? Not towards a group of happy kids?

- Dementors feed on good thoughts, but the only defense against them...is good thoughts?

- Dementors are used as Azkaban guards, despite the fact that there's no happiness in Azkaban to speak of?

What we're told about Dementors is /completely/ at odds with what we actually see from them. I don't know if this is nonsensical writing on Rowling's part, or an in-universe misunderstanding, but the available facts of Dementors simply do not add up.
