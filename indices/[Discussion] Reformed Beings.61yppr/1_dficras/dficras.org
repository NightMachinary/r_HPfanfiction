Acromantulas are tricky. While certainly of human intelligence, they are unmistakably predators, much higher on the food chain, and have murderous instincts. Aragog was tame for lack of a better word, because he was raised by humans from birth. Any other Acromantulas would be hostile and indeed try to eat Wizards.

Hags require some restrictions. (Headcanon) they are magical humanoids who can practice blood magic, sympathetic magic, and old magic in that they can lay down curses, blight crops and work weather. They eat human flesh, both for magical power and to increase their lifespan, and it must be regular. The ministry has laws against eating wizards, but muggles are fair game as long the hags aren't caught. Notable examples include the villains of Grimm's fairy tales, such as the witch from Hansel and Gretel, and the witch from Rapunzel.

Vampires are easy. They have some magical talents such as hypnosis, and extra physical abilities, but they generally keep to themselves and are under rules similar to hags. Wizards in a fight with a vampire will almost always win, except in the case of being surprised.

Dementors are super difficult, because they are amortal. They can't be killed, and live ridiculously long. They employ empathetic magic to feed on sentience, and can steal souls. While they can be bargained with, there isn't much to offer them, and they can't exactly be threatened. The only way found to kill them is by using a Necromancer, or freezing the Dementor solid, and physically carrying them to the ministry to push them through the Veil.

Sphinxes are pretty easy. They are of human intelligence, and while carnivorous, don't need to hunt humans exclusively. I could easily see treaties made with Sphinx clans to hire some out to guard treasure for example.
