If you're going for rational use of the Stone, I think the most likely answer is to leave it lost in the forest.

Either it's a dangerous artifact created by a powerful wizard who killed himself after seeing false images of loved ones. The images were merely reconstructions of his memory. Legend around it grew, and it was falsely labeled a stone of resurrection.

Or it's an actual gift from Death, a tricky trap meant to guide people to their deaths. A being like Death would be very aware that seeing dead loved ones plays havoc on reasoning and emotion; I suspect the stone's effect would be similar to the Mirror of Erised's, depriving the user of any other desire. The only positive use for it in canon is to help Harry, Master of Death, become a sacrifice and not lose his will on the way to Voldemort. All other times it was used, Death claimed the user.

In both cases, the Stone seems very dangerous without deviating away from canon. And I think that's fitting. Magic is magic; it's fantastical and sometimes dark. Even if everyday lives are "solved" and "all is well", wouldn't there still be corner cases and deep mysteries to keep things fun?
