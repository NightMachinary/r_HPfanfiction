There's a third possibility, which is the one I'm thinking of --- it was built by Cadmus Peverell rather than given by Death, but it actually summons souls of the dead, not reconstructions. At any rate, my point is precisely to use it to summon /other/ people than loved ones. To have it used by an organization rather than by a specific person.
