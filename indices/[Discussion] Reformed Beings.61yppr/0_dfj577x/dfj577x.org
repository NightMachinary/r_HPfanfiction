If it's not in the [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page][Harry Potter Wiki]] then generally neither

- Books
- Pottermore
- The fantastic beast movie script
- Cursed child
- Interviews
- Tweets
- The fantastic beast movie
- The other movies
- The games

gave any information about a subject. The Wiki is rather complete to my knowledge, I haven't found any trivia that wasn't at least referenced there (except for shortly after the release of the FB movie, but that was rectified quickly).

Then the next way to go is: "What legends exist around these things?" and then just adjust them to fit your story.
