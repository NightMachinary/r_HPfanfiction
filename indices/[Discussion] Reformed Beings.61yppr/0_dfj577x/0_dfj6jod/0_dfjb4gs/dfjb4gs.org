There is the saying "In every legend is a sparkle of truth". They are often portrayed as guardians and asking riddles, and that is how Rowling used them. What other properties do they have in the myths? As you mentioned, made by gods. Also, they have huge statues in Egypt.

I'll make an example, it's not be perfect, but it's what I came up with after 10 minutes of research:

  In the modern day no one is quite sure where the Sphinx come from, but most scholars agree that the Sphinx is native to Egypt. Egypt was only really populated with Wizards during the time of Pharaohs (the first Egypt wizards) so little record exists - it is known that before the pharaohs they were the strongest creature around (magical or not). Though generally peaceful, ancient wizards were only barely a match to the strength of a provoked sphinx'. Indeed, Ilaran, secondborn son of a Pharaoh is recorded noting that he'd "rather be locked in his father's pyramid than facing another one of /these/". This strength lead the them having an almost royal status and getting their own monuments in front of the pyramids as a sign of goodwill and peace.

  Indeed the legend of the Sphinx' made it's way all the way south to India, where they were confused with Cows - the real reason why the Cow is holy in India. Modern Sphinx claim to find this story funny, yet Cow has been on of their favorite desserts since they heard about it.

  The average Sphinx has a lifespan of a few hundred years, and being very content creatures they had little problems with the statue of secrecy. As long as they are near other beings and can guard something and ask riddles they have little needs, and readily admit this themselves. While Sphinx are undoubtedly fond of Riddles they also love jokes and puns, and if in the mood, can give valuable insight.

So I kept the "Riddle" and "Guardian" part, took something completely unrelated from culture (Cows in India) made up that the Pharaohs were the first wizards (which isn't that improbable for all we know) and gave a reason for the monumental statues of the Sphinx (its for that day incredible strength). Simply try to give it /personality/ - that is what Rowling did with everything in the magical world and it worked quite well.
