Trolls dont seem to be much smarter than the dumbest humans if you want to include them as getting along with other beings you would have to increase their intelligence or put them under the effects of caliming draught basically all the time vampires in harry potter seem to be a seperate speciese because they can breed with humans and produce half vampires, dont seem to get much older than wizards( in a videogame two vampires are listed as dying at around 200).There are also sweets that tasted like blood in Honeydukes for vampires so its entirely possible that vampires dont need blood to survive but merely have a liking for the taste. So its easy to supply them with blood of willing donators and generally produce more blood tasting food.

You could do the same with hags that they simply like the taste of raw meat like werewolves do and favor the taste of human children but not every hag has to eat humans like not every werewolf hast to be like Greyback and eat humans. For their powers I wouldn't give them many powers they could use without a wand, mostly first year Charms and being good and Herbology and Potions. I think Merpeople do already get allong with wizards but have problems comucating with wizards on land because of their biology and the lack of wizards who learn their language. So you could just say a new potion or enchanted object was created that allows them to talk human languages outside of water.
