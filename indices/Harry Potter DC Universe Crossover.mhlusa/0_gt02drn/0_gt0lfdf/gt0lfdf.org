It's super hilarious. Especially as Harry is a clueless, bumbling idiot, but everyone treats him as if he's the Devil. It's a stupefyingly side-splitting comedy of errors. It even hints at some point that he might have some connection to the Devil or something on this new world, but that was never explored after the fic was abandoned.
