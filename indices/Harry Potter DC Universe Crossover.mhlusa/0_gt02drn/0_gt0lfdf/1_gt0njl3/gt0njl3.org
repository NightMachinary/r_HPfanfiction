IIRC there was another chapter on the old Caer Azkaban site, but it wasn't ported over to groups.io. The author basically wrote himself into a corner and started to introduce anime elements to try to keep it going, like using adrenaline on someone who's flat-lining and failing miserably. Still, it was utterly hilarious while it lasted (the odd HP couplings aside at the start).
