Nabu (or is it Naabu?) is a Lord of Order occupying the Helmet of Fate: it's not a horcrux/soul jar type thing.

Although the MoD thing has been done to death, a trope subversion could be pretty cool:

He arrives but instead of moping rolls with the hand dealt to him, and he settles onto DC Earth: he gets a job, rents an apartment or house, and settles into to something he craved: normalcy.

Unfortunately to people who are knowledgeable about, study, or are "in-the-know", it looks like something straight out of Lovecraft's higher deities has just decided to randomly stop by their world and... settle down like a normal mortal, for some reason.

So they, such as the League, Constantine, and the more evil magical elemeents like Ras'a'Ghul, watch him from a distance, feeling disconcerted.

And that's not counting on the deities, like the Olympians or even the New Gods like Apokalypse, freaking out about something so /alien/ just chillaxing in the mortal world.

What'd be more amusing? He starts dating a junior League member, like Kara or Courtney, in their civilian life after meeting them in a normal way (such as asking for their number after they meet a coffee shop, or something), and no-one makes the connection until later on.

I think Terminal Justice had something like this, albeit in a very vague way, and there was a Harry Potter/Buffy crossover where he starts dating Dawn but they all think he's literally Lucifer walking about on Earth, doing random shit.
