Filters I use:

1. English, because it is the only language I can +barely+ speak

2. Updated within 24 Hours, so it is easier to see if anything interesting has updated recently.

3. Rating: All, because Dad rented The Terminator for me when I was way too young for it to be appropriate.

4. With Harry, because in general, Hary-centric is all I care aboot [sic].

5. Without Draco M. and Severus S. not because I dislike them, but it cuts the most slash out (and I'm not interested in that).

I just wish you could filter by words/chapter.
