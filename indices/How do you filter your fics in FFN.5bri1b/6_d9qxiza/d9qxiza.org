For a first viewing I choose "Sort by" filters, either by Reviews, Favorites or Follows. Srcoll down a bit to get over the FFN circlejerks (such infamous monstrosities as Harry Crow and Partially Kissed Hero can be found on page 1) and you'll find some decent new-ish fics hanging around.

Then I add pairing filters. Genre is, in my opinion, a filter defeated by the fact that often genres are not correctly applied. Much more indicative of a story is the character cast.

And from there its just summaries and the first few paragraphs.
