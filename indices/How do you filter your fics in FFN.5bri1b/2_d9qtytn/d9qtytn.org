Sort: Update Date Time Range: All (Usually I check it often enough that I don't need a specific time range) Genre A/B: All (Not picky) Rating: All or M (If there was a setting for T+M I would use it) Length: >20,000 (I like to read novel style mostly) Status: All World: All Character A: Harry Potter (I have trouble getting into stories that aren't based on Harry, especially next gen) Character B/C/D: Usually not selected, on occasion I'll select a pairing I'm interested in.

Without Character A: Draco Malfoy Character B: Severus Snape (Both for the previously mentioned reasons, I wish you could just filter out all slash)

That's what I generally go with, so I try to use recommendations on for good one shots or stories with Draco and Snape that aren't slash since I'll never see them otherwise.
