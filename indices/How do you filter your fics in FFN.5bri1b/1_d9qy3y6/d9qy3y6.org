Why don't you try DLP's fanfic Scryer?

It's a fanfiction search engine that allows you to search way more comprehensively than you can on the FFnet website itself. It's pretty magical, in all honesty, even if you're not usually a DLP user. It's right here: [[https://scryer.darklordpotter.net/]]

For me personally, I never read on FFnet, but if I am looking for something, I definitely don't search on the sites themselves. I'll search online, excluding pages on FFnet or Ao3 themselves, and I'll look for rec lists on certain topics I'm interested by using normal Google Fu.
