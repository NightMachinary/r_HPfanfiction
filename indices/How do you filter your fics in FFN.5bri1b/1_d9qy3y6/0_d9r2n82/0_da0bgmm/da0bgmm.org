That used to be how I found fics to read when I started out. I would read a story, then look at the author's favorites and bookmark any that seemed interesting. Then I would pick one to read and repeat that with their favorites. Unfortunately, after a short while I started looping around in circles or hit dead ends. I still have hundreds of bookmarks unfortunately.
