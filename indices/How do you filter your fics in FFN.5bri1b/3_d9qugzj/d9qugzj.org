I have given up on using filters to find anything worth reading. Every time I have tried going through top favorites, top reviews or recent or selecting specific characters, I just ended up sorting through a whole bunch of terrible writing with nothing good.

To find stories, I either search this subreddit for topics that I want to read about or go through recommended fanfiction lists. Another method that works for me is to go to authors of my favorite stories, and going through their favorites. I have found that people generally favorite similar stories to what they write about so looking through different authors favorites generally allows me to find good fics. Also looking through reviews and then looking through favorite lists of people who give good constructive criticism also works sometimes.
