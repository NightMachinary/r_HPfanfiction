Harry (/Dudley) would've grown up seeing wrestling in the 80's (beginning of the WWF, Hulk Hogan, first WrestleMania, nationalisation etc) so I could see this being interesting, especially since he's in his 4th year when the Attitude Era starts. Contrast the growing edginess of wrestling to how his future darkens etc.

But that would require a lot of wrestling history knowlege lol. And of course, British pro wrestling is totally different.
