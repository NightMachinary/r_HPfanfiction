Hermione? Not very. She's got an annoying personality - the fact that she has more knowledge than most of her peers makes here think she is smart, and thus right in every situation. It's not how it works, and it annoys the hell out of most people (i know, i used to do that, altough more for shit and giggles than to prove i'm right), especially with situations like in book 3 with that rabbit or scabbers supposedly being eaten. Or the house-elves.

Ron on the other hand should be fairly accepted - he's a chill bloke for the most part, well-versed in the culture so he can connect and talk with people over sports and somesuch - apart from year 5 and the whole 'is Voldemort really back' debacle noone would really have anything to hold against him.
