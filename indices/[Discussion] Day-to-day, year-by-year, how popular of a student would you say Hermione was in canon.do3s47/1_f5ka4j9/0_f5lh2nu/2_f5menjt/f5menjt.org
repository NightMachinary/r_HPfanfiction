No, it only shows that she likes books and values academia/grades in class! It doesn't make her smart! Fred and George are more creative and smart than Hermione, but they don't flaunt it and they don't care for grades at all! Hell, the Marauders have them beat, too (them together with Hermione would probably not hold a candle to James, Sirius, Remus and even Peter!)

I am not saying she is stupid (far from it), but reading ahead and knowing a lot of mindless trivia doesn't make you a genius or something like that!
