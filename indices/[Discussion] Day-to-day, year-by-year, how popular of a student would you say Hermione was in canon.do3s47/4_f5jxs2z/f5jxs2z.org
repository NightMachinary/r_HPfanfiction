The question is, popular with who? The teachers or the students?

For students, I think the Gryffindors like her but don't actually want to interact with her. They probably love the points she earns for the house cup. As for the rest of the school (-teachers), I think honestly it probably depends on how popular Harry is at the time, for example:

The Boy who lived is Lying? lets go harass his friends.

Hermione is Best friends with the Chosen One? She might know how to get in his heart.

I think there were tons of girls harassing her for tips and info on him, but she ran them off everytime.
