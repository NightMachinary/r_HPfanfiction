I'm thinking of the students. Malfoy was a bit of a dick, but he's not wrong in that the teachers favor her (the time turner). Edit: I didn't mean favoring to the extreme, but McGonagall decided to help her get a time turner for classes over people like Dumbledore or Riddle.

I do think she was mostly tolerated in the books, but there's a few moments when the Ravenclaws admire her. On the other hand, people aren't happy with her "know-it-all" attitude as seen in book 3.

I think she gained a bit of popularity as she got older, but it's still hard to say.
