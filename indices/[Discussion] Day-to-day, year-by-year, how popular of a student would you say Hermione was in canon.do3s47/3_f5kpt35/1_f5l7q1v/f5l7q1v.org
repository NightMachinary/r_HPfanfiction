I've done a stint as a TA and while I can agree it would be /annoying/ to suddenly have to grade an essay that's so much longer than everyone else's, that by itself wouldn't be a valid reason to dock points unless there was a stated maximum length that she exceeded. IIRC no such maximum is ever given for HP homework.
