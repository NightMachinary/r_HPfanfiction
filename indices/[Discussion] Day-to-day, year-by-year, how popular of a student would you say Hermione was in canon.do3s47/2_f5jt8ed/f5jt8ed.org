- Hermione: Unpopular, would be considered an insufferable know-it-all by most people outside of Gryffindor. Without Harry and Ron and the troll incident, she would have had no friends at all. She's socially awkward, doesn't understand or care about social cues when she wants to prove a point, and has no charisma. Would not vote Hermione as Minster for Magic.

    "Er," said Hermione, her voice slightly higher than usual out of nerves. "Well---er---hi."

    The group focused its attention on her instead, though eyes continued to dart back regularly to Harry.

    "Well... erm... well, you know why you're here. Erm... well, Harry here had the idea---I mean" (Harry had thrown her a sharp look) "I had the idea---that it might be good if people who wanted to study Defence Against the Dark Arts---and I mean, really study it, you know, not the rubbish that Umbridge is doing with us..."

.

Has no friends outside of Harry and Ron, for good reason.

    "I'll bet you wish you hadn't given up Divination now, don't you, Hermione?" asked Parvati.

    It was breakfast time, two days after the sacking of Professor Trelawney, and Parvati was curling her eyelashes around her wand and examining the effect in the back of her spoon. They were to have their first lesson with Firenze that morning.

    "Not really," said Hermione indifferently, who was reading the Daily Prophet. "I've never really liked horses."

    "He's not a horse, he's a centaur!" said Lavender, sounding shocked.

    "Either way, he's still got four legs," said Hermione coolly.

- Ron: Marginally popular. Has a reputation from a well-connected family; everyone knows the Weasleys from their "red hair and hand-me-down robes". Has the accomplishments of his older brothers, even if it makes Ron insecure about it. Earns popularity in his own right after joining the quidditch team and people start unironically singing the "Weasley is Our King" song.

    The song was growing louder, but it was issuing not from a crowd of green-and-silver-clad Slytherins, but from a mass of red and gold moving slowly towards the castle, bearing a solitary figure upon its many shoulders.

    "Weasley is our King,

    Weasley is our King,

    He didn't let the Quaffle in,

    Weasley is our King..."

    They beamed up at him as he passed. There was a scrum at the door of the castle and Ron's head got rather badly bumped on the lintel, but nobody seemed to want to put him down. Still singing, the crowd squeezed itself into the Entrance Hall and out of sight.
