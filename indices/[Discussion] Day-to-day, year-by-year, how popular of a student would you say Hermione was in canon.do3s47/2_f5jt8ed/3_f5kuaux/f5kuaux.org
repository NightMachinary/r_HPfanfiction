I would note that Hermione can be rather sharp with some social cues - much more so than Harry and Ron in interpreting /why/ people act the way they do or sore subjects. Examples that come to mind there include her knowing why Ron was jealous in book 4, and with Neville/the Unforgivables in the same book (being the one to prompt fake Moody to stop using /Crucio/ on the spider because of Neville, being the one to take the initiative to go talk to him afterwards while both Harry and Ron are completely confused). She's also much more perceptive of Cho's feelings in book 5 as another example.

That's not to say she'd be popular, but she's more socially apt than usually discussed. As for her reputation it probably depends on the year - after Dumbledore's Army I doubt she'd be considered by those other members as too much of a know-it-all, at least in the negative sense. In terms of friends, I think it's also not quite fair to use a single section of first year to generalize to say that without Ron/Harry she'd never have gotten any friends the whole time.

For Ron, I'd bump up from marginally popular to rather charismatic and able to fit into groups. Of the trio, he'd be the one that I'd see able to insert himself into any of the friends groups with no big issue - shown by how easily he slotted into Dean/Seamus' group in 4th year during his spat with Harry. Sure, he gets more popularity later on with Quidditch, but I'd see him as the most generally popular of the 3 in their grade.
