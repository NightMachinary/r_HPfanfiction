Very true. This is why I hate the "Badass Hermione" trope, because it's pure fanon and erases Hermione's character flaws within the trio's team dynamic. Hermione is a bookworm, Ron has the street smarts and social connections, and Harry is the action hero "saving people" guy of the trio. There's a reason why Hermione wanted Harry to teach DADA, instead of taking over the job herself.

During the battle in the muggle cafe in DH, Hermione was so nervous fighting Death Eaters that she accidentally cut open Ron's leg.

  Hermione crawled out from underneath the bench, shaking bits of glass ashtray out of her hair and trembling all over.

  "D---Diffindo," she said, pointing her wand at Ron, who roared in pain as she slashed open the knee of his jeans, leaving a deep cut. "Oh, I'm so sorry, Ron, my hand's shaking! Diffindo!"

JKR's writing is great because of the Trio's dynamic. They fight and struggle as friends, but they're always better off and stronger working together. So many fanfic authors don't get that, and make Badass Goddess Hermione into a character who doesn't need Ron or Harry to get the job done. And that kind of misses the point of the whole story.
