  I like to think of cursed child being canon with movie Hermione.

That makes sense, as Cursed Child Ron's characterization falls in line with Movie Ron's characterization. Namely, he's an incompetent idiot.

*ACT III, SCENE VI*

#+begin_quote
  *RON:* Snape, a royal visit, and --- (he sees SCORPIUS and is immediately alarmed) what's he doing here?

  *He fumbles out his wand.*

  *RON:* I'm armed and --- entirely dangerous and seriously advise you ---

  *He realizes his wand is the wrong way around and turns it right.*
