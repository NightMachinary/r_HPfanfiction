Harry and Ron are friends with Seamus and Dean from the beginning of Book 1, and Neville later on. Hermione never makes friends with the girls in her dorm, from Book 1 to 6.

Harry's first quidditch game:

  "Harry, you need your strength," said Seamus Finnigan. "Seekers are always the ones who get nobbled by the other team."

  "Thanks, Seamus," said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on his sausages.

  As a surprise for Harry, they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter for President and Dean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion underneath.

.

Meanwhile, Hermione's roomies gossip about her.

  "So?" said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. "She must've noticed she's got no friends."

  Hermione didn't turn up for the next class and wasn't seen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Hallowe'en feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls' toilets and wanted to be left alone.

And in Book 3 she acts like a dick about Lavender's baby rabbit dying.

  "Oh," said Hermione. She paused again. Then--- "Was Binky an old rabbit?"

  "N-no!" sobbed Lavender. "H-he was only a baby!"

  Parvati tightened her arm around Lavender's shoulders.

  "But then, why would you dread him dying?" said Hermione.

  Parvati glared at her.

  "Well, look at it logically," said Hermione, turning to the rest of the group. "I mean, Binky didn't even die today, did he, Lavender just got the news today---" Lavender wailed loudly "---and she can't have been dreading it, because it's come as a real shock---"

  "Don't mind Hermione, Lavender," said Ron loudly, "she doesn't think other people's pets matter very much."

If Hermione was in my house/dorm, I wouldn't want to be her friend either.
