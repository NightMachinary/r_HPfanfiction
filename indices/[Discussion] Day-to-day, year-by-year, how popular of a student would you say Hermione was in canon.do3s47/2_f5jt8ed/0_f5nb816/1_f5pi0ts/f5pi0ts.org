I think this is taken a bit out of context. Lavender is talking about how dreamy Firenze is and how that's a valid reason to regret not taking divination. I don't think it's unreasonable to not be swooning over a different species, and it still isn't a valid reason to take a course. It comes across as a bit racist because there isn't human level intelligence in any other species in the real world, so we just don't have an analog aside from race. Plus, I'm pretty sure Hermione is just making fun of her without vitriol towards Firenze.
