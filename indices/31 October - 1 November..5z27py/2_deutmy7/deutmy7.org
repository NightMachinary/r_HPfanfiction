  Where were Hagrid and Harry for that missing time?
#+end_quote

Hagrid is taking Harry from pub to pub, announcing what happened, for twenty hours, in order to promote Harry's brand. Which also explains why Dumbledore didn't use phoenix fire or Apparate with Harry.

#+begin_quote
  Hagrid meets Dumbledore at Dursley's late enough that everyone has gone to sleep (at least 10pm)
#+end_quote

The Dursleys had a young child, so 8:30pm is probably the earliest plausible time, if we're only talking about them being asleep and not the neighbors. (It would have been dark by 5pm, so that's not a significant constraint.)
