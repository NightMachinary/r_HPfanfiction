It isn't a plot hole, also Snape wasn't at Godrics Hallow, and Peter being there is only conjecture.

Voldemort shows up -> Booom -> Hagrid shows up -> McGonagall finds out from Hagrid where Harry is going -> McGonagall goes there -> Hagrid takes Harry to Private Drive.

So we don't know where Harry was, but we can conclude that Dumbledore checked Harry out during this time to make sure he was okay, and determined where he was going next. Since Hagrid knew to tell McGonagall.
