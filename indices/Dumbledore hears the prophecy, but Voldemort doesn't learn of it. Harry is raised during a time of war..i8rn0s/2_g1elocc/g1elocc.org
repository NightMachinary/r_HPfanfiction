Lily and James would probably have died anyways because the Death Eaters were targeting Order members one by one. Dumbledore would have taken Harry somewhere safe (probably the Dursleys again since Voldemort wouldn't have really cared much about Harry or the Muggle world at that point). Then he'd return to Hogwarts where Dumbledore would tell him what happened and would properly train him. He would not be worried about properly interacting with Harry because the Harry in this universe is not a Horcrux.

In my mind, the diary was indeed meant to return to Hogwarts through Draco in order to purge the school from Muggle-borns so the Chamber of Secrets would be reopened and Dumbledore would discover the existence of Horcruxes. In the next books we would probably see Harry and Dumbledore, aided maybe by Ron and Hermione tracking down Horcruxes and destroying them. Voldemort wouldn't really give a shit about Harry because he hasn't heard the prophecy so Harry could go about doing stuff.

Once Voldemort is mortal again, Harry would confront him. The risks would be higher since, as Voldemort no longer has Harry's mother's sacrifice in him, Voldemort could also easily kill Harry. Probably fueled by vengeance, Harry would win.
