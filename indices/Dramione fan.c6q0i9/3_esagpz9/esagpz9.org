Hey, welcome to the fandom. Draco/Hermione isn't really promoted/accepted here and I don't personally support it (Draco's too big of a bigot to me, and Malfoys are blood purists after all) but check out Colubrina's works on FF.net as she's a big Dramione writer. Her work is pretty well-written.

For more recommendations, check out [[/r/Dramione]]
