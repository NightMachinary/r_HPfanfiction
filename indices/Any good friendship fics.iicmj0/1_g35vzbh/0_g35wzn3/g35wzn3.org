Whoops I can't believe I forgot that. Harry couldn't bring himself to say goodbye right? I just watched a fan video and that scene from the movie was in it -I guess it was on my mind. I agree-I can't stand what the movies did to Ron and Ginny. They really did screw them over. I get so mad when I read fics the Weasleys are just so out of character and bashed for stupid reasons. Thanks so much for your recommendations! I can't wait to check them out!
