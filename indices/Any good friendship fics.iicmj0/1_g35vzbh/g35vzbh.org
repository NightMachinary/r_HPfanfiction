Ah, screw that movie scene in which Ron was shown as an emotionless idiot standing there. In the DH book, Harry never met them again, but instructed Neville to kill the snake and watched Ginny comforting an injured girl in the courtyard. The repeated bashing of Ginny and Ron in the movies is a major contributing factor to many fics discarding the Trio friendship and canon pairings.

If you want non canon pairings with strong Trio friendships, here are some really good ones:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/Contractual-Invalidation][Contractual Invalidation]], linkffn(11697407): Ron and Hermione don't appear much, but they are obviously Harry's closest confidants. Even Harry's ex Ginny gives some good advice about how to deal with Daphne.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12076771/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Girl-Who-Walked-on-Water][Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water]], linkffn(12076771): All of them are in a romantic relationship in this rare crossover.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), has no explicit pairings, but is implied that the Trio got together. Here, Harry and his friends had enough of the incorrigible establishment and began their own revolution...
