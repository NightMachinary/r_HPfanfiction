I don't know if it's the kind of thing you want, but there is a chance that it is so I direct you towards “Island of Fire” (linkao3(3236603)).

Outside of that, I remember something maybe like that happening in Darth Marrs's “Revenge of the Wizard”, but I have to admit that it felt too “and then they did stuff and were awesome all around” when they begun making their base and so I just stopped reading; as such, I have no idea if the element you are looking for actually is there to the degree you want it.
