Rituals.

Grab a few items/ingredients, throw in some symbolism, and you have a ritual.

Vulture eyes, raven's claw, animal skull, elder branch, and two knuts.

Vultures and Ravens are often referenced with death. Skulls are symbols of death. The knuts are for the ferryman. The branch? representation of Death from the deathly hallows.

Something something "The Vulture has found a coward" place the eyes on the horcrux, the eyes rotate to "look" at the horcrux. something something "raven brings forth the agent's tool". Place the claw on the branch (it melts into it). "All are equal when Death comes knocking". Knock on the horcrux with the branch, ghost claws comes out and grabs the soul piece in the horcrux. "death always wins" tap the stick onto the animal skull. The claws insert the soul shard into the skull. Place the coins on the eyes and stomp on the skull. The skull and coins disappear. ( I low-effort pulled this out of my arse in like two minutes.)

The scarcrux is the easiest of all. It's more of a leech than anything, as Voldemort didn't add any of the protections or rituals to it to cement the horcrux status. It could be removed relatively effortlessly.
