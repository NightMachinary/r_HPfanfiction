There's probably no way to do this while remaining canon compliant:

  ‘Our problem is that there are very few substances as destructive as Basilisk venom, and they're all dangerous to carry around with you. That's a problem we're going to have to solve, though, because ripping, smashing or crushing a Horcrux won't do the trick. You've got to put it beyond magical repair.'

  But my point is that whatever happens to your body, your soul will survive, untouched,' said Hermione. ‘But it's the other way round with a Horcrux. The fragment of soul inside it depends on its container, its enchanted body, for survival. It can't exist without it.'

  ‘And once the diary was properly destroyed, the bit of soul trapped in it could no longer exist. Ginny tried to get rid of the diary before you did, flushing it away, but, obviously, it came back good as new.'

The curses and enchantments on the horcrux safeguard it from destruction. The container has to be destroyed for this to work.

One theory that's prevalent is that horcruxes can be destroyed with a killing curse. Ultimately, the reasoning behind suffers from the fact that Harry is not a horcrux and has not been protected through magic and neglects to explain contradictory information as provided above.

  So, because Voldemort never went through the grotesque process that I imagined creates a Horcrux, with Harry, it was just that he had destabilized his soul so much that it split when he was hit by the back-firing curse. And so this part of it flies off and attaches to the only living thing in the room. A part of it flees in the very close-to-death limbo state that Voldemort then goes on and exists in. *I suppose it's very close to being a Horcrux. But Harry was not-- did not become an evil object. He wasn't-- he didn't have curses upon him that the other Horcruxes had. He himself was not contaminated by carrying this bit of parasitic soul.*

The only way for the vessels to remain intact is for the creator to wish it:

#+begin_quote
  ‘Isn't there any way of putting yourself back together?' Ron asked. ‘Yes,' said Hermione, with a hollow smile, ‘but it would be excruciatingly painful.' ‘Why? How do you do it?' asked Harry. ‘Remorse,' said Hermione. ‘You've got to really feel what you've done. There's a footnote. Apparently the pain of it can destroy you. I can't see Voldemort attempting it, somehow, can you?'
#+end_quote

Of course, this is very unlikely in a world with a canon Voldemort personality/character. Thus, my advice is to change something about the rules to make it possible. It's fanfiction!
