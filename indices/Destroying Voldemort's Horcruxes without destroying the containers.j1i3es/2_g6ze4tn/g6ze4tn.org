Canon-wise? no method is elaborated, the Horcrux is a curse that lodges permanently a piece of a perverted soul into the afflicted item/being, therefore utter destruction is the only way. Thus, I believe you should develope further your own take into how Magic works in your universe, I for instance believe that China and Africa have a completely diferent way of casting magic, therefore using a complex ritual there might be a way to sever the link those soulshards have to their containers.
