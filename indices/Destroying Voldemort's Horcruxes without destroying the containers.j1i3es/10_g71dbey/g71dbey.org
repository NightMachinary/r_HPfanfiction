Canonically there's no known way.

In fics I've seen dripping some vampire blood onto the item, destroys the soul and the item is intact.

One had the idea that if a horcrux is a perversion dark magic to gain immortality, maybe a Light magic could counter it - a philosopher's stone. Maybe soak the horcrux in elixir of life, or somehow sacrifice the stone to remove the horcrux.

Chuck the horcrux into the Love Room at the Department of Mysteries. THe horcrux wont survive pure love!

Tossing an Avada Kedava at the horcrux is always popular (it worked with Harry).

And the old standby, call the goblins. They'll either remove the horcrux or transfer it to something you don't mind destroying. For a fee of course.
