If one is following canon, there isn't a known way.

However. It makes sense that if one can put something INTO an object, one can take it out.

It's just not something that Rowling wanted to think about. I'd personally think if anyone knew about such things, the Egyptians or Sumerians would, as they have myths about such things, and magic is based on myths.

As others said, some sort of ritual spell should be doable. Probably dangerous for HARRY as he's got two souls in him, though.
