I've detailed elsewhere why severing a soul via the killing curse would not work in the case of a horcrux, which, by nature, differs from a body in terms of concept and functionality.

The idea of the killing curse destroying a horcrux by destroying the object is an interesting one. However, I think this idea contradicts canon as well.

  But the headless golden statue of the wizard in the fountain had sprung alive, leaping from its plinth, and landed on the floor with a crash between Harry and Voldemort. The [killing curse] merely glanced off its chest as the statue flung out its arms, protecting Harry.

  The statue of the witch ran at Bellatrix, who screamed and sent spells streaming uselessly off its chest, before it dived at her, pinning her to the floor. Meanwhile, the goblin and the house-elf scuttled toward the fireplaces set along the wall, and the one-armed centaur galloped at Voldemort, who vanished and reappeared beside the pool. The headless statue thrust Harry backward, away from the fight, as Dumbledore advanced on Voldemort and the golden centaur cantered around them both.

  Another jet of green light flew from behind the silver shield. This time it was the one-armed centaur, galloping in front of Dumbledore, that took the blast and shattered into a hundred pieces, but before the fragments had even hit the floor,

From this, we see that Dumbledore protected the statues with enchantments. The potent power of the killing curse means that it is capable of overcoming the enchantments occasionally.

  ‘Yes,' said Hermione, now turning the fragile pages as if examining rotting entrails, ‘because it warns Dark wizards how strong they have to make the enchantments on them. From all that I've read, what Harry did to Riddle's diary was one of the few really foolproof ways of destroying a Horcrux.'

  the receptacle is prepared by dark magic to become the receptacle of a fragmented piece of soul and that that piece of soul deliberately detached from the Master Soul to act as a future safeguard or anchor to life and to safeguard against death.

It's pretty clear that enchantments on a horcrux are on another level compared to other objects. The killing curse is already not enough to consistently destroy objects protected by quick enchantments (nor does it even consistently damage objects). Along with the fact that it's never mentioned as a plausible method for destroying inanimate objects and horcruxes, I don't think that this would work.

In short, I think this method fails because the enchantments would protect against the physical harm caused by a killing curse and we know the conceptual harm (of death) doesn't work on horcruxes.
