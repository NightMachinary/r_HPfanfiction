Well according to what's given in canon, the only way to destroy a Horcrux is to damage its container beyond means of magical repair. And even in the Avada Kedavra's case, there's no magic of bringing back the dead and a dead body will rot and eventually turn to dust in time. Now it's up to you to explore whether Avada Kedavra would work on inanimate objects the same way it works on living beings without the rotting in time.

Edit: actually in OOTP during the duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort, it's mentioned the killing curse would explode or set inanimate objects on fire. But you could go with the whole concept of severing the soul from the body without physical damage in the case of Horcruxes.
