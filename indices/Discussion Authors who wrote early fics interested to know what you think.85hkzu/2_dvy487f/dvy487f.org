Before the Horcrux thing came out, I remember writing a story where a female OC gets saved by a mysterious middle aged wizard from something. She finds out that it's Harry and we find out that he disappeared from the Wizarding world after his final battle with Voldemort. Harry had to trap Voldemort inside himself and isolate himself from the rest of the world.

That was probably 13-14 years ago. I never got around to type and post it on FFNet. The handwritten text might still be lying around somewhere. It's funny though that even back then, the idea of Voldemort being trapped inside Harry had been floating around.

I also recall a fanfic I eventually deleted from FFNet about this OC who was the adopted daughter of the Flamels and a contemporary of the Marauders. I don't remember what the point of that story was anymore (no more notes) but it did feature Snape and Lily being friends. This fic was written approximately 15-16 years ago, way before Deathly Hallows came out.
