I first started writing HP fanfic between OOTP and HBP. There were so many interesting ideas floating around at the time. Seer Ron and Dumbledore being a time-traveling Ron being a couple that I remember. Harry/Hermione was in full force, but I was firmly in the Harry/Ginny camp. Harry being an Auror wasn't concrete yet and there was nothing about Ginny going pro Quidditch. Ginny becoming a healer was pretty popular at the time which is what I ended up going with. I remember reading HBP hoping that my little Potterverse would survive. All in all, it didn't do too badly!

It was definitely a fun and exciting time and I'm glad I was able to participate in it.
