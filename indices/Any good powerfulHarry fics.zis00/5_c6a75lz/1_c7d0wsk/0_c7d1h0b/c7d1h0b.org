I guess tactful might not have been the best word choice.

To me, the HP/DM seemed as if it belonged; I hate reading extremely contrived HP/DM. It wasn't garish or fake, and I think it was tactful in that sense.

It was rather explicit though, so tactful in that sense? No. But (I thought) it was rather well done, so I accepted it.
