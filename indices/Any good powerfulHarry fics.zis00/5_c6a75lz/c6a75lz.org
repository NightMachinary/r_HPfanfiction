You may have read it, but try The Sacrifices Arc by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][Lightning on the Wave]].

It ships HP/DM, but it's tactfully done and doesn't come in fully until about the 5th book. It's whiny at times, but definitely powerful!Harry in a very different, unique way. The story is really well done; read it for no other reason than the beautiful, wonderful interpretation this author has of pureblood rituals/dances. Easily my favorite part of this 7 story epic.
