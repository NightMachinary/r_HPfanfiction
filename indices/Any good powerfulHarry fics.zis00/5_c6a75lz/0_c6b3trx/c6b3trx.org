It is pretty good, but I feel like it used the same thing over and over again: "Oh noes, Harry is locking his emotions away, oh noes! Stop him!" I get that it would be tempting and all, and that it would be really bad if they burst out, but the pools Snape taught him didn't seem that different from the box to me. Otherwise, the HP/DM is basically pointless but doesn't really detract, and it's too long (averages at 900 pages per book on my Nook).
