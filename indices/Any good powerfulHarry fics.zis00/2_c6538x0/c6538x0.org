  PART I: Days before his 6th year, Harry Potter is sucked into another universe by forces not of this world. Dazed and confused, Harry finds himself in a world where his parents are alive, where Voldemort has never fallen and he is Voldemort's key enforcer.

Harry is transported into another evil!Harry, which explains how he suddenly becomes much stronger. It's one of my favorite HP fics. Downside is that it was supposed to be a trilogy and it was abandoned during the second part, but the first part is finished and it can be read on it's own.
