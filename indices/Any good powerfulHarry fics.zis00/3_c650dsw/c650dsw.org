I don't know if I'm right with this powerful!Harry stuff but [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=5036][A Year Like None Other]] is an amazing fic (I will warn you though, it's about the length of an actual novel and has mature language and violence). It was written before the Half-Blood Prince was published so technically it's now an AU fic. But I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. Without trying to spoil it too much, something happens to Harry to make his magic incredibly unstable and more powerful. Disregard this comment if you've already read it!
