might try linkffn(Harry Tano) in another fandom linkffn(Jedi Harris) is one of my favorite stories.. Xander Harris of Buffy puts on Obi-Wan's costume for Halloween, Ethan Ryane calls the chaos god who make everyone in Sunnydale actually be who they are costumed as for a few hours, Obi-Wan's knowledge stays with Xander. I like the story a lot, ymmv.
