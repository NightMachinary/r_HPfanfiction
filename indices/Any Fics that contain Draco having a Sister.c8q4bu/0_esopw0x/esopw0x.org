[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9738656/1/You-ll-Be-The-Death-of-Me]] is the best example I can think of. Neville/Graces Malfoy is the pairing and is my personal favourite romance in the fandom. Canon events are up until 6th year, which is where the story begins. Their romance is the primary focus, but the unwilling servitude of the Malfoys to the dark lord is a sizeable arc that is handled rather well. LV is quite honestly freaking scary, so much so that I prefer this LV to practically any other I've read. Give it a try.
