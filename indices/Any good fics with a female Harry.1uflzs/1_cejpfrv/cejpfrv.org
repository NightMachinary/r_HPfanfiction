These two are the only straight up fem-harry fics I'm in the habit of reccing these days.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6008512/1/A_Butterfly_Effect][A Butterfly Effect]] by Slygoddess*

This one gets a bit bogged down in melodrama, but the story, writing, and characters are unparalleled. If you like or can tolerate femslash, this fic is for you. There's something in this one for everyone really. /Hard R/

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8299839/1/Alexandra-Potter][Alexandra Potter]] by Taure*

If you like Taure's theories about magical theory, you'll like this fic. He's a decent writer, and even though this has a bit of throwaway plot, it's very readable. /R for saftey/
