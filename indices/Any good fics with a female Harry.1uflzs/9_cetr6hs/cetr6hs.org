[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/1/Princess-of-the-Blacks][Princess of the Blacks]] is definitely worth the read, i'd rate it second only to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6008512/1/A_Butterfly_Effect][A Butterfly Effect]] which has already been mentioned, it's a bit dark and the eventual paring is femslash if that bothers you.
