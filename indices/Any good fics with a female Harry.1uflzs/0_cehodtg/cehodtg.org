Man, I am with you. I really like fem!Harry, or gender!swap in general (have you read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8202739/1/Weasley-Girl][Weasley Girl]]...?), but so often stories that employ those tropes are pure crap. Here are a couple I've enjoyed, though.

The following two are both WIP's that I bookmarked, but I don't remember a lot about them other than the fact that they're both girl!Harry and both are decent enough that I decided I wanted to keep reading them if/when they're updated.

This one is also a WIP, but I remember more about it. I really like this one, I think that the author characterizes Harriet and Snape really well. But it is an eventual Snarry, and I know that the age difference thing squicks some people. Nothing happens while she's in school, though. Nearly 400,000 words have been written and they are no closer to being in a romantic relationship than they were at the beginning.

And finally, this one is a bit different. It's not fem!Harry /per se/. I'm not sure how to explain it other than the fact that it is very, very AU. Also it's eventual HP/LV. But HP stands for Haesel Potter, and hardly anything is the same as it is in canon. It's very well-written, for what it's worth.
