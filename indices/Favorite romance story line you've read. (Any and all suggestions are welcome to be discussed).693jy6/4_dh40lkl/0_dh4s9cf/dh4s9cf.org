Well done romance transcends pairing preferences. I never dreamed I would like a Harry/Muggle pairing, and then I read Grow Young With Me. I also HATE that Ginny was paired with Harry in Cannon so also dont like it in Fan Fiction, and yet do come across the occasional story I enjoy because their pairing is just so well written and often feels less forced than it did in cannon.
