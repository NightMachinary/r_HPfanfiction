  What makes this one so much better than the others?

Yeah, I'm kind of curious about that, too. Because, as a Snarry fan, I'm inevitably going to disagree. I skimmed the first couple of chapters, and the fic is fine but probably not a desert-island keeper for me. It's first-person POV, and the voice doesn't strike me as Snape's. That's always an issue when writing in first person, I think. Harry doesn't seem very Harryish, either, although YMMV.

It does seem fairly plotty. Maybe that's why? Romance fics as a genre seldom pack a lot of plot, so it can be especially satisfying when a good romance has more than just the love story going for it.

My answer to your question would be linkao3(3836032) (which I don't claim to be the only good Snarry). Like "A History of Magic," it has a time-travel aspect, but except for the Epilogue, it doesn't actually change canon events.

People always say that humor is subjective, and I think romance is, too; what one reader swoons over will often leave another reader cold.

And on the question of what I see in Snarry - well, it's not always romance. This is a ship with very interesting dynamics (understatement), and it's inspired some wonderful stories, but it takes an extremely talented author to write a convincing romance around them.
