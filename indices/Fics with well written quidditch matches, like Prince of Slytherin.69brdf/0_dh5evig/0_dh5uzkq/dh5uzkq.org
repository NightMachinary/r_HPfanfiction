The quidditch in VP is more about the 'off the pitch' obligations of the players and what is entailed with being a professional athlete. In QWC the quidditch is mostly just used as a framing device for the rest of the story.

Of my stories, Letters probably has the 'best' written quidditch matches from an actual gameplay standpoint.
