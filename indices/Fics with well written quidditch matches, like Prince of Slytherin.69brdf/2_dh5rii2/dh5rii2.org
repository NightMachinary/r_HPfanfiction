linkffn(Rise from dust) has some interesting quidditch matches. (Depending on your tastes you might not really tolerate the first one or two chapters, but I'd suggest powering through them if that is the case.)

linkffn(Travel Secrets: First) and its sequels do as well, though quidditch is not the focus of the story.
