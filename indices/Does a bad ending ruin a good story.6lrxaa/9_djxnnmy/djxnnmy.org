Yes, even with Original Fiction. I'll use my favourite series of books as an example, The Magicians.

The main character grows from the first book, he matures, and he becomes a much better Magic-User for it, we start really getting into the meat and potatoes of Magic with interesting spells and revelations I didn't see coming. Then, suddenly, it all goes to shit in Book 3. From the rushed ending to the completely regressive nature of the main character who was a thirty year old at that point. Then Magic lost the 'turtles all the way down' feel in favour of cheap plot devices. It's the perfect example of never shooting a Chekov's Gun too late.

Fanfiction does this quite a bit as well, but it's not something I really don't expect. Forging The Sword was obviously going nowhere, even before the hiatus, the author wrote and wrote and kept trying to go down the rabbit hole, and when he looked around himself by chapter 12, he realised that he had nowhere to move, he had written himself into an odd hole that wouldn't have lasted more than one more chapter or two.

I definitely remember Unsung Hero when I read it, and that left an extremely bad taste in my mouth. Simply because it left a lot of inconsistency and contradiction in its wake. If we ever got the inkling that such an ending was possible, we would not have been as surprised or revolted as we were, but, nope, completely unrealistic moves turned into a shit fest.

Then there was Prisoner's Cipher with the same trope of "Harry reaches his goal but the ending is ambiguous to whether he lives or dies". Otherwise, it was an insanely good fic that could have had a much greater premise and maybe even potential for a sequel.
