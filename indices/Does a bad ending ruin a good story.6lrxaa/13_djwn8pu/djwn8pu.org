Hell no it doesn't. If a bad ending ruined an otherwise great story I would fucking hate the Harry Potter series.

There's no way I can discount a story with 90%+ of amazing content because of some plot decision I didn't agree with towards the end.

I can both recognize that the ending was shite and that the rest of a story was really amazing and still have appreciation for the 90% I loved.

Bunch of salty mother fuckers in this thread.
