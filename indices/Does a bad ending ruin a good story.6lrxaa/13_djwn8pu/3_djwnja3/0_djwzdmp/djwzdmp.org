I agree. People always look at me funny when i tell them that Mass Effect 3 was my favorite of the trilogy. I can understand the hate for the ending, i disliked it myself but that doesn't change the fact that i just played a 40 hour game and loved every minute of it except for the last 30.

It's much of the same with fanfiction. Most of it isn't finished anyways and i'm usually detached enough to not care if an amateur author botches an ending. I can just go with my head canon instead and still like the rest of the story.
