A let down every once and then is healthy. Puts it into perspective how good something is that it can so easily be made to displease. You have to learn to reconcile the bad with the good just like any relationship. While I certainly blame JK Rowling for her shitty (IMO) decisions for DH (and to some extent HBP), it makes me love the rest of the series so much more for what she accomplished.

The bad taste in your mouth just allows you to contrast it with how refreshing and beautiful the first sip was.
