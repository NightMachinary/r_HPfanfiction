I don't think the canon ending is shite. I don't like it (I don't like most of book 6 and 7), but after reading lots of fanfiction there's a lot worse that JKR could have done: Just imagine if one of those shitty Gary Stu stories were canon and Harry fought Voldemort while riding into battle on the back of a Basilisk while his miraculously revived parents distract the death eaters.
