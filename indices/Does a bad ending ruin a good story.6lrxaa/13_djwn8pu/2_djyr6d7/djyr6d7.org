  If a bad ending ruined an otherwise great story I would fucking hate the Harry Potter series.

Hmm, how would ruining something automatically equate to hating it? Listen, I'll be honest, I think Rowling is an incredibly terrible writer when it comes to making characters, and all of her plot points feel contrived and generally forced down your throat. It's not Harry that gets himself into anything, it's the other way around, trouble finds him. It all felt inconsequential, there was no worry, there was no real danger. But the world she built was interesting and it made an interesting point on the Magic Genre, it wasn't unique, it wasn't even the first of its time, but it was something that meshed a lot of tropes together into one world and made it all work. For that, I give it credit. But I will never allow a good world to put a wall over my eyes for bad characters.

  There's no way I can discount a story with 90%+ of amazing content because of some plot decision I didn't agree with towards the end.
#+end_quote

Not that one exists, nor that someone is saying to discount it all. That's typically why people say, "Yea, this story did this amazing, it had really good this and that BUT the ending was god awful, why would Harry do that?"

It's a thread promoting being salty, you're calling the kettle black.
