  Hmm, how would ruining something automatically equate to hating it?
#+end_quote

I'm just saying for myself, I hated the ending of the HP series, so if I let my feelings about the ending inform my feelings about the entire series, *I* would hate the series.

  incredibly terrible writer when it comes to making characters

I'd have to disagree with you there. She wrote characters that millions of people identified with really well.

  Not that one exists, nor that someone is saying to discount it all.

Maybe I have a different definition of "ruined," but to me, a bad ending ruining an otherwise good story means you don't like the story as a whole because the ending was bad.

In a similar way, if somebody thought a story was ruined because an author uses single quotes for dialogue (As in common in some place) instead of double quotes, that would mean they dislike a story because the author used single quotes.

My position is that the ending of HP was bad, but I liked the story as a whole. So yes, I agree that you can acknowledge the good and bad aspects of a fic and still either like or dislike it. To the OP's prompt, the ending of a story is one aspect that can be done poorly and not automatically make me dislike a piece.

  It's a thread promoting being salty, you're calling the kettle black.

I'm not sure the second part of your comment follows from the first, but my statement was meant to comment on that fact that nobody else in the thread defended the negative position. That surprised me.
