I'm not sure the Bible is a good comparison with child/teen fiction. Children/teens don't read novels for the outstanding literary expertise. They read them because they can draw comparisons between characters and situations within a book and in their own lives. Familiar situations, fictional and fantastic world. In that, Rowling certainly succeeded.
