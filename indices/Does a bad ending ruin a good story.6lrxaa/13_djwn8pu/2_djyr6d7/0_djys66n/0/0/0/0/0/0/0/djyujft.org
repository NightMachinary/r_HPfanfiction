  Overcoming adversity

That is the most general way of saying someone can relate to something. Once again, you could easily force the parallels on your own and say they exist. Adversity is extremely subjective to the person.

  Are you really trying to tell me that the average kid would rather read Shakespeare than Harry Potter? Give me a break.

Why not? According to your definition of what makes a book a best-seller, it's relation to the reader, what's more relatable than loving someone and them not reciprocating/you not being capable of being together due to constraints. According to you, that's what makes a good story.

Once more, relation doesn't make good characters. If you're a vain person and you try to find similarities in other vain people does that automatically make the character good? I don't understand the rationale.
