  That is the most general way of saying someone can relate to something. Once again, you could easily force the parallels on your own and say they exist. Adversity is extremely subjective to the person.

If you want me to get more specific:

Draco - Class Bully

Crabbe/Goyle - Bully's lackies

Binns - Boring teacher

Snape - Mean teacher

The list can go on and on. These are exaggerations of familiar people in people's lives. That's one of the most attractive parts about fiction. A fictional story can exaggerate familiar situations so that the emotional impact is enhanced. Obviously the more outrageous the scenario the more generic the familiar association, but it's always there.

Please, it's not like I was asked to provide a formal definition. I made a general statement, don't play dumb.

Relatability was one example of character creation that Rowling did well, and in fact I think it was one of the things she did best. I can list a couple other things.

Another area of character writing that Rowling did well was giving each character their own voice. Another aspect is that the main protagonists were multidimensional with positive and negative personality traits that are, for the most part, believable within the context of her fictional world.

These are just 3 things I think Rowling did well. I don't like the direction she went with some of her characters as the plot developed, but that doesn't mean it was done poorly.

Certainly she isn't perfect. The villains in the series tend to be pretty one dimensional without many (if any) redeeming qualities until very late into the series.

I just don't think "incredibly terrible" is an accurate description of her character creation.
