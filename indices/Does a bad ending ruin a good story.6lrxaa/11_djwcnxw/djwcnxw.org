Does Wind Sheer really have a bad ending? Bad in comparison to what? If you compare it to the rest of the fic, then it's par for the course. You know how sometimes a story starts off good, and then goes down hill? Like, you can say that about Delende Est, as there are some definitive points where that happens. Wind Sheer just started at the bottom of that hill and made no attempt to climb it. It's a bad fic that has a bad ending, and it doesn't surprise me.
