For me, it's all about climax/resolution of the story. If the story had a few climaxes then the final bad climax doesn't ruin the whole story. For example, I don't really like the last two books and especially the epilogue of Harry Potter series. But because other books were good and had their own relative endings that I enjoyed, I can't say it ruined the all 7 books. It makes me feel somewhat disappointed but when I'm reminiscing the story, I still remember those good climaxes.

But if the fic had one single climax at it's end and it was bad, then yes. Even if the writing was good, even if first few chaapters, descent, conflict and/or road to climax was good, if the climax was bad, it ruins the story for me.

 

For example, Mass Effect series had many many different sub stories with their own endings in it and even though ending of Mass Effect 3 was really bad, I still can't say it ruined the whole trilogy. It didn't even ruined the third game because there were many sub stories like genophage, quarian/geth conflict etc and they had their own endings. I still say Mass Effect 3 was good.
