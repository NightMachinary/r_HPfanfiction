To each their own, although it does likely depend on how close to the ending the story was abandoned. Its way easier to do a head-cannon type of ending if the story was mostly finished. But most abandoned fics are abandoned somewhere between the first few chapters and about 60% complete max. That's a lot to complete in your head.
