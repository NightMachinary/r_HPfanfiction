Yes!

I read /the Pureblood Princess/ (linkffn(The Pureblood Princess)) and loved it. The character seemed realistic and the cast in character. I loved the take on magic lessons, and the relationship was compelling. It felt like real teenagers with real emotions. There was sex, but it wasn't the focus of the fic. There was plot, too, although it wasn't huge. I couldn't stop reading! I finished the whole thing in under a week.

The ending broke all that. It made no sense... It demonized at least one character badly... It made Harry act out of character... And it completely changed the genre of the story with the barest of explanations. The whole thing made the story go from one of my absolute favorites to a bad memory. :(

EDIT: (Attempted to) put in a link for the story.
