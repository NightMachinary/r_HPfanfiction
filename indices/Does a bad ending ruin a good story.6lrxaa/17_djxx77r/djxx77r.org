In general yes, but I'd like to qualify that statement a bit:

It can be tolerated if the bad ending doesn't undermine/expose the rest of the story. Usually though the bad ending shows that what we considered to be good before wasn't really good and just accidental or - worse - just grandstanding without any planned outcome/resolution. These are the worst of the bad endings, when the reader just goes "Oh... guess all of that stuff that I thought was there was just in my own head".
