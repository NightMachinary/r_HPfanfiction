It depends, for me. While it isn't FanFiction, what abruptly comes to mind is Stephen King's "Under the Dome." Unique premise, an awful, horrible, non-sensical ending. However, it remains my third favorite book of his (behind "The Stand" and "It") mainly because of the story itself and its characters. The developmental process he put each one through was immersive and by the end, I actually didn't want the story to end.

So, if an author can make the reader really care about his/her characterizations (as many characters are not their own creations but usage of the ones JK Rowling cooked up, save for OC's), then a bad ending could put a damper on the story itself, while not having an overall impact on how one views the story from the beginning to the end. Of course, though, everyone is entitled to his/her own opinion.
