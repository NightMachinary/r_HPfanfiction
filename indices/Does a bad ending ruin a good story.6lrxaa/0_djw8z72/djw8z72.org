Yes, without a bloody doubt.

The greatest example of this for me would be Unspeakable Things by Darth Marrs. Its a fun fic with a unique premise and decent character development all round which in the final chapter, throws out an entire fic worth of character development for one of the characters just to make a not at all funny penis size joke. It comes right out of left field, isn't funny and to this day that fic remains possibly the only one that I remember for how much it genuinely pissed me off.

A bad ending can ruin anything though. Just look at How I Met Your Mother.
