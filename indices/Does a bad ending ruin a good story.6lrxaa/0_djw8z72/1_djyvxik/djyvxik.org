Indeed, look at original works like "Lost" (shame on you J.J. Abrams, people should have realized that you are an overrated director back then!) and "Battlestar Galactica" (the new version...damned: "God is real, god did it!" is such a shitty cop-out that I want to scream and whack those directors with something...how they could think that this was a satisfactory or even decent (or dare I say it: Good!) a ending is really beyond me and it's not because I am an Atheist, I know believers who agree with me!)...or if you are into games: Mass Effect 3 (damned, that game is weakest part of the trillogy, no bombastic ending (or endings, after all the games made player choices important - but ME3 shits all over that!), too on rails (this is supposed to be an RPG, but they don't let you deviate from the core mission-schedule (no, you can decide to do additional missions, but that's it!), unlike say Dragon Age: Origins where you could decide who to recruit first (yes doing it a certain way made more sense, but over all? You could do it your way and it didn't hurt the story at all!)...no ME3 is so on rails that you don't have any freedom at all!) etc.)...hell, it happens in books, too like say in the "Hunger Games" books (damned, the tough girl who needs no man ends up with the boring asshole and becomes a fucking housewife...same for the "Black Magicians" books by Trudi Canavan (if I remember this right), where Sonea the badass girl ends up pregnant and under town-arrest (she can't leave the city!) oh and her lover the badass mage-leader dies, well just because...I noticed that this seems a pattern with female writers (maybe girls like this kind of thing, but I am not a girl, so I wouldn't know!) and it fucking pisses me off how they can screw over their female heroes like that (it's like they brainwash them to fit some kind of stupid and boring narrative!)

So my answer would be: Yes, of course it does! I'd rather have WIP-Story (or a story that someone else finishes!) than a weak contrived and cobbled together ending that either makes no sense or is otherwise dissapointing (for example: Changing the main character (Harry) into a researcher and in the end he still becomes an auror (instead of sticking to the passion the writer gave him!) flunky for the ministry and marries Ginny (instead of going after another girl and/or not marrying at all!))
