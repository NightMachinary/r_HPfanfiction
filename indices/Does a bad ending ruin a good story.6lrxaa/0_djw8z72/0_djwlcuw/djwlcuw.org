There's another fic, I can't remember what it was called with a bad ending that completely ruined the story for me.

It was a WBWL fic, with James, Lily and the brother being extremely hateable. Harry went through trials and stuff to destroy Voldemort's horcruxes, with an interesting theme of 'one being ends up sacrificed per horcrux destroyed'. The brother is not just useless, but inadvertently actively sabotaging the horcrux hunt when he gives the Locket to Hermione so that she would start seeing him instead of Harry (as she is his only friend due to everyone being poisoned against him by his family).

So after a somewhat decent adventure of finding and destroying the horcruxes, becoming a basilisk animagus in a non-shit and non-useless manner, Voldemort is destroyed, and everyone realises that Harry was the true BWL all along and that he just fixed all their shit.

And then the shit ending happens that completely ruins the fic.

It starts by explaining away Harry's neglect by his family as the horcrux in his scar causing them to view him negatively. Okay, so you just gave an excuse for parents to be utter shits to their child. It would still have been semi-decent if that was where it ended. But no, in the final scene, Harry's brother (and for the life of me I can't remember what he's called - nor do I care) straight up fucking /murders/ him out of jealousy. Then there's a scene where Harry gets to go back and redo it all but with only half his memories or some such shit, obviously setting up for a nonexistent sequel.

The entire fic was ruined for me b y that ending. A character designed to be as repulsive, disgusting and hateable as possible, who you want to see get his just desserts at the end, fucking /wins/. We don't see any repercussions for him. We don't see any punishment, absolutely nothing against him for his disgusting and sometimes date-rapey actions. Harry gets to start all over again for the most bullshit reason possible. That fic went from 'fairly decent and enjoyable, something I'll reread at some point' straight to my shitlist of 'never touching that stupid fucking fic again'.
