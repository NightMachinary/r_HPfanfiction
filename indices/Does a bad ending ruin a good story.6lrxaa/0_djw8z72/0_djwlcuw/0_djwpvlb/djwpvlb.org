What's even worse is that the author is completely unrepentant about the terrible ending they wrote. Basically they try to wiggle any criticism of the ending into "well that's what I was trying to go for." No, you wrote a decent story and then gave your readers an abomination of an ending. What's worse was that it was intentionally crafted for a sequel story that just had a ridiculous plot. The fact that the convoluted sequel was abandoned came as no surprise.

I'm okay with a bad ending, if an author looks back on it by going, "yeah I screwed up." While I will wish a story had ended better, that at least leaves me with less of a bad taste in my mouth. It's when authors are completely unrepentant about the terrible ending to their story that readers revolt against (a great real life example is /How I Met Your Mother/) that I feel a good story is well, and truly ruined.
