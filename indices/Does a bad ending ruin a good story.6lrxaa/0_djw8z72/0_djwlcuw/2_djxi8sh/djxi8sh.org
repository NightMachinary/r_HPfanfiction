  The entire fic was ruined for me b y that ending. A character designed to be as repulsive, disgusting and hateable as possible, who you want to see get his just desserts at the end, fucking wins.

A bad guys win fic could be done well. A lot of real fiction is based on this (Brave New World, 1984, and the Great Gatsby come to mind).

That said, the author is usually trying ti make some philosphical point or has been hintinf towards it thr whole time. Out of the blue endings never (edit: rarely) work.
