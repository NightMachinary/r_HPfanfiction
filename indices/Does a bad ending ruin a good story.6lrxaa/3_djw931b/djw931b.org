Absolutely. A bad ending can totally ruin an otherwise good story. That's not just the case with fanfics, but even with published stories. It's happened lots of times with me; I've read a story that I've really enjoyed and then I get to the ending and it all falls apart, and afterwards I can't enjoy the story anymore.

If it's a multi-part series, say a trilogy, and it's only the last book in the series that has a bad ending, then I might still love the first two books and just hate the third one.
