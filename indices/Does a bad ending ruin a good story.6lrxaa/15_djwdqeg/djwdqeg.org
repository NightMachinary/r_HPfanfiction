Kinda, yeah. A lot depends on how good the story was before that and how much good there is compared to how much bad. If it's a mediocre story overall with a terrible ending, that's bad. If it's amazing before that then I'll just remember the good parts.

And, too, people may disagree on what makes an ending horrible. For instance, there was a story (the author took it down) called "Hit the Ground Running" that had a very abrupt ending where Dumbledore killed Harry when he found out the horcrux in his head had awoken and was influencing him. A LOT of people hated the ending but I thought it was really appropriate and made sense considering everything else that had gone on in the story.
