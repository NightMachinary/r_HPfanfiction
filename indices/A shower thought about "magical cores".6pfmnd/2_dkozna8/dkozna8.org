The wand cores are just a part of magical creatures though and not some specialised organ. Also both unicorns and phoenixes have multiple hairs/feathers, can live without them and they have different materials with magical properties like blood for unicorns and tears for phoenixes. So it's not in any way similar to magical cores.
