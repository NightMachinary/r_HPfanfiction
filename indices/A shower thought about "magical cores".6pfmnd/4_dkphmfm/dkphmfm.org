I would like to argue that Wands and Staves DO NOT /need/ cores in order to work, the cores, however, do amplify the Magic a user out puts and probably acts as a better focus. I assume that you can widdle a piece of wood finely and it could act as a channel for Magic just as well. Wands in the Potterverse have probably become more personalised and are no longer a tool and more of a companion for Wizards.

As for your argument, I dislike the idea of a Magical 'core' tbh. I think Magic just flowing through the Wizards body at a constant rate and when you use a spell it generates more is a much better idea. Because the size of the Magical Core automatically means the Power of the Wizard, but when Magic flows through your body, it's more of the quality of the Magic that decides how powerful it is, though there are some people who naturally have a higher capacity for storage etc....

I'm surprised no one has actually asked Rowling about this on Twitter.
