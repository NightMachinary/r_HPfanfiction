I think you're right. The horcrux really was limiting Harry's magical core. However when he casts heavy light spells like the pertronus, the light magic temporarily pushes back the dark magic of the horcrux. It explains why he was able to fight back 100 dementors. Harry must have an insane magical core... probably on the same level as voldy and dumbledore...
