Except that they aren't canon and I can imagine my magical world how I want, thank you.

I can even ignore (gasp!) that Rowling said that magic is genetic, and just roll my own for my fanfiction. Because my fanfiction is /my/ story, and I dictate the rules.

However, when we are discussing how canon is interpreted we should stick to the text - and not our imaginations. And in the text there isn't much argument for magical cores.
