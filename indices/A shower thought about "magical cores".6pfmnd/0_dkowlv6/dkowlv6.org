  If so, all the tropes surrounding magical cores may be reasonably close to canon.

The deduction you make is over-the-top. Many of those (magical exhaustion, ...) don't have much basis in canon, regardless of the existence of cores.

Fleur's wand for example has hair of her grandmother. Indeed, it seems that a lot of materials are useful, such as phoenix feathers, dragon heartstring, troll-whiskers, ...

It seems more likely that /every single fiber/ - including hair and whiskers! - of a magical being can channel magic, making an argument for the absence of any physical core.
