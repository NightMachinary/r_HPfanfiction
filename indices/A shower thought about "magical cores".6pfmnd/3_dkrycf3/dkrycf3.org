Here's the way I would use magical cores if I decided too.

Core Magic is the most developed system of magic with the most spells made and so that is what is taught in schools. Generations of wizards have contributed to this system and it is the most widely understood way to use magic. It's like Windows is for computers.

However cores only exist because you're looking for them. You're expecting them to be there and so they show up when you look. You can develop spells for them, you can measure their output, etc... but ultimately this is all an illusion. Cores don't actually exist. Wizards are aware of this but practicality trumps uncertainty. The system works so they use it.

In this way there can also be other spells that are still mysteriously magical.
