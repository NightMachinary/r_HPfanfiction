I have to point out that characterisation in canon is not consistent. The characters often act out of character for plot reasons. One of the best examples is that Hermione and especially Ron suddenly dismiss Malfoy's plotting in book 6, after years of knowing better. That's blatantly plot railroading, so Malfoy gets away with his plotting, and runs counter to both their characterisation. Or the many, many cases of Dumbledore not acting as a wizard of his power and experience should, so kids can be the heroes.

I generally don't consider HPB and DH, and parts of OotP, when characterising the trio.
