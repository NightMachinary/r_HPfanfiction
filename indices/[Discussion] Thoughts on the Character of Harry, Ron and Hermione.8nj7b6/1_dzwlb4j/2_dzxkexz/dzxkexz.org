  Correct me if I'm wrong (haven't read the books in over a year), but Ron initially said nothing, and then Harry came to confront him.

If anything, I'd say that it is Harry who acted worse during their fight. Ron is clearly trying to be happy for Harry. But when Ron repeats Harry's own words back to him, Harry implies that Ron is stupid. It is only after Harry reacts less than positively that Ron gives up trying to actively support his friend. even when they are not talking, Ron is very concerned about Harry. When Harry breaks the conversation off with Sirius, it is Harry who overreacts: he decides he hates everything about Ron, throws a badge at his head and doesn't apologize for it, starts shouting at him, and storms upstairs to the dormitory. Ron just stands there and takes it.
