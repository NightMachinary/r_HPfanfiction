I believe that Ron's loyalty should largely be unquestioned. His two fallouts in books 4 and 7, were results of arguments with Harry. Correct me if I'm wrong (haven't read the books in over a year), but Ron initially said nothing, and then Harry came to confront him. Ron even came to check up on Harry when he was out of bed talking to Sirus. Harry exploded on him again, even resulting to throwing things at him (I think). Ron never wore the â€˜Potter Stinks' badges. And in the end, only Ron apologized, when clearly Harry had his stake in the breakup. In book 7, Ron was upset because they didn't have a plan. Dumbledore kept too many cards to his chest and died before he could share with Harry. As a result, they went months or weeks (?) with no leads at all. Ron exploded about that, and they fell into another argument. In the end, Harry yelled at him to leave, and he did. He even wanted to come back soon after, but couldn't due to snatchers.

P.S. I think Ron is easily above average and right up there with Harry and Hermione. He has a quick draw (quicker than Hermione's), can stun a death eater on a broom stick (said to be good by Tonks, an auror) and even was the first to break the silencing spell against Voldemort, and escaped multiple snatchers on his own.
