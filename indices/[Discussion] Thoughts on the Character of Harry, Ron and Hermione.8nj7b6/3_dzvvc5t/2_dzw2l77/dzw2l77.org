To be clear, I do not say Ron gets a pass. What I meant was that its his personality. He defines himself by who he aligns with (his family, his friends, his house, etc.). Ron's problem seems to be a massive inferiority complex.

As for Hermione, logic is not quite the right word. I would say she is structurally oriented. She sees things within the lens of evidence and facts. On the one hand she sides with him in the the 4th book, partly out of personal trust but also because she cannot see how or why he would do it and the authority figures believe him. In the 3rd book, Hermione goes to McGonagall about the broom, despite knowing what Harry would have wanted. She did the RIGHT thing, and made the rational choice, but others perceived her actions as betrayal. Even though she did it to keep him safe and unharmed. Loyalty and betrayal, are to put it bluntly, often in the eye of the beholder. She tries to stop Harry from going to the Ministry, but when he refuses to relent she concedes against her own misgivings. Her conflict is with her idea of authority: go to the teachers or find a book for help. She trusts authority, and she is most conflicted when Harry or Ron, or other people, are flaunting these figures.
