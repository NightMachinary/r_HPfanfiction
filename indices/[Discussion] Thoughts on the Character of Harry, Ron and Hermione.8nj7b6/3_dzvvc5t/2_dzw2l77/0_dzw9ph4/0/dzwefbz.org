True. But she sees Harry afterwards and he seemingly is not being punished. Like with the Ministry, this would suggest that since there is no punishment they don't believe he committed the crime. And as for authority figures, literally in the same conversation she tells him to write to Sirius for help. And I don't mean authority in a literal sense, but in more of "this person knows what there talking about and deserves to be obeyed" sort of manner.

Hermione, to me at least, has the most potential to develop differently out of the three. She somewhat naively starts out seeing the facts and knowledge and the statements of people in positions of power as almost sacrosanct. She breaks the rules reluctantly, but often its when the resident people she would turn to ignore them or refuse to listen (looking at you McGonagall). In the 4th book, and particularly in the 5th book, her trust in sources of authority like the Ministry and the Daily Prophet are eroded by flagrant mismanagement, ineptitude, or outright lying. She begins to question rules and people in power.

Once she does this, there is a distinct uptick in how vindictive and frankly hostile she can become. I have seen similar situations occur with people who have there long held beliefs shattered. She never fully goes through with the complete disintegration of her worldview, but as time passes more insidious or rebellious behavior seems to be acceptable to her. One could consider a downward spiral: if one person in power is lying/untrustworthy/malicious, how many others can be? I suspect its why she still grants Snape or Binns respect when everyone seems to agree they are not particularly good teachers.

On that note, I would love to see an Hermione-based story that explores this sort of shattering of her belief system. You could make an excellent story out of that, with Harry, now an older adult, has to take on and defeat the Dark Lady Hermione Granger. Thats a kickass story.
