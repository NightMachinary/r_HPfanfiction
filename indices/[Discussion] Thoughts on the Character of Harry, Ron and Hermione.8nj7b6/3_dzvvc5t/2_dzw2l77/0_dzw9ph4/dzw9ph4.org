On the Hermione bit. I don't think in the case of Book 4 that she even mentioned authority figures at all. With the exception of Dumbledore, Hermione couldn't see any authority's reaction (save for shock). She says the morning after that "Of course I knew it wasn't you" because Harry was so surprised by it. Like, I think outside of book 1, her deference to authority is a little overstated by some people. I mean, she goes along with a lot of rule breaking. :)
