I disagree about your assessment of Ron. I don't believe that neither Harry or Ron truly understood the severity of the tournament until it was too late. I also wouldn't have used the term ‘abandoned'. Ron was too quick to conclude the worst, and Harry unloaded on him before really got a chance to sort out his feelings. Ron didn't really voice that he thought Harry did anything. He did the ole silent treatment and Harry let him have it for it. Ron even still looked out for Harry, looking for him when he was out of bed. He unknowingly ended a conversation between Harry and Sirius. Harry yelled at him again, knowing that Ron did not do it on purpose and even resulted to throwing things at him ( I think). Abandonment implies that one person is solely responsible, when this is not the case. Even in year 7, Harry had screamed at him to leave. Hermione never really had this problem with Harry. I think that this is because Harry looks at Hermione like a sister, the motherly kind. The one that tells him to do his homework and wash behind his ears. So, Harry never took any of her ‘nagging' too personally.
