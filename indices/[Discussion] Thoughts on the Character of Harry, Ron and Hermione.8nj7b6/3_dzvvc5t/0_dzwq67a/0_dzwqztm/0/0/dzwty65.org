If you read before that passage on page 190, Hermione had already pointed out entering it meant facing likely lethal tasks:

  “People have died, though!” said Hermione in a worried voice as they walked through a door concealed behind a tapestry and started up another, narrower staircase.

  “Yeah,” said Fred airily, “but that was years ago, wasn't it? Any- way, where's the fun without a bit of risk? Hey, Ron, what if we find out how to get 'round Dumbledore? Fancy entering?” “What d'you reckon?” Ron asked Harry. “Be cool to enter, wouldn't it? But I s'pose they might want someone older. . . . Dunno if we've learned enough. . . .”

Harry even later says that his "desire" to enter "was a joke, really... an idle sort of dream." Even from what I quoted, he wasn't interested in it for the reasons the other are (glory and rule breaking), he just briefly thought of winning Cho over.

And I didn't say Ron offered nothing (Hermione's contributions were arguably the most, so I don't take issue with her), just that in a time he especially needed Ron, he ditched him for weeks (or was it months?) over almost nothing. I just think GoF and DH decrease just how loyal we can say Ron was. As for Harry, eh, it's again a bit asymmetrical. Since the story is from his perspective and features him personally in most of the life threatening situations, expecting more from him seems almost unfair.
