I agree with your points on how JKR treats Ron's arcs. My guess is that she really wanted to bring home how vital he is to the trio. Which she had largely ignored or minimized post book 4. So now, she has to find some way to make this known in a note able way. I thought Ron really shined in book 7, more than any other because of this. So now, Ron is gone and Harry and Hermione are as useful as chopped liver and then Ron comes back saves Harry, takes out the Horcrux and the show is back on the road. But most people can't get over the fact that he left to begin with. She could of had him kidnapped, mind controlled by a death eater, anything really. But having him leave under equal conditions (outside of his family being in danger) to Harry and Hermione only makes him look weak( I don't think this, but it's not an uncommon opinion). So even with all the good things he did, that was his biggest moment, and it's not a Kodak moment.

I agree with Arthur's death pushing Ron and Harry to an extent even.
