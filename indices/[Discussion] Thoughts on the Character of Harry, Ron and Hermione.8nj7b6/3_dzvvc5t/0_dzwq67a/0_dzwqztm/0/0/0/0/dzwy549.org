Some good points. But the examples I mentioned just seem to be ditching, and in book 4 Ron broke off entirely on his own. Both are bad in their own ways. His departure in DH is at least understandable (Horcrux family in danger, deep feelings of inadequacy being around Harry and Hermione and his siblings). But in GoF is was just jealously (okay, I'm probably belaboring this point). He already knew it was lethal. I know they took it lightly before, but that's because they weren't entering.

To be honest, I probably wouldn't let this annoy me so much if JKR hadn't had Ron have a repeat in DH. It was just a terrible time and made the other rushed elements worse ("Hey, now I totally think house elves should be free." /kiss/). If anything should have happened (as I think JKR admitted), Arthur should have died in OoTP and that should have been the impetus for Ron's final development. That would make him better able to function as his role as the heart of the group, and makes him able to relate to Harry more and would cleanly clear up jealousy issues (i.e. "Do I really want to be so jealous of a bloke who has no worthwhile loving relatives and who is always in danger?"). But alas...
