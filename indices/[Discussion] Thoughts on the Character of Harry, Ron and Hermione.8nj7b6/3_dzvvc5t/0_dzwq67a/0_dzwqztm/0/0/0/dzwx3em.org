Hermione is just reiterating what Dumbledore said about a page before. To your point, I had thought Harry and Ron had given the tournament more thought than what was really in text. Harry was more occupied with Sirius. Ron was dealing with his father's negative press and Crouch-Moody. Neither one made any real attempts at getting in, so....yeah. But, I don't think that totally negates my first point about them taking the tournament too lightly. At the point of my quote, it's just a way for glory and Cho. He does want glory at least a little bit (his arms raised in triumph in front of the whole school, all of whom were applauding and screaming)

It becomes real to him when his name comes out of the goblet. However for Ron, it does not hit him until Harry's life is in danger with the dragons.

I wasn't accusing you of thinking Ron offered anything. I personally don't think that Hermione's contributions are even arguable. She is flat out the most important of the three. Harry and Ron kind of toss the idiot ball around, while Hermione is off to the side with a book looking at them disapprovingly. Again, I wouldn't use the word â€˜ditched'. In both instances ( book 4 and 7), Harry pushed Ron away. I'm not trying to absolve Ron, but Harry has his share of the blame. If both are to blame, can one be more loyal than the other? Harry is an orphan, who was abused by the Dursleys, and then got his life threatened every year of Hogwarts. So, he deserves a break. But lesser people than Hermione and Ron would have long stopped associating with him. And this is something that Harry doesn't really stop to appreciate enough if at all.
