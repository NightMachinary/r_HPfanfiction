“I might go in for it, you know,” Ron said sleepily through the darkness, “if Fred and George find out how to . . . the tournament . . . you never know, do you?”

“S'pose not. . . .”

Harry rolled over in bed, a series of dazzling new pictures forming in his mind's eye. . . . He had hoodwinked the impartial judge into believing he was seventeen . . . he had become Hogwarts champion . . . he was standing on the grounds, his arms raised in triumph in front of the whole school, all of whom were applauding and screaming . . . he had just won the Triwizard Tournament. . . . Cho's face stood out particularly clearly in the blurred crowd, her face glowing with admiration. . . .

Harry grinned into his pillow, exceptionally glad that Ron couldn't see what he could. ( GOB page 192)

Dumbledore had explained the tournament and why it stopped happening the same day as this quote. Harry and Ron are just a little loose in the head. I do agree with you that the fault largely lies with Ron. I just wanted to express that it didn't SOLELY lie with him. I also agree that Harry deserves some leeway. But at the same time, Ron and Hermione gave (Physical and Emotional support) to Harry immensely more than Harry ever gave to them.
