Fair enough. Ron seems to suffer from something common in large families: an inferiority complex. Whatever he has, its never enough. That his big problem, and honestly it seems to be the real problem with Ron that is rarely portrayed accurately.

To be clear, I am NOT excusing his actions. What I was trying to point out is that its part of his personality to trust somewhat blindly. This is in conflict with his sense of pride (deserved or otherwise) and his sense that he can never live up to "insert-name-here."

Speaking from personal experience, I have had someone I considered my best friend turn against me on some poor excuse, and broke off our friendship. I accepted it, and I did not hate them for it, because I knew he was going through VERY difficult personal times (involving abuse among other things). Three years later, when I was in town, he wrote a long letter to me that apologized in great detail. He wanted to meet up to apologize in person but was afraid I would hate him or spurn him. But I didn't, and I met up with him in person, and we have remained friends since. I knew my friend had an inferiority complex, and he got nothing from apologizing to me and trying to make amends. But he cared enough about our history and friendship in the past that he still wanted to try again.

Loyalty is a catch all word. That's true. But frankly, everyone has a breaking point in terms of what they can take. And more to the point, its easy to judge someone in a clinical manner and say "they betrayed them and should burn for it" when you are on the outside. Ron and Hermione deserve the utmost respect for siding with Harry against everything and almost everyone, considering almost every bad thing that happens to them is related to there friendship with Harry.
