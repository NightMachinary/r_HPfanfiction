Thanks for taking my post seriously.

Before I say anything else, I would point out that I do not disagree with the idea that Ron betrayed Harry (though betrayal is like loyalty in that what counts differs from person to person). My point was never that he did not waver, but that he defines himself by who he aligns with. Thats the meaning of the word loyalty, who you side with or believe. And while he definitely wavers, its worth pointing out that:

1) Ron does not actively go around championing that Harry is a cheater/liar during the 4th book, instead not talking to him and/or ignoring him. Every scene during there fight indicates he wants to reconcile, but is too proud or scared to apologize (possibly both).

2) When Ron leaves in DH, he immediately realizes his screw up and tries to go back. But he can't. He is so ashamed of his disloyalty to his friends that he hides and mopes about it. He breaks for a moment (when combined with an insanely dark object with mind-manipulation abilities), and he mopes and dwells on it for months. He comes back because of his loyalty, even though by all rights he could be completely rejected. Its how he sees himself, and failing to live up to it is where he is the most embarrassed.

Case in point, when explaining the Deluminator to Harry, he states about Dumbledore:

"[Dumbledore] knew what he was doing when he gave me the Deluminator, didn't he? He -- well," Ron's ears turned bright red and he became engrossed in a tuft of grass at his feet, which he prodded with his toe, "he must've known I'd run out on you." "No," Harry corrected him. "He must've always known you'd always want to come back." (DH, Ch. 20)

And I am not sure you understand the circumstances around Hermione and Ron. She is a muggle-born, and more importantly she is an idealist with regards to rights and status of different groups (not disagreeing with her, but she does not approach the issues pragmatically, which is oddly OOC). Her statement to Griphook in Deathly Hallows is a testament to this, eventually she will be hunted down in some manner, however long that takes. Ron, conversely, is a pureblood. While his family are labeled blood-traitors, the Death Eaters do not immediately liquidate all their opponents once they take over the Ministry and have near unlimited power in Britain. Much like the Nazis or the Imperial Japanese Army, they operated based on ideology and not sound tactical thinking, and it cost them in the end. Since they did not immediately wipeout the Weasley family or seriously interrogate them, its clear the Death Eaters care more about preserving blood than long term stability. Ron could easily claim Harry betrayed him or mind wiped him, and he has seen the error of his ways. They may not believe him, but another hostage at Hogwarts would probably be pretty hard to ignore.

Besides which, the poison wine in HBP, the chess match results in SS, and the acromantula adventure in CoS suggest Ron is put in more danger because of his friendship, not less. In the end, he and Hermione came out as famous because of their role in the war, but they had no idea how any of that would turn out in the end.
