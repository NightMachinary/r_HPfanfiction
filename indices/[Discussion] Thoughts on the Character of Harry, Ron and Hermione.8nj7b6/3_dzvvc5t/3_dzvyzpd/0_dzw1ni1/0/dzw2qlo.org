  Loyalty is a catch all word. That's true. But frankly, everyone has a breaking point in terms of what they can take.

Sure! But that's exactly where loyalty is shown. It is easy to be "loyal" when you want to take that course of action anyway (be it out of self preservation, convenience aka not rocking the boat or because there's other potential gains) or when it is no hardship to you. You can only show loyalty when it is actually a hardship and if at that point other considerations are a priority you aren't really all that loyal.

And of course loyalty isn't some kind of all or nothing deal. In fiction often loyalty is tested when someone's life is on the line, which some might consider to be an idealistic standard, but on the other hand there's people who risk their lives for complete strangers. Maybe it isn't such a tall order for a close friend or family member?

Signs of dis-loyalty are things like abandoning friends for petty reasons (like social standing and being slightly uncomfortable).

  Ron and Hermione deserve the utmost respect for siding with Harry against everything and almost everyone, considering almost every bad thing that happens to them

In case of Hermione I agree.

For Ron though that's complete bullshit. He's involved either way: He's from a family of blood-traitors who are members of Dumbledore's Order. Whether he is friends with Harry or not is completely irrelevant to him having to fight Voldemort (unless he's willing to betray his entire family and run away to Australia). The Horcrux Hunt is probably an enjoyable vacation in comparison to what would have happened to him and his big mouth at Hogwarts when facing the Carrows. Being friends with Harry is extremely beneficial to him and may raise his chances of survival. There's no way for him to just lay back and stay out of the fight - not to mention that his nature wouldn't allow him to do that anyway.

Hermione has no stake in this fight, she could just take her parents and run.
