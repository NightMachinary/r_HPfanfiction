  Not talking to someone is somehow because you're arguing is somehow abandoning them?
#+end_quote

Abandoning is deluding oneself that their best friend entered a life threatening tournament for glory, despite knowing that friend hates his own fame and doesn't like almost being killed annually. It was stated to be jealousy (which was kind of obvious regardless).

  He doesn't despise Harry. He despises that the very things he wants out of life fall right into his lap. Never once has he said anything bad about Harry.
#+end_quote

I think claiming Harry is "getting ready for his press briefings" before being forced into a deadly tournament is a pretty bad aspersion to cast. I don't think Ron is an awful person, but he's not some ever-loyal friend everytime it counts (e.g. when most of the school turns on you.) And besides which, I don't think it's wrong to be upset at some thngs, but for christ's sake Harry's wealth comes from a family he'll never know and his fame is a constant reminder of what he could never get back. I'm fine with Ron's reactions provided he has to face real consequences, but he never did.

  More like because his family is in danger because of him choosing to be a good friend while he sits in a tent all day, trying to find a needle in a haystack all the while starving and being manipulated by a piece of Voldemort's soul.
#+end_quote

This applied to everyone in the tent. Also, the Weasleys were in danger no matter if he went on the hunt or not. This is not only obvious (since the Weasleys are well known blood traitors and friends of Dumbledore) but the Ministry believed him to be sick with spattergroit at home anyway. His actions in DH are at least more understandable than in GoF, but it was another time where he messes up and we don't actually see him grow from it.
