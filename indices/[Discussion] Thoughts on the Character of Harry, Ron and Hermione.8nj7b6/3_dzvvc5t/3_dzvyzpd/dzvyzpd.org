Loyalty according to Ron lovers:

- talking shit behind your friends back

- abandoning them during a deadly tournament

- constantly despising and envying them for their popularity and them stealing the limelight

- abandoning them again during most desperate of times, because you're hungry

I've come to the conclusion that discussing loyalty with people who love Ron is like trying to explain evolution to creationists. "You keep using that word, I don't think it means what you think it means"
