Overall, this is pretty spot on, but a couple of errors:

#+begin_quote
  Ron is loyal, despite what some believe. In the 4th book, Ron never stopped being loyal to Harry: he never believed Harry put his name in the Goblet, he just could not get over the fact that he did not stand out in any way
#+end_quote

Ron may not have believed Harry really put his name in (its ambiguous, even Hermione couldn't so for certain), but he was not being loyal when he abandoned his friend who was being put into another life threatening situation against his will. Hermione believed it was jealously. You are right to say it was rooted in her feelings of inadequacy though, but I don't think he gets a special pass with the Locket. Harry dealt with its effects and the pain it induced in his scar as well. It's understandable, but you can't ignore it to safeguard the idea that Ron is unwaveringly loyal.

The bit about Hermione trusting Harry because she is very logic oriented isn't quite right. Her and Harry's mutual trust isn't based on logic per se, just loyalty forged through life risking scenarios, their personal dispositions and their history's (neither had friends before Hogwarts). Hermione says the next morning after his name came out the goblet that she knew Harry hadn't put his name in because he was too shocked by it. Same with the Voldemort resurrection, she starts (in general) assuming Harry is being truthful because he's not the type to lie to friends. She doesn't look for evidence to the contrary first, she accepts it and plans accordingly. Unless it's something Harry isn't reliable on; some criticize her for not immediately accepting Malfoy's suspicious behavior, but it's not totally unreasonable. Harry despises Draco and they had already made the mistake in thinking Draco was the villain in Chamber of Secrets.

Overall, this is mostly right though.
