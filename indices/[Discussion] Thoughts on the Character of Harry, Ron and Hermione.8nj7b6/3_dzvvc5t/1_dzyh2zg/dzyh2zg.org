  but he was not being loyal when he abandoned his friend who was being put into another life threatening situation against his will.
#+end_quote

And Harry wasn't being a good friend by giving his best friend the ultimatum of "Believe me or fuck off. I know I said yesterday that I'd put my name in if I could and they're throwing a party for me downstairs, but I didn't put my name in. I also had a conversation with Dumbledore, where he told me someone may be trying to get to me, but you know, I'm not going to mention that."

  but I don't think he gets a special pass with the Locket.
#+end_quote

I think he gets a pass in the fact that because of his decision to starve in a tent, doing nothing for months, his family is in mortal danger. His sister is getting tortured at school. He nearly had his arm torn off. And every negative emotion he's bottled up over the last seventeen years is being exploited by an evil cursed locket.

  It's understandable, but you can't ignore it to safeguard the idea that Ron is unwaveringly loyal.

He is though. Tell me one time he actually turned on Harry. Ron may not have always been /at/ Harry's side, like Hermione, but there's never been a time he wasn't /on/ Harry's side, unlike Hermione.
