When it's an issue where he's facing mortal danger (which Hermione outright told them beforehand about the tournament) then I'm sorry, this is a bullshit comparison. And Harry didn't say he'd put his name in. He said if he wanted to enter the tournament he'd have entered at night away from everyone. Ron immediately assumed the worst for no reason, as if Harry had a history of glory seeking.

  I think he gets a pass in the fact that because of his decision to starve in a tent, doing nothing for months, his family is in mortal danger. His sister is getting tortured at school. He nearly had his arm torn off. And every negative emotion he's bottled up over the last seventeen years is being exploited by an evil cursed locket.

With the exception of family (though none of them knew what what actually happening at Hogwarts), those all applied to Harry and Hermione (the former of whom also had to deal with continuous physical pain from wearing the Horcrux).

  He is though. Tell me one time he actually turned on Harry. Ron may not have always been at Harry's side,

Unless your point is "Ron was never an antagonist to Harry", this point doesn't seem relevant. 4th year and 7th year both have Ron being unloyal. I can understand DH, but GoF was outright said to be pure jealousy.
