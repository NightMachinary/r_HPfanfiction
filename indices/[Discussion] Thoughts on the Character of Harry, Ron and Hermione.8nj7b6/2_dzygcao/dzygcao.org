  HARRY-a combination of ESTP/INFJ

  seems to hold Harry's quidditch talents in the highest regard (and is likely the thing that makes him jealous more than anything else)

I think it's the thing Ron wants in life simply falling into Harry's lap. Fame, fortune, glory. Ron is a keeper and has no reason to be jealous of any seeker beside Krum, who he was envious of because of his fame seemingly making him a better catch for Hermione, since Ron, like most pure-bloods, values status. I also think Ron is an ESFP/ENFP.

  I actually think Ron gets a bad rep. He is mostly an average to slightly-above average caliber person working amidst exceptional or infamous people. He cannot really match any of them, or rather he was rarely put into situations where his talents could really shine through

You're underestimating my boy. Ron was incredible, but he lacked the motivation to put forth effort. The boy went on to NEWT level in six subjects, yet being Ron, he probably didn't even study. Ron is the epitome of wasted potential. He's shown several times to be a remarkable wizard, but never saw the value in trying due to thinking he'd constantly be in someone else's shadow.
