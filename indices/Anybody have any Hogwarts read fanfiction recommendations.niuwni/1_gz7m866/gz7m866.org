There's the Reading the Books series by spirithorse16. I think it fits perfectly with what you want, mostly cannon personalities but not a Hinny fic, not a bashing fic either (yay) or I'd have been pissed because bashing is just stupid, AND I love Ginny. Though Snape does kinda what's coming for him. Overall nice reactions, although some can feel underwhelming but still enjoyable.

It's actually reached GoF, maybe halfway through if I remember correctly, and it's your lucky day because, lo and behold, the author just decided to end his hiatus today and is planning on uploading some new chapters this week!
