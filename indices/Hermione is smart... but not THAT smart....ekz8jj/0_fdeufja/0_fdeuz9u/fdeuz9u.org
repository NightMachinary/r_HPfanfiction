Not to be rude but I think you may have misinterpreted the meaning of this post. This is a fanfiction prompt, not a dissection of Hermione (and the others) academic performance.

That's why it's flaired as a "Prompt". Sort of an AU where Hermione is still great and still Hermione but the other students at Hogwarts out perform her anyway.
