Harry wasn't on Hermione's level, and I am purposefully inflating his abilities a little for the sake of my post, but he was still an incredibly talented wizard and he did outperform Hermione in a few areas in the series (which she admitted to) particularly with some of his spellcasting. That's why he was left in charge of the D.A. after all.
