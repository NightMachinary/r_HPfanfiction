Hmmm, it depends on which characters you're interested in. Harry and friends? Probably Sixth-year. That's the only one where the dynamics of Hogwarts remain relatively unchanged (No monsters inside the castle, no McGuffins like the Stone or Goblet [The Vanishing Cabinet really doesn't compare] no Tournaments)

But really, I think it does boil down to characters

Take Ginny and Luna. I have a soft spot for their platonic friendship. Fics for them can happen pretty much anytime and still remain relatively small in scope.

Case in point, "Fire and Air"
