If you're not using the main characters and just want teen drama then fourth year is best. You have the tasks each being gossip, the champions being prime gossip, potential drama between the students from different schools, and of course the most important event for teen girls, the ball.

If you want to find a window in canon using the main characters then sixth year. Other than stalking Malfoy, not much happened and the Slug-club provides mini dates. The characters are also of an age where they are able to date people with it being completely normal. Sure Harry know Voldemort is out there and Malfoy is up to something but its actually one of the quieter years.
