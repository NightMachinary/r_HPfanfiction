This fic, Hopeless, has the marauders sound like actual teenagers. Very natural dialogue. It's set before 7th year & is short- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2430569]]

All The Young Dudes is one of the longest fics I've ever read (188 chapters). It's Remus-centric and has really good writing. It won Marauder medals for its protrayal of James & Remus. I basically regard it as canon- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10057010/chapters/22409387]]

Have some others but I'd have to dig them up.
