I picked these not just for the excellent characterization, but the character growth, overall story, and writing quality.

Lily in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6622580/1/Puzzle][Puzzle]], linkffn(6622580). When the Lily of the original books is defined by her untarnished perfection and self-sacrifice, what happens when she can't protect the ones she loves, and Harry and James are dead? I like this conflicted Lily who lives in disgust and bitterness trying to cope with being the sole survivor of Voldemort's attack on Godric's Hollow.

Snape in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6306296/1/The-Apprentice][The Apprentice]], linkffn(6306296). A Peggy Sue Snape protagonist who has matured enough not to be instantly unlikeable. I enjoy this fic for going into the technical side of Potionmaking, with a Snape who pursues a Mastery and lets Lily make her own choices instead of obsessing over her.

Cedric in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4594634/1/FINDING-HIMSELF][Finding Himself]], linkffn(4594634). An AU where Cedric makes it out of the Graveyard, but is crippled. This explores Cedric as someone who isn't the Perfect Hufflepuff, but someone who tries to be the best version of himself, even if his body is falling apart. The author has published professionally and it shows.
