Bellatrix in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855): The author doesn't try to whitewash her, as she remains a deeply flawed person. But since she chose to follow Harry instead of Voldemort, she didn't fall down that rabbit hole, and could instead put her virtues to good use.

Draco in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6432055/1/Exile][Exile]], linkffn(6432055): He is still kind pathetic, but he has also earned his redemption here.

Dumbledore in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877): That's one cool manipulative!GreaterGood!Dumbledore.

Ginny in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/The-Changeling][The Changeling]], linkffn(6919395): Her growth in this story is phenomenal. I like this version of her a lot better than Canon.

Harry in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): He becomes increasingly brutal as the story goes on, and yet he remains fiercely protective of his friends. When he and Hermione are going on that suicide mission in the end, he 'orders' Neville to stay behind.

Hermione in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925): I have my greatest sympathy and respect for this Hermione, I wish she and Harry could get together in their new world.

Petunia in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/Petunia-Evans-Tomb-Raider][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider]], linkffn(13052802): This Petunia is strong and successful, she loved Lily and loves Harry, but she still nurses a huge inferiority complex and remains bitter throughout the story. She is still very much recognizable as her canon version.

Ron in [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: This Ron is model boyfriend.

Voldemort in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/Patron][Patron]], linkffn(11080542): Dumbledore is on top of his game, Harry is training hard, Lockhart is not a fraud, Fudge and his Ministry are reasonable, even Pansy is redeeming herself. But all that would not be enough, if Hermione and Aberforth has not picked up the slack. And no, canon Horcrux hunt would have never worked.
