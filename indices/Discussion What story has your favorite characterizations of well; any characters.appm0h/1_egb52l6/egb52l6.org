Riddle is far from my favourite character but i actually felt for him and even cried for him in linkffn(Luna Lovegood and the Dark Lords Diary) tbh I also thought an earlier chapter was the perfect ending

edit: Fiona from linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20) is also great because she is super stubborn and she really shows how zerrifying and unfair the use of magic can be for a muggle.

Mike from linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh) reminds me a lot of my Dad.
