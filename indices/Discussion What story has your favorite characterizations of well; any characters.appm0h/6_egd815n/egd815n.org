ECYRegen has a series of good female Harry Potter stories. The character manages to be well rounded, brave but not overly bold, and somewhat sullen but not emo like in canon.

I usually really dislike Harry paired with older men, especially Snape and LV because of the death eater angle, but there's an interesting subtext that something might later develop between Harry and Sirius in those stories (she's like 16 now). She also has an interesting subtext with Draco and Fred.
