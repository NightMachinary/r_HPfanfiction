I do. Perhaps it's just a whim.

My initial idea here is that he fully intends on sending him back, but also knows he's in a similar position to how he was: Dursley's, Voldemort etc.

Hadrian out of "the kindness of his heart" intends on training up Harry to prepare him to steamroll his world's version of Dumbledore and Voldemort. Thus allowing Harry freedom instead of imprisonment and allowing a younger, more innocent Harry to see the how and why behind this darker more cynical Hadrian. Maybe they'd begin to argue on how Hadrian views his old friends and teachers.

I'd like it if Dumbledore was a villain in Hadrian's world, but Harry's Dumbledore is the canon one (maybe misguided but still good), Hadrian unable to fathom a "good Dumbledore" and just thinking Harry is either still under his manipulators spell or plain stupid.
