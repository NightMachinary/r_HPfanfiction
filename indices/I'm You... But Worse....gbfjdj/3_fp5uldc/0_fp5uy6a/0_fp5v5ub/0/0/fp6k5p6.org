You could use a part of canon that's only implicitly stated, which is that the blood connection between Voldemort and Harry allowed Harry to come back to life by sacrificing the Horcrux instead of himself.

As Hadrian doesn't have anyone he shares that sort of blood connection with anymore (say, if it was based on Motherhood exclusively, to the point it couldn't be used through a blood-related child), he might connect the dots and reason that Harry's blood is enough for this connection to exist, which, if he forces Harry to create a Horcrux out of Hadrian, would insure his own immortality without costing him his soul in return.

The plan would then look like this:

- Hadrian somehow forces Harry to make a Horcrux out of Hadrian.

- Hadrian then uses the lingering echoes of Lily's magic on both their souls to prevent himself from being overtaken by the Horcrux

- Then, he places Harry in stasis, preventing him from affecting Hadrian through the Horcrux, and from destroying it through regret

- In this way, Hadrian's immortality is guaranteed, provided he has the Elixir of Life. That's a pretty prevalent trope, so he probably does

- He cannot age or die from disease, and if he is killed, then he'll sacrifice the Harry Horcrux for his return.

Of course, none of this actually has to happen, but I think it would be supremely interesting if it did. And it would of course create a very good reason as to why Hadrian protects Harry's life to all his ability.
