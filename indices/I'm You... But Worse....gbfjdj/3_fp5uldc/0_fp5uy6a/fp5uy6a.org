Exactly, my idea was with no prep, rhyme or reason, Harry would quickly be captured and "kept" by Hadrian. Then it would be a tale of trying to subtly destroy the establishment from within by instead appealing to the real support structure to his hierarchy (and the reason he's so politically powerful):

His wives.

My idea would be to have this become a story about the intricacies of contract law and blood magic, Harry able to do a lot of what Hadrian can get away with because they are the same person.
