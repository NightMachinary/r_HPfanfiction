This reminds me of linkffn(The Lone Traveler by dunuelos). There's a series of chapters in there where almost this exact situation occurs, except there's already a power struggle going on and he just tips the balance. It's not as developed as this idea seems, but it's so similar in premise it's eerie lol.
