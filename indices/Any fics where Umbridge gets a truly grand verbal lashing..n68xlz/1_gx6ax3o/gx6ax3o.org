The Umbridge in the sci-fi AU [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] got some serious nasty verbal and physical lashing, including:

- Two trips to a septic tank, followed by week long infection
- Verbally assaulted by an OC and then hunted down after
- Radioactively poisoned by Riddle's locket, "and Umbridge was far too sick to continue as a regular worker after a double mastectomy and chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant"
