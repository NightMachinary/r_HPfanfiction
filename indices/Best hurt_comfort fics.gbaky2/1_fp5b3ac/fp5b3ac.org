Finished: This goddamn cryfest by The Seeker. Saving Harry [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127417]] takes all the abuse that Harry went through in canon and analyses what a child in that situation may have ended up like. It is pure Hinny hurt/comfort injected into your veins, and absolutely heartbreaking. Luckily, the ending isn't tragic, so you won't endlessly wallow in tears.

Ongoing: Path Diverged [[http://siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=130353]] and it's sequel [[http://siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=130365]] by hp_fangal has a simple premise. Remember when Umbidge threatened to Crucio Harry in OotP? Yeah, that actually happens. The single change leads to a bunch a differences that could be arguably better or worse than canon. For example, Hinny happens earlier for some great Hurt/Comfort, but Harry was still tortured for an /hour./

Finished: In Care Of by Fang's Fawn, linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4927160/1/In-Care-Of]]) is a fic where Harry finds an injured bat in the Dursley's back garden and decides to nurse it back to health. What he doesn't know, is that the bat is actually Snape. A heartbreaking story about Severus learning about how spoilt Harry really is, and he's pissed at it all.
