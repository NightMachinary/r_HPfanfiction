WW2/Grindelwald's War was ongoing so

- People being conscripted/volunteering for the military (or the Red Cross, etc).
- Refugees from the continent.
- Grindelwald supporters or spies among the students
- Muggle relatives being affected by air raids or rationing.
- Delegation arriving to seek Dumbledore's help.

This was before the curse on the defense position so you could have a duelling club/tournaments.
