You could involve the war somehow. Isn't that the time where Grindelwald and his crew of psychos rampaged through mainland Europe? Tom Riddle attended Hogwarts from 1938 to 1945, exactly during the WW2.

Maybe write about some students that want to recruit Riddle as a Knight or something, and they get pissed when he rejects their offer. Something like that.\\
Or he accepts just out of curiosity to learn more about his... enemy? and then he meets someone there that he makes friends with. He learns that the individual is forced to participate by his parents who are supporters of Grindelwald - while the individual is fully against it because... reasons.\\
Maybe it's a She and forced to marry one of Grindelwald's bad boys after graduating? Who knows!\\
Or its a He and his parents want him to join the front and prove himself as a worthy /Knight of the Greater Good/, but he is miserable at combat while at the same time a genius pioneer that Riddle started to respect due to his skills.
