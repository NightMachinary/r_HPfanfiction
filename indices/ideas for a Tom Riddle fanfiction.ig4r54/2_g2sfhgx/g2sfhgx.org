You can play with fashion of the Wizarding world. Would it be influenced by declining economy situation on muggle side? We see clothing ideas in fantastic beast but mostly in American MACUSA, how does it looked like in Britain?

We see the students in uniforms not unlike in muggle schools but would they really use sth like that in Hogwarts? Why not sth more modest or Victorian?
