I was a passive aggressive dick who kept skirting one of their most subjective rules.

Apparently, sending them a message saying,

#+begin_quote
  Thank you for your time, but I'm done
#+end_quote

was the last straw for them. When I went back the next day and apologized, they told me that they would not accept the apology, I'd been skirting the edges of the rules for too long, I was a piece of ****, and that I would either have to leave the subreddit forever, or be banned forever.

I asked to appeal a year later, and they said "Hell no."
