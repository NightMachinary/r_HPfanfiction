*The Phoenix and the Serpent.*

Darker yes, grimdark no, terror/realism better than canon, angst some, mystery yes. There is romance but it's not the center of the story, there's a nice twist on it too. It's incomplete, but it's really gripping and well-executed, which is even more impressive when you consider it's from 2002. (Since OOTP hadn't come out at that point, there's no OOTP, no Luna, no Horcruxes, and no Umbridge, which actually allows the author to do some things that are really different from your usual 6th year fanfics.)

And the story literally begins with Harry dropping out of the Quidditch team, so there you go.
