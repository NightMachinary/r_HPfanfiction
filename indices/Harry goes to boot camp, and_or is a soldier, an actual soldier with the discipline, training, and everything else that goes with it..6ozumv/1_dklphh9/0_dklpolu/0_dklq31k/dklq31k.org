After Voldemort's return, Fudge, doesn't try to deny the Dark Lord's return - but, influenced by Malfoy, opts for an Appeasement policy to try and avoid a war (not entirely unjustified, seeing as Britain isn't exactly ready for a war). But while reducing the rights of the muggleborns (thanks to Dumbledore, Britain's much more egalitarian then most of the other countries in that area) does keep the Dark Lord from making an overt move (he's quietly subverting the Wizengamot instead), it also riles up the muggleborns, who can see the parallels to Germany in the 1930s. So Hermione starts a muggleborn resistance group and prepares for a guerilla war. Things don't go entirely according to plan, as usual in a war, and soon Britain is facing a civil war with several factions - Muggleborn Resistance, Death Eaters, Ministry, Order of the Phoenix. Various splinter groups mess things up further as things spiral out of control. The Muggleborn Resistance hire mercenaries to train them as soldiers, and use a mix of muggle weapons, bombs, and magic to fight their battles. Dumbledore does his best to get the Ministry pointed at the Death Eaters instead of the muggleborns and to counter Voldemort's political power. Harry and Ron are trained by Moody, and search for Horcruxes thanks to Harry's link to Voldemort. Later, Dumbledore takes over their training.
