Some comments:

- Not all parts are enjoyable for me, but some parts are very enjoyable.
- The amount of politics, strategies, and tactics involved is amazing. The author obviously knows his stuffs.
- Harry would be considered OP in most other HP fics, but not so much in this story because one person's power mattered far less in wars involving thousands of wizards and millions of Muggle soldiers. This Harry was a bloodthirsty one and loved leading his troops personally. His presence often gave them decisive advantages, but also caused severe complications.
- The pace varies. Except for the early war in France, I think the pacing is generally good. The story has mostly covered years between 2008 and 2023.
- Character developments are heavily tied to the overall political and military situations. Harry, Neville, Ginny, Astoria, Gabrielle, and Xenophilius Lovegood are the 6 major Canon characters undergoing the most changes because of the circumstances. OCs are very important, especially Harry's wife Ellie, senior advisor Albert Hughes, and SIS spy Josefina.
- A very interesting theme in this story is the constant and hostile factionalism in Harry's court, and how he balances and plays the factions to his benefits.
