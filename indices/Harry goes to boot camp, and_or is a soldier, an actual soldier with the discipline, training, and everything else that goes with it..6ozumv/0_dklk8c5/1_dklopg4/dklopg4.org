I've heard a lot about this story, some good, some bad. Could you help clear some of it up. Is harry OP in any way in this, and if so to what extent, and when does he become OP. Does the story have a slow pace or fast pace, and lastly how would you describe the character development in this.

I look forward to hearing back from you. Anyone else's opinion is also welcome.
