Recommend you find Harry Potter and the Charm of Venus by Marjorie Greene, in particular the version posted on her own site (marjorie.auroris.net). Despite mis-spellings and ignoring canon in various ways, it portrays all the involved characters as complete characters. The descriptions are rich, the emotions believable and the sex is varied. There are even some supplementary drawings by the author, with links within the story text. Fair warning - Hermione starts off quite out-of-character but for reasons that are explained later.
