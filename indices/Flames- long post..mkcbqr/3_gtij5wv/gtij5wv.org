I went and read the review that Osborn wrote and I'm not sure if it's just me but what he said didn't seem too bad. Sure he was rude and not very constructive but it's not anything I would have spent time thinking about and working myself up over yet it's obvious that It did affect you a good deal considering how much you wrote about him. Your message about how writers shouldn't quit because of mean comments was a good one but you gave Osborn way too much attention honestly he's probably already saw your rant and is just marinating in pleasure because he now knows he's hurt your feelings.
