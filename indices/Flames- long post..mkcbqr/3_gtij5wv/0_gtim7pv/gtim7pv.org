It always sucks getting a review like the one I got, and it will always sting, if you care about your work. I just won't let it affect how I go about writing my story. And yes, I did feed the troll, which one should never do. It's what keeps them alive.

The reason you don't see what Osborn wrote as that bad, is probably because he only attacked my work, and not me personally, which is all too common.

Now, this post of mine is honestly not so much about what he wrote about my work (even though it triggered it), as it's about flaming/rudeness in general. I've seen so many disgusting comments, and what I got is fairly tame, in comparison. I've always hated it. We should treat each other with respect.
