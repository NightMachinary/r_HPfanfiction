Imma be honest with you, I have indeed let bad reviews effect my inspiration to write a story, which led to it being abondened. It's a struggle every fanfic writer has to bear and sometimes it just is too much and you start to lose the motivation to continue. It makes me glad this hasn't happened to you and I would actually really like to read your story, so could you please share the link?
