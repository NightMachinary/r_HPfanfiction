linkffn(A Champion of the Light)

Since you're a girl, a Harry/Multi fic may not be up your alley. (I'm profiling, yay!) I refused to write a smut fic, there is enough porn, that we don't need to make porn of HP.

Instead, I wanted to spend my time trying to give each of Harry's women a distinct personality and an active role in the story.

Perhaps I should tell you the biggest problem people have with my story; apparently my very kind and goodhearted Harry does not turn into a killer quick enough, and his struggle to do so in 'unnecessary drama'.

I looked to comics for inspiration, and I kind of modelled the kind of hero my Harry is, on Peter Parker and Clark Kent, so him going on a killing spree the day he begins his quest makes no sense.

Now, if you do decide to go for it, I'd love to hear what you think!
