*A Texan Potter in King Albus's Court*

James and Lily Potter made sure that if something happened to them when they went into hiding, Harry would be protected. Instead of going to the Dursleys, Harry instead goes to Texas where the descendants of Abraham Potter -- one of the original 12 Aurors in the United States of America -- are now living. Sirius, Remus, and Hagrid take him there to ensure his safety and end up staying. Due to pressures placed on Harry by The Wizengamot, he is forced to return to Hogwarts and compete in the Triwizard Tournament. Raised by the Potter clan with the three f's of Texas: family, freedom, and firearms, the British Wizarding World will never be the same.
