*The Snowstorm over Svalbard*

The war is over and life as an Auror is good for Harry Potter. Until he's assigned to go investigate mysterious storms in the Arctic. Bringing along his partner, Daphne Greengrass, he makes his way into Svalbard, where myth becomes truth and the truth is far more sinister than anyone would have guessed.

--------------

*An Abnormal Amalgamation*

The Veil which kept the Eldritch Truth away from seeing eyes is ripped away, and horrified by what becomes of the world, Harry travel back in time to stop it. Harry's not sure what's worse, however --- the eldritch horrors, teaming up with Tom Riddle, or being reborn in his mother's body.

*Murder on the Hogwarts Express*

The war is over and Harry is on his way to Hogwarts for his seventh year. However, an hour into their ride, someone is murdered. Fingers are pointed, trust is tested, an unlikely partnership is formed, and Harry is put under extreme pressure yet again. How many will be murdered before the killer is caught?

--------------

*The Terrible No Good Day*

Harry Potter liked his life. It was nice, peaceful, and the danger of his youth had dwindled down to an occasional date-gone-wrong with Daphne. So he was quite displeased when dark wizards take everybody hostage at a gala. He's sick of saving the day, but what other choice does he have?

--------------

*Flower and Feather*

The first Battle of Hogwarts takes a disastrous turn, leaving more than Dumbledore dead. Harry begins the Hunt for the Horcruxes without Ron or Hermione. Fleur and Fawkes, however, having lost Bill and Dumbledore, respectively, won't let him do it alone. Harry/Fleur, no bashing.
