*Shattered*

The moment He touched the Philosopher's Stone was the moment everything changed. Everyone, even His old family, gave Him pitying looks and pleaded for Him to get help, but He was stronger than ever now. Yes, He was crazy, but He was not stupid. Madness was not a weakness and He would prove them all how wrong they were.

Still not happy with it. I hate summaries.
