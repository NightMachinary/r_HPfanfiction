*The Infinite*

A twist of fate, and Harry falls with Sirius through the Veil. With his strength, a little luck, and the help of someone unknown, Sirius and Harry emerge, far away in space and time... (specifically, the Firefly-verse)

*Fight Fear with Fire*

Harry learns something different in Fourth Year DADA, and when cornered in the Graveyard, surrounded by Death Eaters and Voldemort, he unleashes Fiendfyre.

*(I don't have a name for this one)*

Dumbledore is a little more worried after the Triwizard Tournament, and tries to summon someone with "the Knowledge to defeat Voldemort." Imagine his surprise when he summons a Muggle, who has happened to have read 7 childrens' books...
