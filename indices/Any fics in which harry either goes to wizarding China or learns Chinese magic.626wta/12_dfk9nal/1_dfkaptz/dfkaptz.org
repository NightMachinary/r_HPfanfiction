Depends on how it's written. the difference between cultural exchange/appropriation can be boiled down to 'do I respect the people of this culture as much as I respect the culture?' Easy way to handle it in fanfic is to introduce several characters of that culture and be respectful of them (aka not writing them as willing to drop everything to teach The Mighty Whitey).

This fic uses Korean magic and culture in a respectful and fascinating way through an OC Korean-British magical immigrant family. It's also a Sherlock crossover and Christianity themes come into play later in the fic. Linkffn(a study in magic)
