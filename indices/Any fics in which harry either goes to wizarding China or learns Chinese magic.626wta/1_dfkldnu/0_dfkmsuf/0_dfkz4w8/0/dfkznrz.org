That Korean surname Cho is a different character in Chinese and also has different origin. Korean uses many Chinese characters too.

I need to point out that MANY Chinese characters have the SAME pronunciation.

As I explained before, Cho in HP was Cantonese, and it would be pronounced differently in main Chinese.

That friend of yours probably didn't take that into consideration.
