JKR did her research well. Cho (秋), or Qiu in modern [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin][Pinyin]], is a common Chinese girl name and means 'Autumn' in English. We can further deduce that Cho was from Canton region because this pronunciation of the character 秋 is standard Cantonese.

Her last name Chang is pronounced [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_(surname][Zhang]]) in modern Pinyin. It's the third most common family name in China, and a census in 2007 identified 87.50 million bearers of that name.
