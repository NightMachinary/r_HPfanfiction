America would be bizarre. You'd have native Americans with their own type of magic. You've got to imagine a least a few muggleborns escaping America to do to the UK. Do Presidents react differently to the fact that magic exist? How does that fly with the religious beliefs of many of them, and how do you even get around security which has to be way tighter. We see this world in Fantastic Beast, but modern day America would probably be even 10X worse.
