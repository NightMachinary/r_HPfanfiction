The author needs to have a good understanding of traditional Chinese culture, which is something rather rare in English-speaking countries.

China has its own brand of literature dealing with supernatural abilities, mostly in the form of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuxia][Wuxia Genre]]. Its most famous author is Jin Yong (or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin_Yong][Louis Cha]] in English), whose books have sold for several hundred million copies so far. When I was working in China as an expat, I had the opportunity to watch several adaptations of his novels on TV. They were generally entertaining, but highly violent, at least far more so than the canon HP Books, and parents mostly let their children watch them. One movie adaptation, the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swordsman_II][Swordsman II]] starring Jet Li, was also shown in English movie theaters.

I have no idea about how Communists are going to deal with magic. Historically speaking, China never had a state religion, and was never hostile to magic or other supernatural powers based on religious grounds. Its rulers would promote or persecute groups depending on whether they supported or opposed the Imperial court.

So my speculation is that Chinese Magical population was split and fought a long civil war, with factions supporting and opposing the Communists. However, China has made huge progress in recent decades, which leads me to think that the regime had made peace with hostile Magical factions in its own country, and could focus on becoming a superpower once again.
