I feel the same, though I would go further and say all the martial artists are actually wizards. 'Chi' or 'inner energy' is their wandless magic. Qing-gong (scaling walls, skipping on water) is much like flying wandless which is a feat that Voldemort and Snape were capable of. (Maybe Voldemort learned it from the Chinese?)

Anything Jin Yong is my jam. I especially love 'Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils'. In that book there is the art of 'Six Pulses Excalibur' which is like a wandless Sectumsempra - invisible cutting spells directed by the hand.
