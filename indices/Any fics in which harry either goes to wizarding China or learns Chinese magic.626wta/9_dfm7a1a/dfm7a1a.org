Completely unfounded ideas to enjoy:

- The Great Wall was made as planned- a barrier to defend the realm from barbarian invaders. The souls of the slave labor who died in its construction and whose bodies fill the deep spaces between bricks also defend the Middle Kingdom from the barbarians, specifically the sorcerers of those tribes who may otherwise have chosen to magically sap those walls.

    Later dynasties used the enchanted aspects of the Wall as their local version of Azkaban. Criminal sorcerers were implanted into the wall for their imprisonment. For the length of their punishment they walked alongside the defender spirits, labouring to rebuild a never-ending segment of the wall.

- The terracotta warriors and surrounding necropolis were constructed so that they could be transported into a Hidden Realm of magic, enabling a sudden presence for the first Emperor and his host to establish a stronghold in the foothills of this fairy land. What was left behind were the shells of their muggle-side presence.

- This is the land sometimes called Shangri La, Xanadu, Nirvana, Hy Breasil, Avalon... the city of clay is only one gateway to this promised land, an unearthly paradise only open to magical beasts and beings.

The Age of Sail and the growth of European imperialism forced the hand of the Asian wizards- many were uninterested in living lives of secrecy and chose to migrate to the Hidden Realm. A substantial drop in Asiatic magicians may have accelerated the success of the invaders, making the lesser portion who had stayed unable to resist the imposition of European Confederacy rule.

In modern times, those few new wizards who arise in the populations from the western edge of the Himalayas all the way to the Pacific coastline are offered the simple choice; stay with the muggles, living an inconsequential life with strict control over when and how magic may be used, or migrate to the Hidden Realm.
