linkffn(The Garden of Intrigue) - Starts well enough and mostly comedic, goes of the rail in the second half when it attempts to be serious. Author managed to keep Draco very Draco despite his friendships, Ron is mostly Ron, Harry is rather different. Completed.

linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) - Or rather it's sequels. Sadly in the first part bad author's decisions in terms of setting, plote etc. outweigh some really good character work and the later parts are ruined by forcing canon-rehashing of plot despite constantly growing changes. Draco differs rather heavily due to the event of the first part of the series, but it's handled well. Ron is ok, though less funny that in canon. And Harry's characterisation is weak point with him being overly wimpy. Ongoing.

linkffn(The Roraring Snake) - Manipulative.Everyone fic. Draco and Ron are rather unwilling in their being friends to each other, but they are connected by Harry. The fic features Manipulative.Dumbledore which should tell you all about faithfulness of characterisation.
