In [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/78824][Earthbound Spook]] Harry, Draco and Ron were bffs in a different multiverse. This fic uses a cool plot device that I haven't really seen before (A Black Comedy kinda uses it)- where there are multiverses and certain spells could send a person from one to another. Draco from another universe where he is a Gryffindor and best friends with Harry and Ron jumps into a mostly canon 7th year universe. The new Draco is really well written as he is very similar to the Draco from canon but his Gryffindor side is heightened. As this is slash, I kept expecting Draco to reveal that he and Harry had been romantically involved in the AU, but they were not exactly... (you'll just have to read it to find out!).
