1.  Action/Adventure, really into stories with a lot of Duelling scenes, and also going into the depths of magic through adventuring.

2.  My favorite characterization is Loner!Harry, my least favorite is Independent!Harry. While some may see them as one in the same, I kind of have to disagree. In Indy!Harry fics, he is constantly around people, he swaps the Golden-Trio for a Platinum Trio, and it all gets very boring. Meanwhile, Loner Harry gives us a more in-depth look into his psyche, and how he thinks.

3.  Harry having common sense. People accepting that Hermione isn't the brightest witch of her age, she just memorizes books. I would also like a more active Dumbledore.

4.  Slytherin, most definitely.

5.  In truth? I don't think he was abused at all, I think in the real story, Dudley didn't even exist and Petunia raised him as she would a son. It was he that could never reciprocate the feeling due to his detachment with the Muggle world. Living without magic after being exposed to it, even for one second, is very hard.

6.  Magical Britain definitely has an above-average magical population, the ministry was supposed to be teeming with wizards, even in the Dark times of the second war. I don't think I could put it in exact numbers, however. I think that the amount of people in Britain is quite alright for such a small country. There should definitely be more throughout the world, if the Daily Prophet would rather front page Harry Potter getting into the Tri-Wizard tournament, world news must be lacking.

7.  I think wizarding culture is okay as is, although the robes are highly unnecessary, most modern mages are viewed as tall and thin, wearing vests or blazers. I doubt that they would make children walk around in heavy cloaks all the time. America would definitely be more industrialized, more technologically reliant, but their line between Dark and Light magic would be just as strong as Britain's. In fact, I think the same would reign true throughout the world, until we get to the African continent. That is, afterall, where the concepts of Voodoo and Black Magic originated from in modern day.

8.  Less, this isn't Japan.

9.  Lie I've Lived had Dumbledore stripped up naked and cut in half, doesn't get more disturbing than that for me.

10. Creature-Wise, it would definitely be huge, Voldemort always had an affinity for dark creatures. But people-wise is definitely the problem, I think that he would still be able to amass a hefty amount of followers, but not as many as before.

11. Classifications? I don't really know, I thought that the X XX XXX classifications were good enough.

12. I have no idea, I guess that was Rowling's poor characterization. I always assumed that he would go Dark in the end. Less bashing, I would rather not have him in the story to be bashed in the first place.

13. The Sherbet Lemons have no real significance, he doesn't really eat them a lot in canon, just offering them at odd times. No, I like to think of Dumbledore as being Asexual, rather than homosexual as Rowling unnecessarily added in her pseudo-character building attempts for the furthering of her liberal agenda.

14. None, the Weasleys aren't those types of people. They have rotten luck with money, but they aren't bad.

15. Less, he would know that Britain needs him, and that a Hogwarts education is better than a Beauxbatons education. While I'm sure they have an excellent charms program, I think they also have unnecessary etiquette classes, or something like that.

16. Not really, he seems more like a gimmick in that story. Not something that should exist in actual canon.
