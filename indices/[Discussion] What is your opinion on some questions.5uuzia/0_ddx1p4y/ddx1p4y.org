Am I easily overwhelmed by long lists of questions?

Yes.

Seriously though, if you want people to answer all these you might want to make an online survey and make some of these multiple choice answers. If you got lots of responses to this that addressed every question (which is probably your ideal scenario) then it's be a nightmare to sort through.

I'll just answer #4 and say that Harry was definitely neglected which is a type of abuse. Also taking a swing at your nephew with a frying pan is never ok and may or may not indicate physical assault happened off scene. Also, emotional abuse is very real and was a part of what Harry experienced.
