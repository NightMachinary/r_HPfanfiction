Far too many questions on too many different topics. Especially because a lot of questions are so open-ended. For the most part, you could post one discussion thread a day until you've gone through all your questions.

Changing a canon character needs clarification. Make canon better while still keeping it canon, e.g. making Arthur Weasley a bit less clueless about muggle stuff? Or change canon significantly, e.g. Snape not hating Harry? Would expanding the role of Ginny or of some empty-name characters (Daphne Greengrass) count as changing a character? Or is this already changing canon?

Most disturbing fic just had a thread a few days ago.

Giving an opinion about the "The Lie I've lived" Sorting Hat would be way easier if you included a description of that Sorting Hat.
