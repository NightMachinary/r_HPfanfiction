- Adventure, AU, Crossover
- Favorite: Canon with a bit more drive in his academics. Least: Indy!Harry at its worst.
- Add more meat to Ginny's character
- Gryffindor
- Heavy psychological abuse, maybe some physical punishment. Definitely severe bullying.
- ~15.000 was a good educated guess I once read. I personally would like there to be ~50.000 to 100k. Worldwide, a few millions.
- The celebration of christian holidays always seemed odd to me. Everything not UK is up to creative worldbuilding.
- There should be way less of that.
- The Real Us
- A few dozen truly loyal Death Eaters, maybe a hundred, or so.
- No opinion.
- He isn't petty, his inferiority complex just runs off with him from time to time. There should be no bashing at all, of any character. Bashing is bad writing.
- He likes sour candy. No.
- *IF* they'd do that, I would imagine them not talking anything as Dumbledore would ask them in such a way.
- Permanently? Less.
- No opinion, haven't read that thing in ages.
