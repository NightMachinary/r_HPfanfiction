  Favorite characterization of Harry? Least favorite?
#+end_quote

i like canon harry but smarter but not too smart for his age and more social(he knows barely anything about his year mates and is on a boarding school, i dislike overly moral and emotional harry( harry in canon used the unforgiveables and kille death eaters without a moment of regret he isn't a saint and surely no golden boy, and harry

  What would you change about any of the characters in canon to make them better?
#+end_quote

I would make Snape more neutral in the class room and more like a reformed death eater should look like , if he wants to look like a spy for Voldemort he is doing the wrong thing, a spy would keep his head down and help the slytherins in private by tutoring and advising them. i would still have him glare and dislike harry but not be so public about it. I would also have him teach dueling or theories of the dark arts as an elective in third year instead of potions a position he seems to hate.

#+begin_quote
  Would you keep Harry in Gryffindor or would you put him in Slytherin?Slytherin, I think slytherin is better for interesting story telling, the inner conflict is interesting when the parents of harrys friends turn to voldemort and they have to make a choice

  What level of abuse do you think Harry saw as a child?
#+end_quote

Enough for people to talk to the Dursleys but not enough to belive harry more than them. He should be getting enough food to not need medical attention but not enoug for him to be as healthy as he could be, he should be occasinally hit but not beaten enoug that he has many bruises or broken bones, the dursleys should ignore him more than insult him. he should be locked in his cupboar and deprived a meal or two for accidental magic

  How many people do you think are in magical Britain in canon? How many do you think should be there? How many do you think should be in the entire world as a whole?
#+end_quote

rowling says there are 3000 wizards and witches in brittian. With the ammount of infrastructure weve seen i would say 100.000 or 200.000 is better but i would spread it to 3 dozen magical villages half a dozen magical towns and 1 or 2 magical cities. I would add additinal magic shools and have hogwarts hold 4200 students that would be 600 for every year and 150 for every house so you have each year 15 new classes of 10 that can have classes with other houses, Of course you would have to add a bunch of staff to hogwarts

  How do you think wizarding culture should be? How would it be different in other countries?
#+end_quote

It should be similar to Victorian era but there should be no sexism or human racism, It shouldn't be a culture stuck in the past but a different one. there should be no discrimination for half blood because they are the majority and muggleborns should be treated with doubt but people who arent blood purist will gladly aknowledge one with power. There was a muggleborn minister of magic in canon and a female one in 1798, so woman shouldnt be treated like cattle that needs their husbands permission to work. I think overall it should be a society that acknowledges power as most important and follows the most powerful. like dumbledore and grindewald

  Should there be or less harem stories with Harry having a 10 foot cock and a few hundred virgins?
#+end_quote

harem is okay if its done well what i havent seen much yet. its okay if its harry having a girlfriend and cheating on her and maybe feeling bad about him (human problems) or if its so he can get political allies. But i dislike it if he is simply collecting woman because of writers wish fulfillment

#+begin_quote
  What is the most disturbing story that you have read?
#+end_quote

A story about harry being raped with a love potion and impregnating Daphne green grass. The author honestly blamed harry and defended himself by saying that Merope Guant raped Tom Riddle Sr. I was really disturbed by the way the author really believed that

#+begin_quote
  How large should Voldemort's forces be?
#+end_quote

at the battle of hogwarts i would say 500-800 dementors, 100-150 werwolves, 200-500 vampires, 10-30 giants, probably 100 goblins( there are probably many goblins who joined him for profit),200-300 wizards under the imperius, 150-200 death eaters, 500-800 regualar thugs that want to earn some money, 100 snatchers, and 100-200 ministry workers loyal to Voldemort

#+begin_quote
  What types of classification for creatures should there be?
#+end_quote

spirits(dementors,ghosts,girmm,boggarts and stuff like that) creatures( anything that isnt cappable of having its own oppinion) beings ( house-elfes, goblins, dwarfes, centaurs. merpeople) i would add a number of 1-10 to show how dangerous they are

#+begin_quote
  Why is Ron such a petty ass? Should there be more or less bashing on him?
#+end_quote

less bashing if he is harrys friend ( the boy is more than ones ready to die for harry and risks his life for him, them having a fight and not talking for a couple of weeks like friend occasinally do doesnt change that. I am ok with a bit of bashing if he and harry never were friends because Ron is a little biased against slytherins and has a temperament and is jealous

  What is the secret behind Dumbledore's lemon drops and does he have sexual relations with Snape over the summer?
#+end_quote

I say the lemon drops are to see if someone trusts him enough to eat something from him and to see if you are hostile to muggle sweets or objets. no to the sexual relation, i my mind dumbledore is chief warlock and Supreme Mugwump and a researcher he doesent have time for any form of nonprofessional relation ship

#+begin_quote
  How much money would the Weasley family take to spy on Harry for Dumbles if?
#+end_quote

A lot the weasleys have ethics and he would have to convince them that its the best for harry, probably by mentioning that voldemort left a piece of himself in harry and he cant know that yeat but someone has to make sure he is well. Honestly i think if Dumbledore spins this right he doesn't have to pay them anything

#+begin_quote
  Would your perfect version of Harry be more or less inclined to move to France?
#+end_quote

Less if he knows about the prophecy and has people he cares about in brittian, more if he only has a hanfull of friends he only knew for a couple months and knows nothing about him being fated to kill voldemort

#+begin_quote
  Would you add in the Sorting Hat character from The Lie I've Lived linkffn(3384712) to your story and/or canon?
#+end_quote

Of course
