Would you keep Harry in Gryffindor or would you put him in Slytherin? No slytherin!harry.

What level of abuse do you think Harry saw as a child? Neglect retconned in book 2 and on, but worse in book 1 before genreshift.

How many people do you think are in magical Britain in canon? How many do you think should be there? How many do you think should be in the entire world as a whole? 1/1000 to 1/777 per muggle population. 1/777 worldwide.

How do you think wizarding culture should be? How would it be different in other countries? Static to how the muggles were there when the statute was signed.

What is the secret behind Dumbledore's lemon drops and does he have sexual relations with Snape over the summer? Two very different questions pinned together. Lemon Sherbet Drops are in fact how he ingests lsd. If he does, it's to reinforce horrible memories for snape to make him have more reasons to not misbehave and get sent to azkaban so he doesn't relive his forced sodomization and a2m and tossing dumbledore's salad.

How much money would the Weasley family take to spy on Harry for Dumbles if? For the greater good bs. Drop it and write a better storyline.
