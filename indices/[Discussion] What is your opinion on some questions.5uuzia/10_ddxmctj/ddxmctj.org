1) depends on how I feel at any given time.

B)I can't think of a favourite. Unlike a lot of people though I actually don't mind am OOC character Harry especially in an AU setting so ling as its explained and makes sense. It has to have a reason for something to have changed.

III) I'll need a clarification in the word better to give you a good answer, ate you asking about more power, to act closer to how I think they should, to make them more how I want?

4) Goes back to my answer for 1) I'm not bothered so long as there is reasoning I can follow. Harry pre sorting was told all bad wizards come from Slytherin and Voldemort was great, terrible but great. When the hat offers him a chance a greatness then he might well have been terrified and not just of sharing dorm room with Malloy. If you want him in Slytherin you need to change what led to that. Simply not having Hagrid randomly appointed to be his guide probably accomplishes that.

V)Over 9000. No idea how to quantify abuse.

F) 100 years (average life expectancy despite wars?) x 40 (rough year size from Harry's year.) =400 total. Clearly too small. Either class sizes where much larger before the war or there are other schools in Britain but Hogwarts is the best or there are several more people in Harry's year that are never mentioned. Slytherin and Gryffindor take some special traits to get into, Hufflepuff will take anyone who wants to work hard and have some friends whereas Ravenclaw will accept anyone who wants to do well in class. Stands to reason there will be massively uneven house sizes to me. Either way we've lost a lot of people in the maths. There should be thousands in Britain but not too many if they all sort of know each other.

7)Wizarding culture will have been shaped by its history of which we know little about meaning we have to go with what we see in the books and try to extrapolate information. Of we set fire to the source and wind back to the medieval because we can god damn it, not because its a good idea by any means but because they can. Oh dear. With regards to other cultures, well they could do but I don't want them to. Why? Because Britain is the home of Hogwarts, the premier school for magic in the world, home of Merlin and the founders. This place is the world leader in magic, I don't need more stories about how USA is the greatest country in the world and how they are so much more progressive and better in every way and Hogwarts is backwards. Frankly those stories sound petty and awful, I've never made it to the end of one.

VIII) with the exception of Noodlehammer's current one most Harem stories can be removed from the fandom with nothing lost.

Losing the will to answer properly so I will just say we have the XXXXX creature rating system for dangerous beasts. After fourth year Harry being invited to go stay with the Delacours in France as a thank you for what he did in the second task is a plot point I want explored more. You can even throw in the strange Veela maturity thing that some fics have and make Gabrielle 13/14 if you want but either way Harry Potter has never had a holiday.
