I like romance/angsty post-battle stuff. I like it because a) the relationships in the series were very important to the development of the characters, especially Harry, yet we don't actually get much about them and b)i think there are a lot of really interesting stories to be told right after the battle and felt Rowling made a mistake not having more of a "Cool down" period right after the battle before flashing forward to 19 years later.

I like a Harry that is a bit more proactive but not some god of knowledge. But I kind of like him in canon so I don't mind if there is no change. I least like a Harry that falls too far into the blaming himself mentality and self-sabotages himself. It's interesting for Harry to feel unworthy of anything good based on his childhood, but reading about him constantly torpedoing the good things in life is too depressing.

I'd have a lot more of Ginny, starting in OOTP but also in HBP and ABSOLUTELY in DH. Ginny is supposed to be an independent fiery character, and is in some cases, but I would have had her challenge Harry more when he breaks it off, and then playing a larger role in DH, or at least have Rowling show her larger role in the leading of the DA. Also would have had her break up with Dean much earlier and show more of the relationship with Harry. The length of her relationship with Dean and not pursuing Harry when she supposedly is a fiery woman who goes after what she wants almost implies she was fine to wind up with Dean and Harry and her came together more out of timing than destiny. I like to believe there was some magic between them.

I keep him in Gryffindor as it better fits his character and I loved the series so why mess with such a fundamental aspect of it. Though him in Slytherin offers plenty of great alternative stories.

The abuse portrayed in the first few books was treated as almost comical, ala a Roald Dahl book, so we were never meant to take it too seriously or realistic. In order to keep it realistic in her world, however, you have to assume there were no beatings. I would argue the mental abuse he suffered was almost worse, but people in general equate abuse with physical altercations. Honestly, I'm not sure about my thoughts on his level abuse.

To effectively keep the separation between wizards and muggles, you can't have too many wizards. Hogwarts is a very small school to take in all kids in the UK. Even factoring in the home schooled kids, I'm guessing not more than low 5 figures. I'm fine with that number. The 100,000 at the World Cup suggests there are perhaps a few million in the whole world. It's tough to make any accurate assumptions as Rowling was all over the place canonically.

How is wizarding culture or how should it be? It's pretty messed up, with the subjugation and separation of certain magical creatures. The whole pureblood ideaology being allowed to permeate culture is really wrong, and it speaks to a culture that is still at least several decades behind muggle society. Then again, women play a more equal role in society, so there are some elements of their culture that is progressive.

Less.

I am self-selecting enough to avoid stories that are overtly disturbing. So I guess stories that involve rape or stories with extreme child abuse on the part of the Dursleys are amongst the most disturbing I read and I really hate when I come across them. Rowling created a world where such things as sexual assault are just not a thing. I firmly believe that.

I think in the Battle, there were around a hundred, right? I imagine there would realistically be many more, as I think wizarding society was open to the idea that purebloods were superior.

Levels of danger, I think you need to treat magical beasts who don't show a legitimate level of intelligence like muggles do. Centaurs are equally intelligent to wizards so they shouldn't be regulated as magical beasts.

Ron is very grey. He has plenty of moments where he stands by Harry and willingly follows him into danger. and then there are those two major moments where he turns his back on him. On a day to day basis, he is often a jerk to Hermione but then also defends her and treats her right. Probably his biggest sin is the way he isolated Ginny her first year. I'm fine with people bashing him but also people who treat him well. Can go both ways, but canonically Ron is a good, albeit flawed, guy.

Eh?

None. The fact that they remain close to him despite the dangers that come with being friends with Harry tells you all you need to know.

Less inclined. Not sure he ever thought about it, but I want the Harry we got, one who fought for what was right.
