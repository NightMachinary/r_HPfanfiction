Ok so let me rephrase that aside from love potions, which are generally viewed in the wizarding world as a joke, but are in fact as you describe, I cannot believe Rowling created a world where it exists. Otherwise that year at Hogwarts under the Carrows is a horror on another level, and I refuse to believe Rowling would allow that to happen.
