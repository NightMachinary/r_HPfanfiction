#+begin_quote
  What is your favorite genre of fics?
#+end_quote

Comedy and fantasy epics (the latter being as sweeping as canon).

#+begin_quote
  Favorite characterization of Harry? Least favorite?
#+end_quote

Favorite: Flawed Harry, with his own issues and problems as he struggles through the world. Least: Super!God!Lord!Hadrian!Potter!Black!Jesus

#+begin_quote
  What would you change about any of the characters in canon to make them better?
#+end_quote

Dumbledore is more proactive in the first couple of books to match his later proactivity in the later books. Ginny is given more than a half-dozen scenes. Voldemort does more evil stuff.

#+begin_quote
  Would you keep Harry in Gryffindor or would you put him in Slytherin?
#+end_quote

Depends. If Harry goes on adventures, it's the former. If he is all about political schemes and whatnot (leaving the adventuring to the more foolhardy folks), like a distaff Cersei, he belongs in the latter.

#+begin_quote
  What level of abuse do you think Harry saw as a child?
#+end_quote

Enough to call Child Protective Services, or whatever the UK equivalent is. Canon Harry I don't think was ever raped or beaten bloody. But he was mistreated. Not starved, no, but mistreated nevertheless.

#+begin_quote
  How many people do you think are in magical Britain in canon? How many do you think should be there? How many do you think should be in the entire world as a whole?
#+end_quote

I'd wager a little more than a 100,000 in canon. To make things a little spicier, I'd add a million to UK, make Diagon Alley a mini-London within London (shrinking charms galore). In the whole world, 100 million.

#+begin_quote
  How do you think wizarding culture should be? How would it be different in other countries?
#+end_quote

Regal and Victorian, given that wizards live for ages (a lot of wizards lived through Queen Victoria's reign). Same goes for other countries.

#+begin_quote
  Should there be or less harem stories with Harry having a 10 foot cock and a few hundred virgins?
#+end_quote

If it's comedy, more. If it's serious, less.

#+begin_quote
  What is the most disturbing story that you have read?
#+end_quote

Princess of the Blacks by Silently Watches. No spoilers, but damn.

#+begin_quote
  How large should Voldemort's forces be?
#+end_quote

About 3'50".

#+begin_quote
  Why is Ron such a petty ass? Should there be more or less bashing on him?
#+end_quote

He's a teenager. Teens are petty. More bashing if it's comedy and crack, less if it's serious. He was a cool dude in canon.

#+begin_quote
  What is the secret behind Dumbledore's lemon drops and does he have sexual relations with Snape over the summer?
#+end_quote

It's Goblin crack, and, no. Snape only loves Harry's dead mom.

#+begin_quote
  How much money would the Weasley family take to spy on Harry for Dumbles if?
#+end_quote

I don't think Dumbledore would make a teenager or gaggle of them into spies. He'd employ less obvious techniques of surveillance, like actual bugs.

#+begin_quote
  Would your perfect version of Harry be more or less inclined to move to France?
#+end_quote

Less. Harry doesn't know French.
