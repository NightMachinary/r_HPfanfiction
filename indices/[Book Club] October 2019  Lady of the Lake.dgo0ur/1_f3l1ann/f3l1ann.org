Well. That was... Interesting. And, as the author's notes mentioned, rather dystopian.

I'm reminded of a statement that I heard from With This Ring, but it might have originally come from Terry Pratchett, that being the "good guys" is not like picking a team jersey, but rather depends on doing certain things and not doing certain others.

I can't respect this Harry, but I'm glad he survived.
