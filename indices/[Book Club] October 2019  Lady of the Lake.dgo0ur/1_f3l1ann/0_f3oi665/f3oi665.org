I asked Colubrina about this fic one time and she said she was trying to write a story where the protagonist becomes the villain, and what she learned is that people who love the protagonist will find excuses or reasons to justify why the protagonist's choices were essentially correct.

Seems like a valuable life lesson, now that I think about it in the current political landscape. Ooh, that's uncomfortable.
