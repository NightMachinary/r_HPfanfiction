Thoroughly enjoyed reading, quality writing. Thanks!

The foreshadowing for what Ron would do made for an anxious read up until that point - I'm not talking about what he himself says in conversation, but things like Draco or Hermione saying "I don't know what I would do if anything happened to him". My only nitpick would be that the the death of their baby didn't come as more of a surprise.
