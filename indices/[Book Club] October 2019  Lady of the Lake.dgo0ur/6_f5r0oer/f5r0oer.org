So, I just finished the first part. I hope I'll manage to finish it all before the month ends. Anyway, I figured I'll write a comment now, and another when I finish it all.

I've seen that most of the discussion here is about "what is good?", So I'll start with the end; Hermione's election speech and the hint that it is based on a famous speech of the 20th century. So... my guess is Hitler. (Before I trigger everyone, let me say that I'm Jewish with European roots, so half my family was murdered.) So, Hitler's speech - he was right. Germany was in shambles, and it was the fault of his predecessors. Not to mention that he did fix their economy (before starting ww2). So, overall, he became a dictator and took care of his people. Can you imagine how history would've remembered him if he didn't start his rampage? As we see only one pov, we can only assume that also Hermione is, indeed, right. Is she a bad person for violently starting a coup? History says "not if she succeeds". They that started the French Revolution aren't "monsters", they that took down Mussolini aren't "murderers" and so forth. Maybe my modern view can't see monarchy as better than democracy - so I'll forgive her for wanting to be a monarch, but only if she really does have the people's best interest at heart. I'm not sure she does. Lastly, and the reason why she's bad: It doesn't have to be a physically violent coup. She didn't have to torture that poor woman, she didn't have to kill (and torture) Ginny.

Sometimes you have to do bad things in order to be good. Yet, being good means doing bad things only when there's no other way.
