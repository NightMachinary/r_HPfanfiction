I thought this was an interesting and enjoyable read, Colubrina really knows how to get readers hooked from the first few chapters! Part 1's trajectory was more or less what I was expecting to read; I was more surprised by the direction of the plot in Part 2. I think the ending had a satisfying conclusion. This fic was structured well with an ensemble cast of characters.

I felt bad for Harry as the story neared the end - glad he and Hermione are in place where they can start to mend what had happened.

I loved the dystopian elements of this fic. One thing I thought could be explained more is why and how the Order got corrupted. It seemed like there was a thirst for revenge against Death Eaters and anything associated with them, but it doesn't completely explain the hedonistic vibe of post-War Order.

The way everyone slowly figured out the rumors about Hermione being pureblood were false was great. Basically everyone accepted the idea that blood wasn't such a big deal (well almost everyone). I like how this is a Dark Hermione story without blood supremacy.

Before reading this, the only fic by the author I had read was Rebuilding. Both featured roughly the same set of characters, but were entirely different in writing style and execution. I liked the action-packed suspenseful nature of this story, and I'll definitely be reading more Colubrina in the future!
