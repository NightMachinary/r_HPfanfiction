"What are you going to do with the Elder Wand, Harry?" Hermione asked, her gaze fixed on the wand in Harry's hand.

"He's going to keep it, of course," laughed Ron. "It's the most powerful wand in the world. He'd have to be barmy to give it up."

Harry stared at the wand for a long moment, then held it up before him. "The first brother wanted this wand to prove he'd beaten Death. Voldemort wanted it... because he coveted the power. Dumbledore wanted to save others from it. But really..."

He conjured a case out of thin air, before reverently placing the wand inside. "...It belongs in a museum."
