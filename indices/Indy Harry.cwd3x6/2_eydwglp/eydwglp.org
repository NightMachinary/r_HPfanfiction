Well, I've written a series where Harry, influenced by Bill, does become a Curse-Breaker and travels the world with Ron and Hermione. And is banned from several magical countries, wanted for stealing artefacts from private collections, and other questionable actions. The first story is mostly focused on Petunia, but also features some of the trio's adventures at Hogwarts and in Egypt, the second shows their search for Atlantis.
