Me too.

I have never read a Draco fanfiction. If it has him as any kind of centerpiece I usually simply do not click on them, because I got burned so hard the first three times I did.

Like, there is many fics that try to explain away that he is at best an arsehole and at worst a racist would-be murderer.

Many authors simply cannot or do not want to write an arc for him that redeems truly. Like maybe with a slight kick in his behind from others, but apart from that on his own.
