I once wrote a small compendium of magical governments for a "Grand Tour" type of fic. It included such things as the still intact wizarding Austro-Hungarian Empire with the "Imperator in absentia" ruling over it. The Sultanat Babylon that is basically a citystate located in the obscured Tower of Babel. Or the theocratic nation surrounding Uagadou which is ruled by Voodoo priests.

For the entirety of France I envisioned something akin to the EU, just smaller. Veela and halfgiants are way more accepted there, it seems. I thought along those lines and imagined magical France to be a union of Veela tribes, Centaur herds, Goblin enclaves and Wizard communities. The central council where nation-wide law is made and enforced lies in Nancy, at the north-side of the quartier magique - the central point of the central magical city of France and the Benelux. I envisioned the Ministry of France to be the government of the wizards, alongside the centaur Elders, the Veela Matriarchs and the Goblin Kings, all ruled by the Council of Nancy as the overlying institution.
