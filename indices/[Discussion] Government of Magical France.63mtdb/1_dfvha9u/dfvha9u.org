I like the idea of magical governments being out of step with 20th century borders and the modern European nation state. So maybe the borders of the French Ministry are not the same as contemporary France. I also have it in my head that Jersey island is some bizarre no-mans land where you can hide from the ministry - not really claimed by either UK or France. It's a fun little way to explain why so-and-so character suddenly transfers in to Hogwarts despite never seeing actual transfers in the books (so maybe HP is already in the Bood of Admittance, but didn't get his letter because he was living in Jersey).
