I envision quite the opposite actually. I would see families like the Malfoy's fleeing France during the revolution as both magical and muggles peoples rebelled and threw off their nobel rulers. That's how a half giant and a half veela became so influential in France: no ancient traditions to make pureblooded wizards the top social class, because all of them were killed or exiled in the early 19th century. I would see France as far more libertine, but at the same time less advanced magically because they got rid of all of the people who knew and understood the most advanced magic as being counter revolutionaries.
