I made up a government system for France/Europe for a story I'm writing that is based on the thought that wizards made treaties which ensure that their borders do not change when muggles change theirs (mostly through war). Therefore magical Europe is a picture of medieval Europe because I can't see magical administration change just because the muggles did. England is a special case due to the independence movements that tore apart the empire.

Spain is divided into the administrative states of Cordoba and Asturias, roughly based on the 1000 borders because they were the first who adopted these treaties. Recently (from the 1994 point of view) they began the unification process but fielded a common Quidditch team since 1953.

France is divided in a dozen substates which meet once every year to make the decisions for all of France. It's a little like the European Union. Each of these states has unique government. The Duchy of Burgundy, which is in the eastern part of France, has a hereditary Veela dynasty. The Duke of Normandy still swears fealty to the British Crown while part of magical France. And the Mayor of Paris is considered Lord Protector of France, which honestly is a representative role without any real power.
