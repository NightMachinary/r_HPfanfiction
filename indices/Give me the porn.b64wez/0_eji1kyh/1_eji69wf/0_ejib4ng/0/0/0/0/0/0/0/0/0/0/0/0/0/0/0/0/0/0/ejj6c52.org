Indeed. Theoretically, the younger you start the "better" your results would be. I have a personal example, not anywhere near as bad as yours but just as valid, involving static shock. When I was younger, for some reason the door knobs at the school I was going to would always shock me when I touched them. This eventually caused me to be hesitant to touch them, and I'd either wait for someone else to do so or I'd have to force myself to do so. This stuck with me for the longest time, and even now I'll occasionally find I have to force myself to touch certain doors, especially if I've recently recieved a static shock. Theoretically, you could do something similar to a younger child, only with something like a shock collar. The human mind is amazingly good at avoiding things it knows hurts (if you need an example try to put your hand in boiling water or something similar, and observe how you'll hesitate) So eventually, you could train them to act exactly how you want. Theoretically.
