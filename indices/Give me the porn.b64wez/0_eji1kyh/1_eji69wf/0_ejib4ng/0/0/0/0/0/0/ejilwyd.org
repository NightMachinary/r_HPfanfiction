The problem is there is no effective way to monitor for grooming nor is there the social or moral infrastructure to set up such monitoring. Ideally, incestuous relationships between consenting adults would be fine.

Additionally, I would not put it as "forbidding incest to prevent grooming." I simply mentioned grooming as an example of an uneven power dynamic.

Adult consensual incestuous relationships are legal in New Jersey, and the laws elsewhere in the US, when they are enforced, are almost always as a result of parent-child relationships.
