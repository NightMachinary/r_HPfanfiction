Why should we assume such a thing has occurred? In regard to siblings, how does this looking up to differentiate from an obsession between a groupie and a rockstar? I would argue that the groupie can still consent to sex even if she believes the rockstar to be a literal deity.

I do admit that grooming is a possibility, but it is also a possibility among any two people given one is at least a decade older. If the slight chance that a babysitter of many years groomed a child is slim enough to pass, then why is the admittedly higher chance of it from a relative suddenly too much? Should we not look at each case on an individual basis?

Further, I don't see why you're bring grooming into this. You may as well be bringing up domestic violence as a reason to stop all relationships. Why are you judging an entire group of people based on the illegal actions that could have been done? In the situation of grooming, then the child obviously can't consent and doesn't belong in the same category as consenting relationships. What issues do you have with consenting relationships?
