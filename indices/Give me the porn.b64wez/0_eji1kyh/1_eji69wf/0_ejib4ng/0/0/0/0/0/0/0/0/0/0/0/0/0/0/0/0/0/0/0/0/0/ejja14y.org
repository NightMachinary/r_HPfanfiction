I see it as possibly being analogous to religious extremism. From the day they are born, they are told what they believe until they eventually are forced believe it by human nature. All up until the day they don't. And religion is slowly but surely dying out. I would actually say it is dead in civilized countries when compared to the "glory" they once held. It's at best an echo of what it was.

But then again, I watched a video of a beheading last night for someone not agreeing with the religion of peace. That's hardly a common occurrence, but it is a sign that things can indeed go wrong.

It was nice talking to you though. If you really want to continue, then it would best be on Discord over a Reddit thread lol.
