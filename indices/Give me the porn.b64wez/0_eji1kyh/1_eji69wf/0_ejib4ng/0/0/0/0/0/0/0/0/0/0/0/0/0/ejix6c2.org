If that is the power difference you are talking about, then that is irrelevant. Even ignoring the child abuse that the word "obey" implies, an eighteen year old is still able to decide what they do with themselves even if they parental figure says otherwise. Heck, the teenage years are nearly synonymous with not doing what your parents tell you. As for respect, respect is something a healthy relationship needs. A relationship without respect is abusive by its very nature. Or do you mean a different form of respect?

Consent isn't just agreeing to it in sexual or medical situations. Consent is an informed, noncoerced agreement. Some sources feel the need to use the "enthusiastic", but that seems to be used in the same context as "not made to" which is why I used noncoerced.
