I see it as the first moment you realize you're stronger than your father. That moment when you have to tilt your head down to see your mother. That's actually why most corporal abuse stops when the subject reaches puberty - they can suddenly fight back and /win/. It's also when they typically gain the ability to report abuse, but that's atypical.

Fear responses diminish every time they aren't needed. Exposure is one of the things that removes or diminishes phobias. If you touch a door knob a few hundred times without being shocked when you expected to be, then you'll generally stop thinking about it. Combine that with the fact that the child realizes they don't have to listen to their parents over a few years... It is an issue that it could happen, but it is an issue that most kids grow out of even if the grooming is for complete control rather than for sexual reasons.

Grooming can also backfire. You might get them to obey you, but they could be a spiteful bitch like me. Even after a decade, I openly ridiculed the poor excuse for a man and all but spat in his face when he got excessive. I may have even done that, I think. Rebellion may be just as likely as obedience. Ironically enough, part of my rebellion was hilariously to not do drugs like the rest of my family. I rebelled by not doing drugs which is hilarious to me when I'm this tired.
