So we should just prevent the child abuse to begin with. I don't see how this is a problem only with incestuous relationships. If it isn't only with incest, then it isn't an issue of incest as much as an issue with humanity in general.

As for humans being trained like animals... No but actually yes. Humans can be trained to react in ways, but those training methods get less effective over time given our very nature. Further, we have methods to recognize and overcome negative training.

Humans are definitely something weird. We evolved like everything else, but the circumstances leading to our survival made us very strange to the point of altering our very evolution. Evolution still affects us now, but it is in a different way than it has in our history. I personally see the future of human evolution to stop entirely. I think the closest thing to evolution we'll be affected by will be the discovery of better processors for our virtual brains to run on.

This reminds me of my favorite examples of humans being humans. Where humans would rather hurt themselves over being bored. They tested it by locking them into a room for a while with only a button that will electrocute them when they press it.

I'll actually be going to bed soon, so I may not respond after a post or two.
