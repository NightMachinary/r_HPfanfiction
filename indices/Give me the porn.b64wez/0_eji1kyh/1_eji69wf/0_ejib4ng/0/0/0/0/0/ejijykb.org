Ah, I had gotten your reply mixed up with someone else who was staying a different stance. Forgive my mistake.

Grooming is indeed an issue, I agree. I just think that preventing those things should be the priority rather than preventing a side effect. Preventing the relationship is just a reason to hide it. As the saying goes, the strict parents raise the best liars. If we taught the children about recognizing and avoiding abuse at an early age, then it would definitely be a good deterrent and catch for such grooming. Forbidding incest to prevent grooming is a bit like forbidding a theif from selling stolen items instead of just forbidding the theft of said items.

I didn't know that not being given food daily or being forbidden to sit on furniture was abuse until many years had passed. Of course, another issue that will be needed is a system to prevent and hold those accountable. Even after learning and telling various authorities, I was still subjected to it for many more years.

I am extremely opposed to child abuse given my background, but I am also extremely opposed to violating human rights such as putting a blanket forbidden stance on incestuous relationships.
