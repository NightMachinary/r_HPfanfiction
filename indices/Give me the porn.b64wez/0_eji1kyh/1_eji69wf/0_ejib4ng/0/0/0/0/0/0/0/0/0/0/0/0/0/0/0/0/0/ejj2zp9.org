It'll happen sooner than you think. Most countries seem to be in a very close to direction to that. The issue I've found is that most Americans assume that America is at least equal if not better than other countries when we're really pretty far behind the more advanced ones in several areas.

I'm a future optimist though, so I have a tendency to see the best in the future. Which is really weird as my opinion on humanity has been incredibly low since I watched that New Zealand video a few days ago.

I am an example of being trained to act in a certain way - to have a blank face. It naturally weakened over time for me with mild effort. It is actually kinda fascinating from an objective standpoint. I won't forget the time my old friend told me that I am scary to talk to though. She said it was just hard to get a read on me which makes sense. I wasn't exactly allowed to show much emotion, so I got pretty good at having a Stone face for that very reason. It is both amusing and sad looking back on it. The training was only from around six to sixteen though, so I imagine it would be far worse if it occurred earlier. I recall an experiment back before ethics where a scientist trained a child to be afraid of mice/rats that persisted for the life even if it was only as an infant.
