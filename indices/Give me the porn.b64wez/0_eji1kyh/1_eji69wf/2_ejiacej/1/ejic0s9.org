Just as incestuous relationships can be filled with rape, the same can be said for regular relationships. As long as all parties are consenting which requires both being of age, then it is no different. If it is indeed rape, then I would vehemently agree that it was horrible. I would even go so far as to agree that there may have been abuse given the power dynamic that previously existed. The issue is that the relationship doesn't require said abuse, and we shouldn't punish someone for the crimes of another. The secondary issue is that we shouldn't assume it is rape until proven otherwise just as we shouldn't assume it with a standard relationship.

Imagine a scenario where Jim and Beth are dating. Beth is 55 while Jim is just the young age of 40. They don't have kids nor do either have any medical issues. The relationship is healthy, consensual, they are too old to procreate, and they are mother and son. If the only part of this scenario that you have issue with is the final part, then there is something irrational going on.
