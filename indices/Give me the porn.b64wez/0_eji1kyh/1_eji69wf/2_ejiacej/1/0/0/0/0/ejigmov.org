I agree that there is a major issue if grooming occurred, but why are you judging a relationship based on what could have happened? I would say grooming prevents the child from consenting, and my point is that a consenting relationship is possible and has no moral basis for being prevented.

Consenting heterosexual relations between two people who have never met until they were each twenty-five has the chance of domestic rape. If there is indeed rape, then we should do everything we can to help. I don't see how it follows that we shouldn't allow it for the simple reason something could be happening.

Why are we using unconsenting relationships that qualify as rape as an argument against consenting relationships?
