We don't, but neither do we know that any standard relationship isn't abusive. If we do find that someone has groomed their child for it, then that is a horribly complicated issue that probably doesn't even permit the person to consent to the relationship. Also, in this example the relationship was described as healthy who would think would say no grooming took place, but your idea of grooming has merit. Do you agree with the relationship if no grooming was performed and Jim was raised to be as functional and mentally healthy as any other child?

I'm not saying that it is completely healthy in every situation. I'm just saying we shouldn't punish the population for the crimes of a subset. Even if ninety percent were abusive, we are still obligated by morality to at least tentatively allow the relationship. I would go after preventing such grooming and child molestation before I went to the extreme of a blanket prevention of such relationships.
