You're ignoring the possible power dynamics at play. If Jim never knew his mother, no problem, but if she raised him then how are we to know she didn't groom him and prepare him for that relationship from before he was an adult? It's more to do with the idea of someone dating someone they helped raise than specifically the parent/child thing.
