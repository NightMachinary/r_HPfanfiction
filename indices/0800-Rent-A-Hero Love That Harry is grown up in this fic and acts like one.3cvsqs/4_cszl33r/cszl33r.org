This... I love it. Never a dull moment, shit going wrong left and right and an awesome as tits Harry somehow muddying through it all as a badass. I haven't felt this happy at reading an HP fanfic since Jamie Evans and Fate's Bitch back when it was still Fate's Bitch (damn you, ff.net political correctness standards!). Bravo Brainthief, you magnificent motherfucker.
