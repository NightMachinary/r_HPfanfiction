Runes are a written language wizards used for a long time, studying them helps you read old books if you dont have the translation. They're also sometimes used as decoration, as we see on the Hogwarts Pensieve. That's pretty much how it was in Canon, and I personally enjoy it much more then what Fanon turned it into, like if Runes were that Power why wouldn't they be mandatory when Herbology is?
