Historically, writing has been seen as a magical act for as long as humans have been doing it. Something like it happens in the Potterverse: books of dark curses bleed and scream, the Monster Book Of Monsters tries to bite the reader, and the chap in Flourish and Blotts complains about not being able to find the book of Invisibility magic.

Potterverse magic is expressed in intent and meaning. Get enough meaning together in one spot that expresses a particular intent, and magic will start to happen, if it's done by someone with enough of a spark. Runes are good for that, since the runes themselves have meaning and intent, the languages they express have no standardised spelling so you can shade the meaning you're expressing with a word by spelling it with different runes, you can get poetic to add layers of meaning with metre and kenning and all the other tricks of the versifier's trade.

Rune-spells, if you've got the time and room to write them out in the proper form with the right paint/ink/carving tools can do anything wand or potion magic can, and sometimes are a better tool for the job than either.

They're /particularly/ good for simple, single purpose permanent enchantments on objects, such as the alu-runes muggle archaeologists keep finding on old artefacts. A simple rune-charm of good luck and good health, it's no threat to secrecy since even if most of the magic hadn't run out after all these centuries, it's so weak and subtle you'd hardly notice it working.
