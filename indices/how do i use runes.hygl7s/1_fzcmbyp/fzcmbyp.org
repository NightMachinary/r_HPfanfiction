I think it partially depends on how real to life you want to be.

There are some stories where its just a language class where you learn old norse (and possibly old english)

There are stories where it is a form of symbolic magic and the runic alphabets are just well suited to it because of the way it is taught ie: rune poems talking about the mysteries of each character. Typically these stories mention that there are similar sigilmantic methods with Egyptian hieroglyphs and Chinese characters. I've yet to see it but in this framework Ogam would also be viable as sigilmantic system.

And then there are stories like linkffn(Harry Potter and the runestone path) where the "runes" are completely disassociated from their real life counterparts and are just vaguely described magical symbols that mean whatever the writer wants them to.

I think its kinda obvious which way i lean, but thats just me and im no writer
