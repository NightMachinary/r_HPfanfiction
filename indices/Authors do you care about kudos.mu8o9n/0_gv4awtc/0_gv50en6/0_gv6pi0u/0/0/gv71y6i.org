I solved that my creating my own Community for the Harry Potter stories I read that were complete, and I liked well enough to add. Of course, my tastes have gotten more refined over the years, so some of the ones in there, I may not consider good enough to add these days, and have removed a few from there upon re-reading. This give me an easy access to all the stories I have enjoyed, plus as a bonus, is open to the public for others to peruse and hopefully find something they enjoy.

I have had my Community for about as long as I have been a member of fanfiction.net, for about 16 years now, and currently have 1126 stories and 93 subscribers. In contrast, my favourites stories list currently has 191 stories in it.
