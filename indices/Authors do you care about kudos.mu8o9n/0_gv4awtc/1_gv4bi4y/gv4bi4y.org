Comments really are like heroine :') I post a new chapter and then immediately have to distract myself, or else I'll end up refreshing my inbox hoping to see that precious (1).

  My real gripe-that-isnt-a-gripe is people who follow my stories on ffn. I only write oneshots, and I put "A Oneshot" in the description and still people follow it. Which, thank you, thank you but there's nothing more for you here! It's done, I don't have the brain to write a proper plot. Please don't follow it, it'll just dissapoint us both. Just favourite and comment and let's leave it there. I'm sorry I can't give you more!!! I know I'm a failure!!! ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

I've only posted a longfic so I can't quite empathize, but I can't imagine the mixture of emotions you must feel XD (also, that paragraph made me laugh and then wince - you're not a failure!!! oneshots are fics too!!!!!)
