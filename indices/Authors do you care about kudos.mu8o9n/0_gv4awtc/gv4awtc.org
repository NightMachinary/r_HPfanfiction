Any recognition at all is just great. Like, it's that vain selfish pride of "yes, they liked my thing!" I'm so goddam needy I need consistent validation it's pathetic.

But kudos is nothing on a comment. Jesus, comments are like heroine! The fact someone took the time to write to me to tell me they liked a thing I did!?? Those people are the best, I love those people they just make my week!!

My real gripe-that-isnt-a-gripe is people who follow my stories on ffn. I only write oneshots, and I put "A Oneshot" in the description and still people follow it. Which, thank you, thank you but there's nothing more for you here! It's done, I don't have the brain to write a proper plot. Please don't follow it, it'll just dissapoint us both. Just favourite and comment and let's leave it there. I'm sorry I can't give you more!!! I know I'm a failure!!! ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
