Haha I love leaving comments on fics! Tbh I think it's the least a reader can do, especially because the author's gone to all this trouble to write a fic /for free/, a detailed comment is like the bare minimum I can do.

My favourite thing is when an author responds to my comment, it makes me so happy! It feels like if a celebrity responded to an Instagram comment lol, I'm always starstruck. It basically guarantees that I'll write a comment for every subsequent update they make. If an author doesn't respond then that's totally fine but I'll generally assume that they're too busy to read the comments so I'll leave it at the one comment.
