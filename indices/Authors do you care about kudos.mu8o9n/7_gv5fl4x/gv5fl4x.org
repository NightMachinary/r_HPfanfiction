I didn't used to, but these days while I still don't put much stock in specifically how much kudos I have collected, it's nice to get the emails that people are reading my stories and enjoying them.

But after being on that sub and seeing people brag about how they stingily save their kudos (like they cost money) for fics that would otherwise win literary prizes, I honestly don't put much stock in whether or not people choose to click that button (or how many comments people leave, especially with the sheer amount of â€˜update please' comments rude people leave lmao)
