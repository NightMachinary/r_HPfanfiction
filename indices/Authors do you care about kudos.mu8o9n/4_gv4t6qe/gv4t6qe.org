Any recognition is cool. I get excited for all of it. Somehow my comment count has always exceeded any kudos or bookmarks i have gotten (I rarely get kudos), which i am grateful for because comments are actual feedback and i try to use them to make improvements or see how the story is being received. There also seems to be no correlation between people who leave kudos vs comments either, I have noticed. Like some of my most consistent commenters have never left kudos, and i have never gotten comments from a lot of users who have left kudos.

IDK, if you like a story, leave something on it. A good chapter can take a few hours to bang out. Authors put a lot of time into their fics dammit go make their week.
