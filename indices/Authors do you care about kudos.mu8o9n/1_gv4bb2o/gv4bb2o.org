I like getting kudos, and I suspect they're generally from people who wouldn't have commented anyway.

What I really love is getting comments that mention specific parts of my fic that they liked or thought was well done.

Seeing the notes people leave in bookmarks is also really nice, and I do enjoy seeing that people are either subscribed to me as an author or to one of my long fics.
