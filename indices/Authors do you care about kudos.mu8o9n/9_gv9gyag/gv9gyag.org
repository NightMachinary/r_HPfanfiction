My friend, when I make a post on reddit I became obsessed with the comments and keep checking in every 5 minutes to see what people thought of my post. I'm sure that with fanfics it would be even worse, I already posted some, and abandoned it precisely because of the lack of comments. Maybe I'm obsessed with knowing that people are enjoying what I do, especially in something I love, like writing, and I see no reason to continue if nobody likes it.
