Thank you for saying that ❤️! I think that when I finish my series and accompanying collection I might turn comments back on, but right now, I don't want anyone to ruin something that I enjoy writing so much. The last time I got trolled, it ruined the whole fandom for me, so I don't want to risk someone doing the same to Harry Potter before I've gotten all my ideas out.
