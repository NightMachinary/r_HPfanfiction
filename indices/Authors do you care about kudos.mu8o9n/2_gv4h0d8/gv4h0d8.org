Comments actually make me incredibly anxious after a nasty situation with a troll, and I disabled them before joining the HP fandom, so I love receiving kudos. I think they encourage more people to read because they're public. I personally always sort by kudos and probably wouldn't read something with less than 100 unless it was recommended by someone I trust, so I definitely pay attention to my hits:kudos ratio and whatnot.

The best (if you don't have comments) are definitely subscriptions, but public bookmarks with flairs added are nice too. Overall, kudos are probably the least exciting type of response, but at least no one can troll me if I say something they disagree with.
