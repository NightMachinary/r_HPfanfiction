Short answer: yes.

It's nice to know that somebody enjoyed your work. I might even go so far as to say I prefer them to comments, because apparently there's a perceived social obligation to reply to every comment and that can be tedious for the ones that are just a generic "liked the story" comment. Unless the reader has a question---I'm always happy to answer questions or expand on a plot point.

I honestly could not tell you whether I have any followers, though I suspect not. I don't actually care about followers. (I mean, I would get a warm fuzzy if I saw somebody followed me, but have no expectation of it and feel no need to try to get followers/subscribers.) I think one of my stories has been bookmarked by somebody, which was quite flattering. I sometimes look at the number of times a story has been read, more to see which stories have a higher read-count because I'm curious more for the ones I've never mentioned on Reddit versus the ones that (very) occasionally match a request.

I do, in fact, check out the profile of those who offer me kudos to see what they've written. I figure if they like my story, I might like theirs as well (if they have any).
