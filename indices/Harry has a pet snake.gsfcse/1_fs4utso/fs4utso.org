Ever heard of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/288212/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Psychic-Serpent][Harry Potter and the Psychic Serpent]]? It's the first story in a trilogy and this fic covers 5th year. It has Harry hanging out with a snake. A lot of smut though, Harry gets smarter and stretches his wings a bit, (but he admittedly allows his hormones to control him), no Dumbledore or Weasley bashing. It's overall a very adult version of Harry Potter.

It's pretty good, but it's long.
