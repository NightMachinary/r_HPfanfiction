Got banned from the site for two weeks for having a different political opinion from someone, and clearly a moderator. When I was banned for "Ad-Hominem" despite literally being called a shit-head, and a retard, for my personal beliefs. I immediately message the site at the 'contact us' link, tell them that they're banning me on no grounds. I get a simple two sentences in response after the two weeks, I didn't reply, simply shrugged and didn't really go on the site after that. I come to find when I type in the site's URL, that I'm permabanned with no reasoning being given. LOL. The funny thing is, I was on the politics section itself, where having a different opinion was supposed to be okay. But if you actively support Trump, you are insta-banned?
