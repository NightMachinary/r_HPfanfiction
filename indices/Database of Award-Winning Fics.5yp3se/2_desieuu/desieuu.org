As someone who has won a few of these fanfic awards I have to admit they did a good job of stroking my ego. But I am well aware that they come from niche sites and so there wasn't a lot of competition, particularly my Mugglenet ones. I do not at all think it means anything more than a compliment. Some of them also came with some really helpful feedback.

I now use them in my summaries to try and attract more traffic because I'm shameless like that.
