I'd agree with your comments about SIYE.

There are certain writers on SIYE that you know will win the award if they have a qualifying story. There were also writers who only wrote stories for challenges and won every time. Most the authors who wrote challenging fics have either moved out of fanfic or moved to other fandoms.
