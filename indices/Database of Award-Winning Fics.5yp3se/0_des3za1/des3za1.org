On SIYE it was a given for years that at least one of the bi-monthly contest awards would be won by one of the mods, who wrote an insipid series of self inserts. And, generally speaking, if you didn't pen their particular brand of fluff (with a couple exceptions), you were frozen out of any awards.

Fanfiction awards are really nothing to put much stock in.
