So, Romione stories are rare enough that you can easily point out the best authors. There's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/8543501/bowtruckles][bowtruckles]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1146256/TMBlue][TMBlue]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4548380/Coyote-Laughing-Softly][Coyote Laughing Softly]]. I'm also fond of the plot-driven Romione story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4327485/1/Renaissance][Renaissance]], though honestly there's not a ton of romance in that and Hermione could have just as easily ended up with one of the writer's OC in the story.

I also just started publishing something that's sort of in the style of bowtruckles --- a missing moments story that feels like the books but that will also take some AU liberties: linkffn(13329796). I think it'll be about 10 chapters long.
