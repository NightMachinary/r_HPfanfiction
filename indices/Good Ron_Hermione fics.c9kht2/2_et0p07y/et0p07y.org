Check out [[/r/HPRomione][r/HPRomione]] to get some recommendations. It's not a super active community but have a sticky with a long list of fics.

As for my personal novel-length favorites:

[[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=191950][After the Summer Ended]] was the first story and published pre-Deathly Hallows. The story centers around Harry, Ron, and Hermione as they Horcrux Hunt. Ron and Hermione get together really early in this fic and while romance it is not the primary plot, their relationship is a crucial part of the story. For a story written before Deathly Hallows was published, I am amazed at how accurate the author's predictions are. Honestly, it's the Deathly Hallows I always wanted because it featured my favorite ship +rather than so many pages on wand lore+. Spoiler>! in this story Ron and Hermione get married super fast which is 100% my headcanon and what I wanted in DH anyway!<

​

[[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=207276][Winter of the Dark Witch]] is the sequel to After the Summer Ended and features the gang all grown up with AU!children heading off to Hogwarts. Ron and Hermione running a pub all the while getting up to the same shenanigans with Auror Potter. Ron and Hermione's son is a major character to this story and he is written like a proper child while adding value to the plot. This story only makes sense if you've read After the Summer Ended and is the most cannon deviant, but an absolute delight.

​

[[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=230148][The Onset of Autumn]] takes place after the Battle of Hogwarts and the year following as Harry, Ron, and Hermione start jobs at the Ministry. Admittedly this is my least favorite of all of the stories. I love all of the Ron/Hermione parts, but the plot feels secondary to the relationship development and honestly, the main plot gets downright confusing at times. There's also time travel which I think is my, personal biggest gripe and caused some timeline issues making the story longer than it strictly needed to be. It does have a proper, well written, in character Draco redemption arc (if you're into that kind of thing).

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/234550][and yes i said yes i will yes (or: four weddings and funeral)]] linkao3(234550) Don't let the title deter you. This is a beautiful story that's more gen than romance. I love how Ron and Hermione are characterized in this story.
