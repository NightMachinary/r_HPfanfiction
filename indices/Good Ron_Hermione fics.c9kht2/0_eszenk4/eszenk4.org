Linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died)

What if the Death Eaters didn't dissolve after Voldemort's fall and continued on as before, just with Malfoy as the new leader?

Skip some time ahead: Malfoy is the +orwellian dictator+ belovenent Minister of Britain, Pureblood supremacy is the law and Hermione and all other muggleborns are kidnapped and raised as brainwashed soldiers. Harry Potter, the Weasleys, Dumbledore and a few other Order members spent the last twenty years in France.

Now, after Ron graduated Beauxbatons, it's time for him to return to Britain as a spy to prepare the coup.
