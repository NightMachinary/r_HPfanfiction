Omg I'm actually genuinely annoyed with myself for forgetting about [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4721967/1/Biscuits-A-Love-Story][Biscuits: A Love Story]]. I love this one!

And I suppose a Ron/Hermione thread can't go without a reference to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7562379/1/Australia][Australia]]. It's one of the best-known Romione fics out there, although I'll be honest it's not my favorite.
