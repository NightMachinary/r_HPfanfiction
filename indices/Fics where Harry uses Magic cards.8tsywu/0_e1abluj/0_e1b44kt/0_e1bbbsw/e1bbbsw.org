I prefer the slow bleed and denial of blue. Oh, you thought you were going to cast something? Oh, no honey. You just put that right into your graveyard. Oh, and your 4/4 flyer is /my/ bitch now. And here's another point from my Prodigal Sorcerer.

I love blue control, red direct damage and white creatures. I used to play the old Microprose computer version endlessly. I still have my ancient Dell from 1999/2000 that has it and every now and then I crank it up.
