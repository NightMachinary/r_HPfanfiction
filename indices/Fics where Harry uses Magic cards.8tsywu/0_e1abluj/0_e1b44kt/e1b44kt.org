What kind of weak ass vintage deck doesn't win turn one with a black lotus? You don't even have to do channel-fireball. Just do some combo like storming off with Tendrils at 12 or something or OOPS ALL SPELLS and kill them with your redic hasted monster.

And now I wish there was Harry the Planeswalker story...
