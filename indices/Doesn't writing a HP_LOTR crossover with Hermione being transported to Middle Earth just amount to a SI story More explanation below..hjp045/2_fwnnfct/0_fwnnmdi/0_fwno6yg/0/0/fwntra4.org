SI still doesn't mean a character with knowledge of the books. It usually means a character with the personality and other traits of the author, with or without knowledge of the books. For example, authors will have a canon character fall in love with a muggle who has a lot in common with the author, except for having never read the books. When people criticize OCs as being thinly-disguised SIs, this is usually what they mean.
