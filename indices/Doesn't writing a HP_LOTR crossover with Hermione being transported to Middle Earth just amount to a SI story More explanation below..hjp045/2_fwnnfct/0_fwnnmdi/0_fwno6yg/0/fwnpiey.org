Note that I said it would /amount to/ because, like the common SI story (note that I say common because some people use this term for all Real World people being thrown into the Potterverse, even though someone wouldn't be able to write the story of a projection of themselves of a world they know nothing about), Hermione would have knowledge about the world she's been transported into and the people living in it because in her homeworld it was a known and acclaimed piece of literature. Therefore, like the common SI, she would try to change the world (Middle Earth in this case) for the better based on her knowledge of the events to come.
