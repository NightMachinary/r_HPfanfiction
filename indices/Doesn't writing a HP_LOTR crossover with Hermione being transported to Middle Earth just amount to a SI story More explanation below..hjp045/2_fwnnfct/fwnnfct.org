A SI doesn't just mean someone who's read the books, it means the author putting themselves in the story. Unless Hermione is writing fanfic, this wouldn't be a self insert.

Of course, there's no assurance that fanfic authors get any particular characterization right. Authors can make a character do what the author would do, not what the canon character would do. Any type of story is susceptible to that issue.
