You should concentrate at school.

However, I understand putting fanfiction first. I was reading hp fanfiction throughout my entire last year of sixth form. Would even read during ALL my classes - exasperated my teachers.

Anyway, a fic I really like and one that you probably haven't read as it is quite niche is linkffn(Hypocrisy) by Sachita. It's a beautiful TMR/Minerva fic.
