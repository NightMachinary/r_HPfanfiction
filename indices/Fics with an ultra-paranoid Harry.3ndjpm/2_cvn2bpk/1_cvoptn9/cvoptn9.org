I really like this series but it seems the author doesn't really like it and doesn't care that much about updating. While read it I saw lots of a/n's like "this will probably be the last one" or "this won't be updated again unless I feel like it". It's really sad because I found it very entertaining to read, with a strong characterization of lazy!harry.
