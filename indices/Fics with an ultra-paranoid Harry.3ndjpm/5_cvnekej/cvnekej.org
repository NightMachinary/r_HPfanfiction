Sadly not novel length, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3427377/1/Harry-gets-Motivated][Harry Gets Motivated]] has imperious induced paranoia in spades.

If someone managed to flesh out that concept into a novel length fic they'd be my hero. It is a pretty good idea, have someone imperious you to study and train hard and enjoy it.

Of course, letting Moody be the one to do it to you is of questionable logic....
