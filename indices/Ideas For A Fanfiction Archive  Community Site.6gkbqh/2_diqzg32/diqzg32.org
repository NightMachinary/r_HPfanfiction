So... You're talking some place where we can link to fics that are hosted elsewhere, maybe with like...a wiki-type section where we review the fics that are linked?

I mean, if you're not trying to actually host the fics themselves, I feel like you could probably use a wiki or an FAQ and just repurpose it slightly. That would also pretty easily take care of having multiple editors.

That said, I might be way off the mark fit what you are thinking. But, if this ever gets into the planning stage, I'd be interested in helping out. I also have a decent grasp of web dev, and I very much learn by doing.
