A way to discuss the story, rather than merely commenting, could be interesting. Maybe some kind of forum (one per fic, for example), directly linked from the fic, or something like that.

Well, it's just an idea, I don't know how something like that would turn out.

Or simply the comments apparent and indented under each chapter, as in a blog.
