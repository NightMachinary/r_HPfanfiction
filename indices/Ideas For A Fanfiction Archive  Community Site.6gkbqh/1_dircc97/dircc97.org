Fanfiction.net would be perfect for me if you could sort out slash fics. If I want a fic where Malfoy and Harry are friends, I'm going to ask here, because fanfiction.net will give me 99% of slash stories. Other things would be interface design; maybe readers could suggest fixing grammar mistakes by highlighting text and only author could see this? Nothing else comes to mind right now. Only that archiveofourown is not what it should look like.
