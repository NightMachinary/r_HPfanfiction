I think I may have mentioned this when I rec'd the story, but Tigerman is French Canadian and English is not his first language, thus a lot of errors pop up (just look at his new one, After Dark, if you need confirmation) though his beta did a hell of a good job for Runemaster (I've seen the original unbeta'd version of chapter 17, and it was a doozy.) And the story is definitely engaging.

As for Percy, I'm just not interested in a canon Percy and never gave myself the time or energy to read it. I thought I could, but I didn't.
