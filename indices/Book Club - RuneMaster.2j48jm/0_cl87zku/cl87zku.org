I thought that it left a lot to be desired from a technical standpoint. There was an awful lot of misspelling, awkward phrasing, odd word choices, etc. However, the story was engaging enough for me to look past it.

I liked the characterization of Percy: aware of the mistakes he'd made, still burdened by them but moving on with his life, and above all not a cardboard cutout bewitched to recite Ministry regulations. So many fics do him a disservice, I think.
