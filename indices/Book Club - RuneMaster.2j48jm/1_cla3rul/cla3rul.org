Regarding the Percy fic:

I liked the characterization of Percy and Audrey, especially Audrey's background. Fits it with canon pretty well.

I did not like the 'crisis moment' plot point though - I found it too contrived! Percy hears that Audrey must be stealing it and believes it immediately??

Also, the misspellings really did me in. "Chalk full of" was really the worst... But I'm picky about proper writing like that!

Overall, not a bad read but certainly not going on my favourites list!

Edit: oh dear, the RuneMaster fic is really full of errors... I don't think I can finish it.
