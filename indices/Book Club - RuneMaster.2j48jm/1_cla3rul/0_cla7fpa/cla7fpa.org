  I did not like the 'crisis moment' plot point though - I found it too contrived! Percy hears that Audrey must be stealing it and believes it immediately??

Percy's confidence and self-image are shot from the events of canon as well as his previous extremely unhealthy relationship. The ex (I can't remember her name) knew how to push those buttons and make him think that he doesn't deserve Audrey, she's too good to be true so she must be using him.
