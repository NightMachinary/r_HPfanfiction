Plus, I always wondering about the Kwik Spells thing - can Squibs actually cheat and do minor magic? What exactly is a Squib? Is it basically a Wizard-born Muggle, or do they still have some kind of magic in their DNA? I.E., could they still use broomsticks? Can they see anti-Muggle bespelled places and things? What if a home was spelled with a notice-me-not, would the kid growing up inside the the house slowly go insane?

So what I'm saying is...is a Squib a muggle, or are they sort of like the equivalent of a learning disabled, or someone missing a chromosome in that they are magically, they are just unable to use it?
