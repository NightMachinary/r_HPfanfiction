Yeah, she breeds kneazle hybrids, because you need a license to own a full blood one. So there's a market for the crossbreeds, because they aren't as aggressive to untrustworthy people. Given Crookshanks tried to eat Pettigrew, I do wonder what full breeds are like!

And Mrs Norris is not a kneazle - she's all cat, which I was very surprised by. Lily and Severus theorized that wizards have a department in the postal system to handle muggle sent mail, after Petunia managed to send Dumbledore a letter....and I don't see them using an owl. I can't find a source, but I had thought they couldn't use owls...
