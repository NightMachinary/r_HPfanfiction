If the author is racist, it usually goes right over my head, and I've got a sixth sense for that stuff - comes with the territory. Since HP, being set where it is, has relatively few characters of colour, there's a lot less opportunity for people to drop the ball. Kinda fortunate and disappointing at the same time, really. That being said, when wizarding cultures from around the world are introduced in fanfics, you can find more than a few gems of ignorance out there.

Misogyny, however... Sometimes you can read a summary and catch a whiff of it. Whether it's a harem fic, or Indy!Harry or even m/m slash (one of several reasons I avoid them), it's harder to hide because of the sheer number of women in the cast. Of course, many of them haven't been fleshed out which gives the main character a license to wear each one like a hat, or throw them away like a chocolate wrapper depending on the author's fancy.

As a side note, are there any slash stories out there where Harry isn't a doormat? Because that's offensive to both his canon character and relationships in general.
