Yeah, I can't remember the name of that fic but I read it recently. That particular scene was funny as hell in my opinion but not because of the sexuality of the characters involved. It would have been just as good if it was some heterosexual men or women doing the death eater pummeling. The author was trying to portray them getting beat up by the opposite of the death eaters but there is no proof in canon that death eaters have prejudice against minority sexual groups. In fact, the whole topic of sexuality is avoided entirely in the series so it feels a bit weird in a fanfic unless the author manages to be consist.
