This goes back to my comment about it being more ignorance than malice. There are a lot of things wrong with the scene in the fic as described (I haven't read it, but based off of what OP said and you said) and your commentary. Transexual does not equal gender-bending does not equal sexuality. The author apparently described men wearing dresses as transexual, which is not correct. Sometimes the term transvestite is used, though that's somewhat problematic, so often times people say gender-bending. Both this and transex have to do with gender identity and gender expression, not sexuality. Sexuality is who you are attracted to, and gender identity is entirely separate from that.

So for someone who hasn't been exposed to this, it doesn't bother you at all, but for someone for whom these issues are important, it /is/ offensive. Just because the author, or some readers, don't understand why, doesn't change the fact that it's hugely problematic. That's why OP stopped reading the fic.
