  Which notable characters are women and not in roles that a 1950s advertisement would be happy with?

...Petunia and Mrs Weasley are the only two who fit that ideal and both seem perfectly fine with it. Nothing wrong with a house wife.

The 3 main characters are straight and they are the only characters we really see relationships of. You could make the same argument about any random attribute that affects 5-10% of the public.

The reason Harry Potter doesn't make a big deal out of minorities is because it created its own in mudbloods and purebloods. The morals and lessons of this "bloodism" can be applied to any prejudice which is /the whole point/. Kids will read it and hopefully see their own prejudices in it and adding specific real-world scenarios into it will only dilute that message.
