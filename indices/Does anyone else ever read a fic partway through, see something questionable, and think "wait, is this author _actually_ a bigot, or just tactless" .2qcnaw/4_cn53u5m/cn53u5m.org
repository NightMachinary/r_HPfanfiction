No. If I go in thinking the author's a bigot and will let some of that bigotry through into the story, I'm usually right. It's probably not intentional, reasoned bigotry, of course, just what they've absorbed from their culture and regurgitated without stopping to think that they're denigrating groups that include real people.

It's partially that JKR made it so easy. Which characters are non-white? Cho Chang, who's got about three scenes. Lee Jordan and Dean Thomas, who are far from important characters -- Dean is another warm body to stock the Gryffindor dorms, and Lee is a hanger-on for the twins until even Rowling forgets about him. The Patil twins; it's easy enough for an author to write around them. Kingsley Shacklebolt is the only notable non-white person, really.

Which notable characters are women and not in roles that a 1950s advertisement would be happy with? Amelia Bones, Hermione Granger, and Minerva McGonagall. Bones is far from the main story, and McGonagall is always beside Albus Dumbledore, with his power overshadowing hers. And overpowered Harrys are all the rage, so Hermione is likely to take a back seat pretty much instantly.

Homosexuality? There are bare hints of it, easily ignored -- the books go into as much detail about Aberforth and his goats. This is one place where fandom does much better than canon on a regular basis, and you can see why -- a lot of people here are all "no slash, eww".
