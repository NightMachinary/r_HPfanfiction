You know what? I missed that in my first read through, but I'm pretty sure there's a chapter where a prank goes wrong in Gryffindor Tower by the Weasley Twins results in white skin and blonde hair? And both Patil twins end up asking to take the failed potion because job opportunities are better, or something similar to that.

Hmm, makes me wonder what else I've just brushed off while reading through various HP fics lol
