But is that bigoted? I mean, we are constantly told how white people are only more successful because they get more opportunities and chances and such, due to racism. If that is indeed the case, is it wrong to consider that SOME people, not all or even most, but some, don't give a damn about the color of their own skin or "pride", and will do anything to ensure they get the better job? Regardless if that involves dressing in a suit, or painting themselves blue for all they care?

Also, it could just be a harmless joke being poked at that same teaching of how racism makes everything better for whitey.
