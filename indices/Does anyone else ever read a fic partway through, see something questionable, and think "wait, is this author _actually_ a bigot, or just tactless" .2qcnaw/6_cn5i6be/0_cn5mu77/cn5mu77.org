  Also, as a non native English speaker I sometimes find the "accents" of other Europeans a bit offensive, and annoying (seriously, it does nothing for immersion and makes the dialogue stilted and awkward, staph)

Sadly, canon does that too, especially in GoF, and it even gets the accents wrong. For example, I am pretty sure that Rowling never bothered to check precisely /how would/ a native speaker of Bulgarian (mis)pronounce Hermione's name. (As far as I can tell, he'd most likely pronounce it as an English speaker would, but it's possible that he would use the Russian variant "Germiona", neither of which sound remotely like what Krum had said in the book.)
