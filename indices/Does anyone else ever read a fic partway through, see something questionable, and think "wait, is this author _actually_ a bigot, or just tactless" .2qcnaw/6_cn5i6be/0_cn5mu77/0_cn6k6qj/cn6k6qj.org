I think what's even worse is canon's depiction of non RP british dialects....they're almost exclusively associated with characters that are depicted as drinkers/uneducated (Hagrid being my main example). This furthers the stigmas attached to such dialects/accents. It's also totally unrealistic that nobody else has a non-standard accent, since this is the UK we're talking amount, where pretty much every other kilometer has a different accent....therefore the use of a non-standard accent only on some characters serves to further depict them as uneducated, working class, or in HP terms, half breeds.
