Oh for fucks sake. That is not what I said. I've no issue with reading slash. I couldn't care less if Harry was gay in the odd fic.

My problem is most of the slash is absolute shit and half the time there's no warning of ridiculously graphic and terribly written sex scenes. It's also overwhelmingly between characters that would never get together and then proceeds to take up the main portion of a story that was previously interesting.

But yes how dare I have an opinion on a type of fanfiction.
