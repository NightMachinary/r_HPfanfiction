I think the warning written in many summaries and author's notes needs to be repeated here.

If you don't like, don't read.

I don't understand why you need to be insulting people and their writing when all you have to do is not click on it? Slash is written because people like writing it and like reading it. It's written For Them, because they don't enjoy reading the kind of fanfics You enjoy reading.

I apologise if I understand wrong, but it sounds uncomfortably like you want slash fanfic to disappear, which is a problem because its continued existence in no way affects you.
