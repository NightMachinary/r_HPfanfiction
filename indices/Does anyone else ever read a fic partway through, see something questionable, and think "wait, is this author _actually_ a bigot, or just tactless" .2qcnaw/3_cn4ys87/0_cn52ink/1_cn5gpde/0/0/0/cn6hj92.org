My point was the majority of slash is written by young, inexperienced teenage girls. It's said better elsewhere ITT but basically slash is generally the collection of every poor relationship trait common to fanon but while an entire sexuality that is woefully misunderstood by the writers and just comes off terrible.

The angsty bit it just because H/D and H/S is the most common cause angst rather than a realistic relationship.

The insults to the OP was because she was incredible rude about anyone who would dare to dislike slash and implied it was homophobic not to like it.
