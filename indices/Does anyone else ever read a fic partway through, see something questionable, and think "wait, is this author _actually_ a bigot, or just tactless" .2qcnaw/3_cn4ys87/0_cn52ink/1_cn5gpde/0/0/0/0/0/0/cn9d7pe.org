I didn't say you shouldn't have an opinion and I didn't say anything about whether or not you have a problem with Harry being gay. I said you sound a lot like you think it shouldn't exist because you don't like it. If that's not the case, then maybe you should hesitate before calling something an "absolute abomination" and "shit".

And yes, there's going to be a lot of terrible writing in fanfiction, because fanfiction is free and written by nonprofessional people who have other things to do. Every genre, including slash, has the I-can't-English fics, the amateur fics, the enjoyable fics, and the absolutely fantastic 'this could be published if only copyright infringement' fics.

You can't dismiss an entire genre based on writing quality because every genre will have vast variation in writing quality. Therefore I f you're dismissing an entire genre, especially in strong terms, it looks like you're doing it based on content, and well, I thought it was an accepted practice to avoid fics with content you don't want to read about?
