It's frustration, mostly, at the loss of opportunity. Demand far outstrips supply in fanfiction, so people treasure any good fics. A fic that falls into the category of "would be good if not for factor X, which renders the fic unreadable" is especially frustrating, like a warm apple pie wafted under your nose... which someone then comes and shits on.
