Lots of people talking about slash in this thread. I think there's a lot of misunderstanding in the fandom as to why people don't like reading slash.

*An objection to slash does not necessarily (and probably in most cases does not) stem from or indicate any homophobia.* The "slash genre" comes with so much extra baggage, additional to the depiction of homosexuality.

For a start, the vast majority of slash fics do not faithfully depict anything like a realistic homosexual relationship. Most slash writers feminise Harry significantly. What they're doing is writing a /heterosexual/ relationship, it just so happens that the "woman" (Harry) happens to have a penis.

Slash fics always describe Harry as "slender" not "thin". They refer to his hair as "locks". They talk about the smoothness of his skin and get adjective-heavy when talking about his eyes. His movements are described as elegant or catlike. I can normally tell within a few paragraphs of reading a slash fic that it's slash, just from the way the writing style and description associate Harry with traditionally feminine qualities.

*Gay men are not women.* To write them in that way is in fact quite insulting to gay men, though you can see why it happens (most slash writers are female).

As if to make matters worse, this feminised Harry almost always has some pretty deep emotional issues (so much slash is also angst or hurt/comfort). Harry is frequently depicted as "strong on the surface, emotional wreck within". Even when slash fics make Harry magically or politically powerful, they still make him emotionally dependent on another person.

It's extremely depressing that the young women writing slash seem to associate emotional weakness with the femininity they give to Harry. It is also fundamentally against my taste. I like reading about a well-adjusted, moderately talented, confident Harry like we get in canon.

There are, of course, simpler reasons why people dislike slash, reasons which are related to the notion of homosexuality. Again, these do not necessary indicate homophobia.

As a reader, I identify myself with a protagonist. That emotional connection is so important to the process of reading, because it's what makes you care about what happens to the character. It's what makes the character feel real. Anything that breaks that feeling of identification will therefore uninvest you from the character, and nothing does this like the character making choices that you would never make. This is why I can't read evil Harry, or rebellious Harry, and it's also a reason why I can't read homosexual Harry.

Also, most fics either ret-con Harry to have been gay all along, or have him turn gay overnight. That's just bad writing.

Finally, slash fics almost always pair Harry with Draco Malfoy, Severus Snape, or Lord Voldemort: his enemies and people well out of his age range. Plus, Snape is ugly. Nobody would ever be romantically attracted to him. Those pairings are as unreadable as Harry/Bellatrix and Harry/Molly.
