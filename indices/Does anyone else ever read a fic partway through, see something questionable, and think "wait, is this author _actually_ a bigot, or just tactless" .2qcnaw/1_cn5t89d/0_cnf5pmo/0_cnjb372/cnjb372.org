As a non-gay man, I like my protagonists to like girls. I like to read about what they do with said girls, from just sweet flirting to sexy times... though there doesn't need to be detail on that last part, since it's rarely written well. And I have no interest in seeing sex scene after sex scene filled with cock. It's a shame, I've seen some fics that looked really promising till the slash showed up, but I just can't enjoy immersing into a character that is so fundamentally different. Very much the same reason I don't read many fem!protagonist stories, the character baseline is just too far to immerse in properly.

Out of curiosity, what's your thoughts on so many fics where gay pairings are just accepted in the wizard world? Do you prefer you protagonists to have to deal with the issues of being gay in a setting that doesn't accept it easily, or do you prefer nobody to even bat an eyelash?

Also, have you noticed an odd occurrence where if a fic has one gay pairing, there's incredibly high odds of being two, and if there's two, high odds of three, and so on, to the point where everyone in the WW is gay except maybe Arthur Weasly?
