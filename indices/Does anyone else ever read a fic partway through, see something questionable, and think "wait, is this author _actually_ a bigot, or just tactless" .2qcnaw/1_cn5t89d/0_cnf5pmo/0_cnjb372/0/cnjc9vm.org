I mostly like things to be somewhat realistic, meaning some adversity but mostly positive or completely neutral towards the gay protagonists. Which, of course, does not happen all that often. As with the "everyone is gay" and "of course men can get pregnant" cliches (as well as some others) most slash fics are a heap of whish fulfilment for the authors. Most of which have no idea what being gay actually means for the people involved. Of course i don't want to see the protagonist destroyed over such a minor personal detail, and building all adversity on something like this is either a character study or bad writing. But so is everything being perfect from the very start. Sadly, most slash fics are simply badly written or (worse) badly written porn.

Your reluctance to read such fics is completely understandable, I myself only read some of the better, cringe-free ones as a guilty pleasure. For the most part I stick to general romance-free stories or the really tame het ones as (like you pointed out) I like to identify with the protagonist. And, sadly, all the girly men, pregnant men, sappy clich√©s and badly written sex scenes actually make that harder for me than a "love you", tame kiss with a girl and scene break.

To answer your first question more completely: The acceptance of the protagonist and his love by their surroundings, as everything in fiction, needs to be balanced with the rest of the story. It is nice if the immediate circle of friends and relatives reacts favourably but for that one person. Or if most people have absolutely no problem but only the opposed people speak up. Or a change of location means a sudden (but temporary) backlash from the people they are now exposed to. Opposition and adversity build character and drama, they make the protagonists and their relationship more believable and stronger, to a point. Mindless fluff where everything is perfect from the get go is annoying in the long run (but sometimes nice for a short while) and extreme opposition may be realistic, depending on where you come from, but when I read fiction I don't want to be pummeled over the head with the adversity that I might face for such a minor thing. Let alone a complete, holocaust-style persecution. Just no /shudder/.

As to the second question, the more whish fulfillment there is, the more gays and less problem there are. To the point of ridiculousness. I once abandoned a fic because it turned out everyone was gay, the women where just some kind of broodmares, Harry was Snape and James' kid (only carried to term by lily) and fell in love on first sight. With draco. Who of course is totally nice, as is his father. That is the kind of thing that is nauseating to me and unreadable to most but someone wrote and published it. And because there is so much less stuff written in the genre (and mostly by women) there isnt the amount of good, well-written stories to overshadow the "of course they are soul-bound and now harry is a male veela/girl with a penis" crap. So yes, I noticed :D
