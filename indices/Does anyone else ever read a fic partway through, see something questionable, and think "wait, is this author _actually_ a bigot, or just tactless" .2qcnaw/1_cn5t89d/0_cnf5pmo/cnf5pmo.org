As a reasonably well-educated grownup gay man I have to concur. While I do sometimes binge read slash for the guilty pleasure of having two male protagonists in love for once I mostly make sure I am in the adventure/humor section and choose something reasonably short because the likelyhood of harry being a girly man or a even something that most resembles a girl with a penis is far lower there. Having an actual gay relationship in a fic is a very nice thing for people who like it (for example the gays :P) but most slash fics appeal more to teenage girls and catlady-types because most 'real' gay relationships are betweeen /men/. That is the whole point of the thing, if i wanted all the things traditionally associated with women plus some anal sex I would get a girlfriend with a strap-on :P
