Love the prompt, love the concept, but the only thing that came to mind was pure crack. Enjoy it if you can!

Voldemort strode through the halls of the ministry searching for his prey. It has been several days since his connection to Potter was gone, snapped, /severed/, and he needed to find out what happened. To that end, he set a trap, made sure Lucius' son overheard some of his plans - all lies, of course - and then it was just a matter of waiting until the boy slipped and Potter found out. That this would put the Malfoys further in debt to him for his mercy was just a bonus.

So here he was, stalking the ministry, taking the risk of exposure in order to ensure his success. His Death Eaters had failed him one too many times, but even aside from that, he couldn't risk them discovering something they shouldn't. He had to do this himself.

Sure enough, he found Potter frantically running through the corridors, blind to the danger ahead. Despite the severity of his task, he couldn't help but smile as he got into character and dropped his disillusionment charm. Melting out of the shadows like some dark wraith, he greeted his child-nemesis with a sibilant hiss.

“Harry, Harry, Harry... did you really think you could stop me? It was I who guided you to this place. You've merely been following the trail of breadcrumbs I'd laid out for you. It's still not too late. Join me and-” was as far as he got before the teenager slammed into him, grabbing onto his robes.

“Thank God you're here! You have to help me!”

Voldemort blinked. This wasn't part of the plan. Looking at him closer he saw that the boy indeed looked wild-eyed and disheveled-er. Yes, he looked significantly more harried than even that meeting in '92, when he was still just a first year. Before he could smite the whelp for his insolence, he heard the /clack-clack-clack/ of heels on the marble floor. Judging by how his eyes bulged, Potter heard it too.

Before he could protest, the boy grabbed the hem of the Dark Lord's robes and scurried between his legs. Voldemort was quite scandalized! Sure, he was a sadist and a psychopath, but he had no desire to explain why he had an underage wizard under his robes. He had /standards/, damn it!

His outrage fled him as he saw the woman that rounded the corner. It was such an uncanny thing, this feeling. Black locks and brown eyes stared at him from a face whose features he felt he should know. As she got closer, he couldn't help but think that if he'd had a sister, this was how she would look.

She met his eyes fearlessly and he felt her rummage through his thoughts. His occlumentic barriers weren't broken or circumvented, they simply let he through /'As if we're the same person.'/ As she explored his mind, he found himself remembering Potter, who was long gone by now, not that Voldemort noticed. He watched her face morph from indifference, to confusion, to curiosity, until finally settling on wide eyed wonder.

As she spoke “It's you-” that wonder quickly morphed into fury the likes of which he'd never seen "-*/you're/* *the one that was inside my boyfriend!"*

Harry ran and couldn't help but wonder at the exceptionally odd day he was having, even by his standards. Having a girl step out of a hole in time and space was strange. Having her immediately profess her undying love for him -- even stranger. And sure, he was /grateful/ when she helped him remove what turned out to be a soul-shard lodged in his skull, even if it was excruciating, but he drew the line when she decided to /recreate/ the phenomenon that put it there. /“We'd be closer than anyone! Our souls forever entwined”/ she'd said. He had no desire to see if he could survive another Killing Curse.

So he ran. And as he ran, he began to think of another blight on his life. Voldemort was always trying to kill the people around him. Maybe, /just this once/, he could let him take care of things. Assuring himself he'd made the right choice, he was so busy running, he never felt the spell impact his back.

Tumbling to the ground, trussed up in conjured rope, he came to just in time to see the Dark Lord sprint past him at a dead run.

“It's you or me, Harry!”

... wanker didn't even look back!
