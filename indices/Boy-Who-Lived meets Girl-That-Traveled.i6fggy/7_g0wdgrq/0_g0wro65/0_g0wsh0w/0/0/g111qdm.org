So, I did a thing. Let me just say, after I got a chance to look at it, posting this is light years out of my comfort zone. I'd still like to know what you think of it, but if you'll now excuse me, I think I'm going to find a nice corner where I can cringe myself to death.

It was another dreary day, in a dreary house, of the dreary life of one Harry James Potter. The war was over and many of his friends were gone. As the final sentence was rendered in the courts and the wizards set to rebuilding, he found he didn't know what to do with himself. The had been over two years ago.

When it happened, Britain celebrated. The people were out in the streets, swept up in the euphoria of knowing a monster was gone from the world, as if they didn't enable his rise to power in the first place. Those that remained, friends and enemies alike, mourned, healed, and tried to get back to their lives. Back to when things were normal.

It was some time before he realized he didn't have that luxury. There were expectations of him, it turned out. His role in the war had elevated him beyond the common people and placed the burden of their safety on his shoulders.

Even beyond that, the conflict had shaped his entire life. He had grown up on Privet Drive because a murderer saw a threat and took his family. He made his first friends on the edge of life and death and for all the relationships he built, there was always the Grim Reaper looming over him.

He'd tried to integrate, share the experience of being finally free of the nightmare, but, to his horror, without it there was barely anything left.

Ginny and him fell apart. They were still good friends, but they quickly realized that they just weren't what each of them needed in a partner right now. Dating after that was a disaster -- everyone was only interested in “/The/ Harry Potter”. Thankfully, his friends were always willing to lend an ear and commiserate. Not that Ron and Hermione had those problems, the lucky gits.

Eventually, he sequestered himself in Grimmauld Place where he could be miserable in peace and didn't have to be a burden on everyone. Here he could remember Sirius and learn more of a family he never knew. And the décor really lent itself to his flourishing depression!

He was clearing out a ritual chamber /'Who knew there was so much upkeep needed for a house that actively tried to kill you?'/ when the room sparked.

That was all the warning he got before, with the sound of thunder, a flash deposited a newcomer in the middle of the room.

His wand was out and he was already checking for viable cover before the light fully died down. In contrast to that the newcomer /'Woman. Beautiful./ */Dangerous!/*/'/ appeared to care not one whit for the situation she was in.

“Who are you?” he said, his voice steady, calm, and commanding, as she finally acknowledged his presence.

Her look made his heart beat faster. Luscious lips, warm brown eyes, and dark tresses on a fair-skinned face made her appear the image of a classical beauty. It also made him more aware of the threat she represented.

Her smile was proud, almost arrogant “Why, if my calculations are correct, I'd very much like to be your wife.”

That settled it. Today was one of those days...

“...What?” He couldn't help the flat question. This was all too surreal. He watched impassively as she adopted a teasing smile and said “Not very eloquent, are you? You're lucky you're handsome, at least.”

Harry just shook his head. He wasn't having this and raised his wand in case he needed to take down the crazy person. “I'll ask again -- who are you? What are you doing here?”

The woman huffed in annoyance “I believe it's customary to introduce oneself before inquiring someone's name. Or are manners taught differently here?” He ignored the criticism and began to scrutinize her instead, peering at her as if his gaze alone could divine all her secrets. Damn, but he wished he'd learned legilimency.

Despite that particular shortcoming, there was much he could tell - she was sure of herself, unafraid, and, most importantly, had no idea who she was speaking with.

“You really don't know who I am, do you?” There was an undisguised sense of wonder in his voice. How long had it been since he was allowed to be /just Harry/? He found himself relaxing as the woman's mood picked up. “You're very well known then?” Her excitement seemed devoid of the worship one would have for a celebrity. If anything, she seemed happy to learn something about him personally. It was decidedly an odd experience for the young man.

“People like to believe they know me,” he said sullenly “though, yes, they do know of me.” He tried not to sound petulant, he really did, but his fame had always been a sore spot, and it hadn't gotten better with time.

She preened at him as if she'd received some great news and gestured grandly as she began her introduction. “It's only right they should! Did you think I'd cut across time and space for some little pissant?! They called me mad! That I shouldn't try this on the word of some two-bit seer!” she was beginning to look more than a little manic at this point, but Harry was all too used to crazy monologues /“'All this for a soulmate? Think of what you have, be reasonable!'/ Idiots!” you could practically taste the contempt in her words “When it was prophesized to me that my equal was in another world I was devastated for a minute, I'll admit, but, like always, I knew what I wanted and let nothing stop me from getting it. I pooled all my resources -- made the grandest ritual anyone'd ever seen! - and jumped through /the Veil of Death/” She looked proud of herself, pausing to let the tension build “And so here I am-” she said with a smoldering look “-and there you are.”

Whatever response she was expecting, Harry storming away wasn't it. “Where are you going?!” she sounded almost distraught as Harry climbed the stairs. His angry shout of “*/Drinking!/*” did nothing to assuage her. He couldn't handle this and if the world wouldn't slow down he'd just make it go away for a bit.

Now in the house proper, the woman cautiously made her way into the kitchen where Harry was sullenly working at a bottle of Ogden's Finest. As he made no effort to stop her, she gingerly took the seat next to him. “I realize it's a bit much,” she carefully began “but do I truly seem so horrible that you'd try to drown yourself in alcohol?”

At first he made no effort to answer, just stared into his, now full, glass. Then, suddenly, he downed the whole thing before refilling it and staring at it once more. It was minutes before he spoke and the contempt in his voice was something fearsome “I lost my parents before I could even remember and had to fight and kill since I was twelve -- /TWELVE!/ - on the ramblings of some third-rate alcoholic. I've done my duty! /Over and over!/ And now you come to me with /another/ prophecy. Is this why I've had to be alone? Why I can't have anything /normal?/ Because /Fate said so/?!”\\
