Nearly twenty years of hurt and disappointment were held in his words. He hadn't meant to blow up like this, but he couldn't stop himself. Everyone had their limits and he'd simply found his.

Breathing heavily, finally regaining some sense of composure, he was about to apologize to the stranger for his outburst, when he felt a gentle hand on his own.

Looking over at her, what he found in her eyes wasn't pity or an appeal to stay strong -- something he often found in various well-wishers -- but compassion, patience, /understanging --/ Everything he'd ever wanted! -- and it was nearly enough to make him break down again.

She spoke softly now. Careful, as if the words could hurt her “It's because you're exceptional.” She turned to face him more fully, willing him to give her his attention “It's because you're more than most people will ever be that they burden you with their problems and why none of them can stay beside you for too long. I've seen it happen.”

“When I was a young girl,” she continued “I had no one. I was different from everyone else. They could tell and never let me forget it.”

As she spoke, he could see her getting lost in her own memories, but continue “When I discovered magic, that other people had magic! I was thrilled! I thought I'd finally have somewhere to belong!”

Her joy at these old memories sounded so familiar as to be painful to him, yet she kept talking.

“But it turned out to be just another disappointment.” she said morosely “For all it's wonder, magic was just another tool and the people wielding it were just as mediocre as their mundane counterparts.”

Her expression shifted to something unpleasant, as she continued “Worse yet, I was their lesser. Because I was born a woman with no pedigree -- an accident of birth - many saw me as beneath their consideration -- just some toy to use and discard once I'd /“ripened”/ to their liking” she said in disgust.

“I wouldn't have that. Not for these cretins!” there was fire in her words now. Some dark passion that drove people and could incinerate them if they failed to control it “So I resolved to be the best I could be” she said harshly. “I grew in knowledge, skill, and power -- did things most feared to even /dream/ of! From being something to toy with, I became a coveted possession and, finally, a figure of /fear/ and /respect./”

Her pride in herself was evident, forged from overcoming life's obstacles and those who would trample on her.

And just like that... it crumbled.

“... and /utterly/ and /hopelessly/ alone...”

She looked weak now, as she looked at him. Vulnerable in a way only someone baring their heart could be. “I don't know what kind of life you've led, though I can tell you've suffered-” she said, her hand brushing over the scars on his /'I must not tell lies'/

“-but I'd like to get to know you. Not because you're some kind of /chosen one/, but because, /just maybe/, neither of us will have to be alone anymore... please?”

The spell was broken and beyond her beauty and majesty, Harry could see someone just as hurt and lost as he was. As she looked at him imploringly, his response was warm, /kind/ “I think I'd like that” something he hadn't felt in a long time.

Life and a spark of mischief came back to her eyes as she asked “And might I have your name?” fluttering her eyelashes coquettishly.

He huffed in amusement at her quick recovery “My name is Harry James Potter. And what happened to introducing yourself first?” he teased back.

Her smile was cheerful and sincere in a way she hadn't shown yet, as she answered:

“I'm Teresa. Teresa Mary Riddle.”
