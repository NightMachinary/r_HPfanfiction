Go ahead! I don't have a profile there or on AO3 so I'd appreciate a link to it, once you have it up. I'm curious what the reception would be, but also kind of dread it, if that makes sense.

Edit: I'm paranoid, so I'd like to clarify some of my intentions with the characterization. Mainly because this portrayal of Teresa fails the Bechdel test /hard/.

For Harry, I was going for a kind of "soldier without a war" vibe. After the events of canon, I couldn't imagine anyone turning out as a well-adjusted /anything/ and Harry, unlike his friends with their loving families, would just go back to an abusive home after every "adventure." They all had it bad - he just had it worse.

For Girldemort I tried to give her some traits of her canon counterpart - lust for power, exceptional skill, and more than a little megalomania and narcissism - just more benign.

So, you end up with someone used to taking what they want, giving "impossible" the finger, but not very socially adept (being surrounded exclusively with assholes and sycophants would do that I imagine). Hence her throwing herself at him. She's got no idea what she's doing, so she just comes on fast and hard.

Thanks for listening to me ramble!
