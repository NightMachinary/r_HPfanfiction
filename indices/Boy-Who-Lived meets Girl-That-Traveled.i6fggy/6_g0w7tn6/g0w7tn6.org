That's an epic prompt.

I adore badass females and female Tom Riddle won't be anything but badass! There are very few femTom x Harry out there, mostly there are femHarry x Voldemort, not that I mind either considering I ship Tomarry pretty hard.

Let's see:

“So you are the Chosen One.” The gorgeous girl that appeared of nowhere said calmly as if she wasn't dusting herself from where she had landed haphazardly in the midst of the dusty ritual room.

Harry had long since abandoned the broom and his wand was out, pointed at her. He had learned by now to roll with the eccentricities life threw at him. Of course that was done with a wand raised in defense. Or offense depending on the outcome.

He scowled, “I haven't been called that since years. Been there, done that. Who are you, what do you need? And most importantly how did you get in here, bypassing the wards?”

“What wizard uses a broom for cleaning?” She looked at him disdainfully.

“A wizard, who prefers muggle methods of cleaning.” He remarked sarcastically, “Now answer my question!”

He felt an eery sense of familiarity from her which was strange since he was pretty sure he had never seen her before.

The girl quirked a perfectly groomed eyebrow, lush lips curving into a smirk, “Good reaction time at least. That's to be expected of my ‘equal' course. And I can sense a lot of magical power from you. The seer was correct.”

“What?” Harry whispered heart thudding.

“Exactly; equal, soulmate whatever you want to call it. Personally I feel soulmate is sentimental drivel. Anyway, you made me put a lot of effort, better appreciate it. I crossed time and dimensions for you, do you even realise how difficult the runic and arithmantic calculations were? That's not even counting the perfect astronomy placement of the planets and the power needed.” She scoffed.

“What?” Harry croaked mind blanking.

“But of course I am the most powerful witch, so it was a minor issue. My name is Teresa Mary Riddle. Now you could at least give me the name of the man who I crossed universes for.” She continued arrogantly, white teeth glinting as he traced her high cheekbones before glancing at her eyes which flashed red.

“WHAT!” Harry Potter let out a bewildered shout.

She cocked her head, “Are you broken?”

“Nevermind, all the better for me. First things first, we need to train that uncouthness out of you.” She sniffed imperiously looking at his wide eyes and dropped jaw.
