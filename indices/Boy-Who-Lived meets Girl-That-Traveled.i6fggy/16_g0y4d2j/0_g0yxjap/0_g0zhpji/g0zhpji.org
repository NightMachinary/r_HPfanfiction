Yeah but the little bit of writing I've seen for this prompt in the thread has her going in search for Harry after Trelawney calls him her 'equal'. So she must be pretty old at that point. Unless she managed to obtain an eternally youthful body?

Also, I can't think of any young actresses/models that have dark black hair and reallt pale skin.
