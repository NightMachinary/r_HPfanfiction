"Say it again, Harry."

"Fine," Harry groused. "I won't touch anything I don't recognise, and I'll stay the hell away from anything that I do recognize. Other than that, I'll clean it up."

"Exactly," Sirius ruffled his hair, "on you go."

Harry grabbed the old fashioned silver broom from Sirius and walked to the old ritual room. The door was very heavy wood, and the torches on both sides of the door dimmed slightly when he approached it, but quickly brightened again.

"And that isn't ominous at all," Harry muttered to himself.

He grabbed the handle and yanked the door, ready to face whatever horrors lay within. The room greeted him with darkness.

"Alright," he sighed, "let's get on with it."

Broom in one hand, sand in the other, he entered the room.

The torches on the walls lit up, bathing the room in a gentle orange light.

Shelves upon shelves were lined up around the walls, filled with various highly specific ingredients in small quantities kept safely inside glass vials. His eyes scanned the room, looking for anything alive, or anything /not/ alive (you never knew with the Blacks).

Finally, he looked down, at the thick layer of dirt coating the whole room.

And he started sweeping.

"Watcha doin'?"

A high pitched "EEEP!" left his mouth before he could clamp it down, the broom dropped from his hand as he turned around, wand aimed at the source of the previous voice.

"Huh?" was his eloquent response.

"A bit dank and dreary for my tastes... but oh well," the girl that stood before him, naked, regarded him curiously, "now just where have I seen you before?"

"Uh..." Harry was discovering his puberty for the very first time.

She finally noticed his eyes staring at her, as she had been busy checking him up, and suddenly realised the problem at hand. "Boys," she sighed.

Harry thought that the girl should keep sighing forever, whoever she was.

A flick of her wand had her covered in standard Hogwarts robes.

His mouth finally closed with an audible snap.

"Tonks?"

"Really? You see a girl naked and the first thing that comes to your mind is a kitchen instrument?" The girl looked up. "Are you sure he's the one?"

Harry's brain rebooted, finally realising the danger of the situation. "Who the hell are you?"

"Hey, that's not the way to greet a lady! Or... it wasn't back in my England. That sure will get weird. Quick check, does the word 'Fuck' mean anything to you?"

"Your England?" Harry's mind was busy catching up. "What does..."

But then Harry stopped.

No it couldn't be. No, no no no.

"Are... are you a time traveller?"

Unexpectedly, the girl started laughing. "Well, you do seem to possess some decent amount of intelligence, I'll give you that."

"No!" Harry shouted, "You're not supposed to mess with time! Hermione warned..."

"Hermione? Could you mean Herman Granger?"

Harry's mind simply gave up and shut down, waiting for the time when the world made sense again.

"Seems like I broke him," she spoke with mild concern, "Huh, would you look at that."

Harry just stood there, looking straight ahead, his eyes diluted.

She sighed. "Stupefy!" He fell where he stood.

"Sorry, but it'll be easier to carry you like this. I see a door. Let's go."
