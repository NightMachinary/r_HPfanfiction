Harry wiped his forehead with the back of his hand and cast a look about the marginally less dusty basement. Cleaning was a pain, but down here, he at least had some calm and quiet.

A gust of frigid wind caused the flames of the gas lamps to dance. He flinched and looked around wildly.

"Sirius?" He laughed nervously. "Are you messing with me?"

Everything was quiet. Just when he began to relax, the wind blew with renewed intensity. Something crackled, and a sharp smell of ozone wafted to his nostrils. The wind rose into a gale, causing him to stagger and shield his face with his sleeve. Then, as quickly as it began, the wind died.

He lowered his sleeve, blinked, then rubbed his eyes. Where before there was only a grimy floor now stood a young woman. Pale-skinned and black-haired, she had the slender build of someone not averse to physical activity. He could see that very well, given that she was starkers.

Her dark eyes scanned the room before focusing on him with unnerving intensity. She opened her mouth as if to speak, but only made a gagging noise. Tilting her head back, she stuffed her fingers down her throat and fished about. Slowly, she pulled out a long yew wand.

"/Bwegh/," she said. "You wouldn't happen to have a handkerchief, would you?"

He gaped.

The woman tapped her foot until sighing and conjuring one with a casual flick of her wand. She dabbed her lips before proceeding to wipe the saliva off her wand. "Standard procedure. Nothing outside the boundaries of the body survives dimensional transfer." She winked at him. "I got very good at stuffing things down my throat."

He gaped.

She frowned a little and glanced down her front thoughtfully. "It was either that or my--"

"I, I get it!" he squeaked, turning away with burning cheeks.

"Finally," the woman said. "I was beginning to fear the inhabitants of your dimension did not use verbal language. So, what do you think?"

He shot her a side-glance. "E-excuse me?"

"About this. Me. I'm gorgeous, right?" She spun around. "I mean, /obviously/, but we're not just talking something vague like standards of beauty here. There's no one more compatible than us in the multiverse--I calculated it arithmantically." She stepped closer and frowned when he retreated. "What's wrong? I'm certain I didn't make any mistakes. Sure, the locator spell wasn't in line with Campbell's Theorem, but Campbell was an old fart who didn't know what he was talking about... My derivative equations proved that..." Her fingers tightened on her wand. "But in case I failed..."

He gulped, not liking her darkening expression at all. "That's not the problem! I don't even know you, and besides--"

"Oh. Where are my manners?" She placed a hand over her chest and smiled proudly. "Teresa Mary Riddle, a pleasure to meet you."

A terrifying realization jolted through Harry's brain. Those aristocratic features. That wand. That /name/.

"Are... are you /Voldemort/?" he choked out, inching backward.

"Where did you hear that?" A flush crept up her cheeks. "It was just a phase--a doodle in my notes--how can you /possibly/ know about it?"

"Er..." Whatever reaction he expected, it wasn't this. An absurd hope welled up inside him. "Are you by chance /not/ interested in taking over the world and immortality and all that?"

She gave him a perplexed look. "Of course I am. Why do you think I'm here? As equals without peer, we'll give rise to a family of the most powerful mages to ever exist. In time, they'll come to dominate the world, and we'll be forever known as their great ancestors." She licked her lips and stalked toward him. "Oh... All this talk got me in the mood. Can we get started right away?"

He stared like a rabbit mesmerized by a snake until a flick of her wand made the buttons of his shirt and trousers pop out. Squeaking, he turned tail and barreled up the stairs. Hexes impacted the walls, making plaster rain on his head, but he somehow reached the ground floor.

"Sirius!" he bellowed at the top of his lungs. "A crazy Voldemort chick from another dimension wants my babies!"

After a moment of silence, Sirius's voice drifted from the kitchen. "Is she hot, though?"

"/Sirius/!"
