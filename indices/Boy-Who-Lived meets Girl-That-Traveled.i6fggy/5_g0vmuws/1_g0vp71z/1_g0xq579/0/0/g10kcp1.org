I must defend all Harriets in fics.

We do not know if there is any such tradition in Evans family, many witches in HP have flower names and it seems to be a Thingâ„¢ in England overall.

The name Harriet has much more sense than the others randomly given to fem Harry considering the meaning of both names derives from germanic /home + power, ruler/ which somehow fits to the plot of the series.
