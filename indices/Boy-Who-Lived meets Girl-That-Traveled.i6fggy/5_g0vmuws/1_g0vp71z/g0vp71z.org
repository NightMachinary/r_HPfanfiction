Probably for the same reason that people like giving fem!Harry Harriet as a first name- it's seen as a feminine version of Harry, just as Mary might seem a version of Marvolo by people. Mary is also just easier than Merope because people don't care enough to do research about Tom's history and don't want to put enough effort into making an anagram.
