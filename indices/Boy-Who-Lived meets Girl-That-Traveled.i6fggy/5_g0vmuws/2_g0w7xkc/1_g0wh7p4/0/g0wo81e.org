Its not really possible. If you keep the Riddle surname then the remaining letters of 'i am lady Voldemort' are "am ay volmot". You can make a first name of Tam or Tammy but neither of those are likely; Tam is a variation on a jewish name and Tammy wasn't used as a name until long after she would've been born.

So beyond me finding using an anagram at all ridiculous let alone of a name you hate, i find it nicer and easier to just keep the same initials. Or you can just do what linkffn(power is control) and linkffn(departure from the Dairy) did and have the Voldemort nomme de guerre be completely unrelated to their actual name
