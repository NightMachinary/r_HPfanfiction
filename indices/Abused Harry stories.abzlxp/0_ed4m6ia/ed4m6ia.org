In Mentordora Tonks by jlluh linkffn(12827481) Tonks treats Harry like her little brother and has a massive impact on his integration in the WW. This leads to him gaining a family and causes untold trouble for Dumbledore. It's really sweet.

Another fic is A Heart So True by Andante825 linkao3(14456334) where Harry gets a pokemon familiar, the Dursleys can't handle it, and he's adopted by the Tonks family. It's lovely.
