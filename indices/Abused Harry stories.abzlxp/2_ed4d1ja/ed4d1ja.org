Got you covered. In "No Longer Alone" Harry gets adopted into the Tonks family after a slightly AU third year (story begins on the last day of that term). Mostly centered around family and friendship, it shows how Harry grows into a family without any "Just call me Mum" the minute he steps in someone's house.

The abuse itself is kept at canon levels since that would be more than enough to inflict lasting psychological damage. At the same time, I tried to capture the canon characterisation of Harry as someone who doesn't become a walking mess but adapts. One or two breakdowns for sure (chapters 3-4 and 13), but overall he is still "functioning".

Most of the bonding/healing happens in chapters 3-6, 8 and 13 while chapters 9-12, 14, and 15 focus more on the friendships.
