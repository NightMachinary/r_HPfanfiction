In my story "Patron", the tournament has four tasks - all with an elemental theme. Between the tasks are competitions for those students who were not chosen as champions - a duelling tournament, a Curse-Breaker competition and a Quidditch competition. All tasks are (or should be) as safe as a professional Quidditch match, and held in magical arenas, with spells allowing the spectators to follow the action easily.
