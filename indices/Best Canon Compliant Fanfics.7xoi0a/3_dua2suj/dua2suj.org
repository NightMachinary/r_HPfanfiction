While no longer canon complaint since CC [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]] 80+ works are nearly all compliant with Books 1-7. Recommend linkffn(5486257) and also following the reading list provided.

linkffn(8078750) by My-Dear-Professor-McGonagall is excellent. Also recommend the Great Deeds:Volume 1-3.

And deep cut to a decade ago linkffn(4367121) by little0bird

These are kinda dark but the authors have tons of mostly competent, mostly canon-compliant, and nearly all complete work.
