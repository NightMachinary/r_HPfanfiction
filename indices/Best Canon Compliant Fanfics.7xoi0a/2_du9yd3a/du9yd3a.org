- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6432055/1/Exile][Exile]] by bennybear is one of my favorites. Basically, what Draco was doing post Hogwarts. linkffn(6432055) Status: Complete

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12181042/1/Order-of-Mercy][Order of Mercy]] by MandyinKC. This features Bill, Fleur, Percy, and Audrey creating their own Underground Railroad. linkffn(12181042) Status: Complete

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5715586/1/Proving-Them-Wrong][Proving Them Wrong]] by GriffinSky. I like stories where Percy ended up helping a lot of people from inside the Ministry. It redeems him as a character and a person. Plus, it makes his involvement in the war a lot more tangible. linkffn(5715586) Status: Complete
