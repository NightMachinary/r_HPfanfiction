As Professor Dumbledore puts in in /Half-Blood Prince/, "Magic... especially /dark/ magic... leaves traces". A skilled Aurologist like Dumbledore could probably have determined that Voldemort had used an Unforgivable on Harry that night, and which one was an easy guess.

Moreover, the Killing Curse /was/ Voldemort's trademark spell. It would have been surprising that he'd use anything /but/ his quintessential weapon when trying to off the Child of Prophecy.

If you consider that info as canon (but it was revealed through the video games, so not everyone does), the wand motion for the Killing Curse is also a lightning-bolt shape, making the connection with Harry's scar obvious.
