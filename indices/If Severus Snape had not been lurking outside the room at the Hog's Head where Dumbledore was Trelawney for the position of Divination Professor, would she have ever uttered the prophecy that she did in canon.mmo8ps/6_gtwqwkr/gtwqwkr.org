Nope, because it wouldn't have come to pass, then. Prophecies are tricky and weird - they rely on the situation they are spoken in in order to come true - but they aren't random; they're the definition of deterministic. If there is no real way for the prophecy to come true (i.e. if the writer doesn't reach into ridiculousness) then ergo it would never be spoken.
