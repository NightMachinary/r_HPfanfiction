I don't think so, maybe prophecies depend on the situation and the people present who will hear it ?

The first one : Was made in the presence of Albus Dumbledore and Severus Snape, 2 people who played a big role in it being fulfilled

The second one : Was made in the presence of Harry, even if he didn't understand it at the time he did play a big role in Wormtail joining his master.
