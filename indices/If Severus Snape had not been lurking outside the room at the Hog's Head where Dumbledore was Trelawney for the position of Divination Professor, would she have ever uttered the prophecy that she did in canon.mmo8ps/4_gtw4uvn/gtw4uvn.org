I think because of the nature of prophecies it would have still been made, but it would have been fulfilled differently.

Like Voldemort could have just decided to target the Potters because they were working against him, and since they fit the parameters of the prophecy Harry would have been marked as his equal without Voldemort having any forewarning.
