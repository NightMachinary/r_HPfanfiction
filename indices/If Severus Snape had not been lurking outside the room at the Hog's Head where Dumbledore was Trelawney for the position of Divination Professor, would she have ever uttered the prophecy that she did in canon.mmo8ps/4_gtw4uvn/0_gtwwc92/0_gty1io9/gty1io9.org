Maybe this is a scenario where Neville ends up as the subject of the prophecy. Although since Snape is still privy to some plans he could still find out Voldemort is planning a raid at the Potter's house only this time they don't have fidelius protection, so he he still begs for her life and/or goes to Dumbledore to help her so she still has the opportunity to sacrifice herself for Harry.
