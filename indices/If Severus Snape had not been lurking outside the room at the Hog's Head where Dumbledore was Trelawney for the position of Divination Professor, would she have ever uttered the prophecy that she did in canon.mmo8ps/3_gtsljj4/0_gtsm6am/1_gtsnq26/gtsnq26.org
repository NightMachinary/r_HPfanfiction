I guess it depends whether the prophecies are completely self-fulfilling and depend on the people hearing them and acting accordingly (whether trying to fulfill them or avoid them) or they are full-proof and one way or the other lead to the prophesied destiny, or if the are 'sentient' enough that they are always given in a way that they might be self-fulfilled.

If the latter, I can imagine Trelawney (or even a different Seer!) might have give in at another time allowing for someone to relay it to Voldemort, or Dumbledore, while acting with the best intentions, would unintentionally cause it to leak/put suspicion on Potters/Longbottoms and cause Voldemort to attack them anyway.

I personally like the interpretation that the prophecies can, in theory, be avoided - but that would essentially require a Seer speaking it to themselves and noone else knowing about it, because the knowledge itself will always cause people to act a bit differently or make a different decision at some point.
