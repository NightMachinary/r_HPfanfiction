I actually have a similar headcanon about how prophecies work. Prophecies are heard by those who have the power to (directly or indirectly) bring about the events they describe. They actually end up being fairly similar to how the closed loops of time turner's work. Seers "see" the future, then give a prophecy to those who will make that future real.
