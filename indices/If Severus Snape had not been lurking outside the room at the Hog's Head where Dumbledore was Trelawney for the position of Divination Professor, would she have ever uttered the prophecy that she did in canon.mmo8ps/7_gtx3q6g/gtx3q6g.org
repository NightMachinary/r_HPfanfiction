Personally, I think it wouldn't have, or at least shouldn't have (the whole "massive chamber filled to the brim with unfulfilled prophecies" thing throws a wrench in this interpretation): I like to think that prophecies in the HP verse work on a "they'll only get made once they're more or less set in stone" basis )(so for instance, if you flip a coin, a prophecy couldn't say whether it would land on heads or tails, but after you've flipped it, it could tell you on which it land/ed/, even if the prophet doesn't know).

By the time Trelawney began the prophecy, Aberforth was (in this interpretation) already en route to discover Snape eavesdropping, he arrived at just the right time for Snape to hear enough to identify the subject, but not in time to warn Voldemort about "mark him as his equal," Snape, a loyal Death Eater, would obviously relay what he'd heard to Voldemort, who was always going to act on the prophecy, see a bit of himself in Harry, and choose him as iys subject because of that. Upon realising that Voldemort intended to go after his old friend's family, Snape would of course beg Voldemort to spare her, Voldemort would agree if only to keep a useful servant happy, Snape naturally wouldn't be stupid enough to rely on /Voldemort/ not murdering a muggleborn when given an opportunity and all the reason in the world, so of course he'd go to Dumbledore for extra insurance, and so on and so forth until Voldemort ultimately dies at his own hand, the final victim of his hubris.
