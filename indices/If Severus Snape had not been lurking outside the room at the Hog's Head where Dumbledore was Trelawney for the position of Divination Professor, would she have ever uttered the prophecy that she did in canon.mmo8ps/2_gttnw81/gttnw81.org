Yes, she would have, because the Hall of Prophecies is full of "dead" prophecies that never came true or whose circumstances were never fulfilled. It is, supposedly, a coincidence that the conditions were correct for Trelawney's prophecy to be carried out. The only real weight the prophecy had on the plot was that Voldemort believed in it. We are told, repeatedly, that like Oedipus, the only reason any part of the prophecy came true is because one of the parties involved in it (Voldemort) took it seriously. Dumbledore, I am pretty sure, even directly uses the term "self-fulfilling prophecy."

What I'm about to say isn't really canon, but it is something that is logical given what we know is canon. A true prophecy seems to definitely be something that CAN happen. A true prophecy will never describe events or scenarios that are impossible. However, just because a true prophecy describes a real and plausible outcome for the future, does not mean that this will definitely be the outcome that occurs. Some prophecies happen because the people involved try to avoid making it happen (like Oedipus). Some prophecies DON'T happen because the people involved try to MAKE it happen. Some prophecies never happen, they just get recorded automatically and sit on a shelf somewhere forever, and whether anyone hears about them or cares does not really matter.

So tl;dr, yes, Trelawney would have given the prophecy irrespective of whether or not Snape was lurking outside the door. The fact that Snape was there was entirely coincidental to the plot. If it had not been him, then it is entirely possible that Voldemort could have learned it from somebody else, like Pettigrew, or that Voldemort could have ended up fulfilling his portion of the predicted sequence of events entirely blind.
