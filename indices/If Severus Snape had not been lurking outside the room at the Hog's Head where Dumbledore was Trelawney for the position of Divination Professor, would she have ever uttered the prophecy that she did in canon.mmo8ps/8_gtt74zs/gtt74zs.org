By the traditional definition of Divination, it refers to art of seeking answers from external forces... be them gods, fate, nature, inner eye, whatever. If we go by the traditional definition, we could assume that fate decided to play a trick on Voldemort and have him send Snape to spy on Dumbledore that very day. Actually my headcanon was that since killing is a great violation of the laws of nature and he had killed so many by then, it was the universe's way of punishing him by having Snape spy on Dumbledore the very day Trelawney's inner eye decided to open but Aberforth showed up in time so that Snape wouldn't hear the whole prophecy. I think that an unexplained divine punishment would be in line with the themes that appear throughout the story.

However since JK never provided any explanation, we cannot really know what she was thinking. But that's the beauty of it... we can make whatever we want out of it.
