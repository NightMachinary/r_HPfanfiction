Causality is an interesting thing when you include fate, isn't it?

If there is a fate, then the prophecy needed to be heard, and as such Snape needed to be there. If he hadn't been there, it would have been uttered in some other context, where someone else could relay the words to Voldemort.

But the way it's presentend in Canon, the entire point of the story is that there is no such thing as fate, only people that believe in it. And hence the prophecy only matters because Voldemort thinks it does. He is utterly free, and could have reigned supreme for all eternity, but for being trapped by his own mind. Using this meta knowledge, it seems likely the prophecy would have been uttered all the same, even if literally no one was around.

And yet: What if fate works such that the very fact that some believe in it, and others don't, is already baked into its inner workings? And what is fate but inevitable events, regardless of /why/ they happen?

The Greeks had a curious definition of fate: The inability to escape your own shadow. They called it Hamartia: What determines your path is not celestial outside forces, but rather your own nature. You can't stop being who you are, and hence Voldemort, despite being free, never had the chance to do anything else than what he did. And likewise Harry, who was similarly free to walk away, was never going to, because his very nature demanded he be the one to kill Voldemort and avenge his parents. And thus are set in motion the events that were not destined by anyone or anything, and also never not going to happen.

I'll leave the rest to your philosophical musings.
