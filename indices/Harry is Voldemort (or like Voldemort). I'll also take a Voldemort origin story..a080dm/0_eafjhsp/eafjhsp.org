The Sarcasm and Slytherin series, starting with linkao3(Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes) has a Harry that unwittingly parallels Voldemort's development, in a way that Dumbledore sees but no one else seems to (which actually makes the manipulative, untrustworthy Dumbledore make sense for once).

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux) has a Harry that's like Voldemort in many ways, because the Horcrux in his head is actively shaping his development, but different in some fundamental ways.
