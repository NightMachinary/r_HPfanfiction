I just remembered some more as well Linkffn(5681042; 5681042; 5403795; 6174426; 5019807) Even though [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/10191925/1][How Fleur Delacour Seduced Me AKA: I'm a Lucky, Lucky Man]] is a pretty smutty story, it is still my absolute favorite for Harry/Fleur. Harry / the narrator just has this perfect dry & sarcastic way of delivering the story. It is just perfect. I love how Fleur is written in this too. I usually don't like Ron that much and even he has his moments in this fic, so if you don't mind some smut, I would very much recommend it.
