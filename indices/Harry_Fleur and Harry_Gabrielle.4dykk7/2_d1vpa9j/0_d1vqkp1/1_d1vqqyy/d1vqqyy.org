Exactly. I find most Harry/Gabrielle stories either change her age or after they "veela bond" she goes through some kind of rapid maturation. I just try and forget about the age difference when I read them. If their both older though, the age difference doesn't bug me. It's like Remus and Tonks but 14 year old Harry with a 7 year old Gabrielle is a bit much. I love Harry/Fleur though. Probably my favorite pairing other than canon.
