I always felt that looking for Harry/Gabrielle is for when you run out of Harry/Fleur fics to read so you look for the younger version. lol. I think I've read everything that others have recommended here. There's also Linkffn(8135514; 7544355; 11287688; 11534019; 4152930; 11446957; 6535391; 9977668; 8358170) There's also [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/][Hope]] by Jeconnais. I have a Harry / Fleur story as well but it's my first Harry Potter fanfiction and I don't think it's that good and its currently on hiatus but you can see it here: Linkffn(11379108)
