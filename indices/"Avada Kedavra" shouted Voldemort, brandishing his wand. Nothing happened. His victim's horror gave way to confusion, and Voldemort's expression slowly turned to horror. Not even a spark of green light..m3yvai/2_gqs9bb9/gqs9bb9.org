It's my headcanon that that's what Dumbledore intended for Voldemort in the first place: using Harry's sacrifice to strip him of any power to harm others. It's consistent with Dumbledore's philosophy that there are worse things you can do to a man than killing him and Harry's threats that he won't be hurting anyone anymore, as well as the revelation that Dumbledore's original plan was for him to die undefeated (thus making the elder wand useless). Imagine Voldemort's frustration when after all the knowledge and power he acquired, he cannot use it to harm anyone. Imagine his humiliation as he is being paraded through the streets as people spit and throw rocks at him. I don't recall which Ottoman sultan had a similar fate and when he saw how much the people truly hated him, he died of a bad heart.

Edit: the sultan in question was Bayzed I and was imprisoned and humiliated in that way by Tamerlane.
