Took a stab at this prompt, haven't really tried doing it before, so I don't know if I did a good job or not.

"Stand aside, you silly girl... stand aside now...", Voldemort hissed to a horrorstruck Lily Potter. Yet, she refused to move. Frustrated, he pointed his wand towards her, and uttered the fatal words, "Avada Kedavra!".

Nothing happened.

Had Voldemort thought for a moment, he may have remembered that he accidentally infused more magic into his promise to one Severus Snape than he intended to. Unfortunately for him, he didn't, and Magic demanded a price for the violated promise.

Voldemort looked at his wand in disbelief, and slashed it towards her, repeating the Killing Curse once again, but was no more successful than the last time. Meanwhile, Lily, who stared at him in stunned silence, unable to believe her luck, or to understand why he seemed unable to kill her, quickly regained her composure. She hadn't defied Voldemort thrice with James by being his housewife, and could very much hold her own if it was necessary, even if she preferred more passive Order tasks in the interest of giving Harry a more stable environment. She gave a brief thought to why Voldemort's magic didn't seem to work -- maybe /he/ had actually managed to do the right thing in his life in the end, if there was anything to Dumbledore and his weird crytic remarks about their supposed spy -- but dismissed it as irrelevant for now, and quickly summoned her wand.

Voldemort, seeing his luck run out, decided to make a run for it. Unfortunately, without magic, he wasn't very successful. And soon got to learn that a vindicative mother whose husband just died and whose child had been threatened to death, was perfectly able to show him what it felt like to experience the role of the Muggle in one of his Muggle raids.
