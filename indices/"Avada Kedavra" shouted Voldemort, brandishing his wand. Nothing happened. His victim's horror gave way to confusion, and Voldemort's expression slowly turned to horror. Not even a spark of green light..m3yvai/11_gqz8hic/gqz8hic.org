I've read at least two where this, or something close, happens. One was an Azkaban!Harry story in which he sucked Voldemort's magic away.

That said, how about:

Voldemort cried out, "Avada Kadavra!" but nothing happened. He looked at his wand.

"Having performance problems, Tom? You know, the muggles have pills for that now."

"My apologies, Harry. I forgot to take the safety off. Avada Kedavra!"
