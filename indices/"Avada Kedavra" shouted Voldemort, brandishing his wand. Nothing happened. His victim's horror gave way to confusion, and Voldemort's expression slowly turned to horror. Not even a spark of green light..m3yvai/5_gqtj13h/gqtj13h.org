This could be used for an interesting interpretation of the scarcrux, perhaps Harry realizes that Voldemort is making him angry through the scar and it occurs to Harry that he can muddle Voldemort's emotions enough that he's incapable of casting spells with an emotional requirement like the Unforgivables. Of course Voldemort could then do the same and prevent Harry from using spells like the Patronus Charm, but that just places them both on the same level of using hogwarts student-level spells that don't require much emotional input, thus marking them as equals and allowing Harry to win a duel against Voldemort who is significantly more experienced in more obscure dark arts that require strong emotions to work.
