Unknown to Voldemort he was standing inside of a ward that Harry had him maneuvered into. It was a special ward that Hermione had set up in advance, knowing that Voldemort would want to make Harry's defeat as public as possible. It was a variation of a Time Out Ward that she had read about in an old copy of Witch's Weekly.

In short, he was being treated as no more than a misbehaving child right before Harry finished him for good.

And then they all lived happily ever after, after fixing the glaring social issues that allowed Voldemort to rise in the first place. Insert non-canon pairings of choice, because can anyone really imagine Ronmione working out for real?
