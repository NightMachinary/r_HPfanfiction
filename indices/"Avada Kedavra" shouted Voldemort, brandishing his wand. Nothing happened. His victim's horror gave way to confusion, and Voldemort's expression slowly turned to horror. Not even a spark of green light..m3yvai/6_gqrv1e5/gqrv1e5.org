The AK spell doesn't check if you /think/ you want the target you /think/ you're aiming at dead. It checks if you /actually/ want the target who's /really/ there dead. Trying to AK someone is a standard test among dark wizards for polyjuice, deception, illusions, and unknown information. Is he trying to target Harry and actually aiming at the horcrux? Is the intended victim a polyjuiced and imperius'd loyal Death Eater? That's yet to be determined. But what we know is that if Voldie understood the situation perfectly, he wouldn't want the spell to succeed. So it doesn't. Intent-based spells are well-behaved like that.
