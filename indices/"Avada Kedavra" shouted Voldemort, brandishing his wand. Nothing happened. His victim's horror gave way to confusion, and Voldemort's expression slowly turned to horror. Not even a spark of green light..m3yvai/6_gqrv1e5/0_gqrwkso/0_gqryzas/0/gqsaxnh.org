This sparks the question whether Voldemort would've been able to make Harry a Horcux to begin with - sure, he /thought/ he wanted to cast the spell at the toddler, but if he understood the situation perfectly, /would/ he have wanted it?

He would have to know the prophecy, and understand that to fullfil the prophecy, he would have to /mark/ his equal - thus, he wouldn't want to mark anyone his equal, in order not to /have/ someone to vanquish him.

And would he have been able to kill Lily? She was the one who doomed him with her death the first time - and if Voldemort understood the sacrificial magic going on, he wouldn't have wanted to activate it - it's what made him a bodiless spirit for over a decade!

Would he have even been able to make horcruxes? Or would he find himself unable, and dive into research to Perfect the technique to have his killing curse work?

Maybe he would've been able to make the first thanks to his basilisk, but then recoil in horror when he discovered trying to kill for Horcux always failed, regret it and start over with his research of Immortality.

Maybe, he would've become a far more terrifying Dark Lord - with all the charm and patience of Tom Riddle, and all the cruelty, power and pseudo-immortality of Lord Voldemort - if not true, irrevocable Immortality to help him terrorize the wizarding world forever.

And where would young Harry come in in such a world?

Would he have still somehow wound up with a sliver of Voldemort's Soul? If so, how?

Would he have thought it appropriate to glorify Voldemort, alongside the rest of the world which never saw the war and never got to fight in it, for this world had long since been claimed by the Dark Lord?

Or would they have fought vehemently, and Harry with them?

If he became a True Immortal and still somehow marked Harry his equal, would Harry be thrown into sudden Immortality? What would the prophecy of the world be?

And if Harry did become immortal, how would he deal with the idea of losing his friends and family? Would he become dark, calculating and selfish, willing to force them into the abyss of sempiternity with him? Or would he try to distance himself from them in order not to be as hurt?

To summarize, I /really/ want to see your comment's prompt come to life and explore all the possibilities.
