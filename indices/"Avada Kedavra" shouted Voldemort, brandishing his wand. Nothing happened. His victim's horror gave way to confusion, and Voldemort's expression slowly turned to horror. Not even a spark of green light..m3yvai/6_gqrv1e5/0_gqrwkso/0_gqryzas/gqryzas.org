1) I know this isn't canon. That's why I posted on the fanfic subreddit. 2) if it were like this in canon, you're wrong about what would happen in that scene. I didn't say anything about giving the killing curse extra ability to route around obstacles, just better choices about whether or not to successfully cast. What would actually happen is that the spell would notice that it's not aimed at Harry, it's aimed at its own caster's final horcrux, and would fail just as surely as if you tried to cast it at your best friend
