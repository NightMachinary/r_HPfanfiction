Voldemort stands there in shock, looking at his wand with utter confusion painted on his face. "/Avada Kedavra/," he says again, but less confidently than before, and still the wand does nothing.

Harry is of course relieved that he hasn't been killed, but he has a look of confusion on his face as well. Bellatrix steps up to Voldemort. "Sir...is there something wrong?" she asks.

"I...I'm sorry. This has never happened before," Voldemort mutters, still astonished.

Now that Harry understands the problem, he smiles and lets out a laugh. "Professor Dumbledore told me this might happen," he says. "Sometimes at a certain age, wizards have a hard time 'readying their wands,' so to speak." Harry continues to laugh, which makes Voldemort angrier.

"/Avada Kedavra!/" he cries again, but still nothing comes out of his wand. Harry starts laughing even harder now.

"This kind of thing happens to Muggles, too," Harry says. "My uncle had to start taking little blue pills to deal with the situation with his 'wand,' so to speak. I can recommend his doctor to you if you'd like." Harry doubles over and laughs even harder. Even Bellatrix lets out some giggles in spite of herself. Voldemort glares at her, and she stifles her laugh.

"Sir, perhaps I could kill the boy in your stead," she says.

"You know that won't work!" Voldemort cries. "The prophecy demands that I be the one to kill him. Do you understand how dangerous it would be if the prophecy were not to be fulfilled? Unspeakable consequences may occur! The very fabric of space and time could be destroyed!"

"Actually," Harry says, straightening up now, "there is still a way for the prophecy to be fulfilled. /Avada Kedavra!/"

A green light flashes, and Voldemort keels over dead. Bellatrix screams and drapes herself over his lifeless corpse.

"I guess my wand can still perform without trouble," Harry says. He walks away with a swagger in his step, fully confident and comfortable in his own abilities. He figures now would be as good a time as any to find Ginny.
