For the "abandonment" moment I blame the horcrux, Ron being hangry, and the horcrux. And Harry a little. Besides, he wanted to come back as soon as he'd left (since he'd removed the horcrux), but couldn't find the tent.

Fun fact: Ron was supposedly the most popular character before the movies were released, and people didn't like Hermione much. JKR said in an interview how she was afraid what the film producers would do to "her darling".
