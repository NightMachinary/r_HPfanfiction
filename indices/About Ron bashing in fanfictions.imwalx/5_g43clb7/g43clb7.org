you are reading my mind and speaking my thoughts!

I think I love fan fiction BECAUSE I'd rather read about Ron than Harry. No hate, I just prefer my favorite Weasley. :)

Actually I must confess that Harry Potter fan fiction - specifically Ron/Hermione romances - was my fanfic gateway drug and is the reason I have lost so many hours of my life on Ao3 ðŸ˜‚
