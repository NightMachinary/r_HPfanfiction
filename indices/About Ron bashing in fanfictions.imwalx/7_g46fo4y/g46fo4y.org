I agree with you that there is far too much exaggerated Ron bashing in fanfic but that doesn't change the fact that he did leave them. And he tried to get Hermione to leave as well...an even more damning act.

And you're doing the same thing toward Harry that you dislike about Ron bashing. Exaggerating Harry's actions to make Ron look better. If you are going to criticize at least be consistent both ways.

Ron leaving was a mistake he made...a mistake he immediately regrets and admits too. But he abandon them...that is canon.
