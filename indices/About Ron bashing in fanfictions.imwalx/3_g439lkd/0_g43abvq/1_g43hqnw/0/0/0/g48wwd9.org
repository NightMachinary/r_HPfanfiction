Oh and they even gave one of HARRY'S best lines to Hermione which makes no sense in context! Or out of it!

When they're in the shack and Harry yells at Lupin that he trusted him and he betrayed him. They made HERMIONE say that to Lupin in the movie, like SHE had any kind of relationship with him whatsoever!!!

SOMEONE had a clear fucking Hermione obsession because that's just ridiculous!
