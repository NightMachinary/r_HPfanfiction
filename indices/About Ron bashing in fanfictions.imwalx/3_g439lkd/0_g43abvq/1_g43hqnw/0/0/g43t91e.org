Just in the the years 1-3:

- 1st year: Only Ron is caught in the Devil Snare, and Hermione saves him while he is yelling and panicking (so yeah pretty different than books).
- 2nd year: Hermione is the one explaning what a mudblood is, because she read it in a book I guess?
- 3rd year: The movie doesn't both mentioning Hermione bad moments (the scene with Lavender's rabbit, or when she went behind Harry's back to have his new broom confiscated), but gives her Ron moment in front of Sirius Black

Also, Ron dry humor doesn't exist in the movies. They murdered the poor boy.
