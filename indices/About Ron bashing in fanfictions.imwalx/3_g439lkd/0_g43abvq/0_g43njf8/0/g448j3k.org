I don't really agree with your opinion, mainly because of Hermione.

Even if we ignore the fact that Ron also has some nice "slice of life" moments (like when him and Harry were messing with there Divination homework in GoF), it doesn't explain why Hermione is not hated because of how she acted in PoA.

Her whole rant on divination while Lavender is griefing her rabbit is a pretty big "social misdemeanors". Not to mention how she went being Harrys back to McGonagall, without even trying to "really" talk with him.

But the worst of all is how she dealt with Scabbers. I don't care that he ended up being a Death Eater, Hermione didn't know abou it. From Ron's (or any other observer) point of view, you have a girl who refuse to control her cat after it made several attempt to kill a pet rat ("/It's a cat, that's what they do/"), and who then has the audacity to deny any responsability when the rat is finally killed, even though all the elements tend to show her cat as the culprit. The closest example I can think in real life is these shitty parents who refuse to admit their "little angel" did any mistakes even though there are videos showing them doing it.Ron basher often flat out ignore Hermione in PoA, or try to justify her actions because "she was stressed because of all her classes". But the point is, PoA Hermione acted like a total bitch, and unlike Ron who had to apologize after every mistake, Hermione never had to deal with any consequences of her actions. She cried a bit in front of Harry, and HE apologized, and Ron also came back somehow to help her even though she never apologized or anything.

I wouldn't care nearly as much about Ron haters if Hermione was held with the same standards.
