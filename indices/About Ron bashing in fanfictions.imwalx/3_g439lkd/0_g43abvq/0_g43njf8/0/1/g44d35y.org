You also have a dude who knows his rat's in danger from a crazy cat that's not under control and does nothing about it. At least get a cage. But yes Hermione was a dumbass for the whole Scabbers debacle.

But Hermione gets her comeuppance in POA, she's absolutely miserable for months because she's ostracised by her friends. Harry wins the Quidditch match against Ravenclaw, goes to talk to Hermione and then Ron starts mocking her to make her cry. She's stressed out and lonely. She absolutely got her punishment for being a dumb 13 year old girl. And considering that the broom was sent by Sirius and that the rat was Pettigrew, it's easy to see why there's sympathy for her.

What punishment does the narrative give Ron though? He's quickly accepted back by Harry in both Book 4 and Book 7. He still hangs out with Dean and Seamus in Book 4, does some quick grovelling and is accepted back into the fold. In Book 7 he ditched Harry and Hermione on their mission to kill the Dark Lord(after telling Harry your family's dead yikes) and what? He gets to hang out in Shell Cottage off camera in reasonable comfort, we have no idea whether he's miserable. Ron having to apologise after “every mistake” is not near what Hermione went through in Book 3.
