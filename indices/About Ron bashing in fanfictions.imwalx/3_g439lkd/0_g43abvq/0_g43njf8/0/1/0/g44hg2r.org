  You also have a dude who knows his rat's in danger from a crazy cat that's not under control and does nothing about it. At least get a cage.

Before being given to Ron, Scabber was Percy's pet, it means that in PoA, it is his 7th year at Hogwarts (as a pet rat) without any incident. Why should Ron take any precaution when, clearly, Crookshanks is the problem? Other cat leave Scabber alone.\\
Anyways, that's not really the point since Ron did take precautions, by either taking Scabber with him (in his pocket) or leaving him in his Dorm Room, a place where Crookshanks is not supposed to go. Also a cage? Yeah I'm sure cats love canned food.

  But Hermione gets her comeuppance in POA, she's absolutely miserable for months because she's ostracised by her friends.

Technically, it's Hermione fault that she managed to fight with the 2 only students in the school that can stand her. Ron could hang out with Seamus and Dean because, even without Harry, he is still a pretty plaisant fellow, and is probably the most popular member of the Trio in the school (at least when Harry is not treated like magical Jesus).

​

Concerning Hermione "Comeuppance", did she really get it? When Ron did some (as you described it) "some quick groweling", he at least had to recognize that he fucked up and apologize. Hermione did nothing of that, if anything, it's Harry that has to be sorry about how he treated her, without talking about the fact that he did it for a pretty clear reason.\\
The punishment is useless in itself if the person can't understand what she did wrong, in order to not do it again.

- As for Ron "fault" (his betrayals as some say) :\\
  Year 4, Harry is at least partially responsible for the situation. Yes Ron kinda fucked up with his inferiority complex, but the situation would not have been that bad if Harry had handled their discussion a bit better. Also, Ron taking a full month to "apologize" does not mean that Harry could not have done it sooner. The night when he talked to Sirius was the perfect opportunity, but he rather decided to send something at his face.\\
  In the end, the whole situation is just Teen being Teen and unable to talk about feeling and shits (and also Rowling needing some drama).
- Year 7. They were hungry, hurt, Horcrux corruption and once again, Harry partly responsible by saying Ron he could fuck off. Also, Ron would have been back minutes later if not for the Snatchers.
