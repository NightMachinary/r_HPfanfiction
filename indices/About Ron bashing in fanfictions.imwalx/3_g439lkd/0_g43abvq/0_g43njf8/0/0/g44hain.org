  Hermione is not hated because of how she acted in PoA.

  I wouldn't care nearly as much about Ron haters if Hermione was held with the same standards.

Are you fucking kidding me, there are Hermione hating threads on this sub all the time, and every Ron thread ultimately devolves into Hermione hating to prop up Ron by comparison. Kinda like your post right now. Hermione is hated on every little bit as much as Ron. There are only more bashing fics for Ron because he's tied to many more setting elements the fandom finds unappealing and plot hooks for a separation, so the bashing fics basically write themselves.
