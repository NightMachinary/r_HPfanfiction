Of course. Harry is not at all immune to JKR's, eh let's call them 'elastic', characterizations.

Many people find the conflict between Harry's desire for normality and relatively lackadaisical attitude extremely at odds with his "saving people thing", and you can see the result in the absolutely massive pile of indy!Harry and op!Harry fics.

Harry is the main character so it's hard to bash him directly, but it's not like I've never read fics in which another character leads the narrative and Harry is painted like a worthless little idiot.
