  People conveniently forget how in third year while Hermione was just scared, Ron, even with his broken leg told Sirius that if he wanted to kill Harry he had to kill them all or something similar.

People here always keep harping about this episode or the first year chess sacrifice (in all the daily pro-Ron threads we have, so much for being a hated character), but I think it's not so much that people conveniently forget about it, as it is a consequence of the series being child lit/YA adventure genre.

What I mean is that stuff like standing up to the perceived enemy and having balls in general is quite literally the minimum requirement to be a primary character in this kind of book (otherwise you just can't fit it in the plot), so it doesn't register as a part of Ron's character, whereas his social misdemeanors are straight up characterization that can't be read as anything else but part of his character.

You may say this is unfair to Ron, and perhaps it is, but ultimately it's JKR's fault: Ron's good qualities only come out during action segments, while his flaws always come out during the slice of life segments.
