  As far as I remember, nobody else even knew about the Horcruxes besides them and 'ole Voldie.

I think Snape knew about them? I doubt he would have been able to do much in the case the Trio died (being hated by everybody from the "Light" side), but he had, at least, the same informations that Dumbledore gave Harry so he could have tried something.

Not the best contigency plan, but it's better than nothing.
