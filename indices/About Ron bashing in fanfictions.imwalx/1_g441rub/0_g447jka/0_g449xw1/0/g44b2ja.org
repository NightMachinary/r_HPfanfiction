I would need to look it up just to be sure, but:

- Snape is the one who treated Dumbledore hand after he tried to use the Ring Horcruxe (I think the ring is still on the table while he is working on it too)
- Snape knew he needed to give the true Gryffindor sword to Harry
- Snape knew Harry had to be "killed" because their "connection" can maintain Voldemort in this world.

None of these informations really make any sense if you don't know about the Horcruxe. And I don't think Snape is the kind of person who would follow strange order without any explanation. So I'm pretty sure he knew everything Dumbledore knew about the Horcruxes.
