Regarding the abandonment thing, you're absolutely right that Harry was a moron. But they're also the only thing standing between an Immortal Racist Dictator and the lives of pretty much everyone they care about.

Even if Harry is a moron (which he absolutely was, the kid has the common sense of a spanner), abandoning the hunt because of that is just idiotic because the stakes are so ridiculously high. The way Rowling had things set up with the Horcruxes, Harry, Hermione, and Ron were literally the only thing that had any chance of stopping Voldemort at all. If they died or their efforts fell apart, the fight is lost. As far as I remember, nobody else even knew about the Horcruxes besides them and 'ole Voldie.

Basically, like most contentious situations in canon, they're all fuckwits who bungle everything they do and nobody is really absolutely 'in the right'. :D
