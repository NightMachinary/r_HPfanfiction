There is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2435531/chapters/5393471][A brother to basilisks]] by Lomonaaeren ! Harry hears something from the chamber of secret in parseltongue and finds a basilisk's egg. I really like this story and it fit your criterias but it is really long and I don't think I have ever finished it
