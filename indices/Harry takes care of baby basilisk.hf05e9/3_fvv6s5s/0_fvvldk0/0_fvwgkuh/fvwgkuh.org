Lomonaaeren is a fantastic author and updates really regularly. Their fics are also on AO3 (which I prefer just because I physically find it easier to read + feel like you can sort/filter things more easily) and they have a ton of completed stories (554!) of varying lengths and lots of different topics/pairings.
