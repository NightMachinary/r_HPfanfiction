I wanted to start listing all the muggleborn girls that aren't Hermione... You know, there really isn't ANY? Hermione is the ONLY muggleborn girl anywhere near Harry's age. With the possible exception of Penelope, but she's not certain.

Does Myrtle count? She's muggleborn... but also dead. So still technically Harry's age?
