I like the idea that Harry takes it as a challenge to be even more like his father than his father. It'd be like Harry making his own version of the Marauders except with more blackjack and hookers.

Instead of a werewolf, they have a hot chick that turns into a catgirl. Instead of letting a traitor in, he adds another hot girl. I can just imagine him trying to talk to the group about how to get with the hot brainy muggleborn in Griffyndor with the group, while Hermione is present.
