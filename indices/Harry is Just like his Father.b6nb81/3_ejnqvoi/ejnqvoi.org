Harry is like James, just without the charisma and talent.

James was someone who would move mountains if it meant helping his friends - and Harry fights a basilisk for his best friend's little sister. He faces Dementors for Sirius, someone he'd hated until half an hour before the dementors attacked. James saved Snape even though he hated Snape - and Harry saves Draco from Fiendfyre, even though he hated Draco.
