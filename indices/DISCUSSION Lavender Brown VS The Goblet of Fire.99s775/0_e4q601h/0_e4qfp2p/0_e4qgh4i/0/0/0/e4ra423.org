Dude, I only ever read Make a Wish a long long time ago. I remember laughing out loud at the absurdity of it all. Never knew it had sequels. Have you tagged the correct part two here? Do I absolutely need to read it all in order? I don't remember the end of first part, do I need to know anything before I begin part 3? Thanks very much.
