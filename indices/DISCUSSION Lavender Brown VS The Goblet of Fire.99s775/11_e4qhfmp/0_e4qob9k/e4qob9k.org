Crouch summons 'potter signature' and gets a torn piece of parchment where the said character was practicing writing their possible future name. Eg. Susan Potter. Fic can then becomes a trope bender by having a the questions asked. Does the ministry accept that Susan is now mrs Potter. If Harry is the last Potter, are they married? Are they now accepted as adults? Add a lordship trope? Aunt Amelia is now involved and is ? (Pansy parkinson tried it in first year? And the page is ripped from her diary?)

Going crackfic. Crouch summons a pile of parchment. Thinking why add one signature when you can add many, he rips the names from the pile and drops them into the goblet. Now the harem fic occurs as ALL THE GIRLS/BOYS with or without harry is entered. Harry basically starts up the DA a year early. Subvert tropes now!
