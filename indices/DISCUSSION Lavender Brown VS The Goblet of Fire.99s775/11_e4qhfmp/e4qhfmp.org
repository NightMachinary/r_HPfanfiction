I like your idea of the Goblet choosing someone besides Harry but Harry feeling responsible somehow and helping them. I also like the idea of it turning into a pairing for Harry. However, I am not in love with the idea of it being Lavender Brown.

Just saying, I would rather see other "underdeveloped character" possibilities such as Katie Bell, Susan Bones, Hannah Abbott, Astoria/Daphne Greengrass, or others. Lavender is just so... unlikeable to me. But maybe thats just me.
