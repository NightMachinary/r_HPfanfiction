I'd read anything that features HarryxAnyoneButHermioneGinnyDaphne because I'm tired of reading the same shit over and over again. I find Lavender as a love interest quite amusing and I think it has the potential for being absolutely hilarious without actually needing to force it, like Lavender pampering Harry and him deciding to go with the flow, only to end up with him getting called "Harry Bear" in front of everyone.

I'd certainly read it, and I've been meaning to write a HarryxLavender fanfic too, but uni really tires me too much.
