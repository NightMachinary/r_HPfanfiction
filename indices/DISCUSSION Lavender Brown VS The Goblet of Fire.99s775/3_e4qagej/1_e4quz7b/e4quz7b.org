You know, I started writing a Harry/Lavender oneshot yesterday (technically today at 1 am) because of the same sentiment. I totally see Lavender wearing the pants in that relationship and Harry just goes along with the flow, actually enjoying being pampered and having someone else at the helm for a change. Besides , it doesn't take much to wrap a teenage boy around your finger.

I'd love to include "Harry Bear" if you don't mind.
