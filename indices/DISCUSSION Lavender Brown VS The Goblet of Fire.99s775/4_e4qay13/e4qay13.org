Find some way to absolutely make it Harry's fault.

Like, i think a theory is that fake moody tore Harry's signature off one of his assignments and used it to enter him into the goblet.

so maybe harry was sick of DADA and bribed lavender to copy one of her papers for him. the goblet changes the magically changed harry potter signature back to the lavender brown signature and thats what comes out of the goblet.
