Oooh interesting! I like that theory a lot. Surprisingly, I was just thinking if dementors tonight and saw your post. Dementors sucking the magic makes a lot of more sense. Especially when fanlore has magic being (basically) the lifeblood of wizards and witches. When they lose their magic, they start dying. In fanfics at least.

I was just thinkig tonight, why didnt they have a dementor kiss the horcruxes from Harry and the objects? Was it just too risky? Or maybe that isn't a plausible solution because when a dementor gives their kiss, they take the soul and hold it hostage in their own beings? So then voldemort would then never be able to become mortal?

Honestly those I've theorized on anything in HP lol
