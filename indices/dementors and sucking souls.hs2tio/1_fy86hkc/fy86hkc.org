The dementor's kiss does indeed leave the person brain dead, and no, you don't recover from that, you can recover from a normal coma though. And not all soul magic is considered evil, the Fidelius charm is actually soul magic, it hides a secret within the soul of the secret keeper. And the only dark magic that is considered illegal as far as we know is the killing curse, the cuiciatus and the imperius, and even those have been legalized two times (for Auror use in the first war and during Voldemort reign in the second war).

Not sure about the other implications of your theory.
