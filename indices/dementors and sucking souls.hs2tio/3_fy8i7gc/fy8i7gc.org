Could you please move this question in the Harry Potter sub-reddit? This question is related to a generalized discussion centered around the Harry Potter universe. However, this is the Harry Potter /fanfiction/ sub-reddit. Therefore, it would be preferable if questions in this sub-reddit are exclusively connected to fanfiction.

I am not trying to police but the thing is that I found another question in this fanfiction sub-reddit in which someone complained about Hermione's characterization in fanfics. Those responding to it used it as an opportunity to bash book Hermione right, left, and centre over the fact that she regurgitates answers, and some even said they would enjoy seeing her meltdown in case she failed an assignment!ðŸ¤¦ It was as if everyone was venting out their frustration of movie Hermione and fanfic Hermione's characterization over book Hermione!! I am not joking.

Movie characterization is improper and everyone starts bashing the book characters!ðŸ¤¦ðŸ¤¦ðŸ¤¦

Basically, this fandom is unable to distinguish between book canon, movie characterization, and fanfics.

Therefore, to keep things in order, it would be preferable if this discussion were to be shifted to the Harry Potter sub-reddit - [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/]]
