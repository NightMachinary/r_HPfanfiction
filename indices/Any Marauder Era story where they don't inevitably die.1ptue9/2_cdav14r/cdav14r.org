How about a Marauder era AU fic that doesn't focus on the Marauders?

This one is a firmly AU Snape/Lily fic where Snape turns against Mulciber and his other Slytherin friends when they play a 'prank' on Lily (in canon they do this to Mary Macdonald and Snape laughs it off). The first half is a gradual, believable Snape/Lily romance and Snape making friends outside his house and turning away from Death Eaterdom. The second half is a great depiction of the first wizarding war against Voldemort. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4026081/1/The-Wrath-of-the-Half-Blood-Prince]]
