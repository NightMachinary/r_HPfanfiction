  The phoenix is a gentle creature that has never been known to kill and eats only herbs. Like the Diricawl (see page 9), it can disappear and reappear at will. Phoenix song is magical; it is reputed to increase the courage of the pure of heart and to strike fear into the hearts of the impure.

Excerpt from Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (the book).

I would say they are creatures of 'Light' from this description. Inherently good, they never kill, and are symbols of purity of heart at the very least. Very 'Light-based' traits.

As for Voldemort, here is an excerpt from Pottermore about phoenix feather cores:

#+begin_quote
  Phoenix feather wands are always the pickiest when it comes to potential owners, for the creature from which they are taken is one of the most independent and detached in the world. These wands are the hardest to tame and to personalise, and their allegiance is usually hard won.

It doesn't really suggest anything about whether the witch/wizard that a phoenix feather wand chooses is good or bad. If you read the descriptions of the other two wand cores (unicorn and dragon heartstring) on Pottermore, you'll also find that the phoenix feather wand core appears to be the most neutral of the three cores. At least, that's how I saw it.

Either way, wandlore seems to often be very vague and open to a lot of interpretations. The wand chooses the witch or wizard but I don't recall anywhere mentioning that the wand is a reflection of the witch or wizard it chose. The way Ollivander talks about wands, it's almost as if they're alive and have some form of sentience, and looking at Pottermore, there is also a suggestion that wands can cultivate personalities of their own--not very distinct ones, of course, but enough so that I doubt that wandlore ever boils down to a certain core equating to an impossibility, only an increase or decrease in the likelihood of a wand selecting a witch/wizard.

Hope this made sense.
