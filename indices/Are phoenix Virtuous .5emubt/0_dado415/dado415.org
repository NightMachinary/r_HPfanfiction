Fawkes is definitely a good character. Much like Hedwig is a good character. Fawkes helps Harry slay the basilisk and heals him. Fawkes helps his master escape and weeps when Dumbledore dies. This phoenix is definitely a virtuous and loyal figure.

The phoenix of mythology, however, is a bit different. It really depends what era or what worldview you'd like to take as basis for your interpretation. The very first mention of a phoenix was as a "Benu" in ancient egypt. The Greeks would then continue the mythos with the phoenix and the creature continues to be a part of everyday vocabulary (and stories).

The original interpretation or symbolism of the phoenix was as a herald of cycles. The cycle of Day and Night, of the moon, of the year or even longer cycles. The Benu represented the coming of the harvest after the flood of the nile in August. Once the egyptian lands were fertile again, the Benu came reborn from his stay in the north. The phoenix was eventually seen as born from Osiris ashes (note: Osiris is the god of the afterlife, rebirth and the nile) to live a long life and then build a nest from where it is reborn again. Late ancient Greeks saw the phoenix as a symbol of rebirth, rather detached from the god Osiris. The Christians later saw it as a symbol for resurrection, as seen on many depictions in medieval churches and drawings. Note that Rebirth and resurrection are two different things. The one makes the cycle start again (as a baby), the other lets something continue from where it ended.

Knowing that we can deduct that the phoenix in HP is more a greek interpretation than a christian. Fawkes too is transformed into an egg and reborn as a small phoenix-hatchling, rather than resurrected.

So, *tl;dr:* Phoenixes are neither good nor bad, inherently. They represent rebirth and the continuum of cycles and time itself. They also represent a form of eternity of being, something Dumbledore also believed in so much that he gave his life, knowing that he would find something beyond the realm of the living, where a new cycle of his existence would begin.
