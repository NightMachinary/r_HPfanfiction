As far as wand lore, you can't just take the core as gospel; you must also consider the wand wood. Voldemort has a yew and Phoenix feather wand, the yew's connection to death strengthening and emphasizing the Phoenix's rebirth aspect to make a wand good for necromancy. In contrast, Harry's holly wand is more aligned with the light and healing embodied by the Phoenix.
