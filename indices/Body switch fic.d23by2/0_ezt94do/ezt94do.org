Six Pomegranate Seeds

The author is clearly keen on the /snobby pure-blood, arranged-marriages, chaperones, weird-antediluvian-pureblood-etiquette, magical-Downton-Abbey-turned-up-to-eleven/, sort of thing. Hermione gets thrown into this milieu by a spot of time-travel and being put her in the body of a pure-blood girl who's one of the sacred twenty-eight Rosiers.

It's a genre that's /not/ to my taste. And Hermione/Cathal Rosier is a bit Mary Sue-ish. Yet I was surprised how long I kept with it, simply because it's so very well written.
