You make a great point.

When I was first thinking about that, the only thing I was focused on was counting Rs in the names, Harry Potter and Hermione Granger both have 3 Rs in them... (and 2 out of 3 Rs are in Harry's first name.)

Really the main question is why it isn't HG. The only thing I can think of is it might resemble the notation for a Hinny (H/G) fic.

But good point.
