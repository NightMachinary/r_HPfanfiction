#+begin_quote
  Albus and Scorpius return from the past and continue their school year and everything slowly seems to go back to normal again. After some time however, Scorpius notices that there is something seriously wrong with his best friend. Meanwhile Albus wakes up in a place he doesn't know and inside a body that certainly doesn't belong to him.
