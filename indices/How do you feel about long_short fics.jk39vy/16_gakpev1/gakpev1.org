  Do you feel intimidated by long stories (100k words and up)?

Yes, because I'm afraid of them being of medium quality. If they stink I stop reading right away, no problem. If they're good, then that's what I wanted and I come away happy. Medium = I usually read it the whole way through, burning however many days of reading time, and feel empty and exhausted afterwards.

i don't mind unfinished. There's one currently at 300k+ that I like a lot, that is still coming in installments, so I've read it in bits and pieces as they've gone up. But I wouldn't want to read that much in one go.
