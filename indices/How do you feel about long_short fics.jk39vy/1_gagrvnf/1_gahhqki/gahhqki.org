hard agree on the conclusion thing. I've taken to just bailing out sometimes when I feel that a fic has concluded nicely, even if there's twenty or fifty more chapters to go. Some of these long boys have been written over years, and while that's a credit to the writers' persistence, sometimes you can split them into two or three stories, because the tone changes (having said that I've been writing so slowly I know I have the same problem, so I'm not critiquing too hard lmao)
