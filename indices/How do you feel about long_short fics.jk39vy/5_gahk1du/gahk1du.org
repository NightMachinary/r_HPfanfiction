Depends on how you do it. Long or short fics aren't intrinsically bad, but a lot of fics are longer than they should be or shorter than they could be.

There's a significant portion of 100K word fics that could be far better at 30K words after removing excess dialogue or redundant chapters and such. More narration is great, but there's a certain point where you get too many words being used and too few details being described.

Equally, there are many one-shots and shorter fics that leave me wanting a 100K epic follow-up to them.

Like tropes, pairings, and everything else, it's not what you do, but how you do it. :)
