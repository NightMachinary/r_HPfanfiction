I only read fics with at least 6k words. If a short fic is heavily recommended, I may try it.

Typically, 25k-38k is too long for a short story and too short for anything else.

If it's near 100k words, I'll always read it until I reach the end or I physically start cringing. I hate it when a story is not complete, but I'd rather there be a story than not because I can finish it in my head. I only read HP fanfic because I want to be immersed in a world. Worldbuilding is a must. I want to /live/ as the characters. (Other fandoms that I've tried have disappointed.)
