I rarely read anything below 7k. My preference is between 15k and 40k for a shorter fic and most definitely above 100k for a longer fic. I have read 1mil and above fics but they're not my favourite, I much prefer that a writer splits up their story in arcs/seperate fics instead and creates a series.
