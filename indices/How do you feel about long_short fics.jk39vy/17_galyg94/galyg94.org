Maybe I'm just odd, I prefer longer fics and I tend filter out anything less than 40k-60k. Even the unfinished/abandoned 100k+ ones don't bother me as much as a 35k abandoned one. 7 times out of 10 if it's abandoned past the 100k mark its because the story has slowed to a crawl, the author has written themselves into a box, or the energy has just gone on both ends, and I can happily set the story down.
