20k-100k is perfect I think.

500k is too much already, and above that... *shudders*. unless it's some kind of retelling of the series starting with book one and continuing to book 7. but I have to like it to continue reading.

it also depends on what is written in that many words. like, having 50k words that only describe Harry shopping in Diagon Alley is waaay too much, but 200k words that takes in one whole year is ok.

world building also need more words to... build.

I don't like one-shots (less than 5k words). very forgettable or depressing or about nothing.
