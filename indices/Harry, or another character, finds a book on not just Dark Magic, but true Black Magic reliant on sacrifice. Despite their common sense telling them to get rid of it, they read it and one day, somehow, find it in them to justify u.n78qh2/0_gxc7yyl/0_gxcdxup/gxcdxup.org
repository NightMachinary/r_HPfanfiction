I love the seduction of the Dark Arts. It's JUST 7 children... and then the next Dark Lord appears and it's JUST one life... and then it's just one life to help protect Hogwarts for generations, and only a few lives to root out the traitors in the Ministry. Eventually it is yearly rituals to help safeguard against future Dark Lords.... etcetera etcetera
