Dark rituals that can destroy weakened main soul of individual with Horcruxes, without the need find them.

The price is sacrificing innocent children.

This book is hidden among Dumbledore's secret stash, dark magic books he had acquired, but unwilling to destroy. It was however Grindelwald who first found this particular book in Magical Egypt and translated into German. After Dumbledore became aware of Voldemort's Horcruxes, he translated this section into English, with the intention of using it as a final resort.

Hermione read this book during their Horcrux hunt, as she found it curious that Dumbledore kept a German magic book. But when she explained that section to Harry, he completely ruled it out.

Several months later, after they were stuck on their hunt, Hermione mentioned it again. Harry again refused, after a somewhat heated argument. Then they came across an extremely gruesome Death Eater atrocity, and he finally changed his mind:

"If we do not stop him, hundreds, thousands, or even millions will suffer their horrible fate. The lives of 7 innocent children may very well be worth it, if this ritual works!"
