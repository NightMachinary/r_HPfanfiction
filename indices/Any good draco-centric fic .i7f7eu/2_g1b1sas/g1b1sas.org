My favorite of all time is "Manacled" by Senlinyu. It's probably the most popular Dramione fic out there. It's an AU where Voldemort wins the war and many witches are forced into being a broodmare for the death eater they're assigned to. Hermione is one of them and has completely lost her memories from back during the war. She is assigned to the "High Reeve" who is Voldemort's most powerful death eater and right-hand man. This is also Draco. Basically the fic is about their relationship as her being his "slave" for a little while until eventually it explores what happened in her lost memories. It's a very good fic and I highly recommend it.
