I've been reading "The Mirror of Ecidyrue" series on ao3 and I love it, it's a time travel fix it of sorts where Draco goes back to his eleven year old self. The author is currently uploading the third book and the relationship is Draco Malfoy/Harry Potter. It's all very well written, there's an amazing development and interesting plot in each book, and it has some angsty parts as well as funny and sweet ones. 10/10 would recommend.
