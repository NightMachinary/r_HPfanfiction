A good way to somewhat alleviate this is by making the goblins as intentionally obtuse, annoying and unhelpful as possible. I usually use these few rules when writing them:

1. answers cost money. If you ask something, the answer will cost money depending on its length and complexity.

2. No forthcoming. There are no hints, no helpful suggestions.

3. Always aim for circles. The goblin you're talking to wants to maximize his own cash, so he answers questions in such a way that the wizard never quite gets what he's actually looking for.
