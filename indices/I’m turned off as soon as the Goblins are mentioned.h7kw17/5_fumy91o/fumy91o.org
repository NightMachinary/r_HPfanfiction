Helpful Goblins is basically a series of plausible enough conclusions taken too far on a slippery slope.

We know Goblins handle banks. In the Wizarding World, banks basically seem to be glorified storage safes. Thus, it would make some amount of sense that they would have a hand in executions of wills -- which would transfer ownership of a vault to the next of kin, or whatever the late owner wished. To facilitate this, it's plausible enough that Goblins would have a way of tracking familial ties, to legitimize someone's claim on a vault. And so on, until you suddenly have fanon helpful goblins, which is no longer in the realm of plausibility.
