[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/enter-the-dragon-harry-potter-shadowrun.7861/][Enter the Dragon]] has a lot of goblin involvement. They're friendly to Harry because his draconic biology includes a number of substances with remarkable properties such as a high-temperature superconductor, so his partnership is worth a mint.

(Also, they would quite like to see the horribly corrupt and racist wizarding society disrupted, and Harry's presence has the potential to do that.)
