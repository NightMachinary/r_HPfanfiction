[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/369727/chapters/602150][Inter Arma...]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/Hogwarts-Houses-Divided][Hogwarts Houses Divided]] are both next-gen fics involving future goblin rebellions, and IIRC they're both done quite well. I like the goblins as a next-gen antagonist with more moral ambiguity to the conflict, as opposed to the mostly black-and-white, good-vs-evil plot of the canon books.
