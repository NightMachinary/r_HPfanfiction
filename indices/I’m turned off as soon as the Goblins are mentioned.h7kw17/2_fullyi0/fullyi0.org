It gives me flashbacks to the ‘Harry is Lord Potter/Lord Black and is also now called Hadrian and he goes back in time and tells everyone to get fucked!! Wizard politics!!' trend that was popular in fic for a while.

God, I hate those type of fics. Up there with ‘wrong boy-who-lived James and Lily suddenly neglect Harry' fics as my most hated tropes.
