Yes! These two are my absolute worst as well. ESPECIALLY the Harry is Lord Potter-Black-Peverell-Slytherin stuff. I'll admit I've used the concept of wizarding aristocracy in my own fics (because the political heirarchy isn't properly explained in canon and I needed something as I was basing the ministry on the two tier way the Muggle UK does politics), but the idea that an eleven year old suddenly controlled half of the magical government is just, nah. Also the tropes of the kids who are normal in canon suddenly start bowing to each other and saying "well met" and other bollocks like they're in a Georgian novel, and Ron is inevitably discarded because he's just too stupid and common. Argh.

See also the fics where the trip to gringotts takes about five chapters and three of those are just /lists of properties and random "magical inheritance" things/ all of which have been stolen by Dumbledore.
