there's fics which take it way, way way too far, as well. I remember reading one that had muggleborns have no human or civil rights, and purebloods able to /claim them as concubines/. And of course Harry has to step in and claim them for himself to protect them.

Like, dude, fuck. I think the author had some problems, honestly.

I kinda want to read a fic where the ICW fucking politically annihilates wizarding britain as soon as they hear about that shit. Like, ICW troops occupying the ministry and every major wizarding space, including Hogwarts, suspending and annulling all political positions held by citizens of that country, starting an account of all wizards and their conditions to detect and free any such slaves. They just sweep in and destroy centuries of rotten "tradition" and corrupt "laws".
