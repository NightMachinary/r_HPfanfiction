Justice you shall Pursue by White Squirrel is the second one you mention.

There aren't many stories where Goblins raise Harry. I made one of the Harrys in Keystone Council the adopted son of the Goblin King, but his adoptive mother is an Irish muggleborn witch. So they treat it like a multicultural thing and try to give him the best of both worlds, so to speak. And even then, with him being pretty much a dual citizen, I still find myself trying hard to avoid cliche nonsense.
