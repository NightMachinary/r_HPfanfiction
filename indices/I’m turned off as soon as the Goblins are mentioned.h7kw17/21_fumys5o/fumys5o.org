I quite like the goblins . They are another magical race in the Harry Potter books that allow you to explore different cultures and customs of Rowlings magical world. If they're used incorrectly it kind of makes the story a little much but if you use them As part of the plot to add some intrigue politics or just some interesting characters they can be quite useful I wrote a story ones were Mycroft Holmes Evans Harry Potter's stepdad. It was really enjoyable writing a chapter where Mycroft paid the goblins A ridiculous amount of money to ward the Holmes estate agains Death Eaters. I researched a lot about ancient cultures and druid runes To kind of tie that into the goblins culture, and their skill with wards and Crafting magical objects. The goblins are a great tool for world building.
