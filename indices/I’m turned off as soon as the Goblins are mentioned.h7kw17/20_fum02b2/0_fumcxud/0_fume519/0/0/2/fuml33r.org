Robst was very popular writer. No need to worry about grammar and spelling. He regularly completes his stories unlike so called great writers who takes a year to post a chapter. That's what I admire in him. But, he mostly writes stories with overused tropes. Or, many authors uses his stories and made them into tropes.
