I can agree with pairings between preteens. If the story has them together before they're at least thirteen, then I really get uncomfortable. Especially when they mention sex. I can't tell you how many times where all of these bloody eleven year olds keep sneaking innuendos into everything and how they end up kissing and stuff. Like, you're freaking ELEVEN.
