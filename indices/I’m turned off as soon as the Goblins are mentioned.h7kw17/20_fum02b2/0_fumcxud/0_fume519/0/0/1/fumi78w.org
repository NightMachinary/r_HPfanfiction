I recently read Harry Crow, though I really skimmed through the last couple of dozen chapters. I agree that the writing style works but after a while the events involving Harry and the goblins virtually taking over Hogwarts all start to become more and more unlikely, though this is one of the few stories I have read which makes a reasonable attempt to portray goblin society in more detail.
