Thanks! I'm about 1/3 of the way writing it and want to be more like 2/3 before I post it, but I am looking for a beta team if you're interested in helping me whip this into shape. When it's finished it should be about 800,000 words, primary ship is SS/OC, and content warnings for just about every chapter. If that sounds like something you'd like to get the first read, DM me and I'll get you a share link. I'm looking for a while team, including Grammar Nazi, Brit Picker, and Continuity/Canon Checker.
