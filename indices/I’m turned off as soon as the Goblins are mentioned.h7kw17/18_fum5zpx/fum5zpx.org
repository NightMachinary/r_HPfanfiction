I have a little plot bunny that started as a side-quest for the goblins in another epfic I'm writing, but I think it might have to be its own fic... The protagonist OC is a musician and a Healer, learning about the /old ways/ with elemental magic, and the main story is set during books 6 & 7 but I think this might be sequel material as she learns about the complicated and bloody history between wizards and goblins.

--------------

When she approached the first available clerk with her name and wand, he, rather politely for a goblin, said, "Before you go to your vault, please follow me." And then he led her to one of the offices on the back wall of the atrium.

The goblin inside was Sorayo, who facilitated Liz's through-service with the even more elite bank Gavivis in Egypt. "Come in, Healer Althea. Have a seat."

She did, but this was weird. Goblins being cordial? She was actually surprised to see a guest chair in a goblin's office at all.

"We wish to learn the magic of your recording devices."

"Ah," Liz said, relaxing just a bit. Business schmoozing. That she understood. "A third party has begun wholesale production under my patent. Would you care to be connected to this supplier?"

"No. Relying on mass production is insufficient. We wish to learn the magic directly."

Liz rather wished she had Herr Schwarz in the room, but she figured this might be a little too high-stakes to delay for the arrival of her solicitor. "All musical applications of this magic must be licensed under my patent, but I suspect that your intent is about security surveillance for Gringotts. Is that right?"

"And also Gavivis."

"An important detail. So, I would teach security personnel for Gringotts and Gavivis. Anyone else included in the /we/ who want this magic?"

Sorayo shook his head.

Pinching the bridge of her nose, Liz said, "The thing is, under patent law, I must pursue either compensation or litigation for all use of my patented work. If I teach you this magic, my solicitor will draw a magical contract to be filed under my patent, with strict outlines for how it may be used, but I am flexible as to the nature of the compensation. You know better than most that I don't need more gold."

A twisted little smirked graced Sorayo's face. "Humans."

She smirked right back. "Goblins."

"Ha, you are an odd one, Healer Althea. What kind of compensation do you want?"

"If I am to teach you a rare /new/ secret of magic, then perhaps you have a rare /old/ secret to trade me. In particular, any Mysteries of Air should be mine to practice and protect."

Sorayo's posture straightened. "You are an Air Priestess?"

Liz nodded.

"Music and sound and soul healing. I see it now." He rose and stepped over to the long shelf on the wall behind his desk. He carefully selected a glass box holding a single scroll and laid it gingerly on his desk. Then he took his seat and said, "You must be aware that Storytelling is a Mystery of Air."

She was only just learning this from her extended family, but she said coolly, "Of course."

"The history of us goblins is mostly locked in oral tradition. Wizards," he sneered the word before he schooled his expression, apparently remembering that he wanted something from the witch across the desk, "have revised the written accounts to include but a shadow of our heritage. I will offer you the story of the goblins."

Liz shifted in her seat. She probably should have studied harder for Binns' class, but it was far too late to regret that now. "You have my attention."

Sorayo opened the lid of the glass box by stroking one long finger across the edge. Then he picked up and unrolled the parchment, setting it down for Liz to examine.

It was crammed full of drawings and runes, some of it overlapping, with four distinct colors of ink.

"In the Wars of Genocide, we lost nearly all of our Priestesses."

Liz blinked in surprise, and she wondered if he meant the period that Binns referred to as The Goblin Wars. Naturally, the goblins would have seen things a little differently.

"With the wizards closing in, the last four High Priestesses hid their grimoires and made this map."

Her stomach dropped. He was offering her a map to a goblin library? Probably the only goblin library outside the banks? Damn. She needed to play it cool, though, to be sure. "Let me get this straight. In exchange for exclusive new Air magic, you are offering me /work/? A quest to uncover your history for you?"

His eyes narrowed. "Most of the remaining goblins would call me a traitor for even showing this to you. They believe, understandably, that wizards only rape, pillage, exterminate, and /erase/ other magical beings."

She didn't know what to say, so she waited. She got the impression that she was representing wizard-kind at the moment, and she didn't want to muck things up like everything else lately.

"But I am inclined to trust an Air Priestess. Air and Earth are the Soul Healers. Air and Fire are the agents of swift change. Air and Water give life itself. And, among them, Air is the most rare."

Liz had wondered about that. In all her travels, she had met many women who could have been Priestesses, both alchemical and celestial, but only one that she now suspected was an Air Priestess. What she would give for five minutes alone with Madam Miku!

"What I am offering you, Air Priestess, is a chance to be the kind of Healer that I now know you are."

Closing her eyes, she looked inward and realized that he was right. This was exactly the magnitude of duties befitting a High Priestess. If the wizards had murdered the High Priestesses among the goblins, then maybe she had a responsibility to set it right. She opened her eyes and insisted, "I'm not ready."

"No, of course not, and even this map is too much for you alone. You might be able to decipher and understand the contribution of the Air Priestess, but you will most likely need the other three to unlock all its secrets and begin the quest."

She understood the scope of the problem now. She dropped her eyes to her hands, wringing in her lap. "I have so much work to do," she whispered, and then raised both her head and her voice. "And I do not know any other alchemical Priestesses to help me."

They both leaned back and regarded each other for a moment. Then Sorayo said, "It has waited centuries already. Do what you must, but for now, have Herr Schwarz draw up that contract. Once it is signed, I will deposit this treasure in your vault. And I will ward its case to be opened only by the full quartet of Priestesses required to read it."

Liz nodded.

"Now, get out before my colleagues start to wonder what we're up to."

Chuckling in relief at his return to barely-disguised contempt, Liz did as she was told.
