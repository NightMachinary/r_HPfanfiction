It depends on how they are represented, if they are just the True Neutral keepers of the gold, that favor no one and just do what they are supposed to as a Bank and validate credentials, that's Ok.

I just find it logical that wizards would trust a true neutral faction with their money, it's the best way to not risk it in case the wind changes or something.

If Harry says Thank You and Good Morning and now they all treat him as a hero, and give him mountains of gold, then it's just stupid.
