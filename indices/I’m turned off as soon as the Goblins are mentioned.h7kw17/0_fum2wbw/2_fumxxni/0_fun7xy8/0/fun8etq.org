Well, you can say that among all this, the goblins were never accused of /stealing/, whereas, would you trust the Ministry to guard your money and to validate your bloodline?

In fact, Bellatrix Lestrange one of the most bigoted of them all, trusted Gringotts to hold one the Horcruxes.

Umbridge may call them creatures and everything, but she never implies they were thieves.

Voldemort was the only one to attack them because he wanted the Sword back and knew he had to take it by force.

So even pureblood supremacists may hem and haw but in the end all their gold and valuables are in the hands of the goblins, what's the difference of letting them validate bloodlines that will have access to that gold?
