It makes sense for the goblins to deal with inheritance and genealogy and all that, if you look from the perspective of wizards from all sides wanting a neutral faction who won't end up screwing them over.

They also predate the Ministry and seem to operate independently from it.

It's a trope that makes sense if you apply it right.

The having secret rituals however is totally out there.

And stealing implies not having lawful and rightful access if the account holder says you can't, you can't regardless if you have the password/key.
