They trust them with their GOLD, their money, their valuables.

If they thought they were unreliable they wouldn't leave their money with them. Throughout all canon, no goblin was ever accused of being a thief.

Wizards wouldn't trust themselves with their bloodlines(if such a thing was needed in canon), the Ministry manages to screw up a lot of things and it wouldn't be out of the realm of possibility for line theft to be practiced.

I am talking of the possibility of Goblins being True Neutral as if one side has the majority there's no way to know if the heirs from the other side would be denied their inheritances. The same way the Ministry could freeze or monitor specific Vaults, or even confiscate them. But Goblins serve both sides as long as they aren't attacked.

The Lestranges all got life sentences and left no heirs, in this case the government would confiscate their assets, and yet 16 years later it's all there, including the Soul Jar.

And not all Wizards are racist assholes, I would guess not even all Death Eaters are racist, they are just assholes and only want to kill and torture(doesn't make it better).
