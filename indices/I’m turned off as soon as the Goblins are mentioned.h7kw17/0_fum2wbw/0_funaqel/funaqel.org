From [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12999698/10/Scribble-Pad]], in which a typical indy!Harry fic is an in-universe book about Harry's adventures, and he gets some wild ideas:

  "Greetings, noble goblin," Harry told him. "May your gold always flow."

  All of the Weasleys and the goblin gave Harry a strange and confused look, and he blushed and lowered his head. That didn't go off so well.

  "What was that about?" Ron whispered.

  "I was trying to be polite," Harry said.

  Percy shook his head: "Goblins are practical beings, Mr. Potter. Excessive politeness annoys them more often than not."

  That was a surprise to Harry. That greeting had come from Ginny's book. He knew a lot of it wasn't accurate, but he had thought they would get basic facts about the magical world right.

  Sufficiently chastised, he played it more cautiously with what he really wanted to ask. The Harry in the book had got a lot of help here, but now, he wasn't so sure. When the cart came to a halt, he said, "Um, excuse me, Mr...?"

  "Gornuk," the goblin grunted.

  "Mr. Gornuk, I was wondering if...Gringotts has any legal services."

  Gornuk looked at Harry like he was stupid. "And why would you ask that Mr. Potter?" he demanded.

  "Well, it's just that my muggle relatives are really awful, and I'm pretty some of the stuff they've done to me is illegal, and I was wondering---"

  "No, Mr. Potter, I meant why would you ask that of us? I would think you would want to take something like that up with your Department of Magical Law Enforcement."

  Harry wasn't sure what to say to that. He really hadn't expected a flat-out dismissal. "I, uh, was just wondering if there was anything you could do---"

  "And why on earth would you wonder that?"

  "Um...If you had any special legal services for your customers---"

  "Mr. Potter," the goblin said in an aggravated tone, "we run a bank. We handle money. We are goblins, not wizards. Even if we were in the business of law enforcement, which we are not, and even if we took any interest at all in the private affairs of wizards, which we don't, we wouldn't have the jurisdiction to punish offences committed in the muggle world, now, would we?"

  Harry was speechless. His entire view of goblins from the book was turned on its head. The Harry in the book had had the goblins go after the brutal owners of the orphanage for him straightaway and sentence them to a life of hard labour in their gold mines, and here, Gornuk was just looking at him like he was from Mars. But he was right: why would the goblins get involved in something like that? And why would wizards let them? "I...didn't really think of that, Mr. Gornuk," he said awkwardly.

  "Ugh. Wizards," Gornuk griped. "Just where did you get these wild ideas, Mr. Potter?"

  "Well, there was this book---" Harry started, but Gornuk immediately started growling.

  "A bit of free advice, wizard---and listen well because that is something extremely rare in Gringotts. Most wizards know nothing of how goblins operate. They make no effort to learn our culture, and they would rather concoct their own fantasies from whole cloth than actually talk to us. You should be cautious in trusting an actual history book about goblins, let alone an admitted fiction."

  Harry was taken aback. He didn't realise that even a wizard who wrote fiction would be so sloppy about something like that. "Oh...Sorry," he said sheepishly. "I'm kind of new to the magical world."

  "Hmpf," Gornuk said. "I will not begrudge you, Mr. Potter, this time, because you are young, inexperienced, and muggle-raised, and you have been misled by an absurd book. However, I warn you that you are only the latest in a long line of wizards who think that if they spout off some supposed secret goblin greeting or because their great-grandfather was nice to us once, that we'll suddenly fall all over ourselves to be their friends. In the real world, that's a good way to 'accidentally' get redirected to the wrong department, or worse."

  "Oh..." Harry said nervously. Considering that some of the 'departments' had dragons in them, that didn't sound like a very good thing. Although wizards surely wouldn't have much tolerance for goblins actually hurting wizards in the bank. Right? Well, he decided it wasn't worth the risk to find out.

  However, when they got to his vault, he realised he did have one more question. More carefully than last time, he said, "Mr. Gornuk, do you know if I have any...other vaults here?"

  "Other vaults?" the goblin said suspiciously. "Are you a business owner, Mr. Potter?"

  "No."

  "Then almost certainly not. And I can't imagine why you would need them."

  "Well, there's only gold in here. I was wondering what happened to my parents' stuff."

  "I would suspect it's in storage with your Ministry, wizard. What you see is what you have."

  "Oh. And if I had any distant relatives who, er, died in the war or something?" Harry said carefully.

  "Ministry records. In the unlikely event that you find something, bring us notarised documentation, and we'll release it to you."

  "Alright. Thanks, Mr. Gornuk."

  Gornuk rolled his eyes at the courtesy, but that one really was just Harry trying to be polite. Maybe he would take up his questions with the Ministry, like Gornuk said, he thought. Deciding he would ask Mr. Weasley about whom he could write a letter when he got the chance, he successfully got out of Gringotts without annoying any more goblins, and he and the Weasleys rejoined with Hermione's family to do their shopping.
