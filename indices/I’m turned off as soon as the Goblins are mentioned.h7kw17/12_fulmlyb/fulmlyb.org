I remember reading one short fic that when Harry goes to Gringotts and knows nothing about his accounts that the goblins rob him blind. Though I can't find the story.

In the story Lucky Harry by pyrgus Harry knows that the goblins can't be trusted and in fact has betrayed him. So one day he slaughters all the goblins steals from all the deatheaters and ministry lackeys and returns their wealth to the families of the few students who treated him well.
