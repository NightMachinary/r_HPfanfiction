"Greetings Honored Bloodclaw. May your Gold Ever flow in rivers into your vaults. may your enemies cower in fear at your advance. my your name be remembered in the annals of history for your fervor in battle!"

"What was all of that?"

"The ancient greeting of the goblin Race?"

"Who are you?"

"I'm LORD Hadrian Potter-Black-Peverell-Gryff-"

"I'm charging seventeen galleons from your vault."

WHAT? WHY?"

"The amount of my time you just wasted with your inane 'greeting' was worth seventeen galleons, so we're deducting it from you account. Now shut up, and get in line, wizard."
