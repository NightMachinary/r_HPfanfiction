  Can all living wizards who have chocolate frog cards spy then?
#+end_quote

This was my immediate thought too, and I get the sense that photographs do not act as spies (can they even talk?) in the same way portraits can. Harry has his photograph taken, and did not gain a spy on Colin Creevey through it (and if he had, he probably would have used it, so as to avoid Colin!). Plus, we know Dumbledore had a spy or spies in Albania watching Voldemort, so does this mean Voldemort kept a chocolate frog collection in Albania? What happens when the person he's spying on puts the card in a box and never looks at it again?

Having said that, it's a fun prompt for a fic, but just not really canonical.
