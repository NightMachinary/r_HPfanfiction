I like your rambling.

"Same old story, a bit damaged means possibility for redemption, too much (visible) damage is off-putting."

Though I reckon you're right, this is such a horribly sad thing and I think GRRM wanted to make it impossible for SC to ever look even close to okay. I think that looking at him is painful in the beginning is a very defining trait for him, so much that it directed his entire life. I know they tend to make things easier for mainstream media, but for me this is too much. Same goes for the age thing, I understand that you can not show the rape of a 13 year old. But a bitter angry 50 year old is completely different than an angry bitter 26 year old.

Since I read a few ASOIAF fics I also wonder if they not just made him pretty, but completely white washed Tyrion in the series, because he seems to be viewed as an all around nice dude and not someone who participated in the gang rape of his wife, just because he thought she had betrayed him.

There is just one thing that the show did, that I absolutely love though: They made Ramsay hot. In the books he is not much to look at, but I love that for once a completely horrible sadist is one of the hottest guy in the series.

I think ASOIAF is about deeply complicated characters and everything that makes it easier for the viewer always take away from the brilliance of the original material.
