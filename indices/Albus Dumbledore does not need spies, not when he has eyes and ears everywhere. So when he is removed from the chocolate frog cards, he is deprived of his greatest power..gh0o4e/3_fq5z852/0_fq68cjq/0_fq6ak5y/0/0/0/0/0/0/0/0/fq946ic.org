Yeah but George does always go to the extreme, I think it's more realistic and almost certainly more practical for the show.

I really like Catelyn's actress and she does look like someone you could believe could look like Sansa when younger. What might have helped is having a painting or something of a younger Catelyn just being the Sansa actress to emphasise the idea though.

They look less and less alike as the seasons go on that's for sure. But both are too good of actors for me to mind.
