The brilliant thing about reading is that everyone imagines the characters a bit differently, yes along the descriptions given but someone queasy about scars/burns etc. might imagine them less severe than GRRM indicated they were simply because our brain likes to keep our imagination within bounds we can easily live with (without to much horror). Also I imagine for the show they wanted someone suitably coarse for the monstruos part of his character, but someone who can also do the "tortured by his bigger brother" arc believably without looking outrageously damaged. Same old story, a bit damaged means possibility for redemption, too much (visible) damage is off-putting. So I'd say the casting and make-up choices were mostly to increase ambiguity of the character by making him more "neither here nor there" in terms of disfigurement.

Sorry for the rambling, it's just something I like to ponder. The differences between descriptions in books and the images I create in my head sometimes are really interesting to analyze, especially when those books get cinematized too and one has to cope with another set of character's looks that just confuses things even more.
