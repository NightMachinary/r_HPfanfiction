I disagree with you there. The description in the books is very different and way, waaaay worse. He looks like he has been burnes superficially on a small part of his head and has been treated after. The SC in the books has half his face melted off, cannot close his mouth properly and his jaw bone peeks out. That is wildly different. The actor has been given a scar, but nothing that would make anyone go "holy shit". Oh, and he should have black hair, grey eyes and a hooked nose. None of which he has in the series.

I agree with you on Jon and Daenerys, they look completely different in my head. I am still disappointed that they did not even care enough to give her violet eyes and really white hair (eyebrows!). Well, everyone looks very, very different. Sansa as well. They really should have picked a real mother and daughter for her and Catelyn, that they look alike is so essential for the whole Littlefinger creepiness.

And I personally think Jaime and Cersei do not look alike at all. And Tyrion was not even a little ugly.
