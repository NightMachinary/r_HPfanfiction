I thought he was pretty good. Not necessarily the closest to the character but far from the worst. His scars are pretty accurate as far as I know from seeing some burn victims. Like that's exactly what he would look like.

The worst casting I thought was well...Jon and Daenerys. Emilia and Kit improved but they were kind of bad for much of it. And don't look enough like the characters to justify it.
