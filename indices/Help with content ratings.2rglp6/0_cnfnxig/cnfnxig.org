From the ESRB ratings (which the Fiction ratings are copies of):

#+begin_quote
  TEEN\\
  Content is generally suitable for ages 13 and up. May contain violence, suggestive themes, crude humor, minimal blood, simulated gambling and/or *infrequent use of strong language*.
#+end_quote

Fictionratings.com agrees:

#+begin_quote
  Suitable for teens, 13 years and older, with some violence, *minor coarse language*, and minor suggestive adult themes.
#+end_quote

If you have strong cussing with f-bombs throughout, mark it M to be certain. If it is just a few occurrences you can safely mark it as T -- although you might want to "warn" overly sensitive people in an author's note at the top of any chapter that you use such cussing in the chapter.

And remember that FFN demands that story summaries are T rated, without strong cussing. Stories have been removed there before because the /summary/ had too strong language in it, and someone reported it.
