linkffn(Faery Heroes) is a time-travel fic that also draws very heavily on LLaLL, and happens to be one of my all-time favorites. It does have some significant Dumbledore/Ron/Ginny/Molly bashing, but the hilarity of some of the stunts the trio pulls (like full-on Grinching the Notts on Christmas Eve) makes up for that.
