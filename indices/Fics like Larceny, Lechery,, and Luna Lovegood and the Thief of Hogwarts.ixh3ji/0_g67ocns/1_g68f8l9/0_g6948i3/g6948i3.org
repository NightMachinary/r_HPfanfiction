Whether the treatment of Dumbledore is even bashing depends on your interpretation of the character, given that it uses exclusively canonical information and events (solely from the books, even) to draw some very ugly conclusions about Dumbledore's actions.

Also, while the bashing of the Weasleys is pretty "meh", it does function in part as a setup for one of the most hilariously evil (and/or evilly hilarious) curses I've seen in fanfiction.
