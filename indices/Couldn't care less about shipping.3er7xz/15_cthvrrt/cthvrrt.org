The only time I'm care about ships is when they destrioy the story by A) makeing the story unbelievable or B) takeing over the story with 72386 chapters of romance and the characters fucking it out. You know what I mean. Those stories when after 50k words of bed gymnastics the reader is reminded that there once, in a land far far away, has been a story to follow.

Also there are some ships that (most of the time, there are always exceptions to the rule) are creeping me the fuck out. Hermione / Snape (/Sirius, /Remus,...) is such a case. Most of the time they feel just so fundamentally wrong to read, its disgusting.

And the other huge bummer is when you just *know* the author is a weeaboo with too much ecchi harem anime on his harddrive.^{^{you}} ^{^{know}} ^{^{who}} ^{^{you}} ^{^{are}}
