I care to the extent that I'm not really interested in stories with certain pairings such as those including Snape or Riddle. Beyond that I don't care as long as it's a good story. I read het, slash, femslash, gen, Harry-centric, stories where Harry doesn't even appear, etc. I have certain pairings that I do read more than others, but I have no OTP.

I think one of the problems with shipping is that the pairing should serve the story, not the other way around. The writing invariably suffers when it's merely a vehicle to force two characters together because you think they Belong Together.
