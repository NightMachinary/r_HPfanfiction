Harry Potter is one of the few fandoms where I don't ship anything strongly. I get why shipping is popular in general, given that a lot of media focuses on relationships in some sideplot or another, and sometimes it really is the draw and best thing in the story.

I wish there was a better way to define ships. I have a lot of ships where I don't need - or prefer it without - actual romance. Draco/Luna for example. I just think stories about their interaction and/or friendship would be interesting.
