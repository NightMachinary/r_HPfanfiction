I'll read pretty much any ship, het or slash, but I do think some are difficult to do well, or are commonly pretty rubbish. I'm not usually a fan of Harry/Draco or Draco/Hermoine simply because it often involves Draco as a classy bad boy, and that's simultaneosly boring and not very true to Draco's character. I find him much more interesting when he's his whiny canon self with questionable morals but a strong loyalty to his family.

I certainly have ideas of who I would have paired up in canon (Harry/Luna, Viktor/Hermione), but part of the fun of fanon is exploring the outlandish pairings and seeing them work, in my opinion.
