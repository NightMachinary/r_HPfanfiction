I prefer stories that don't focus too much on romance yet pull it off well. Romance stories on their own tend to have pretty annoying drama and leave everything else as an after-thought. I wouldn't say I particularly prefer a certain ship, but Harry/Luna particularly amuses me when it's pulled off (which is like never) and Hermione is nice too (but I see a lot of crap fics with her as the main pairing).

As for a decent Fleur story. This one is pretty good. The romance hasn't been developed entirely, but it's still updating I think and everything else is pretty good too. linkffn([[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358/1/What-You-Leave-Behind]])
