Technically Prince of the Dark Kingdom is Harry/Luna since it's literally the only relationship (though not a heavily detailed one) he's had, so that's one (she's also a werewolf). I haven't read that Firebird series yet either so I'll see how that goes, but I don't think it's exactly what I have in mind. It's definitely a nice pairing and I think it could work if someone could write it without it getting bogged down by certain things and not forcing it. They had some solid chemistry in-series with the threstals and such. No problem, I hope you like it and I think that well known time traveling fic, Wastelands of Time is Harry/Fleur as well.
