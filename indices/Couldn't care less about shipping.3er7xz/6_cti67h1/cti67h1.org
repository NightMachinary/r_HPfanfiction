I tend to read more romance fanfiction than romance fiction. I think it's because I prefer to fully know a character before I start shipping them with anyone. I don't like jumping into stories where you have to describe a character AND describe a romance at the same time. My mother likes to read trashy romance novels, and she thinks I'm very sophisticated for reading non-romantic books. Little does she know, I get my fix elsewhere...

I prefer strictly canon pairings (or pairings that could be canon if you spin a good story), but I will read otherwise in extreme AU's and crossovers. I will not read a pairing with an adult character and a non-consenting minor, but if you wait till they are of age/do some funky time-traveling...that's cool. It's my own morals -> I work with children. It makes me mad to see it glorified.

My favorite pairings: Harry/Ginny, Lily/James, Remus/Sirius, Rose/Scorpius

Funny enough, however, I think my favorite stories are always the ones that have romance as a side-plot or none at all. Usually, these are stories that expand upon canon, or they are about characters who don't show up often in the main series. For example, the Alexandra Quick series and Against the Moon are two of my favorite fanfictions...and neither of them have romance as the main plot.
