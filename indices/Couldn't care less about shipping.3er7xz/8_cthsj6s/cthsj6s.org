Not to nitpick, but your post makes it seem like you do care at least a bit about shipping with the whole "any other *female* character in the universe." I mean, slash is shipping; it's not an extreme form or anything, it's just shipping.

My two cents though are that I don't mind shipping as long as the fic is well written... given the chance though I will definitely take a Harry/Draco fic over a just-as-well-written Harry/anyone-else fic.
