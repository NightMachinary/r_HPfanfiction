Sorry, I edited in a clarification afterwards. I just find it odd and misleading how slash is often talked about like a genre, because there's only one quality the stories have in common and that's the sexualities of their main characters. But I think we're talking about different things. The way I see it though, "I don't like slash" and "I don't like slash ships" and "I don't ship slash ships" mean the same thing.
