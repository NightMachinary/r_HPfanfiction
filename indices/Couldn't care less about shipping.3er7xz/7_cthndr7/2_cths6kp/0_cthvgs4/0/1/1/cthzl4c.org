Here's a link from 2004 on the issue, and the changes to the laws it complains about have past since then: [[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/the-limits-of-child-porn/article741770/]]

So, in short, depending on how you read our CP laws, Vampire Acadamy may be against the law. I'd assume the publishers spoke with some lawyers before publishing it though, so I'd go and buy it feeling safe. That doesn't apply to random fanfics involving people under 18 in sexual situations.
