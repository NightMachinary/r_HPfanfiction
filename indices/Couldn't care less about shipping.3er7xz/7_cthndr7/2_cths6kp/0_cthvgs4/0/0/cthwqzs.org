  Especially Harry/Snape fics tend to make Harry 14 or 15, and a good number of Snape/Hermione fics do this too (perhaps half-and-half).

And you know this because you read both Harry/Snape and Snape/Hermione so you have seen this in fics you've read or are you just stating what you think based on no prior experience reading those stories?

I read Snape/Hermione (but not Snape/Harry so I can not speak for them) and I've never read a fic where she has been 15 or younger in a relationship with Snape. Most fics I read (and I read a lot of Hogwarts Era fics), she is 17, 18 or even 19 (if it's an 8th year fic). A good portion of Snape/Hermione fics happen after Hogwarts as well so the age stuff there is a non-issue.
