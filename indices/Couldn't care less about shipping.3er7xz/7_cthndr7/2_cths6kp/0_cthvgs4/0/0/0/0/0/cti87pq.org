Be happy to prove it, if you can think of a way. And Scryer does let you filter that way: [[http://scryer.darklordpotter.net/search?utf8=&search[fandoms][]=224&search[title]=&search[author]=&search[summary]=&search[language]=english&search[status]=&search[rating][]=k&search[rating][]=k%2B&search[rating][]=t&search[rating][]=m&search[wordcount_lower]=150000&search[wordcount_upper]=&search[chapters_lower]=&search[chapters_upper]=&search[sort_by]=meta.words&search[order_by]=desc]]

Though when I started reading fics, 9 years ago, it didn't. And a little over 3 thousand fics seems about right, if you keep in mind by "read" I mean read a fic until I find one of the pairings I object to above and stop. That brings it down to maybe 2500 that I read all the way through, or less. And...a bit under a fic a day sounds about right for what I do. Sometimes more, sometimes less, but...around there.

Edit: make the link actually work.
