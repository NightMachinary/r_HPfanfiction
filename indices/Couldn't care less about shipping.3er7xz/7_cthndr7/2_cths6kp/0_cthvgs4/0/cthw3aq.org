No, I don't care if both characters are above the age of consent (18 where I live), and thus both adults. But I do come across lots of fics where they aren't, and not only do I not enjoy them, it exposes me to extreme legal liability that I don't want. I do care if one character is a teacher, and thus in a position of authority over the other, but that's just personal taste from personal life-experience, and I wouldn't call for restricting that.

Especially Harry/Snape fics tend to make Harry 14 or 15, and a good number of Snape/Hermione fics do this too (perhaps half-and-half).
