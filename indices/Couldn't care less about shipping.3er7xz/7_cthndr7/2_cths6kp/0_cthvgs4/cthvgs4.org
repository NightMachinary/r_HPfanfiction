So... if the character is above the age of consent, you still want the story banned because of an age difference you dislike? How about you just respect that others have different preferences?

Most snamione stories I read have Hermione as 18+ when the relationship begins which makes it weird how people refer to her as a child when criticizing pairings. those that don't at least have her above 16 which still is above the age of consent in most western countries, even a lot of the states.
