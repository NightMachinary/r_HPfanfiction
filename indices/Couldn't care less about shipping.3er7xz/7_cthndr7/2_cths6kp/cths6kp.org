Yes, ditto on the child/adult pairings. I deeply hate these, to the point that I wish FFN would just establish a policy banning them. DO NOT WANT! I dislike slash, but I won't refuse to read a good story because it plays a minor part. I'll refuse to read any story with a child/adult pairing, even if it's just a brief mention. It shouldn't be there.
