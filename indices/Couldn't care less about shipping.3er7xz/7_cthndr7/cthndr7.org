I dislike a few ships. I absolutely wont read Harry/Draco or Hermione/Draco. Or Harry/Snape Hermione/Snape or any other child/adult pairing for that matter.

I also dislike Ron/Hermione quite strongly. I think its the worst thing JK did with cannon and I prefer fics that /fix/ this oversight on her part.

All that said. I don't care if Harry is with anyone else, or Hermione, or Ron or Ginny or whoever.

Mostly it is about my ability to enjoy a story being hampered by a ship, rather than a ship enhancing a story.
