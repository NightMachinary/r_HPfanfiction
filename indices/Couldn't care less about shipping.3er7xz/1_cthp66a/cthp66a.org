IMO, when a pairing goes bad, it goes bad because of the way the author has to degrade and distort characters in order to make the 'ship work. Think the Harmony 'ship where Hermione is reduced to Harry's perennial damsel in distress, with no personality or initiative of her own or, conversely, where Harry is suddenly more interested in reading than in Quiddich --- or, even without degrading any given character, a 'ship that simply erases their rough edges, even though that's what makes them interesting; think the Dramione 'ship where Draco is suddenly this suave, rich, badboy sweeping a bookish ing√©nue (who cleans up nicely) off her feet.
