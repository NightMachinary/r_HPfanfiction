I read this kind of substory many times. Mostly it is something half involuntary, something like this:

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore (angry, approaching Harry during the meal in the Great Hall): what did you do to the Professor Binns?

  Harry (trying to look innocent): Did? I didn't do anything!

  Dumbledore: He refuses to teach now, and your classmates told me it was after talking with him!

  Harry: I just asked him whether he really likes to teach here! I mean, he is a ghost, so he doesn't teach to provide food on his table or something like that, right?

  Dumbledore: But he left!

  Harry: Yes, after I asked him, he was suddenly very thoughtful, and then he loudly cursed, that of course he doesn't want to spend time with bloody gobblin wars, he wanted to finally make a research of the history after the Grindewald's War, and he left.

Something of that sort.
