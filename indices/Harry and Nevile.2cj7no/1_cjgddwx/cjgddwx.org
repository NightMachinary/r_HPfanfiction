I'm pretty sure I recommended this one in a similar thread a while ago but I enjoy [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6763981/1/][The Dark Lord's Equal]].

  Summary: Years after the Epilogue things look bleak; Harry Potter agrees to go back to the Ministry Battle to change history for the better. Premise; "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think. Fight scenes, humour, romance, magic, and insanity. FINISHED

Disclaimer- the author borrows a ton of ideas from other fanfic authors so if that puts you off here's your fair warning. Despite that it's a story about a pretty badass Harry and Neville and it pulls it off really well.
