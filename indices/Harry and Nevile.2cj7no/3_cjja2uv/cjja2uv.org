When Harry receives his letter, his once painful existence turns into something resembling happiness. But when he gets to Hogwarts, the unusual abilities of the Sorting Hat call attention to what he was subjected to at the Dursley house, stopping the sorting, his subjection to the Dursley's, and all of Dumbledore's carefully laid plans concerning Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort.

It's in its early stages, definitely, so I understand if it's not something you're interested in.
