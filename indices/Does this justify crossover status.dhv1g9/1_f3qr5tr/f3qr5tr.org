  Is X-Men AU sufficiently common that readers would get it, and not just stare at the screen scratching their heads?

If it's not straight out of a recent capeshit movie, I doubt you can reasonably expect people to get what you're talking about. Even then, there probably are lots of people like me who can't be bothered to watch that stuff at all.

I'd put an xmen AU in the crossover section. At he very least mention it in the summary.
