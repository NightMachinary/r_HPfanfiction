In the fic Harry Potter and the Elemental's Power by Sage Ra there was a crossover with the main characters from Chuck who became side characters with fairly significant screen time. Thing is, they weren't treated like crossover characters typically are and just played the role of muggle intelligence agents and specialists that the plot required who also just happened to be crossover characters. I'm not even sure if they were named explicitly and their TV series was certainly never stated. They were not relevant or important to the majority of the story and it was right to not label the story as a Crossover, even if they had a large role at certain moments.

Similarly, Harry Potter and the Deus ex Machina had a James Bond crossover that was also treated with just enough significance to make then relevant and important characters but did not have enough relevance to the overall plot to categorize the story as a Crossover either.

Both of these stories are my ideal benchmark for inserting crossover characters without making your story a crossover in itself.

Crossovers have a lot of weight and expectation put on them. There is an expectation that either the two worlds will completely fuse, or else a character will be inserted into a world and be the main character, or an element of the crossover will be integrally important and essential to the plot. There is no room in the exception for a side character with little relevance outside their role. If you had Kakashi from Naruto show up as a judge during the tri-wizard tournament and have a few lines and funny moments and that was the entire role he had in your story that is not nearly enough to satisfy a crossover.

In your case, you have the option of marking your story as an AU HP/XMen Xover, or a plain HP story and including Psuedo Xmen AU in the summary. There is no getting out of explaining up front that a major portion of your plot hinges on these OC characters. The way to choose which one to go with is how OC they are. If there are blatant rip-off major characters like Fake-Logan who is a manor character for you then it might be safer to mark it as a HP/Xmen Xover. If you only include major ripoff characters sparingly or not at all you could get away with just using a summary tag and having it as a HP only fic.

You can't get away with not warning people about them up front. It can be a major turn off to be introduced to a major crossover unexpectedly. For the two fics I named knowing the source material does not significantly affect the enjoyment of the fic. If you didn't know who Chuck or James Bond were you could go about your day all the same, and those who knew would get a bit of extra appreciation.

For a major element like your OC characters they would most likely need upfront introduction or you will have a lot of upset readers in my opinion. This of course all depends on how relevant they are in your story.

Sorry for rambling, hope my point got across.
