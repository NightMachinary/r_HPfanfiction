Best is probably this... [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived]]\\
Extremely good writing, awesome new plot where Harry goes to Drumstrang to forge his own path... however, it looks like the author won't come back to finish it.\\
147k words so far/ 12 chapters. I would give it a try just to enjoy something really new and creative. I swear, this story would have been 10x better than the original...
