Ah yes, the STEROTYPES of the houses. You must be forgetting about slughorn (Slytherin) Neville (Gryffindor) Nymphadora Tonks (Hufflepuff) Cedric (Hufflepuff) Andromada Tonks (Slytherin) Peter Pettagrew (Gryffindor) Cho chang (Ravenclaw) Luna Lovegood (Ravenclaw) and litterally much more characters who dont comform to the stupid sterotypes you slapped on them.
