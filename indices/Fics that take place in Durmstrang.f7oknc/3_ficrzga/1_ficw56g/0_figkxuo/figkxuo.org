I didn't want this to come off as aggressive, but I didn't succeed, I guess. This is to people in general, not just you. Here are all the canon arguments that come to mind:

Have you read about Tonks? She's /awesome/ and definitely won't stand there and take it.

Ernie Macmillan turned the entire Hufflepuff house against Harry. One could argue he turned the entire school against him. (Basically, don't mess with a Hufflepuff.)

Cedric Diggory is no pushover. He is described more like a leader, in fact.

Pomona Sprout and many other Hufflepuffs fought in the Battle of Hogwarts.

Amelia Bones is said to have been a Hufflepuff. The head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. Not a position for someone who backs down in situations.
