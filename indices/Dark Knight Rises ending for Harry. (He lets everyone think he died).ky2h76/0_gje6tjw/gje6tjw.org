Harry felt as though he turned into slow motion: he saw McGonagall, Kingsley and Slughorn blasted backward, flailing and writhing through the air, as Voldemort's fury at the fall of his last, best lieutenant exploded with the force of a bomb, Voldemort raised his wand and directed it at Molly Weasley.

Harry rose his arm with a Shield Charm on his lips, but he hesitated. He thought of the fame he would get from defeating Voldemort twice, from coming back from the dead. He would never know a calm, peaceful life. He would be hounded by fans, paparazzi, and wannabe dark lords for the rest of his life. And worst of all, his kids, if they didn't get caught in the crossfire, could easily turn out as stuck up as Malfoy.

Harry knew, in that moment, that he needed to stay dead. Instead of the shield, he cast a silent disarming charm. He intentionally kept it weak, so that its color was muted enough to be nearly invisible, and its effect was subtle enough that no one but Voldemort himself would realize that his wand had jerked just enough to throw off his aim.

Harry's spell surprised Voldemort just enough that he was unable to react in time when Molly, who was still on an adrenaline high from killing Bellatrix, cursed him just as she had his servant, hitting him square in the chest.

Voldemort fell backward, arms splayed, the slit pupils of the scarlet eyes rolling upward. Tom Riddle hit the floor with a mundane finality, his body feeble and shrunken, the white hands empty, the snakelike face vacant and unknowing. Voldemort was dead, killed by Molly Weasley.

/Nineteen Years Later/

Autumn seemed to arrive suddenly that year. The morning of the thirtieth of August was crisp as an apple, and as the little family bobbed across the rumbling road toward an outdoor cafe, the fumes of car exhausts and the breath of pedestrians sparkled like cobwebs in the cold air. As the mother sat the son down at their chosen table, the redheaded girl trailed behind, clutching her father's arm.

"Just a few more days, and you'll be off to Hogwarts," Ron told her.

"I know," Rose replied. "I can't wait."

The parents stared wistfully across the cafe as the kids looked over menus and pedestrians passed by behind them. Hugo's voice drifted back to Ron over the surrounding clamor; his children had resumed the questioning they did every year.

"Why do we come here on holiday every year, Mum?"

"This place is...special to your father and me."

"It's just a cafe. What makes it so special?" Rose asked. "We know you never came to America before you got married."

"We'll explain when your older, dear."

Rose pouted for a few seconds before her eyes widened. "Wait. Was I conceived here?"

"/Rose!/" Hermione hissed. "That is /not/ appropriate to say in public."

Ron's attention drifted back across the cafe as his wife did her best to not explain what "conceived" meant to their son. His eyes landed on a black-haired man with the barest hint of a scar on his face as he and the beautiful woman with him got up to leave.

As their eyes met, they both smiled slightly, and the man gave Ron a small nod before turning away and taking the woman's hand.

Ron turned his attention back to his family who had brought him joy for nineteen years. All was well.
