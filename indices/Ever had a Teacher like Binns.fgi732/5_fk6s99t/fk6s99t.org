as far as we know: Magic History is the most boring subject, because Binns is more "monologing" his teachings, than actual teaching. As we learn in Book 5, he actually still thinks, he is teaching his old Class. His art of teaching is more robotic and thats why its so uninteresting. yet more of it: (atleast as far as i remember) Binns never asks the class if there are some Questions. He enters the Class, makes his teaching monologue and leaves without care. So, you could think he does a "deal with it or fail the exame" attitude, which is certainly great for some classes, but terrible in Human interaction.

​

Think of it as a Singer: the song can be good as hell, but if the singer has no good voice, its not good.

Imagine your interaction with him after the Chamber of secrets is exposed. He vehemently insistet that there would be proof or Hint of its existence. He is the same as Hermione, maybe even worse. So as long as there is no report in Books, it doesnt exist. But he seems to forget that Books are just a Media to transfer Knowledge over a Long Lifespan and that it saves the exploration, knowledge and History. But if no one makes further explorations, than there cant be any further reports.

Since he seems to be "trapped" in his timeline, i could imagine he would declare the existence of the CoS or "future knowledge" as fake, because it wasnt in "his" studies.

No, i never had a teacher like him.
