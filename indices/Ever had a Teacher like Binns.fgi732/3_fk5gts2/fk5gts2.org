Ooof

I could never have been a teachers pet, if anything I was like Fred and Geroge and I'm happy for that.

I was on behaviour report for the fifth time that school year and I was about to get of it when we had a supply for geography. My friends got paper and threw it around and had a paper war becuase the supply was so boring, she went on tangents about her family and had a really monotone voice

Anyway she gave me 5 crosses (which meant I got an hour detention for no reason) so I called her a fucking boring bitch and slammed the door...

And from then on I solemnly swear I turned good!
