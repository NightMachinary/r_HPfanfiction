Public law professor in my first year of university. Public law is basically "how your government works", so it wasn't the most scintillating of subjects to begin with (especially at the start when it was "this is the history of how the government was established"), but this lady. She would give out handouts of lecture notes-- and then stand up there and just read the notes out loud, in a very monotone voice.
