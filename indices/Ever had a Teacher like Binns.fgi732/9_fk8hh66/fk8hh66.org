I didn't get a Binns, but I got an Umbridge (Or a Snape, pick your poison)!

We had a supply teacher for maths, and she was the most obnoxious person I'd ever met.

In the class, we had to be DEAD SILENT. I mean dead silent. Not even a whisper. This really dampened the mood, because we were always allowed to talk. We always chatted during questions, and it never really affected our work, and we were top set students, none of us got there by slacking off. The dead silence was unsettling and boring, so people actually got LESS work done.

If we didn't know something, the teacher was a prick about it. First question asked, she told the asker that it was written on the board (it wasn't). 2nd question asked, she told them that you should already know. Third question asked, she got fed up and banned asking questions. We gave up on that.

Someone in my class, lets call her Tammy, got fed up. She started fidgeting, and then argued with the teacher 'Why stop us from talking? We always talk in math class, never stops us from\\
working at all'

The teacher gets angry at her. They argue back and forth until the teacher says 'Why are you even in this class!' Tammy walks out after that.

The teacher then walks around the class, insulting and telling off people for the smallest things, like uniform and work. She sets a oppressive mood.

My classmate, Sara, starts to feel upset. I could see the tears in her eyes. She ran out the classroom as well, using her exit card to make sure she doesn't get in trouble for it.

After the class ended, we called her the teacher from hell. I compared her to Umbridge, and we were all glad it ended. It was horrible. We insulted her behind her back, just like the people in HP did to Snape. Argh.
