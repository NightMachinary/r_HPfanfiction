I had a teacher like that for two years. In my 'high school' we had psychology classes that.many people wanted but only a third or so got. I was in one of those courses and our teacher was very nice, none of us had a problem with him, until he started to teach. Barely anyone paid attention. After summer vacation we came back and spirits were high - all of us had willingly chosen this course after all, and all of us wanted to learn. And then the teacher opened his mouth and started talking. It was almost comical how quickly everyone's enthusiasm fell.
