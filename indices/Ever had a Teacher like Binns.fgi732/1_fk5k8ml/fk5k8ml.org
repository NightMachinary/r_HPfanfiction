OMG, my meteorology professor had the most sonorous voice I've ever heard in my life. Deep and velvety and monotone and sooooo soothing. It was also the earliest class I ever took, not offered at any other time, and was required for my major. Dr. M put me to sleep during almost every lecture even though I was highly interested in the material. I still got 100% plus extra credit on every exam. I still remember most of what I learned about meteorology, probably because it is relevant every day of my life.
