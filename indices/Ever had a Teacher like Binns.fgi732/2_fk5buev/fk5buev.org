My managerial accounting professor is like the positive version of Binns. He has the most soothing voice I have ever heard and a slight danish accent, and combined with how mind numbingly boring the material is, I find it so difficult to stay alert. He's such a nice guy, and I feel so bad about it but I can't stay awake no matter how hard I try. It's gotten to the point where I've actually had to physically hold my eyelids open with my fingers.
