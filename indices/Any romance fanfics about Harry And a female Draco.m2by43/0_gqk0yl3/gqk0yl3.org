So, I realise this isn't all that much of a help, but I'm currently two thirds of the way through writing a Harry/Fem!Draco story.

The reason it isn't all that helpful is that it currently isn't published anywhere, and it's probably still at least a month away from posting as I'm being a good boy and writing my new fics to completion before I start posting them.

So, yeah. Sorry about that. Not aware of much in this space at all.
