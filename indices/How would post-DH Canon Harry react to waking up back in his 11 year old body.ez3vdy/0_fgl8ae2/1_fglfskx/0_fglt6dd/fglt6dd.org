Some authors really pervert that thought and have Harry arrange for the relationship between Lupin and Tonks, sometimes going as far as admitting that they were a bad match, but they have to do it +for the Greater Good+ so that Teddy exists and Harry can have his godson back. This completely ignores the fact that such a child would NOT be Teddy since it'd take the same sperm and egg, and the probability there is so slim that it's simply impossible. And that any child raised by its parents would probably turn out very differently than one raised by the widowed grandmother and an 18-year old veteran.
