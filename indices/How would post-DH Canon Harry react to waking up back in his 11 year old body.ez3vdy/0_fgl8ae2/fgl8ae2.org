I think it depends on how far past dh he is pulled from. By the conception of James he would probably be horrified to know he effectively wiped out it any chance at James ever existing, and this would increase with Albus and Lily. And he would probably be actively working on a way to get back home.

Prior to James being conceived he would likely be less tortured over it, but if other babies have already been born he might feel still conflicted over the loss of their existences, but would be more accepting of the time jump, and would more readily jump into fixing things.

If we're talking after dh but just before any births, I think he would only have (relatively) minor sadness, mostly personal sadness in regards to effectively losing all his relationships. He would most likely choose not to tell anyone that he time traveled, in the case of his generation, because they a they are all more or less babies to him and he would deliberately choose not to burden them with the knowledge of their shitty futures, and in the case of teachers because of a similar reason, but more just because he feels he wouldn't be taken seriously because they see /him/ as a baby. The exception to this I would say is Dumbledore. Harry knows Dumbledore has taken him at his word before, and he also knows Dumbledore had many ways to prove he's telling the truth, and he would consider it important to tell Dumbledore because Dumbledore has many long reaching plans that would be very effected by Harry being a time traveler. The second person I could see him telling is actually Snape, oddly enough. I think for one it would make Snape take him seriously and not treat him like a kid, and for two because he has understanding for the shit Snape went through, and the he would think Snape would appreciate knowing who won in the end. And also because Master Legilimens Snape will see into his mind like fucking glass anyways.

And as for /right after the end of dh/, well... It's similar to the one just above, but since harry is coming just out of realizing that Snape and Dumbledore, who are the only people he'd be willing to tell in the previous version, had been hiding a massive secret from him his whole life, I think he'd have some significant trust issues regarding those two. As in, go full in lone wolf, and tell no one that he's from the future, while immediately jumping into fixing things as soon as realizes this is permanent.

But in all of those scenarios, the one constant is that he would absolutely not tell Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Neville, so on and so forth, until either they find out or it's dragged out of him somehow. He would see them as tiny young innocent versions of his /very adult/ friends, and would make protecting them his top priority. This would include shielding them from the future, and he knows them well enough to know that if Hermione knew even just that he was from the future, that she wouldn't give it up until she knew what the future was like.

And finally, the last way it could pan out is also the most heartbreaking, which is the post-the /entirety/ of deathly hallows, /including the epilogue./ A full grown harry with three hogwarts(ish) aged children, a wife, a career, and an otherwise fully developed life, being forcibly yanked into his 11 year old body, for what appears to be forever, would result in a full on breakdown and a meeting with Dumbledore at first possible chance, to beg him for his help getting harry back to his time. If that's not possible, then you have Harry grieving the deaths of his three children all at once, while being completely isolated from everyone he loves, in a time when a very real and present threat is still alive. As for what happens after that, is anyone's guess...
