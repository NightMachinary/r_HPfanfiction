Haha. I came up with one earlier that might be halfway decent: Sicklehound. Goblins love silver (even enchant it), they, um, dig and stuff like a dog. Aaaaand that's about all the reasoning behind the potential name. xD

I might make it so that "Sicklehound" is the surname of the goblin that's the head of the 5th house, and so they just use his name for the new house as well (another of the commenters suggested this).
