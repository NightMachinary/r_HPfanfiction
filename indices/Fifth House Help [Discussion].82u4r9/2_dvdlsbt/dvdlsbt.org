Niffletrum: Niffle for niffler, since they burrow into the ground and like gold like goblins. Trum for rostrum, apparently the scientific name for a duck's bill/beak.

Flobberflop: For Flobberworms. It's a depressing name, but I thought it was amusing.

That's all I can really think of. Sorry if they're both terrible names xD
