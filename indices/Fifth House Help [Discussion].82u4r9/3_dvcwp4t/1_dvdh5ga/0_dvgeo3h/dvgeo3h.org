Sicklehound sounds cool. But none of the houses are named that directly after animals. Hufflepuff - ?? Gryffindor - derived from a magical animal Ravenclaw - named after the black talons of an eagle (her patronus) Slytherin - derived from the way a snake moves

Still it sounds cool, I think it's good.
