Actually, that might work on second thought (I didn't have a name for the Head just yet). I'm considering giving goblins surnames that wizards had ignored in favor of their epithets (real or imagined for them by wizards).

How does... /Sicklehound/ sound? Animal-y name, goblin-y too. Might settle for this if nothing else is to my liking, so thanks!
