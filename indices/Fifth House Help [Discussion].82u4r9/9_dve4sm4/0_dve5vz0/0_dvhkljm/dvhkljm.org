Goblins are known for their craftsmanship and attention to detail, as well as possessiveness, tenacity (character and physical grip), and pride. So there are overlaps with most of the houses in attributes. I'd probably focus on the crafting side, especially when introducing extra classes, think that could be really interesting.

You also need house colours that stand out among the existing colours- silver and gold would be good, or imperial purple captures their arrogance and sense of tradition.

I like the idea of a lemur as their house mascot - long fingers,good grip, used to low light levels, slightly goblin looking.

As for the name, Niffleheim (niffler plus norse mythology) or [goblin founder's name]wrought -eg Bodrodwrought. I think naming the house after themself shows the goblin pride in ownership nicely.

Sicklehound, while not sounding like a goblin name, sounds like the kind of nickname a non-goblin would give to a goblin. It would probably annoy the goblin, which might give you some more sources for tension in your story if you need it.

You can probably tell I've enjoyed thinking about this, so thanks for sharing your idea!
