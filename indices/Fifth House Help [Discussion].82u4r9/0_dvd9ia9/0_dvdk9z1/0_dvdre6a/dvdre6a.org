Hat announces that Harry is important and needs his own house. Hat sorts him and a bunch of girls there. Sometimes Fred and George get moved there by the hat too. Another table appears in the hall and they need a teacher as head of house. One of the young and friendly teachers (normally a woman) like Vector or Burbage gets the job. Everyone in the house loves each other so they get tons of house points. Quirrel gets defeated somehow that relies on teamwork. Story gets abandonned.
