What I mean is that Harry would be able to help magical architecture gain sentience/sapience

Or it could work similar to Parseltongue works in some fanfictions were Snakes gain sentience/sapience around a Parseltongue (and when snakes aren't around a Parseltongue they are just as intelligent as other non-magical animal although after meeting a Parseltongue some of the upgrades a snakes gets are permanent, with the longer a snakes is around a Parseltongue the more of there upgrades like increase intelligence become,permanent).

so any building Harry tries to talk to gains sentience/sapience and they longer Harry is around the building the more of the sentience/sapience the architecture would keep when Harry leaves. So Harry could talk to even non-magical building the way a Parseltongue can talk to any snake).
