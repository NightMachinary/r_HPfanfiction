One of the best, if not THE, examples of the Talk I've ever seen in fanfiction can be found in chapter sixteen of linkffn(The Bonds of Blood by Darth Marrs).

Here's it is:

Black looked at Harry. "Know what sex is?"

"Er, mostly."

"Do it before you're sixteen and I'll kick your ass."

"Oh, okay."
