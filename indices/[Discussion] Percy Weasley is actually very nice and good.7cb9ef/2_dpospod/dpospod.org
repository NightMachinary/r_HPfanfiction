Right? I have for years maintained that Percy is my second favourite Weasley. ( and that Fred and George are at the very least annoying, if not worse...)

He is a mostly reasonable, protective guy. He is clever, though I think his high marks are more due to determinenation than pure raw intelligence. He is brave. I mean, he decided that the ministry was right and stood against his own family. People like to see this as a horrible betrayal. I don't. I see it as being naive, maybe, easily misled, but also as brave. Standing up against something your whole family believes in, knowing this will cause a rift and still doing it. In a way that is a very Weasley thing to do, too. - and then the poor kid was kinda stuck ( because, he /is/ a kid! He is not older than your typical college student... Who does not make mistakes at that age?) .

i have a lot of thoughts about Percy. I think he is more similar to Ron than Ron would like to admit. I think he has the same " I am just another Weasley... And poor, too" insecurities, but deals with them in a different way. Ron dreams about standing out ( mirror of Erised) , Percy is actually working on it.

And then Percy in other ways is similar to Hermione, despite them not being related. Somebody who probably came to Hogwarts a bit on the know-it-all side, somebody who has problems making friends and who relies heavily on authority. Hermione was "pushed" into the position of having friends, of realising early you cannot always rely on those in authority (several teachers throughout the years trying to kill her best friend and working with Voldemort, Lockhard pulling the wool over her eyes so completely, McGonagall not taking them serious towards the end of book one...) . Percy did not have this happening to him that directly, in a way was allowed to take his time to grow up in that regard.

I get why people dislike Pecy. I just don't. I really always liked him.
