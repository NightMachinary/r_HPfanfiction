I think you just aren't viewing things from the proper perspective, because you already know the truth as observed from Harry's POV. If your little brother's best friend suddenly started making public statements about Adolf Hitler coming back from the dead and murdering his fellow student, it wouldn't matter how much you liked or respected the kid. You would think he's lost his mind.

It's made apparent all throughout the series that there /are/ hard limits on what magic can and cannot do (Gamp's Laws, etc.), and for most people in the HP universe, it's as inconceivable that Voldemort came back from the dead as Hitler's resurrection would be for us.
