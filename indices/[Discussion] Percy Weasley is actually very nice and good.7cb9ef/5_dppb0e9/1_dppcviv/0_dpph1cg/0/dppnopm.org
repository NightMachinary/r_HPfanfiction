  started making public statements about Adolf Hitler coming back from the dead and murdering his fellow student

Exactly. It's not just wild stories and statements; there's a dead fucking student whose death was NOT investigated. There's Barty Crouch Jr who was kissed on sight, despite being a potential goldmine of information. There's the trouble at the World Cup. There's the dementor attack on Harry. Percy was at least peripherally aware of all those things but he chose to ignore them and side with the Ministry regardless.

As I mentioned in my previous post, I'm not saying he should have believed Harry out of hand. But before sending that letter, the very least he could have done, would be visit Harry and get his side of the story, so that he could judge for himself.
