I'd maybe put more faith and standing in my parents opinions, plus he must've known about the diary being Riddle's. That should've informed his opinion. Fact is, Percy resented being the 3rd child, couldn't live up to the reputation of bill and Charlie so strives to make a name for himself. Hated being poor and (granted, this is an assumption) put a lot of stock in the ministry and thought by succeeding there he was a good person. He said some awful stuff to his parents and admitted he was a fool in DH.

I don't think Percy is a bad person, but he is by far the worst Weasley.
