Yes, thank you.

I mean, it's one thing to believe the Prophet shit if you haven't met the guy - but Percy shared quarters for three years with Harry, even had time to observe him as a guest in the Weasley home.

I'm not saying he should have believed Harry's story out of hand, but he didn't even give him the benefit of doubt, didn't try to talk to him and get his version of events, just swallowed the ministry propaganda like candy.

It feels a lot like he chose to remain on the ministry's side out of self-interest, to advance his career.
