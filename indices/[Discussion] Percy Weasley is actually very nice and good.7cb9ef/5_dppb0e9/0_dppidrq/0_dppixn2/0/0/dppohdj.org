Oh I remember, but that doesn't excuse his behaviour towards his family for pretty much 3 whole books. Now I get that he had to be careful in book 7, but he still was awful to his family in OotP and HBP. Even if the letter he wrote was â€˜coded', it still a) was to get Ron to agree with him and stay away from Harry (I seriously doubt he cares about harry) and b) doesn't excuse the ignoring of his family and the stuff he said to them.

Look, I read Percy as a know it all and pompous, and someone who values status from the establishment over his family. Something I personally can't stand. Anyone who would reprimand his family and not support them (at a boarding school no less) and was seemingly embarrassed by his family's status is not a character that will ever be one of my favourites. You clearly like him, and have a higher opinion of him that I ever will.
