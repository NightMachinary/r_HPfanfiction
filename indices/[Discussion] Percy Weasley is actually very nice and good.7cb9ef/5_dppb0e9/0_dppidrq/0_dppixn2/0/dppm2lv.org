So it is a letter that is totally out of character to anyone who actually knows him but looks genuine to people who superficially are acquainted with him, written by a person who finds himself trapped behind enemy lines and so plays lip service to the party line because everything else would be tantamount to social, financial and career (possibly even actual, considering the way the ministry moved against Dumbledore) suicide.

In other word, he wrote a letter that he tried to get past his censors.

His failure was that he expected Harry and his brother to be as smart as he himself is. Instead they were blinded by their emotions and did not read any further than the superficial wording.

Do remember how empty of content the letters were he received over the summer because people worried that they would be intercepted.

Do remember That earlier in the same chapter with Percy's letter Harry himself attempted to do what Percy did and encode a hidden message while making it seem harmless and innocent in his letter to Sirius.

JKR announced what she was doing with Percy's letter in the very same chapter it is printed in.
