Percy is actually one of my favourite characters and I hate it when the fandom bashes him or when he's just pushed aside in fanfiction. I always saw a lot of myself in Percy, I too have had high expectations put on me since I was a kid. I've often been referred to as “the saving grace of the family” and pressured to always be the best. I can never find much non-bashing fanfiction about Percy and I wish I could find more.
