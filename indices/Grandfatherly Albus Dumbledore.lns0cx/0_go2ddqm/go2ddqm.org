[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29158347/chapters/71584359][Hold the Line]] has amazingly written Minerva & Albus friendship. It's the best unexpected fic of 2021 I read so far. Absolutely gorgeous. I recommended this before in the What are you reading post. Minerva centric. Albus seen through her eyes is great.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29439321][The Ballad of the Sugar Plum Fairy]] is a full Albus fic. Funny, angsty, AU. I didn't like it as much as the first fic but it's written well and doesn't have any of the manipulative bashing tropes.

OP if you liked a specific fic in the past, I can see if there's anything in my bookmarks matching your tastes.
