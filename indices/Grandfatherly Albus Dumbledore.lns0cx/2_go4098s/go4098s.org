One Fanfic that i can highly recommend is: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13438181/1/The-Arcanist-Unspeakable-Mysteries][The Arcanist: Unspeakable Mysteries]]

WARNING! This Fanfic is in no way what you might expect from a Harry potter Fanfic. for example while we might return to Hogwards in the future we have only seen it in the first chapter, after which this story goes Completly on its own track.

In this Fanfic we have demons of different planes, gods, the different worlds of Nordic religion, Elfs, Dwarves and Mindflayers. with harry and Albus in the middle of it all.

​

as for the relationship between Harry and Albus - they start of as more or less a mentor student relationship, although Harry does already have a great amount of knowledge, in some areas even more so than Dumbledore.\\
Throughout the story the relationship between harry and albus changes to a pretty great friendship.

​

another plus for this story is that the author is really inventive in what he portrays and even includes some really great Original Characters, of which some are the support cast for the journey that Harry and Albus take to reach the realm of the elves.
