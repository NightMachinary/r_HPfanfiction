WARNING WALL OF TEXT INCOMING

​

As for how did harry get so knowledgeable... well his parents are alive and he lives with them in potter manor and for old families like the potters its normal that when you gain special knowledge it is put in the family pensive.For some reason that i cant remember lily and james didnt really care much about what harry did so he spend most of his time in the lnbrary where the pensive is stored and he did go through the memories on magic of most of his ancestors and read a great many books.in this story there are "unspeakable mysteries/secrets" for example the reality that demons exist and could tear down the world on a whim.

a long time in the past midgard/earth was cut of from all the other realms besides some special secret passages as to protect the humans from demons.Problem with the demons is that if you do not have special sigils inscribed to your soul you will just go mad and lose your soul should you even see a demon.

because of the pensive memories harry learned of these unspeakable mysteries and learned how to inscribe sigils in his soul to protect him/ strengthen his magic/body/mind and so on.

chapter one, enter riddle possesing someone and summoning a demon and by doing that punch a hole in the protection around midgard.

harry and dumbledore somehow manage to kill the demon (enormously strong by human standards jet still a small fry of only the 4th (?) cycle of hell).

Doing that marks their souls for all of demon kind. now they want to kill them for the insult of an ant killing a god.

​

in hope of getting the inscription on their souls removed and to gain allies now that demons will gradually be able to gain entrance to earth, harry and dumbledore try to find their way to the elves in Alfheim, as they are known to hunt and kill demons for sports.
