Yes... ended as in there weren't any more chapters, I did mention it was unfinished and I didn't know whether or not it was still uploading, I didn't spend a huge amount of time trying to word the fact that the idea was being shown towards the end of what was currently uploaded and I didn't get to see it really explored yet because there were no more chapters after that but it's not finished yet and may or may not still be updating. It really holds about no importance to my post at all, I could have left that entire part out and am slightly starting to question myself for not doing so lol

tl;dr my bad it was confusing/misleading, I didn't think it was important
