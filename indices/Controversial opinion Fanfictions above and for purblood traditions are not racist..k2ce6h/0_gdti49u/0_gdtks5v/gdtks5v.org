  First of all, I doubt that thinking that "All the Muggleborns are descendant of wizards, often by a Squibb line" is not a controversial opinion on this sub. I think it's even the most popular opinion concerning the existence of Muggleborn (and pretty much the only "logical one" that does not go full mystical).

I just want to add that it's basically impossible for this not to be the case, just from a genetic/historical point of view. Muggles and magicals were living together for thousands of years before the Statute of Secrecy. You only have to go back a few hundred years for pretty much everyone with European ancestry to be related. Even if the magicals mostly kept to themselves, there would still be enough crossover for everyone to have /some/ magic in their ancestry.
