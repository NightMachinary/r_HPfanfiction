  First of all, I doubt that thinking that "All the Muggleborns are descendant of wizards, often by a Squibb line" is not a controversial opinion on this sub.
#+end_quote

I give it to you, that it is a widespread opinion, but to be honest, most time's I have seen it brought up in this Sub, it was certainly followed by comments, who criticize that it is wrong to think so, because you supports the death eater opinion that magic cannot come from muggle. Which is right and wrong at the same time, since yes, that's my opinion, but the death eaters believe muggleborns steal magic.

  Pretty much all the fanfics I have read that talked about "Pureblood culture" ended up "whitewashing" the Death Eaters.
#+end_quote

Here I have to give you another point, as this really affects a large part of fanfiction, but I find that if it is, it is set up correctly, and not just in 'whitewashing' ends, one can use purblood culture to give the 'bad guys' more depth than "they're bad". Since we didn't get any real insight into the purblood culture in the books, or into society in general, outside of Hogwarts, it is up to you to create this yourself.

  "Oh Draco was mean to Harry but only because he refused to shake his hand and it's a very bad insult in Pureblood Culture."
#+end_quote

To be honest, if we assume that Draco thought Harry would know about traditions, customs, and rules; "Which would be understandable, since Harry is a public figure after all and should therefore have received some tips if you want to avoid this happening." it wouldn't be wrong for him to react like that, especially since himself likely was raised with these, and he is 11; "With 11 I could be angry with my best friend, cause he didn't remember our secret handshake, what naturally only could happen, because he wasn't as interested as I in our friendship." and you aren't exactly known for your understanding or the capability to think things through with 11. And to be honest even without purblood society, it's not hard to understand young Draco, and it's not exactly as if he alone was at fault, but all that doesn't mean, that I can't also totally say, that he was a spoiled brat, who let this children conflict deteriorate, and was an asshole to Harry and Hermione, Ron is different, because unlike young Harry and Hermione, he also antagonized Malfoy, mind you it was certainly not half as bad, as what Malfoy did, but still more than the other two. So it is not really whitewashing, even if it is often use as jumping board into mindlessly whitewashing.

"The Malfoy are not mean to the Weasleys because they are poor and unbigoted, but because they don't respect Pureblood Culture...

So far it would be logical, and above all no whitewashing, it's just one reason why they behave like that, and even with the rest of the example;

#+begin_quote
  ...and were very disrespectfull to them first.
#+end_quote

It's still no whitewashing, as even if the Malfoys behave, like they do, because of the stated reasons, it would still be wrong. So it kinda is the same like the first example, it is no whitewashing, but as your next sentence shows it is easily, and often, misused for such.

  "Oh the Death Eater are not that bad, they are just afraid to see Pureblood Culture disappear after years of forced change brought by the Old Goat Dumbledore to help his pet Mudbloods. They just decided to rise to protect themselves so they are the good guys (even though their answer is a genocide).
#+end_quote

Ok here I can't argue much, it is straight whitewashing.

#+begin_quote
  Pureblood don't celebrate Muggle celebration like Christmas, they follow the Pagan Gods and celebrate All Hallows Eve, Yull or Beltane, which make them so connected with their Magic and better than others (ignore the fact that People like Draco are present during the Halloween feast of Hogwarts, that Wizards separated from Muggle during the XVIIIth century, a good Millenium after the "death" of Pagan gods, or that Pagan religions are pretty much as Muggle as Christianism)".
#+end_quote

Ok here I can argue, that it maybe only a recent thing, that it is Halloween or Christmas, instead of Samhein (All Hallows Eve is the Christian thing as it it means the Evening before All Saint's Day) or Yule, because these two, like most christian holidays are on the same date as these pagan holidays. And that it is simply a cosmetic change; "Like saying happy holidays, instead of merry christmas, in the western world." to ease muggleborns into the new culture. As outside of Hogwarts, the only holiday we see is celebrated by the Weasleys, it's not as if we know, if more traditional families celebrate Yule.

Also to be honest, even if the Wizards separated from the Muggles in 1689, that was, if we take the year of norman conquest, plus some 50 to 100 years for the last remnants, 500 to 600 years after pagan religions ceased to exist for muggles, but for wizards? I mean if you are Wizard of Witch from a purblood family, would you switch to a religion which says, that you should kill all witches(Ex 22,17)?

But as interesting as these discussion about religion would be, the thing I wanted to state to this example is, that it simply isn't an example of whitewashing. It is a specific worldbuild you don't like.

  The fact that the Magical Culture is pretty close to the Muggle one doesn't mean that it doesn't exist. Country like France and Belgium (or USA/ Canada) have a pretty similar culture, but they still have their difference and nobody would say they have the same.
#+end_quote

Yeah your right, but firstly there are a tad bit greater discrepancies, even if we let the implications of magic out of the quotation. As an example house elves, most common use trope for slavery besides they are happy, is they need it to life, but why? Easy, because for us the owning of a sentient being is only possible with a explonation, for the magical it's a part of life, same with freedom of the press, the prophet as most read newspaper, shouldn't have to bow before the minister. There are many such points, and let's not forget the contempt or at least disregard, most magicals shows towards muggles. Understandable considering the past, human nature (we would not react positive if we find out) and the fact, that for a magical who lives with magic, it simply isn't possible to imagine living without, like for us with electricity.
