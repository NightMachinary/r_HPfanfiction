  Also to be honest, even if the Wizards separated from the Muggles in 1689, that was, if we take the year of norman conquest, plus some 50 to 100 years for the last remnants, 500 to 600 years after pagan religions ceased to exist for muggles, but for wizards? I mean if you are Wizard of Witch from a purblood family, would you switch to a religion which says, that you should kill all witches(Ex 22,17)

What? Christianity didn't arrive in Britain with the Norman Conquest! Christianity was brought to Britain by the Romans, and made "official" by Emperor Augustus in around 600 AD. By the 800's, Christianity was absolutely the dominant religion in Britain.

Christianity was the official religion of Britain 400 years before the Normans arrived, and for around 1100 years before the Statute of Secrecy was brought in. There was a specific brand of "Celtic Christianity" in both GB and Ireland that merged Christian practices with the existing ones, such as dating Easter from the Spring Equinox rather than using the Hebrew calendar, monks cutting their hair in the same way as the Celtic priests had to distinguish themselves from the monks tied to the church in Rome, and indeed the monastic practice itself which was at odds with the bishop led practices in the wider Christian world and providing a link with the land and nature that was similar to what we would now call Druidic practice. Up until the Reformation, the Church in England remained a distant satellite of Rome and was often left to its own devices meaning very specific local practices sprung up. Christianity in Britain by the time of the Statute had been there for a thousand years and was strongly influenced by local character, practices, and history.

Witchcraft was not made a specific crime in the UK until the late 1500s, and the witch-hunts here lasted for around five years begining circa 1645 - this leading to the development of the Statute of Secrecy in the late 1600s in Potterverse history. There is absolutely no logical reason that, until the persecution of witches began (around 900-1000 years after the introduction of Christianity), magical people in Britain and Ireland would have had any need to live separately or worship differently to the wider populous. And due to that, it makes absolute sense that magical people in modern Britain would actually double down on following Christian practices - they belong to their history as much as ours and how dare the muggles bastardise it and take it from them with violence?

Oh, and by the way, Exodus 22:17 doesn't say "kill all witches." It says /"If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins."/ It's Exodus 22:18 that states /"it is not permissable for a sorceress to live,"/ and that is translated from old Greek now thought to mean potioneer or herbalist - advice that was hugely overlooked and ignored in Britain up until the Reformation, as many communities relied on their local "wise woman" for basic medical care and her knowledge of medicinal herbs.
