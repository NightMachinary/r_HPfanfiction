  What? Christianity didn't arrive in Britain with the Norman Conquest! Christianity was brought to Britain by the Romans, and made "official" by Emperor Augustus in around 600 AD. By the 800's, Christianity was absolutely the dominant religion in Britain.

Didn't say that it arrived with the conquest, but that with the conquest, the last remnants i.e norse paganism, slowly began to die.

  It's Exodus 22:18 that states "it is not permissable for a sorceress to live," and that is translated from old Greek
#+end_quote

Firstly, in the german bible and hebrew original it's 22:17 and states "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live" also there are more parts wo codem magic. Also as it's the old testament, it was written in hebrew, so it isn't true that it is translated from old Greek, only the new testament is.

  Witchcraft was not made a specific crime in the UK until the late 1500s,

But cases existet and the first period of Witch trials was in the 1400s, and the law was the bible and the Malleus Maleficarum.

  And due to that, it makes absolute sense that magical people in modern Britain would actually double down on following Christian practices

Its what you think, for me abandonment of any existing ties with christianity is more plausible, especially, when you remember, that it's written in the guidebook to not be magical in like these few parts: "Old testament 2 Mose 22:18; 3 Mose 19:31; 5 Mose 18:9-12; 3 Mose 20:27; 3 Mose 20:6; 5 Mose 18:10; Gal 5:20-21; Jes 8:19; Gal 5:19-21; 1 Sam 15:23; 2 Kin 21:6; 1 Chr 10:13-14; 2 Chr 33:6 New testament Rev 21:8; Rev 22:15; Acts 19:19"

All locations of this parts are from the Luther Bible.

I didn't wanted to talk religion, I didn't wanted it.
