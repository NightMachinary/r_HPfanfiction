Thing is, in the context of discussing societal development, even a hypothetical one such as this, religion isn't a personal matter due to its historical influence on society. It certainly wasn't a personal matter at the time we are discussing, as the influence it had on public policy shows. The whole point in canon of the Statute was to protect magicals from persecution, and it was religious people across Europe who persecuted witches. The point of people bringing religion up in this discussion is nothing to do with an individual's religious or spiritual preference, but how religion has shaped society through history and how, hypothetically, this would have affected magical customs compared with Muggle ones.

  Yeah sorry I thought, that it would be the same in all languages, as in the original text. And as I am an Atheist, it's a archivement that I read one version of the bible.

I'm an atheist too, but I've read the Bible as a historical document. Not just in terms of what it can tell us about the time it was written, but also the rewrites and translations that change meaning as time passes, often deliberately to suit the religious prejudices and practices of the time. The development of the church as a form of social control is almost separate to the study of the Bible, as much of the Bible has been twisted to reflect what the church wanted to achieve, rather than the church shaping itself around the original word of the Bible. I think that's particularly pertinent in terms of witchcraft and the persecution of (predominantly) women.
