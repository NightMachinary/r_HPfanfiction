  Didn't say that it arrived with the conquest, but that with the conquest, the last remnants i.e norse paganism, slowly began to die.

Christianity was the dominant force by 800 AD, and any paganism (paganism being taken to mean any non Christian monotheistic belief system) that existed from the 5th century onwards was, as you've said, either Anglo-Saxon or Norse, not Celtic - and it's neopaganism with its faux-celtic roots that most fics have the purebloods doing. There are still massive remnants of Norse and Anglo Saxon paganism in modern Britain and the way we approach our culture, including how the Church operates. Celtic paganism was lost to history by about 500AD, whatever modern practitioners of Wicca would have you believe. This is a common mistake made by people when developing a "pureblood culture" for their fic.

  Firstly, in the german bible and hebrew original it's 22:17 and states "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live" also there are more parts wo codem magic. Also as it's the old testament, it was written in hebrew, so it isn't true that it is translated from old Greek, only the new testament is.

I don't know if this is true as I've never read the German Bible, but the discussion /you started/ is about pureblood wizarding culture etc in wizarding Britain, so it's the UK stuff that's relevant and in all English translation of the Bible, it's 22;18.

The Old Testament was also translated into Greek for export elsewhere. The Septuagint, the original translation out of Hebrew for use by the Catholic Church, was into Old Greek from Hebrew, in order to bring it in line with the New Testament which was mainly originally scribed in Greek. So the majority of translation of the Old Testament into European languages does indeed come from the Greek, as for years the only version made accessible by the Catholic Church was the Septuagint and translations thereof.

  But cases existet and the first period of Witch trials was in the 1400s, and the law was the bible and the Malleus Maleficarum.
#+end_quote

The Maleficarum had much less influence in England than mainland Europe. The "law" in the UK was not just the Bible, Common Law in England began in 1066, and the upholders of the law at that time were barons and the king. It is a legal system that is robust, based on precedent and case law, and by 1154 was codified across the nation removing local peculiarities and influences, including to an extent that of the church. In the mid 1550s, Elizabeth I was queen and she had a court wizard, John Dee. Herbalism and so on was broadly accepted practice by all but the most devoted Christians. There was no capital law against witchcraft in the UK until the 1560s and tbh the witch trials here were minor compared to other European countries - we only really had a couple of years of "witch fever" and less than 150 people were put to death under the laws. Many of our most restrictive witchcraft laws were repealed in the 1730s, when it was actually made a crime to /accuse/ someone of witchcraft, and the last "official" execution of a "witch" was in 1685.

  I didn't wanted to talk religion, I didn't wanted it.

So why mention it then? It really annoys me when people do this, they say something that isn't correct and then try to shut down discussion. Any theoretical or hypothetical discussion of "wizarding culture" and how it would have developed if real has to take into account religion, because religion, in most countries across the planet, is the main driving force of culture and the shape of society.
