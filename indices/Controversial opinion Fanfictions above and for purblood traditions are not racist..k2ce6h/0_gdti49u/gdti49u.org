First of all, I doubt that thinking that "All the Muggleborns are descendant of wizards, often by a Squibb line" is not a controversial opinion on this sub. I think it's even the most popular opinion concerning the existence of Muggleborn (and pretty much the only "logical one" that does not go full mystical).

As for the existence of a "Pureblood culture and traditions". I do not think the problem lies with the idea itself (which is pretty fine, and maybe even logical), but rather how it is treated in Fanfictions. Pretty much all the fanfics I have read that talked about "Pureblood culture" ended up "whitewashing" the Death Eaters.

- "Oh Draco was mean to Harry but only because he refused to shake his hand and it's a very bad insult in /Pureblood Culture/."
- "The Malfoy are not mean to the Weasleys because they are poor and unbigoted, but because they don't respect /Pureblood Culture/ and were very disrespectfull to them first. The Weasleys are the bad guys there".
- "Oh the Death Eater are not that bad, they are just afraid to see Pureblood Culture disappear after years of forced change brought by the Old Goat Dumbledore to help his pet Mudbloods. They just decided to rise to protect themselves so they are the good guys (/even though their answer is a genocide/).
- Pureblood don't celebrate *Muggle* celebration like Christmas, they follow the Pagan Gods and celebrate All Hallows Eve, Yull or Beltane, which make them so connected with their Magic and better than others (ignore the fact that People like Draco are present during the Halloween feast of Hogwarts, that Wizards separated from Muggle during the XVIIIth century, a good Millenium after the "death" of Pagan gods, or that Pagan religions are pretty much as Muggle as Christianism)".

We are talking about fanfictions, so the fact that this is not Canon Compliant is not a problem at all, but I often find a little racism undertone is this kind of story which make me dislike them and be wary of the idea in general. I also want to add than Canon *has* a Pureblood Culture, or rather a Magical one. Wizards have their own food, their own art, their own sports . . . The fact that the Magical Culture is pretty close to the Muggle one doesn't mean that it doesn't exist. Country like France and Belgium (or USA/ Canada) have a pretty similar culture, but they still have their difference and nobody would say they have the same.
