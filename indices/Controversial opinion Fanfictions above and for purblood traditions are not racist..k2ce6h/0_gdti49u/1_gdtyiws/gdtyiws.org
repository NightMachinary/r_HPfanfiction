To be fair, Draco basically used the culture argument in Madame Malkins when he first met Harry:

#+begin_quote
  "I really don't think they should let the other sort in, do you? *They're just not the same, they've never been brought up to know our ways.* Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, I imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families."
#+end_quote

The implication is that muggle-borns shouldn't be let into Hogwarts because they---at least to the Malfoys---don't understand wizarding culture. Rowling obviously forgot this decent argument and went straight for the easy yet braindead Nazi metaphor to strip the pure-blood supremacists of any credibility, but it says a lot that an eleven year old Draco made a much more solid argument for not liking muggle-borns than any character in the HP series until Fantastic Beasts explored Grindelwald's ideals deeper. Grindelwald was a good villain because while his argument is credible, its the mass slaughter and desired enslavement of Muggles what truly make him evil. If Grindelwald's ideals were just completely wrong like the Death Eaters or Umbridge, it would make him a less threatening villain in-universe since his ideals could be effortlessly debunked.

Yes, Draco was present during the Halloween feast, but I find it hard to believe that no cultural distinction between normal pure-bloods and the blood traitors. Are we as the readers expected to believe the Weasley family is representative of normal wizards, let alone pure-blood? They're looked down by basically every pure-blood family for being Muggle lovers, not just merely tolerating Muggles---the Weasleys' view on Muggles is the complete opposite of the Malfoy family, but no less extreme.

Contrary to popular belief, the Weasleys would not be teaching Harry all about pure-blood culture---nor would Dumbledore for that matter. Why? Because they are blood traitors who reject the notion of blood purity, whereas the average wizards would have more in common with Fudge. People like Dumbledore and Arthur are radicals, whereas Fudge and Slughorn reflect a far more accurate portrayal of the average wizards---they greatly value blood purity, magical heritage and the "old ways", but also oppose discrimination against muggle-borns.

Even Hagrid says that Harry would be a powerful wizard since his mum and dad were powerful, something that couldn't be said about muggle-borns. Its an argument that would have been portrayed negatively if someone like Draco, or Lucius, or Umbridge had implied wizards with powerful magical ancestry were better at magic than those without... yet that idea is what wizarding culture runs off of.

*TL;DR: Draco made the wizarding culture argument in PS. Harry wouldn't learn pure-blood culture from anyone affiliated with Dumbledore or his ideals. The Weasleys are nowhere close to normal pure-bloods. Fudge and Slughorn are the best examples of what normal wizards---those unaffiliated with Dumbledore or Voldemort's extreme ideals--- truly believe about the wizarding world, magical heritage, or Muggles.*
