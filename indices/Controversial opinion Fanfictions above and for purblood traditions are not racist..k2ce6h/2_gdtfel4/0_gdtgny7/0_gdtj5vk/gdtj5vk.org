OP was the one who compared it to Saudi Arabia in the first place. Also, I do think they can be compared. The treatment of magical creatures is horrendous. They basically have no rights whatsoever. The wizarding world has overly harsh punishments (even petty criminals end up in Azkaban), and their judicial system is corrupt. They seem to only have one major newspaper, and all of the information there is controlled by the Ministry. There is a total lack of separation of powers, since Umbridge is a judge, a lawmaker, an undersecretary, and a headmistress at the same time.

Even the seemingly harmless traditions such as the pagan holidays and family magic are pretty horrible. Fanfics usually have pureblood whining about how their rituals and spells are labeled as dark magic, when the reason is probably because of the destructive potential. It's unsafe for an eleven year old to learn a spell that blows up a whole street or a ritual that can be extremely dangerous when performed incorrectly. It's the same reason there are gun control laws.
