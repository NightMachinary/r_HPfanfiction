There's a difference between perfume and extremely dangerous dark magic. That's like saying that because there are gun control laws, there will be laws controlling everything in your life.

I do agree that the Ministry is way too authoritarian and corrupt, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't be able to heavily control dangerous and unknown magic. If they didn't, the wizarding world would be pure chaos. Imagine if Draco was able to learn a spell from his parents that scarred Hermione permanently. The Ministry may be corrupt, but even a broken clock is right twice a day.
