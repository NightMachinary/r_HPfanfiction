where do we put the limit on what family developed magic the ministry gains access too, would that include potions to fix your hair, perfumes or something alike that.

The ministry we saw in canon in no way should have more power than they already has, the minister has the capaicty execute pepole without due process, bury said execution and go on to influence the national news paper to run a smear campaign against a traumatized 14-15 year old. It was filled with terrorists or bigots that would go on to abuse said power.
