  Our problem here is to be honest that Rowling fucked up worldbuilding. We don't know if there are real reasons or not, are the majority of the Werewolves more like Lupin or Greyback, if the latter is true, we would open Hunting Season, so...

Well, although the few of them we've seen besides Lupin seem to be criminals in some way, we know that all the good guys support them. I think we're supposed to give them the benefit of the doubt, and assume that the only reason a lot of them are evil is because they were bitten as children and indoctrinated.

  While I understand from where you come, what makes you believe that a separation of power is needed?
#+end_quote

I'm not saying that it's needed. Many perfectly fine countries don't practice it. The thing is, the Ministry is overly authoritarian and controls /everything./ The Minister's undersecretary being on the Wizengamot is just icing on the cake.

  Why?

Usually the family magic and pagan rituals are very dangerous. As said before, if a pureblood messes up the ritual or spell, it's extremely dangerous. Since the spells and rituals are usually very hidden from the general public unlike regular magic, they probably can't be easily healed and would be extremely hard to defend against. With regular magic, the danger is greatly reduced since it's widely known, and the truly dangerous magic can only be performed after years of study.

  In most fanfics it is not about 11 olds learning it, but grown ups, and as you can see in the USA people understandable don't like it, when the government takes power away, and it's even more understandable, when this power maybe inventions of ancestors (family spells).

In most of the fanfics I've seen, it's about a school-aged Harry learning it. But, in the end, I don't think the age really matters. Unknown and lethal magic should be heavily controlled. Maybe it shouldn't be banned, but the Ministry can't let random people perform rituals nobody knows about. What if they or someone else got hurt? The Healers wouldn't be able to help them. For example, when Hermione invented the SNEAK spell and used it on Marietta, those pimples never fully healed for the rest of Marietta's life, and no one could help her since it was an unknown spell. Of course, I understand many people don't like the government policing what they can do, but I think the Ministry is right in not allowing everyone to cast random magic.
