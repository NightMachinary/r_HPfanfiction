Yeah simply for the fact, that it was the first Country which came to my Mind of having vast Cultural differences. And while I stand behind you when you say that there is a lot to criticize about Saudi-Arabia, when I ask you if you want to live there, what's your answer? No, probably.

  The treatment of magical creatures is horrendous. They basically have no rights whatsoever.

Our problem here is to be honest that Rowling fucked up worldbuilding. We don't know if there are real reasons or not, are the majority of the Werewolves more like Lupin or Greyback, if the latter is true, we would open Hunting Season, so...

  There is a total lack of separation of powers, since Umbridge is a judge, a lawmaker, an undersecretary, and a headmistress at the same time.

While I understand from where you come, what makes you believe that a separation of power is needed? Only because for us it's the better thing doesn't makes it universal. You should read about cultural relativism. Because you forget, that other than in relation to normal human cultures, and even there it is not always appropriate to simply think that the western culture, values, etc. are the good ones, with magic there is a society, in stark contrast to our, as there a possibilities a normal human simply doesn't have.

  Even the seemingly harmless traditions such as the pagan holidays and family magic are pretty horrible.

Why?

  Fanfics usually have pureblood whining about how their rituals and spells are labeled as dark magic, when the reason is probably because of the destructive potential. It's unsafe for an eleven year old to learn a spell that blows up a whole street or a ritual that can be extremely dangerous when performed incorrectly. It's the same reason there are gun control laws.

In most fanfics it is not about 11 olds learning it, but grown ups, and as you can see in the USA people understandable don't like it, when the government takes power away, and it's even more understandable, when this power maybe inventions of ancestors (family spells).
