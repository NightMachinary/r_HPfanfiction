If the wizarding world is like a separate country, why should their traditions not be criticized? Using your example of Saudi Arabia, they should be called out on their disgusting treatment of women, their arrests of nonviolent activists, their cruel punishments, their frequent use of torture, the fact that they're a hotspot for human trafficking victims (a lot of women are kidnapped and forced into marriages or sexual slavery with Saudi men), their lack of freedom of religion, their blatant anti-semitism in their media, their lack of basic human rights, their punishment of those accused of magic or witchcraft, their lack of freedom of press, their criminalization of homosexuality, and much more. They should not be excused because "that's just how they do it". Every country has flaws, but instead of just handwaving them away, we should try to fix them.
