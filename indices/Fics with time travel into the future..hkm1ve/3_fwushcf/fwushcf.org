Um, Browncoat, Green Eyes. Sort of? This is the firefly crossover somebody else mentioned. linkffn(2857962)

Another option would be Balancing Destinies (also sort-of), but you need to read Altered Destinies first (which is backwards time travel). So, he goes to the 30s in the first instalment, builds a family, and returns to his original time 10yrs later to a completely different world and all his kids grown up with kids/grandkids of their own. Warning: first couple chapters of AD is rough AF, but it turns into a great fic. Also blatantly ignores some canon things because it's pre-DH (and pre-HBP too I believe). Pity the sequel is incomplete. linkffn(3155057; 4150901)
