I get you. Those are good, but usually they end with people staying in the future two days and getting their memories erased. (Same case with Marauders traveling to Harry's time). I outlined a different take where Harry/Ginny/Hermione/Ron at the start of fourth year travel like 25 years into the future... and they didn't know how to return them... and were stuck there for a year or so. I had like 5 chaps but put it down to rework on it, hopefully will get some time to finish it.
