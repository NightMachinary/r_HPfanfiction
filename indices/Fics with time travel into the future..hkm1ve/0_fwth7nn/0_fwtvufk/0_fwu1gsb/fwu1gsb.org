Read a couple of them, obviously plus Lily. Will give a look to see if I find them , don't usually save links. They were also about erasing their memories and returning them. Bittersweet, because they knew they were going to die but happy the future was better blah blah... I also made an attempt at this, Marauders + Lily to start of third year, I have 3 chaps and like it a lot, though I also brought it down to rework.
