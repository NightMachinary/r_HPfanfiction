That's an interesting idea.

At the end of Deathly Hallows, Harry gives Voldemort a desperate last chance for remorse, but of course it doesn't work because that's not in the Dark Lord's character as we've seen built up through the series.

It would be incredibly difficult to redeem the Tom Riddle as written by Rowling; Voldemort's character is psychopathic and essentially irredeemable. After making so many horcuxes, he's an inhuman terror.

The only fic I've ever seen that does Light!Tom realistically, in-character, is linkffn(Rectifier by Niger Aquila). The divergence starts all the way back when young Tom opens the Chamber of Secrets; the change takes a large amount of work on the behalf of Dumbledore. The fic is abandoned, but it's worth a read.

Edit: Conciseness.
