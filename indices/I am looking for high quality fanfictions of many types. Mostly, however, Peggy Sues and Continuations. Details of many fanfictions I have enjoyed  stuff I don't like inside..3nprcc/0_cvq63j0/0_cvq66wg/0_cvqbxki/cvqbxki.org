Very big on FF: Harry crow. It has some good elements in it with the goblin world they built but honestly? It's such a major crap fest. It's more than sappy and cheesy. I feel dumber for having read as far as I have ( much farther than I should've) The harmony stuff was just so ugh. There was no real conflict. Good things happened to good people and bad things constantly happened to the bad ones.
