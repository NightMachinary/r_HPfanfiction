Linkffn(Ron El Greco). Linkffn(Biting the Hand That Feeds You) - yeah it's hinted Harmony but the comedy aspect will outweigh it. Linkffn(Finding Himself). Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Psychic Serpent). Linkffn(TMBlue) - not the best writing but a very imitating plot and premise. Linkffn(Champion by OctaviusOwl). Linkffn(Renegade by 1991Kira). Linkffn(Second Chances by Zaxarus)
