The /Alexandra Quick/ series is one of the best works of fanfiction ever conceived and written, if not /the/ best. It starts off with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle]], which itself is very well-written, and then it steps it up several notches with books 2, 3, and 4. Book 5 is currently in the works, though experiencing some delays. You may recognise the author as the same one who did Hogwarts Houses Divided (Inverarity).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8175132/1/Jamie-Evans-and-Fate-s-Fool][Jamie Evans and Fate's Bitch]] is a rockin' good read - enormously fun, hilarious and clever and erudite and thought-provoking at turns. Highly recommended.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7410369/1/Time-Heals-All-Wounds][Time Heals All Wounds]] is one that DLP doesn't like, but when have they /ever/ liked angsty stuff? This fic is a gorgeously intense and evocative piece of Bellamione - give it a go!!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11118152/1/The-Scientist][The Scientist]] is ongoing, and while it is a bit clunky at times, it's great if you like some good femslash. It's a slow-burning Hermione/Narcissa.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5906518/1/Ron-El-Greco][Ron El Greco]] explores the "mature" side of Ron/Hermione, and involves Ron being a diplomatic Auror in a rogue Middle Eastern city-state. It was recced below by another lovely personage.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4916690/1/Holly-Evans-and-the-Spiral-Path][Holly Evans and the Spiral Path]] is written by our very own [[/u/wordhammer]], and it's one I'm currently reading, but so far, it's been an interesting read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/The-Changeling][The Changeling]] is the last one I'll rec. It's basically "What if Ginny were sorted into Slytherin?" and continues from there. It's *good* - nearly professional-grade.
