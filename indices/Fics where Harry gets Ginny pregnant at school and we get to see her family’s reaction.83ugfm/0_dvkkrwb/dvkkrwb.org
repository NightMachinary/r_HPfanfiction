Unfortunately, i can't recall ever reading a fic like this. The closest thing that comes to mind is linkffn(Backwards with a Purpose by Deadwoodpecker) where the Weasleys (except Ron) oppose Harry hand Ginny's seemingly precocious relationship because they don't know that Ron, Harry and Ginny are time travelers.
