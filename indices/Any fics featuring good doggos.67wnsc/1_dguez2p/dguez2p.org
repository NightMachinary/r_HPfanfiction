I'm so sorry to hear about your pupper <3

I don't have any fics, but what about reading about the tiniest ever hero war dog? Smokey the Yorkshire Terrier: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoky_(dog)]] (She does not live for ever, even though all good dogs should, but she did survive the war and became a therapy dog and did all sorts of cool things. All while being impossibly adorable)
