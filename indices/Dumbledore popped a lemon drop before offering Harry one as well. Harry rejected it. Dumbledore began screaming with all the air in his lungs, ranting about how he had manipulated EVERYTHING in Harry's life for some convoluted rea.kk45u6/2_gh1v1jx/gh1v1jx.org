This brought to mind the idea of, rather than Dumbledore saying he manipulated everything, instead saying that that he was to blame for the things that happened to Harry. The thing is though, is that Dumbledore doesn't state specifically "what" he is to blame for. So based on this miscommunication, Harry starts believing that Dumbledore was admitting to things in Harry's life, while Dumbledore was meaning something else. For example, Dumbledore recalls Hagrid saying that he didn't tell Harry how to get onto Platform 9 3/4's and Dumbledore recalls that he neglected to tell Hagrid to make sure Harry was aware, so Dumbledore says to Harry, "Remember that incident when you were trying to access platform 9 3/4's", which Harry in turn thinks about Molly Weasley yelling out asking where the platform was, and thus helping Harry find it, and then Dumbledore continues to say, "that was my fault". So now Harry is thinking that his first meeting with the Weasley's was all a set up staged by Dumbledore.
