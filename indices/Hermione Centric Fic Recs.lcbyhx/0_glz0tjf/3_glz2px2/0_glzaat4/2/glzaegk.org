  Fourteen years after the war ended, Lord Voldemort rules Britain with a fist of iron, killing anyone who stands in his way. The remnants of The Army of Light are scattered and in hiding, and no one has seen Harry Potter since he vanished at the start of his fifth year. But when Voldemort's Prime Minister is assassinated in broad daylight, the resistance gains a renewed sense of hope, and start to believe that the war is not yet over.

  Hermione learns the hard way that there's a lot of truth that shouldn't be passed around. It's a story of multiple crises starting from identity, trust in one's loved ones, the trust which one's friend put in one. It's a story of doubts which people voice about other people. It's a story of friendships that are forged in crisis. It's also a love story as much as a story about love.A pre-PoA AU. Part 3 of Secrets & Keepers series. Can be read as a stand-alone.

  When Remus came back to himself, he was in the middle of the Forbidden Forest, naked, shivering with pain and with cold, and he could taste blood.“I don't have the full story,” said Madam Pomfrey. “You'll have to speak to Minerva or Albus for that. But Black has escaped, and - Remus, I am so sorry. You bit Hermione Granger.”or: a story of innocence, experience, and prejudice, spanning the summer holidays after Prisoner of Azkaban.

  When Hermione Jean Granger was one year old her parents died in a car crash. She knew all about it because she asked a lot of questions and her aunt and uncle believed in answering them.Why is the sky blue, auntie? Why are b's and d's like in the mirror? Where do songs come from? Why did Jenny Hopkins call me a--?Her father had accelerated into a green light, like you were supposed to. (By the time she was eight, Hermione had the driver's rulebook memorized). A truck driver, going the opposite way, hadn't stopped at a red.Hermione had been strapped in a car seat in the back, her aunt and uncle told her. She hadn't been hurt at all except for the scar that stood out, jagged, on her forehead.As Hermione grew up into a gangly, bushy-haired, buck-toothed wonder, she thought she could remember it-- a glaring green light, a rush of cold air.
