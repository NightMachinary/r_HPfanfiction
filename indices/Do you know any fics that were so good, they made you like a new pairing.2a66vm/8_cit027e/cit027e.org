Credit to [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4040192/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Girl-Who-Lived][HP and the Girl Who Lived]] by Agnostics Puppet for piquing my interest in Girl!Harry, whether she was paired with crosstime Harry or not.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5537755/1/Amends-or-Truth-and-Reconciliation][Amends...]] by Vera Rozalsky opened my eyes to Hermione/Neville, Hermione/Draco/Neville, and other funky fun.

There's a lost story (the author took her stuff down) called Sanitarium that portrayed the first gay or bi Harry that I could find believable. It also sparked my interest in writing train wrecks and I will never think of Theodore Nott as a background character ever again.

Spoiler: (for a story you can't read?) - in the story he corners Hermione into pulling out most of her memories of her magical education to put in his pensieve, later consuming the whole batch like soup. For months afterward, Hermione was unfocused and useless, like Luna without the whimsy, and she could never quite tell the others why her brain was missing.

Much later the trio finds Theo and makes him draw out the memories to give back to Hermione. Unfortunately, his own personality had adjusted to having all Hermione's extra knowledge, so taking it out again didn't leave him too much brain power. Talk about 'dazed and interested'...
