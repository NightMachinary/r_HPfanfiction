[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6435092/1/Turn][Turn]] is a story I clicked on because I liked other stories by the same author. A side pairing is Ginny/Blaise, which I'd never read before but liked.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6029161/1/White-Lies][White Lies]] is the story that made Snape/Lupin and Blaise/Neville quite appealing. I'm not sure how I came across it - I think it was in someone else's favorites list. Normally I'm not really into Snape paired with - well, anyone - but I found this to be written rather well.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2708248/1/Background-Secrets][Background Secrets]] made Fred/George/Lee a guilty pleasure, and opened me to the idea of Harry/Cedric.

And finally, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3973687/1/Crazy-Little-Things][Crazy Little Things]] is the fic that hooked me into Hermione/Luna.
