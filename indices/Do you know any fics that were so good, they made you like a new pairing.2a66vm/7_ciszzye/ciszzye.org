I just finished [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8186071/1/Harry-Crow][Harry Crow]], and it's an incredibly good story. The premise is that the Dursleys gave Harry back to the wizarding world after Dumbledore left him on their doorstep. Vernon took Harry to Gringotts and was raised a Goblin, trained to fight Voldylocks from an early age. This was the first time a pairing between Harry and Hermione was executed to the point where I actually fully supported it.
