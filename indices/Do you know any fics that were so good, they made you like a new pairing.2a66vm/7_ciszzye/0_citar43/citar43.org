Dont bother with any of robst's other stuff. Harry Crow works because he didnt grow up like canon, his others all follow the format of, something happens that makes harry fall in love with hermione in seconds and her love him back. And he becomes a sweet talker and a major gentlemen and will kill people to defend his friends, all with his canon upbringing. So basically it turns Harry Potter into Harry crow with no backstory
