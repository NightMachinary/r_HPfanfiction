The Shoebox Project is a decent Remus/Sirius, has some really funny scenes, but it's a little overhyped.

Reason for Life is my current favorite Sirius/Hermione I think (though I waver). Time travel, Hermione feels she has to go back in time to give Sirius something to live for.

One hundred sixty nine is another really good Sirius/Hermione time travel fic, but it takes place after Hogwarts. Interesting use of magic, interesting characterization...

The last Marauder is my current remus/Hermione recommendation. It's definitely sad in some parts, but I think it redeems itself. I reread this one every few months when I'm on a fanfic binge.

I think I liked 26x brighter than the sun (wolfstar). The Stealing Harry series is often recommended for WolfStar shippers, though I didn't like some of the characterizations, and I don't think the series was actually finished. Worth a read though, even if just for a different take on the universe.

That's it for what I'm currently seeing in my kindle, but in about 18 hours I can go through my bookmarks and edit this :) I don't generally recommend stories shorter than a novel, sorry!
