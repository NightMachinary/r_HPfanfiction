I don't remember the title, but I read a fic a long, long time ago that was LMHG. Someone else here has probably read it as well. Lucius kidnapped Hermione and while she stays in his dungeon cell place they slowly fall in love and it has a bittersweet ending that I won't give away.

And I wish I could remember what particular fic got me into HPTR, because I can kind of sort of remember a time in which I would not have thought it a good pairing. :3
