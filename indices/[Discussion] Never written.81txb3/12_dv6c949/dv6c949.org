A collection of short stories detailing the development of magic.

Ancient magic. A tribe shaman discovers their control over arcane forces. Or a benevolent precursor race gifts them their /Magicka/. Short stories about the powerful /magus/ that would eventually become recognized as gods. The rise and fall of Atlantis. The unforgivables. Were there more? Who created them?

Forgotten magics of the proto-human. Ancient cities of black gold that fell before /Homo erectus/ gave its first steps.

Will edit if I get more ideas.
