The Sorcerous Seven: a retelling of the Seven Samurai in the Potterverse.

Summary: 19 years later, Goblins are arming for war. The one man who Minister Draco Malfoy believes could possibly stop them is the same wizard they've been trying to kill for the last twenty years- Harry Potter. Story based on/dedicated to Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai.

Starring: Harry Potter; Luna Lovegood; Cormac MacLaggan; Dean Thomas; Seamus Finnegan; Dennis Creevey; and introducing Harriet Orla Quirke.

With Appearances by: Draco Malfoy, Blaise Zabini, Percy Weasley, Daphne Greengrass, Asteria Greengrass Malfoy

Special Appearances by: Kingsley Shacklebolt, Neville Longbottom and Ginny Weasley

Act 1 - Draco realizes his huge mistake in trying to bluff the goblin clan. Blaise points out that everyone else who knew how to magically fight- not duel, but engage in lethal mass battle- had left Britain when Potter did. Draco sends Asteria and Daphne to lure Potter back to Britain in order to help.

Act 2 - The Greengrass girls find Harry solving a tricky situation by giving up his wand and taking down a possessed/dark wizard using a magic blade. Also witnessing the fight are Dean and Orla. Everyone meets. Harry agrees, despite protests. They find Dennis at the transit station and he shucks his uniform and says 'So, where are we going?' They bump into McLaggan while looking for Seamus in Ireland.

Act 3 - They meet with Draco and a few advisors. Draco insists that they operate anonymously, so that his Ministry can take credit if they win and blame poor hiring choices if they lose but survive. Harry accedes. He leads them to Luna, seeking guidance on how to win this fight. She tells them it is unwinnable. So, she'll come along and see if she's right. Retraining the Aurors, LEDs and militia to fight goblins takes time and stealth. When the first cadre gets rambunctious, they fight a sally force of goblins. While the cadre is decimated, the goblins weren't expecting any resistance at all. This will trigger the full invasion.

Act 4 - Luna sneaks into Gringott's to steal their plans. McLaggan tries something similar but gets his lieutenant killed. Orla falls in love with an amiable wizard who gets killed. The veterans console her by mentioning their own lost loves (Hermione; Ginny; the Patils; Susan Bones; Natalie McDonald)

Act 5 - using Luna's captured plans, they stage ambushes to handle each of the goblin armies that rise from the depths to invade. The battlegrounds include shopping malls, zoos, museums, low grade housing and King's Cross station; each commander handles their force as they will. In the end, they blunt the attack well enough that goblins sue for peace.

If you've seen the original, you should know who survives.
