So Harry died in the chamber of secrets but divine intervention resurrected him and combined him with the Basilisk and Fawkes (dead to Dark Ice curse). He basically has them as his animagus forms but also as metamorphmagus material? so he can look like a redhead because fawkes' plumage but he can't freestyle like Tonks. He takes the Diary (with Ginny Weasley in it) and eventually takes the Sword of Gryffindor and stabs Riddle back into the diary while destroying it, shunting Ginny back into existence moments before stabbing the diary. She becomes his devoted servant.

Oh, and he gets bit by Remus and throws werewolf powers in there. 50/50 on him making out with a Dementor and eating it too?

Since he has more dark creatures than light creatures, he is technically a Dark asset, and as such the Divine Entity that intervened with his death turns its back on him. Identity crisis ensues, oh look also a murder tournament.

Harry is pretty good at concealing his creatureselves, right up until the First Task.

  Moony (his werewolf-self): BIG LIZARD ROARED. ESTABLISH DOMINANCE.

  Fawkes: Oh yea, show everyone how majestic we are.

  Sal (the Basilisk): haha yes we are the King of Serpents let us show this silly little winged thing its mistake.

  Harry: THIS IS NOT A DEMOCRACY, PEOPLE. WE HAVE AN ACTUAL PLAN FOR THIS-

  Fawkes: Too late.

  Harry roars and becomes a basilisk sized, phoenix-winged, werewolf-shaped pile of danger and throws himself at the dragon, beating the crap out of it. The audience is entirely silent.

Harry wins the tournament by sheer intimidation, has another Voldemort showdown, and comes back really really angry.

Fifth year, he gets kicked out of Hogwarts (Ginny follows him), and seeks a way of reassuring himself he's not evil. He hears legends of the Visalis, Sword of Light and Darkness, a blade that reflects the truth of the wielder. He eventually locates it. When he wields it, it is covered in oddly comforting black flames. Harry has a revelation that Dark does not mean Evil, and goes back to Hogwarts to defend the school from Umbridge.

He basically forms a vigilante group with a bunch of chill Slytherins, and sneaks into dormitories to heal people's Blood Quill wounds. Hermione started a group of people who would wear headbands with notice-me-not charms on them and draw Harry's scar with the blood quill. Never really thought about how they'd get rid of Umbridge, but Sirius doesn't die.

Harry makes a gang of Dark But Not Evil and makes a third side, since the Order are a bunch of wussies and don't like him anymore even though he is literally the phoenix they named their group after. Sirius, Remus, Hermione, the Weasleys, and the P.A. (Potter's Army) are kind of in limbo between the DBNE and the Order until the Order actually tries attacking Harry's faction.

Harry, Dumbledore, and Voldemort have this massive three-way battle, ending with Harry grabbing Voldemort, asking Dumbledore not to punish the D.B.N.E, and phoenix-flashing the Dark Lord into the sun. Last words: "Hot enough for ya?"

Plot twist Harry is a phoenix and doesn't die permanently, Earth is hit with a flaming, winged, baby-on-a-meteor about a year later.
