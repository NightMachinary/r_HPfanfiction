With all the time-travel fics out there, I wanted to take it to the extreme. Basically have everyone and their mother go back in time to try and change the future.

Harry is the first who does, coming back from two decades of war from a world ruined by world war 3, started by Voldie etc. etc.

And then when he first enters the Hogwarts Exress he finds that Hermione did it as well, except she was smarter about it, going back as far as possible. (The day of her birth). She is also now a highly logical semi-dark techno-mage intent on bringing humanity to the stars.

And on and on it goes until practically no one of importance haven't gone back in time (by various methods and utility), and they all realize they will probably be trapped forever in this endless timeloop because whenever one side wins, the other just goes back in time and tries again.
