Oooh pick me pick me!

I've been trying to write this for the past few months but realized I am not good enough to do the idea justice so its on hold, while I write other things. (HP/IC crossover at the moment)

I tried to make this a one shot but it just kept getting fleshed out so I sort of ran with it.

/Second Choice/

Brief Summary:

AU: Voldemort wins, Harry is not the child of prophecy and his parents are killed in the war. He is raised by Regulus as his brother's dying wish. Hogwarts only takes those of pureblood from good families, the rest are sent to trade schools. Ginny Weasley manages to get into Hogwarts due to something something power level something haven't figured out. While at Hogwarts Harry/Ginny become close, even though Harry knows she is below his station. Lots of stuff happens and bam its 4th year. Harry takes Daphne to the ball as the Greengrasses have been courting him, as the Potter name is old, even if disgraced slightly by James's treason. Daphne and Harry don't really like each other, but Daphne goes along with it as it is her family's wishes and Harry does as he is already in a precarious position (Voldemort won't forget the son of one of his enemies); this marriage would be a chance to cement his good standing.

So basically what I want to happen is Harry has to choose between Ginny who he loves, or Daphne who would grant him political immunity, wealth, and status. I plan on having three endings.

One with Ginny: In short they have a loving relationship until Voldemort kills him.

One with Daphne: He is miserable and lonely trapped in a loveless relationship.

The last where Harry unleashes Fiendfyre in the Wizengamot killing himself but taking the government with him.

My goal is to not only write a decent romance, but have the reader really think about the choices that are presented to them. Which ending would you choose would be what I want them to walk away from the story asking themselves.
