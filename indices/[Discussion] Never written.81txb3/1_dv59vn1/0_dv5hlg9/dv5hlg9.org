I agree very much with this sentiment. I can't see Hermione hiding it if she had lycantropy, she's too much of an activist. I feel like Hermione would stop being a kick ass woman who happens to have an unfortunate disease to become The Werewolf who also happens to be Hermione. However I also don't see her going along with all of the bad muggle romance novel tropes either.

I can see Ginny playing off her lycantropy as a bad period and being very in your face with anyone who wants to challenge her on it. She would continue to be a famous Harpy and a mother and wife, and only much later when she decides to write her autobiography she slips in the details of being a kick ass sports star, prolific journalist, and mother while also turning into a werewolf once a month on the sly.
