A story that shits on "werewolf culture". I remember reading a story where Hermione was bitten by Lupin in PoA, then some ministry dude showed up and started rambling about getting Hermione a pack, an alpha and all that stuff. Hermione, for some reason seemed quite happy with this.

That got me wondering why there are no fics where someone gets bitten but simply shrugs it off. They are different for 12 hours once a month. There's no reason to change your entire life due to that. Yes, there's a social stigma, but If you are trying to prove that you are still a functional member of society, perhaps living in a "pack" is not the best way to go.

Instead of romantising the whole werewolf thing, I want to read about a character who tries not to care about the whole thing. A character who rejects the idea of letting an illness define him/her but fight against both, the stigma and the victim mentality.

And preferably without turning Lupin into a good guy. The man did absolutely nothing for Harry but had to take marriage advice from a virgin too young to buy a pint of beer. He let the illness define him. He is the exact opposite of what I'm looking for.
