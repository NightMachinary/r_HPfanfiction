I've wanted to write a Marauders-era triwizard tournament for aaages now. It would be cool to explore Durmstrang or Beauxbatons and the logistics behind taking an entire year of students to a different country for like 9+ months. And any excuse for slow-burn Sirius/Remus and Lily-as-part-of-the-gang lol.

I think my plans are a little ambitious, though xP Coming up with interesting puzzles and challenges is a lot harder than writing the bits in between. I know it's not exactly a unique problem in this fandom, but I'm also not really sure how far to go in terms of filling in the gaps. If the Tournament had never been cancelled it's easy to assume that certain things would have changed a bit over 200 years. Like maybe they wouldn't have challenges where the audience literally sat and stared at a lake for an hour until something happened. My imagination tends to run wild in this fandom, and I don't really know how far to deviate from canon for the sake of world building and plot.

It would be fun to write though, lol.
