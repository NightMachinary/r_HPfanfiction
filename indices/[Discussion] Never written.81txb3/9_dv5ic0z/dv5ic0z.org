I been desperately trying to figure out a way to write a "cool" Snape fic. My idea is that Snape has been actively playing both Dumbledore and Voldemort, and is pretty much just trying to get outta this thing alive, with no hard loyalties to either party. Throw in a little Mentor! in there, and playing around with the muggle world.

But that's been beat to death, and the fresh way that I'm thinking in my head he comes off douchey and Mary-Sue ish.

So it's probably never gonna happen, but I can dream.
