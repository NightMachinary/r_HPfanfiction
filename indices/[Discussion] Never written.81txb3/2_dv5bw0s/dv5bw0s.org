Let me describe to you what would be my perfect fic.

1. Kidnap [[/u/Ihateseatbelts]].

2. Read to him every single Conan the Barbarian, Solomon Kane, Kull of Atlantis story Robert E. Howard wrote while doing the revolving lamp thing from the Lake Laogi episode from Avatar: The Last Airbender.

3. Have him then write the adventures of Bill Weasley, Cursebreaker.
