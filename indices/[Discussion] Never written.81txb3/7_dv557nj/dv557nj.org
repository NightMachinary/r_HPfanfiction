There's no rule about posting more than one idea so back off I'm coming in with Plot Bunny number 2!

/Neutrality Above All./

Eventual Harry/Ginny. The story starts in the Chamber where Lord Voldemort gives Harry an ultimatum. Either get me a new body or the girl dies. Harry makes an unbreakable vow in return for an unbreakable vow not to hurt Ginny or Himself. His part of the vow is that he must take the diary and obtain Voldemort a new body which he does.

Over the summer Harry manages to resurrect LV with the diary's help. LV acknowledges his help and reminds him that his promise of not hurting Harry is only valid if he stays out of the way.

Harry says he understands, but while at Hogwarts he begins to feel guilt. He goes to Dumbledore hinting at what has occurred. (cannot say exactly, vow binds him somewhat)

Draco approaches him, (rumours of chamber) and asks him what happened. Harry hints at LV being back sublty, which Draco promptly demands to be taken to him. Harry sets up the meeting and Draco thanks him.

War progresses. Haven't fleshed the rest out yet.

TLDR: The premise is that Harry was trapped into helping LV and tries to toe the line between neutrality and helping each side occasionally. Eventually something happens that causes him to pick a side for good.

*I've never read a story where Harry truly tries to play both sides, both giving Voldemort just enough help to keep him placated, while helping Dumbledore enough to assuage his conscience while staying under the radar from LV.*
