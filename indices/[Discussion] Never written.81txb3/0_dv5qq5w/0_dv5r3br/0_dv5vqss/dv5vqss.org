The Room of Requirement was able to contain the Fiendfyre, but not stop it. For 19 years it has burned, the spell sustained by the nature of the room. For the Room of Requirement gives its occupant whatever it wants...

Next gen fic with a new villain: a sentient magical entity made of fiendfyre, born in the Room of Requirement.

AU where Harry was left a squib by Voldemort's attack in 1981... except he is a metamorphmagus. That power survived the attack. The fic would have Harry going to Muggle high school and would model itself roughly around the story structure shown in Buffy. Remus Lupin would become Harry's mentor, taking a role at the school, and he would have a few Muggle friends too. Together they interact with the fringes of the magical world, the bits that the wizards in their arrogance ignore as inferior and not their concern: werewolves, vampires, hags, etc. Wizards are a distant presence in the fic, like the Watcher's Council in Buffy.

Post-DH epilogue compliant time travel story where it's a Voldemort sympathiser who goes back in time, not Harry. There's a break-in at the Department of Mysteries and Auror Harry goes it investigate under his invisibility cloak. He arrives just in time to see a mysterious wizard in the time room fiddling with an artefact. A magical backlash knocks Harry out.

When he wakes the world has changed. His scar tingles: Voldemort is alive. He quickly realises that he is living in a dystopian world where Voldemort was never defeated.

After some near-misses with the authorities, Harry finds the remnant Order, who are very suspicious of him. Harry learns that he was killed in his summer before sixth year, assassinated by a mysterious assailant. It becomes clear: the wizard in the Department of Mysteries went back in time and killed Harry.

Harry tries to persuade the Order to make one last effort: they have to get Harry into Voldemort's Ministry so he can break into the Department of Mysteries, go back in time and prevent his own assassination.

The Order is sceptical, as their spirit is broken. Everyone is different to how Harry remembers. Remus and Tonks, for example, cannot bear to look at each other: Tonks is their mole within Voldemort's ranks, impersonating Narcissa Malfoy, whom the Order assassinated years ago. Remus can't stand that she is sleeping with Lucius Malfoy as part of her cover.

But eventually the Order relents. They assault the Ministry and make it to the DoM at the cost of many lives. Harry uses the time machine, goes back in time and prevents his own assassination.

And is stuck in the past. The alternate dystopian timeline is now but a figment of Harry's memories. It has corrected itself out of existence.

Epilogue: Harry, still in the past, goes to meet Albus Dumbledore. He confesses everything. Dumbledore explains how it is that Harry survived the change in the timeline: Harry's blood in Voldemort's veins. Voldemort being alive once more meant Harry could not die. This combined with Harry being under his invisibility cloak at the time of the change resulted in Harry both surviving the change but also not being displaced by it.

Harry confesses he has no idea what to do now. He misses his kids.

Dumbledore asks him some probing questions. He was able to walk into an Acromantula nest at the age of 12 and survive? He was able to take a portkey out of the graveyard, though Voldemort would not have planned for the portkey to be two-way? He broke into the Department of Mysteries aged 15 without any trouble? He was able to evade Voldemort's Ministry for months at the age of 17?

Harry understands. Like his experience with time turners, this was always meant to be. His presence in the past was already factored into the future. Harry would protect his younger self, guiding him from the shadows, unaware that he ever existed. He would return to the future the long way around. He will see his children again, on the day that his younger self disappears into the past.

For a while now I've wanted to see a HP story that deals with Harry and co. fighting against a curse. Not a "point and shoot" curse but one of the more arcane, mystical types of curses, like the DADA curse, or the curses on some of the books in the restricted section.

I see it as an in-canon mini-adventure that takes place within one of the books, between canon events. A long one shot or novella would work best. Like an episode of Buffy.

Not sure what the curse would be though.

Post-Deathly Hallows fic with a Harry/Fleur extramarital affair. A lot of plots going at once: Harry's relationship problems with Ginny, who is doing her last year at Hogwarts; his Auror work: part time training, but also working to capture the last Death Eaters; his developing magical ability, which has four causes - the removal of the horcrux piece, which he'd been unconsciously fighting for years, the mere fact that he can focus on magic for the first time in his life, his mastery of occlumency at the end of DH, and his Holly wand teaching him things it absorbed from Voldemort; Kingsley increasingly leaning on Harry politically, dragging Harry into the post-war political arena; and Harry's desire to be a part of Teddy Lupin's life, which is his point of regular contact with Fleur, who is helping Andromeda look after him. Also features a new form of full contact Quidditch which is quickly replacing the old in terms of popularity, which uses Voldemort's flight charm, reverse engineered by Flitwick. Episodic in format, each chapter being like the episode of a TV series - telling a contained story but also contributing to the greater arcs.

Envisaged as the backstory to the HP/Stargate fusion above, where the drama caused by the Harry/Fleur affair is what results Harry in leaving England and going travelling.

Teen comedy. Post-OotP, summer fic. Don't tell the Muggles, they said. Don't let them see. But Dudley's friend Mandy has amazing tits, and impressing her suddenly feels very important to Harry. International Statute of What?

Tl,DR more things should be like Buffy.
