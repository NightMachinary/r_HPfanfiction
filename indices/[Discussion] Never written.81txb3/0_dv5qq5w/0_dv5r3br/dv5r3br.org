Combination of a number of different plot bunnies into a single AU world:

We start off with elements from Lords of Magic, with alterations:

- Certain very rare wizards are born with magic which is qualitatively different from other wizards, making them significantly more magical beings. This does not just mean that their spells are stronger, it means that they have a greater connection to magic more generally e.g. superior magical instincts and senses. These wizards are known as the Alchemists.

- Alchemists have the power to perform true human transfiguration, not just of the body but also of the soul. This means they can use transfiguration to de-age your body and your soul won't remember your true age. By this means, alchemists are able to give themselves and anyone they choose immortal life (or at least, eternal youth).

- The wizarding population is significantly larger than in canon due to many wizards never dying (due to being deaged by the Alchemists).

- Due to the combination of the above factors, the politics of wizarding society is dominated by the rare Alchemists who are the source of immortality. Many of them are famous historical wizards from canon. Each alchemist has their own court - the set of families loyal to them, for whom they provide immortality in return for service in a feudal type relationship.

Now we veer off into new territory:

- The International Statute of Secrecy was never passed.

- All over the world, wizards actively and openly interfere in Muggle government (or rather, since there is no separation, simply THE government). In Britain this occurs to the extent that the political class is almost entirely the same as the magical elite. There are very few Muggles who occupy the top level of society. The wizarding elite rule the Muggle world directly, both politically and financially.

- Despite this, wizarding inequality remains - there are still poor wizards, though they're doing better than poor Muggles.

- The British Empire remains in full swing.

- Honour duels are still permitted.

- Technology has taken a different direction to the real world. The most notable absences are the lack of widespread electrification and the lack of development of rocketry (also no nuclear weapons). The industrial revolution still took place (with a magical twist) and there is a generally steampunky feel to technology. But it's not all bad news for Muggles: the proliferation of magical items for Muggle use has resulted in some novel technologies the modern Muggle world lacks, especially in the areas of medicine, transportation, and "magical AI".

- AIR SHIPS.

- As the wizarding elite became more and more embedded in the rule of the Muggle world, so too did they become more and more wedded to physical locations, and in particular London. As such, wizarding power and wealth have concentrated in London, and along with it so too has demand for local magical services.

- Over the years, magical theory becomes ever more complex as further advances are made. On top of this, new areas of magical study are developing relating to the use of magic in ways that did not occur in canon e.g. magical engineering, magic on the mass scale. These factors have resulted in a growing demand for magical tertiary education.

- The combination of the above two factors resulted, in the mid 1800s, in the founding of the Westminster College of the Magical Arts. It serves largely the children of the magical elite i.e. Hogwarts students.

- The Potter family are not part of the magical elite, but are rather solidly magical middle class (which still corresponds to a pretty high level of privilege, but which still means a large gulf separates them from the empire-spanning titans of commerce who occupy the top levels of society).

- Tom Riddle is a young Alchemist who promotes that wizards return to the "old ways" where they are less focused on industry and material wealth and more focused on individual magical achievement. He bemoans the impact the Muggle world has had on wizarding life and feels like wizards have lost their way, steadily making themselves more and more like Muggles and losing touch with their magic. He wishes to enact a separation between wizards and Muggles where wizards create their own society based entirely around magic and they leave the Muggles to their squalor and dirt. He promotes this cause through political means but of course uses plenty of underhand, illegal and immoral tactics. Many of the wizarding young and poor - those who are disadvantaged by the structure of wizarding society - flock to his cause. No "Voldemort", no civil war (except in the form of murders and disappearances).

- James Potter foolishly challenged Tom Riddle to an honour duel and was killed in that duel. Harry and his younger sister are raised by Lily.

- Harry does not attend Hogwarts, which is beyond his family's means, but he attends a decent school and achieves excellent grades, considered by all his teachers to be a magical talent. He is therefore able to secure a place at Westminster College, where he will rub shoulders with the magical elite.

- The story opens as Harry, age 18 and already accomplished in the magical arts, starts at Westminster College.

The focus of the story is largely political/social/relationship based, tracking:

- Harry's friendships and relationships at college, including a romance with Daphne Greengrass, someone who is socially completely out of his league.

- How he goes from being an outsider to beginning to break into the social circles of the magical elite.

- How he begins to attract the attention of both Tom Riddle and Albus Dumbledore due to his rapidly growing magical talents.

- The mystery of what led James Potter to challenge Tom Riddle to a duel, and Harry's potentially misguided desire for revenge.

--------------

Interdimensional HP Hunger Games. Head Auror Harry Potter is pulled through dimensions by a group of mysterious beings. It quickly emerges that he, along with a number of other people from other HP alternate universes, have been kidnapped in order to take part in a Hunger Games style tournament.

Whoever wins the Games gets to join the group of mysterious beings.

The competitors:

- Canon Harry, age 54, Head Auror.

- A Dumbledore from a universe where he sided with Grindelwald (before stabbing him in the back).

- A sane, coolly rational and deadly Lord Voldemort who won the war.

- A Lily Evans who led a bloody anti-Pureblood revolution.

- Helen of Troy, the Veela who launched a thousand ships.

- A Goblin banker, Head of Gringotts Mergers and Acquisitions.

- A Neville Longbottom in his 30s with a lightning bolt scar on his forehead. (It will turn out at the end, after he tricks Harry into an alliance, that he's from a universe where the BWL was kidnapped and raised by Voldemort)

- A wand-wielding House Elf from a universe where he Elves overthrew wizard rule.

- An Incan wizard-king who harnessed mass human sacrifice to gain immortality.

- Gilderoy Lockhart who actually did what he says he did.

- Hagrid, from a world where Tom Riddle took him under his wing.

- Mia, an apparently average Hogwarts schoolgirl who seems to have been dragged in by mistake.

Each competitor is provided with a mentor. Harry is provided with the ghost of Severus Snape.

Fic is to focus not just on winning the games, but also on ultimately overthrowing the group who organised them.

Wildcard element, out of the control of the organisers: Sirius Black from Harry's universe, who ended up in the arena when he fell through the veil and has been living there for years.
