HP/LotR. Balrog wakes up beneath Gringotts. Its presence transforms goblins back into their true nature, once again in the presence of a guiding mind of power. To feature Head Auror Harry Potter chasing a rampaging Balrog through Muggle London.

--------------

Christmas fic #1. Pre-Hogwarts, Dresden Files crossover. Nine-year-old Harry Potter never gets any Christmas presents and he wants to know why. He decides to take matters into his own hands and crawls up the Dursleys' chimney to find himself in a winter wonderland. Kid!Harry and kid!Maeve going on an adventure together to find Santa Claus.

--------------

Christmas fic #2. Dobby recruits Harry into a trip to the North Pole to help liberate the House Elves from their cruel master, the dark wizard Santa Claus.

--------------

Subversive Harry/Pansy romance that pokes fun at the misunderstood Slytherin girl and marriage contract tropes.

Essentially, back in sixth year, Pansy tricked Harry into signing a marriage contract by playing the "I'm just a poor, abused Slytherin girl who just wants to escape my Death Eater family and join your side" card, leading to a whirlwind romance where Harry, thinking with his dick, signs a marriage contract so that he can have sex with her. The moment the ink was on the page she reveals the ruse: she never cared for him, she just wants to inherit his money when Voldemort inevitably kills him.

Unfortunately for Pansy, Harry beat Voldemort and now the two of them are stuck together. The fic opens post-Hogwarts and follows Harry and Pansy as they each try to make each other's life so miserable that they ask for a divorce (the party requesting the divorce loses the cash). To feature both of them sleeping around and attempting to cock block the other.

I wouldn't want to play the fic as a straight-up romance because that's not the point, but the idea is for the two of them to develop a kind of camaraderie based on this competition they have going between them, and ultimately end up quite comfortable/quasi-affectionate with each other.

Poking fun at the "Ice Queen" thing by taking it entirely literally.

HBP divergence. When Scrimgeour comes to the Burrow at Christmas, he has a task for Harry: he must help the Ministry secure an alliance with the kingdom of Svalbard, one of the most powerful magical nations in the world. How? Rufus recommends starting with the King's daughter, the Ice Princess: Daphne Greengrass.

--------------

Speaking of ice...

When Elsa's powers leave Anna injured in the prologue to Frozen, her parents decide there's only one thing for it: she has to go to Hogwarts.

An Elsa-centric exploration of Hogwarts in the 1780s. Focus on drama and politics (Elsa being a future queen, the first magical royal in centuries, albeit of a small kingdom).

--------------

GoF peggy sue (fic where Harry's consciousness goes back in time to his younger self). Unlike other peggy sue fics, this is one year only. Harry grabs the portkey to escape the graveyard at the end of GoF just as Voldemort's spell hits it. When he lands, he finds himself just after he's been selected as a Champion.

(Important plot point: remember that Harry doesn't know about Moody at this point, though he does know that Voldemort has a servant at Hogwarts. Harry will be prevented from Gary Stu victory by confiding in Moody mid way through the fic).

--------------

HP/Buffy fusion fic where HP characters are merged into the Buffy world. Hogwarts is the code name for the school where the children of Watchers are sent. Tom Riddle was a powerful warlock who tried to take over the Watcher's Council. Harry's parents were Watchers killed by him.

We join the fic in Harry's second year at Cambridge university, where he is studying Anglo-Saxon, Celtic and Norse, having been mentored under the magic expert Albus Dumbledore at school.

The plot is centred around an attempted resurrection of the necromancer Gellert Grindelwald, whose body was sent to Sunnydale to be protected by the Slayer. Unfortunately no one seems to have told her this... so Harry is sent by the Watcher's Council as part of a team under the Watcher Sirius Black to inform and assist Buffy.

--------------

HP/Stargate fusion. Post DH, no epilogue. Everything from Stargate has been "magicised": the Goa'uld are immortal non-corporeal magical beings which possess people magically, the Stargate is a magical portal between worlds, no space ships. When the Stargate is discovered in 1928 by a British expedition the Ministry of Magic appropriate it and it goes to the Department of Mysteries. They figure out how to activate it in 2008.

Meanwhile, Harry Potter has been gaining a name for himself as a globe trotting adventurer and has attracted the Ministry's attention thanks to a mysterious armband he found in Egypt. They bring him in, determined to take the arm band off him, and they reach a deal... Harry will let them borrow it, if they let him in on their secret project.

And so it is that Auror Ron Weasley, Unspeakable Hermione Weasley and adventurer Harry Potter go through the Stargate for the first time, accompanied by various other wizards.

As well as the obvious, the story would also uncover bit by bit the back story for how the various characters ended up in these situations.

CoS AU. Harry has never seen or even heard of house elves before, so he's dangerously naive. Dobby comes along, claims to be a house elf and claims Harry is in danger. All he needs to do is follow Dobby and Dobby will get him to safety...

... it turns out Dobby is not a house elf at all, but an erkling:

#+begin_quote
  Erklings are elfish creatures, three feet tall on average (making them larger than gnomes) with pointed faces, which have a particular affinity for the taste of children. Their high pitch cackles are particularly entrancing to children, and they use this to lure them away from their guardians to eat them. These creatures also enjoy shooting darts at unsuspecting victims.

Harry goes with Dobby and Dobby eats him.
