I have three very different Voldemort-centric stories. The first two I have begun to write but abandoned for now because I wasn't happy with the results. The third is an idea too epic for me to do it justice and I haven't even tried.

- An AU diverging at the end of the first book: his ten years of agony as a flayed-spirit-thing in Albania, instead of turning Voldemort crazier than before, have driven him to reform. He only wanted the Stone to go back to a body, but would just use it the one time and then returning. Only, he still distrusts Dumbledore and thinks the Headmaster would just kill him on sight rather than listen to his plight. Faced with these facts, what's Harry (a Harry who does not yet have /that/ much reason to idolize Dumbledore) to do?

- Voldemort in Neverland. Young-adult 1960's Voldemort's world tour includes a stop by the magical land of Neverland, where he hopes to get the secret of unsupported flight from Peter Pan.

- Title: /The Horcrux Lords/. The year is 2011. Twenty years ago, a bold plot by Death Eaters who didn't quite understand how these things work led to all the Horcruxes getting body of their own like the Diary, plus the original Voldemort getting a body back. Ever since, the different Voldemorts have been waging war against one another. The Statute has fallen and the world is riddled with expanding kingdoms each ruled by one of the Voldemorts.
