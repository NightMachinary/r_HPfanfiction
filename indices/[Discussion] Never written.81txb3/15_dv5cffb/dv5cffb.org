(Warning:long post)

/The Lion's Tale(s)/

/Massive/ 5 arc* thing (AU after the second arc). Lots of world building,loads of canon and non-canon stuff,even crosses over with LoTR and ASOIAF.

*1st arc:Marauders era. Notable in that it will feature Tessa Netting and Anna Brisbin,a pair of real-life Potterheads.

2nd arc:first war with Voldemort. Three points of divergence:

- Regulus lives

- Peter sacrifices himself so that all three Potters live

- At the same time,an assault happens on the Longbottoms,but Aurors arrive in time and they stay sane. Bellatrix and Barty Jr are still sent to Azkaban,Rabastan and Rodolphus are killed.

3rd arc:Harry's childhood. Obviously different for many reasons. Harry has his parents,Sirius,Regulus,Remus,and others to raise him and teach him about magic, and he has many childhood friends/future Hogwarts classmates. Oh,and Petunia marries somebody else.

4th arc:Harry's Hogwarts years. Lots of similar stuff to OTL,but also differences where possible. The following people get spared:

- Quirrell (his non-Voldemort half)

- Cedric (obviously)

- Sirius (obviously)

- Dumbledore (for a while)

- Remus and Tonks (obviously)

- Fred (ditto)

- Regulus (ditto)

- Lavender (who's in Middle Earth)

5th arc:the next generation. Haven't spent a whole lot of thought on this one yet.
