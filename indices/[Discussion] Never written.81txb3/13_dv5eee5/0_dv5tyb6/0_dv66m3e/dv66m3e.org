Not sure why that is a plot hole?

Snape isn't going to know the world history, only his slice of it. Thus a good part of the story is Hermione discovering it

This isn't a very visible thing: concept is that the world remains as JK described it but with this sinister workings in the background. The system is there to describe why muggleborns all keep to the SOS & never really gain power. This is about soft power, not hard power. (A muggleborn businessman might start out for himself but after meeting the first head of family that needed him, he would start shifting to taking favorable deals for that family and bad ones for their enemies.)

The 'leave the country' is intended to be a viable option, but not overly desirable. The other countries systems are similarly problematic

Maybe I can clarify the magic system more: At the start each magical family member was (passively) pooling a bit of magic to be used to shield the families children. The children's magic sought shelter in this shield, and in exchange the children's magic molds them into what it considers appropriate for their family (yes there are loopholes here)

Now the national system grew out of using apprenticeships to extend this shield to muggleborns. Over time this resulted in a 'national shield'. Each British witch puts a bit of magic into a national (basic, less than the family shield) shield can protect young magic users. When a young witch's magic seeks shelter from the chaos, it seeks out this shield. In exchange, their magic molds them in accordance with the national system.

Thus if the British system is Lords and Ladies, magic helps shift the muggleborn views into accepting that. Of course, if you could change your self image, your magic would seek a different shield. But they would also come with costs, based on the priority of that group. For example, America (and other newer counties) would likely not have the "Noble family" type system and instead have a more nationalistic system. That can easily be portrayed as just as bad yet different.

I intended 'running away' to be a viable option to be explored after they figure out how the system works, but to have enough problems to make it not practical
