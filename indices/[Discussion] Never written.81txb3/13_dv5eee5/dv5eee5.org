I do have one I have been chewing on

I wanted to do a 'grey vs grey' (Voldemorte wasn't so bad, Dumbles wasn't so pure), and I also wanted to play around with the 'family magic / lords and ladies' setting.

Basically, the story would be Hermione confronts Snape about how you could have such a string anti-muggleborn movement when there are so few / they do so little in the Wizarding world. Snape struggles because she reminds him of Lily but eventually decides she deserves to know, and starts her on a path to discover the world isn't quite what it seems.

The world history is as follows: Early on, new Witch's and Wizards would get assaulted by the chaotic magic of the world. Those who survived were the stereotypical 'witch in the forest' type. This is because raw magic is so chaotic and against the order of the human mind that it burns them. Those who survive wished to protect their children, so their magic created a sort of 'shield' for members of their family. This would be the origin of magical families. A Child's magic would instinctively shield itself in the magic of the family, becoming a sort of self-enforcing system. A child considering itself a member of a magical family will have his magic enforce the subservience to the family's magical head.

Muggleborn's don't have the protection of a head of family, so you eventually see the evolution of an 'Apprentice' system, where existing magical families would take on Apprentices, thus giving them the protection of the families magic and protecting them from the chaos. Of course, if a muggleborn stayed independent for a generations, they would start a new magical line, but eventually this becomes very had to do. This would evolve into a national magical system (So because the wizard/witch considered themselves a british wizard or witch, their magic sought shelter in the 'old families' magical system, thus subserving themselves to that system. The formal apprentice system melts away, with Muggleborn's magical loyalty going to whatever family ends up needing them first.

The Grindelwald war was about the future of the muggleborns in the system, with Grindelwald wanting to abolish the entire system and force Muggleborns to be excluded by magical society. His vision would be to take the ones that survive into a second generation into the magical world. Dumbledore's side is for the status quo, with the muggleborn's being integrated into society but (quietly) losing their independence to the system.

After the war, most of what was being fought over was lost. The 'purebloods' who lost the war shunned the muggleborns, as a way to keep from taking them over. Of course, over time, the originally reasoning melts away, and ends up just being hostility toward muggleborns. The 'light' side sees no problems with Muggleborn's being inducted (non-optionally) into the major families: They get the protection, and the major families get operatives.

Fast Forward to the Marauder Era. Riddles official position is he wants to enforce a 'separate-but-equal' society with Muggleborns. Unlike Grindelwald, who simply wanted to cut the muggleborns out, Riddle would let them exist in a separate magical society until they have established a magical family, when they can be promoted to the 'real' magical society. This appeals to a young Snape, who saw his friend Lily get inducted into the Potter family: Her ambitions and dreams fading away to be replaced when James Potter gets elevated to head of family and has a 'purpose' for her. The real screwy thing of this is it is her own magic that does this to her, because of the system.

Of course, Riddle is going insane because of his Horocrux's. Dumbledore fights for the existing system (so what if the muggleborns loose some of their autonomy, they are part of society). Thus how the war devolves into the one we know.

Snape is of course, horrified to watch it going on over and over again in his students, but since his side lost, he really can't do anything. The pureblood side has mostly forgotten its history, and the light side doesn't really ask how the muggleborns they know end up serving them when they have need. Snape's hostility to Harry he is head of family and he sees another Potter Head taking a promising Muggleborn with her own dreams and ambitions.

Of course, Snape doesn't know all of this, so Hermione only gets a taste. She is appropriately horrified by the notion of losing her autonomy, and goes on a quest to figure out how the system works (thus learning the above over the course of the fic). It would include her explicitly setting it up so Harry (as a family head) needs her to find out the truth, thus protecting her from falling under the sway of other families. You can't flee the country, because the magic is based on ones self-image, and as long as you considered yourself a British Witch, your own magic would force you into the system.

It would deceivingly NOT be a H/HR fic, as that possibility would be one of those sacrificed by Hermione using Harry's position as family head. She could never be entirely sure of her own feelings.

Not quite sure where to set the intro, probably during GOF or POA.
