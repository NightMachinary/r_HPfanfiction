#+begin_quote
  The Ink Drop was the best-kept secret in the nightclubs of Wizarding London. Werewolves, or those close enough, could work out their sexual appetites on willing submissives looking for a rough ride, and nobody had to get hurt. The system generally worked best when the werewolves stayed clear of each other, but someone forgot to tell the new girl about that.36,000 words. NC-17 and then some -- for sex, violence and the foul language of werewolf subcultures. Bill/Lavender. Past Remus/Bill. Quite a bit of Fleur. Several werewolf OCs. July 2008.
