Say everyone has at least some magic in them explaining how a woman can lift a car off her baby. The cup takes ALL magic, and kills you since magic is connected to your soul(not too bad of a theory considering magic can interact with it already(ala hocruxes)). So either a chance against a dragon or insta death.

BTW the point of these questions is to ask what you would do in the situation i mean this is a world of magic logic is not exactly used much here.
