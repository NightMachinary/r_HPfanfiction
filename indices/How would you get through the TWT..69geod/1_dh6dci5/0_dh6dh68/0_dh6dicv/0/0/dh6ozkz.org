What if you couldn't take anything, but clothes and a non-existant wand into the arena. Oh i just thought of another idea, soak my shirt, jumper and pants(while having shorts still on underneath instead of skivvies) in something highly poisonous to the dragon also soak it in meat the dragon would enjoy. Get in than chuck my clothes(after removing them) at him chances are if he is part of a reserve he's used to getting fed at times so will probably go for it, if not whelp back to the waiting method.
