I thought to help get the ball rolling a bit more i would put how i would deal with the TWT. With the dragon if i can bring something else since i don't have a wand (which knowing the arrogance of some wizards i can see happening) i would reasearch what could poison a dragon, and stuff that in some dragon meat(by dragon meat i mean what a dragon finds delicious) than just wait if no poison maybe high impact explosives or maybe an explosive mix which when ingested mixes than combusts. If i can't bring anything, and don't know about it i would just wait til it falls asleep which could take many hours than be very careful, and hope for the best.

For the lake if i knew about it before hand scuba tank+flippers+swimsuit+a gun that is effective underwater barring a gun harpoon launcher with as many harpoons as i can carry. If i didn't know beforehand go into the lake, stay under as long as i can, surface and than exit. I still particapated so should be safe.

In the last one. Compass, and maybe a book to wait it out. If I can't bring either still waiting it out, and hoping for the best.

TL;RD Basically wait and hope for the best.
