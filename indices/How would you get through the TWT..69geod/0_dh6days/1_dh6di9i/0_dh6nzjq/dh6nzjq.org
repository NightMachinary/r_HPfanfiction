Just like that. I'd mostly focus on making great adult allies. I wouldn't hope that I could learn enough to defeat Voldemort by the time he returns, though I would prod Flitwick into starting a dueling club after the troll attack and sign up for it. But that'd be mostly to defend myself from school bullies and creatures, not Voldemort.
