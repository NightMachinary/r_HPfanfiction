Yeah, but your going to be involved in at least some of the schemes because you are still the boy/girl who lived. People will involve you whether you want it or not. Same as how people treat anyone famous. Also stuff like the TWT, and POA will still prabably happen unless you try and sort it out earlier, but that carries it's own risks like if peter escapes, possible voldemort earlier so if you don't train for voldemort train for the possible confrontations against a troll, basilisk, betrayer, dragon, umbridge maybe more.
