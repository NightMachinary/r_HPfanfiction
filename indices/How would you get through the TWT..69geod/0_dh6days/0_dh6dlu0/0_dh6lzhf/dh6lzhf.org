Take the Knights bus close to the next army base, accio a couple LAW-80s or Carl Gustavs (that's the British stock of that time), shrink them and that's it.

Alternatively, if the trace is an issue, use my invisibility cloak (I'm Harry, right?) to sneak a ferry ride to France and do the same there.

Now, attack helicopters are not easy to fly and there's not enough space for an A-10 to take off from (and you'd show up on the RAF radar screens, who wouldn't be very kind to an rouge strike plane bombing an abandoned castle.

However, if you'd have a squadron of Mi-24s during the Battle of Hogwarts the Death Eaters wouldn't make it past the treeline. 80mm rockets and 30mm shells would make quick work from anything that moves and your AT-6 missiles should easily take out the giants. You can do all that killing from a safe distance where no wizard could hit you. That might be completely overkill however, because a couple of well placed machine guns would have taken care of the final battle within 5 minutes without any losses on the light side.
