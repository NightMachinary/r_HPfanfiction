As a note, literally all munitions on us army posts are stored in weapons safes, seperate from their respective munitions. I dont beleive british army munition storage would be much different, maybe worse because they have more strict rules on firearms.

The accio would either need to be strong enough to break the vault, and leave evidence of magic that would get you in trouble, or a simple household charm would end up failing and just making a mess of the inside of the safe. This is all assuming that the magic doesn't set the technology off the first time they interact.
