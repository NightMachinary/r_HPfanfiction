Your best bet to get easy access rpgs is to go into an active warzone and steal it there. Peacetime weapons storage doesnt have the need for easy access to weapons in case of attack, and it is kept accordingly.

If i had magic, and the year was 2015, i could reasonably get an rpg from a us army base over the course of a month. I would've spending most of the month snooping around base figuring out where all the stuff was before i stole it. Paperwork, locks and also people to be thorough. Profficiency in lockpicking, understanding military inventory lists, obliviation and also invisibility are all required to get in and out without being caught.
