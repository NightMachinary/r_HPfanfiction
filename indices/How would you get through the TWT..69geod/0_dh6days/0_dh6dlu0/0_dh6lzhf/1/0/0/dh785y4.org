Mind, i havent ever seen the munitions storage, just the rifle storage on base. So my experiences are based on that. Getting a rifle involves sneaking onto post, past the fences, past the locked door to the building and also past all the people in between. Best bet is to go on a weekend when nobody will be there to notice random doors opening. Walking past the first gate to the building will take at least an hour, going at a 15 minute mile pace. The army bases are big.

Next, you need to get past a bank vault type door. With the twisty thing and a combination code and key lock. I have no clue how helpful magic will be for this, because there may be digitial alarms that go off because of the magic, or in spite of it.

Then you just walk in, grab a rifle and the scope you want for it and walk out.

Then you have to do it all again to get munition for this rifle.

This requires intimate knowledge of where everything is kept, the ability to travel large distances un-noticed (eye sight apparition is acceptable, if you can keep it quiet) and very decent lock breaking capabilities.

Also, if you want the theft to go unnoticed you also need to find the paperwork stored that acknowledges what you stole. Assume three copies and that it is in at least two different buildings for each thing stolen. More copies if there is no digital version.
