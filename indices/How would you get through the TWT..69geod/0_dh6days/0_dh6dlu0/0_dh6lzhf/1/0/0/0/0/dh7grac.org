Yeah, probably, but it's much more likely that he would get caught in the act, or after the act happened if you didn't do it yourself.

Either he'd get caught trying to fix other people's paperwork, or he'd get caught because the paperwork doesn't match.

Assuming he takes the fall for stealing the weapons, you still have the statute to deal with because he'll be talking about mind control.

I was also basing these instructions off the assumption that unforgivables were off the table. imperio would make it easier, especially since you don't risk youself getting caught.

this all assumes you know who is /really/ in charge of munitions though. Humanity always has their clueless people in charge, and you might end up screwing yourself over hard if you choose the wrong guy.
