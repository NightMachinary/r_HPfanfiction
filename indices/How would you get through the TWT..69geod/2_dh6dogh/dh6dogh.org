I would get through the tournament by walking away. The contract is "magically binding", but most stories I've read (and perhaps canon as well) imply that the consequence of breaking that kind of contract is the loss of your magic.

Well, it's not as though I have any magic to lose. So if the goal is to "get through" the tournament, i.e. survive for it's duration... just don't participate.

Kind of a cop-out answer, I know, but if you're going to try to force a muggle to compete in a wizarding tournament you should expect an unusual solution.
