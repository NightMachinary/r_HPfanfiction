Okay to not be an ass and answer your question.

Dragon I step in, fail and step out. No possible way for a muggle to beat a dragon with no super powers or weapons you wouldn't have access to in England. (No way can an American buy a hand gun or AR-15 in England on short notice.

I prey on Cedric's sence of fair play and get him to tell me the riddle (if I'm not coming in with knowledge of the tasks already). I max out a credit card and get Amazon to two ship me a scuba set. (I'm scuba certified so no worries about the bends).

The Maze. I step in and send up red Sparks via Roman candles, again if I have access to an AR-15 I think I could take most of the beasts but no way I'm risking my life for money and fame.
