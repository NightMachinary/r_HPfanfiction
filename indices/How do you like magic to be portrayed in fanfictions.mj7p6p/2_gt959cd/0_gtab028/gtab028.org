I don't like when Magical Cores are measured neither when it's just a matter of blood. For me, some are born with natural talent for magic (like Dumbledore or Voldemort) while others are regular, but can work hard to be great.

For example, in my opinion, Messi is someone who was born with a natural talent for football, while Cristiano Ronaldo is someone who worked really hard to get where he is today. In my opinion, magic works in the same way.

I hope it didn't sound too confused.
