A concept as crude as a "magical core" doesn't explain why it's /only/ the Patronus in which Harry is unusually strong.

If an arbitrary magical power meter existed, we would expect to see wizards and witches who are intelligent and confident but weak and/or those who are unintelligent and meek but powerful; we don't.

Instead, we see characters such as Neville who, almost a squib in his meekness, gains magical power as he gains confidence (and that's /before/ he gets the new wand); Lockhart who is not very smart yet so obsessed with how he is perceived by others, possibly the only part of his magic that works properly is Memory Charms; Bellatrix, whose sadism drives a powerful Cruciatus, while driving her to make highly suboptimal decisions^{1;} and, of course, Harry, whose emotional disposition and stubbornness gives him composure under fire, a powerful Patronus, and a rare ability to resist the Imperius, while making him impulsive, easily manipulated by the likes of Umbridge, Snape, and Voldemort, and (according to JKR, anyway) crippling his Occlumency.

These are only the most extreme examples; lesser examples abound.

Replacing this complex integration ofa character's character and their magic with an arbitrary magical power meter---it cheapens magic.

[[/u/A-ksar]] , this is also an element I would suggest incorporating into your magic system: learning a particular spell requires academic study and "book-smarts" (possibly excepting Dark Arts), but how well it's cast in any given instance depends on the character's personality, experience, physical and emotional state, and a variety of non-magical traits.

Don't get me wrong, if your premise /requires/ that your protagonist be innately more powerful than others, it's as good a plot device as any, if not very creative.

^{1} I am referring to Bellatrix's choice to torture Hermione at the Malfoy Manor in DH, rather than use Legilimency to get the information. According to Snape, she was the one who had taught Draco Occlumency, which would make her a Legilimens. Therefore, unless Hermione had managed to pick up Occlumency without anyone noticing (not impossible, but unlikely), Bellatrix basically got herself and Voldemort killed because she was too eager to hurt the Mudblood.
