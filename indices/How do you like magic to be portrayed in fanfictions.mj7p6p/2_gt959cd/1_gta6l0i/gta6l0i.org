Why do you have an issue with people being inherently stronger than others?

I've always thought it made the most sense story wise.

Harry is an poor student. He knows next to no magic and has almost zero actual experience dueling. The only way that I can rationalize it in my mind is that he is significantly stronger than the average wizard (dementor incident) and that's what puts him on Voldemort and Dumbledore level.

Now in a completely AU fic, I quite like to read how knowledge and experience makes you powerful. But you still need some form of boost to get to Voldy's level. He is a master dark arts user for 50+ years longer than Harry. There needs to be some kind of balancing power.

By giving Harry a particularly large magical core you provide a reason why Harry has to fight him and also help even the scales. In my mind it helps reduce the feeling that harry read a few books and is suddenly a master of warfare.

You are probably right if you like fic which focus on other characters. But I don't often read those so Ill leave that to someone else.
