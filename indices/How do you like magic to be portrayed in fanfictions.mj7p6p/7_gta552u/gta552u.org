In fact, I like both, but with certain limits. I mean: without exaggerating much at any point.

It has nothing to do with the question, but I remembered something I was thinking. What if some spell names mean nothing? So someone can say "Expelliarmus", for example, but the result of the spell is to kill because this person wanted to kill. And finally I thought about the likely results of a well-developed fanfic: fanfic can be very crazy, confusing, and brilliant. Because if what unfolds in this HP fanfic is what triggers "the intention is what counts," then when someone casts a spell, you don't know what will happen.

Anyway, for now it's just a thought.
