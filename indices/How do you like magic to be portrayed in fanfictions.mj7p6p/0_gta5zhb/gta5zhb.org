I like a bit of both. There has to be some mystery to it because otherwise it wouldn't be magic. It seems like some aspects of magic are not understood even by those who use it. But canon shows us that at least some spells are dependent to a certain extent to the state of mind of the user. The Patronus requires to powerfully feel a happy memory, while "you've got to mean" the Unforgivables to work and a summoning charm really requires you to mentally visualize your target.

In terms of theories... my two favorite theories are the following:

1. Magic comes from the stars. Sun, being the closest star, is the greatest influencing force. However most people do not have the body build to draw magic straight from the stars. Instead the moon, whose rock attracts a lot of magic, is the one giving magic to wizards (and to some extent further away stars) when it reflects the light of the sun. That's why so many magical practices are dependent on the phases of the moon and at full moon when it reflects the most magic to earth its when the lycanthropic virus becomes active. Some wizards are however more powerful because their bodies are more sensitive to the light reflected on Earth on bodies of water or certain rocks. For example Tom Riddle did his first bout of impressive magic in the cave by the sea. And the locket is indeed the most well protected Horcrux.

2. Magic is actually dictated by the laws of nature. Nothing comes for free and every bit of magic you cast must come at a payment. We see that with the sacrificial love magic done by Lily and Harry when they willingly traded their lives for some loved's protection. Same thing for Horcruxes, where you give someone else's life, your humanity and a piece of your soul for immortality. Of course less powerful spells like Lumos require a smaller payment but even if you might not realize it, they eventually catch up with you. Particularly if they are used for selfish purposes as exemplified by the guy who invented Alohomora and used to commit several burglaries until one day someone invented a counter-spell and in his frustration forgot to put to sleep a Nundu he owned, which proceeded to eat him.
