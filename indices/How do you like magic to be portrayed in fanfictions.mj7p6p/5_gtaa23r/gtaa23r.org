With all things, you need a balance. On the one hand keeping it as vague as canon I feel hurts engagement and tension. If all you see of magic is 'doing whatever the plot demands' then you lose that sense of challenge or accomplishment from the protagonists solving problems with it. You need to show enough so the reader know understands the importance of the characters' actions. On the other hand, if you make it too well defined then you can kill pacing and tension by overanalysing everything that happens, so don't describe every single spell in detail. You may also accidently paint yourself into a corner by the rules you set, leave some ambiguity for narrative necessity.

Personally I am a big fan of worldbuilding and magic is an important part of that, so I prefer a more fleshed out system to play with, but that is just my preference. It also depends what the focus of your story is, don't waste your time on stuff which is irrelevant to the plot or the reader will get bored. If you are interested, I have had a go at starting something of my own and written a sort of introduction to how the magic works which I could copy here.
