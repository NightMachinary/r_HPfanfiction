This is from my introduction, a combination skippable infodump for those who are interested without getting in the way of the story and justification for why I made the choices I did.

Most magic as shown in Harry Potter is quite boring. Wand movement + incantation = effect. This also provided no explanation as to why some people are better at it than others. In this fic, magic is a naturally chaotic energy that grants the ability to bend reality to your wishes with three components: imagination to picture what you want, willpower to shape the magic, and power to cause the effect. These affect what you can do, how precise and efficient the spell is, and how strong it is. Words, gestures and wands make this easier, but are not technically necessary. Generally the power required for a spell follows similar rules to the real world, move something heavier or faster, heat something hotter etc. For transfigurations, they are time limited, with more power being a greater change or lasting longer. In order to make a permanent change, e.g. a repairing spell, the end state has to be a stable configuration of the original material, so you can change shape or separate mixtures, but cannot turn wood into fish. A partial exception to this is alchemy (lead to gold is technically just a rearrangement of subatomic particles), which is why it is an incredibly difficult and rare skill. This is why you cannot magically create food, any energy you would get out from digesting would have to be at least matched by the magic put in to create it. There is a general principle that if something is already affected by magic then it is harder for more magic or physical effects to affect it, as it has to overpower the original. This means that heavily enchanted/magically rich objects become naturally resilient or even functionally impervious to damage, hence how artefacts such as Slytherin's locket survived so long in perfect condition.

Magic comes from the mind, and so has as many different variations as people's thoughts. Spellbooks work like cookbooks, where the author explains what works best for them, and it is up to the student to adjust to their own situation, which is why you cannot just read out a spell and it will work first time. A lot of low level spell creation is just changing the parameters on a standard spell. For example the Lumos spell taught in first year creates a point of light on the end of a wand. With some theory and practice you could change the colour, shape it into a cone like a torch, have it float beside you or evenly light a volume and then stop. As none of these are a sufficiently new spell, and are made for personal use, they are rarely written down, but can be done. I am putting my foot down on time-turners. The concept of magic able to manipulate time and being trivial enough to give to a schoolchild is a can of worms I don't want to go near, especially just for a gimmick for a single chapter in book 3. To do it justice would require effort and focus and taking the story in directions I would rather not. Many fanfictions extrapolate from the Goblet of Fire and unbreakable vow to create general use magically enforced oaths and contracts. In this story that doesn't happen, as even if people knew how they require unique artefacts or specific circumstances.

In terms of magical variance between individuals, in canon, not all wizards (or witches) are created equal. Dumbledore, Grindelwald and Voldemort would not have had the reputations they did if it was just practice and skill that separated them from the norm. On the flip side Neville is taunted as being nearly a squib, and Filch reads the Kwickspell pamphlet in hope that he could still cast some magic, despite not being deemed a wizard. This all points to a gradient of magical ability (which will change as you develop, e.g. Neville) rather than a binary magical or not. Raw power is not everything though, as clearer imagination, more focussed will, practice and intelligent spell use can all increase effective efficiency. Depending how you think and how you imagine the results of the spell, different people may have preferences for different spells or branches of magic. This is often influenced by upbringing and experience. For example an ability to visualise something very precisely is required for highly detailed transfiguration, while growing up next to a stream may allow you to cast better aguamenti charms as you have a fundamental understanding of the concept of flowing water.

Magic also has physical and mental effects on living beings. Magic is linked to sentience. Only sentient beings are self aware enough to create spells (innate magical abilities such as basilisk stare and phoenix teleportation don't count). The flip side is that magical creatures and animals which spend a long time around magic (e.g. Mrs Norris) tend to be more intelligent than a mundane equivalent, though they are still animals. At no point was it suggested that Buckbeak was sapient, but he was clever enough that you had to ask, speak respectfully and then bow before being able to ride him. High levels of magic in a body makes the creature magic resistant and generally stronger, more resilient and heal faster. This also applies to a lesser extent for wizards compared to muggles, so bludgers in quidditch are not completely lethal.
