I like magic that feels magical and abstract more philosophical and metaphysical. I like magic that is full of symbolism. I prefer this approach to the scientific approach to magic where magic is also dependent of the muggles laws of the universe. And for magical power I think that great wizard are geniuses rather than people how have more power or what not. They have a better understanding of magic so they can wild it better. To give an example of an autor that has a magic system that I love is Taure.
