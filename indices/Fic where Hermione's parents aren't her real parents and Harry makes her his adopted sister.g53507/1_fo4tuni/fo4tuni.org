This story has half of your request. Harry adopts Hermione into his family after the war when Hermione returns from Australia finding that her parents have died in a car crash. The story is a Haphne story and is roughly 51K words long. It's a WIP though it may be approaching abandoned status (last update June 2018).

It's called Changing Winds by cedricslove
