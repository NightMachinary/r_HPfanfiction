Well, I do, but that is not the point. What I mean is that this is one of those stories which are clearly neither apple nor banana. For porn readers, sex is too tame and there is too much story to make things steamy enough, for readers who care about the story, there is IMHO too much smut which needs to be skipped. Cameras gently moving away would work for the story much better IMHO (aside from some scenes which are actually necessary for the story).

The same goes for otherwise excellent story linkffn(12181042), but that has nothing to do with the topic of this thread.
