Sorry, but the close that I could get was this fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3150143/1/Vi%C3%A9ndome][Vi√©ndome]], in the reviews one person said "it is a good translation but the author should give the credits to the real fanfic, Watching Me by Avirati"

I didn't read this fanfic, so I can't said if it really is a translation, and it has 7 chapters and it is not marked as complete. Probably the author stopped after being discovered. Hope you can find it.
