Hello, sounds like you found the fic, but as the author, I would have sent it to you had I seen this sooner. :) I found this post just from random Googling to see if anyone referenced it.

And just wanted to say "thank you!" to your SO for not only actually remembering a fic I wrote so long ago, but apparently liking it a lot. :)

That was a long time ago in my "Harry Potter" obsession phase... sad that it's only available on semi-dead sites. I should probably upload it to ff.net, since they seem to take NSFW fics these days.

Interesting that someone translated it...
