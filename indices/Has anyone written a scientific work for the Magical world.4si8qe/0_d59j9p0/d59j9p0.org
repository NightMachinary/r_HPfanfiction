Taure's analysis of magic system: [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VOF1eu_B7qpTeTUykW5ZGK2HJmVAG5WouY71a5AiRPo/edit]]

A one-shot that emulates textbook for dueling: linkffn(8861649)

And also HPMOR, but it's mostly focused on showing why magical world shouldn't work than why it does. And it's not canon-compliant.

That's all I remember, sorry. Good luck with your own fic.
