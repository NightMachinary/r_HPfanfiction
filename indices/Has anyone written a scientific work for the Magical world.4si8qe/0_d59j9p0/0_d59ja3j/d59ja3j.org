  Hey, kids. Want to learn how to duel in tournaments worldwide? Gotta start with the basics. You can't build a house from the roof down! (Well, you can with magic, but that's irrelevant.) I'm Dalton Desulgon, current world Dueling champion and Transfiguration Professor at Hogwarts, and this is how competitive dueling works. I wrote this for the Wizarding magazine Jiggery Potpourri.
