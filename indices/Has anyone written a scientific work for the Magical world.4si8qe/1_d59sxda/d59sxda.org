There is a bunch of blogs on specific topics, most of which no longer updated, but have a lot in archive:

[[http://departmentsofmysteries.tumblr.com/][FIELD NOTES FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF MYSTERIES]] is little like a cross between [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/][SCP]] and Harry Potter. It isn't 'science' as such, but worth a look.

[[http://wizardhistory.tumblr.com/][WIZARD HISTORY]] has some great 'explanations' of magic aimed at a muggle audience.

[[http://livesandliesofwizards.tumblr.com/][Notes from the wizard world]] is more blog then text book in feel, but again, might be worth a look.

[[http://thepostmodernpottercompendium.tumblr.com/][The Postmodern Potter Compendium]] may be a little too flowery in prose, but it might help too.

[[http://themonsterblogofmonsters.tumblr.com/][The Monster Blog of Monsters]] is pretty self explanatory.

Probably not what you are looking for, but there are also a number of wizard fashion tumblrs as well: [[http://amortentiafashion.tumblr.com/][Amortentia]] is the largest I think, but [[http://wizardfashion.tumblr.com/][Wizard Fashion]] still updates.
