Duuuude. If you knew, you'd KNOW. And that you don't KNOW? Dude. This is kinda wild, but I guess I get to be the one to tell someone about it, which is awesome.

Alright.

Ok. So, this was a reference to a work of Harry Potter fan fiction titled 'My Immortal.' It's the worst-written piece of fan fiction of all time, a mystery of the internet, and famous for it. There is no way I could do it justice before my phone battery dies, so, bare bones. Everyone was emo, the entire cast shopped at hot topic, and that particular line was Dumbledore reacting to catching the main character, Enoby Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way (depending on how the author was spelling it this sentance), and vampire Draco Malfoy, as, "he put his thingie into my you-know-what and we did it."

You don't need to read it, for your sake, don't, but you should absolutely read about it. [[https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/16021349-my-immortal][here, have some quotes]], and enjoy this train wreck for the first time, you lucky dude.
