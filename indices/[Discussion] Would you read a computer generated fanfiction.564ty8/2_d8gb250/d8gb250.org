I have read several short stories and one screenplay written by computers, and the technology would have to get much better for this to be truly possible without it being obvious.

Actually I don't think I'd like to read one the JKR was putting out as canon and her original fiction, but I'd be happy to read fanfics written this way if the computers got better at it.
