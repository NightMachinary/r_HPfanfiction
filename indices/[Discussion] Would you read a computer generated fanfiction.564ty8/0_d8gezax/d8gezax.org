Even if it ends up choppy and incoherent, it's possible to get at least a skeleton for someone else to write a better fic out of it- that's probably the max limit of it though, an outline of events. I find it hard to believe a computer can predict plot holes to exploit/missing backstory to embellish from. You'd probably have to throw in spreadsheets of lots of other things like mythology. How would a computer be able to capture the flavour of the atmosphere in the books either? Still I can see how it would be useful for a fanfic author.
