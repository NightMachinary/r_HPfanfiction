For a second I thought you meant quoting stuff from the Canon books. I do that in my fic when the stuff is exactly same: I just put it in bold and mention that it is quoted directly from the books

I agree with you, although only partly. I personally wouldn't mind reading a appropriately relevant dialogue copied from somewhere, as long as it is credited (in the AN for that chapter or something)

I think fanfiction is something that should be free of the shackles of originality given its nature. But only as long as it is credited
