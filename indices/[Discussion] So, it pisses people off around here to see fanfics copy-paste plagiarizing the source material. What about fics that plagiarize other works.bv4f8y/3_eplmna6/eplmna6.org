I think taking concepts and general ideas an putting your own twist on them is fine, but that does not mean simply copy-pasting other people's work.

It also depends on how well-known the source material is. If you adapt the plot of Pulp Fiction for your fic and even use some of the dialogue, people will recognise it and think of it as an adaptation/reference, but ripping off your your fellow ficwriter? It's plain old stealing, and I'm amazed how many people did not get the memo that stealing is wrong.
