  a whole entire concept or dialogue ripped out of other stuff...Like, examples here: The entirety of Ender's Game being plagiarized by that Methods of Rationality story

Regarding lifting concepts of others, all I'll say is that this is a key aspect of fanfiction. Directly using concepts from others is one of the staples of this craft (among other things, like lifting others' concepts and mixing and matching to make something new, or creating a story for your OTP). Because of that, I don't see any issue with HPMOR satirizing or emulating parts of Ender's Game, nor do I find it an issue when other fics do the same. Hell, even for published literary works, people can write books with concepts very similar to each other, legally, without even mentioning it, so long as other aspects of the work are sufficiently different enough. So to hold unpaid fanfiction authors to a higher standard seems a bit silly to me.

Even with dialogue, if it's not the fanfic author's original work, but fits the story better than anything the author can come up with, I don't consider it a problem because the way i see it, the fanfic author felt that this was the best dialogue for the situation. That said, I feel anybody who rips the dialogue directly from another work should credit who they took it from.
