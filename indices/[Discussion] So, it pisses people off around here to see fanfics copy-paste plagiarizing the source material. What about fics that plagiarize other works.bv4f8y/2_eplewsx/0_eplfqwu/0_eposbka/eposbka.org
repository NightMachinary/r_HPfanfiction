Yes, HPMOR contains hat tips to many, many different fantasy and scifi works, not just /Ender's Game/. The references are usually just names of characters or spell names. The author of HPMOR has always encouraged people to pick out the references and enjoy reading/watching/listening to the original works.

In the case of /Ender's Game/, Monty Python, /Warhammer 40k/, /Star Wars/, /Lord of the Rings/ etc. those are all actually in-universe references, because the AU nerdy version of Harry Potter in 1991 is a fan of those muggle works and enjoys quoting them/taking genre-savvy lessons from them. The author wasn't trying to pull a fast one; his version of Harry is simply a fan of scifi and fantasy.
