Not quite. The concept off all of those battles between the 3 factions is similar, as well as the progression of things against Harry's army. There was one line when the whole team was training underwater and Harry asks the rest of Chaos Legion something along the lines of "What are you all doing upside down?" That line was taken from the books, if not in letter then in spirit, but I saw that more as a comedic nod to Ender's Game more than anything.
