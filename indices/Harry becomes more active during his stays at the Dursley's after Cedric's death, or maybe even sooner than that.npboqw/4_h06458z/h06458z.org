Always, when I see "the Summer of Training"-trope I ask myself how the hell that one works with the Trace still working (Harry doesn't become a great wizard through books - he is a practical learner; he is great when he has someone who teaches him practical like Lupin in PoA or Hermione & Ron in GoF but in academic work he is only average - it's not like he was a lazy or bad student, he was above average at his OWLs even with Slytherin, Umbridge and Voldemort pressuring him; he just doesn't have the right temper to learn by only reading a book) and how he smuggles everything into Privet Drive without the Dursleys realizing it. The Dursleys hardly allowed him to do his homework - I don't see them lying low when owls start bringing books even with their fear from Sirius.
