If only a device existed which would connect people over long distances and allow them to communicate. If only someone on both ends knew about and had access to such devices. If only those devices were mostly unknown to magicals, who have no means of tapping them anyway. Oh, wait, phones do exist, and Hermione never bothered using one to contact her BEST FRIEND after he was TORTURED and watched a friend be murdered in front of him!

No, I don't excuse the "letters might be intercepted" bullshit that JKR fed us.
