Hasn't this been done about 500 times? The Summer Of Training has been done to death and back! They tend to go into loving, intricate detail about exactly how and what Harry trains in, but the stories never actually go anywhere beyond that training. He never does anything BUT train, and occasionally pick up chicks for his spatially expanded, time-dilated training trunk of DOOM! Training-fics are boring because they're just a laundry list of "I wish I knew how to..." and have no actual plot.
