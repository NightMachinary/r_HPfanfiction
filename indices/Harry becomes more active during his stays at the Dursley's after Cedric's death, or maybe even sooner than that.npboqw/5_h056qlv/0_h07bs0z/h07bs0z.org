Yeah exactly, I've read that sooo often literally in that exact order- “he does his schoolwork, he works out and becomes fit, he gets his money and learns about politics and blah blah.” One, that's quite unrealistic considering Harry was almost canonically going through a depressive episode that summer, even if Rowling didn't specifically mention the word depression.

And two, he didn't earn it. Yes, there were the scenes about working hard and getting up at 5am but it all seems so effortless even if the writers described how hard it is. It's because he doesn't give anything real up in exchange. He becomes Mary Sue-ish, improving physically and magically but there's no actual character growth. A great example I can think of an author doing this well is Antithesis. The Harry in that gets powerful, almost to God-like levels but there's always a cost, a simultaneous emotional spiral downwards the more powerful he gets.
