And you're completely welcome to that opinion, and are for the most part right. I have read a couple stories that OP is asking for though that fit the requirements. I can't remember them off the top of my head, although one of them had him go to a quidditch camp as well as a sort of just doing what he loves while also incorporating training into it as well. That window dressing is important after all. You can describe two stories as the same with one hyphenated word, but they'll be completely different. Getting off topic there a little though.

Basically there are legitimately good training fics out there that don't focus on making Harry "powerful/cool/capable," I don't know what fics you've been reading, but I wish you luck in finding the good ones out there.
