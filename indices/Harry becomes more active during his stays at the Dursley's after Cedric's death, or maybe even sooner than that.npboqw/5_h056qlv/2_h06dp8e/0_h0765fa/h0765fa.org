It's still just a training-fic, though, no matter the window-dressing. Those tend to focus on how powerful/cool/capable Harry is without him actually using all of his new abilities to accomplish anything. I don't think I've read even one training-fic that goes on to actually use the results of that training. The more focused a story gets on training, the less it is on plot. It's a steady grind upward with no goal, like the endgame of most ARPGs where you're only competing against your own record. It just feels hollow.
