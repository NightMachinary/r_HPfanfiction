I want to read a fic where Harry goes through the summer of training (lifting, running) to get buff and fit, and then when he returns to the Wizarding World, people are like “Harry, there's a potion for that.”

Then Harry realizes that potions are actually pretty neat, and while he still hates Snape, they engage in a grudging alliance to actually train him, but with the help of potions and rituals.

It would be revealed that Snape himself altered his abilities with potions rituals, and Dumbledore with his mastery of alchemy. You could legitimize other branches of magic, too - combat divination could actually be a thing. Divination as a working, useful tool could explain both Snape and Dumbledore's trust in prophecies - linkffn(0-800-Rent-A-Hero) does this super well.

Most of the Wizarding World doesn't perform such rituals because, well, they don't have need for it. And perhaps there are downsides, like eternally greasy hair or a permanent aura of grandfatherly mystery.

Really, I'm just looking more fics that incorporate the disparate elements of magic into a cohesive whole, like linkffn(Victoria Potter by Taure). Rather than tossing time and training at a single thing (like duels), it would be revealed that true strength and power comes from fully understanding and utilizing the tools already at your hands.
