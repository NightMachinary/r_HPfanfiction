  but hated the muggles for all the wizards and witches burned at the stake.

WAsn't the whole 'burning at the stakes' basically treated like a joke by wizards? Like it was rare muggles actually got anything right, and the few times they did, it was just a simple flame-freezing charm and no problem. One witch (or wizard?) literally made it into a game to be caught on purpose, because she found it fun.
