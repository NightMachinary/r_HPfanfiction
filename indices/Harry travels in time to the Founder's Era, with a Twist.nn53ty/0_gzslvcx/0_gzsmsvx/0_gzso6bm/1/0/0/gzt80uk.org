I mean, that is definitely a possibility.

But that's just the burnings.

It conveniently doesn't mention the stonings, hangings, tortures, and other things like that.

So I'd like to submit the theory that while the burning was treated as a bit of a joke, the other forms of death were highly lethal to witches and wizards and that they were glossed over in wizarding texts because wizards wanted to keep thinking that they were incredibly superior to muggles.

I mean, Bathilda Bagshot had Gellert Grindelwald as a great-nephew, and he thought of muggles as inferior. Dumbledore, for all his wisdom, thought muggles were inferior. It's not hard to think that the infantilizing nature of the biases of the wizarding public would seep into the writing of the wizarding world.

But hey, that's just a theory. A crappy theory. AAAAnd cut.
