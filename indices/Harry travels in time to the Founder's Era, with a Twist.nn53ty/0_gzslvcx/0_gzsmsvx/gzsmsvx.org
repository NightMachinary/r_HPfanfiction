It has always being my headcanon that Salazar was not actually a blood purists, but hated the muggles for all the wizards and witches burned at the stake. Over time, blood purists would take the idea of Salazar hating muggles and twisted to suit their own needs and propaganda (like it always happen on history). Harry would obviously not have started the pureblood craze, but would have held some resentment towards muggles based on what he has witness during that time.

Regarding Harry being Tom's ancestor? I thought it was a neat idea that Tom is a parselmouth because of Harry, who got it from Tom. Sort of a small paradox and irony to the situation. Plus, him being a parselmouth is a characteristic that Salazar did had.
