  It has always being my headcanon that Salazar was not actually a blood purists, but hated the muggles for all the wizards and witches burned at the stake.

I know that is a very common mistake most people make - but the whole witchburning thing didn't really start until the 15th century and went forward to the 18th century. It however didn't really happend in the middle age, because at this time the (christian-)consens was mostly that witches didn't exist. That was especially strong around the 10th and 11th century - meaning exactly the time Slytherin was around.
