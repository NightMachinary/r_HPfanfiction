Redemption is an ancient story on FF.net where Harry kills Voldemort, then grabs the nearest Death Eater's arm, sends a pulse of magic through the Dark Mark, and creates a chain reaction through the Protean charm animating it that kills every single Death Eater but Snape and Draco, who're deliberately spared by Harry
