In the nicest way possible please be careful. This sort of thing has the potential but also potential to go off at a tangent we don't need and get so wrapped up in its own world you forget about the story.

Onto trying to help answer your question, how many wizards ever fight in their lives, or at least outside of Hogwarts? Wand magic at Hogwarts prepares you for exams and later life. Anyone extensively trained in combat centred magic would likely have drawbacks in domestic life. Work out in your head which is superior and show not tell, its an interesting idea but we don't need constant reminders of why its so brilliant like we see in some H HG fan fiction where the writer constantly feels the need to justify themselves. If wands weren't the best why does everyone including Dumbledore use them? Another warning and this is from a balance perspective. Have you watched ip man? Cool movie, now have you watched the Indiana Jones movie where the sword guy does some cool shit then Indy just shoots him. If you make this magic too complicated or slow then your character just dies. If they don't die you've cheated, if the magic is for all intents and purposes identical to wand magic then what's the point? Don't be the guy/girl who thinks that not being able to ride a broom well or something like that means your character is balanced. If not being able to cast a cheering charm is the only drawback to your system why doesn't everyone use it?
