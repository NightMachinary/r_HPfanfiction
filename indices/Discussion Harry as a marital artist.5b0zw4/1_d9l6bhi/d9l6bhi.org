How familiar are you with martial arts? Not being snarky, just really make sure to do your due diligence on whatever form you choose, especially because it can be v. immersion breaking when an author chooses say taekwondo and then proceeds to use chinese or Japanese terms.

Also, if you pick an Asian form, please don't do something condescending about how Azns are sparkly and superior to the West.

In terms of mixing magic, and advantage over wizards, might I direct your attention to Sining sa pagtatanggol, or Filipino martial arts, based on self-preservation, and with a great focus on knives and on improvisation, e.g. turning household items into weapons. I think that kind of situational thinking could be very useful against wizards thinking about fighting revolving around magic.

Hope your writing goes well~!
