So are you saying that Harry would access his magic through martial arts in lieu of wand magic? Would he have a wand at all?

Up until fairly recently, I would have said that a Hogwarts-style wizard would win hands down, but since it's been confirmed that powerful wandless magic is canon, the jury is sort of out on that one. A wanded wizard is still going to be infinitely more versatile, because magic isn't just about combat, but neither was Shaolin Soccer, I guess.
