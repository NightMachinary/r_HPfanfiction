'Martial Arts', while usually associated with Asian unarmed fighting, is actually a term describing skill at warfare including the use of personal and siege weapons. You can include, then, the use of swords, axes, chains, shields, grenades, and anti-personnel mines along with unarmed striking, grappling and throwing in that category of training.

But should you?

It's a break from the themes of the source material to make it all about physical combat, and the few references in the original works didn't make mention of technique; the brawl at the bookstore, Hermione being choked by Millicent in their Defense class duel, Hermione slapping Draco, the animated statutes in the Ministry Atrium, and the Battle of Hogwarts were all focused on the causes and outcomes rather than the techniques.

That said, there are a number of creatures in the wizarding world that are highly resistant to spells, so thinking in terms of physical effects of wand work becomes necessary.

And then there's [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tueller_Drill][the Tueller drill]], which basically says someone charging with a knife can overcome a person armed with a handgun, if they start close enough, and that's further away than you would expect. Add in the time for prior thought and movement necessary to cast a spell compared to point-gun & squeeze-trigger, and physical combat can be very relevant and dangerous to the wanded wizard.
