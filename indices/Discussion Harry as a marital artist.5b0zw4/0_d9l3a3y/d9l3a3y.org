Damn, you meant martial artist in your title. I was getting pretty excited about finding a fic where Harry was a Marital Artist who is some sort of counselor for married couples that are having relationship problems.

Back on topic, I guess one of the biggest advantages to being trained in martial arts is that wizards would learn to be more aware of the environment around them and that might help them when they are ambushed or attacked.
