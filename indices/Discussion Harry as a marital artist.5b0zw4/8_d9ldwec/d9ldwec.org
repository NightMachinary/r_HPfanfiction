You almost want to establish a history of wands and a separation point. In Britain we have legends of Merlin and the like, do some searching in legends. Greek gods had symbols of power, tridents, lightning bolts etc we these the first wand like foci? Is a staff a form of wand? A wand is a very practical and versatile shape so it might well have been refined down to that. Ollivanders as a family have been selling wands since 382 bc. Did something happen around then?
