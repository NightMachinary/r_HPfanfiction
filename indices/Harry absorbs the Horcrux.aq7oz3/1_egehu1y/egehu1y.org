Harry absorbs all of the Horcruxes he encounters, starting with the scarcrux, in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6254783/1/Rise-of-the-Wizards][Rise of the Wizards]].

Harry gets some power from the Horcruxes, but mostly they seem to alter his perspective slightly, making him ruthlessly pragmatic and motivated by self improvement. Eventually his hard work pays off, and he becomes strong enough to handle Dumbledore and Voldemort as he sees fit.
