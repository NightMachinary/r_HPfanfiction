Well, I can't think of any where Dumbledore teaches Harry but since no one else is responding I at least have a time travel fic with a powerful Harry.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est by Lord Silvere]]

*Summary:* Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

/Note:/ The summary is not particularly good, however the fic itself is much better. It has excellent and rather unique characters, well planned and thought out plot, is decently well paced, and is (imo) a fun read all around. It is set in the Marauders era and does a fantastic job of exploring a world where the war hasn't yet really happened.

Sorry no one has been able to find what it is you are looking for.
