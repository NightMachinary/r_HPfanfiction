It has, sadly, been a while since I last read this one, but I think I remember Harry having an interaction with Dumbledore in this one, which leads to some form of minor teachings and in the end in Dumbledore giving Harry the elder wand.

But I wouldn't actually bet my money on that, there have been quite a few time travel stories were something like that happened, so I could just be mixing things up. It is still a really good Fanfiction tho.

Its Marauder Era btw.
