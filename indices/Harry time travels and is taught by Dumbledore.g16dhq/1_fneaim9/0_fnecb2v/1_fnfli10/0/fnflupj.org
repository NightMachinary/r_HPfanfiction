Oh, sure! It upsets me slightly that Harry doesn't get over his grudge/hatred against Tom Riddle after it is ever so obvious that he has changed and cannot become Voldemort. Also, whilst I can accept the ending as appropriate, I would have preferred if you could be certain that Harry lives... I fee that it is left to the reader to decide as Harry is MOD and all that, but I would have liked more detail on Harry and Lady Clara after the massive duel/battle. Just a chapter possibly to explain how Harry is nursed back to health and they try to retire peacefully(could work could not? Idm).
