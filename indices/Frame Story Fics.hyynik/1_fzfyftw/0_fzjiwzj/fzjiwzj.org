Heh. I really like all of those ideas - though I'm definitely enamoured of Hermione's edition of 'Hogwarts, A History'. That'd be such a fun thing, especially with her own marginalia commentary and life stories added in. Might work as a melancholy thing too, if they took it in a similar direction to that one-shot of Colin Creevey creating photographs of the Post-War. Might even work as a Time-Travelling Hermione story too, if someone wanted to do a version like that. Definitely a lot of potential there.

In all honesty, I'd also be really curious as to the bedtime stories a Death Eater would tell their kids. Like, what kind of propaganda would those stories try to convey? Like the Harry Potter stories in reverse with more racism? "Lord Voldemort and the Mudblood Purge"?

And hell, the idea of a Muggleborn Anne-Frank-type being told stories while in hiding would be interesting as well.

I say again - I really like all of those ideas. Kudos on that creativity, fellow online person. Might be worth putting them out as a prompt to see if anyone bites. :)
