A parent reading some story to his child before bed, you could probably have the "real world" part continue for a bit even after the child is asleep to show how the world is changing (muggleborn in hiding during the blood wars, Death Eater parent, or just a normal family in a post canon setting . . .).

As for the tales read to the child, "The Tales of Beedle the Bard" is the first thing that comes to mind, but belongs to Rowling. Fanon invented the "Adventures of Harry Potter" books, and I could easily see Arthur Weasley read them to Ginny. I could also see Hermione talking about the history of Hogwarts to her children, and illustrating each trivia about the school with a little story she wrote herself.
