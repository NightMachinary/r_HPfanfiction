I do like the idea of Harry finally talking about his life experiences with someone, be it a therapist or a partner. That'd be a really interesting retuning of the series, I think. It's often said that the tone changes considerably and it's all really inconsistent, so Harry going back as an adult without the naivete of youth could be a really interesting spin on the same events. Same stations of canon, but through a different lens.
