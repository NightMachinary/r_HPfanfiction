reading to children is best based on the tone of the books but there is also telling a spouse about it or a therapist.

it allows one to use the narrator to kind of give meta comments on it as they discuss actions they might have glossed over with an equal.

id imagine discussing harrys second year with his wife would be more illuminating on the ridiculous trauma and danger he was in as opposed to children listening without truly understanding.
