Look at some fanfics on how the authors chose to use a particularly powerful wizard in battle. If Harry is powerful, stop making him yell out spells like a monkey and use non-verbal spells in conjunction with charms, transfiguration, curses and manipulation of the environment around you.

If you want an example, look at the movies in the final battle against Voldermort vs Dumbledore, and look at the cave scene where Dumbledore manipulates a raging firestorm and kills hundreds of zombies.
