No one wants to read Iron Man 1 and 2 with Harry Tacked on, hell other than the Avengers movies try and keep Harry rather separate from the others. About as separate from the others as they usually are. Send Harry off to do other things, like fighting Giant Monsters (There are Hundreds in the Marvel universe), Vampires, Werewolves, Demons, he can even just go fighting regular old Villains like the Atlas Foundation who are Desendants of Genghis Khan looking to take over the world and continue the Mongol Empire, or The Deathwalkers a Quintet of Black Mages who focused their powers around the 4 elements of the ancient world and seek to sacrifice the entirety of humanity and have even joined together into a giant monster call Deathwalker Prime. Now compare, Harry standing around casting ineffective spells while Thor punches Malek it. Or Harry casting spells fighting off a group of Mages flinging around fire and stone.

Remember every Avenger is supposed to be so capable, yes even Hawkeye, that they could probably take out the STRIKE Task force from Cap2, with little to no sweat. So if Harry is going to be the usual 5'6" and 135 lbs that he is in fanfiction, remember Magic is a great equalizer. Normal humans and other non Big Bad guy mooks should be child's play for Harry just like they should be for Tony in his suit or Cap or Hawkeye. Even if you have Harry be closer to the average try and prevent no Name jobbers from posing to big of a threat to Harry just like you won't have them pose a threat to anyone else.

Pairings are easy way to suck fun out of a story buy just making it Hermione. People treat Marvel as if there is only 2 women in the whole world as well, Black Widow and Scarlet Witch... But again with a little help from the Wikia, you can open up some more interesting pairing options, like Lilith Drake aka Dracula's Daughter who travels the world trying to kill her father off for good. Or Namorita who is the cousin of Namor the ruler of Atlantis. Hell if you want to don't break from the MCU, you have Sif, Darcy, Christine Everhart from Iron Man 1 and 2, Agent Maria Hill and that's just the movies and not counting Agents of Shield.
