Don't abandon it.

Change things up. No one wants to read a story where everything happens exactly as in the movies just with a 'Harry was also there paired up with X'. Abuse the living hell out of the butterfly.

Do some comparisons with the existing Marvel magic systems.

As many others have said, don't make Harry weak nor overpower him. The HP magic system is quite insidious. They have all forms of mind control and manipulation. Apparition and portkeys make escaping very very easy. Especially if he isn't against a magic user. Also the big effect spells with explosions and fire.

Lastly and this is just my preference, don't add Hermione. That's probably the main reason I read crossovers.
