Like the other person says, don't make Harry too powerful or too weak. I personally prefer Harry to be written as accurately as possible and I think it works rather wel. Harry has a huge advantage with things like apparition, all kinds of fighting spells and ways of disguising himself or solve simple problems. But on the other hand, he doesn't have the physical strength that superheroes like Thor and Captain America have, so that makes him vulnerable and evens it out. You could also think about to what extent magic works against people. Can he use it against anyone, or are people like the Hulk resistant to magic to a certain extent like giants and dragons are?

Secondly, the Avengers movies are well known for their humour. Combining that with Harry's sass and wit and the whimsy of the Harry Potter books is great.

And lastly I would say, don't copy paste big parts of movies. I see this happen a lot. Harry gets added to the team, but thefic still has the dialogue from the movies and Harry's presence barely changes anything. Think about what Harry being there changes. How he would interact with the other characters.

I suppose it would also be worth thinking about how Harry's magic compares to Doctor Strange and Scarlet Witch. I don't like them much, because their powers are practically unlimited and Scarlet Witch especially doesn't have to put in any big effort to make tge most ridiculously powerful things happen. I like that magic in the Harry Potter books has limits and that can create really interesting situations.

Generally, the Avengers movies are fun, action packed, funny movies with interesting characters. A big baddie that needs to be defeated and some drama between team members. Then we have Harry, who is a fighter, needs humour in his life and is a great leader with a saving people thing. It's a good mix for a fanfic. Just think about what his goal is in the fanfic, and what is stopping him from achieving it? How does he end up joining the Avengers and how does he get along with the others?

One of my favourite fics so far is 'A New Man', but it's sadly been abandoned. I loved how Harry entered the Avengers' dimension in which the books exist and he needs to use magic to prevent SHIELD from hunting him down.
