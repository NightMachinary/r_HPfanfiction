Almost everything you said, exactly. I've written previously about power balancing in crossovers, but all you need to do is fold both world's power levels together. The Harry Potter and the Avengers universe both have distinct power leveling built in. For example in the Harry Potter universe somebody like Sally-Anne Perks would get roflstomped by Voldemort in a fight; trained, powerful wizards (see Sirius, Snape, etc) have difficulty controlling werewolves; and even within the Death Eaters and Order of the Phoenix there are almost clear delineation of 'power.'

From there all you need to do is go "how does this equal out to the [crossover universe]?" Look at the X-Men universe for example. Let's take Sally-Anne Perks and put her up against Magneto. Hell, put her up against Nightcrawler and she'd have issues. Similarly, a character like Bellatrix Lestrange would probably be caught upside down and inside out by someone like Legion, but would absolutely have no issue with somebody like Jubilee.

So the proper, and the best, way that authors approach meshing Harry Potter with other worlds is to simply fold the two power leveling structures together. Each world will already have their own, and they're actually quite easy to line up next to each other. Harry could probably banish Samwise Gamgee to the other side of the Shire by the end of the last Harry Potter book, but Saruman would probably fold Harry in on himself for fun. Hermione Granger would probably be teaching at Xavier's Institute, but Wanda Maximoff could leave her drooling on the carpet with a second thought. Voldemort could probably give most of the Endless a run for their money, but Death...? Well, I think the books already answered that.
