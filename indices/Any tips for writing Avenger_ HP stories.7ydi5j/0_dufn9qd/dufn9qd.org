From a reader's standpoint, I think one of the more important aspects is balancing the power of the two universes. Don't make Harry a God above the Asgardians, but also don't make Harry useless against people like Iron Man or Cap.

You could also look at the timeline closely. HP is set in the 90's, Avengers in the 2010's. If you change it so that Harry's timeline is moved forward 20 years, make sure it's all clear and concise.

This ties in with the first point, but I don't think Harry's magic should solve everything. Iron Man's suit Shouldn't suddenly be god-like because of magic.

But above all, if it's compelling, none of what I said matters.
