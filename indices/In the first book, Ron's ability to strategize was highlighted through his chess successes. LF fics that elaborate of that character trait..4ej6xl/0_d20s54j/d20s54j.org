I never understood why people equate chess playing ability with a strategical mind. You're not a cunning tactical genius if you're good at chess. You're just... good at a game; nothing more, nothing less.

I'm actually happy Ron turned out to be a normal guy who just happens to be good at chess, because I see that trope often enough as it is.
