7-part series of short, satirical takes on the books. I've never read Ayn Rand, but I still found them all quite funny.

Some quotes:

  Harry and Ron stood before the Mirror of Erised. “My God,” Ron said. “Harry, it's your dead parents.”

  Harry's eyes flicked momentarily over to the mirror. “So it is. This information is neither useful nor productive. Let us leave at once, to assist Hagrid in his noble enterprise of raising as many dragon eggs as he sees fit, in spite of our country's unjust dragon-trading restrictions.”
