hahaha i can totally understand that, i'm personally of the belief that canon Dumbledore is in no way a bad person who had any bad intentions, sure he made mistakes but everyone makes mistakes. When i first started reading FF Dumbledore and Weasley bashing was very hard to read for me but overtime i've gradually learnt how to separate my preconceptions of characters and now bashing doesn't really bother me anymore.
