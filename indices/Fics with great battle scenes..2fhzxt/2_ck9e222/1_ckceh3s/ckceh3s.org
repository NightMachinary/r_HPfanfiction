Shezza's battle/fight scenes are good until you notice that they do not respect the self-consistency of the story in general.

It doesn't matter how powerful the battling sides are, their spells will either be missing or inflicting “minor” amounts of damage as long as the author wants to continue the battle scene. After that, when he decides that there is enough “awesomeness” poured into the current battle, the plot armours will be removed and only then will the battle be allowed to end.

Because of this the battles were unrealistic in their own universe, which effectively made them irrelevant/boring to me as the reader.
