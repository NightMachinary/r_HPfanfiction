I always thought [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/9/Delenda-Est][the duel]] in Delenda Est was quite good. I can't remember others though, whether due to absence or the fact they didn't imprint themselves on my memory I'm not sure. So it may be less the fight itself than the circumstances and details surrounding it. Just reread it and it is still decent but probably not as amazing as I remembered.
