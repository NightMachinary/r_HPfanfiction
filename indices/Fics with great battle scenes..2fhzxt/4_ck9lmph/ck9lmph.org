[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/649126/James-Spookie][James Spookie's]] stories, especially [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9766604/1/What-We-re-Fighting-For][What We're Fighting For]] have some good battle scenes in my opinion. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Temporal-Beacon][Temporal Beacon]] has a couple during the Tournament. The Firebird Trilogy by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1229909/Darth-Marrs][Darth Marrs]] also has quite a few.
