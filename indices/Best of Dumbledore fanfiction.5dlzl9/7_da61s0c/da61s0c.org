*Abraxas*, linkffn(11580650): Brennus actually managed to write a very decent Dumbledore.

*Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always*, linkffn(4101650): he is quite effective here.

*The Accidental Animagus*, linkffn(9863146): he still makes lots of mistakes, but he is trying hard, and he really kicks ass in Year 3.

*The Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond*, linkffn(9818387): that Dumbledore is really funny.
