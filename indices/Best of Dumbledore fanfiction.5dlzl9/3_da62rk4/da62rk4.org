So..... This story is a huge crossover, with a Harry so OP it actually gets kind of boring, but the Dumbledore in this fic is so funny I almost died laughing. This is really the epitome of not-giving-a-shit Dumbledore. Linkffn(itachi, is that a baby?)

Also, the crossover parts aren't super relevant, so you can skim/skip them.

Edit: autocorrect is embarrassing
