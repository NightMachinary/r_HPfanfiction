linkffn(The One He Feared by Taure) is pretty badass.

Even though it's not exactly what you asked for, I'll take any opportunity I can to recommend [[http://letterblade.net/thirty-five_owls.html][Thirty-Five Owls]]. It's a correspondence between an imprisoned Gellert Grindelwald and Albus Dumbledore, and the writing is top notch.
