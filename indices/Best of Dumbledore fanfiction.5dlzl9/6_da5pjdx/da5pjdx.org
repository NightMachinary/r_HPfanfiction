I've written several stories where Dumbledore shows why he is the only one Voldemort ever feared, matching wands and wits with the Dark Lord in a chessgame of moves and countermoves, both on the political front and in the field. I generally write him a tad more ruthless and a tad more protective of his students than in canon. A man weighted down by his past mistakes, but willing to do what's right rather than what's easy - and willing to kill rather than let others shoulder that burden. He's a central character in "Patron", together with Aberforth, in "Uncle Quentin's Spy", "The Dark Lord Never Died" and in "Divided and Entwined".
