To be honest, the usual worth (or lack of it) of bashing aside, justifying bashing with “reader interpretation” is a bit like proudly proclaiming “professional expertise” and then proceeding to use a balloon to hammer nails in.

Meaning, even if you succeed, others are well within their right to laugh at you and think you are a lost case.
