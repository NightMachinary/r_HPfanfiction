This past week has been pretty ranty.

I'd avoid it though. A rant flair would encourage rant posts, and many discussions and requests already include rants in them, or in their replies. Plus, a discussion rant tends to have more purpose than a rant for rants sake

If you include the rant flair, it may start to take over the sub and I feel like we could become a group of complaining fanfic bashers instead of a group focused on finding and spreading the needles in the haystack
