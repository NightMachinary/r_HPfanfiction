You're right that someone should have a better reason for their opinion regarding a character's personality than 'reader interpretation.' OTOH, I do think that the morality of a character's choices can be endlessly debated. For example, Draco's actions in canon don't morally balance for me but they do for countless other people.

I checked to see if anyone has written a transgendered Aragog/Giant Squid story with elements of food fetishism for you, but I didn't see anything. Maybe someone knows of one on a site other than ff.net?
