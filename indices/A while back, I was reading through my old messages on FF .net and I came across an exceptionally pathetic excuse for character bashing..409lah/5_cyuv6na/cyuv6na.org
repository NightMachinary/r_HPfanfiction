  Aragog as a closet transgender who is secretly fascinated by carrot cake
#+end_quote

Well.... in the films Aragog has a very deep voice, as the other characters treat (the character) as a male. Hagrid refers to Aragog as 'he'. However, also in the films Aragog is the only large Acromantula, and there is no mention of his 'wife'. SO, it's possible in movie verse that Aragog is in fact biologically female, in order to give birth, and command to the rest of the Acromantula. Hence, movie Aragog may indeed be transgender. As for carrot cake: he is very interested in eating the bright orange haired Ron, a hair colour sometimes referred to as 'carrot-top'.
