Easy. 'Grow Young With Me' first and foremost, because it's an exquisite fic about sad, lonely people learning to be less sad and lonely together; second is the bleakest motherfucking fic I have ever had the delight to suffer through, 'Behind Blue Eyes' where Harry runs away with an Emo Muggle Girl and everything is really, really bleak throughout most of the fic.
