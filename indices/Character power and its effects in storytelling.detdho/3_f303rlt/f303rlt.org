Overpowered characters are pretty much the bread-and-butter of fantasy/sci-fi/supernatural fanfiction (even some adventure style fanfiction). It comes from the same place as anything else in fanfiction really - wish-fulfillment. Everyone wants to 'see' something they did not in canon, and generally actual stories/novels/manga/etc. have characters that are not strong(est) and have to overcome more powerful obstacles. This is both more enjoyable to read (i.e. tension and conflict) and closer to the real-world (i.e. believable within the context of the world since people are generally still people in such stories).

OP characters are very much a form of self-insert for the author (and readers), mainly so they can write scenes with them being adored or praised for how incredible they are at 'insert-ability-here.' This goes hand-in-hand with most harem-fics as well. The praising and adoration are often the point, as in real life that rarely happens to people outside of a handful of political, social, or religious elite.

There is, of course, another reason for the OP character (or rather main characters): its easy. Making your character superpowered compared to everyone else means they can just breeze through every challenge or conflict while keeping the storyline relatively unchanged outside of fawning over the main character. Now, thats not all OP characters, but I would bet everyone reading this can name at least a handful of HP fics off the top of their head that fit /exactly/ this description. But thats the point is it not? Wish fulfillment isn't about writing a new story so much as making the character go through the same story except be awesome at everything.

Now, does that mean I am necessarily opposed to OP characters? No not at all. But for an OP!Harry (or any fanfiction really) to work and be worth reading they must:

1. Provide a believable pathway for the character to become overpowered (ex. Harry Potter and the Boy-Who-Lived, The One He Feared, The Prisoner's Cipher)
2. Maintain conflict in the story despite the character(s) upscaling of their abilities (ex. The Lesser Sadness, The Unforgiving Minute, The Mind Arts)
3. Demonstrate that the story is /not/ solely a rehash for the authors benefit (ex. Bungle in the Jungle: A Harry Potter Adventure, A Black Comedy)

Sadly, such fics are far-and-few between. Hell, most of these are uncommon more generally in fanfiction as a whole (lets say 90% of fanfiction or so is mostly rehash of whatever canon it exists within).
