For contrast, would be my go-to. Everyone's strong in some areas and weak in others: it could provide a very dramatic view of the diversity of abilities within a person.

Or it could be used as an exploration of the effect that much power has on a person's actions, and the way they're perceived, entirely apart from any actual battle that may take place. My point is the basic fact of 'character is more powerful than their nemesis' doesn't have to be detrimental to the story.

Of course, this all assumes a competent writer - certainly there are far more stories (especially fanfics) where they know they want the character to be cool and awesome and powerful but don't understand how to make it genuine and feel appropriate instead of excessive.
