But it doesn't. If you take time to characterize Harry as an uber powerful dude then don't make use of his strength it's just bad writing.

If a character is written as super strong then make use of this. Even if there is not an enemy to challenge him, at least make some sort of conflict out of his OPness compared to his peers, but just hyping him up as some sort of demi-god and then not making use of it is just bad.
