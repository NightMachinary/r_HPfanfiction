I agree. Making a character OP makes focusing on another aspect of the story easier. Not all story needs the classic Hero vs Villain conflict.

OP Harry sent to another dimension? Let him beat Voldemort in a chapter, then focuses on his angst and PTSD in seeing the alternate version of his dead loved ones. You can also focus on the reaction of other people after Harry arrived. Suspicion? Awe? Worship?

OP Harry met another dark lord in his 70s? Focus on his relationship with his family, how he tried to balance saving the world while changing his grandson's diaper.

If the entire fanfiction is only exist to wank OP Harry's super big magical core, it will be boring. If the author can add another aspect that makes the story interesting, it will be worth a read. It's similar with Canon rehash story, you need to focus another point that makes your story unique.
