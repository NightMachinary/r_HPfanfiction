If the main character is overly powerful the plot can move in a different direction, like focusing on philosophical themes or some such, an example is "Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus", in which Harry is a god of death, so she(it is a fem!harry story) is more powerful then any villain could ever be, but the story is much more philosophical then anything else.
