In addition to your example of One Punch Man, I think DBZ's Frieza saga is a brilliant example of how to to tell a good story with incredibly mismatched power levels:

At any point in time, Goku was so beyond the power scale of anyone else in that story, he could have snapped and just solved all the problems. He's not just like 1.5x or 2x stronger than anyone else, he's like 10x stronger than Frieza's final form, while Frieza was 10x stronger than everyone else. The reason this is still, in my opinion, the best told DBZ arc, is that there is a LOT of good set-up and payoff going on to build tension:

1. Goku first has to get to Namek to be effective.
2. While Frieza is to everyone else as Goku is to Frieza, Frieza has a lot of personality flaws that allow Gohan and Krillin and Vegeta to out-smart him and his goons.
3. The Super Saiyan set up is introduced by Vegeta near the beginning of the arc, and reminded a few times later, while being a /personal/ motivation for Vegeta: he wants to avenge his people, and his people were slaughtered due to a vague prophecy that Frieza would be defeated by a Saiyan, so it all comes full circle. The motivation of the character is intrinsically tied to the set-up and payoff structure of the plot.
4. Goku himself gets outsmarted a few times due to his own flaws.
5. The pacing and constant back-and-forth builds tension and releases it at key moments in the story, always teasing the audience that something is coming, making tiny reveals along the way (Vegeta and his multiple heel-turns, the Ginyu Force, Nail+Piccolo, The Dragon Ball mcguffins themselves, Frieza's final form, etc), only to make the big final reveal when shit really hits the fan.

There's a constant back-and-forth, where the powerful are consistently outwitted by the weaker players, realistic mistakes have realistic consequences, and the ending is properly set up with a satisfying payoff. That's how you tell a good story with mismatched power-levels.
