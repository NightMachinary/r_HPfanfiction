Power fantasies are a staple of fanfiction. Ever see a character in a movie or a book suffer, and wish they didn't? Re-writing them with more power and agency is a way to fix them. It's part "righting the wrongs", fixing plot holes or Idiot Balls that lowered the perceived quality of the source material, and part wish-fulfillment catharsis. Because we all love Harry, and Harry deserves to win, not get branded a delusional liar by the number one wizarding newspaper.

I disagree that a villain should be powered up if the hero gets improved powers. What OP!Harry fics suffer from isn't necessarily a wimpy villain, but an overall lack of conflict and tension in the story. These kinds of stories revel in making Harry special, independently wealthy (10000 galleons and 5 estates!), and emancipated from his guardians. All the minor obstacles that Harry had to deal with in the books are suddenly gone when he can have his best friend Cornelius Fudge sack Umbridge because Harry inherited the Wizengamot.

There are other ways to introduce conflict or stakes in a story, without beefing up the villain and making him a cartoonish parody of himself. For instance, an OP!Harry could defeat Voldemort with his eyes closed, but there could still be conflict in the form of dealing with the PTSD of his abusive childhood, or struggling with the bureaucratic mire of Ministry reformation. Balance the strengths with the weaknesses, and you can still tell an interesting story. Look at One Punch Man, where Saitama has god powers on one hand, but paralyzing ennui on the other.

I do think that, ultimately, OP Harry Sues are a symptom of novice writers, and that's why they lack complexity that we expect in polished professional fiction. This is the very reason that OC's like Ebony Darkn'ess are so derided, but with Harry (and Super!Hermione) we have enough emotional investment to the books that their storybreaking powers are tolerable to read, instead of insufferable.
