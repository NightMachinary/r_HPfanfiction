tonks doesn't have much of a personality. most side characters outside the main three are pretty much interchangeable, so I don't see why pairings with less common characters matter much story wise. any Astoria greengrass/harry fic would probably be the same as any tonks/harry fic or daphne/harry or Padma/harry or lavender/harry or whichever else
