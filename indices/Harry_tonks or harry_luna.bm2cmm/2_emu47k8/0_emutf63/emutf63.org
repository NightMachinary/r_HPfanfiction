Not saying this is a bad fic (In fact what I remember is quite good) but this is the fic that got me stuck on Harmony as a ship. I was reading it, having a good time when a thought popped into my head: 'What about Hermione? How's her life going without harry in it?' Now she might show up later in the fic happy and healthy, but the only thing i could think of at the time was (without Harry being there in her first year) she safe? Happy? Or was she alone in life without Harry's intervention.
